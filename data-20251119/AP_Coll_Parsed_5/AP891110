hardwood paneling may lend a stately air to a 
courtroom but environmental activists are angry that a new state 
courthouse will be decorated with 47000 square feet of mahogany 
from shrinking rain forests 
our halls of justice should not be decorated through the death 
of tropical rain forests randall gingrich said as he and other 
menbers of the arizona rainforest alliance picketed the site friday 
the building on the capitol mall will house the supreme court as 
well as most of the court of appeals and other courtrelated 
agencies 
the blueprints call for use of 32880 square feet of inch 
plywood and 14520 square feet of inch mahogany plywood 
according to the demonstrators 
most mahogany comes from rain forests in brazil malaysia and 
indonesia and there are estimates that about five acres of rain 
forest disappear every minute to meet us demand for tropical 
timber environmentalists say destruction of the rain forests 
threatens the natural balance and is detroying the lives of many 
indigenous tribes 
chief justice frank gordon jr wasnt available friday a state 
holiday to comment on the issue and the vice chief justice 
stanley feldman didnt return calls to his phoenix and tucson 
homes 
the demonstrators said the government should send a signal by 
using maple ash or other hardwoods cut in the united states 
but gingrich added i frankly dont think using any kind of 
hardwood is going to make a better justice system

more and more israeli army reservists are 
coming up with a wide variety of excuses to avoid duty in the west 
bank and gaza strip to put down the palestinian uprising known as 
the intefadah 
one reservist identifying himself as joshua a 25yearold 
architecture student said he invented psychological problems 
to get out of serving 
there is a limit to what i will do he said if i killed a 
palestinian kid i dont think i could live with it 
others called up arrive at induction centers on crutches or with 
letters from employers saying they are too essential to the 
business to be let go some claim illness 
it is what israelis call a gray refusal getting out of 
duty without directly refusing to serve which would challenge the 
pride that israelis hold for their army 
some have legitimate excuses others feel their previous combat 
training is wasted on what they view as essentially police work 
still others believe the uprising is not a real military threat to 
israel 
most reservists interviewed said they would not hesitate to 
serve if israel faced a war or some other serious threat 
but nobody feels threatened by the intefadeh said andre 
dreszin a spokesman for the conscientious objectors group yesh 
gvul its not like the egyptian and syrian tanks in 1973 where 
if we didnt stop them they would have made it to tel aviv 
brig gen ehud gross the armys chief education officer said 
61 soldiers had been tried for refusing to serve in the occupied 
territories and he called it an ignorable number 
i do believe that today there is no problem with the 
mission he added there are some refuseniks who decline to 
serve in the territories those are the minority the vast 
consensus is against them 
the newspaper yediot ahronot recently quoted senior army 
officers as estimating the number who avoid service in the 
territories has grown into the thousands 
what is significant about this new phenomena is that it 
includes those who dont usually try to evade service like senior 
officers and guys from elite units said ariela hoffman a 
reporter on military affairs for the newspaper 
virtually all israeli men and women serve two to three years of 
mandatory service starting at age 18 men continue in the reserve 
until age 56 and it is estimated the army can triple its size by 
calling up 370000 reservists within a few days 
since the uprising began in december 1987 seven israeli 
soldiers have been killed including a 28yearold reservist whose 
skull was crushed by a stone dropped from a roof by a palestinian 
at least 600 arabs have been killed by soldiers or israeli 
civilians and 33 israeli civilians also have been slain 
dreszin the conscientious objector who has not been called up 
during the uprising but served 63 days in jail for refusing service 
in the lebanon war said some reservists avoid service by using 
minor illnesses that they would disregard if called up for a real 
war 
they exploit their illness he said they say to 
themselves why should i ignore my medical problems if they help 
me stay out of the territories 
reservists usually receive their callup notices in the mail 
weeks in advance so they have plenty of time to work out excuses 
letters from professors telling of upcoming exams are plentiful on 
callup day as well as those from employers and doctors 
if you cry enough in the army they will say go home just 
to get rid of you you are demoralizing said a 32yearold 
lawyer and father of three identifying himself only as motti 
there are other ways to get out of duty in the territories 
one officer was indicted for accepting bribes from reservists to 
assign them to an easy posting 
yediot ahronot also reported that one man called to duty fired a 
few rounds into the air and shouted were going to kill arabs 
his intent was to have officers declare him too unstable 
among soldiers who do serve in the territories despite 
misgivings some have found their own ways to protect their ideals 
paul 29 a softspoken immigrant from england recently served 
16 days in nablus the west banks largest city but said he 
ignored orders to fire at stone throwers 
some of the guys were shooting at the kids as they got off the 
truck he said i shot at a garbage can

environmentalists will honor a farmer who 
won a battle of wits with bugs 
james m szynal a farmer in the western massachusetts town of 
florence and chief mechanic at woods enterprises will be presented 
on saturday with an award from the massachusetts audubon society 
for a homemade device that vacuums bugs off potato plants 
he developed the beetle eater two years ago at the request 
of another farmer who didnt want to use pesticides it can suck 
potato beetles off four rows of plants at one time as it is towed 
through a field 
the machine can clean 50 to 70 acres of potatoes in a day and 
removes 75 to 95 percent of the beetles according to szynal 
this farmer walked into my garage and said youve got to 
invent something to take the bugs off the plant the sprays 
killing me szynal said thursday ten days later i had a 
machine rolling 
the key to the machine is a blower that dislodges the beetles a 
vacuum hose then scoops them up 
the colorado potato beetle likes to play dead as soon as it 
senses any noise or movement thats why we had to add the blower 
to shake them up szynal said 
szynal has other inventions for the farm theres a vacuum 
device that debugs strawberry plants a plastic cutter that makes 
round holes in plastic ground covers for corn plants and an 
automatic pickle picker 
it used to be id put my whole weeks pay into my inventions 
and be broke by wednesday he said

the attached a towel to a hook and dropped fishing line 45 feet

thought that if i could get a piece of cloth down to it it would 
grab on wolfinger said

because a heavy hinged lid over the opening had been closed

the jagged gray concrete wall that divides berlin 
is a cold war symbol of freedom denied 
it was built under the direction of erich honecker to stop the 
hemorrhage of east germans fleeing to the west about 25 million 
escaped to freedom from 1949 until aug 13 1961 
now in one of historys ironies the flight to freedom of 
hundreds of thousands of east germans around the wall and through 
neighboring countries has forced the communist government to back 
down and declare free travel will be allowed 
and 77yearold erich honecker has been swept out as communist 
party leader by the exodus and by protests by east germans 
demanding democratic reforms 
the 15foothigh structure cut through the city dividing 
families friend from friend berliner from berliner and communism 
from capitalism 
it drew american presidents like john f kennedy who declared 
ich bin ein berliner it drew tourists like onlookers viewing 
the scene of a grim accident 
hundreds of brave east germans tried to scale the wall or tunnel 
under it or crash through a checkpoint many died in the attempt 
the 28milelong wall is only a part of elaborate fortifications 
that stretch all along the 860mile border between east germany and 
west germany a barrier of barbed wire armed guards death strips 
and eerie lights that played over the border at night 
but it was the cold concrete wall in berlin which is surrounded 
by east german territory that became the symbol we kept telling 
ourselves you cannot put a wall right through a major city 
said helmut haar on the walls 25th anniversary now were used 
to it 
visiting presidents and prime ministers climbed a special stand 
to peer over the wall into east germany many called for the wall 
to be dismantled 
but east germany insisted they dared not open the wall honecker 
said time and again the wall will remain as long as the 
conditions that led to is construction endure 
with the political change sweeping in from moscow and striking 
reforms taking place in nearby poland and hungary the discredited 
and hardline east german was finally overwhelmed by a popular 
revolt 
from barbed wire and simple barricades started in 1961 the wall 
has grown in some areas to a pair of parallel concrete barriers 
with a death strip in between 
many escape attempts have ended with freedomseekers lying dead 
in the shadows of the berlin wall or somewhere along the frontier 
between the two countries 
running driving and even swimming thousands of people have 
been caught trying to flee from east germany over the berlin wall 
or across fortifications along the border with west germany 
mention of the berlin wall conjures up memories not only of 
desperate escape attempts but also of major spy swaps between east 
and west 
for years border guards watching out for escapes had 
shoottokill orders but earlier this year the east germans 
announced the orders had been lifted 
according to west german statistics up until recently as many 
as 4000 people were held in east german jails and prisons in 
connection with failed escape attempts the east german government 
has since pardoned them and they are to be released by the end of 
the month 
the aug 13 working group a west berlin organization that 
tracks human rights abuses in east germany estimates a total of 
191 people were killed trying to flee east germany between 1961 and 
1988 
in the first few months after the wall was erected 14 trucks 
rammed holes in the barrier in september 1962 147 people dug 
under the wall in the largest of several successful tunnel escapes 
in 1983 two young men used an archery bow to fire a cable over 
the wall from an attic to an accomplice on a rooftop in the west 
they attached pulleys to the cable and rode in the dark over the 
heads of guards to the west

a navy fighter jet exploded and crashed into 
an apartment complex while attempting to land near this atlanta 
suburb thursday evening engulfing several buildings in a fireball 
that left five people missing 
smyrna police lt jl martin said officers believed at least 
one man was trapped and killed in the fire that destroyed two 
apartment buildings and heavily damaged two others officials gave 
conflicting estimates of the number of injured ranging from four to 
12 people 
my first officer on the scene said he heard screams but the 
building was engulfed in flames and he couldnt get in martin 
said 
by late thursday night however authorities had accounted for 
everyone in the two buildings that were destroyed and found no 
bodies in nine of 12 apartment units whose occupants had not been 
located said john patterson the cobb county emergency management 
director 
five people were unaccounted for in the remaining three 
apartments which were to be searched later in the night 
capt george brogdon of the smyrna police department said 
several injuries were serious among the injured was the pilot who 
was in critical condition with burns and internal injuries after 
ejecting from the plane 
authorities said the a7e corsair ii attack jet crashed shortly 
after 6 pm into the pine village apartments off windy hill road 
a heavily traveled thoroughfare lined with scores of apartment 
complexes and businesses 
witnesses said the plane landed in a parking lot setting 
several cars on fire and spewing burning fuel over the buildings 
the fire was under control about two hours after the crash 
several witnesses said the jet exploded in the air 
i saw it out my kitchen window it was stable then it just 
exploded in the air and went straight down said tawanna 
washington who lives in an adjacent apartment complex 
when i went outside i saw a ball of fire heading toward the 
ground said eyewitness terry scott after the second or third 
explosion the pilot ejected himself from the seat 
scott said he saw the pilots parachute deploy when he was just 
about 100 feet above the ground when i got to the pilot to give 
him cpr he had multiple contusions and was bleeding profusely from 
the nose and mouth i gave him cpr and got him as comfortable as 
possible 
navy spokesman kerry honore said the pilot a naval reservist 
was attempting to land at dobbins air force base about 15 miles 
north of atlanta but crashed 25 miles short of the runway the 
jet is based at the naval air station which is located at dobbins 
honore who said the plane carried no ammunition could not 
confirm that the jet exploded in the air he said authorities did 
not know what caused the crash 
a navy department spokesman cmdr mark baker said he presumed 
the plane was on a routine training mission 
joy schmiedt who lives two miles from the complex said she 
heard two explosions and her tv blinked off 
i went to door and saw flames in the air i went over there 
and the place was just totally engulfed in flames she said 
ms schmiedt a nurse ran to the scene and offered help it 
was a horrible sight im convinced there are people still in their 
apartments they havent found 
a resident of the apartment complex john finch said he escaped 
from the building along with his wife he said he saw a woman and a 
girl run out from another unit engulfed in flames i dont think 
the husband made it out finch said 
martin singleton 21 said he had been away from his apartment 
visiting friends 
i got back in time just to see my apartment on fire he 
said its gone theres nothing left 
he said he was searching for a friend who he thinks was at home 
i dont know if hes dead or alive singleton said 
smyrna fire chief larry williams originally said 12 people 
including the pilot were injured but williams later said he was 
lowering the count to four a check at area hospitals also 
indicated four people were injured brogdon however said police 
were standing by their earlier count of seven injured he said some 
of the injured might not have been admitted to hospitals 
most of the injured were taken to kennestone hospitals two 
sister medical centers in marietta as a huge traffic jam of 
emergency vehicles rushhour commuters and curiosity seekers 
quickly developed 
the pilot a reservist who was not identified was in critical 
condition after undergoing surgery late thursday night said 
kennestone official bill ballew 
a 28yearold woman and her 5yearold daughter were in critical 
condition with burns at grady hospital said grady spokeswoman 
beverly thomas the mother was identified as 28yearold margie 
padovani by susan padgett a spokeswoman at kennestone hospital 
where the two were taken initally

lt cmdr jim lawrence of the naval reserve a friend of the 
pilot said he flew the same plane earlier thursday on a separate 
training mission 
lawrence said it was in beautiful shape at the time he said 
he doesnt have any idea what might have causd the crash 
he said he and the pilot who still had not been unidentified 
both work at delta air lines and had put in time with the reserves 
lawrence said he has known the pilot for about three years and 
described him as a capable excellent pilot 
asked whether the pilots worry when they fly over heavily 
populated areas during training missions lawrence said its a 
concern you have a tremendous concern for the people around here

issue of shakespeares plays the folios were the only collected 
editions printed in the 17th century according to the auction

i never paid 2 million for anything before said james 
cummins a manhattan dealer who bought the folios for a customer he 
would identify only as a private american collector im a little 
nervous but excited 
cummins said he and his customer had been looking for at least 
the first folio for about five years 
the first folio is the first collected works of shakespeare 
he explained the four together are exceedingly desirable but 
the first folio is the one that youre really paying a premium to 
get because its almost impossible to find a fine copy and this is 
a very very nice copy indeed

quixote de la mancha by miguel de cervantes saavedra sold for 
165 million to a london dealer said a sothebys spokesman

the rev martin luther king jrs eldest 
son told the rev ralph david abernathy that the former king aides 
book about his father was unfair a newspaper said 
in an interview thursday to be published in fridays editions of 
the tennessean martin luther king iii said he had spoken with 
abernathy following the dedication of the civil rights memorial in 
montgomery ala 
i told him i have always been taught to love people and i 
still love you king said i said i think your treatment of 
my father was unfair but i told him i loved him and i always 
will 
it was believed to be the first time a member of the king family 
had talked to abernathy since the publication of his autobiography 
and the walls came tumbling down 
abernathy 63 was president of the southern christian 
leadership conference from 1968 to 1977 and was kings closest aide 
during the civil rights movement 
he wrote that king spent the night with two women and fought 
with a third in memphis the night before he was assassinated by 
james earl ray 
abernathys account has been condemned and disputed by other 
associates of king 
after the memorial on the southern poverty law center grounds 
was dedicated sunday king said he took abernathys hand and called 
him uncle ralph 
what i was doing in speaking to him was in no way to express 
any malicious sentiment it was a concerned sentiment it was just 
human nature to speak to him said king he said he spoke for 
himself and not other members of his family 
because of the negative reaction to his book abernathy was 
excluded from the speakers platform during the ceremonies honoring 
king and 39 others slain in the struggle for civil rights 
after the speeches abernathy rushed up the stairs and began 
shaking hands with people on the platform he and king spoke 
briefly 
abernathy told the tennessean on thursday that king called him 
uncle ralph and said abernathy had embarrassed his family and 
him 
abernathy said he loves martin luther king iii and said he will 
be writing him and talking to him in the future 
i will tell him that his father was my dearest friend 
abernathy said i am a part of him a part of me went on the trip 
with him he was my best buddy 
he was a human being abernathy said he was frail just 
as all of us are i want to tell his children that

columbus then there will an influx of millionaires because 
there is business to be done here

noncommunist government will be among the few people who were not 
heads of a government or state to address congress other private 
people so honored included revolutionary war hero marquis de 
lafayette and winston churchill after he left office 
walesa a guest of aflcio president lane kirkland and the union 
federation arrives in washington monday and leaves for venezuela 
nov 19 
any trip to the states shorter than one month is no good a 
harried but bantering walesa said in the interview in his gdansk 
office before his departure 
with the limited time at his disposal i will disappoint many 
and that it why it is not a good trip and a trip which is dangerous 
for me i cannot satisfy americans in such a short time i cannot 
thank americans enough it is physically impossible he said 
in addition he said he is burdened by the prospect of something 
going wrong in poland while he is away 
walesa whose mother and stepfather lived in the united states 
canceled a trip in 1981 because the political situation was too 
unstable martial law was imposed a few months later 
he seems to have similar fears about being away too long now 
even with his friend tadeusz mazowiecki sitting comfortably at the 
helm of government and scores of his union colleages filling the 
benches of parliament 
whatever bad happens knock wood it could will be all 
blamed on me walesa said that i did it deliberately that i 
did not anticipate it that is why i am trembling in these 
conditions i cannot make a good visit 
at a time when walesa would seem able to savor the fruits of his 
victories in 1989 solidarity regained legal status swept all the 
parliament races it entered and took over the government in a 
onceunimaginable defeat for the communists he claims to be more 
burdened than ever 
by comparison his lonely work as an organizer of free trade 
unions in the late 1970s and his years of internment and 
surveillance after gen wojciech jaruzelskis martiallaw crackdown 
were easy like playing in the boy scouts he said 
i think that the difficult things are only coming now lets 
not forget that we are building something now we are building an 
america in the east but can we anticipate everything this 
will be the danger 
he also sees a personal danger for himself the swift passage 
of time and the unlikelihood that he can lay his burdens down soon 
i dont like what i am doing he said 
i was born a free man and now whats offered me is slavery 
i felt better when i was a prisoner than i do now that i am 
free then i could lay down and rest and now it is like being 
under arrest even at home i cannot even walk outside somebody is 
immediately on me 
and so time is running out i want to live a little and i 
dont know if it is possible anymore 
he also worries a bit that his political wits may be getting 
dull 
so far it is not too bad but i dont know i am getting 
older but i am trying to save myself i am doing calisthenics now 
because i am starting to feel exhausted maybe i weigh too much 
just to stretch it out i have started wearing jeans pretending to 
be 18 years old i do sports to extend my life i dont know if it 
is going to work 
walesa said he thought communism was finished a long time 
ago 
but it all depends on what we understand by communism if you 
understand the monopoly of one party a monopoly over everything 
then that has been over for a long time it cannot be maintained 
but if communism was to find a way to stop limiting freedom and 
pluralism and correct a few other minor things then it might 
not be entirely a stupid ideology someday when people forget about 
all its sins

torsten ryl had been a berliner all 24 years of 
his life but until early today he had never seen the other half 
of the divided city 
suddenly all it took was a flash of his identity card 
at the stroke of midnight they told us the procedure has 
been shortened and all you need is a stamp said ryl a waiter 
still awestruck at his sudden crossing into the west through 
checkpoint charlie 
its not my intention to stay here but we have to have the 
possibility to come over here and go back again ryl said i 
have my apartment and my car over there 
a middleaged west german reached over gave him 20 marks 11 
and said with a grin why dont you go get yourself a beer 
first 
in what seemed like a fantasy thousands of berliners today 
strolled through the other half of the city where communist east 
germany had denied them free passage for 28 years 
helmut and katarina erdmann said they briefly left their three 
sleeping children at home in east berlin 
we just wanted to go for a stroll helmut erdmann said 
its crazy 
west berliners also crossed eastward germans from both sides 
held impromptu dances atop the wall hoisting people up from both 
sides to join them 
thomas moll said he was allowed to cross into west berlin in 
less than five minutes 
i just cant believe it he said a lot of people thought 
it was just another trick 
moll 21 said he also intended to return home after having a 
look around west berlin 
he reluctantly gave his name to reporters youre not from 
stasi are you he asked referring to the east german state 
security service 
it seemed as if each east berliner who crossed the demarcation 
line was greeted with cheers many by hugs and kisses by the 
crowd at checkpoint charlie 
traffic jams built up on the western side of the checkpoint and 
people with sparklers and champagne bottles streamed out of the 
kochstrasse subway stop on the west berlin side to join the party 
thousands celebrated on the kurfuerstendamm a boulevard in west 
berlins upscale shopping district 
east german trabant cars were welcomed by cheers and honking 
horns as they slowly wended their way down the boulevard which for 
one night was the scene of the wildest celebrations since the 
berlin wall was born in the cold war 
this is a historic day one man yelled were going to be 
able to tell our children about this

a consumer group is calling for tighter 
controls on toxic gasoline vapors saying that motorists who pump 
their own gas are being exposed to unhealthy levels of 
cancercausing benzene and other pollutants 
citizen action a washingtonbased organization that focuses on 
consumer and environmental issues accused the oil companies 
thursday of ignoring health concerns by increasing levels of 
benzene and other aromatic hydrocarbons in unleaded gasoline to 
boost its octane rating 
the american petroleum institute issued a statement that 
disputed the claims and accused citizen action of raising 
unwarranted fears about motorists exposure to gasoline 
the environmental protection agency acknowledged that toxic 
vapors from gasoline at the pump are a health concern but an 
agency spokesman suggested the claims raised by citizen action on 
health impact may be exaggerated 
nevertheless said epa spokesman david ryan the bush 
administration proposal for tightening federal air quality laws 
calls for better vaporcapturing devices such as sleeves or hoods 
on gasoline pumps it also would require oil companies to produce 
gasoline that releases less vapor pollutants 
several localities already require vaporcontrol hoods on 
gasoline pumps but the devices have been controversial because 
they have been found to be cumbersome and unpopular in many cases 
benzene which has been shown to cause leukemia appears in 
petroleum products such as gasoline and its vapors it also is 
generated during combustion and releases through motor vehicle 
tailpipes 
the report by citizen action claimed that motorists are exposed 
to benzene levels of more than 1 part per million when refueling 
their cars a level expected to result according to several 
studies in at least two additional cancer cases over a lifetime 
per 1 million people exposed it said a california study suggested 
even higher exposures 
despite the scientific evidence demonstrating that human 
exposure to benzene increases the risk of contracting cancer oil 
companies have neither adequately warned consumers nor acted to 
responsibly reduce benzene levels said the citizen group 
ed rothschild energy and environmental policy director for 
citizen action said the epa has sat on its hands for the last 13 
years and has done nothing to regulate mobile sources of benzene 
although it recently announced regulations to curb benzene releases 
from industrial facilities and storage tanks 
the american petroleum institute the oil industrys trade 
group denounced the citizen action claims calling the allegations 
a disservice to the consumers it purports to represents 
gus ensz a spokesman for the american petroleum institute said 
consumers exposure to benzene at service stations is for only a 
few minutes a week and typically to low levels 
the trade group accused citizen action of trying to raise 
unwarranted fears among motorists 
the environmental protection agency recently announced tighter 
controls on benzene emissions from a variety of sources from 
industrial plants to storage facilities because chronic exposure is 
believed to cause leukemia but the new regulations do not cover 
emissions from motor vehicles which the agency says accounts for 
about 80 percent of the benzene releases 
most of the releases from gasoline occur through vehicle 
tailpipes during fuel combustion but a substantial amount also is 
released through gasoline vapors with exposure being greatest at 
service stations when motorists are refueling environmental 
studies have said 
citizen action is a washingtonbased federation of citizen 
groups that claims more than 2 million members in 25 states it 
focuses on a variety of consumer environmental and health issues

opponents of smoking aboard airliners are on 
the verge of winning their fight to forbid passengers from lighting 
up on practically all us flights 
the senate by voice vote thursday passed a prohibition against 
cigarette smoking on all but a handful of domestic flights 
tobaccostate lawmakers long convinced they were badly 
outnumbered made no comments on the prohibition 
the house approved the ban included in a 12 billion 
transportation bill for the new fiscal year on oct 31 the senate 
will continue debate on the spending measure tuesday and will send 
it to president bush for his signature if no changes in the 
legislation are made 
approval of this law is a milestone in the efforts to protect 
those who dont want to put themselves at risk by inhaling other 
peoples smoke said sen frank lautenberg dnj the measures 
sponsor 
the new restrictions permanently forbid smoking on all routes 
within the continental united states and on all flights to and 
from alaska and hawaii scheduled for six hours or less 
the current ban which expires next april applies only to 
routes lasting two hours or less covering 80 percent of all 
flights 
smoking would remain legal on only about 28 of the 17500 daily 
scheduled us flights according to the house sponsor of the 
measure rep richard durbin dill uncovered would be 24 flights 
each day to alaska and hawaii and four to guam 
lautenberg and his allies citing studies by the surgeon 
generals office and other sources have argued that it is 
unhealthy to breathe cigarette fumes from smokers 
tobacco industry supporters insist cigarette smoke is only one 
chemical in airline cabin air which is recirculated they have 
argued congress should not act until the department of 
transportation completes a study next year on the components of 
cabin air 
the congress has essentially acted in an informational 
vacuum said spokesman walker merryman of the tobacco institute 
the cigarette industrys trade group 
cigar and pipe smoking aboard airliners has been illegal since 
1983 
the bill also provides 32 billion for antidrug programs 40 
million to begin building a new airport in denver the nations 
first new airport in 15 years and 14 million to develop new

ask house speaker thomas s foley about plans 
for a 33 percent congressional pay hike and his response reflects 
the barrage of semantics that is a key part of many lawmakers 
strategy 
are you talking about the ethics package he says 
and the initial 77 percent raise members would receive on jan 
1 is a costofliving adjustment not a pay raise he says 
if you are talking about a pay adjustment no one is proposing to 
do that in this congress 
ten months after public uproar drove lawmakers to kill a 
proposed 51 percent salary increase for congress the judiciary and 
top executive branch jobs house leaders are charging ahead with a 
new mix of semantics and timing public policy and financial 
selfinterest 
house members would within 14 months see their salaries rise 
from 89500 to more than 120000 the initial pay boost is billed 
as a costofliving adjustment to make up for two years of 
inflation without an increase 
the bulk of the raise a 25 percent boost would be delayed 
until jan 1 1991 after the next congress is elected at that 
time lawmakers would be banned from keeping money from speeches 
before interest groups 
it was james madison who suggested that the constitution bar 
lawmakers from approving pay increases to take effect in the same 
congress 
this is not the same old saw said rep vic fazio dcalif 
who along with rep lynn martin rill led a bipartisan panel 
that fashioned the plan 
other ethics reforms would include requiring members to disclose 
more about their personal finances and new restrictions on the 
gifts they could receive final details of the package were being 
negotiated this week between republicans and democrats in the house 
and senate and with the white house 
the new proposal also would be handled in a more straightforward 
way than earlier this year when former house speaker jim wright 
tried to force the 51 percent pay hike into effect without a vote 
on this one members will be forced to record their views 
clearly the package thats before us now is substantially 
better said rep thomas tauke riowa a leader of the effort to 
defeat the earlier proposal 
tauke said he would not actively oppose the new plan but he 
wouldnt vote for it among his reasons is the inclusion of the pay 
increase starting in january 
it is very difficult i think to explain to people back home 
that a cost of living adjustment is not a pay raise said tauke 
who is running for the senate 
tauke and others said it was bad timing for congress to consider 
a pay raise before it has taken steps to correct massive budgetary 
problems 
the failure to enact a deficitreduction bill this year has 
required the bush administration under the grammrudman law to 
order acrosstheboard spending cuts the pentagon said this week 
it could be forced to reduce us troop strength by tens of 
thousands 
foley on thursday said he was willing to put forward the 
payandethics plan before a fiscal settlement but others said 
that would be a mistake 
there is no question in my mind that if we cannot eliminate 
the acrosstheboard cuts there is no chance members are going to 
vote for a pay raise said house budget committee chairman leon 
panetta dcalif who is working to complete the deficit bill 
rep jim chapman dtexas said many members including himself 
would be very cautious about voting for a pay raise i dont 
think theres anything about this thing thats popular he said 
president bush has indicated a willingness to accept a raise 
since he badly wants to increase salaries for federal judges and 
his top political appointees in the administration 
senators however have little desire to risk anything for a pay 
boost they generally have more personal wealth than their house 
colleagues and their rules let them keep honoraria equal to 40 
percent of their salaries compared to 30 percent in the house 
and senators have a much easier time lining up speeches 
theres not a lot of support in the senate for a pay raise 
majority leader george mitchell dmaine said thursday 
house and senate leaders have discussed the possibility that the 
senate might accept the initial 77 percent raise but for its own 
members eschew the later installment 
on board or not members are getting the message 
its an ethics package its not a pay raise quipped rep 
jack buechner rmo when he was asked for a stance if you 
cant get the jargon down

house and senate democrats with the help of a 
maverick republican senator are setting the stage for a new 
showdown with president bush over child care subsidies 
negotiators from the two congressional bodies reached agreement 
thursday night on legislation that would increase direct federal 
child care subsidies to low and moderateincome families by 12 
billion in 1990 and by up to 85 billion over the next five years 
the accord was struck after sen orrin hatch rutah dropped 
his demand that states be allowed to issue vouchers for a new 300 
million program to pay for keeping schools open longer hours to 
provide day care and establish a new educationdriven program for 
preschool tots 
at least we have a running shot now with a bill that the 
president might not veto said hatch who angered the 
administration senate republican leader bob dole and conservative 
groups by joining with liberal democrats last spring in putting 
together the basic package 
in exchange house democrats agreed to allow more of the money 
to go to rural areas at governors discretion and let states issue 
vouchers that parents could use to pay for day care services 
provided by churches 
a separate group of house and senate negotiators still must 
reach accord on another provision included in the child care 
package that would increase tax credits for poor families with 
children by 500 to 750 a year 
but house and senate democratic leaders instructed the chairmen 
of their taxwriting committees thursday to try to settle 
differences over that portion by monday night in a drive to get a 
house vote by the end of next week 
were going to move on the child care bill as a separate item 
and we hope to see an early enactment of it said house 
speaker thomas s foley dwash 
his counterpart in the senate majority leader george mitchell 
dmaine said the same effort will be made there but acknowledged 
it will be more difficult to accomplish before adjourning for 
thanksgiving under senate rules 
our problem is theres republican opposition mitchell said 
theyre opposed to passing it any time this year or next 
the senate approved its version of the bill by a 6337 margin in 
june over fierce opposition from the administration and senate gop 
leader bob dole a companion measure was approved by the house last 
month as part of a bill aimed a bringing down the federal deficit 
in fiscal 1990 which began oct 1 
with public opinion polls indicating a large majority of 
americans favor federal aid for child care democrats and hatch 
hope that bush would not veto the bill 
but if he does said rep gus hawkins dcalif chairman of the 
house education and labor committee congress will pass the same 
measure again early next year at the opening of the 1990 election 
cycle 
its going to be pretty damned hard to get anybody in 1990 to 
vote against child care said hawkins 
no one knows exactly how much of the federal block grants to 
states are now spent on child care subsidies but estimates range 
from 400 million to 1 billion a year 
under the compromise reached thursday those block grants would 
be augmented with a new 750 million program of child care 
subsidies with a mandate that states regulate care providers 
another 150 million would be added to the head start preschool 
program that now reaches about half a million 3 and 4yearolds 
each year with the aim of turning those facilities into allday 
yearround child care centers 
bush has adamantly opposed making states regulate day care 
centers and has insisted that any new aid be limited to tax credits 
for poor families with children under age 4 and a slight expansion 
of head start funding

four million americans may have alzheimers 
disease 15 million more than had been thought according to 
findings that suggest the disease and its treatment will weigh 
heavily on our future 
a study of 3623 elderly people in boston indicates one in 10 of 
them probably had alzheimers disease which robs people of their 
memories and their ability to function researchers said 
the rates of alzheimers grew rapidly higher with advancing age 
as nearly half of those older than 85 suffer from it said the 
researchers led by dr denis a evans of harvard medical school 
based on the studys results the national institute on aging 
revised its estimate of how many people in the united states suffer 
from alzheimers from 25 million to 4 million 
the institute issued a statement saying the study is unique 
because it involved large numbers of people including those living 
in their own homes or with their families and it included people 
with few or no memory problems 
as a result these estimates might lay the groundwork for 
developing the most accurate picture of alzheimers disease in the 
us population to date said dr zaven khachaturian nia 
associate director for neuroscience and neuropsychology of aging 
results of the study partly financed by nia were published in 
todays journal of the american medical association 
people that i see do not realize that this is an extremely 
prevalent condition that it is an epidemic that is going to weigh 
heavily on our future said dr bruce naughton geriatrics chief 
at northwestern university medical school in chicago 
the us census bureau has estimated that from 1980 to the year 
2000 the number of people 90 years old and up will increase 236 
percent to 19 million naughton said 
the harvard study consisted of giving brief memory tests to 81 
percent of the 65andolder population of east boston beginning in 
1982 and conducting more extensive psychiatric and laboratory 
testing on 467 of the individuals 
of people 65 to 74 years old 3 percent had probable 
alzheimers disease compared with 187 percent of those 75 to 84 
years old and 472 percent of those over 85 said the study 
everyone in our study whether they had alzheimers disease or 
not was living in the community not in institutions evans 
noted in a telephone interview they may have had impaired 
function far from perfect function but they were able to live in 
the community 
victims of alzheimers disease often end up in nursing homes 
but evans called for finding ways to allow alzheimers sufferers to 
stay in the community with their families 
alzheimers disease is a degenerative illness of the brain and 
nervous system with no known cause no cure and no effective 
treatment save medication to treat the depression that sometimes 
accompanies it 
the disease usually is fatal within 5 to 10 years according to 
naughton who said its first symptom is typically memory loss 
followed by speech difficulties and a tendency to lose ones way 
even in familiar surroundings 
alzheimers later robs people of their ability to cook and care 
for themselves as well as exaggerating their personality traits 
such as hottemperedness or passivity the illness eventually 
confines victims to bed and renders them unable to respond to their 
environment naughton said 
the harvard study points out the need for further research 
because the problem is greater than formerly recognized said 
creighton phelps vice president of medical and scientific affairs 
for the chicagobased alzheimers association a research and 
familysupport group 
naughton said alzheimers research is relatively well funded 
compared with financial support for training physicians to care for 
alzheimers victims 
were very poorly prepared in the medical profession to deal 
with chronic care he said

527 million tons of soybeans is about 284 million tons 
a metric ton is about 2205 pounds and is equal to 394 bushels 
of corn or 367 bushels of wheat or soybeans 
in october the department estimated this years production at 
745 billion bushels a 51 percent increase from last years 
droughtreduced 492 billion bushels 
based on nov 1 surveys the 759 billion bushels now forecast 
would be the largest since 825 billion bushels in 1986 the record 
was the 1985 crop of nearly 89 billion bushels 
harvest progressed rapidly in the 17 major producing states 
during october and was 88 percent complete by nov 5 compared with 
91 percent last year and the average of 78 percent the 
departments national agricultural statistics service reported 
corn yields were estimated at 1166 bushels per acre harvested 
up from 1144 forecast in october and 846 bushels in 1988 but 
still below the record of 1194 bushels per acre in 1987 
as livestock feed corn is the largest and most important us 
farm crop it is essential for the production of meat poultry and 
dairy products 
consumer food prices which rose an average of 41 percent in 
1988 are expected to go up about 6 percent this year according to 
usda economists the usda has not issued its 1990 forecast but 
some analysts tentatively believe food prices wont match this 
years rise the steepest since a 78 percent jump in 1981 
soybean production a source of highprotein meal and vegetable 
oil was estimated at 194 billion bushels up 25 percent from last 
years harvest of 154 billion bushels and 1 percent above the 
october estimate of 193 billion bushels 
the record soybean output was 226 billion bushels in 1979 
yields were estimated at an average of 328 bushels per acre 
this year compared with 269 bushels in 1988 the october forecast 
of 326 bushels and a record 341 bushels per acre in 1985 
the departments allcrops production index was reported at 104 
percent of its 1977 average used for comparison last year 
reflecting the severe drought the index plummeted to 89 percent 
the record reading was 117 percent set in 1981 1982 and 1985 
cotton production was indicated at 121 million bales down 21 
percent from last years output and 2 percent below the september 
estimate of 123 million bales the new estimate was up about 1 
percent from october the cotton record was 189 million bales in 
1937 
no new estimates of 1989 production of wheat and other crops 
harvested earlier were included in the report 
in a related report on supply and demand for major commodities 
analysts said total corn use in the 198990 marketing year that 
began on sept 1 is expected to be about 7625 billion bushels 
including domestic and export requirements an increase from 75 
billion forecast in october 
with demand exceeding 1989 corn production that will mean a 
further drawdown of us stockpiles to about 19 billion bushels 
left over by next sept 1 down from inventories estimated at 193 
billion bushels at the beginning of the marketing year 
still that represents only a slight dip in the us corn 
stockpile compared to last seasons decline when it plummeted 
from 426 billion bushels on sept 1 1988 to the 193 billion 
bushels on hand this sept 1 
analysts said total corn use in the coming year will be boosted 
by larger exports than had been anticipated about 215 billion 
bushels instead of the 2 billion that was forecast last month 
larger imports by the soviet union are expected to account for 
much of the increase according to the new estimate moscow will 
import about 37 million tons of grain from all sources in 198990 
up three million tons from the october forecast but still short of 
last years 39 million tons 
the report said us corn prices may average in the range of 2 
to 240 per bushel in the 198990 marketing year down from 254 
last season the october forecast was 185 to 225 per bushel 
other 1989 crop estimates based on oct 1 indications compared 
with 1988 output included 
sorghum 6289 million bushels and an average yield of 598 
bushels per acre compared with 5776 million and 638 in 1988 
rice 1564 million hundredweight and a yield of 5697 pounds

opponents of a capital gains tax reduction say 
new debate set in congress is merely the death throes for the 
year for president bushs tax cut proposal 
the house took the first step in the new round of debate 
thursday repassing without debate or dissent the same capital 
gains cut it had approved in september as part of a 
deficitreduction bill 
but house and senate leaders say the new debate will only put 
the issue to rest for the year 
this is just part of the death throes of capital gains said 
sen james sasser dtenn chairman of the senate budget committee 
only rep dan rostenkowski dill chairman of the house ways 
and means committee spoke on the bill thursday it removes this 
issue as an impediment to moving forward on budget reconciliation 
deficit reduction and other important matters he said 
republicans will offer their own version of a capital gains cut 
in the senate and the issue will be debated for a day or two there 
likely will be two efforts to shut off debate on the bill although 
republicans say most senators favor a cut it is generally agreed 
backers will be unable to muster the 60 votes required to force a 
final vote 
if as expected the second vote to limit debate fails capital 
gains will be dead for the year senate republican leader bob dole 
of kansas told reporters he would not attempt to attach the 
amendment to any other bill this year 
republicans agreed last week to stop trying to attach the 
reduction to debtceiling and deficitreduction legislation but 
they want to have next weeks debate to keep the issue in the 
public eye in hopes of building support 
asked what chance the bill has of becoming law this year 
rostenkowski told reporters none 
republicans say a cut in the tax on capital gains which are 
profits from the sale of investments would spur investment and 
create jobs democrats call it a tax cut for the wealthy and cite 
estimates that 80 percent of the benefit from a reduction would go 
to those with incomes more than 200000 a year 
the cut approved by the house on thursday would exclude from 
taxation 30 percent of the gains on assets sold before dec 31 
1991 after that only gains resulting solely from inflation would 
be excluded 
present law fully taxes capital gains at the same rates applied 
to wages and other income 
the senate republican plan would allow an exclusion based on how 
long an asset was held if property was owned for more than a year 
5 percent of the profit would be excluded from tax the excluded 
portion would increase by 5 percentage points each year up to a 
maximum of seven years thus 35 percent of the profit from the 
sale of an asset owned more than seven years would escape taxation

old soldiers die but they never 
fade away at the old soldiers home where they celebrate veterans 
day with memories of glory past and make no apologies for the place 
they live 
this is my home and im proud of it says lawson g taylor 
71 a twoyear resident of the barboursville veterans home i won 
3 in bingo last night 
barboursville is one of many such homes in west virginia where 
veterans often rebuilding lives broken by injuries and rejection 
try to put things back together and relive tales of old battles 
west virginia sent more soldiers per capita to the korean war 
than any other state and the states casualty rate in vietnam was 
the highest in the nation 288 per 100000 residents according to 
federal statistics 
some say the states traditionally poor economy pushes more 
soldiers to war others attribute the figures to a fighting spirit 
among people whose ancestors conquered rugged terrain and seceded 
from virginia during the civil war 
west virginia is a very patriotic state secretary of state 
ken hechler said we have a lot of hunters who are very good in 
the use of guns a few of them join up because of the tough times 
at home 
west virginia officials say the state hasnt received a fair 
return on its investment while the states residents paid 159 
billion in federal taxes that went toward defense spending in 1987 
only 322 million in defenserelated work was funneled back to the 
state according to a study by employment research associates 
west virginia is first in war first in peace and last in the 
hearts of the pentagon hechler said 
but barboursville residents say they arent bitter and draw 
from a healthy reservoir of patriotism even when it isnt veterans 
day which will be observed on saturday 
if we ever have a war on our shores the enemy will be in 
trouble said david hall a 41yearold vietnam veteran and 
resident of the home if they got as far as west virginia they 
wouldnt get much farther 
war was just something that had to be done we had a man who 
told us what to do and we did it said taylor a world war ii 
veteran ive never talked to a west virginian who came back and 
said he was sorry he went 
about 115 veterans live in the barboursville home a former 
state hospital that was renovated in 1975 the average stay is 16 
months and residents double triple or quadrupleup in cramped 
quarters formerly used by mental patients 
the library is stacked with american history books and 
newspapers and the place is festooned with enough red white and 
blue to look like victory for an enterprising flagmaker thick 
clouds of cigarette smoke seem to hang everywhere 
theres little anger toward those who fled to canada to avoid 
the vietnam draft and those who protested the war 
my choice was to enlist and go to war hall said those 
who left for other countries they have to live with themselves 
but mention the flag and burning it and it sets off a 
torrent of comment about kids who dont know enough to respect 
it and the ideals it stands for 
when you are in the services when you see the flag go up the 
pole you get a feeling in your body chills go up your spine you 
still get that feeling said jack messenger 58 a korean war 
veteran who said he got tired of living alone and moved into the 
home a month ago 
stewart breeding 56 said most people learn about war through 
pictures movies and news accounts not by living through it 
if he goes to a war zone and sees what we went through he 
wouldnt go do that breeding said of the flag burners 
i dont believe in burning the flag but i dont believe in 
beating the stuff out of a man on the steps of the capitol hall 
said id want to prevent a man from burning the flag and prevent 
a man from getting beat up for burning it

five cities are making their pitches to host 
the 1992 democratic national convention and party chairman ron 
brown says the decision will be based on facilities not electoral 
politics 
a selection committee of the democratic national committee was 
finishing a twoday meeting today to hear formal presentations from 
the five cities in the running 
they are cleveland with its suburb of brook park ohio 
detroit houston new orleans and new york 
the panel may pare the list to three or four and the members 
will visit those finalists 
but brown said he would regard the committees final choice only 
as a recommendation and that he will make the final decision 
i want a city that has facilities that will allow us to have a 
firstclass convention that will be able to nominate the next 
president of the united states brown said it is principally 
what kind of facilities what kind of financial package the local 
support that were going to have 
there has been no decision made yet on where this convention 
is going to be brown told the committee it is truly an open 
process 
seattle miami and atlanta have withdrawn their bids several 
other major cities including los angeles san francisco dallas 
and chicago declined to make a bid 
most cited the requirement that the party have unlimited access 
to the convention hall for three months before the convention as 
the reason for withdrawing or not bidding the party also said each 
city would have to be prepared to invest 15 million 
the democrats met last year in atlanta and the republicans met 
in new orleans detroit was the site of the 1980 gop convention 
and the democrats met in new york in 1976 and 1980 
brown told reporters he didnt feel any need to look in one 
particular region as a symbolic selection and didnt believe 
selection of a city would make much difference in democratic 
chances of carrying that state or region in 1992 
it certainly hasnt been the case in the past he said it 
is not going to be a principal consideration in these 
deliberations

lawmakers expect president bush to sign 
legislation on oil spill liability that they hail as an 
enormously significant environmental step forward from the days 
before the exxon valdez disaster 
the bill approved 3755 by the house on thursday gives the 
strongest possible incentives for those who transport and produce 
oil to take every precaution that is humanly possible to avoid a 
spill said rep gerry studds dmass 
we have every reason to expect this bill to be signed he 
said 
rep don young ralaska agreed the measure would be signed 
after it goes through conference committee to work out differences 
with the senate version 
young called it a pretty good bill but said it would need 
finetuning to ease restrictions on the oil industry 
during two days of debate the house loaded its bill with 
amendments to strengthen its environmental language the oil 
industry strongly fought the additions arguing lawmakers were 
making oil hauling prohibitively expensive 
young led the effort thursday to remove a provision added by 
rep george miller dcalif to make simple negligence instead of 
gross negligence the standard by which an oil company or carrier 
would have to pay unlimited damages under federal law 
with the defeat of the last miller amendment the president 
will sign the bill young said he said the amendment was an 
attempt to embarrass the president because it would cause him to 
veto a bill seen as the chief congressional response to the exxon 
valdez spill 
the tanker spilled 11 million gallons of crude oil into alaskas 
prince william sound in the march accident devastating miles of 
scenic coastland 
this is an enormously significant environmental step 
forward studds said of the bill 
it took tragically as in human nature is so often the case 
a disaster of the dimensions of prince william sound to provide the 
public focus and spur the congress to act far more quickly than 
they have in previous years he said 
the most significant vote on the legislation was the approval 
wednesday of an amendment by miller and studds to allow states to 
set stricter liability laws than the federal government that 
provision also is in the senate version 
twentyeight states have their own oil spill liability statutes 
and 19 of them require unlimited liability 
a key provision approved thursday would require all tankers that 
come into us ports to have double bottoms within seven years and 
double hulls within 15 years of the bills enactment 
new tankers would have be built with double hulls and double 
bottoms and those already in use would have to be refitted 
when i see people like the builder of the valdez the company 
that is repairing it saying that there would have been 
environmental protection a 50 percent reduction in the loss of oil 
if there had been a double bottom im impressed said rep 
robert torricelli dnj who wrote the language on double bottoms 
the senate narrowly defeated a similar provision 
young said he didnt think the torricelli provision would 
survive housesenate negotiations in its present form although he 
thought the final version would call for some kind of improved 
technology on ships

the nations roman catholic bishops ended their 
annual fall meeting by urging israel to negotiate terms of an 
independent palestinian homeland and rejecting condom education as 
means of preventing aids 
over the objections of some american jewish leaders the 
national conference of catholic bishops unanimously approved 
thursday a policy statement on the middle east that declares 
palestinians have a right to participate as equals in 
negotiations affecting their destiny and the right to a homeland 
the conclusion which follows from these assertions is as clear 
as it has been controversial palestinian representation in middle 
east negotiations leading to palestinian territorial and political 
sovereignty the bishops said 
the policy statement on aids declared condom education 
represents a quickfix approach to the aids crisis that 
promotes a false sense of security 
youre dealing with a deadly terminal illness to suggest to 
anyone to use a device that may not work is a very dangerous 
admonition said archbishop roger mahony chairman of the 
committee that drafted the statement 
both the middle east and condom education stands drew criticism 
rabbi a james rudin and judith h banki of the american jewish 
committee said the bishops call for palestinian sovereignty 
removes incentives for flexibility and accommodation on the part 
of palestinian leadership 
and jay blotcher a spokesman for the aids coalition to unleash 
power said not giving youngsters information about condoms is 
abandoning them to death 
the bishops statement on middle east affairs called on the 
administration to increase talks with palestinians support a 
palestinian homeland press arab states to normalize relations with 
israel and urge all foreign nations including syria and israel 
to withdraw from lebanon 
the bishops also called upon the arab states and palestinians to 
recognize israels right to exist and said there must be 
negotiated limits on palestinian sovereignty to protect israels 
security 
cardinal bernard law of boston said the statement is a sorely 
needed invitation to dialogue for the cause of peace in the middle 
east 
the wideranging aids statement opposes universal mandatory aids 
testing calls for increasing federal funds for aids research and 
denounces violence and discrimination against those suffering from 
the fatal disease as immoral 
the threat of aids is real and great precisely though 
because of their terror people act without reason said 
archbishop john may of st louis outgoing president of the 
bishops conference persons with aids are often shunned they 
lose their jobs they cant rent homes schools wont educate them 
insurance companies wont cover them 
as moral leaders we say that sort of discrimination is a 
scandal and compassion is the only gospel response 
the statement drops an assertion in a 1987 document that the 
church could tolerate public school education on condoms as long as 
sexual abstinence was taught as the only morally correct and 
medically sure way to prevent aids 
on condom education the statement approved thursday said the 
safesex approach to preventing hivaids though frequently 
advocated compromises human sexuality and can lead to promiscuous 
sexual behavior 
archbishop daniel e pilarczyk of cincinnati the newly elected 
conference president said in an interview priests would still be 
able to counsel condom use in individual cases if it seemed the 
only recourse for an individual who would refuse to remain chaste

the nations governors say they will seek help 
from members of congress and experts in the business and education 
fields in keeping their promise to set up national education goals 
by the end of february 
emerging from a white house meeting with bush administration 
officials thursday governors said they will also hold a dec 7 
task force on education meeting in washington and are seeking state 
hearings and discussions in december and january 
we promised in charlottesville to put this national education 
goals on the front burner for the governors on the front burner 
for the white house and were keeping it on a very very fast 
track said arkansas gov bill clinton a democrat 
the drive for national goals came from the education summit 
president bush and the nations governors held in late september at 
the university of virginia in charlottesville 
clinton said the governors will seek the views of congress and 
other educational experts before recommending targets for the 
nations schools 
before the summit we let the leadership of both parties of 
congress know that we needed their help and support and their 
involvement in order to do anything meaningful to restructure the 
schools and to get greater flexibility in the expending existing 
federal programs said clinton 
congress and educators were excluded from the twoday summit 
that concluded nationwide goals are needed to improve learning 
south carolina gov carroll campbell a republican said 
governors want to form a true coalition between the congress the 
states and the executive branch of the white house in trying to 
build a consensus to improve education in the country 
iowa gov terry branstad chairman of the national governors 
association and a republican said congress will be asked to begin 
immediately to work on legislation that would bring more 
flexibility to regulations attached to many federal education 
programs 
looser restrictions on federal funding was discussed at the 
summit other summit goals were to improve early childhood 
programs restructure school systems to make educators more 
accountable keep drugs out of schools bolster onthejob 
education improve literacy and reduce the national dropout rate 
branstad led the group of governors who met at the white house 
with chief of staff john sununu roger porter the presidents 
domestic policy adviser budget director richard darman and 
education secretary lauro cavazos 
after the dec 7 washington meeting of education experts the 
governors will hold state hearings and discussions in their 
respective states in december and january said nga vice chairman 
booth gardner of washington state 
once the goals are adopted said campbell governors will focus 
on strategies for reaching them and tackling the rest of the 
ambitious agenda we set at the summit 
goals are the essential first step toward what the governors 
are really after results in the classroom and in the workforce

the centers for disease control wants to 
undertake a major survey of the aids risk among surgeons as part of 
its effort to determine the particular risks in health care 
professions 
its very delicate said dr david m bell of the cdc in 
atlanta explaining negotiations with members of the surgical 
profession he said surgeons are concerned that patients for 
example could demand the results of aids tests for all patients 
he said the method of conducting the test is in place if the 
agreement can be made 
bell mentioned the proposed study thursday when asked to comment 
on allegations made at a congressional hearing that government 
health officials are grossly understating the possible risk of 
contracting aids 
dr lorraine day chief of orthopedic surgery at san francisco 
general hospital said the government fears health care workers 
will deny treatment to hivinfected patients if all the risks are 
known 
she told the house education and labor subcommittee on health 
and safety that cdc and others have been off the mark in their 
assessment of the aids risk she said the same argument used now 
that aids is not transmitted by saliva was used in 1983 to rule out 
transmission of the virus by blood transfusions and the number of 
documented cases in each instance was the same five 
there are more things we need to do bell acknowledged but 
said there are huge masses of data indicating what the risks 
are 
he said health care professional need to ensure that instruments 
and techniques are not inherently hazardous 
three surgeons in the last 10 years who engaged in none of the 
highrisk behavior associated with aids have contracted the 
disease he said we have the feeling that while its true that 
these are cases of aids and not hiv infection we have the feeling 
that after 10 years we would see more than three surgeons its a 
feeling he said 
the subcommittee is conducting hearings on proposed federal 
regulations to limit the spread of bloodborne pathogens such as 
the aids and hepatitis b viruses 
day said the same reluctance to look at possible aids infection 
through contact with unbroken skin and saliva is cheating the 
public of important knowledge 
the government says aids is spread through sexual contact 
needles or syringes shared by drug abusers infected blood or blood 
products and from infected pregnant women to their offspring 
day said the growing risk of aids cases prompted her to resign 
effective feb 1 1990 from the hospital the hospital has san 
franciscos only trauma center and is one of the foremost aids 
research centers in the country 
i personally know 13 surgeons who are hiv positive from 
occupational exposure she said adding patients have a right to 
know if their physicians are infected 
bell said as for possible transmission of aids through contact 
with unbroken skin we just dont see that 
he said there is nothing to suggest that transmission through 
the highspeed tools used in an operating room is a risk 
one study cited by day showed that the aids virus lived seven 
days outside the body but bell said that involved higher 
concentrations than in any operating room or the worst aids 
patient

gov michael dukakis quashed rumors that he might 
resign to spend more time with his wife kitty as she prepared to 
leave the hospital where she has been recovering after drinking 
rubbing alcohol 
mrs dukakis family said she may leave the brigham and womens 
hospital today four days after she drank the poisonous fluid 
dukakis issued his first public statement about his wife 
thursday after spending two days at her bedside he vowed to stand 
by her and to serve out the remaining 14 months of his term 
we have a tremendous amount of work to do here dukakis said 
he said he had faith in his wifes ability to rebound i love 
kitty im going to stand by her just as shes always stood by me 
were in this thing together 
dukakis also alluded to the strain of the past year beginning 
with his defeat to george bush in the presidential race last nov 8 
this has been a very difficult week for kitty and for me and 
for our family and its been a difficult year he said many 
families have troubles like this you do your very best to deal 
with it and then you go on 
mrs dukakis was treated for alcoholism in february and 
previously has admitted to a long period of abusing diet pills 
some alcohol and drug abuse experts around the country said it 
was not uncommon for recovering alcoholics to reach for anything 
containing alcohol if they suddenly get a craving one specialist 
said it did not sound like a suicidal gesture 
sometimes people will drink any alcohol when theyre craving 
the drink said dominic ciraulo a senior consultant in substance 
abuse at new england medical center in boston sometimes the 
craving for alcohol becomes so intense that they ignore the risks 
markku linnoila clinical director of the national institute on 
alcohol abuse and alcoholism in bethesda md said he could not 
comment directly on the dukakis case but in such a situation it 
certainly looks like a fairly desperate individual doing something 
out of the ordinary 
mrs dukakis was taken to the hospital by ambulance monday night 
after experiencing severe reaction to drinking rubbing alcohol 
said dr gerald plotkin the dukakis family physician 
mrs dukakis was said to be suffering from depression and 
exhaustion stemming from a busy schedule of speaking engagements 
and work on her upcoming book she recently returned from a trip to 
colorado where she participated in an outward bound program

the adoration for philippine president corazon 
aquino is perhaps somewhat diminished from three years ago when she 
received the most thunderous reception congress ever gave a foreign 
leader 
mrs aquinos return visit this week is far more lowkey than it 
was then a time when she was still able to coast on her image as 
symbol of modest righteousness triumphant over the corruption and 
extravagance of the marcos era 
it was a time when us lawmakers were so taken with aquinos 
eloquence in an appearance before congress that they quickly 
lavished 200 million in extra aid on the philippines prompting 
capitol hill wags to call it the largest honorarium in american 
history 
the affection for mrs aquino was and still is genuine but 
as any diplomat knows relations among sovereign states are based 
not on heartfelt sentimentality but compelling national interests 
the issue now for americans and filipinos is not so much whether 
democracy can survive the communist insurgency seems less 
menacing than before but rather what kind of relationship the two 
countries should have 
can the us bases in the philippines survive the growing 
nationalism among filipinos does the pentagon need all those 
military facilities now that so many people are saying the cold war 
is over 
does a large us aid program enable the philippines to defer 
badly needed but politically painful reforms should aid be 
replaced by trade or is a combination of both the best approach 
mrs aquino seems sensitive to the notion that there are limits 
to us aid levels and her visit here emphasizes trade and 
investment instead the military base question was not even on her 
agenda with president bush although she was meeting this afternoon 
with defense secretary dick cheney 
its hard to overestimate the difficulties she faces back home 
she presides over a country where 40 percent live below the poverty 
line where the per capita income of 700 a year is less than a 
quarter of south koreas and where servicing of the nations 28 
billion foreign debt is a continuing drain on cash assets 
exceeding foreign aid from all sources combined 
but its the base issue that is expected to dominate 
usfilipino relations between now and september 1991 when the 
us leases on subic bay naval base and clark air base expire 
preliminary talks start next month 
discussions last year over base compensation for the filipinos 
generated considerable acrimony with the two sides arguing 
bitterly not only over aid levels but also over who gets the most 
benefit from the us military presence which includes 36000 
americans and their dependents 
the installations provide 68000 jobs to the local economy but a 
significant minority of filipinos look on the us presence as an 
infringement on national sovereignty 
sensing that the welcome mat may be withdrawn us officials 
have begun speculating publicly about transferring the facilities 
elsewhere in the pacific mentioning such locations as australia 
and palau 
but bush expressed confidence on thursday that the two sides 
will reach an agreement that will prolong the us military 
presence in the philippines 
mrs aquino didnt mention the subject in her arrival statement 
and brushed aside a reporters question about it unlike three 
years ago shes been playing hard to get 
the base problem hangs over the relationship much like the gray 
cloud that sprinkled rain on bush and mrs aquino thursday morning 
as they stood on the white house south lawn 
still bush was able to put things in perspective recalling the 
halcyon days of 1986 bush said 
from main street to wall street america loves the 
philippines and america loves cory aquino

president bush will be meeting with israeli 
prime minister yitzhak shamir next week after all 
the invitation for next wednesdays meeting was issued thursday 
almost two months after israel first sought it while making 
arrangements for shamirs visit to address jewish groups in 
cincinnati and los angeles 
shamir arrives in new york on monday and his aides had been 
holding his schedule open in hopes that bush would invite him to 
meet with him 
israeli officials were upset and mystified by the us delay 
believing that israel had appeased us requirements by adopting 
secretary of state james a baker iiis proposal to begin making 
arrangements for palestinian elections in the israelioccupied west 
bank and gaza strip 
but baker speaking to reporters aboard a plane whic brought him 
wednesday from australia said he had made clear to israel that he 
rejected the assurances it sought regarding the talks with a 
palestinian delegation 
its all very curious did the israelis misunderstand or is 
baker trying to send some sort of signal said one state 
department official 
a white house statement on next wednesdays meeting said bush 
wanted to talk with shamir about steps to advance the middle east 
peace process 
israel gave its qualified approval to bakers blueprint on 
sunday but asked for his assurances on several matters including 
the exclusion of the palestine liberation organization from any 
talks 
the state department said thursday that another in a series of 
meetings between us embassy officials and plo representatives was 
held in tunis on tuesday to discuss the election proposal it did 
not elaborate 
the united states is still awaiting word from egypt which has 
also been speaking for the plo on whether the baker plan has been 
accepted 
the plan calls for elections to pick palestinian delegates who 
would negotiate with israeli authorities for selfgovernment in the 
west bank and gaza 
the crux of the problem concerns the makeup of the palestinian 
delegation that will discuss the election procedures with israel a 
us official said thursday 
to win the plos backing for the plan baker has proposed that 
some of the delegates be palestinians living in exile but israel 
fearing that any exiled palestinian would be a de facto plo member 
is insisting that only palestinians from the territories be 
permitted to take part 
two weeks ago presidential spokesman marlin fitzwater said a 
bushshamir meeting was likely but later in the day his office 
issued a terse statement saying no decision had been made on such a 
meeting and that shamir would be here on a private visit 
bush asked at a news conference earlier this week whether he 
would meet with shamir said he would be willing to consider such a 
meeting as long as the two sides have something positive to talk 
about 
it would have been highly unusual for an american president to 
refuse to meet with an israeli leader israel is the largest 
recipient of us aid getting 3 billion each year and is one of 
washingtons top allies

it was quite simply the biggest party that 
funloving berliners ever had 
hours after east germany opened the wall it built in 1961 to 
keep the two berlins apart thousands of east and west berliners 
reunited in an outpouring of joy that lasted well into this morning 
hordes of east berliners poured across the berlin wall crossing 
in their tiny trabant cars on foot or on packed subways 
madness madness cried a 44yearold east berlin woman who 
gave her name as inge to think that im seeing all this after 28 
years 
she and her husband werner were already in their nightclothes 
when they heard the border was open 
we were up and dressed with our son in a second her husband 
said but even we couldnt get across in the car there were so 
many people so we just left it there and pushed our way across 
at the invalidenstrasse crossing to east berlin police appealed 
frantically to the crowd to clear the path for hundreds of east 
berliners crossing to raucous cheers from the westerers 
this is a historic day and because it is such a historic 
moment we ask you to keep the crossing clear a policeman 
repeatedly told the crowd 
few listened 
we were here when the wall went up in 1961 beamed west 
berliner helga zuballa 53 were so happy if it keeps on like 
this well have nothing left to wish for 
champagne corks popped and some west berlin bars the only 
ones in germany which never close offered free beer to the 
arriving hordes of east berliners other west germans offered money 
to the newcomers 
west berlin authorities ordered city subways to run all night to 
cope with the unprecedented mass of people moving around in the 
city 
i promised him id take him across if they opened up the 
border said uwe scheiderat as he and his 17yearold son erich 
gazed in wonder at the electronics on show in a display window on 
the kurfuerstendamm one of europes most elegant shopping streets 
hundreds of west berliners took a journey themselves heading in 
the opposite direction to catch a glimpse of the east 
for the first time in my life i had tears in my eyes when i 
listened to the tv news said peter huber one of thousands of 
west berliners who flooded toward the invalidenstrasse crossing 
what joy this is the best thing that happened in 100 years 
yelled another west berlin man 
its crazy its crazy shouted a young man from the back 
seat of a car 
in the delirium few seemed to notice that east german radio had 
announced visafree entrances would stop this morning 
in east berlin however hundreds of people jammed the house of 
travel on the alexanderplatz already lining up for visas that 
would allow them to cross today

the united mine workers and the pittston 
co will begin intensive bargaining next week in an effort to 
resolve the 7monthold strike against the coal company the 
governments supermediator says 
im absolutely convinced that both sides want a contract 
mediator wj usery said thursday after he hosted the first 
facetoface negotiating session involving umw president richard 
trumka and pittston chairman paul douglas 
usery and other participants said the 75minute session was 
largely spent setting ground rules for the negotiations but 
included a brief discussion of the broad issues in the strike 
which has idled 1700 miners in virginia west virginia and 
kentucky since april 
we werent dealing with substance said trumka 
among the rules said usery was an agreement that specifics of 
the negotiations to begin monday will not be disclosed to the media 
we dont want to mediate in the press the former labor 
secretary and veteran mediator told reporters usery said 
negotiations would go on day and night if necessary and he held 
out hope the bitter and sometimes violent strike could be over by 
thanksgiving 
the biggest issue in the dispute is over pittstons payments of 
health and retirement benefits a fight whose outcome could have 
farreaching effects in the coal industry 
the company withdrew from a national compact among coal 
producers that guarantees retired miners health and pension 
benefits the union believes that if pittston is successful in 
trimming those benefits other companies will attempt to do so 
usery said he did not ask trumka and douglas to attend mondays 
session and would not request their presence unless he believed an 
agreement was within reach 
douglas pledged his support for the mediation saying he would 
do whatever i can do to help with the process he also praised 
for usery saying he was very impressed with the man labor 
secretary elizabeth dole tapped two weeks ago in hopes of resolving 
the strike 
trumka said if anyone can get this job done i think bill 
usery can

the flight of tens of thousands to the west and 
the stunning growth of a popular revolt has overwhelmed east 
germanys communist leadership and forced reforms at a breathtaking 
pace 
the tempo of change has been much faster in east germany than in 
the soviet union poland or hungary events have spun out of 
control since east germany the communist child of the cold war 
celebrated its 40th birthday just a month ago with 77yearold 
leader erich honecker heading the celebration 
but the party was spoiled by images of east germans fleeing to 
the west through hungary czechoslovakia and poland now honecker 
builder of the berlin wall in 1961 is gone along with most of 
his aging comrades 
what was left of the communist party politburo resigned en masse 
on wednesday and the new leader egon krenz tried to put together 
a leadership that could retain the political supremacy of a 
discredited party 
he promised free elections and then on thursday politburo 
member guenter schabowski announced the opening of his countrys 
borders unleasing the once unthinkable flight of thousands through 
crossings in the berlin wall 
as mikhail s gorbachev decreed reform in the soviet union he 
also set loose reform movements across the soviet bloc at home he 
allowed freer elections a more open press and formation of 
legislative bodies that partly reflected popular will 
in a decade of struggle poland managed to come to terms with an 
opposition that rallied around solidarity to form the east blocs 
first noncommunist government hungary moved slowly but surely 
toward demoractic reform 
east germany seemed firmly embedded in the old ways its 
leadership wary of change 
then east germans started leaving in a swelling flood that has 
reached nearly 200000 people 
even worse for the east german leadership they were leaving 
through friendly countries hungary poland and czechoslovakia 
especially after hungary began dismantling fortifications along its 
border with austria may 2 
no other east european state has undergone such staggering mass 
departures the exodus caught the east german leadership by 
surprise 
honecker reportedly ailing and probably not in full control 
during those crucial summer weeks then compounded the problem by 
mishandling the exit of east german refugees from the west german 
embassy in prague 
on the night of oct 34 thousands of east germans stormed 
dresden station trying to get on the special trains taking the 
prague refugees west on a bizarre journey back through their 
communist homeland 
riot police beat back the crowds and battled others on the 
streets of east berlin days later when they tried to march for 
reform during the 40th birthday celebrations 
the next day anger at the police and a mixture of shock and 
hopelessness caused 100000 people to take over the streets of 
leipzig to demand free elections 
im leaving because of what i saw on the night of oct 34 
said a leipzig worker caught in the dresden station battle by 
chance 
another factor in the swiftness of the revolt in east germany 
was that the government didnt seem to know what to do it could 
not stop the protests or the flight of east germans and could not 
prevent hungary and czechoslovakia from letting east germans cross 
the borders 
at the czechoslovakwest german border this week not every east 
german was fleeing some had simply driven friends to the threshold 
of freedom before returning home 
got to go back and keep on demonstrating smiled a man in 
his early 40s from erfurt clenching a fist in the air

with violence escalating in el salvador 
congressional negotiators on a 144 billion foreign aid bill are 
providing up to 85 million in military aid to the countrys new 
rightist government 
the house and senate conferees who completed work on the 
measure late thursday also agreed to 12 million for police 
training to the government of president alfredo cristiani 
but the police training aid was included only after lawmakers 
added a requirement that president bush report to congress on the 
investigation into the deadly oct 31 bombing of the headquarters 
of a leading antigovernment union 
cristiani of the rightwing arena party took office in june 
talks he initiated with the leftist fmln guerillas fighting his 
government failed and violence on both sides of the 10yearold 
civil war has escalated in recent weeks 
final agreement on the overall aid package by the conferees sent 
it back to the house and senate floors for final approval 
the agreement also increased the likelihood legislation carrying 
substantial aid for polands new solidarityled government could be 
approved in time for next weeks scheduled speech to congress by 
party leader lech walesa 
the bill includes 533 million in aid to poland and hungary two 
eastern european countries that have been on the leading edge of 
political and economic reform in the warsaw pact 
it also included 15 million in aid to the united nations 
population fund which would reverse a fiveyear policy of not 
funding agencies that carry on programs in china which has a 
policy that leads to forced abortions and sterilizations 
president bush has vowed to veto the bill if it includes that 
provision but it was considered likely to be removed when the 
measure goes back to the house 
the bill also contained another veto target a provision barring 
the united states from using foreign aid money to entice any 
foreign government to carry out any policy that would violate us 
law the provision grew out of the irancontra affair when 
honduras was rewarded with expedited aid for its support of the 
nicaraguan contra rebels 
in other provisions the bill 
extended authority of the exportimport bank to subsidize sales 
of usmade defense items to turkey and greece the provision 
pushed by sen christopher dodd dconn was designed to 
facilitate a sale of sikorsky helicopters to turkey overall exim 
funding was pegged at 615 million 
earmarked 35 million for the american schools and hospitals 
abroad program the same as last year the program has come under 
fire as a foreign aid pork barrel that funds pet projects 
overseas of members of congress 
set aside 20 million in economic aid and 43 million in 
military aid for morocco which lobbies on capitol hill but killed 
similar aid for tunisia portugal malawi and central america 
provided 50 million as the us contribution to the world 
bank but effectively froze the money until congress is satisfied 
that us commercial banks have made adequate concessions to write 
down thirdworld loans 
redistributed the 23000 metric ton sugar sales quota forfeited 
by panama under us sanctions to caribbean nations and bolivia 
the measure included 47 billion overall in military aid and 
32 billion in economic aid the largest recipients of us 
largesse are israel and egypt which receive money as rewards for 
participating in the camp david middle east peace process

the oscar statuette one of the most 
recognizable images in the entertainment world has no copyright 
protection a federal judge has ruled 
the small academy award statue is part of the public domain 
us district court judge laughlin waters said in a ruling released 
thursday 
the decision was a setback for the academy of motion picture 
arts and sciences which had sued a chicagobased manufacturer of 
an employeeincentive trophy similar to the oscar 
academy president karl malden said the ruling comes as a shock 
to me the academy said it would appeal 
the academy claimed that the star award the trophy lookalike 
made by creative house promotions violated copyright laws diluted 
the academys trademark and represented unfair competition 
the star award depicted a naked muscular male much like the 
oscar just two inches shorter and holding a star instead of a 
sword it had a gold finish similar to the oscar and stood on a 
circular gold cap mounted on a cylindrical base 
although waters acknowledged that the creative house trophy is 
very similar to the oscar he rejected all of the academys 
legal claims saying that the statuette became part of the public 
domain prior to jan 1 1978 the effective date of the copyright 
act of 1976 
the film industrys top award was distributed from the first 
ceremony in 1929 until about 1941 without the c mark indicating 
a copyright 
the judge ruled too that the oscar not only was an honorary 
award but also was used to promote the film industry and therefore 
did not have a limited purpose as required by the copyright 
act 
the academy noted that the ruling applied only to the statuette 
and that the academys trademark and service marks for the oscar 
and the academy award names and symbols are unaffected 
we are surprised that the court would base its decision on 
events which occurred half a century ago overlooking the 
meticulous fashion in which the academy has protected the integrity 
of its institutional symbol for decades malden said in a 
statement

lawmakers are complaining that the 
houseapproved 305 billion defense bill is a weak response to 
major political changes worldwide and amounts to nothing more than 
a jobs program 
the warsaw pact is crumbling before our eyes and were 
building weapons of destruction said rep ronald dellums 
dcalif a member of the house armed services committee and a 
longtime opponent of military buildup 
although both proponents and opponents criticized the defense 
bill a compromise package worked out by house and senate 
conferees after nearly two months of contentious negotiations the 
house on thursday adopted the legislation 236172 
the bill which goes to the senate slashes 11 billion from 
president bushs request for the strategic defense initiative but 
provides much of the money for two landbased nuclear missiles and 
the b2 stealth bomber 
the legislation also continues two programs bush sought to kill 
the navys f14d tomcat jet fighter and the ahip helicopter for 
one more year and postpones a decision on the marine corps v22 
osprey and the phoenix missile 
the osprey the tiltrotor aircraft that takes off like a 
helicopter but can fly like a plane will receive about 255 
million in research and development money in fiscal 1990 but no 
funds for procurement 
the legislation includes money for 18 f14d jet fighters but 
requires the manufacturer grumman corp to sign a termination 
agreement ending all future production 
salvaging weapons programs and jobs in many districts drew 
the ire of a number of lawmakers 
the defense pork bill passed the congress today congress made 
no hard choices said rep john kasich rohio a member of the 
house armed services committee the relationship between national 
security and the defense authorization bill is just about 
coincidental 
the complaints came as east germany opened the berlin wall and 
its other borders thursday and allowed citizens to cross freely to 
the west for the first time in 28 years 
peace is breaking out and were going to have four legs of the 
triad instead of three said rep patricia schroeder dcolo a 
member of the armed services panel 
another committee member rep larry hopkins rky said the 
winds of change are sweeping across every part of our world we 
have an opportunity to set a course to take this nation forward 
instead hopkins said congress was corrupted by parochial 
avarice 
the defense budget according to dellums continues to pursue 
the same tired old path of no change military expansion more and 
more brandnew conventional and nuclear weapons systems at a time 
when the world is crying out for change and the world is crying out 
for peace 
among the legislations provisions are 43 billion for the b2 
430 million less than the administration requested for the fiscal 
year that began oct 1 the bill provides money for two bombers in 
fiscal 1990 one less than the administration sought however the 
legislation accepts bushs proposal for components for five bombers 
in fiscal 1991 
the bill provides 38 billion for sdi also known as star wars 
about 279 million less than was spent in fiscal 1989 and the 
first decrease since president reagan proposed the antimissile 
shield six years ago bush had sought 49 billion for the program 
approximately 11 billion is included for two landbased 
nuclear missiles the multiplewarhead railgarrison mx and the 
singlewarhead truckbased midgetman the bill trims about 150 
million from the administrations request for the two weapons and 
adds house language imposing a 50missile cap on the mx 
also thursday house and senate negotiators reached agreement on 
a 288 billion military spending bill for fiscal 1990 that largely 
tracks the defense authorization bill on the major strategic 
weapons said lawmakers and congressional sources who requested 
anonymity

an outbreak of gonorrhea among homosexual men in 
seattle could signal a risky relapse from aidsprompted safe 
sex practices among homosexual men health officials warned 
researchers with the national centers for disease control said 
thursday that a study reported 79 gonorrhea cases in the first 10 
months of this year at a public health clinic in seattle if the 
rate continued the clinic would report about 100 cases this year 
compared with 27 last year 
the surprising increase follows a 96 percent decline in 
gonorrhea cases at the clinic over the previous six years 
widespread publicity about the spread of the deadly disease 
among homosexuals has led to changes over the last decade in the 
sexual practices of many homosexual men who previously may have had 
many partners gonorrhea like aids is sexually transmitted 
the latest increase might be an isolated occurrence among 
homosexuals who have continued to practice unsafe sex the cdc said 
in its weekly report but the outbreak could mean that eight years 
after the discovery of aids some homosexually active men may 
have relaxed behaviors regarding sexual safety 
these really profound changes celibacy monogamy may be 
remarkably difficult more difficult to maintain as time passes 
said william whittington a cdc specialist in sexually transmitted 
diseases if this is indeed true we in this business may need to 
look at things we can try to help people sustain these kinds of 
changes over time 
the notion of a risky sexual relapse was put forth in june 
at an aids conference in montreal as researchers said they had 
seen signs of riskier sexual behavior among homosexuals in san 
francisco 
the new findings came from the seattleking county department of 
public health std clinic where patients are classified on the 
basis of sexual orientation 
the decadelong decline of gonorrhea in homosexual and bisexual 
men has been attributed to concern over the spread of aids which 
was first reported in 1981 
about 589000 gonorrhea cases have been reported nationwide thus 
far this year down from an average of 713000 at this point in the 
five preceding years 
aids or acquired immune deficiency syndrome destroys the 
bodys defenses against disease exposing the victim to 
lifethreatening infections and cancers 
the virus that causes the incurable and fatal disease is 
believed to be passed mainly through sexual intercourse shared 
hypodermic needles and from infected mothers to their infants 
before or during birth

navy pilots accidentally dropped hundreds of 
bombs for years outside a military bombing range in central nevada 
and state officials are angry they never were told about it 
navy officials in a sweep that began oct 30 and should be 
completed by midnovember have found some bombs on public lands 
used by hunters hikers and offroadvehicle enthusiasts 
the navy has recovered up to 2000 live and dead bombs dropped 
outside the 22000acre bombing range at fallon naval air station 
im just appalled this has occurred gov bob miller said 
thursday 
he called it the latest in a string of broken promises from 
the navy 
there is absolutely no reason why we cannot expect them to 
stay within the boundaries that were given them miller said 
miller ordered the closure of state route 839 an 18mile road 
that parallels navy bombing areas starting 60 miles east of reno 
he also said the bureau of land management agreed to his request 
to close 35000 acres of public land surrounding the ranges until 
the navy completes its cleanup 
citizen alert called for an indefinite halt to bombing at fallon 
pending an investigation into why the bombs were allowed to fall 
outside the 22000acre range for years without public knowlege 
this is something they should have notified the public about a 
long time ago said bob fulkerson executive director of the 
renobased environmental group 
capt rex rackowitz fallons commanding officer said the 
search and cleanup operation codenamed operation ugly baby is a 
routine exercise to ensure peoples safety the public wasnt 
informed of the effort to keep away onlookers he said 
some of the ordnance is so dangerous is must be detonated on 
site 
some explosives were found a mile or so outside the military 
ranges and some appeared to have been there for up to 30 years 
and the navy has done nothing in that time the governor said 
miller told military officials he was concerned some people 
might take live ammunition on public lands as souvenirs

a popular tv game show host who appeared 
tied for the lead in brazils presidential race lost his chance 
when an electoral court ruled he violated election guidelines and 
could not be on the ballot 
the decision thursday by the supreme electoral tribunal ended 
the nineday candidacy of silvio santos whose late entry into the 
race rocked brazils first free presidential vote since 1960 
it came the same day a gallup poll was published showing santos 
virtually tied for the lead with centerrightist candidate fernando 
collor de mello the poll showed santos had 216 percent of the 
vote 
news reports speculated that president jose sarney engineered 
santos entry into the race to undermine collor de mello who has 
tried to distance himself from the highly unpopular government and 
create an image as a fighter of corruption 
sarney who is not a candidate in the wednesdays election 
denied it 
all seven members of the electoral court ruled santos was 
ineligible to run because he violated a 1970 election law requiring 
each candidate to leave the directorship of a governmentlicensed 
business such as tv stations and networks three months before 
the election 
santos lawyers contended he merely owned controlling stock in 
the sbt television network but the court decided santos actively 
ran the nations secondlargest network 
the court also unanimously ruled santos tiny municipalist party 
did not fulfill election registration guidelines requiring at least 
nine state conventions and declared the tiny party defunct 
santos can appeal the decision to the supreme court said the 
court president jose francisco rezek 
santos 58 refused comment on the ruling thursday night 
mr santos told me to tell all of you reporters that he had a 
headache and went to bed said his maid narilia lopes 
the tv entertainer who is popular among brazils poor had been 
widely criticized by other presidential candidates since he 
declared his candidacy 
santos born senor abravanel of greek immigrant parents rose 
from selling wallets on streetcorners 35 years ago to become a 
multimillionaire executive and owner of more than 30 businesses 
most candidates welcomed the courts decision 
santos campaign was doomed from the start said luis inacio 
lula da silva of the marxistoriented workers party 
now the campaign can get back to normal said sen mario 
covas of the leftofcenter brazilian social democracy party now 
all of those votes will come back to the true candidates of the 
campaign 
leonel brizola of the leftofcenter democratic labor party 
said those who backed santos benefited from the dictatorship and 
dont want to lose their accumulated privileges 
he was referring to brazils military rule that began in 1964 
and lasted until sarney a poet became president in 1985

the army says it has grounded its fleet of 
ah64 apache attack helicopters after a flaw was found on two 
of the gunships during maintenance inspections 
the army said in a statement released at the pentagon thursday 
that it was grounding the 526 choppers as a precautionary measure 
because a cracked retention nut was found on the two helicopters 
the grounding the fourth of the apache fleet was expected to last 
a few days 
the apache is the armys newest and most sophisticated 
helicopter gunship 
army spokesman maj barry bomier said no accidents had been 
reported because of the problem 
the fleet based throughout the united states and europe was 
grounded twice in 1986 and once earlier this year after an accident 
in which a piece of sheet metal struck a gunships rotor blade 
the grounding will remain in effect until an analysis of the 
part is completed at the us army aviation systems command in st 
louis mo the analysis should result in information to identify 
the proper procedure for maintenance crews to follow bomier said 
the part known as the main rotor hub retention nut holds the 
rotor onto the shaft of the aircraft bomier said

the government says thousands of 22caliber 
semiautomatic pistols called scorpions which may switch without 
warning to an automatic function are being recalled by the 
manufacturer under an agreement reached with federal authorities 
a flawed part used in the manufacture of the scorpion 22 
semiautomatic pistol may cause the gun to malfunction including 
turning the semiautomatic into an automatic bureau of alcohol 
tobacco and firearms director stephen e higgins said in a 
statement released thursday 
in a semiautomatic weapon a separate pull of the trigger is 
required for each shot in an automatic weapon one pull of the 
trigger can dispatch numerous shots congress in 1986 banned sales 
of automatic weapons made on or after may 15 1986 to all 
purchasers the armed services and law enforcement agencies 
the scorpion is manufactured by intratec usa a miamibased 
firearms firm according to atf spokesman jack killorin 
the company says it has sold about 20000 of the guns and has an 
additional 27000 in a warehouse the atf will supervise the recall

a congresswoman is questioning the navys 
decision to make the skipper of the uss iowa eligible for another 
major command in light of inquiries into the battleship blast that 
killed 47 sailors 
rep mary rose oakar dohio said thursday that she was asking 
navy secretary lawrence garrett iii to explain the alleged 
selection of capt fred p moosally for sequential major command 
the navy investigation concluded that gunners mate clayton 
hartwig of ohio most likely caused the april 19 explosion by 
inserting some type of detonator between bags of gunpowder in one 
of the ships 16inch guns 
members of congress hartwigs family and shipmates have 
criticized the report oakar has asked the general accounting 
office the investigative arm of congress to review the navys 
findings 
the navy screening board that took the action on moosally 
includes rear adm richard milligan who headed the services 
investigation into the explosion oakar said 
i realize that consideration and possible selection of capt 
moosally does not commit the navy to consider him for sequential 
major command but i question the propriety of such action while 
there are several congressional and navy investigations ongoing 
oakar said

a7 corsair attack jets like the one that 
exploded in air and crashed into an apartment complex thursday 
night have been part of the us arsenal since 1965 
the subsonic singleengine aircraft has been used for a variety 
of bombing missions on land and at sea and was part of the 
american air armada in the vietnam war 
the singleseat a7e the version of the aircraft that went down 
in this north atlanta suburb has a 20mm gun and can carry up to 
15000 pounds of bombs and missiles it was built by ltv corp 
the first version of the corsair the a7a made its initial 
flight on sept 27 1965 according to janes all the worlds 
aircraft it has been extensively modernized over the years 
particularly in the areas of flight control navigation and 
targeting equipment 
corsair iis were part of the twocarrier battle group that 
conducted a strike on libyan terroristrelated targets in 1986 
a7es and fa18s used antiradar missiles to neutralize air 
defenses 
the airplane has also been used by the greek and portuguese air 
forces 
two years ago a crippled a7d corsair slammed into the lobby of 
the ramada innairport in indianapolis killing 10 people 
the air force fighter was making an aborted emergency landing 
attempt on oct 20 1987 when it crashed into the hotel 1 miles 
from the runway moments after the pilot ejected 
maintenance records show that the a7d had numerous oil system 
problems in the month before the 1987 crash the plane had been 
brought in twice for deadstick landings when its engine shut down 
in midair 
pilots who were interviewed after that crash said the plane is 
noted for its bombing accuracy but also for unfortunate 
aerodynamics 
its not an easy plane to fly one navy pilot said at the 
time its underpowered to begin with and if you lose the engine 
theres not much glide left in the old bird 
this is a seat bolted to a jet engine and without power 
youve got the aerodynamics of a rock we used to joke that if you 
got in trouble youd drop three feet for every foot you moved 
forward 
ltv no longer produces the plane but the company received a 
contract from the air force in 1987 to rebuild two a7s into a7 
plus aircraft that would incorporate a stretched fuselage a new 
engine that would give it supersonic capability and aerodynamic 
improvements 
the air force would ultimately like to rebuild many of its a7s 
to the new plus configuration extending the planes life into the 
next century

the state board of education upheld the dismissal 
of an awardwinning teacher even though she was acquitted of 
charges stemming from the discovery of marijuana growing on 
property she shared with her husband 
the board said vicki sherlings immorality could be inferred 
without proof of criminal purpose or intent 
the state board voted 43 thursday to uphold colquitt countys 
decision not to reinstate mrs sherling who was fired in may the 
local board contended there was sufficient evidence to conclude 
that mrs sherling at least knew her husband had possessed 
marijuana 
mrs sherling who was named 1989 teacher of the year in the 
south georgia county was arrested with her husband michael after 
marijuana plants were found in a makeshift greenhouse in their back 
yard in may 
a test detected no trace of marijuana in her blood and her 
husband who was sentenced to three years prison after pleading 
guilty to possessing and manufacturing marijuana testified that 
mrs sherling had no knowledge of the plants 
attorney william norwood said mrs sherling will file a lawsuit 
in colquitt county to appeal the state boards decision and he may 
file a federal case charging civil rights violations he did not 
elaborate 
the boards action does not revoke mrs sherlings teaching 
certificate and she remains eligible to teach in any georgia 
district that will hire her 
the georgia association of educators backed mrs sherling 
paying legal fees for her appeal

the heiress of a margarine fortune and her 
colombian codefendant were convicted of cocaine distribution and 
conspiracy and face a maximum sentence of life in prison 
prosecutors said sandra filbert amos the granddaughter of the 
founder of mrs filberts margarine helped her livein boyfriend 
set up the drug ring because she loved him and wanted to overcome 
his feeling that the disparity in their incomes harmed their 
relationship 
sentencing ironically was sent for valentines day feb 14 
she cut a pretty sympathetic figure with the jury 
prosecutor breckenridge willcox said shes young shes 
attractive shes an heiress if you will so this was not someone 
we assumed we were going to have a slamdunk case on 
also convicted thursday was guillermo moran a colombian living 
in new york city amos boyfriend jeremiah dennis case had 
already pleaded guilty to drug charges and is awaiting sentencing 
amos and moran each were convicted of two counts of distribution 
of cocaine and one count of conspiracy to distribute more than five 
kilograms of cocaine 
amos 35 who inherited 2 million of the mrs filberts 
fortune was accused of participating in a distribution ring that 
operated out of her home on marylands eastern shore 
defense attorney russell white argued that amos was guilty only 
of cocaine possession spending as much as 2000 a week to support 
her drug habit 
the conspiracy charge carries a minimum sentence of 10 years 
but prosecutor lisa griffin said the sentence could be lightened 
depending on amos knowledge of the size of the distribution ring

aquinos meeting thursday in washington with president bush 
president aquinos meeting with bush is a sign of her 
treacherous selling of her countrys sovereignty in exchange for 
the bases said philip hernandez a union official who spoke at 
the manila rally 
police initially stood by as about 100 militant workers 
protested in front of the embassy to demand the six us bases be 
closed

students arrived to join the protest police arrested student 
leader nathaniel santiago

law officers wearing moon suits today 
finished a weeklong job of sifting through warehouse barrels 
filled with dangerous chemicals and cocaine that authorities say is 
worth more than 850 million 
the delicate operation involving federal agents local police 
and even the american red cross unfolded in an unlikely setting a 
quiet block in the new york city borough of queens that includes 
warehouses tenements and humble houses with a view of the empire 
state building across the east river 
its an oldfashioned neighborhood most of the residents are 
hardworking bluecollar or middleclass people said resident 
john osullivan at a nearby coffee shop drugs are not within our 
vernacular 
but in a raid on a threestory warehouse last friday drug 
agents found cocaine 
on top of the cocaine packages in the sealed drums were six 
inches of a powdery substance which police soon learned contained 
a 98 percent concentration of sodium hydroxide a chemical used in 
lye that can eat through concrete in comparison said lt doug 
reed of the police departments hazardous materials unit drain 
cleaner has about a 4 percent concentration of sodium hydroxide 
known as caustic soda 
the authorities finished recovering the cocaine this morning 
cataloguing 10648 pounds of the drug said rick mercier a us 
customs special agent police and customs officials estimate the 
cocaines street value at 80000 a pound 
it could be the largest seizure to date in new york and one of 
the five largest cocaine seizures in the nations history 
according to dea spokeswoman mary cooper 
the investigation begun by us customs soon included federal 
drug agents city police county police and emergency medical 
squads the red cross fed 80 workers on wednesday night alone 
police working inside the warehouse wore oxygen masks 40pound 
tanks and protective suits the sleeves sealed with tape to two 
pairs of gloves the gloves were changed when the chemicals ate 
through them about twice an hour 
the teams worked aroundtheclock on the painstaking process of 
opening the drums decontaminating repackaging removing the 
cocaine except on sunday when new york marathon runners streamed 
right past the cordonedoff warehouse 
as it was decontaminated the cocaine was placed in a 
semitrailer truck eventually the truckload will be driven to an 
incinerator at an undisclosed location 
mercier said the cocaine could be tainted despite the plastic 
that surrounded it in the drum it wasnt clear whether any had 
made it onto the streets 
sodium hydroxide can irritate the skin and respiratory tract and 
cause blindness the damage is compounded when its smoked or 
injected 
investigators were searching for five suspects believed linked 
to the cali drug cartel the new york times reported that police 
were searching for juan martinez head of a company called the 
aranal corp which rented the warehouse 
in a simultaneous raid last friday agents found thousands of 
drums of sodium hydroxide in a philadelphia warehouse leased by 
aranal corp mercier said he had no immediate word of cocaine in 
the drums there

the dollar steadied in european trading today 
while traders debated the impact of east germanys decision to 
permit free travel for its citizens 
gold was slightly lower in quiet trading 
the immediate impact of german developments said peter kane 
chief corporate dealer at credit suisse in london was to create 
uncertainty about the consequences for the west german economy and 
thus undermine the deutsche mark 
where there is uncertainty there tends to be weakness kane 
said 
analysts said a flood of east germans into west germany would 
have a mixed impact raising unemployment but perhaps easing 
pressure on inflation as new arrivals accept lower wages 
it may take months or years for problems to show through 
said chris furness of hill samuel amp co ltd in london what 
still is unclear is if any other of the major countries is going to 
do any better

the prosecutor deputy district attorney william hodgman said 
he was surprised and disappointed by the acquittals and mistrial 
he said the district attorneys office likely will decide next week 
whether to retry bridges on the assault charge 
juror maxine hall said it was a sloppy case and that bridges 
never should have been charged with attempted murder there was 
no problem finding him not guilty of attempted murder at all 
the prosecution had argued that bridges shot clay eight times at 
close range in a dispute over the actors bmw automobile 
clay denied he had stolen the car in his testimony during 
bridges preliminary hearing but reversed himself during the trial 
cochran characterized bridges as a babe in the woods out of 
his element in the mean streets of south central los angeles and 
said the actor had fired in selfdefense

china has poured an additional 11 billion into 
moneylosing state factories it was reported today a blow to the 
governments attempt to balance the budget 
the latest loan to large industrial enterprises reported by the 
official china daily today was also more bad news for citizens who 
are being forced to buy voluntary debt bonds to pay for 
government subsidy programs 
the daily said the industrial and commercial bank of china 
which recently gave out 14 billion in loans to faltering 
government enterprises was providing the additional credit to 
carry them through current difficulties 
it said 378 million more had been set aside as credit funds for 
enterprises having cash problems due to a government austerity 
policy that has restricted money supply 
the daily said the latest funding was believed to be part of a 
more sizeable loan if so it would appear the government has begun 
to cave in on a tough fiscal policy out of fears of plant 
shutdowns rising unemployment and recession 
on thursday the communist party central committee outlined a 
plan committing the nation to at least two more years of economic 
retrenchment and called for the gradual achievement of a balanced 
budget 
hardline communists led by premier li peng face the dilemma of 
supporting an inefficient governmentrun system that makes fiscal 
solvency an impossibility 
about a quarter of government industries topheavy with workers 
and shackled by planning demands are money losers and the central 
government is believed to pay out about 108 billion a year in 
subsidies to keep them going 
the finance ministry has put chinas budget deficit at about 
22 billion but western economists say it could be as much as four 
times that amount if foreign loans and the issuance of treasury 
bonds were included

hundreds of east germans converged on checkpoint 
charlie today to cross through the berlin wall to the west for the 
first time in their lives 
tens of thousands more virtually stormed police stations across 
the country to get the visas that will take them west but west 
german news media quoted some travelers as saying they found that 
formal visas werent even necessary to join the wave of visitors to 
the west 
cant take it in muttered helmut imhof as he stood in line 
at checkpoint charlie for a visa that would take him to west berlin 
through the weekend communist authorities on thursday began 
allowing citizens to travel freely to the west for the first time 
since the wall was erected in 1961 
ive worked right here next to the wall for 20 years imhof

just unbelievable

workers still wearing their work overalls and hard hats drank beer 
and toasted their first experience of west berlin watched by about 
200 curious westerners and immortalized by a host of photographers 
back in the east more hardhatted workers filled out the 
uncomplicated forms that guaranteed them a brief visit to west 
berlin 
everybody wanted to go so we decided to do it in shifts 
said a young worker who declined to give his name but were 
still fulfilling our quota of work he assured a reporter 
the crowd waiting to go across included three soviets who said 
they missed the chance to go through thursday when the news broke 
but we must try now just to see it once said a russian 
worker who said he lived in east berlin but declined to give his 
name 
rene a 20yearold factory worker who declined to give his last 
name was one of the uncounted tens of thousands who surged across 
to west berlin without waiting for the official visa on thursday 
night 
i think its simply great he said on east berlins 
leipziger strasse this morning just after getting the stamp that 
will allow him unlimited trips to west berlin for six months 
i was over there for an hour last night he said i didnt 
see much it was dark but the way the people greeted us that was 
wonderful and i saw enough to know that its something quite 
different over there its a onceinalifetime feeling 
at one east berlin police station about 3000 people were 
waiting for the new visas by the time the police station opened at 
8 am witnesses reported 
police stations were ordered to remain open through the weekend

at the checkpoint charlie the famed spot where east and west 
have exchanged spies for nearly three decades as well as the 
invalidenstrasse and bornholmer strasse crossings into west berlin 
people were being waved through after simply filling out a form for 
a oneday visit some didnt even have to do that 
neither west berlin nor east berlin authorities had any real 
idea of how many tens of thousands of east berliners into west 
berlin thursday night and early today in a delirious spontaneous 
outburst of joy however the sender freies berlin radio station 
estimated the number at more than 50000

deng xiaoping met former us secretary of state 
henry kissinger among the official trappings of the great hall of 
the people today a day after he announced his retirement from his 
last party post 
deng on thursday gave up his last official job as chairman of 
the communist partys central military commission 
the 85yearold deng today noted with a hearty laugh that 
kissinger was the first foreign guest he had met since retirement 
but he said he will continue to play his dual role as citizen 
and party member 
the meeting at beijings great hall the seat of government 
reinforced the general feeling that deng will remain dominant 
though he no longer holds official titles 
after deng made reference to his retirement kissinger said 
you will never be without great influence 
are you opposed to it deng asked 
i am for it kissinger said 
deng commented that kissinger is no longer secretary of state 
yet you are still busy working in international affairs 
kissinger is making what is believed to be his 15th trip to 
china since a secret visit in 1971 that set the stage for 
normalization of relations with the united states 
deng referred to his advanced age and his stutter but said he 
was quite healthy adding my mind is quite clear 
he was replaced on the military body by jiang zemin communist 
party chief 
former communist party chief zhao ziyang continued to be 
pilloried in the official press even while a justconcluded party 
meeting refrained from further attacks on the oncepowerful

month 
zhao believed to be under house arrest has been under constant 
attack since then and there has been speculation he might face 
criminal charges 
however the party central committee in a communique issued

a disgruntled house republican from south 
carolina is going to get a seat on the merchant marine and 
fisheries committee after saying he could just as easily be a 
democrat 
rep arthur ravenel of south carolina insisted he had not 
actually threatened to bolt his party but gop chairman lee atwater 
and house republican leaders got him on the panel anyway 
house republican leaders bob michel of illinois and newt 
gingrich of georgia after consulting with atwater hurriedly 
arranged ravenels appointment thursday 
the behindthescenes jockeying took place after the state 
newspaper in columbia sc quoted unidentified sources as saying 
ravenel felt out of step with his party and was considering 
crossing over to the democrats 
but what had been irking ravenel was his inability to get on the 
committee he called extremely important to the health and wealth 
of the 1st congressional district of south carolina 
atwater is a native of south carolina and congressional sources 
said ravenels defection could have proved embarrassing to him gop 
spokeswoman leslie goodman said the party chairman discussed the 
problem at breakfast thursday with ravenel and gingrich 
atwater who has known ravenel since he was a volunteer for 
ravenels mayoral candidacy in charleston in 1970 said he spoke 
with gingrich and michel about the seat for ravenel 
it was those two who lobbied and got the votes on the 
committee said atwater adding it makes sense to have a 
congressman from the coastal city of charleston on the committee 
earlier thursday ravenel had dismissed speculation in his home 
state that he was prepared to leave the gop 
if i was going to switch parties i would hold a press 
conference and i would tell the people at home i was switching 
parties and why the lawmaker said i wouldnt make a switch 
unless i had a compelling reason 
in an interview earlier this week ravenel said he had been 
criticized by conservatives in south carolina for his recent 
support of funding for abortion in cases of incest or rape and for 
backing some spending measures 
im just not a rightwinger im a moderate and it just 
drives some of the republicans back home up the wall ravenel was 
quoted as saying i could just as easily be a democrat as a 
republican 
but ravenel said thursday those comments were nothing new and 
thats a lot of old stuff ive been saying for a long time 
michel and gingrich had to lobby rep don young of alaska the 
senior republican on the merchant marine and fisheries committee 
to remove his objections to ravenels joining the panel 
ravenel had said young was blocking his appointment because he 
opposed youngs stance in favor of opening the alaska national 
wildlife refuge to oil exploration 
cj zane youngs administrative assistant confirmed that 
young fought ravenels appointment because ravenel refused to 
pledge to support youngs position on the alaska national wildlife 
refuge issue 
zane said young went along with the requests of the party 
leadership to seat ravenel out of concern for party unity 
there was a big push from michel and other republicans 
including atwater because they didnt want to deal with losing a 
guy to another party at this time the aide said

only in a broadway musical can you spend the 
night in new yorks central park and survive to sing and dance not 
only sing and dance but build a home in this case a tree house 
complete with dinnerware stolen from tavern on the green 
prince of central park is a new york fairy tale told with a 
modest amount of musical imagination and wit the show which 
opened thursday at broadways belasco theater is a small musical 
in almost every respect its not awful but its mildness and 
meager musical numbers make it a dim prospect to last very long on 
broadway 
the story adapted by evan h rhodes is based on rhodes 
successful novel and a wellreceived television special a 
middleaged woman facing divorce meets a young runaway in central 
park shes escaping from an unsatisfying marriage hes fleeing a 
brutal life as a foster child before the musical is over they 
unsurprisingly have forged a new family 
the new york conjured up by rhodes composer don sebesky and 
lyricist gloria nissenson is a remarkably tame city despite the 
references to drugs and crime at times their vision of gotham 
seems like bargain basement comden and green its a city where 
police officers tap dance bag ladies are lovable sales clerks ask 
if they can help you and muggers look like refugees from an mtv 
video 
what makes the musical tolerable is the personalities of its two 
stars jo anne worley who plays the woman and richard h blake as 
the boy worley is what used to be known as a trouper a 
vanishing breed on broadway today no matter how unhummable the 
music or insipid the lyrics or book she carries on worley charges 
through the show as if she believes every note and word she is 
having fun and insists the audience do so too 
blake has remarkable poise for a 14yearold he can dance as 
well as sing talents which director and choreographer tony tanner 
utilizes to great effect he has a rapport with worley that adds a 
dimension not found in rhodes adaptation of the story 
but anthony galde is an unmenacing teenage villain the kind of 
street punk who would have been outofdate in the original 
production of west side story there are too many dance numbers 
featuring galde and his unthreatening gang of toughs from central 
casting and chris callen is left with the thankless task of 
playing worleys daughter who is conspiring to send her mother off 
to a florida retirement community 
michael bottari and ronald case designed the revolving set 
including a large tree that spins to reveal the boys leafy 
sanctuary when blake sits there and stakes his claim to being 
the prince of central park the musical has a certain appeal 
but too often the show depends on the charms of its stars to do the 
work neglected by the book music and lyrics 
</TEXT>

what other critics said 
frank rich the new york times prince of central park 
is a numbing evening of such guileless amateurism that it will 
probably have a future as a harvard business school case study 
whatever its fate in the annals of drama 
howard kissel daily news none of this is presented with the 
slightest whimsy or genuine understanding it all passes quickly by 
in sitcomlength scenes punctuated by music and lyrics of equal 
dreariness and witlessness 
clive barnes new york post in my subjective view this show 
which started in florida should have stayed in florida the 
alligators might have found it more to their taste

three whites who proudly 
admitted to being guerrillas of the african national congress were 
sentenced on terrorism charges today to prison terms of up to 25 
years 
supporters in the courtroom threw yellow daisies at the 
defendants when the sentence was announced one defendant iain 
robertson yelled long live the anc as police pulled him away 
the two men and one woman acknowledged they were from the 
military wing of the predominantly black movement which has waged 
a bombing and sabotage campaign since 1961 to end white rule and 
apartheid 
they were arrested in may 1988 at a farmhouse outside 
johannesburg where police seized a large cache of sovietmade 
weapons it included a sam7 missile hand grenades mortar bombs 
assault rifles and pistols and was described as one of the largest 
caches ever seized in south africa 
damian de lange 31 a former journalist and leader of the cell 
was sentenced today to 25 years in prison robertson 35 received 
a 20year sentence and susan westcott 25 a native of swaziland 
whose parents are british was sentenced to 18 years 
magistrate wj van den bergh in issuing the sentences said 
the defendants were indifferent to loss of life 
they are entitled to their own political views and beliefs it 
is their transgressions of the law that must be punished he said 
the human rights commission an independent antiapartheid 
monitoring group condemned the sentences as harsh and said 
apartheid was to blame for the ancs decision to use violence 
david soggott the defense attorney said an appeal might be 
filed 
ms westcotts mother margaret westcott said afterwards we 
stand by our daughter shes done a very brave thing for this 
country 
the chief prosecutor frans roets had asked for sentences of 
125 years for de lange 110 years for robertson and 90 years for 
ms westcott 
they wanted to intimidate the population with cowardly 
attacks roets said in his summary earlier this week in pretoria 
regional court 
prosecutors said de lange detonated a bomb last year that 
damaged a bus carrying military personnel to work no one on the 
bus was seriously hurt 
the three were held in solitary confinement for seven months 
after their arrest they first appeared in court in january and 
all three pleaded guilty to terrorism charges in june

packed with arican national congress supporters many wore the 
gold green and black colors of the guerrilla movement

the bad part is they the looters tried to break into lockers 
of those that were killed said former gunners mate david james 
who said he was informed of the looting by a master at arms two 
other former shipmates who asked not to be identified confirmed 
james account 
the naval investigative service in its report on the iowa 
disaster described a locker breakin in the berthing area that 
housed those killed in turret 2 
the navy investigation concluded that gunners mate clayton 
hartwig of ohio most likely caused the april 19 explosion by 
inserting some type of detonator between bags of gunpowder in one 
of the ships 16inch guns 
rep mary rose oakar dohio said thursday she is asking navy 
secretary lawrence garrett iii to explain why iowa capt fred p 
moosally is being made eligible for another major command 
i realize that consideration and possible selection of capt 
moosally does not commit the navy to consider him for sequential 
major command but i question the propriety of such action while 
there are several congressional and navy investigations ongoing 
oakar said

abortion rights activists plan to stage nearly 1000 prochoice 
events this weekend from a sunrise rally in maine to a sunset 
gathering in california to remind lawmakers that limiting 
abortion access could be politically harmful 
since the emphasis in reproductive choice has shifted from the 
federal level to the state legislative level we feel its 
important to have demonstrations in each state said sally tyler 
executive director of the georgia abortion rights action league 
which is planning a demonstration at an atlanta park 
organizers of the campaign called mobilize for womens lives 
said the demonstrations panel discussions and other activities in 
towns and on college campuses are to remind legislators they 
represent the views of the majority of the us public abortion 
opponents said they would stage counterdemonstrations at some 
locations 
representatives of both sides said they plan to turn out for 
twoblock march on the state capitol in jackson miss 
people for choice have been invisible because of legalized 
abortion said brenda henson president of sister spirit a 
womens resource center in gulfport miss we havent been 
threatened until now now we need to stand up and say we already 
fought this battle once and we wont give up 
henson was referring to the us supreme court decision on july 
3 that stopped short of reversing the roe vs wade decision that 
legalized most abortions in 1973 but gave states more power to 
limit abortions 
sundays events will begin with a sunrise rally in kennebunk 
maine and wind up with a sunset rally in san francisco in 
washington a rally is planned at the lincoln memorial in 
washington 
at some events prochoice participants will wear purple 
clothing or purple bows the color of the womens suffrage movement 
decades ago 
samuel lee legislative chairman for missouri citizens for life 
said his group would hold a news conference in the capitol in 
jefferson city shortly before prochoice demonstrators were due to 
hold a rally outside 
asked if the purpose of the conference was to share in the news 
coverage he said i wouldnt deny that at all its a 
convenience for the media people too for us to all be in one 
place 
it was a case from missouri that led to the recent supreme court 
decision 
india mccanse an organizer of the prochoice demostration in 
the missouri capitol said the expected turnout of thousands will 
be significant because a lot of people in this country have 
written off missouri as being totally antichoice we want to 
demonstrate that is absolutely wrong

authorities arrested about 1000 moslems 
today when they tried to march to the nearby town of ayodhya where 
triumphal hindus celebrated the building of a new temple on a site 
claimed by both religions 
the moslem protest was peaceful but one of its leaders who was 
arrested zafaryab jilani warned when all these methods fail 
arms are taken up the next generation may not listen to peaceful 
protest 
at least 290 people have been killed in hindumoslem violence in 
three indian states since august when plans for the new temple 
were announced so far the violence has not spread to ayodhya and 
faizabad 330 miles southeast of the capital new delhi 
the demonstrators in faizabad accused prime minister rajiv 
gandhi and his congress party of caving in to hindu fundamentalists 
in a bid for votes from the hindu majority in national elections 
less than two weeks away 
if this ruling congress party is ousted from power perhaps 
secular government can be saved said jilani a senior leader of 
the all india babri masjid action committee 
babri masjid or the mosque of babar was built in the 17th 
century in ayodhya on the spot where hindu fundamentalists claim 
one of their most popular gods lord ram was born 
about 90 minutes after the moslems were arrested in faizabad a 
frenzied mob of hindu worshipers celebrated the placing of the 
foundation stone of a new temple to ram about 120 feet from the 
babri masjid they flung marigold petals into a 6foot hole where 
their leaders reverently placed a pile of bricks and a cornerstone 
police wearing helmets and chest protectors struggled to keep 
from falling into the pit as at least 5000 pilgrims pushed into 
the small hilltop enclave in less than an hour 
the hindumoslem dispute over the ayodhya hilltop is centuries 
old but the the current furor centers on who owns the land where 
the foundation is being laid for a new hindu temple hindus and 
moslems had agreed that one tiny plot that was to hold the 
foundation stone was owned by a hindu 
the rest of the land needed to complete the new ram temple is 
disputed 
while the moslems opposed the construction of the new temple 
they agreed they could not prevent its foundation stone from being 
placed on the little plot owned by a hindu 
so far the courts in uttar pradesh state where the government 
is headed by gandhis congress party have declined to rule who 
actually owns the property 
the demonstrators in faizabad vowed today to turn the moslem 
votes away from gandhi in national elections scheduled nov 22 24 
and 26 
after today moslems will not vote for congress said 
mohammad azam khan an uttar pradesh state legislator from the 
opposition janata party or peoples party 
hindus make up about 83 percent of indias 880 million people 
while moslems make up 11 percent of the population they have voted 
heavily for the congress party since india became independent from 
britain in 1947 
with gandhi facing a tough challenge this month from vishwanath 
pratap singh leader of the national front coalition the moslem 
vote could be pivotal

west german chancellor helmut kohl today 
interrupted his visit to poland and flew to berlin after east 
germanys historic decision to open its borders to the west 
kohl has said he would like to meet with new east german leader 
chief egon krenz but there was no official word on whether such a 
session would take place 
the state pap news agency reported in a brief dispatch that kohl 
left warsaw in the early afternoon 
other top west german officials planned to join kohl for a 
ceremony in front the schoeneberg city hall in west berlin the 
spot where president john f kennedy made his famous ich bin ein 
berliner speech in 1963 
hans klein kohls spokesman told reporters the chancellor 
would return to poland on saturday to conclude his visit 
east berlin announced suddenly thursday it was opening its 
borders and allowing its citizens to leave thousands of east 
germans immediately swarmed into west germany through the open 
berlin wall and at other crossings 
earlier thursday kohl said west germany could be ready to 
offer significant economic aid if the will to reform manifested 
itself in east germany 
in addition to opening his countrys borders krenz said the 
country would hold democratic elections but it was not clear if 
the elections would include parties competing with the ruling 
communists 
kohl also said he had discussed with us officials the 
possibility of housing mounting numbers of east german refugees in 
us facilities in west germany 
his sixday visit here was intended to move the world war ii 
enemies closer to reconciliation the developments in east germany 
however drew attention away from the economic issues expected to 
be the focus of the summit 
the developments have fueled polish fears about german 
reunification and have forced longsimmering border issues to the 
forefront of kohls visit 
creation of a superpower in the heart of europe is not a 
neutral concern for the future of a whole europe said polish 
deputy goverment spokesman henryk wozniakowski 
certainly poland is now looking more seriously on the 
possibility of german reunification he said 
wozniakowski said poland recognizes the sovereign rights of both 
german states but the question of reunification is not just a 
german question it is also a european question he said 
combined with polish fears of a new economic superpower were 
worries over recent comments by west german conservatives that 
reunification should be sought within the 1937 borders of the 
german reich those borders include large areas of what is now 
poland 
a 1970 treaty between west germany and poland recognizes the 
oder and neisse rivers as the western boundary of poland but a 
reunified germany would not be bound to those terms 
malgorzata niezabitowska spokeswoman for prime minister tadeusz 
masowiecki said the prime minister stressed that polish people 
must have certainty that the question of borders be settled 
permanently 
kohl also met with solidarity leader lech walesa the driving 
force behind the trade union movements rise to control of the 
government 
the west german leader came to poland with a billiondollar 
economic package that is crucial for the new government to make the 
difficult transition toward a marketoriented economy 
mazowieckis government has asked for huge amounts of western 
economic aid saying it is needed to safeguard the transition to 
democracy

many of the beloved victorian buildings 
that give the city its charm are in jeopardy say preservationists 
battling to have the quakedamaged structures repaired instead of 
razed 
hundreds of the beauties that survived the 1906 quake may not 
make it through 1989 the preservationists charged thursday saying 
city regulations aimed at getting unsafe buildings torn down may 
force property owners to take precipitous action 
mark ryser executive director of the foundation for san 
franciscos architectural heritage criticized the citys procedure 
for inspecting damaged buildings he spoke at a news conference in 
front of saint dominics church where workers were removing a 
tower damaged in the oct 17 quake 
he said owners are not being given time to consider 
rehabilitation in lieu of demolition and said structural engineers 
doing voluntary inspections for the city may lack the expertise to 
adequately assess building hazards 
city officials defended the inspection and notification process 
we havent torn down that many buildings only those that pose 
an imminent life hazard or are a danger to adjacent property 
said public works director richard evans im tired of people 
taking potshots at the process because its a good process 
although some buildings were razed immediately after the quake 
deputy mayor of housing brad paul said recent efforts have focused 
on rehabilitation 
more than 1400 housing units are in buildings that have been 
redtagged by the city requiring owners to promptly shore up 
or demolish the buildings paul said 
an additional 3647 units are in buildings with limited access 
he said adding that total replacement costs are estimated at close 
to 200 million 
kathryn burns of the national trust for historic preservation 
estimated that up to 500 historic buildings may be threatened in 
the sevencounty area hit by the quake which measured 71 on the 
richter scale 
fewer than 200 buildings in san francisco are designated 
landmarks but about 2000 more are in designated historic 
districts said ryser 
to help increase options for property owners the trust has 
established a special lowinterest loan program for owners of 
quakedamaged historic buildings the funds would be available to 
stabilize buildings while rehabilitation assessments are made she 
said 
emergency legislation to prevent the demolition of any buildings 
not in imminent danger of collapse was signed by gov george 
deukmejian on monday 
natural disasters cannot serve as a pretext for rash decisions 
to destroy important relics of california history said state 
sen milton marks who sponsored the legislation 
preservationists are worried about residential neighborhood 
buildings as well as public buildings 
as an example ryser cited a 1908 building on front street that 
he said was needlessly razed although the front of the building 
was a public hazard and had to be removed the entire structure did 
not have to be demolished he said 
unnecessary demolitions may occur because owners are not aware 
of rehabilitation options cannot get qualified engineers to 
inspect the property within cityordered time limits or believe 
demolition is mandatory ryser said he conceded that some owners 
may be looking for a convenient rationale to tear down unwanted 
property 
a new city ordinance allows tenants who fear that landlords are 
unfairly trying to remove rental units from the market to call in 
an independent structural engineer to assess quake damage paul 
said

moslem fundamentalists many of them 
campaigning under the slogan islam is the solution won the 
biggest bloc of seats in parliament during this kingdoms first 
general election in 22 years 
the result was an apparent setback for king hussein who urged 
voters not to mix religion with politics in wednesdays vote 
fundamentalist candidates captured 34 of the 80 seats in 
parliament according to results announced thursday 
about 20 seats were won by progovernment candidates while 
leftists arab nationalists tribal leaders and others took the 
rest the breakdown gave opposition forces a clear majority over 
strict loyalists 
for the first time women were allowed to vote and seek office 
but none of the 12 females among the 647 candidates won a seat 
the people want islam and it is not strange for our country 
and our people to have such a large number of moslem candidates 
winning said ziad abu ghanimeh a spokesman for the moslem 
brotherhood the largest islamic organization 
the brotherhood called for more social welfare programs to help 
the poor and for a palestinian state on israeli territory 
its 26 declared and several undeclared candidates held the 
largest rallies in the campaign including one in amman attended by 
about 5000 people 
though the fundamentalists have often allied themselves with 
hussein they have also prodded him to embrace a stricter version 
of islam with restrictions on westerntype entertainment more 
social welfare programs and greater separation of the sexes 
the new parliament seems certain to be more assertive than the 
legislature dissolved last year although hussein retains ultimate 
power 
parliament must approve all laws and can dissolve cabinets but 
the king can dissolve parliament and rule without it and he has 
done so for much of the past 15 years 
the winners included mansour murad who was convicted of 
participating in a 1969 attack on an athens office of the israeli 
state airline elal the attack killed a greek child and wounded 11 
people 
he was freed in 1970 in an exchange for 55 hostages aboard a 
hijacked olympic airways jetliner 
during the campaign many candidates who went on to win seats 
demanded prosecution of former officials accused of corruption and 
economic mismanagement 
the nation has a foreign debt of 83 million and financial 
hardship led to four days of rioting in april 
the election formalized jordans separation from the west bank 
which held half the seats in the parliament that was elected two 
months before israel captured the territory in 1967 
last year hussein renounced jordans claims to the west bank in 
favor the palestine liberation organization and dissolved 
parliament

world leaders today praised east germanys opening 
of its borders with some predicting the eventual dismantling of 
the hideous construction the berlin wall and the 
reunification of germany 
the united states britain and france offered their military 
camps in west germany to handle the expected flood of emigres 
czechoslovakia which had become the gathering point for east 
germans fleeing west breathed a sigh of relief 
britains prime minister margaret thatcher called it a great 
day for freedom and said soviet president mikhail s gorbachev 
the architect of east bloc reforms had made it possible 
willy brandt a former west german chancellor and the west 
berlin mayor when the berlin wall went up in 1961 said he believed 
prospects for german unity had taken a major step forward 
the berlin wall will come down and berlin will live brandt 
told the associated press 
it seems appropriate that this hideous construction which 
never should have been built has now definitely lost it reason for 
being said foreign minister uffe ellemannjensen of denmark 
it wasnt just the landscape of european politics which 
suddenly changed last night it was the european cosmos wrote 
political columnist neal ascherson in the london newspaper the 
independent 
for most west europeans now alive the world has always ended 
at the east german border and the berlin wall beyond lay 
darkness and demons the opening of the frontiers declares that the 
world has no edge any more europe is becoming once more round and 
whole he wrote 
austrian chancellor franz vranitzky said the move was one of 
the most memorable events in the political history of europe 
prime minister brian mulroney of canada said it was one of the 
most powerful statements about the strength of democracy 
not everyone was so impressed finnish prime minister harri 
holkeri told finnish radio as far as i can see the final 
outcome of world war ii still stands and the situation will not 
change because of these developments 
the superpowers were relatively subdued 
president bush said if east germany makes good on its promise to 
allow free emigration this wall built in 61 will have very 
little relevance 
soviet foreign ministry spokesman gennady i gerasimov praised 
east german reforms but said any speculation about a reunified 
germany is out of the question 
the us ambassador to the north atlantic treaty alliance 
william h taft iv agreed he also told reporters in portugal that 
the changes under way in eastern europe increase the risk of 
instability 
czechoslovak foreign ministry spokesman lubomir marsik said the 
opening of the east german border represents a positive 
solution the situation was getting difficult for everybody 
including czechoslovakia he said referring to the thousands of 
east germans who previously were forced to go west via a third 
country often czechoslovakia 
in an interview on french radio french foreign minister roland 
dumas said the reforms will probably change the global balance 
he tied them to rapid changes also sweeping hungary and poland 
we have the duty first of all to assume responsibilities in 
aiding these countries he said 
the times of london headlined its report the iron curtain 
torn open 
mrs thatcher said we all hope this is only the prelude to 
the dismantling of the berlin wall but added that the priority 
must be to see a genuinely democratic government in east 
germany 
she bush and french defense minister jeanpierre chevenement 
offered the use of their countries military camps in west germany 
to temporarily house any flood of emigres 
spains foreign minister francisco fernandez ordonez said the 
opening of the border was a step full of hope that will likely 
lead to further reforms 
in japan foreign ministry spokesman taizo watanabe told foreign 
journalists today the berlin wall has in substance been lifted 
and it has great historical significance 
in south korea governing party spokesman park huitae used the 
occasion to prod communist north korea 
on the occasion of east germanys border opening north korea 
is urged once again to make active efforts to conduct exchanges 
with south korea and open up its doors in keeping pace with the 
tides of the time he said 
the european community in brussels pledged to seek closer trade 
relations with the government in east berlin

rejoicing throughout europe the ecs external affairs

a soviet spokesman said today that east germanys 
decision to open its borders was well received in the soviet union 
but he reiterated the kremlins opposition to reunification of 
germany 
gennady i gerasimov chief spokesman for the soviet foreign 
ministry called the east german governments throwing open of its 
borders a sovereign act of east germany reiterating the 
kremlins determination not to interfere in the internal affairs of 
its east bloc partners 
but he reminded soviet and foreign reporters at a foreign 
ministry briefing the border still remains though some might 
think it ceased to exist 
east berliners streamed into west berlin today following joyous 
overnight celebrations after east germany opened its borders 
thousands of east germans also crossed into west germany along the 
nations frontier 
gerasimov cited a statement by east german leader egon krenz at 
a nov 1 press conference in moscow at which krenz said the border 
exists due to other reasons and not for the purpose of 
interfering with contacts between people 
krenz pointed out then the berlin wall marks the division 
between political systems as well as between the military alliances 
of east and west 
gerasimov said the border opening was part of the wide 
democratization of life taking place in east germany where the 
recent replacement of hardline communist leader erich honecker 
touched off a popular rush toward reform 
these are not separate acts but fullscale measures embracing 
the whole of life of the gdr east germany and its contacts with 
the outside world the soviet spokesman said the measures that 
have been taken were welcomed in east germany and there was 
also a positive reaction abroad including in the soviet union 
but gerasimov said west germany should take into account that 
policies aimed at reconsidering borders would not suit any 
government in europe and would cause only mistrust 
soviet foreign minister eduard shevardnandze today also welcomed 
the opening of east germanys border to the west swedish 
journalists meeting with the envoy in moscow reported 
shevardnadze was quoted as saying the kremlin had nothing to do 
with the decision to open the gates in the berlin wall which he 
said was an internal affair 
it was decided by the comrades in berlin he said this 
was a reasonable and sensible decision he said and he described 
the developments as a normal process toward greater democracy 
in east germany 
the new course in east germany echos the mood among the people 
in east germany it also corresponds to our own interests he 
said according to a report by the swedish national tt news agency 
and swedish radio in stockholm 
shevardnadze who met the reporters accompanying foreign 
minister sten andersson said people should be helped to reunite 
with relatives or to travel abroad for other reasons and said he 
was undisturbed by the sight of tens of thousands of east germans 
flooding across the frontiers 
its not abnormal for people to leave their countries 
sometimes they return he said twenty thousand people leave 
the soviet union every year that in itself is not unusual 
he also said moscow was not worried that the swift pace of 
events in east europe would threaten global stability 
the events in east germany have been covered on soviet 
television and in the press but with little editorial comment 
tass the soviet news agency reported the opening of the 
borders without delay 
the soviet union in the past two years has eased the strict 
control of its borders and now grants thousands of exit visas a 
month to soviet citizens wishing to travel abroad or emigrate but 
relatively few soviets are eligible to emigrate under present law 
a bill before the legislature would grant all citizens the right 
to come and go as they please except in cases when the state 
determines national security might be threatened but the measure 
is still up for debate

an civil rights group has asked the army to 
investigate reports of soldiers forcing palestinians to perform 
ridiculous and humiliating tasks such as singing army songs and 
sweeping the streets 
the association for civil rights in israel has asked the armys 
legal adviser to stop the manifestly illegal practice in the 
ein bet alma refugee camp in the israelioccupied west bank said 
dan simon the groups lawyer 
they force the inhabitants to perform ridiculous and 
humiliating tasks such as sweeping streets washing the streets 
and so forth said simon 
its usually done in the middle of the night he said the 
people are called out their id cards are taken away from them and 
returned at the end of the work 
israeli officials said today that a preliminary check indicated 
soldiers made residents of the camp clean up rubble from tires set 
on fire demonstrators 
theres no initial indication of improper behavior by the 
soldiers but the story is being investigated said an army 
spokesman who by israeli army regulations cannot be identified 
simon said the army legally can force palestinians to remove 
roadblocks put up by demonstrators and to erase graffiti and can 
confiscate their identification cards while they do the work 
but forcing palestinians to clean streets and pick up cigarette 
butts and pebbles is manifestly illegal he said he also 
complained that six residents were made to march around the camp 
singing an israeli army song one night last month 
what we expect to hear is what the army is doing to make sure 
these things do not reoccur he said 
simon said he probably will petition israels supreme court if 
the army does not take action he said the practices were a local 
kind of initiative and were not widespread 
also today arab reporters said israeli soldiers wounded a 
12yearold boy in the gaza strip army officials said they were 
unaware of any such incident

a nicaraguan rebel leader today spurned a 
government proposal for his forces to disband and instead vowed at 
the first peace talks in 16 months to put an end to the regime 
in managua 
chief contra negotiator enrique bermudez just before heading 
into the second day of talks today said he had reason to doubt 
the sincerity of the sandinista offer of a truce and amnesty 
bermudez said the sandinistas did not offer a true amnesty but 
merely offered to release political prisoners from jail stopping 
short of restoring their civil and political rights 
talks between the usbacked contra rebels and the sandinista 
government opened thursday nicaraguas foreign minister said 
before the talks that if the rebels agreed to demobilize his 
government would meet their demands for a truce and amnesty 
the contras countered with a plan to restore the ceasefire with 
the government which was called off last week and discuss other 
conditions such as demobilization later 
neither proposal was accepted despite the urging of un 
secretarygeneral javier perez de cuellar to renew the ceasefire 
that president daniel ortega ended 
an estimated 12000 people have been killed in the 8yearold 
war 
perez de cuellar and his organization of american states 
counterpart joao clemente baena soares turned the mediation 
effort over to aides 
an election campaign is under way in nicaragua under a regional 
peace accord signed in august the plan calls for free and fair 
elections 
voting is set for feb 25 and un observers say the campaign 
is proceeding smoothly 
foreign minister miguel descoto of nicaragua said before the 
meeting that key contra demands would be met if demobilization 
began by the end of november 
documents obtained by the associated press showed the contras 
opening position calling for an immediate truce the sandinistas 
would then declare a amnesty for the rebels by nov 20 
the estimated 12000 contras camped in honduras would then move 
into nicaragua with their weapons to join their comrades there in 
secure zones 
diplomats said this would remove the pressure placed on honduras 
under the central american peace plan to shut down the contra camps 
by dec 5 
only after these steps had been completed would discussion of 
disbanding the contras begin under the rebel proposal 
deputy foreign minister victor hugo tinoco who leads 
nicaraguas delegation to the un meeting rejected the contra 
proposal as presented 
descoto waving a copy of sandinista proposals said the 
contras say they require three things the three things are met 
by what we are offering 
descoto said the nicaraguan delegation was willing to stay in 
new york beyond the two days allotted for the talks and would be 
flexible this is a proposal not an ultimatum he said of the 
sandinista document 
in miami the contras announced formation of a new 
civilianmilitary commission to replace the old directorate 
several of whose members have resigned and returned to nicaragua 
contra military spokesman alejandro acevedo said the un 
negotiating team led by contra military commander enrique bermudez 
had recognized the new commission which includes only one of the 
former directors aristides sanchez 
ousted civilian contra leaders compared the action to a coup 
when bermudez arrived for the un meeting he said we expect 
to reestablish the ceasefire and put an end to the totalitarian 
government in nicaragua 
in refusing to renew the ceasefire after 19 weeks ortega cited 
increased contra attacks in nicaragua contra leaders denied the 
rebels were attacking which is forbidden by congress while they 
still receive us aid 
congress ended us military aid to the contras in 1988 but has 
continued nonlethal aid 
honduras where most of the 12000 contras are encamped and 
cardinal miguel obando y bravo of managua are attending the peace 
talks as observers 
the last direct talks between the sandinistas and contras broke 
down in june 1988 they agreed to a 90day ceasefire during that 
session in march and nicaragua had extended it on a monthly 
basis with tacit agreement from the contras

operators of a rayon plant that supplies 
the pentagon say it must remain open in defiance of the states 
revocation of its waste water discharge permit so that it can clean 
up pollutants 
the state water control board voted 60 thursday to revoke the 
permit of avtex fibers incs front royal plant effective 
immediately the water board said avtex violated the permit by 
discharging polychlorinated biphenyls or pcbs into the shenandoah 
river 
david a tousignant the plants president told reporters an 
orderly shutdown of the plant would take months and would halt the 
companys efforts to clean up the toxic chemical 
we cant let this happen its not in anybodys best 
interest he said 
he maintained that an immediate shutdown is impossible and that 
the company could not clean up the pcbs without continuing to 
operate avtexs waste water treatment facility which discharges 
into the river 
if youre not operating then you have no resources to do 
anything he said 
avtex lawyers failed to persuade richmond circuit judge theodore 
j markow to stay the order and were considering an appeal to the 
states court of appeals which was closed today for veterans day 
markow is to preside over a trial wednesday of a state lawsuit 
seeking closure of the plant and fines and damages against avtex 
the permit revocation followed markows rejections of two state 
requests to close the plant pending the trial 
the company could be liable for as much as 10000 a day in 
fines for making illegal discharges said bert rohrer a spokesman 
for the state attorney generals office 
during two days of hearings last week the attorney generals 
office said state testing found as much as 3 pounds of pcbs 
flowing toward the river daily in august the state said pcbs have 
contaminated the plant site since a december 1985 leak of some 500 
gallons of the highly toxic oils from an electrical transformer 
the state has accused avtex and the federal government of 
knowingly allowing the pollution to continue which tousignant 
denied 
when we found out ourselves that we had a problem we took 
immediate action he said 
the federal government has worked for years to keep various 
pollution and worker safety problems from shutting the more than 
50yearold plant which is the only supplier of a carbonizable 
rayon fiber used in rocket nozzles for the space shuttle and 
nuclear missiles 
water board members said they were concerned about the nearly 
400 employees at avtex who could lose their jobs but they were 
more worried about the pollution 
this was all brought about by actions and inactions on the 
part of avtex said donald m plotkin a board member 
velma m smith board chairwoman said the boards investigation 
showed avtex knew it had violated its permit by discharging pcbs 
long before it began cleaning up the toxins this year 
avtex did not take the issuance of a permit seriously she 
said 
the public found out about the pollution in may when state 
officials warned people not to eat fish from the river

president bush lauding east germanys lifting 
of travel restrictions as a dramatic advance for freedom is 
ordering all possible assistance to help west germany cope with 
the flood of refugees from its communist sister state 
and secretary of state james a baker iii reflecting today on 
thursdays borderopening decree by east german authorities said 
he hoped it would lead to greater freedoms hopefully now 
theyll move in the area of other freedoms hopefully well see 
movement toward free and open democratic elections he said on 
cbs this morning 
bush boarding his helicopter today for a trip to texas waved 
off questions about the fastmoving developments spokesman marlin 
fitzwater said however that the president intended to talk to 
west german chancellor helmut kohl by telephone later today 
in another tv interview on abcs good morning america 
baker said it was premature to talk about the reunification of 
germany because east germany had a long way to go before becoming 
truly democratic 
there are some steps that have to be taken between just giving 
people one of the basic human rights the freedom to travel 
between that and addressing the question of reunification of 
germany he said 
baker also linked western financial aid to east germany to 
greater freedoms including free and open elections i think 
its going to be the view frankly of some of our other allies 
that assistance will be much more forthcoming if the german 
democratic republic east germany moves toward true reform in 
terms of political pluralism across the board he said 
nonetheless the secretary said i think its the most 
dramatic event in eastwest relations since the end of the war 
baker acknowledged that the speed of the east german action 
caught us officials off guard 
were we surprised by the speed of it you bet your life and 
so was everybody else as far as i can determine he told cbs i 
dont know anybody who suggested that they predicted this was going 
to happen its a very good development im not the least bit 
ashamed of saying that the rapidness of it came as somewhat of a 
surprise 
if east germany fully implements the promise to open its 
borders bush told reporters thursday this berlin wall built 
in 61 will have very little relevance 
it was just 6 months ago in a speech in mainz west germany 
that bush added his voice to the chorus of us presidents who have 
demanded that the berlin wall be torn down he called it then a 
brutal wall that stands as a monument to the failure of 
communism it must come down 
former president reagan said on the abc television show prime 
time live that if the wall isnt torn down immediately at 
least they could keep the gates open 
east germany said it was opening its borders to the rest of the 
world and that its citizens may travel or emigrate anywhere 
including through the 28yearold berlin wall erected at the 
height of the cold war between east and west 
its a dramatic happening for east germany and of course for 
freedom bush said 
the white house announced thursday night that bush had ordered 
us military units and us ambassador vernon walters to give 
all possible assistance to the west german government 
struggling to cope with the flood of refugees the pentagon said it 
was making available housing for 980 people in three offbase 
installations 
defense department spokesman glenn flood said today there has 
been no new west german request for additional assistance and 
there have been no new pentagon offers of military assistance 
beyond what was made thursday 
other us leaders reacted with a mixture of joy and surprise 
senate majority leader george mitchell of maine called it a 
symbolic destruction of the berlin wall and urged east germany 
to take the final step and tear that wall down 
the events of today are truly remarkable said vice 
president dan quayle 
bush with secretary of state baker at his side and a map of 
germany open on his desk said we salute the people in east 
germany whose aspirations for freedom seem to be a little more 
down the road now 
bush seemed subdued in an exchange with reporters summoned to 
the oval office to hear his reaction to the latest startling news 
from the east bloc 
i am not an emotional kind of guy he explained but he 
added i feel very good about it 
bush said he was prepared to give maximum help to bonn to 
cope with refugees some 200000 east germans have fled their 
country this year through hungary czechoslovakia or other routes 
west 
but recalling his advice last spring to poles to stay in their 
homeland to work for democratic reforms bush said 
these are germans and germans love their country and at some 
point i think a lot of germans who have felt pentin and unable to 
move are going to say look we can move but wouldnt it be better 
to participate in the reforms that are taking place in our own 
country 
bush said that when he meets with soviet president mikhail s 
gorbachev next month in the mediterranean he would discuss 
additional steps the united states might take to help spur change 
in east europe including possible restoration of longdenied us 
trade benefits 
sounding a note of caution bush said i dont think any 
single event is the end of what you might call the iron curtain 
but clearly this is a long way from the harshest iron curtain 
days 
at a state dinner for philippine president corazon aquino bush 
told reporters he has sent a message to the west german government 
saying he wants to talk to chancellor helmut kohl when he returns 
from a visit to poland 
secretary of state baker said east germanys action is a very 
welcome and positive and significant development i dont think 
anybody would have predicted it three or four days ago 
hopefully well see more steps toward freedom in east 
germany said baker once people taste the fruits of freedom 
you dont put the genie back in the bottle 
at the pentagon defense secretary dick cheney said the odds of 
military forces from east germany being used against the west 
appeared to be significantly lower now than at any time in the 
postwar period 
retired army gen bernard rogers who was supreme allied 
commander in europe from 1979 to 1987 gave a similar assessment on 
nbctvs today show this morning 
i think that all indicators from at least 1987 on are that the 
threat of war is reduced at least that should be our perception at 
the present time rogers said 
dean rusk who was president kennedys secretary of state when 
the wall was erected said i never thought i would live to see 
the day the implications of it are very farreaching 
the west germans may have a problem absorbing all the east 
germans who will want to move there but thats something the west 
germans will just have to struggle with said rusk now a law 
professor at the university of georgia 
but its obvious that in eastern europe several things have 
been set in motion that are irreversible and that cannot be taken 
back to the worst of the cold war days

a predawn army shootemup complete 
with machine gun fire flares and soldiers racing through 
civilians yards has the sheriff well up in arms 
the mock military attack came on thursday at 430 am a time 
sheriff jay printz said was totally inappropriate 
calls from terrified residents came in so quickly my lone 
dispatcher couldnt get everybodys name printz said 
one woman was so scared she was calling from the bathroom 
whered shed locked herself in the sheriff said 
callers told of unidentified men firing automatic weapons and 
shooting flares and warriors racing across the deck of a private 
house printz said 
the army was essentially having a little war in an area just 
outside corvallis which is south of missoula in western montana 
printz said 
complaints focused on rude disruptions in the predawn trespass 
on private property spooked livestock bouncing off barbedwire 
fences and potential fires from flares on roofs the sheriff said 
army officials refused to say anything other than there would be 
an investigation of the complaints 
margaret searle said her family thought it was a war zone 
outside her husband got his rifle and fired a round into a wood 
pile to scare off the soldiers she said 
the woman said military investigators came by later and told her 
the special forces troops were making a mock attempt to blow up a 
fuel depot she noted there are some fuel storage tanks a few 
hundred yards from the family residence 
printz said he was told last summer that parts of exercise 
knife blade 90 would occur in ravalli county this fall he was 
never informed about specific operations but was promised they 
would not be near residential areas he said 
he told military officials that if theres another similar 
occurrence deputies will be making arrests printz said

the british broadcasting corp said friday its 
mandarinlanguage broadcasts to china are being jammed for the 
first time 
there is no possible justification for this deliberate and 
systematic interference with our broadcasts although it clearly 
indicates the impact the world service is having inside china as 
far as the authorities are concerned said john tusa managing 
director of the bbc world service 
the bbc said the interference typically starts a few minutes 
before the mandarin transmissions begin and stops shortly after 
they end it takes the form of a steady lowfrequency noise about 
25 percent as strong as the program signal itself 
the bbc said it did not know exactly how long the interference 
had been taking place there has been evidence of it since june but 
it was only positively identified this week by a bbc engineer in 
beijing it said 
jamming is a practice which violates established broadcasting 
relations tusa said this latest instance is particularly 
regrettable at a time when jamming from all other communist 
countries has ceased 
the soviet union stopped jamming bbc russian service broadcasts 
in 1987 and lifted its interference with bbc polish broadcasts a 
year later 
the bbc said world service broadcasts in english are not being 
jammed by the chinese but it is still unclear whether cantonese 
language broadcasts are affected 
the bbc said it stepped up its mandarin broadcasts by half an 
hour in early june to a total of three hours daily in response to 
demands for coverage of the studentled demonstrations in china and 
the governments crackdown 
during the beijing protests students carried banners saying 
thank you bbc and some wore bbc headbands

a team of observers from the 
organization of american states dashed out of the voter 
registration station and scrambled into a caravan of waiting 
vehicles 
in the confusion some of them jumped into a un jeep at the 
curb and ordered the bewildered driver follow that caravan 
when the string of vehicles screeched to a halt at the next 
station and the observers again jumped out the un driver peeled 
off and returned to his employers hoping they hadnt missed him 
there are so many observers in this little country you find 
them in the soup said a latin american diplomatic source who 
requested anonymity but that is good wed rather have too many 
than too few 
foreign observers are swarming all over nicaragua in such 
profusion that the foreign ministry felt compelled to call a news 
conference to explain who is doing what 
there are observers for the electoral process leading to general 
elections feb 25 observers to make sure the antisandinista 
rebels known as contras disband observers to a regional accord not 
to arm guerrillas and selfappointed observers of foreign 
contributions to political parties 
a 625member force approved by the un security council is the 
latest addition to the battalions of observers in central america 
they are to verify that contras dont slip across the border from 
honduras into nicaragua 
observing elections has become an industry said british 
government observer david browning of oxford university but 
whos observing the observers 
there are observer teams from the oas the united nations joint 
commissions from both organizations the european parliament 
former president jimmy carter one us government foundation and 
one private us foundation 
apart from that there are individuals and groups representing 
the political spectrum descending on nicaragua in droves us 
congressmen come down singly or in clusters 
it seems like we get one every weekend said a western 
diplomatic source i dont know the last time we had a full 
weekend off 
oas secretarygeneral joao baena soares headed his 
organizations mission to observe the first sunday of registration 
oct 1 he and his retinue visited 35 voter registration stations 
in five communities within 12 hours 
the confusion over the jeeps happened at one of those stations 
in nicaraguas severely depressed economy observers are good 
business they need housing food transportation they need office 
space drivers and secretaries 
housing in the managua area the center of operations for all 
these groups is scarce the laws of demand and supply take over 
property rental agents are delighted but the observer staff 
members are not 
i was shown the same house three times in one day by three 
different agents said a un observer every time the rental 
price was different each time it was higher 
the observers first job was to watch over voter registration 
during the first four sundays in october it ended oct 22 the 
united nations and the oas released reports calling the 
registration process largely free and fair 
now their job is to keep watch over the campaigning and ensure 
every one of the 21 legally registered parties in nicaragua has a 
chance to spread its message freely

state police were warned by the states 
chief justice six years ago to stop taping private conversations 
between attorneys and their clients but the taping continued and 
led to a federal lawsuit 
the class action lawsuit filed thursday names the state and 19 
highranking state police officials allegedly involved in secret 
taping as far back as 1980 hundreds of thousands of 
conversations may have been taped at about a dozen state police 
barracks around the state said michael koskoff a lawyer who 
called a news conference to announce the lawsuit 
in 1983 former state chief justice john a speziale warned 
police to stop taperecording suspects telephone conversations 
with their lawyers 
eavesdropping by the police or their agents makes a mockery of 
the right to consult counsel before being interrogated speziale 
wrote in a 1983 ruling on a 1980 tape recording of a lawyer talking 
to his client 
the taping resurfaced inadvertantly oct 24 when a state trooper 
testified at a hearing in a manslaughter case that a conversation 
between the suspect and his attorney had been taped 
gov william a oneill on tuesday ordered an investigation into 
the taping policy and thursday federal prosecutors asked chief 
states attorney john j kelly to turn over the 763 state police 
tapes containing 18000 hours of conversations that were 
impounded when oneill opened the probe 
state police claim the taping was done to ensure that emergency 
telephone calls to the barracks could be replayed in case the call 
was unclear or if someone had a complaint about the way a call was 
handled 
the taping posed a political problem for oneill a democrat up 
for reelection next year his adversaries in both parties called 
on him to fire state police cmdr lester j forst the lead 
defendant in the case 
the lawsuit seeks damages of at least 10000 for each person 
who joins the class action and punitive damages under federal 
racketeering statutes 
if anybody made a phone call from the state police barracks 
and spoke to someone other than a police officer they can pretty 
well assume their phone call was intercepted koskoff said at the 
news conference we even had information there were police 
officers who didnt even know these phones were being tapped 
the lawsuit could overturn criminal convictions if the court 
found an illegally taped conversation led to the conviction said 
joseph keefe president of the 200member connecticut criminal 
defense lawyers association which filed the suit 
people make the most damaging admissions when theyre arrested 
because theyre upset keefe said adding i suppose nothing 
should should shock us but to violate the right to counsel to do 
that knowingly 
normally police must obtain warrants to conduct secret wiretaps 
or tape conversations the taping also appears to have violated 
privileged lawyerclient conversations 
forst has been on a hunting vacation in alaska oneill said 
wednesday he was not inclined to fire forst whom he hired in 1981 
before speaking with him 
the state police is not the only department in connecticut to 
stand accused of secret taping the waterbury republican reported 
today that police in torrington a town north of 30000 of 
waterbury routinely taped conversations between prisoners and 
lawyers and at least once refused a lawyers demand that the taping 
be stopped 
attorney john logan said he helped another lawyer john del 
buono get charges against a client reduced because tapes had been 
made of del buonos conversations with the client a year ago even 
though del buono objected 
torrington police chief mahlon c sabo said he was unaware of 
the taping until thursday and it would be stopped the department 
makes tapes of all calls on the departments main business line 
and because of equipment shortages the telephone that prisoners 
use is hooked up to that line he said 
im embarrassed i didnt know said sabo whos been chief 
about 3 years i dont know why and this phone system 
certainly has been here a lot longer than i have

philippine president corazon had breakfast 
today with vice president dan quayle and usbacked nicaraguan 
opposition candidate violeta chamorro and a quayle aide said the 
administration hoped some of the visiting leaders popularity would 
rub off 
mrs chamorro is in the united states this week seeking to raise 
funds for her february election against leftist president daniel 
ortega 
a quayle aide carnes lord said the two women both the wives 
of slain national leaders discussed their common experiences in 
entering politics 
asked if mrs chamorro hoped to cash in on some of mrs aquinos 
popularity lord said that was the idea obviously 
he said the threeway meeting at the vice presidents residence 
had been suggested to mrs aquino during quayles recent visit to 
the philippines 
mrs aquino is not dropping any clues about the fate of us 
military bases in her country but president bush says he is 
confident an agreement will be reached for a longterm security 
partnership 
bush was effusive in his praise for mrs aquino during meetings 
at the white house on thursday despite her reluctance to discuss 
continued us access to clark air base and subic bay naval base 
from main street to wall street america loves the 
philippines and america loves cory aquino bush said in 
welcoming remarks 
you deserve our help and you will get it i pledge our 
continuing assistance to your government and that means security 
assistance as well as aid to economic development bush said 
and it means cooperating in your important debtreduction 
programs 
the future of the two massive bases is the most important and 
most controversial issue on the usphilippine agenda 
leases for the facilities expire in september 1991 and the 
united states regards them as a vital for projecting american 
military power throughout southeast asian sea lanes and for 
stability in the pacific they serve as a counterpoint to soviet 
naval forces based in vietnam 
mrs aquino faces pressure at home to end the us access an 
influential minority of filipinos view the continued us military 
presence as an infringement on philippine sovereignty and a vestige 
of the former us colonial administration 
before leaving washington today mrs aquino planned to meet 
with defense secretary dick cheney then she was heading to dallas 
to meet with officials of the large retailing chain jc penney a 
major importer of philippine products 
in a toast at a state dinner thursday night bush lauded her 
monumental political and economic accomplishments and said her 
countrys revolution had inspired freedomloving people 
everywhere 
mrs aquino in a poignant reply said the philippines is a 
small country and cannot claim to affect directly events beyond its 
borders certainly not across half the world in europe 
but after reciting the startling changes underway in the 
east bloc she said yet it is not too much to say that the 
images of heroism spawned by our people power revolution gave 
dominated peoples throughout the world a glimpse of certain 
possibilities that they are now exploring the possibility for 
example that armor and infantry do not exhaust the varieties of 
power 
mrs aquino told reporters after the dinner many times people 
approach me in my travels abroad and say they are truly inspired by 
what happened in the philippines in 1986 im very glad were 
identified with something so noble and so pure 
earlier at the white house bush noted that preliminary talks on 
the bases will begin next month and said we are confident well 
mold a new and mutually beneficial longterm security partnership 
in the future 
steering clear of the basing issue mrs aquino emphasized the 
themes of trade and investment 
we will raise particularly the means by which the philippines 
and the united states can cooperate in more ways to our mutual 
economic benefit we shall explore the means to increase trade 
between two countries with long historic ties and deep cultural 
affinities 
it was her first visit to the white house since 1986 when she 
received a tumultuous welcome after leading the successful campaign 
to depose president ferdinand marcos ending years of authoritarian 
rule 
your leadership has made the philippines a beacon of 
democracy worthy of imitation throughout the world bush told 
mrs aquino 
in their talks bush mentioned the bases only in a passing 
reference to next months talks said richard solomon assistant 
secretary of state for east asian affairs he said mrs aquino 
expressed no sentiment one way or the other 
mrs aquino pressed bush for greater access to us markets 
help in debt relief and us investment in the philippines solomon 
said he said she specifically mentioned us quotas on textile and 
sugar imports 
us and philippine officials signed a 25 million aid agreement 
thursday to lay the groundwork for telecommunications 
transportation energy and other infrastructure projects 
while congress rushed through a 200 million aid package for the 
philippines after mrs aquino took office there is less eagerness 
now because some lawmakers believe economic reform and increased 
trade would improve living standards there more than additional 
economic aid

health officials are investigating whether 
an outbreak of a rare blood disorder that has affected 26 people in 
five states is linked to a dietary supplement taken for stress and 
premenstrual syndrome 
twentyone cases of eosinophilia have been confirmed in new 
mexico over the past two to three months dr millicent eidson 
environmental epidemiologist with the state health and environment 
department said late thursday 
she said an additional case has been reported in arizona the 
mayo clinic in rochester minn said a missouri man and a 
mississippi woman are being treated for the disease and an fda 
official in denver said two cases have been reported in oregon 
at least 19 of the patients had been taking ltryptophan an 
amino acid commonly taken to relieve premenstrual syndrome sleep 
disorders muscle tension and stress the nonprescription tablets 
are sold under a variety of brand names in health food stores and 
pharmacies 
eosinophilia occurs when there is an abnormally high number of 
eosinophils a type of white cell in the blood it has been known 
to be fatal although officials said there have been no deaths 
among the recent 26 cases 
ms eidson said of the cases in new mexico and arizona 17 were 
among women sixteen of the 17 women and one of the five men had 
taken ltryptophan she said 
teams from the federal food and drug administration and the 
centers for disease control came to new mexico on thursday to 
assist in the investigation 
dr edwin kilbourne chief of the health studies branch of the 
division of environmental hazards and health effects at the cdc 
said the outofstate cases raises the ante a bit 
kilbourne who planned to arrive in new mexico on monday said 
all agencies are being very cautious about making a connection 
between ltryptophan and the cluster of eosinophilia cases 
the problem is an epidemic association and as far as i am 
aware it is not very solid he said 
ms eidson said the new mexico and arizona patients suffered 
severe muscle pain and 10 were hospitalized she said today that 
one woman was still hospitalized early this week but she didnt 
know if the patient has since been released 
new mexico health officials have asked retailers to halt sales 
of ltryptophan 
dr gerald gleich of the mayo clinic said both the missouri and 
mississippi patients had taken ltryptophan 
the thing thats unusual is seeing so many patients with the 
same pattern gleich said its not like we havent seen the 
likes of this before whats different is there are so many at one 
time and theyre all taking ltryptophan 
dr leroy gomez director of the fda in denver said oregon also 
has reported two cases but he could provide no details except that 
one of the cases apparently involved ltryptophan he planned to 
contact the fda in seattle to investigate the oregon incidents

police arrested 1000 moslem protesters 
friday who tried to march to nearby ayodhya where celebrating 
hindus laid the foundation stone of a new temple at a site claimed 
by both religions 
the moslem demonstration was peaceful but zafaryab jilani one 
of its leaders declared when all these methods fail arms are 
taken up the next generation may not listen to peaceful protest 
at least 290 people have been killed in hindumoslem violence in 
three indian states since plans for the temple were announced in 
august no violence has been reported in faizabad or ayodhya 
protest leaders in faizabad accused prime minister rajiv gandhi 
and his congress party of giving in to hindu fundamentalists in a 
quest for hindu votes in national elections set for nov 22 24 an 
26 
if this ruling congress party is ousted from power perhaps 
secular government can be saved said jilani a senior leader of 
the allindia babri masjid action committee 
babri masjid the mosque of babar was built in the 17th century 
on the spot in ayodhya where hindu fundamentalists claim one of 
their most popular gods lord ram was born 
about 90 minutes after the arrests in faizabad hindus 
celebrated the laying of the foundation stone of a new ram temple 
130 feet from the babar mosque they flung marigold petals into a 
6footdeep hole in which their leaders reverently placed bricks 
and the stone 
police wearing helmets and chest protectors struggled to keep 
from falling into the pit as at least 5000 pilgrims pushed into 
the small hilltop enclave in less than an hour 
the dispute over the ayodhya hilltop in uttar pradesh state is 
centuries old and the current chapter began on a night in 1949 
when a ram idol was spirited into the mosque a court ordered the 
mosque closed to people of both faiths in an effort to prevent 
religious strife 
in 1986 another court order opened the babar mosque but only 
to hindus that decision prompted riots across india in which at 
least 200 people died 
currently the argument centers on who owns the land where the 
foundation is being laid hindus and moslems agree the small plot 
intended for the stone is owned by a hindu but the rest of the 
landed needed for the temple remains in dispute 
although moslems opposed construction of the temple they agreed 
they could not prevent the stone from being laid in the plot owned 
by a hindu 
late thursday night however moslem activists contended the 
foundation site was spilling over to property they claim is moslem 
courts in uttar pradesh state where gandhis congress party 
controls the government have declined to rule who owns the 
property 
after today moslems will not vote for congress mohammad 
azam khan an uttar pradesh state legislator from the opposition 
janata party said friday 
azam like jilani is a convenor a sort of senior organizer 
of the babri masjid action committee both were among those 
arrested in faizabad 
the arrests were part of a uniquely indian form of peaceful 
protest in which people do something they know police will not 
allow such as marching to ayodhya thus inviting arrest the 
police oblige by rounding them up generally with little or no 
force 
in faizabad the moslems and at least 40 hindu sympathizers 
climbed willingly into freighthauling trucks and waved as they 
were driven to a police compound on the outskirts 
at the compound they sat on the ground listening to leaders 
exhort them to preserve india as a secular state and vote gandhi 
and his party out of office 
moslems who make up 11 percent of indias 880 million people 
have given the congress party strong support since indias 
independence from britain in 1947 gandhi faces a tough challenge 
from vishwanath pratap singh leader of the national front 
coalition and the moslem vote could be pivotal

americans have lavished praise on 
president corazon aquino during her visit to the united states but 
at home she faces declining popularity 
from main street to wall street america loves the 
philippines president bush told mrs aquino at the white house 
on thursday and america loves cory aquino 
but a recent survey of 300 manila residents showed that only 35 
percent were satisfied with their president two years ago a 
survey by the same pollster the social weather stations indicated 
a 77 percent approval rating for mrs aquino 
bushs remarks were typical of the reception mrs aquino has 
received during her north american tour she arrived in canada on 
nov 4 and traveled tuesday to new york after washington she is 
to visit dallas and los angeles 
the attentive observer with an eye constantly cocked for 
exquisite ironies would not miss this one of apparent cheers for 
the president on foreign soil and tears and jeers on her home 
base wrote columnist rosario garcellano in the manila times 
columnist luis beltran traveling with mrs aquino noted the 
enthusiastic welcomes she has received from filipino expatriates in 
north america 
it is as if filipinos abroad are caught in a time warp 
beltran wrote in the manila standard 
national leaders often enjoy a more favorable image abroad than 
at home and mrs aquinos aides routinely dismiss criticism as the 
carpings of opposition groups jealous of power 
but even her supporters acknowledge growing public disaffection 
because of rising prices crime corruption lack of basic services 
and a failure to fulfill many of promises of the people power 
revolution that ousted ferdinand marcos and brought mrs aquino 
to power 
much of the dissatisfaction stems from economic problems 
despite a 6 percent economic growth inflation has reached more 
than 13 percent with the greatest increases in food 
the countrys electric power system is in such deplorable 
condition that the staterun national power corp has begun a 
system of twohour rotating brownouts throughout manila and luzon 
island to cope with the shortage 
public school teachers supreme court staffers and other 
government employees began a series of strikes this week over pay 
demands and delays in receiving promised salary differentials 
crime is widespread due in part to corruption within the police 
and armed forces there have been so many robberies of buses in 
western areas of mindanao island that the military has begun 
providing armed escorts for vehicles 
police say the crime rate between january and september was 14 
percent above the figure for all of last year more than 15 percent 
of all crimes reported took place in manila 
critics also claim mrs aquino tends to make grandiose promises 
without keeping them she promised justice to victims of a january 
1977 incident in which troops killed 12 protesters no one was ever 
charged in the incident after the commission she established to 
investigate effectively exonerated the troops 
the senior officer at the scene brig gen ramon montano was 
later promoted to major general and placed in command of the 
national police

the first of japans fourship whaling fleet left 
friday for the antarctic where officials say it will catch 300 of 
the mammals as part of a research program conservationists call 
commercial whaling in disguise 
the ship the nisshin maru no 3 will arrive in the antarctic 
ocean in december where it will be joined by three catcher boats 
said nobuyuki yagi a fishery agency official 
japan halted commercial whaling in the antarctic at the end of 
the 198687 season during which it caught 1941 whales it then 
began a program of research whaling which it says is aimed at 
assessing whale stocks 
japan killed 273 small minke whales a nonendangered species 
in the first year of the research program and 241 last year 
in 1986 the international whaling commission imposed a 
moratorium on commercial whaling to allow scientists to assess 
whale stocks without the disruption caused by regular whaling 
activities 
however under the organizations charter member nations are 
allowed to conduct research whaling whenever they wish 
the official said japan hopes its research will prove that 
enough of some species remain to allow a resumption of limited 
commercial whaling when the commissions moratorium comes up for 
review next year 
but judging from the current positions of the members of the 
commission it looks very unlikely that the ban will be lifted 
he said 
japanese whaling officials have said that at least 825 whales 
must be caught to make the research program scientifically 
accurate and the quota for the programs first year was initially 
875 but strong opposition from international environmental groups 
and other commission members led japan to reduce the quota to 300 
the meat obtained by the research program is sold for food as 
permitted under commission regulations 
at an annual meeting of the 38member commission in june japan 
also asked for special permission to catch 320 minke whales along 
its coast to alleviate the suffering of several whaling towns 
where it said 789 people have lost their jobs because of the ban 
the request was turned down by the commission 
japan is the worlds largest consumer of whale meat and 
officials say the food is an important part of the countrys 
culture 
in the early 1960s when japanese whaling was at its peak 
whales provided 23 percent of all meat consumed in the country 
since then declining whale supplies have turned it into a 
delicacy and the nisshin maru is the only remaining processing 
ship 
whaling officials say whales must be killed during the research 
to accurately determine their age sex diet and health but 
antiwhaling groups say nonlethal research methods are available 
such as skin sampling 
minke whales a smaller species are currently estimated by the 
iwc to number about 730000 yagi said 
norway and iceland also conduct research whaling but iceland 
has announced it will end its research whaling program at the end 
of this season

americans italians and others clambered up the 
berlin wall on friday to join germans from both sides of the divide 
in an exuberant celebration of east germanys newly opened borders 
ive seen this wall many times and im glad to see it break 
open said rick mike an american soldier who joined the hundreds 
atop the graffiticovered concrete barrier at the citys hallmark 
brandenburg gate 
it should have happened a long time ago this freedom thats 
what were here for said mike who is based in west berlin 
two jackbooted soviet soldiers standing guard at the massive 
soviet world war ii memorial less than 200 yards to the west of the 
wall watched impassively 
champagne bottles littered the base of the wall on the other 
side scores of unarmed east german soldiers some grim others 
bemused kept an eye on the throng on top of the barrier a nearby 
brass band drowned out shouts and the milling crowd paralyzed local 
traffic on the walls west side 
the celebrations began late thursday when communist authorities 
threw open east german borders for the first time since the berlin 
wall rose in 1961 on friday authorities said they would forever 
lift all travel restrictions and begin knocking down a portion of 
the wall 
mike 20 and another american soldier edward tolentino 23 of 
chicago said neither they nor the city had slept since the first 
wave of east germans began pouring into west berlin 
i worked midnight shift last night and im going to work 
midnight shift tonight and i dont think im going to get much 
rest in between said mike of waltham mass 
robert davidson a modern dancer from seattle said friends had 
told him of east germanys decision to permit its citizens 
unrestricted travel abroad and i still dont believe it 
i was sure the wall was here to stay at least till the turn of 
the century but the decision to permit free travel for east 
germans had now changed his mind he said 
sergio lauria of rome said he felt anticipation mixed with the 
joy of celebrants atop and near the wall 
people are waiting for something he said this thing is 
not over yet 
his neighbor giorgio puzzilli said he felt fortunate to be 
visiting berlin at this historic time 
this is a very important moment he said you have to feel 
for these people who have been waiting for such a long time 
jozsef dudas of miskolc hungary said he felt special empathy 
for the east germans 
if it werent for hungary this wouldnt have happened he 
said alluding to his countrys initial role in the exodus of east 
germans wanting to settle in west germany 
since hungary threw open its western border to austria sept 10 
to east germans wishing to turn their back on the east bloc more 
than 50000 of them have used hungary as a springboard to the west 
others have used czechoslovakia and poland 
at checkpoint charlie three miles down the wall officials lost 
count of how many east berliners had crossed into west berlin since 
the border was opened it must be tens of thousands said one 
west german border official early morning reports in west berlin 
spoke of about 50000 people 
east berlin construction workers still wearing their hard hats 
drank beer and toasted their first experience in west berlin 
watched by about 200 curious westerners 
there were jubilant scenes at other border crossings and east 
and west berliners joined in a neverending party they had been 
awaiting for decades 
the wall which has divided berlin and symbolized the division 
of east and west for decades was built to stop the flow of east 
germans fleeing to the west 25 million from 1949 until aug 13 
1961 
more than 20000 berliners gathered friday outside the 
schoeneberg city hall in west berlin where president john f 
kennedy proclaimed ich bin ein berliner on june 26 1963 
there are some who say that communism is the wave of the 
future let them come to berlin kennedy said and there are 
some who say in europe and elsewhere we can work with the 
communists let them come to berlin 
and there are even a few who say that its true that communism 
is an evil system but it permits us to make economic progress let 
them come to berlin 
freedom has many difficulties and democracy is not perfect 
but we have never had to put a wall up to keep our people in to 
prevent them from leaving us 
every president since has repeated kennedys plea to tear the 
wall down 
former west german chanellor willy brandt mayor of west berlin 
when the wall went up in 1961 said prospects for german unity had 
taken a major step forward with east germanys opening of its 
borders 
the berlin wall will come down and berlin will live brandt 
said

communist party leader todor zhivkov 
today stepped down after 35 years in power longer than any current 
eastern european leader in the latest upheaval in the soviet bloc 
zhivkov who molded bulgaria into one of the kremlins most 
loyal modern allies was replaced by foreign minister petar 
mladenov the news agency said 
zhivkov 78 also resigned from the ruling politburo and the 
partys policysetting central committee proposed that he be 
relieved of his post as state president the official bta news 
agency said 
mladenov 53 has been foreign minister since 1971 and is 
considered more open to reform than zhivkov 
the changes occurred at a central committee meeting 
during the meeting about 150 followers of the independent 
society for the protection of human rights held a rally in a nearby 
park the latest gathering by a growing proreform movement police 
vans were parked nearby but officers did not interfere 
zhivkov had been rumored to be on his way out for two years but 
diplomats and dissidents said the leadership change at this 
juncture was unexpected 
they said they had expected mladenov to be ousted from the party 
leadership because he had reportedly angered party hardliners by 
pushing to hold an international meeting in sofia last week an 
occassion that allowed independent groups to campaign publicly for 
reform 
although bulgaria had paid lipservice to reform the leadership 
has so far not implemented the kind of broad political reforms 
enacted in hungary and poland where the communists have 
significantly loosened their grip on power 
zhivkov gained ultimate power as communist party chief in 1954 
with the backing of bulgarian supporters of josef stalin the 
soviet dictator two years later he sided with nikita s 
khrushchev stalins successor and ideological foe 
dogmatic and conservative by temperament and training zhivkov 
displayed surprising ability in smoothing over party dissent to 
emerge with his leadership strenghtened 
he began consolidating his power upon assuming the leadership 
purging opponents and sending the most dangerous ones into exile 
by 1964 his authority was firm enough to survive an 
antikhrushchev backlash a year later he emerged unscathed from a 
conspiracy to remove him 
the brief bta dispatch said the central committee formally 
thanked him for his long selfless service to the party and the 
people 
it was latest development in a tumultuous year of social and 
political change in eastern europe 
on thursday east german leader egon krenz opened the berlin 
wall and other western borders the most breathtaking development 
in a threeweek whirlwind of reform in a country that was once so 
resistant to sovietstyle reforms 
zhivkovs resignation comes exactly one week after thousands of 
demonstrators rallied in the capital sofia in the first known 
proreform rally in postwar bulgaria 
bulgaria has long resisted the reforms introduced by soviet 
president mikhail s gorbachev but about a dozen small civil 
rights groups have formed in recent months 
zhivkov and other senior officials had pledged to work toward 
separating party and state functions and introducing a measure of 
democracy by ammending the constitution 
on friday a crowd estimated at up to 9000 took part in a 
demonstration that coincided with the last day of a 35nation 
conference on protection of the environment 
protesters reported chanted democracy and glasnost 
gorbachevs policy of openness 
no such demonstration has taken place in the bulgarian capital 
since the end of world war ii 
radio sofia reported today that the two main points on the 
meeting agenda were the development of economic restructuring in 
bulgaria and a preliminary discussion on preparing the 14th 
communist party congress scheduled in november 1990 
diplomats here say there is growing awareness that economic 
reforms badly needed to revamp a stagnating economy cannot be 
carried out without some political changes 
a report released by zhivkov before todays meeting acknowledged 
this 
the real problem is to specify what changes will be introduced 
in our political system in the structure and way of functioning of 
power as well as in the party by which we will move ahead the 
political reform and bring it into conformity with the 
restructuring of the socioeconomic and intellectual life he 
said

a unesco commission friday approved a program for 
the first half of the 1990s containing provisions on global 
communication and news distribution that are troubling to some 
western observers 
the united states and britain which pulled out of the un 
educational scientific and cultural organization in the mid1980s 
in part over antiwestern bias have said the agencys decisions on 
communications will play a major role in determining whether they 
return 
many old code words about protection of journalists and 
government licensing and censorship powers are gone from the 
proposed program but the plan sets up an adversary relationship 
between the media and the public by saying the public should be 
educated to avoid manipulation by the media 
it also reiterates the legitimacy of the new world information 
and communications order which western opponents regard as a 
threat to international reporting and news distribution 
dana bullen executive director of the world press freedom 
committee said there were some welcome things in the new 
program but unesco still has a way to go before it becomes a 
beacon for press freedom 
the head of the us observer mission richard t miller 
described the document as ambiguous and complex he said it would 
have to be reviewed before any decision on a us return to the 
organization after leaving it in 1985 british observers made 
similar comments 
miller said the proposed strategy did not resolve the 
controversy over the new world order but had positive references to 
the independence of media pluralism and diversity of opinion 
the two nations which between them provided 30 percent of 
unescos budget had charged that the organization had become 
antiwestern spent too much and was poorly managed 
unesco director general federico mayor of spain who took over 
as head of the troubled agency two years ago has been trying to 
remove references to this order from the communications program and 
take a new direction 
but the 50nation executive board where third world and east 
bloc nations have a majority have watered down mayors proposals 
and resurrected controversies on communications that have been 
debated at unesco since the 1970s 
canadian spokesman tom mcphail said mayor could be proud of the 
outcome because under his leadership freedom of the press has 
returned to the halls of unesco 
many media specialists maintain the concept of a new world 
information and communication order has become outmoded given the 
substantial progress in communications technology in the past 10 
years they said the way to remove imbalances is to strengthen the 
communications capabilities of developing countries 
but third world nations believe there still are imbalances in 
the flow of information to them with a dominant role for western 
media 
these nations led by senegal and yugoslavia succeeded in 
getting several references in the program to their charge that 
western media report about them in a false and distorted way 
the program was approved by consensus that is without a vote 
after three days and nights of lengthy sometimes tense debate 
it now goes before the general conference of the 161nation 
unesco which is expected to approve it next week before 
adjourning the conference is the agencys highest decision making 
body and meets every two years

an army of technicians working around the 
clock is repairing what was once the worlds largest oil refinery 
heavily damaged in the war with iraq and now playing a key role in 
irans reconstruction 
collapsed oilstorage tanks crumpled into rusting shapes miles 
of twisted pipes wrecked workshops and refining equipment 
peppered with shrapnel holes can be seen everywhere in the 
6squaremile abadan complex near the persian gulf 
the refinery was set on fire and burned for days at the start 
of the war when it was shelled by the iraqis from across the river 
and raided repeatedly by their planes said farzad oveisi 
abadans plant director 
oveisi boasted the refinery was partially reopened in april 
after a crash fivemonth repair program with no foreign help it 
is operating at about 40 percent capacity with 130000 barrels 
produced a day earning 12 million a month 
about 3000 people work at the complex that once employed 
12000 workers are laying more than 370 miles of new pipeline and 
have repaired 45 storage tanks 
we dont need any foreign assistance we have all the 
expertise necessary and our only need from abroad is specialized 
equipment he told foreign correspondents who visited abadan 
recently 
nonetheless tehran hotels are full of technical teams from 
europe and asia working on reconstruction projects worth billions 
of dollars 
president hashemi rafsanjani has ruled out direct us 
involvement but some west european companies with teams working on 
petrochemical and engineering projects are subsidiaries of 
specialist american firms 
before the war broke out in september 1980 abadan was the 
biggest refinery in the world with a capacity of 630000 barrels a 
day 
it was knocked out in the early days of the fighting when the 
iraqis besieged the city the refinery within rifle range of iraqi 
positions across the karoun river border was hammered repeatedly 
by artillery and air strikes 
the restoration of abadan was politically symbolic in the 
postwar rebuilding but it also eased the pressure on irans five 
other refineries all badly hit during the war 
with a postwar reconstruction bill likely to top 400 billion 
every dollar from irans vital oil industry counts oil income this 
year has been estimated at 12 billion 2 billion more than 
projected 
oil minister gholamreza aqazadeh estimated that oil revenue in 
the next five years will total 70 billion on top of that 
rafsanjani said last month he will seek up to 20 billion in 
foreign investment in a fiveyear plan expected to start next 
spring 
rafsanjanis move to encourage foreign financing marks an 
important ideological shift in tehran following the death of 
ayatollah ruhollah khomeini june 3 and the july 28 election of 
rafsanjani leader of irans socalled pragmatists 
radicals are opposed to foreign involvement because they fear it 
will dilute the islamic revolutions fundamentalist principles 
the level of foreign investment rafsanjani seeks subject to 
parliamentary approval is considered to be about the limit that is 
politically acceptable right now diplomats said 
rafsanjani has given top priority to the oil and gas industry 
with a major expansion of the gas sector primarily for export 
iran sits on top of an estimated 700 trillion cubic meters of gas 
the secondbiggest reserves in the world after the soviet union 
aqazadeh said last month the government will invest 134 
billion in foreign currency in the oil and gas sectors in the next 
five years several new refineries and major petrochemical plants 
are planned

suburban atlanta apartment complex today looking for clues to the 
crash of a navy jet fighter that exploded and slammed into the 
buildings leaving one man missing and feared dead 
four people were injured including the pilot of the a7e 
corsair ii who ejected just before the crash thursday evening and 
a pregnant woman and her 5yearold child who were critically 
burned 
all the people are accounted for except one occupant cobb 
county medical examiner joseph burton said today unfortunately 
were pretty sure hes in there four other people who had

earlier burton had said if there are no fatalities id call 
it somewhat of a miracle 
the unarmed a7e corsair ii crashed 2 miles short of the runway 
at navalair station atlanta 15 miles north of atlanta adjacent to 
dobbins air force base said navy spokesman kerry honore the pilot 
was attempting to land at the air station when the crash occurred 
at about 630 pm 
about 30 people at the pine hill village apartment complex were 
left homeless burton said the missing man was believed to be the 
sole occupant of an apartment but he said he could not rule out 
the possibility that a visitor also could have been with him 
my first officer on the scene said he heard screams but the 
building was engulfed in flames and he couldnt get in police 
lt jl martin said 
an initial sweep today looking for the missing man yielded 
nothing burton said at midmorning adding hes not where you 
can see him later smyrna fire chief larry williams said local 
search crews had yielded for the time being to military searchers 
who were looking mainly for clues 
the crash site remained sealed off with police tape and marine 
reserve guards police officer frank durrance who had been inside 
the complex said the navy jet struck the edge of a building before 
crashing into a car and coming to rest by a chain link fence about 
30 yards away 
its completely burned its just a big piece of metal 
the car was completely burned you could tell it was a car but you 
cant tell that it was a plane durrance said 
the navy today identified the pilot as reservist lt cmdr 
robert m conlyn jr of marietta a veteran pilot both for the 
naval reserve and delta air lines 
he underwent brain surgery at kennestone hospital on thursday

some slight improvement said hospital spokeswoman laurel 
fredlake 
a witness terry scott said he saw the pilots parachute deploy 
about 100 feet above the ground the pilot plunged into a street 
where he was given cardiopulmonary resuscitation 
i saw the plane pop and all the lights go off said charles 
feather a maintenance supervisor at an adjacent apartment complex

burning building 
i found the baby girl and she was burnt he said then i 
found the pregnant woman and the paramedics showed up

told him the fetus might not survive 
holly alfredson 24 was treated for cracked ribs she suffered 
while fleeing her apartment hospital officials said 
the commander of the naval air station capt peter hunt said 
today that he had no information on the cause of the crash a navy 
review board would study the wreckage and maintenance and pilot 
records he said 
the plane did not carry the black box flight recorder 
required on commercial airlines and hunt said air traffic 
controllers received no distress messages from the pilot 
the crash confirmed the worst fears of residents who hear 
military planes and helicopters roar above them daily 
im not surprised said tim head a resident of the damaged 
apartment complex not a week goes by that i dont think when 
is a jet going to crash here 
what i want to know is why they do maneuvers in such a 
populated area said tony clark who lives nearby 
military officials last year canceled performances by the blue 
angels stunt aircraft because of the concentration of businesses 
and residences near the base

former surgeon general c everett koop who 
sought a plainspoken campaign against aids while in office says 
its a mistake for homosexuals to mix the fight against the deadly 
disease with the politics of the homosexual rights movement 
in a health address and news conference thursday koop said that 
the plea for compassion and care for people with aids if it gets 
mixed up with the homosexual rights movement would fail 
koop who put the condom in the frontline of the aids battle 
declared in the beginning because aids was politicized we lost 
precious time and lives i hope hispanics and blacks dont make the 
same mistake 
the leaders of both those communities he urged should say 
publicly we have a number of people who through no fault of 
their own are sick and need our health care and sympathy they 
should not say we should be treated differently from anyone else 
black ministers koop declared should warn from their pulpits 
of the perils of unsafe sex and drugs 
it was inevitable that an aids antidiscrimination ordinance 
such as that repealed in concord this week would be unpopular 
said koop 
asked whether he supported aids antidiscrimination legislation 
he declined a direct answer saying thats a political issue 
not a public health issue 
but he added people who are sick deserve all the help and 
care they can get and shouldnt be discriminated against

east germany today said it was permanently lifting 
travel restrictions on its citizens and west germanys foreign 
minister said workers would begin knocking holes in the berlin wall 
to allow people to pass freely between the nations 
interior minister friedrick dickel said thursdays removal of 
travel restrictions was permanent 
the new travel regulation is not a temporary measure dickel 
told east german television it is permanent and will be the 
foundation of a new travel law 
foreign minister hansdietrich genscher of west germany told a 
crowd of about 20000 people outside west berlins city hall that 
holes would be made in the 9foothigh wall starting this evening 
a portion of the wall at the famed potsdamer platz will be torn 
down during the weekend genscher said at times his voice was 
drowned out by cheers from the crowd genscher said he was told of 
the plans by east german officials 
the announcements capped one of the most dramatic shifts in 
postwar europe giving the once pennedup east german people 
freedom of travel for the first time since the berlin wall was 
built in 1961 
east germany first opened its borders thursday but until today 
there had been some uncertainty about the scope of the move 
dickel said police and travel authorities had been instructed to 
expeditiously deal with all requests for trips abroad especially 
to the federal republic of germany west germany and to west 
berlin 
all efforts will be made to grant permission for travel or 
emigration the same day the request is received dickel said 
visas for private trips will be stamped in passports if they do 
not have passports and want to leave immediately their identity 
cards will be stamped said dickel 
tens of thousands of east germans streamed into west berlin and 
other parts of west germany today after a heady night of 
celebrating the opening of the berlin wall and other borders 
last night the germans were the happiest people in the 
world west berlin mayor walter momper said the party continued 
today as revelers popped champagne corks lit sparklers and 
embraced on both sides of the border 
west german chancellor helmut kohl cut short his visit to poland 
to meet with his cabinet and arrived in west berlin he hoped to 
talk with east german leader egon krenz 
krenz in a continuing effort to stop an exodus of east germans 
to the west today fired four more members of the ruling politburo 
and launched an investigation of gross mistakes made by the 
leadership under his predecessor erich honecker 
the politburo which normally has 21 members was streamlined to 
11 two days ago it lost one more full member today and three 
candidate or nonvoting members 
east germans began fleeing their communist homeland by the tens 
of thousands in september after hungary began dismantling its 
borders to the west and allowed east germans to pass through 
proreform demonstrations began spreading across east germany 
finally leading to the ouster oct 18 of the hardline leader 
honecker 
the abrupt opening of the border was the breathtaking climax of 
a remarkable series of reforms that began with krenzs appointment 
east and west berliners joined in dancing atop the berlin wall 
during the celebrations that lasted through the night more than 
50000 east berliners crossed into west berlin during the night 
said the west german radio station sender fries berlin only about 
1000 of them planned to stay the radio said 
most were just visiting exulting in their sudden new freedom to 
travel to the other side of the monolithic structure 
the sun is shining and the people are in a good mood said 
a smiling husky east german guard today at the invalidenstrasse 
crossing of the wall 
many people cried as they embraced relatives they hadnt seen in 
decades others rushed to west berlin department stores to buy 
cosmetics and other goods scarce in the east bloc 
it was so simple to come over one young east german said 
the feeling is just indescribable 
in bonn jubilant west german lawmakers many shaking with 
emotion spontaneously stood to sing the national anthem thursday 
during a hastily called session of the lower house of parliament 
president bush said if east germany makes good on its promise to 
allow free emigration this wall built in 61 will have very 
little relevance 
in moscow soviet foreign ministry spokesman gennady i 
gerasimov praised the east german reforms but cautioned that any 
speculation about a reunified germany was out of the question 
west germany should take into account that policies aimed at 
reconsidering borders would not suit any government in europe and 
would cause only mistrust gerasimov said 
the sight of people dancing atop the barrier that epitomized the 
cold war since it was built in 1961 was unthinkable only hours 
earlier some took hammers and chisels to the wall thursday night 
in a symbolic effort to tear it down 
hundreds of west berliners took advantage of the newly opened 
borders to head in the opposite direction and catch a glimpse of 
the other side of the divided city 
what joy this is the best thing that happened in 100 years 
yelled a west berlin man 
many hugged and kissed strangers while cars packed with east 
germans and others paraded down the streets of west berlin 
honecker supervised the building of the berlin wall before he 
became communist party chief every us president since john f 
kennedy has urged that it be torn down 
krenz on thursday also advocated a law that would ensure free 
and democratic elections in his communist nation which has been 
disrupted by proreform demonstrations and weakened by mass flight 
to the west 
more than 200000 east germans nearly 15 percent of the 
nations 165 million people have left so far this year 56000 
through czechoslovakia since saturday alone most are young 
skilled workers vital to the economy 
hundreds of thousands of people who stayed behind have filled 
the streets to demand democratic reforms and an end to 40 years of 
rigid oneparty rule 
an adn dispatch said a party conference planned for next month 
would consider personnel changes in the 163member central 
committee

suburban city are banding together against what they see as an 
unsightly enemy for sale signs which residents consider tacky 
the 11 clubs have decided to embark on a letterwriting campaign 
to persuade real estate agents to stop using the signs once 
unheard of in greenwich where george bush grew up and where many 
new york city corporate titans live 
garden club members say burglars may see the signs as hints the 
owners are absent they also worry that the signs hurt property 
values 
its the effect of a fire sale said nadine von storch a 
real estate broker and member of the hortulus garden club 
everything must go people get panicky why is everyone on north 
street selling their house 
one real estate agent david ogilvy said his firm simply wont 
stoop to using signs 
i think signs are very ugly ogilvy said i see people 
spending tons of money and time landscaping their yards beautifully 
to have it ruined by their nextdoor neighbor whose house is for 
sale for nine to 11 months and all you see is signs 
but tom gorin vice president of the 700member greenwich board 
of realtors said in a tough real estate market its very 
difficult to tell a homeowner that he cant use any means available

supporters of a new state policy to 
strengthen the teaching of evolution in the nations largest public 
school system say it was diluted to please religious 
fundamentalists 
but a minister said the new science education guidelines 
censored teaching of the biblical theory of the origin of life 
state superintendent of public instruction bill honig who 
helped write the guidelines said thursday they clearly say that 
evolution not creationism will be taught to californias 46 
million public school students 
this is a much stronger statement than was in place before 
honig said after the state board of education unanimously adopted 
the policy this now states for the first time evolution will be 
taught in its entirety and its not controversial 
the rev louis sheldon of the traditional values coalition an 
opponent of the policy said it censors creationism 
it isnt the states role to be hostile to religion sheldon 
said it is to be accommodating 
sheldon cited as particularly offensive the sentence in the 
policy that says the particular case of creation science or 
scientific creationism has been thoroughly studied and rejected 
by the leading scientific societies as qualifying as a scientific 
explanation 
the board of educations 90 vote sets up the guidelines only as 
recommendations to local school boards which mandate course 
content but such standards historically have influenced the local 
panels and textbook publishers throughout the nation 
the vote climaxed months of dispute the latest round in the 
long struggle between educators and civil libertarians over 
evolution vs creation 
honig maintained that the changes did not weaken the evolution 
language but michael hudson of the civil libertarian group people 
for the american way said the language leaves the door open to 
controversy 
the policy is a 90 percent victory for science he said 
it is frustrating that the state board of education was compelled 
to weaken the evolution coverage to appease the religious right 
eugenie scott executive director of the national center for 
science education said the policy is slightly weaker on 
evolution but remains a strong document overall that still says 
evolution is a fact 
the changes she said were a concession to christian 
fundamentalists that were necessary to gain board support for 
passage 
scott said that overall the new policy may be so much stronger 
on evolution that they shock teachers into ignoring the guidelines 
altogether she also said some textbook publishers may withdraw 
from the lucrative california market because of the costs of 
reorganizing their books 
specifically honig and board of education president francis 
laufenberg made the amendments by striking a sentence that said 
there is no scientific dispute that evolution has occurred and 
continues to occur this is why evolution is regarded as a 
scientific fact 
honig said the sentence was redundant within the document 
other changes include deletion of two paragraphs that contain 
references to a precedentsetting us supreme court decision and a 
national academy of science booklet that both question the 
scientific validity of the creationist theory 
several sentences were added that in part say some people 
reject the theory of evolution purely on the basis of religious 
faith and that such personal beliefs should be respected and 
not demeaned 
the old guidelines said evolution must be taught in schools and 
they offered no guidance to teachers or administrators on dealing 
with questions from students about the biblical theory of creation

petar mladenov who was named bulgarias 
communist party chief on friday is seen as a relative moderate 
whose views have at times raised the ire of hardliners in this 
communist country 
but in the past mladenov also spoke out against reforms 
demanded by polands solidarity movement and during a recent visit 
to china he cautioned against countries interfering in each others 
internal affairs 
mladenov was an unexpected candidate to replace todor zhivkov 
who resigned friday after 35 years in power 
diplomats and analysts said he had upset hardliners in the 
party leadership by pushing to hold an international conference in 
sofia under whose auspices independent groups were able to 
publicly campaign for reform 
mladenov 53 was born in 1936 in a village in northwestern 
bulgaria into a peasants family 
he studied philosophy at sofia university and graduated from the 
prestigious moscow state institute of international relations in 
1963 he joined the ruling party a year later 
a regional party secretary of the vidin county in northwestern 
bulgaria he quickly made his way up through party ranks and became 
a central committee member in 1971 he was appointed a full 
politburo member in 1977 
mladenov became foreign minister in 1971 when he was just 35 
making him not only the youngest foreign minister in bulgaria but 
also one of the youngest and longest serving chiefs of diplomacy in 
the soviet bloc 
diplomats said friday before the opening of a party plenum at 
which mladenov was appointed that they expected him to be ousted 
from the party leadership 
during last weeks international conference independent 
activists were joined by thousands of bulgarians who demonstrated 
in sofia for reforms 
mladenov was conspicuously absent from the head of a delegation 
that met last month with turkish officials to discuss the problem 
of ethnic turks in bulgaria bulgarian officials cited a heart 
ailment that mladenov reported has suffered from for years 
mladenov who toured many western countries in his long tenure 
as foreign minister including japan west germany and france was 
a supporter of eastwest disarmament talks but cautioned against 
reforms demanded by solidarity in poland in 1981 
during a visit to moscow that year he told reporters that we 
want to hope that the polish communists and healthy forces in the 
country will do everything necessary to defend communism 
poland banned the independent trade union movement and declared 
martial law the same year 
as part of sweeping reforms that have engulfed the soviet bloc 
solidarity was made legal this year and a solidarity member 
tadeusz mazowiecki became prime minister 
in an unmistakeable reference to the east bloc reforms mladenov 
said during a visit to beijing last week that interference in 
internal affairs aimed at imposing this or that model of 
development in all cases leads to destabilization and poses a 
threat to peace and security

poland said it understood chancellor 
helmut kohls decision to break off a visit friday after the 
dramatic opening of east germanys borders and officials tried to 
salvage the future of the trip 
the stunning developments in east germany were the main topic of 
talks when kohl met with prime minister tadeusz mazowiecki on 
friday and said he planned to go back to west germany according to 
kohl spokesman hans klein 
the prime minister showed understanding for the decision of 
the chancellor to cut short his visit klein said adding that 
kohl wanted to do everything to create the impression that west 
german interest in poland had not decreased 
kohl has bigger problems and everybody must understand that 
it would have been politically unwise for him not to return said 
jerzy osiatynski head of the central planning office 
government spokeswoman malgorzata niezabitowska said kohl told 
mazowiecki that he needed to break the sixday visit for about 24 
hours to go to berlin and bonn 
making light of the events sweeping eastern europe a senior 
government official remarked kohl will be back if germany 
doesnt reunify in the meantime 
klein said kohl was planning to return saturday night and would 
travel to the silesian town of krzyzowa to attend a roman catholic 
mass with mazowiecki ethnic germans also are planning to gather 
there 
despite the departure the two sides managed to sign six 
agreements 
the documents include the important investment promotion and 
protective agreement which provides west german guarantees for 
private enterprise investments in poland the economic assistance 
amounted to about 15 billion in two years including a 250 
million loan to help stabilize the zloty 
mazowieckis government says massive western economic aid is 
needed to secure the fragile democratic process under way 
west germany is polands largest western trading partner and 
kohl brought a delegation of businessmen with him to start 
developing projects between the two countries 
on thursday the nations agreed to establish consulates in 
hamburg and krakow and to extend contacts between their foreign 
ministries 
foreign minister krzysztof skubiszewski said his talks with west 
german foreign minister hansdietrich genscher had been very 
good and all the bilateral issues had been resolved before the 
east german developments propelled the talks to an international 
level 
thousands of east germans streamed into west berlin late 
thursday after the decision by east berlin to open border 
crossings and a massive and emotional street party continued 
through the night 
solidarity leader lech walesa told pap that the changes in east 
germany should have been taken much earlier 
the drama of the events in east germany is the result of 
earlier neglect as usually happens when someone misses the train 
of history walesa said 
the developments in east germany have fueled polish fears about 
german reunification and forced longsimmering border issues to the 
forefront of kohls visit which was intended to move the former 
world war ii adversaries closer to reconciliation

a soviet spokesman friday welcomed east germanys 
decision to throw open its borders and said it would help stem 
emigration and do away with stereotypes about the iron curtain 
foreign ministry spokesman gennady i gerasimov said the soviet 
union was concerned about the instability brought on by the mass 
exodus of east germans to the west 
but now that travel will be easier he said the wanderlust 
the germans are famous for will go down because now when you know 
you can go maybe youll postpone the decision 
gerasimov stressed that the border between east and west germany 
remained in force and the eased travel restrictions should not be 
taken as heralding the imminent reunification of the two germanys 
the border still remains though some might think it ceased to 
exist he said 
east german communist officials said later friday they were 
permanently lifting travel restrictions on their citizens and would 
begin taking down a portion of the 28yearold berlin wall 
now that the wall has lost its significance as a physical and 
symbolic barrier it removes all the stereotypes about the iron 
curtain gerasimov said 
foreign minister eduard a shevardnadze also welcomed the move 
saying it was a reasonable and sensible decision 
the soviet union had nothing to do with the decision to open the 
berlin wall gates shevardnadze told reporters covering his meeting 
with visiting swedish foreign minister sten andersson 
shevardnadze told andersson that some west german leaders are 
making statements against the postwar setup and stability in 
europe said tass the official news agency 
the ussr and sweden are resolutely in favor of the 
inviolability of the european borders tass said 
in the first press commentary on the east german move veteran 
tass political observer yuri kornilov called the border opening 
positive and important but ridiculed speculation that 
reunification of the germanys was at hand 
western claims that the borders will be redrawn in europe are 
strange postulates in my view he wrote yes the berlin wall 
has stopped being an obstacle isolating east german citizens from 
the western world but the move does not mean the removal of such 
border functions as customs inspections he emphasized 
gerasimov cited a nov 1 statement by east german leader egon 
krenz that the border exists due to other reasons and not for 
the purpose of interfering with contacts between people 
krenz noted then that the berlin wall marks the division between 
political systems as well as between the military alliances of east 
and west 
gerasimov said the border opening was part of the wide 
democratization of life taking place in east germany where the 
recent replacement of hardline communist leader erich honecker 
touched off a popular rush toward reform 
east berliners streamed into west berlin after east germany 
opened its borders thousands of east germans also crossed into 
west germany 
soviet tv in its nightly news broadcast vremya showed 
people cheering as they left east germany at several border points 
including checkpoint charlie at the berlin wall 
shevardnadze said he was undisturbed by the tens of thousands of 
east germans fleeing westward 
its not abnormal for people to leave their countries 
sometimes they return he said twenty thousand people leave 
the soviet union every year that in itself is not unusual 
in fact officials say more than 100000 people mainly jews 
armenians and ethnic germans have emigrated from the soviet union 
this year and some 2 million gone on visits in an outflow made 
possible by eased emigration restrictions 
however emigration is still limited by a variety of 
restrictions and complications as well as wouldbe emigres 
difficulties in finding promising countries willing to accept them 
a bill before the soviet legislature would grant most citizens 
the right to come and go as they please but it would still require 
an invitation from abroad for people who want to emigrate

chinese who fled their country after the june 
crackdown on the prodemocracy movement said friday that 
international disgrace forced chinese leader deng xiaoping to 
resign 
deng 85 gave up the chairmanship of the communist partys 
central military commission on thursday and was replaced by his 
chosen successor and communist party chief jiang zemin 
the resignation of deng appears to us as the necessary 
result of the june 4 massacre the parisbased federation for 
democracy in china said in a statement issued friday 
the federation founded by exiled chinese dissidents said dengs 
resignation proved the government is unstable though he is 
believed to retain a dominant political role 
in the face of criticism from the chinese people from the 
people of the whole world and from democratic governments deng 
xiaoping understood he could no longer remain head of the military 
commission the statement said 
deng met former us secretary of state henry kissinger in 
beijing on friday reinforcing the general feeling that deng 
remains a powerful figure 
in tokyo japanese government officials said dengs resignation 
will cause little change in chinas domestic and international 
policies 
foreign minister taro nakayama and finance minister ryutaro 
hashimoto said japan wont change its policy before chinas new 
leaders articulate their positions 
the important thing is that we should maintain our stand not 
to isolate china chief cabinet secretary mayumi moriyama told a 
news conference 
muneyoshi date a china specialist at takushoku university told 
the nationally circulated asahi shimbun newspaper that deng would 
control zemin who is inexperienced in military affairs although 
deng resigned from his last post thats not a real resignation 
date said 
it will be impossible for china to avoid the wave of democracy 
brewing in eastern europe and the soviet union said the nihon

president bush today proposed a 42 billion 
package to help the poor buy houses and the homeless receive 
shelter and vowed to change the destructive practices that 
have blocked affordable housing in inner cities 
bush did not suggest ways to pay the federal share of the 
threeyear program which would begin in the fiscal year starting 
next october 
he announced the package called home ownership and opportunity 
for people everywhere and entailing federal programs tied to state 
and local matching funds in a speech for the national association 
of realtors 
it would include 21 billion in grants to help residents of 
lowincome housing buy their units 
bush proposed a 50percent match of federal funds by state and 
local governments or nonprofit organizations the grants would be 
used to rehabilitate and purchase units in public housing vacant 
and foreclosed properties held by the government and distressed 
properties cited by the federal housing authority 
bush also offered incentives to local communities that remove 
bureaucratic barriers blocking the availability of affordable 
housing such as zoning restrictions 
he would give 210 million in insurance and rental 
rehabilitation grants for zones that best develop plans to remove 
such tax and regulatory barriers in inner city areas 
we will change the destructive practices which have kept fha 
out of the inner cities and distressed communities that most need 
its support he said he assigned housing and urban development 
secretary jack kemp to name a panel that would recommend ways to 
remove barriers to affordable housing 
no city state or town should receive a single penny of hope 
funding until they have identified the barriers to affordable 
housing in their own back yard and start taking steps to remove 
them bush said 
he said the centerpiece of his hope plan was to recapture the 
american dream of home ownership for those who have been left 
behind 
he also proposed 
728 million in federal housing funds to be matched at the 
state and local level for new housing and support services for the 
homeless 
108 billion to help tenant groups buy and convert federally 
subsidized buildings to residentowned cooperatives 
allowing firsttime buyers to use individual retirement 
accounts for a home down payment without paying a penalty 
44 million for a demonstration project that would offer 
housing and support services for elderly people who otherwise would 
have to be institutionalized 
hud officials said the state and local matching funds would add 
17 billion in assistance 
bush also was attending a dinner to help texas gov bill 
clements retire 2 million in debt from his 1986 campaign and 
helping dedicate a texas memorial to vietnam veterans before flying 
home saturday 
in a speech last march 14 bush said when you look out the 
window of the white house and see the ragged pathetic figures 
huddled over the steam grates of the ellipse i see an affront to 
the american dream a national shame 
he ordered kemp then to come up with new ideas to get the 
homeless off the streets of urban america 
earlier in the year bush proposed spending 644 million in 
fiscal 1990 to carry out the mckinney act a program created to 
find housing for the homeless 
president ronald reagan was often criticized by homeless 
activists for not seeking more funds for the homeless federal 
funds for lowincome housing were cut 75 percent during the reagan 
administration 
district of columbia officials believe there are 8000 to 10000 
people living on the streets of the nations capital nationally 
some researchers estimate 300000 to 600000 americans are homeless 
on any given night some activists say the homeless number 2 
million or more 
hud has been enveloped in an influencepeddling scandal left 
over from the reagan years and kemp has devoted most of his energy 
to date to straightening out his departments procedures for 
dispensing grants and contracts

iran friday reiterated the us release 
this week of 567 million in frozen iranian assets wont affect the 
status of americans held hostage in lebanon 
tehran television reported eftekhar jahroomi legal adviser to 
iranian president hashemi rafsanjani rejected any link because the 
us decision monday complied with a usiranian claims commission 
in the hague set up in 1981 after talks in algiers 
the payment was solely in line with the algiers agreements 
jahroomi was quoted as saying by the broadcast monitored in 
cyprus irans claims against american banks were similarly 
paid 
nowbari heirani irans representative at the international 
court also said the released assets have nothing to do with the 
hostages the report said 
deputy foreign minister mahmoud vaezi said thursday repayment of 
the assets had nothing to do with good will 
president bush said tuesday he hoped the us move will prompt 
iran to obtain freedom for the eight american hostages in lebanon 
the state department said the decision itself was not influenced by 
the hostage issue 
rafsanjani leader of the socalled pragmatists in iran told a 
news conference last month iran would help secure the release of 
the 18 western hostages held by proiranian groups in lebanon if 
washington unblocks iranian assets 
iran claims the assets frozen a decade ago are as much as 12 
billion including the value of weapons purchased before the 1979 
islamic revolution but never delivered 
the assets were blocked after militants stormed the us embassy 
in tehran nov 4 1979 and held american diplomats and other 
personnel hostage fiftytwo captives were released 444 days later 
the longestheld hostage in lebanon is terry anderson chief 
middle east correspondent for the associated press who was 
kidnapped march 16 1985

old soldiers worry about being turned out 
to the street a program intended to help homeless veterans 
allegedly milked them instead and the state says it has no money 
to stop the battleship uss massachusetts from turning into a rust 
bucket 
this veterans day its tough being a vet in massachusetts the 
problems relate one way or another to money in a state facing a 
projected 730 million budget deficit 
they say veterans day is to really honor the veterans and the 
deceased veterans said mark kelley 66 who served as an army 
staff sergeant in world war ii and now lives at the chelsea 
soldiers home 
but he added what theyre doing to us here is not even in 
the ballpark of the word honor 
state figures estimate massachusetts is home to 666000 military 
veterans including 170000 from the vietnam war era 121000 who 
served during the korean war 259000 from world war ii and about 
3000 who served in world war i 
about 500 of them live at the state home for wartime veterans 
which opened in 1882 and is believed to be the first such 
institution in the country 
since july gov michael dukakis administration has announced 
1435000 in cuts from the homes 164 million budget but the 
legislature has moved to restore the money 
the budget reduction threatens the home with severe cutbacks 
jan 1 in its medical services and some residents read this as an 
omen that it will be shut down altogether said kelley who heads 
the residents council 
kelley moved to the home in 1985 when two heart attacks 
compelled his retirement at age 62 
my feeling is the same as practically every other veteran in 
the place he said we do not have anywhere to go if they close 
this home 
similar budget cuts are threatened for the soldiers home in 
holyoke and its 262 residents 
another casualty of the money shortage is the uss massachusetts 
berthed in fall river and operated as a state memorial by a private 
charitable committee the world war ii battleship was to be towed 
to boston this weekend for 6 million in repairs but the project 
was aborted last week after state money was withdrawn 
in boston something is apparently rotten in the homeless 
veterans reintegration project 
two officials of the federally financed staterun project were 
suspended without pay last month while the attorney generals 
office looks into allegations they charged illegally high rents and 
accepted finders fees from landlords 
thomas hudner state deputy commissioner for veterans services 
whose agency sponsors the project acknowledged in an interview 
this week there are a lot of people who are embarrassed about 
the thing 
in any event he said i feel comfortable that there has been 
no diminishment of the services 
at the soldiers home 101yearold alma bloom explained the 
need for such services from the perspective of a world war i navy 
nurse who joined the homes staff in 1948 and became a resident 
about 10 years ago 
veterans deserve good care mrs bloom said while she 
sympathizes with the need to save money she said veterans 
should come first 
her daughter a 69yearold air force retiree also named alma 
and part of a lineage of veterans going back to the american 
revolution was more direct 
were no different than the blind or the abused children and 
other services that deserve not to be cut miss bloom said 
take a look out there miss bloom said nodding toward her 
fellow residents people with their legs cut off in wheelchairs 
shuffling along with canes

a courtapproved agreement permits a gun 
dealer to sell to police officers a 17 million shipment of 
semiautomatic rifles impounded under a bush administration ban nine 
months ago 
gun south incs shipment of 1252 steyr augsa semiautomatic 
rifles was seized by customs at the birmingham airport in march 
leading to one of the first court challenges to the government 
moratorium on imports of such weapons 
under the agreement approved thursday by us district judge 
william acker the dealer can sell the impounded rifles plus 3000 
more steyrs awaiting shipment austria but the sales can be made 
only to officers or law enforcement agencies the dealer had 
planned to sell them to hunters 
im glad its all over our legal bill is astronomical said 
gun south owner don wood he said friday the rifles sell for 1375 
each he said he cannot order more of the rifles because of the 
ban which remains on the books 
the agreement cancels a nov 21 trial of gun souths lawsuit 
challenging the ban 
james c barton a lawyer for gun south said he is convinced 
the trussville company has the right under law to import freely any 
number of steyr rifles and sell them to anyone but the financial 
burden required a settlement 
gun south sole us importer and distributor of steyrs ordered 
and committed to pay for the two shipments months before the bush 
administration announced a temporary ban on imports of 
semiautomatic rifles in march 
the ban came in response to public outcry over use of assault 
rifles in crimes including the shooting at a school in california 
in january 
the customs service impounded the first gun south shipment at 
the airport before gun south could pick it up and the company went 
to court seeking an order to release the guns 
gun south argued the gun was not an assault rifle and had 
received government approval for importation previously as suitable 
for hunting

a government spokesman friday accused pentagon 
officials of trying to spoil superpower relations by charging that 
soviet ships in the pacific shot lasers at us military aircraft 
rightwing forces in the united states are seeking to poison 
the atmosphere of the two countries relations by fanning up some 
insignificant scandal said foreign ministry spokesman gennady i 
gerasimov 
he told a news briefing the scandal was timed to sour president 
mikhail s gorbachevs summit with president bush next month on 
ships in the mediterranean sea off malta 
us defense department officials said thursday the soviets were 
suspected of shooting lasers at four us military aircraft in the 
pacific in recent weeks damaging the eyesight of an air force 
crewman in one incident 
lasers are sometimes used as rangefinders to target enemy 
aircraft 
the pentagon officials said the actions occurred despite an 
agreement last summer by us and soviet military officials 
designed to avoid such dangerous military encounters the agreement 
is not due to go into effect until jan 1 
defense department sources said it had not been officially 
determined that lasers had been used but that they were suspected 
because of past incidents and accounts from american military 
personnel 
gerasimov said nothing actually happened but even if 
something happened us defense department people could have 
obtained necessary clarification through regular channels 
the afflicted us crewman a loadmaster aboard an hc130 
aircraft suffered disruption of his color vision headaches and 
other visual problems and is under medical evaluation pentagon 
sources said 
the crewman had been wearing laser eye protection gear at 
the time and us officials are also investigating why the damage 
could occur despite that equipment the sources said

anticastro extremist orlando bosch is tired of 
jail and will give up his fight against government efforts to 
deport him relatives said 
he doesnt want to prolong the anguish after two years of 
this said boschs wife adriana 
bosch has 50 days to appeal a judges ruling wednesday that 
upheld the government decision to deport him but if he notifies 
the government in writing that he wont appeal he could be 
deported as soon as the state department can find a country to 
accept him 
he feels that to appeal would be giving his approval to the 
judicial limbo in which he has been kept mrs bosch said 
thursday 
boschs attorneys say theyll give him some time to reconsider 
before notifying the government that he wont appeal 
bosch 63 has been at the metropolitan correctional center 
since feb 16 1988 when he flew to miami from venezuela he spent 
11 years in venezuelan prisons on charges he masterminded the 
bombing of a cuban jetliner in 1976 that killed 73 people 
bosch never was convicted of those charges but the us 
attorney general office maintained that his anticastro activities 
make him a threat to national security 
immigration experts say it will be difficult for the government 
to find a country that will accept bosch who would likely be 
accompanied by his wife a justice department spokesman refused to 
comment other than to restate the governments promise not to send 
bosch to cuba where a death sentence awaits him 
the pending deportation provoked anger among miamis exile 
community many of whom regard bosch as a tireless campaigner 
against cuban leader fidel castro

surprising numbers that turned up in 
verifying the vote count for yonkers mayor cast doubt on results of 
a bitter election won by an opponent of courtordered housing 
desegregation officials said friday 
with five of the citys 12 wards recounted in the official 
canvass democratic incumbent nicholas wasicsko had picked up 1663 
votes cutting by more than a third the margin by which he trailed 
republican henry spallone 
this makes it close and there is a possibility the results 
could change said marion oldi one of two westchester county 
elections commissioners 
the canvass was suspended friday for veterans day and was to 
resume monday 
commissioner antonia dapice said the error discovered thursday 
was unnerving because of its size but that she considered a 
reversal unlikely 
wasicsko acknowledged the chance was remote but obtained a 
court order to have the remaining machines impounded under state 
police guard 
the whole direction of the city hangs in the balance the 
mayor said 
the race for city hall was a pivotal one for yonkers a city of 
195000 on the hudson river north of new york where a 
courtordered housing desegregation plan has divided the city for 
years the election was basically a referendum on the issue with 
spallone urging continued defiance and wasicsko calling for 
compliance 
in addition the mayor will be the seventh vote on a city 
council that apparently shapes up as evenly divided on the issue 
theres always a possibility i might wake up and not be mayor 
of yonkers but i think the numbers will hold spallone said 
everythings in the hands of the lord 
unofficial election night tallies had spallone defeating 
wasicsko by 4466 votes 29025 to 24559 vote totals generally 
change slightly in the official canvass that verifies the voting 
machine tallies phoned in from the polling places tuesday night

increases in leukemia among young people living 
near nuclear plants are not caused by exposure to radiation said a 
study released friday 
researchers found that death rates from leukemia and hodgkins 
disease among young people were about as high in areas that were 
only considered for nuclear plants as in areas that actually 
contained nuclear plants 
hodgkins disease is a cancer of the lymph glands researchers 
said it has never been linked to radiation exposure 
the cause of heightened cancer rates found in the study remains 
a mystery 
but the researchers said their findings indicate an increased 
risk of leukemia is not associated with exposure to radiation with 
the possible exception of the sellafield nuclear reprocessing plant 
on englands northwest coast 
the sellafield plant has been plagued by radioactive leaks 
government studies have found a 10fold increase in childhood 
leukemia a mile from the plant and concluded the plant is linked 
to the disease 
in the study released friday researchers from the medical 
research council and the imperial cancer research fund said the new 
findings suggest that areas near existing and potential nuclear 
sites might share unrecognized risk factors other than 
environmental radiation pollution 
dr sarah darby of the imperial cancer research fund said the 
findings point to something possibly in the lifestyle of the 
young but at the present time we dont have a great deal of handle 
on it 
the researchers investigated death statistics in 400 districts 
of england and wales near existing or potential nuclear sites the 
results were published in the the lancet a weekly medical journal 
excess mortality due to leukemia and hodgkins disease in 
young people who lived near potential sites was similar to that in 
young people who lived near existing sites researchers wrote 
ms darby said there was a 16 percent increase in childhood 
leukemia mortality in areas near nuclear installations compared 
with the rest of the country after adjusting for factors such as 
urbanrural status when the same analysis was carried out for 
areas near potential installations there was a 14 percent 
increase 
we carried out this study because estimates of radiation 
received by children living near nuclear installations are 
extremely low and it has been suggested that increases in the 
number of deaths are not caused by the presence of the 
installations but by some other feature of the districts in which 
they tend to be built she said 
the new findings on leukemia bolster this hypothesis the 
researchers wrote other previous theories such as those involving 
exposure to radon gas or viruses could not account for all the 
excess cancers in young people they said 
ms darby said the study also would disprove stress or 
psychosomatic illness being a possible cause since most people 
living around the potential sites wouldnt have been worried 
about it 
she said the main theory that needs investigation is that 
people who are exposed less frequently to infection very early in 
life are at a slightly higher risk of leukemia later on 
mel greaves of the leukemia research fund who originated the 
theory has biological reasons for thinking that is the case 
she said 
our data support that she said explaining that areas with 
a higher proportion of people in the upper social classes had a 
slightly higher risk of leukemia than people in areas with a higher 
proportion of manual workers

for decades politicians in bonn 
dreamed of embracing east germans in the free west now chancellor 
helmut kohl has rushed back from warsaw to consider whether the 
flood of humanity could turn the dream into a nightmare 
in one of the most dramatic shifts in postwar europe the 
communist east german government has thrown open the berlin wall 
and also let people cross through the heavily fortified borders 
into west germany 
the joy of those who came through by foot and car and even on 
sleek skateboards only temporarily deflected attention from a 
suddenly volatile central europe 
on the human level there is the question of what do with the 
200000 east germans who already have poured into west germany to 
say othing of the 1 million more that some have predicted may swamp 
one of europes most densely populated countries 
mayor walter momper of west berlin told a session of the upper 
house of parliament the east german newcomers will keep causing 
large and weighty problems for west germans 
but if we never forget the suffering caused by the berlin 
wall and if we keep recalling the happy faces and joy of 
yesterday we can master this challenge together momper said 
speaking the day after the borders were thrown open 
after breaking off a politically sensitive trip to poland kohl 
planned an emergency meeting of the cabinet to map the countrys 
strategy at issue is how to proceed both at home and in regard to 
the breakneck pace of changes in east germany 
from a military standpoint the two nations remain at the 
forefront of still officially hostile military alliances west 
germany is the base for 250000 us troops while nearly 400000 
soviet troops are based in east germany 
the military element is vital to the increasingly frequent 
predictions the latest shifts and uncertainty in east germany will 
lead to a german reunification 
neither washington nor moscow is likely to give up completely 
its frontline ally any time soon and german neutrality is a risk 
that many in west germany are unlikely to take 
still says conservative west german lawmaker eduard lintner 
reunification is coming closer but i cant say whether it will 
take 10 15 or 20 years we have the impression that things are 
much more concrete than we could have imagined five years ago 
any move toward reunification would cause unease and perhaps 
resistance in the soviet union france britain and some other 
european countries 
a reunified germany also would mean an enormous financial 
sacrifice for west germany as tax money from bonn flowed eastward 
to modernize increasingly outmoded factories and to clean up some 
of europes worst pollution 
perhaps as an interim measure kohl increasingly has been 
demanding democratic reforms in east germany in direct exchange for 
bonns financial aid to keep east germans from leaving in droves 
kohl said while still in warsaw that west germany could be 
ready to offer significant economic aid if the will to reform 
manifested itself in east germany 
at times it seems that kohl talks less and less about actual 
reunification the more the topic goes from a nostalgic dream into 
the realm of serious discussion 
kohl and his top aides also have increasingly been painting a 
bleak picture for the east germans who might want to come over it 
is another sign of growing stress for the government the strapped 
social services and problems such as lack of housing for the 
newcomers 
every refugee must figure that he will have to live in 
inadequate housing for a fairly long time and will probably be 
living much worse than if he had stayed home interior minister 
wolfgang schaeuble told parliament thursday 
schaeuble repeated the same warning the following day although 
claiming the east germans still are welcome

this tobacco town now has the states 
toughest ban on smoking thanks to a pregnant woman who grew tired 
of having smoke blown in her face at a neighborhood grocery store 
people dont have the right to pump poison in me said 
attorney pete clary who voted for the controversial referendum 
which passed by only 173 votes out of nearly 30000 cast in 
tuesdays election 
while greensboro may not be on the scale of nearby winstonsalem 
or durham in terms of tobacco production it is still a tobacco 
stronghold lorillard inc which makes newport kent and true 
cigarettes is one of the citys major employers with 2300 workers 
in this town of nearly 200000 people 
we dont feel like its going to stop here said earl 
jaggers a union leader at the lorillard plant these people 
antismoking proponents are going to move on to other cities and 
states 
the city council could enact the ordinance within two weeks 
putting smoking bans in elevators and large retail stores and 
nosmoking sections in most restaurants 
otherwise if both sides agree the referendum would go into 
effect jan 1 to give the restaurants and other public places time 
to prepare 
the ordinance the toughest in any north carolina city requires 
restaurants seating 50 or more to set aside at least 25 percent of 
their seats for nonsmokers 
it seems like a painful pill to swallow until everything gets 
worked out said david hudgins spokesman for the group which 
pushed the referendum 
were not saying dont smoke he said friday were 
saying dont expect me to have to breathe your smoke 
lori faley is credited with starting the referendum after she 
could do nothing about shoppers smoking in the checkout line at 
her neighborhood supermarket 
mrs faley who has since moved to wisconsin did not return 
phone calls friday 
she backed off from being in the forefront after she received 
some threats and comments hudgins explained ive received 
some threats too 
it took someone with courage to speak out hudgins said 
prior to the vote she told a local newspaper she was frustrated 
with trying to get businesses and restaurants to impose voluntary 
restrictions 
i tried that almost a year and a half ago when i went to 
grocery stores and asked them to impose their own bans she 
said they just kind of looked at me funny 
i asked some restaurants and they said we cant enforce it 
because theres no ordinance so why dont you get an ordinance 
mrs faley said 
so mrs faley and others formed gasp for greensboro to 
alleviate smoking pollution volunteers collected 7300 signatures 
calling for the referendum 
the penalty for lighting up in a designated nonsmoking area is 
25 for each offense no penalties will be imposed in the first 
year however 
theres so many families for which tobacco is their 
livelihood said donnie prago the owner of the restaurant 
donnies what we need is a generation or two in which the 
kids dont go into tobacco 
with 14000 tobacco farmers the tar heel state produces about 
twothirds of the nations fluecured tobacco which is valued at 
900 million annually fluecured tobacco is used to make 
cigarettes and north carolinas cigarette makers produce 56 
percent of all domestic brands 
before tuesdays vote an organization calling itself 
greensboro citizens for fairness mailed out 55000 brochures to 
residents asking them to vote against the ordinance 
the group was funded by lorillard rjr nabisco in winstonsalem 
and other cigarette manufactures according to rjr spokeswoman 
betsy annese 
lorillard vice president alexander spears became the chief 
spokesman for the group fighting the ban opponents do not plan to 
challenge the results of the vote spears said 
i still believe a voluntary approach is the better one 
spears said i believe restaurant owners need to have more 
flexibility than the ordinance mandates 
the referendum also will help antismoking campaigns elsewhere 
he said 
i am sure they will try to use this as a political plum and a 
reason for other communities to follow suit and that sort of 
thing he said 
spears said he had spent most of wednesday trying to calm irate 
employees who felt betrayed by voters in a city where the tobacco 
company has always worked hard to build a reputation as a good 
neighbor 
theres a feeling that the community was not supportive of 
them as individuals spears said generally theres a great 
feeling of disappointment in the community particularly in those 
segments of the community where the referendum was so 
overwhelmingly voted for

the white house is considering a highrisk 
move to temporarily bypass the senate confirmation process by 
giving recess appointments to a number of presidential 
nominations 
white house officials said recommendations are being prepared 
for president bush outlining the process for such a parliamentary 
endrun 
that the white house is even considering such a move reflects 
frustration by bush and his top aides over the senates slow pace 
in acting on his nominations 
however the action would be certain to further inflame already 
strained relations between bush and senate majority leader george 
mitchell dmaine 
under the constitution the president can temporarily sidestep 
the senates confirmation powers by appointing a person to fill a 
vacancy while the senate is in recess those named during congress 
upcoming winter break could hold their jobs through the end of 1990 
without senate confirmation 
some of the 119 nominations now pending before the senate have 
been controversial 
for instance bushs choice of james cason for a top agriculture 
department post has drawn fierce opposition from environmentalists 
and many senators for what they allege to be a prodevelopment bias 
the nomination of john m walker a cousin to bush to be a 
federal appeals judge in new york has been snarled in a nepotism 
charge walker is now a us district judge in new york 
victor stello jrs nomination as assistant secretary of energy 
for defense programs has been stalled since july over criticism of 
his record at the nuclear regulatory commission 
some ambassadorial appointments have been blocked by senate 
democrats who claim they have few qualifications other than large 
contributions to republican campaigns 
also among the pending nominations are richard g austin as head 
of the general services administration barbara everitt bryant as 
director of the census bureau brian w clymer as urban mass 
transportation administrator michael paul gavin as assistant 
secretary of commerce and a host of ambassadorial and judicial 
appointments 
a recess appointment might come back to haunt the officeholder 
when the grace period expired 
and there are other ways that congress can make its will felt 
if the recess appointee wanted to get paid it might be a 
problem said an official in the senate parliamentarians office 
who spoke on the condition of anonymity 
federal law requires bush to formally resubmit nominations of 
any recess appointments once a new session of the senate begins in 
order for the official to get his or her paycheck 
chase untermeyer white house personnel director said thursday 
he is preparing recommendations for bush on the possible use of 
recess appointments this year ive done it on my own without 
direction of the president or the chief of staff john sununu 
said untermeyer 
however he added ive not been told to stop 
another white house official who spoke on the condition of 
anonymity said were not anxious to do this this is only a 
last resort but it is something we may be compelled to do 
at a news conference tuesday bush who often has vented his 
frustration at the slow pace of senate consideration of his 
nominees accused the democraticled congress of blocking 
everything i do 
meanwhile mitchell repeatedly has accused bush of footdragging 
on other key government positions he told the senate recently that 
bush had failed to make nominations for nearly half of the key 
executive branch jobs and that bushs criticism of senate inaction 
was unfounded and unfair 
another controversial judicial nomination involves vaughn 
walker who is no relation to john walker 
vaughn walker is being questioned because of his past membership 
in a private club that long barred blacks from joining and still 
refuses to admit women vaughn walker has been nominated for a 
federal district judge in northern california 
frankly im concerned that he was too slow to grasp the 
significance of his membership sen howard m metzenbaum 
dohio told a senate judiciary committee hearing thursday i 
still wonder whether he resigned because he believed his club 
membership was wrong or because he sought to curry favor with the 
senate 
vaughn walker told the panel the proceedings have made him 
more sensitive now than i was about the need for a federal judge 
to conduct the courtrooms of the united states in a way to insure 
fairness 
walker resigned his 15year membership in san franciscos 
olympic club in a feb 15 letter

after a week of sifting through barrels of lye 
in a warehouse federal drug agents announced friday they had 
turned up 10648 pounds of cocaine one of the largest seizures in 
us history 
the cocaine valued at nearly 852 million or 80000 a pound 
was wrapped in plastic and topped with 6 inches of powder that 
turned out to be a 98 percent concentration of sodium hydroxide an 
extremely caustic lye 
to extricate the cocaine scores of law enforcers wore moon 
suits oxygen masks 40pound air tanks and protective suits 
the sleeves sealed with tape to two pairs of gloves 
the gloves had to be changed twice an hour because the lye ate 
through them that quickly 
sodium hydroxide at that concentration can eat through concrete 
it is nearly 25 times more concentrated than household drain 
cleaner 
the cocaine was discovered nov 3 during a raid on the 
threestory warehouse investigators were searching for five 
suspects believed linked to the cali drug cartel of colombia 
drug enforcement agency officials said a ship the new york 
senator brought the cocaine to philadelphia from panama late last 
month it was then trucked to new york 
the investigation begun by us customs soon encompassed city 
and nassau county police the dea and the emergency medical service 
the teams worked around the clock painstakingly opening the 
drums and decontaminating repackaging and removing the cocaine 
except on sunday when new york marathon participants ran past the 
cordonedoff site 
dea spokeswoman mary cooper said it was one of the five largest 
cocaine seizures in the nations history 
customs special agent rick mercier said the drug could be 
tainted with the lye despite its wrapping 
we strongly suspect other smuggling has occurred using this 
method said mercier the potential is there that cocaine on 
the street may have been contaminated from a users standpoint 
how do they know theyre getting cocaine that hasnt been tainted 
the chemical can irritate the skin and respiratory tract and can 
cause blindness the damage is compounded when its smoked or 
injected 
mercier said thursdays rain caused major safety concerns 
for the workers because slight dampness such as from rain or 
sweat can activate the lyes caustic properties still no 
injuries were reported

defense secretary dick cheney said friday the 
united states must react with caution to changes sweeping the 
warsaw pact but the revolutionary developments might portend 
some changes for the nato alliance if peaceful reforms continue 
the opening of the berlin wall its a major event but its 
important for us to think about what comes after that cheney 
said in an interview at the pentagon minutes after the east german 
government announced that its openborder policy would become 
permanent 
cheney said the us government must develop a longterm 
strategy to deal with the developments that have rocked europeans 
on either side of the iron curtain 
what kinds of governments will develop in the east will they 
be democratically elected what kind of security arrangements 
are going to exist between those nations and the soviet union do 
they constitute any kind of threat to the west cheney asked 
if you get noncommunist governments in eastern europe 
theyre likely to be less of a threat than has been true in the 
past in the military sense and that obviously might portend some 
changes on our side cheney said 
the secretary said the united states and the governments of the 
north atlantic treaty organization need to be cautious 
we need to digest these changes clearly we welcome them but 
we have to be little reserved about formulating major policy shifts 
until we have an opportunity to see what happens cheney said 
adding that he finds the developments in poland hungary and east 
germany very positive the trends very much in the right 
direction 
cheney has said repeatedly that he doesnt see the need for any 
immediate changes in the force structure of nato or realignment of 
the alliance because of the reforms instigated in the east 
east german ambassador gerhard herder also urged caution friday 
speaking at the national press club 
i dont want to hide before you that these developments are 
very dangerous they could lead if they get out of control to 
bigger conflicts herder said 
herder noted that east german armed forces are only a short 
distance away from american british and french forces stationed in 
west berlin by any miscalculation they could be involved this 
could lead to a conflict he said 
a former military commander of the nato forces retired gen 
bernard rogers said friday the changes in europe will result in 
pressures to reduce the 340000member us military force in 
europe 
well find that there will have to be withdrawals from western 
europe because we cant afford to keep our troops there rogers 
said on nbctv 
rogers who served from 1979 to 1987 as natos commander said a 
partial us withdrawal would require the revision of nato 
strategy affecting the socalled forward defense that keeps 
us troops on the front lines in europe should war break out 
the retired general asked as well about the possible 
reunification of germany said he believed the events so far lead 
us in that direction but that the soviet union and many nations 
in western europe are very concerned about such a development 
cheney asked about us support for germany in the midst of the 
refugee influx said hed sent orders to gen john galvin natos 
european commander and the top us military man in europe to 
provide whatever assistance he can to the west german 
government 
the defense secretary emphasized that the soviet union has said 
it wants preserve the warsaw pact and i dont see theres any 
need for us to challenge that at this point 
he said that while he president bush and secretary of state 
james a baker iii all welcome the changes we want the changes 
to occur peaceably 
while we want to encourage freedom and democracy its the 
kind of change we hope will occur without violence without a 
resort to force he said 
cheney said that at this point it appears there have been no 
alerts called among the east european military forces and that 
among the east german police border patrol and military the 
spirit the mood is very positive very upbeat

free world and the communist world let them come to berlin 
there are some who say that communism is the wave of the future 
let them come to berlin 
and there are some who say in europe and elsewhere we can work 
with the communists let them come to berlin 
and there are even a few who say that its true that communism 
is an evil system but it permits us to make economic progress let 
them come to berlin 
freedom has many difficulties and democracy is not perfect but 
we have never had to put a wall up to keep our people in to 
prevent them from leaving us 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
while the wall is the most obvious and vivid demonstration of 
the failures of the communist system all the world can see we take 
no satisfaction in it for it is as your mayor has said an 
offense not only against history but an offense against humanity 
separating families dividing husbands and wives and brothers and 
sisters and dividing a people who wish to be joined together 
what is true of this city is true of germany real lasting peace 
in europe can never be assured as long as one german out of four is 
denied the elementary right of free men and that is to make a free 
choice 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
freedom is indivisible and when one man is enslaved who are 
free when all are free then we can look forward to that day when 
this city will be joined as one and this country and this great 
continent of europe in a peaceful and hopeful globe 
when that day finally comes as it will the people of west 
berlin can take sober satisfaction in the fact that they were in 
the front lines for almost two decades 
all free men wherever they may live are citizens of berlin 
and therefore as a free man i take pride in the words ich bin 
ein berliner

seven holocaust survivors thanked sweden on 
friday for providing a safe haven to heal their mental and physical 
wounds after world war ii 
if there is a heaven on this earth it was in sweden for me 
and many others seva scheer of st paul who survived the 
auschwitz and bergenbelsen concentration camps told an 
international conference on the role of scandinavians in rescuing 
jews during world war ii 
the conference drew about 150 scholars survivors and 
representatives of nordic governments to the university of 
minnesota and included several people featured in the book 
witnesses to the holocaust an oral history 
the book being published next month by twayne publishersgk 
hall amp co of boston and edited by rhoda lewin of minneapolis 
contains the accounts of survivors as well as liberators 
another survivor featured friday was reidar dittmann a 
norwegian lutheran who ended up in buchenwald concentration camp 
for his activities in the norwegian resistance movement while an 
oslo university student 
now a college art history professor dittmann 67 said sweden 
was the only scandinavian country capable of providing significant 
relief for jews after world war ii ended sweeden was able to keep 
its economy intact due to its neutral status during the war 
dittmann says he owes his survival to swedish count folke 
bernadotte who persuaded heinrich himmler to allow his country to 
take scandinavian inmates from the camps in march 1945 two months 
before ve day 
i weighed 92 pounds dittmann says in the book if my stay 
in buchenwald had lasted for another two months i wouldnt have 
dittmann said sweden rescued 38000 norwegians and danes from 
concentration camps after world war ii 
fred baron 66 of golden valley who was born in austria and 
his wife judy baron 61 of romania both ended up in the 
bergenbelsen but didnt meet until after the war when they found 
themselves in a swedish hospital 
mrs baron credits the swedish government for restoring her 
health and giving her an education 
but sweden was not as kind to jews before the war recalled her 
husband 
as it is well known the world closed itself and refused to 
take in any of these wouldbe jewish immigrants sweden 
unfortunately like most of the other scandinavian countries and 
other countries in the world was no exception during the course 
of the warthe attitude certainly changed he said 
i know that i owe my physical health my sanity to the efforts 
of the swedish government and the people baron said this 
helped to restore us and we regained a measure of confidence in the 
human race baron said he came to minnesota after the war in 
part because of his warm feelings for people of scandinavian 
descent 
julius ancer of minnetonka survived the war by concealing his 
jewish identity later married his teenage sweetheart nusia who 
was among only a few survivors from his hometown in poland 
eventually they moved as refugees to sweden 
we were amazed how friendly officials and the population were 
i didnt believe people could be so friendly to a bunch of 
strangers who couldnt even communicate ancer said not only 
did the swedish government help us with our every need but also 
through them i got my education 
this was like a rebirth he said 
ms scheer 68 experienced the same emotional healing in 
sweden where the only things she possessed upon her arrival were 
the pajamas she was wearing she recalled the delight she felt when 
she was taken to a store in sweden and given new clothes 
i have no desire to go back to the place where i was born but 
someday i would like to revisit sweden again the place where i was 
reborn 
the seventh person to echo the sentiments of thanks on friday 
was rosa nisenholz 64 from st paul 
some 30000 jews were brought to sweden after the war said inga 
gottfarb author of the fatal oblivion which is about 
holocaust survivors sweden and elsewhere

telephone callers in the chicago suburbs should 
be touching some new numbers saturday as the suburbs leave the 
familiar 312 area code for a new number 708 
in the chicago metropolitan area about 90 percent of our 
customers have awareness of the change said pat montgomery a 
spokeswoman for illinois bell outside the chicago area that 
number is probably less 
were urging the chicagoarea people to make sure their 
outoftown customers relatives and friends know about the 
change said miss montgomery on friday 
the phone company is running out of prefixes the first three 
digits after the area code the shortage is not due to population 
growth but to the increase in new services that require separate 
telephone numbers such as fax machines said bell officials 
the 312 area code will remain for the city and 708 will be 
applied to surrounding towns the new area code will extend roughly 
from city limits north to wisconsin west to hampshire and oswego 
east to indiana and south to peotone and beecher 
about 15 million residential lines 750000 business lines and 
36000 pay phones will carry the new 708 code 
while illinois bell says the change wont cost customers 
anything now or in the future businesses have had to deal with new 
business cards stationery and notifying outofstate associates 
the change was announced two years ago and there appeared to be 
little lastminute panic among businesses officials said 
the department has not received a great deal of alarm or 
concern from businesses about making the transition said 
laurence msall assistant to the director of the illinois 
department of commerce and community affairs 
debra hale spokeswoman for the chicago association of commerce 
and industry said businesses have called the change a minor 
annoyance 
there will be a grace period from nov 11 until feb 10 when 
both the old and new systems will work calls between the city and 
its suburbs will go through without use of the area codes and calls 
from other areas will go through to the suburbs with either the old 
or new code 
but on feb 11 callers must dial 1 plus the area code for 
calls between the 312 and 708 areacode zones 
those using the 312 code for the suburbs will be reminded by a 
recording asking them to call again with the new code 
chicago follows several other metropolitan areas forced to split 
from former areacode comrades for want of new prefixes last year 
colorado florida and the boston area all integrated new area 
codes new jersey is on the docket for 1990

discussions of the possible release of 
the 18 western hostages held in lebanon have become more active a 
magazine said friday 
in a report that cited no sources the weekly ashshiraa said 
the us release of iranian assets this week while irans foreign 
minister was in algiers indicated the matter was getting more 
attention 
it is known that the issue of foreign hostages in lebanon has 
been put on the front burner and developments could come up 
concerning the release of some of the hostages very soon the 
magazine said in a twoparagraph story 
it has made similar predictions regularly since november 1987 
when it broke the story of the armsforhostages deal between the 
united states and iran none of its recent hostage reports have 
been accurate 
eight of the western hostages in lebanon are americans 
including the one held longest terry a anderson chief middle 
east correspondent of the associated press kidnapped march 16 
1985 
iran repeated on friday that the us release this week of 567 
million in frozen iranian assets would not affect the status of the 
american hostages most of whom are held by shiite moslem 
kidnappers loyal to iran 
tehran television quoted eftekhar jahroomi legal adviser to 
president hashemi rafsanjani as saying the us action monday 
merely complied with a decision of the usiranian claims 
commission set up in 1981 after talks in algiers 
the payment was solely in line with the algiers agreements 
jahroomi said irans claims against american banks were 
similarly paid 
algeria was the main mediator in negotiations that led to the 
release in january 1981 of 52 americans held hostage 444 days at 
the us embassy in tehran 
irans official islamic republic news agency had said the 
purpose of foreign minister ali akbar velayatis 3day trip to 
algeria was to discuss relations between the two countries 
president bush said tuesday he hoped return of the assets would 
encourage iran to seek release of the hostages but us officials 
also insisted the transfer was not related to the hostage issue 
rafsanjani leader of the pragmatists who seek to end irans 
isolation told a news conference last month he would help secure 
freedom for the hostages if the united states released all iranian 
assets frozen after the embassy was stormed in 1979 
iran says the assets now are worth 12 billion including the 
value of weapons purchased by the late shah mohammad reza pahlevi 
who was overthrown by the islamic revolution in february 1989

a navy spokesman denied on friday a published 
report that sailors aboard the uss iowa took part in looting 
shipmates possessions while they battled the explosion that killed 
47 sailors 
the washington times reported in its friday edition that it had 
received a letter from an officer aboard the iowa who said looting 
occurred while the damage control efforts were going on 
the officer was not identified in the times report but the 
paper also quoted a former iowa sailor gunners mate david james 
as saying he was informed of such looting by a master at arms on 
the ship 
you are correct that there was looting while the damage 
control efforts were ongoing on 19 april the times quoted 
the officer as writing 
those who did the looting were punished either at captains 
mast or at special court martial he added 
two other sailors also have told the times they heard while on 
board the ship that looting occurred although they had not 
actually witnessed the thefts 
navy spokesman lt cmdr craig quigley called the assertions 
completely false 
this is a rumor that has persisted since the day of the 
explosion quigley said of the april 19 blast in the battleships 
no 2 gun turret 
there is no record whatsoever of any tampering with crew 
lockers there was no one seen in the berthing area there was 
nothing strewn around the crew quaters quigley said 
i am sure there are sailors aboard the iowa who believe this 
occurred but there is no record that such a thing ever happened 
quigley said that while the naval investigative service included 
testimony about such alleged actions in its report on the 
explosion such activity was never found to have taken place 
as well he said there is no record of any court martial having 
been convened and such a procedure would be a matter of public 
record 
in its report issued sept 7 the navy concluded that gunners 
mate clayton hartwig of ohio most likely caused the explosion 
by inserting some type of detonator between bags of gunpowder in 
one of the ships 16inch guns 
following complaints from hartwigs family about the report 
several congressional investigations of the navys report have been 
opened 
on thursday the author of the report rear adm richard 
milligan is scheduled to testify about his findings before the 
senate armed services committee

east german ambassador gerhard herder said 
friday his country would be a predictable partner of the west 
in maintaining peace but warned that any miscalculation in reacting 
to the liberalization of his homeland could lead to conflict 
herder noted that armed forces of three allies are stationed in 
berlin the united states britain and france 
by any miscalculation they could be involved this could lead 
to a conflict he said in a speech at the national press club 
the soviet union also has troops in berlin and the city itself 
lies more than 100 miles inside east germany and the east german 
and soviet forces of the warsaw pact 
i dont want to hide before you that these developments are 
very dangerous they could lead if they get out of control to 
bigger conflicts 
herder said president bushs reaction to the events in berlin 
was encouraging and said he hoped the changes in his country 
would open up a new phase in relations with the united states 
my country has always been in the forefront of efforts to 
maintain stability in central europe and intends to remain a 
predictable partner of the west in that effort 
his governments decision to grant freedom of travel is 
irreversible if there are still people who believe the changes 
are cosmetic they are victims of an outlived era of suspicion and 
mistrust 
he was asked whether he could foresee a unified germany 
in my dreams yes but being a politician i dont see any 
prospect for a united germany herder said because east and west 
germany are integrated into military alliances guaranteeing a 
stable balance of power in europe 
asked whether the december meeting between bush and soviet 
president mikhail gorbachev would decide german reunification 
herder said i dont think its a matter to be decided by mr 
bush and mr gorbachev but rather a matter to be decided by the 
people of the two germanies 
asked whether he could envisage a crackdown similar to that by 
chinese authorities against prodemocracy demonstrators in 
beijings tiananmen square last june herder said i exclude it 
personally and i can tell you the east german government is 
committed to solve all problems by political means 
asked whether the berlin wall would come down he replied we 
should have no illusions and not be led by euphoria

prosecutors are examining the case of 
cardinal jozsef mindszenty one of the cold wars most famous 
victims and he may be cleared of treason charges the official 
news agency mti said friday 
officials ordered earlier this year that the prosecutor 
generals office review the case against the late roman catholic 
primate who was convicted at a show trial in 1949 
the reform movement sweeping hungary already has brought the 
posthumous rehabilitation of imre nagy who led the antistalinist 
uprising that was crushed by soviet tanks in 1956 
mindszenty was sentenced to life in prison for high treason 
after confessing presumably under duress or drugs to most of the 
charges against him 
it was established during the reexamination that the relevant 
authorities committed law violations which also affected the 
sentence passed mti said 
presumably the persons interrogated during the criminal 
procedure made their confessions under the impact of violence or 
compulsion it reported without elaboration 
a major proportion of the material proof on which the 
verdict was based was missing from files according to the report 
mti did not say how long the investigation might take 
mindszenty had been appointed head of the hungarian church with 
the communist governments assent but was arrested at the end of 
1948 as tension grew between the church and state 
he was freed during the 1956 uprising and took refuge in the 
us embassy mindszenty stayed there until 1971 when he left 
under an agreement worked out with the vatican 
he died in 1975 at age 83 while living in selfimposed exile in 
vienna

rep tom lantos dcalif said friday that 
bulgarias new leader petar mladenov was no democrat although 
he might surprise the world just as egon krenz has in east germany 
lantos who has known members of the bulgarian leadership for 
many years said he met with communist party leader todor zhivkov 
at his black sea summer palace in august 
zhivkov the soviet blocs longestserving party leader 
resigned friday in a surprise move but lantos said he wasnt 
surprised 
i expected this the hungarianborn lawmaker said in an 
interview from his california office 
the bulgarian people have always looked to the hungarians as 
their role model once democracy started breaking out in hungary 
bulgaria could not be far behind 
hungary will be the first east european nation to hold free 
elections probably next spring a fledgling prodemocracy movement 
has sprung up in bulgaria in recent months 
lantos said he found zhivkov in good shape and good spirits 
he never seems to age 
he spoke of reform and i urged him to match his words with 
actions lantos said adding that zhivkov urged him to help bring 
about us investments and joint ventures in bulgaria 
this is largely a generational change lantos said of the 
power shuffle in bulgaria mladenov was zhivkovs boy in the 
foreign ministry hes no democrat although he sounds more 
moderate 
but lantos noted that when east germanys ailing ruler erich 
honecker stepped down last month everyone said krenz his 
successor was just a younger version of the hardline leader 
however krenz this week opened east german borders allowing 
residents to travel freely 
you might see a parallel development in bulgaria too

georgetown university students refused to 
publish an edition of their newspaper friday because officials of 
the roman catholic institution had forbidden them to run an 
advertisement on an abortion rights rally 
the universitys stand on the advertisement prompted swift 
protests from prochoice organizations and national education 
groups 
the ad was not promoting any specific service said karl 
hente a senior who serves as the papers managing editor the ad 
was for a prochoice rally and was basically expressing a political 
viewpoint the newspapers foundation is freedom of expression 
the twiceweekly georgetown hoya had first asked university 
officials to review the ad but when the university was slow to 
respond the papers student board of directors voted on wednesday 
to include the ad in fridays edition 
the schools dean of students jack degioia then told newspaper 
officials that they could not publish the issue with the ad and 
the papers board responded by voting unanimously not to put out a 
paper at all 
the newspaper did print up several thousand flyers explaining 
the decision not to publish and distributed them around campus 
the reaction has been overwhelmingly positive hente said 
i got to some academic buildings and i found that some 
professors had already posted them on their office doors while 
others were talking about it in their classes 
the american association of university professors which was 
meeting on georgetowns campus issued a statement supporting the 
students decision not to publish the resolution was also endorsed 
by the united states national student association the association 
of american colleges and several other education groups 
we are a catholic jesuit institution and we dont allow 
advertisements of condoms abortions or things like that said 
georgetown spokesman gary krull basically it was an interpretive 
question between the dean of students the papers publisher and 
the student editorial board 
the rally which will be held sunday at the lincoln memorial is 
designed to build support for family planning and a womans right 
to an abortion 
national organization for women president molly yard whose 
organization is sponsoring the event chastised georgetown 
im kind of horrified that any university would deny free 
speech yard said that they are afraid to allow open diologue 
isnt a very good teaching example to a group that is there to 
get an education 
hente said that the newspaper would accept and try to publish 
any other advertisements submitted in the future for rallies or 
forums sponsored by groups like now 
were not out for publicity hente said we just want to 
publish but this is something we take very seriously

a maryland company said friday it will begin 
field trials of a plant vaccine which could inoculate corn plants 
against an insect that costs us farmers 500 million a year 
in greenhouse tests corn borer damage was reduced by 80 percent 
in plants inoculated with the naturally occuring microorganism 
according to a statement released by crop genetics international of 
hanover md 
this is the first time that a plant has been able to grow its 
own geneticallyengineered pesticide in its vascular system the 
company said 
the borer is a pest on 20 million acres of the us corn crop 
the company said us farmers annually lose 200 million bushels of 
corn worth 500 million to the borer 
if it proves to be effective if it can be easily used and it 
is not too costly it will do minnesota farmers a lot of good 
said ken ostlie a university of minnesota entomologist 
minnesota lost an average of 107 million worth of corn to the 
borer from 1981 to 1983 years in which borer infestation was 
particularly bad ostlie said 
the microorganism whose scientific name is bacillus 
thuringiensis is harmless to humans and animals making it 
preferable to chemical pesticides according to the company which 
specializes in developing biological pesticides 
our incide vaccine is environmentally more attractive than 
synthetic chemical pesticides said company chairman john b 
henry 
a prototype of the vaccine was field tested in several states a 
newer more potent version was effective in greenhouse tests and is 
scheduled for field trials in maryland next summer the company 
said 
the bacteria already is being used as a pesticide by being 
applied on corn in granular form ostlie said 
researchers are concerned about whether the borers would become 
resistant to the toxin if it goes into widespread use

for 45 years the fate of us army sgt lloyd 
willard wibben was a mystery to both his family and the residents 
of treguier a coastal village in northwestern france 
the family knew wibben had died somewhere in france during world 
war ii 
the villagers knew an american soldier fell while liberating 
their town but they never knew his name 
a historians persistence finally led to the name jotted in the 
yellowed pages of a diary kept by the commander of wibbens 
regiment 
this week mervin wibben of st charles ill arrived in 
treguier population 3400 at the invitation of city elders to 
join them in honoring his older brother 
on saturday armistice day in france wibben will lay a wreath 
at a new monument the villagers are dedicating to the man who was 
once their unknown soldier 
lloyd wibben was 24 years old on aug 14 1944 when his 15th 
cavalry reconnaissance squadron advanced just to the edge of 
treguier a village 250 miles west of paris 
they found the road blocked by debris so wibben and other 
soldiers left their vehicles to clear the road wibben was killed 
in a barrage of german fire 
the villagers placed a simple granite marker where he died 
dedicated to the unknown american soldier who died during the 
liberation 14 august 1944 he was buried in plot k row 7 at the 
american military cemetery at st james in normandy along with 
about 4400 other us soldiers who died in the fighting 
the americans took the village and eventually stopped the nazis 
counterattack on avranches 
all we really knew was that that we got telegram from the army 
that lloyd was killed in france wibben said wednesday by 
telephone from treguier 
we didnt know too much more of it until treguier contacted us 
to help in this ceremony he said he really is some kind of 
hero to the people here 
the people of treguier did not know the soldiers name until 
local historian yvon herve launched a research project about two 
years ago 
his search eventually led him to retired col robert dwan who 
commanded the 15th cavalry regiment and kept a diary listing all 
the men under his command who had died 
dwan showed herve the entry for aug 14 1944 and further 
investigation confirmed that wibben was treguiers unknown soldier 
very few people in the war kept a diary like that said 
mervin wibben a semiretired meat processor who served with the 
us army in the pacific most of them just wanted to forget 
about everything 
herve considered the puzzle fully solved in midseptember and 
treguier officials started planning a ceremony to place a bronze 
plaque with wibbens name over the old granite marker 
because we have learned his identity we wanted to invite his 
brother said herve for us this ceremony is a symbol of our 
freedom 
mervin wibben and his wife jan flew to paris courtesy of air 
france on wednesday before traveling on to treguier they visited 
wibbens grave and will tour the area around the world war ii 
battlefields before leaving for home sunday 
it really broke me up bad when lloyd died mervin wibben 
said he was five years older than me but we were really close 
he left me his car when he volunteered for the service 
the family natives of yankton sd included seven brothers 
and four sisters mervin is the first to visit lloyds grave 
when they called it brought back a lot of memories and a 
few tears he said lloyd was a prince he wanted to go fight 
for his country he loved horses so much he signed up for the 
cavalry but when he got to europe it was all mechanized 
saturdays ceremony comes nine days before lloyd wibben would 
have celebrated his 70th birthday

east germanys upheaval will rattle all europe 
impelling the two germanys toward political and economic 
association and throwing into question the nato and warsaw pact 
alliances american experts said friday 
it is probably the most important strategic change since the 
war said gregory treverton senior fellow for europe at the 
council on foreign relations 
the center of europe the germanys still are the most 
strategic landscape in the world this change there is the most 
important thing to happen in europe certainly for the last 30 
years treverton said in an interview 
while reforms in poland and hungary initiated the process 
treverton said east germany was the place where weve always 
presumed change would come last now we find it coming very soon 
and very quickly 
the lifting of travel restrictions and promised political reform 
there means the successful selfliberation of the german 
democratic republic which in itself is a momentous event prof 
fritz stern of columbia university said also in a telephone 
interview 
moreover in its aftershocks it is likely to change the 
politics of europe and the political climate of europe said 
stern a historian specializing in europe its an astounding 
historical development 
east germany said friday it was permanently lifting travel 
restrictions on its citizens and tens of thousands of east germans 
streamed into west berlin through the newly opened berlin wall 
many however are expected to return 
the events were sparked by proreform demonstrations across east 
germany and the flight to freedom of thousands of east germans 
that forced the oct 18 ouster of hardline leader erich honecker 
his successor egon krenz swept aside the old guard in the ruling 
politburo and has promised political reform including free 
elections 
allied conquerors sliced germany into the democratic west and 
communist east after world war ii and forces of the warsaw pact 
on the east and the north atlantic treaty organization on the 
west have faced each other across the two germanys every since 
now treverton said the question for the short term is whether 
east germany will produce economic and political reforms sufficient 
to build for itself some legitimacy the conundrum is that if 
it fails it loses all legitimacy he said but if it succeeds 
then its difficult to see what basis there is for a separate 
state 
then the question is whether some sort of reassociation in 
stages can happen and how than would be regarded by the rest of 
europe treverton said its no so much reunification as what 
form association of the states takes and over what time period 
stern held a largely similar view it sounds to me as though 
the east german government is trying desperately to find some 
stability and that it might be able to satisfy its citizens with 
the promises made and the deeds committed and then enter into 
negotiations with the federal republic west germany for vast 
economic aid 
and then you would have two german states in the short run 
in very close association thats not yet reunification and i 
could imagine that it wouldnt become reunification for many 
years 
the response of other european states is critical treverton 
noted because of their fear that a reunited germany would 
contribute to the kind of political instability that preceded the 
world war 
most of the rest of western europe is exhilarated and nervous 
in about equal proportions he said nobody knows whether the 
nature of the european state system has changed enough that a 
germany that was always destabilizing before may not be so this 
time around 
with that concern treverton said nato and probably the 
warsaw pact ought to stay in place a long time as a kind of 
residual insurance policy 
john vessey jr former chairman of the us joint chiefs of 
staff also said there was reason for caution amid the jubilation 
east germany is not appearing to be in control of its own 
destiny vessey said from his home in garrison minn i would 
hope there isnt a crackdown 
stern however wondered if the east bloc alliance had not 
already largely crumbled what is left of the warsaw pact he 
asked would the soviets really be able to count on the poles and 
the hungarians even if they could count on the east germans or 
maintain their troops there 
one possible outcome he suggested was a breathing period 
in which the americans soviets british and french along with the 
two germanys might reach agreements reducing their troops there 
on the economic front treverton suggested that the european 
economic community promptly open negotiations with east germany and 
the other changing eastern european states in order to cement its 
position as the economic framework for the new europe 
stern for his part said the impact of the upheavals on 
europes economy particularly on western europes economic merger 
in 1992 remain to be seen 
nobody could have predicted what has occurred so far he 
said so its foolhardy to make any predictions

former socialist premier andreas 
papandreou received a presidential mandate friday to try to form a 
government but all three major parties were offering conflicting 
solutions to end the political deadlock 
conservative leader constantine mitsotakis earlier friday 
returned his mandate to president christos sartzetakis and proposed 
a shortterm administration to tackle pressing economic problems 
underscoring the crisis the central bank friday ordered 
commercial banks to limit credit extended to the private sector 
because of a cash shortfall 
there is a need for a government with international prestige 
made up of personalities which will be supported by all 
parties mitsotakis told a news conference 
he said the government members should not be politicians and 
elections should be held early next year 
the deadlock arose after mitsotakis new democracy party won the 
most votes in last sundays elections but missed a majority in the 
300seat parliament 
new democracy won 148 seats in the elections papandreous 
panhellenic socialist movement or pasok took 128 and the 
communistled coalition of the left and progress won 21 three 
seats went to independents 
papandreou who governed from 1981 until june proposed a 
longterm alliance between pasok the leftist coalition and two 
independents 
he said now was not the time to consider mitsotakis proposal 
for a government supported by all parties but did not rule out 
such an eventuality 
the leftist coalition supports the idea of a broadbased 
government of personalities but its conditions for backing it 
include a freeze on negotiations on the future of us military 
bases in greece 
if papandreou fails to form a government by monday he will 
return the mandate to the president and it will be given to 
coalition leader harilaos florakis 
the last government administered by a conservativecommunist 
alliance dedicated itself only to investigating and indicting 
papandreou and five of his former ministers on corruption charges 
papandreou who has denied all charges is to be tried by a 
special high court early next year

an art gallery director fighting to keep a 
10000 federal grant in a test of a new antiobscenity law said 
friday she fears a return to the blacklists of the 1950s 
and i do not think blacklists are a good thing to have in this 
country said susan wyatt executive director of artists space in 
downtown manhattan 
last june artists space sponsored an exhibition of eastern 
european art from that show we learned a great deal about the 
aesthetic poverty of official vs unofficial art wyatt said at a 
news conference i sincerely hope that this country is not moving 
in that direction 
in a nov 3 letter national endowment for the arts chairman 
john e frohnmayer revoked the grant for the gallerys upcoming 
aids art exhibition he said later the exhibition catalog indicated 
the show was political rather than artistic in nature 
artist spaces board on wednesday unanimously rejected the 
request to relinquish its claim to the grant the boards decision 
is our way of defending the american publics right to form their 
own opinions on artistic expression wyatt said 
the endowment is withholding the 10000 pending a legal opinion 
from the justice department 
wyatt said she had not yet obtained a lawyer and would not 
speculate on what actions might be taken 
were kind of in a crisis situation she said 
the show will open nov 16 exactly as we had planned she 
said 
it features works by 23 painters sculptors and photographers 
that portray the effects of aids on the artistic community an 
apparent sticking point was a catalog essay by david wojnarowicz a 
photographer who has aids which assails cardinal john j oconnor 
rep william e dannemeyer rcalif and sen jesse helms rnc 
it would be extremely naive to publish a catalog with strong 
language and references to public figures and not expect some kind 
of comment or controversy said wyatt 
still she said we didnt decide to do a catalog that was 
politically charged we are publishing a catalog with artistic 
texts and writing 
wyatt said that although the show includes some images of male 
and female nudity this is not a show about politics this is not 
a show about sexuality this is a show about aids

american dream of home ownership for all americans and provide 
shelter for the poor and homeless with a threeyear 42 billion 
spending package 
the true measure of success isnt how many families we add to 
housing assistance rolls its how many families move up and out 
and into the ranks of homeowners bush said without specifying 
where he would find the money 
the secretary of housing and urban development jack kemp told 
reporters he hoped the money would come from a cut in the capital 
gains tax a proposal that has encountered vigorous opposition on 
capitol hill 
kemp said the spending would be new money and that it was not 
his understanding it would come from other housing programs 
bush speaking to the national association of realtors outlined 
42 billion in federal spending for three years starting in fiscal 
1991 which begins oct 1 1990 
in addition to the 42 billion in actual spending kemp said 
the package will cost the government several billion dollars in 
revenue lost due to tax incentives including lowincome housing 
tax credits and penaltyfree ira withdrawals for home down payments 
the program unlike congressional housing proposals does not 
provide any money for new construction of lowincome housing 
the financing levels in the bush proposal are well below 
legislation making its way through both the house and senate but 
well above anything proposed in the reagan administration 
bush proposed 215 billion in grants to help lowincome 
families buy units in public housing buildings or vacant or 
foreclosed properties under the program home ownership and 
opportunity for people everywhere or hope 
however kemp said the grant money would not go directly to home 
buyers most would go to local groups that rehabilitate or buy such 
properties and make the housing available at belowmarket prices 
about onethird of the grant money money would be used by such 
groups to help poor people with mortgages said kemps assistant 
mary brunette 
the real centerpiece of our hope initiative bush said is 
to recapture the american dream for home ownership for those who 
have been left behind through resident management and resident 
ownership 
in washington rep charles schumer dny a member of the 
house committee on banking housing and urban affairs said in a 
statement i welcome the spotlight that president bush has shone 
on housing but he argued the presidents plan merely arranges 
the deck chairs on the titanic the 42 billion could be 
better spent building new units 
bushs plan 
provides 728 million for the homeless to be equally matched 
by states local government or private groups for housing and 
support services such as social and mental health programs that 
would be above the more than 200 million already envisioned in hud 
spending under the mckinney act to serve the homeless through a 
variety of federal programs 
allows firsttime homebuyers to use their individual retirement 
accounts for down payments without paying a penalty for withdrawal 
however they would have to pay taxes on the money kemp said 
asks congress to create 50 innercity enterprise zones over 
four years where investors would be given tax incentives for 
undertaking development 
includes 1075 billion for tenants to convert and rehabilitate 
federally subsidized housing into residentowned cooperatives 
tenant groups would have the first right to buy buildings whose 
owners leave the lowincome housing programs about 334000 units 
would be affected by that provision in the next 15 years 
provides 210 million for insurance and rental rehabilitation 
grants in 50 housing opportunity zones these areas would be 
selected on the basis of which localities best removed zoning and 
other bureaucratic barriers to providing affordable housing 
provides 44 million for a demonstration project to set up 
servicesupported housing for the frail elderly that would 
given them both housing vouchers and assistance to pay for services 
they need to live independently 
requires public housing authorities and local governments to 
help welfare and other lowincome families with job training child 
care transportation and other assistance 
this is the first time a republican president has acknowledged 
that the war on poverty is not only an essential inner city 
strategy that there are pockets of poor left out of the 
recovery kemp said 
in a new bid to revive his flagging proposal to cut the capital 
gains tax bush said he would tie that proposal to renewal of a 
lowincome tax credit due to expire at the end of the year 
proponents of a reduction in taxes on capital gains contend 
businesses would invest the extra money in projects that ultimately 
would increase government revenues opponents however say the 
government would not recoup the lost revenue 
the lowincome tax credit was enacted in the 1986 tax reform act 
to encourage the development of lowincome rental housing in 
exhange for highly favorable tax treatment bush proposed renewing 
the credit as part of a package of reforms that includes a cut in 
the capital gains tax 
however kemp indicated bush would not hold the lowincome tax 
credit renewal hostage to passage of the capital gains reduction 
the capital gains issue was among the most contentious between 
the white house and congress this year the administration agreed 
last week not to continue blocking other legislation by trying to 
attach a capital gains provision to it at least for the rest of 
this year 
bush said kemp would name a commission to find ways to remove 
bureaucratic barriers to construction and rehabilitation of 
affordable housing in inner cities 
no city state or town should receive a single penny of hope 
funding until they have identified barriers to affordable housing 
in their own back yard and started taking steps to remove them 
bush said

without bias will be permitted when their credibility is vouched 
and guaranteed by a responsible person or organization he said 
a cable news network television crew visited burma this month 
ending a ban on foreign reporters that coincided with the military 
juntas crackdown on the opposition 
burma has been a oneparty state since ne win toppled the 
elected government in a military coup in 1962 and instituted a 
rigid socialist system that impoverished what had been considered 
one of asias most prosperous states

chief gen saw maung seized power two months later and troops 
killed thousands of people in a crackdown on dissent

philippines president corazon aquino ended her 
visit here friday with pledges of us economic support but no 
outward sign that she will back continued american use of military 
bases in her country 
before departing mrs aquino breakfasted with vice president 
dan quayle and usbacked nicaraguan opposition candidate violeta 
chamorro 
the two women both the wives of slain national leaders 
discussed their common experiences in entering politics said 
quayle aide carnes lord asked if mrs chamorro hoped to cash in on 
some of mrs aquinos popularity lord said that was the idea 
obviously 
mrs aquino accompanied by members of her cabinet and aides 
later left for dallas where she planned to resume what she has 
described as the main purpose of her mission to the united states 
encouraging trade and investment needed for the philippines 
economic recovery 
before departing she agreed during a 30minute talk with 
defense secretary richard cheney to start exploratory talks in 
manila in middecember on the future of the philippine bases 
philippines foreign secretary raul manglapus said 
manglapus who attended the aquinocheney meeting at a downtown 
hotel told reporters it all depends on the results of the 
exploratory talks whether the december meetings lead to 
negotiations on a new bases agreement after the existing pact 
expires in 1991 
if both sides see after the talks that negotiations are 
worthwhile towards a new treaty then those negotiations will begin 
soon afterward manglapus said during a national press club 
appearance 
manglapus who will lead the manila talks said there must first 
be exploratory meetings to determine if negotiations are 
worthwhile towards a new treaty opening the possibility that 
the basing arrangement might not be renewed 
president bush and administration officials however have 
voiced optimism that the process will lead to a new agreement 
manglapus said the exploratory talks should deal with use of the 
bases jurisdiction over criminal cases and compensation 
he mentioned no payment amount in talks a year ago manglapus 
had demanded 12 billion worth of aid during each of the last two 
years of the current agreement negotiators finally settled on 480 
million annually 
various opinion polls show that the philippine public supports 
keeping the us military presence aquinos reluctance to take a 
stand is regarded by some bush administration officials and members 
of congress as both a negotiating tactic and recognition of strong 
opposition to the bases in the philippine senate 
in his welcoming remarks thursday bush said you deserve our 
help and you will get it i pledge our continuing assistance to 
your government and that means security assistance as well as aid 
to economic development and it means cooperating in your important 
debtreduction programs

industrialist armand hammer underwent surgery 
friday to have a pacemaker implanted in his heart and was reported 
in good condition afterward at ucla medical center 
a statement from his company occidental petroleum corp did 
not elaborate but hammer 91 has a history of painful heart 
flutters and had been reported to be making monthly visits to his 
cardiologist dr jan tillisch 
the surgery performed friday afternoon by pacemaker specialist 
dr peter guzy was voluntary occidental spokesman frank ashley 
said late friday afternoon 
he is alert and talking ashley said 
doctors expect him to be released from the hospital in a few 
days and return to normal activity ashley and ucla spokesman mike 
byrne said 
a pacemaker regulates electrical activity in the heart so that 
it beats normally in a person who suffers abnormal heart rhythms 
hammer the chairman of occidental is nearly as wellknown for 
his art collecting and philanthropy as for his business acumen he 
considers himself a private ambassador for world peace and has met 
every soviet leader since vladimir lenin 
after word of hammers hospitalization leaked trading in 
occidental stock was suspended on the new york stock exchange the 
price of occidental shares has surged in the past when hammer has 
been reported to be in ill health 
analysts say the reason is that without the longtime chairmans 
presence the company would become a likely takeover target

watergateera crime making illegal contributions to president 
nixons reelection campaign in 1972 
hammer had pleaded guilty to the charges in 1976 was placed on 
probation for one year and fined 3000 he had campaigned for a

east germanys communist party on friday promised 
free elections freedom of association and assembly closer 
supervision of its security forces and an end to official 
privileges 
in other moves to boost its sagging authority the partys 
central committee also sacked four officials from the ruling 
politburo and launched a broad investigation of gross mistakes 
made under ousted party boss erich honecker 
the committee gave no precise timetable or details of the 
promised political reforms but it suggested they should be adopted 
without delay 
the party moves followed the communist governments stunning 
decision to throw open the east germanys borders to the west for 
the first time since the berlin wall was built in 1961 
they came at the end of a threeday committee meeting and 
closely followed similar promises made wednesday by new party 
leader egon krenz the committee also confirmed krenz 52 as party 
general secretary 
like the dramatic move to open the borders it kept shut for 28 
years the leaderships promises seemed an attempt to address the 
demands for more democracy made by hundreds of thousands of 
demonstrators in recent weeks 
they are also designed to calm grassroots party members who 
vented their anger at party leaders at two rallies this week and 
to give the communists a program they can try to sell to restore 
the partys standing 
the policymaking committee approved a document that admitted 
grave mistakes made by honecker ousted oct 18 and the old 
politburo that resigned en masse wednesday led to a deep crisis 
radical reforms are indispensable the document added 
to this end it promised 
free general democratic and secret elections adding 
that the communists support a democratic coalition government 
more autonomy for local government and the greater separation 
of party and government bodies 
new laws on freedom of assembly association the press and 
moves to restore the supremacy of law and independence of the 
judiciary 
greater openness in the media and a new law on the press 
a parliamentary committee controlling the work of the secret 
police and other security organs 
investigation of the mistakes of the old party leaders and an 
end to undeserved privileges for all party officials 
more say for the workers more role for market forces and more 
orientation toward consumer goods in the economy 
we have a great task before us a revolution on german soil 
which will bring us a socialism that is economically effective 
politically democratic and morally clean krenz told a party 
rally in east berlin friday night 
he gave no further details of the plans for free elections the 
key demand of east germans rallying for democracy in recent weeks 
the next parliamentary elections are not due until 1991 and 
krenz told visiting west german social democrat johannes rau on 
thursday that he intended to stick to that timetable 
however some party members have demanded that elections be held 
next year at the latest 
the official news agency adn said four politburo members were 
expelled friday and that two former honecker associates were 
removed from the central committee 
fired friday were full member hansjoachim boehme and three 
candidate or nonvoting members johannes chemnitzer werner 
walde and inge lange 
boehme 59 had lost the support of his local party 
organization adn said 
earlier this week the 21member politburo was reduced to 11 
members the latest changes left the politburo with 10 full and 
three nonvoting members 
the meeting also set a party conference for dec 1517 to 
discuss personnel changes in the 163member central committee 
two longtime honecker associates guenter mittag and joachim 
herrmann were kicked out of the central committee 
the central committee accused them of greatly damaging the 
reputation of the party and ordered a special commission to 
investigate their mistakes the investigation would include other 
party members adn said 
mittag had been honeckers economy czar and herrmann had been 
propaganda chief 
the 10member politburo now is made up of krenz werner 
eberlein wolfgang herger werner jarowinsky heinz kessler 
siegfried lorenz hans modrow wolfgang rauchfuss guenter 
schabowski and gerhard schuerer 
its three nonvoting members are margarete muller guenter

for decades politicians in bonn 
dreamed of embracing east germans in the free west now chancellor 
helmut kohl has rushed back from warsaw to keep the flood of 
humanity from turning the dream into a nightmare 
in one of the most dramatic shifts in postwar europe the 
communist east german government has thrown open the berlin wall 
and also let people cross through the heavily fortified borders 
into west germany on friday in response to the flow of refugees 
and overwhelming criticism from the public the communist partys 
policymaking central committee also promised free elections and 
greater separation of party and state 
the joy of those who came through by foot and car and even on 
skateboards only temporarily deflected attention from a suddenly 
volatile central europe 
on the human level there is the question of what do with the 
200000 east germans who already have poured into west germany to 
say nothing of the 1 million more that some have predicted may 
swamp one of europes most densely populated countries 
mayor walter momper of west berlin told a session of the upper 
house of parliament the east german newcomers will keep causing 
large and weighty problems for west germans 
but if we never forget the suffering caused by the berlin 
wall and if we keep recalling the happy faces and joy of 
yesterday we can master this challenge together momper said 
speaking the day after the borders were thrown open 
after breaking off a politically sensitive trip to poland kohl 
planned an emergency meeting of the cabinet saturday to map 
strategy at issue is how to proceed both at home and in regard to 
the breakneck pace of changes in east germany 
the chancellor told reporters the session will consider 
necessary special measures without elaborating 
government sources speaking to the associated press on 
condition of anonymity said kohl also will try to speak with new 
east german communist party leader egon krenz by telephone within 
the next few few days 
from a military standpoint the two nations remain at the 
forefront of still officially hostile military alliances west 
germany is the base for 250000 us troops while nearly 400000 
soviet troops are based in east germany 
the military element is vital to the increasingly frequent 
predictions the latest shifts and uncertainty in east germany will 
lead to a german reunification 
neither washington nor moscow is likely to give up completely 
its frontline ally any time soon and german neutrality is a risk 
that many in west germany are unlikely to take 
still says conservative west german lawmaker eduard lintner 
reunification is coming closer but i cant say whether it will 
take 10 15 or 20 years we have the impression that things are 
much more concrete than we could have imagined five years ago 
any move toward reunification would cause unease and perhaps 
resistance in the soviet union france britain and some other 
european countries 
a reunified germany also would mean an enormous financial 
sacrifice for west germany as tax money from bonn flowed eastward 
to modernize increasingly outmoded factories and to clean up some 
of europes worst pollution 
perhaps as an interim measure kohl increasingly has been 
demanding democratic reforms in east germany in direct exchange for 
bonns financial aid to keep east germans from leaving in droves 
kohl said while still in warsaw that west germany could be 
ready to offer significant economic aid if the will to reform 
manifested itself in east germany 
at times it seems that as kohl talks less and less about actual 
reunification the more the topic goes from a nostalgic dream into 
the realm of serious discussion 
kohl and his top aides also have increasingly been painting a 
bleak picture for the east germans who might want to come over it 
is another sign of growing stress for the government the strapped 
social services and problems such as lack of housing for the 
newcomers 
every refugee must figure that he will have to live in 
inadequate housing for a fairly long time and will probably be 
living much worse than if he had stayed home interior minister 
wolfgang schaeuble told parliament thursday 
schaeuble repeated the same warning the following day although 
claiming the east germans still are welcome

a brush fire stopped short of an affluent 
development above pacific palisades on friday because homeowners 
had cleared away brush and waterdropping helicopters acted 
quickly officials said 
the morning blaze charred nearly 90 acres of chapparal in santa 
ynez canyon in hot dry weather 
within two hours four other brush fires also were reported in 
los angeles county including a 200acre blaze that briefly 
threatened ranches outside of lancaster 50 miles north of downtown 
los angeles all of the fires were contained within hours and no 
injuries or property damage were reported authorities said 
the other wildfires burned 30 acres in the santa susana 
mountains of the san fernando valley 15 acres near diamond bar 
along the san bernardino county line and one acre in rowland 
heights about 20 miles east of downtown officials said 
the palisades fire quickly raged into highlands from sunset 
boulevard toward the development known as the palisades highlands 
said fire department spokesman greg acevedo 
five helicopters operated by city and county fire crews helped 
slow the fire moving like mud wasps between flames leaping 40 feet 
high and the nearby santa ynez reservoir twentynine engine 
companies assisted from the ground 
the fire department has been on our tails to keep the brush 
cleared and thats whats saved us said hyman h haves board 
chairman for 15 homeowners associations in palisades highlands 
the dense chaparral canyons of topanga state park surround the 
palisades highlands community the spanishstyle development 
nestled in the santa monica mountains consists of 1200 
condominiums and homes valued from 400000 to 4 millionlanc 50 
mileas north downtown 
ash fell like a light snowfall over the community but haves 
said there were no wooden shingle roofs in the area another factor 
that helped stymie the fire 
he added that the fast response by helicopters was pivotal 
they just doused it he said 
the palisades highlands are just inland from the pacific 
palisades in the foothills of the santa monica mountains east of 
malibu

nicaraguas government and the usbacked 
contras made progress in their talks on a ceasefire amnesty and 
disbanding of the rebels officials said friday the parties will 
meet again next week 
the talks recessed in the midst of discussing the toughest 
issue whether the contras would commit to a timetable for 
disbanding as part of a package deal including a ceasefire and 
amnesty 
we are negotiating now our return to nicaragua in accord with 
the tela agreement and we are ready to go back once there is a 
meeting of minds between the sandinistas and our side said 
enrique bermudez the contra military commander and chief 
negotiator 
the agreeement signed in tela honduras by the five central 
american presidents last aug 7 calls for disbanding of the 
contras by dec 5 
we are negotiating in that sense it is positive it is 
negative in the sense that we could not achieve a ceasefire there 
is a war in nicaragua said bermudez 
the chief nicaraguan negotiator deputy foreign minister victor 
hugo tinoco said i think we were able to find some coincidence 
of views and next week in washington we are going to continue 
those discussions and we hope we will able to get a sound 
agreement that will incorporate the demobilization and the 
ceasefire 
un spokesman juan carlos brandt said the talks will resume 
monday at the washington headquarters of the organization of 
american states 
the talks are being jointly mediated by the oas and the united 
nations 
diplomats said privately that the contra delegation wanted to 
confer over the weekend with a new rebel leadership commission that 
was announced this week 
brandt confirmed the contras were still discussing the details 
of demobilizing 
earlier he said headway was being made on the sandinista 
insistence on an agreement for the contras to disband and on rebel 
demands for an amnesty and truce 
bermudez has not rejected the dec 5 deadline or the concept of 
demobilization in the tela accords which the contras did not sign 
said a source close to the talks speaking on condition of 
anonymity 
the leftist sandinistas and contras are close to agreement on a 
ceasefire but the government wants the truce to be part of a pact 
to disband the contras said the source 
despite tough talk both sides appeared committed to reaching 
agreement on ending an 8yearold war that has cost an estimated 
12000 lives 
one new element of uncertainty is whether all contra field 
commanders will abide by any agreement reached at the united 
nations 
this week a new rebel civilianmilitary commission was 
announced 
the leader of the new commission israel galeano said in a 
letter to vice president dan quayle released friday it would be 
foolish to voluntarily hand over our weapons before free elections 
are held feb 25 
the new commission still authorizes bermudez to negotiate on its 
behalf the nicaraguan negotiators recognize the new commission 
when the first direct talks in more than a year began thursday 
the usbacked rebels said they would not disband until the 
sandinistas granted amnesty and renewed the ceasefire president 
daniel ortega canceled last week 
government negotiators said nicaragua would not reinstate the 
truce nor grant amnesty until the contras agreed to demobilize 
the agreement ortega and the presidents of costa rica 
guatemala honduras and el salvador signed at tela requires that 
the contras be disbanded by dec 5 and nicaragua hold free 
elections by feb 25 
asked if an agreement was possible bermudez replied anything 
is possible with political will 
in managua government and rebels accused each other friday of 
launching recent attacks

federal and state health officials on 
friday worked to discover what caused an outbreak of a rare and 
sometimes fatal blood disorder 
thirtyone cases had been reported by friday in six widely 
scattered states including 21 in new mexico as health authorities 
sought to determine if the outbreak was linked to the use of 
ltryptophan an amino acid dietary supplement 
the disease eosinophilia is characterized by high counts of 
eosinophils a type of white blood cell symptoms may include sharp 
muscular pain fatigue fever and rashes 
dr millicent eidson environmental epidemiologist with the 
state health and environment department said 21 cases of 
eosinophilia have been confirmed in new mexico and an additional 
case involving a nearby arizona resident was reported 
eidson said 16 of the 17 women patients and one of the five men 
had taken ltryptophan which is often sold in health food stores 
to promote relaxation and to ease premenstrual syndrome and 
sleeping disorders 
medical officials also reported four cases in oregon three in 
texas and one each from missouri and mississippi by friday 
at least five of those nine patients also used ltryptophan 
said nancy hunter spokeswoman for the health and environment 
department 
health officials have requested that new mexico retailers impose 
a voluntary ban on sales of ltryptophan while the investigation is 
under way 
teams from the federal food and drug administration and the 
centers for disease control came to new mexico thursday to assist 
in the investigation 
personnel from health departments office of epidemiology and 
the fda will be working during the weekend to contact the confirmed 
cases ms hunter said on friday 
they will be getting the patients tryptophan and then going 
back to the location where they purchased it and getting samples of 
the product for testing ms hunter said 
the fda will be doing a broad spectrum of tests she said 
some of the things they might be looking for are heavy metals or 
other organic contaminants 
eosinophilia occurs when there is an abnormally high number of 
eosinophils a type of white cell in the blood 
sixteen people died in 1986 nationwide as a result of 
hypereosinophilic syndrome a form of eosiniphilia and 12 died in 
1987 said sandy smith of the national center for heath statistics 
in washington dc 
all of the eosinophilia cases in new mexico suffered severe 
muscle pain ten of the patients required hospital treatment and as 
of friday one patient a 51yearold woman from gallup remained 
hospitalized in albuquerque 
dr gerald gleich of the mayo clinic said both the missouri and 
mississippi patients had taken ltryptophan 
the thing thats unusual is seeing so many patients with the 
same pattern gleich said whats different is there are so 
many at one time and theyre all taking ltryptophan

who shepherded the automaker from the gloomy financial days of 1980 
to huge profits last year said friday he would retire march 1 
petersen 63 will be succeeded as chairman and chief executive 
officer by vice chairman and chief operating officer harold poling 
who described his predecessor as a visionary leader poling 
64 will be chairman for three years 
i have been chief operating officer or chief executive officer 
for 10 years and i think that it is time for me to make a change 
in my life petersen said his eyes misting as he spoke at a news 
conference 
during his decade at ford the nations secondlargest automaker 
staged a remarkable comeback 
petersen was elected ford president in march 1980 by the end of 
the year the automaker lost 15 billion eight years later after 
costcutting streamlining and payroll shrinking ford posted a 
53 billion profit 
i do want to thank the 367000 ford employees for everything 
they have done these past 10 years to bring our company from the 
depths of our difficulties at the beginning of this decade to the 
sound footing upon which it stands today petersen said 
during the 1980s ford embarked on ambitious and at the time 
risky car development programs that resulted in the ford taurus and 
mercury sable cars they helped paved the way for modern 
aerodynamiclooking cars 
succeeding poling as chief operating officer will be philip 
benton who will become corporate president that title was dropped 
when poling became vice chairman in october 1987 
im surprised that petersen is retiring early said analyst 
kathleen heaney of nikko securities co international inc in new 
york city i think he poling is really going to sit there and 
wait it out for the next chairman 
petersen joined ford in 1949 and held a variety of positions in 
domestic and international product planning design and marketing 
before he became president polings ford career began in 1951 and 
focused mainly on the financial side of the corporation 
poling said his goal during the next three years is to continue 
current programs at ford 
during petersens tenure the company branched out and became 
heavily involved in financial acquisitions capped last month with 
the completion of the purchase of associates corp for 335 
billion 
fords acquisitions spilled over into the automotive sector 
too it bought aston martin in 1987 and bid 25 billion last month 
for jaguar ford officials have said they hope the jaguar 
acquisition is completed by the end of the year

east germanys decision to open its borders to the west brought 
accolades from world leaders tempered with caution from some and 
words of warning against too swift a move to reform 
hungarys socialist party annnounced its support of east 
germanys action and ferenc kosa a member the partys presidium 
said the reforms now under way in east germany will contribute to 
the unfolding democratization in the whole region 
hungary had been concerned about east german insensitivity to 
hungarys own reforms before the replacement of east germanys 
hardline leader erich honecker last month by egon krenz 
on sept 10 hungary opened its borders to east germans wishing 
to emigrate to the west and tens of thousands used this route to 
flee their country before the dramatic announcement thursday that 
they would be permitted to travel straight to the west from east 
germany 
in warsaw solidarity leader lech walesa told the polish news 
agency pap the changes in east germany should have been taken 
much earlier 
the drama of the events in east germany is the result of 
earlier neglect as usually happens when someone misses the train 
of history walesa said 
czechoslovak foreign ministry spokesman lubomir marsik said the 
opening of the east german border represents a positive 
solution 
the situation was getting difficult for everybody including 
czechoslovakia he said referring to the thousands of east 
germans who previously were forced to go west via a third country 
often czechoslovakia 
the united states britain and france offered their military 
camps in west germany to handle the expected flood of people from 
the east 
french president francois mitterrand said moves toward freedom 
and democracy in eastern europe open a new phase in european 
history and added he hoped to visit east germany 
in portugal the us ambassador to the north atlantic treaty 
organization william h taft iv rejected speculation about 
reunification and said the changes under way in eastern europe 
increase the risk of instability 
but soviet foreign minister eduard shevardnandze called the 
border opening a reasonable and sensible decision and added 
that moscow was not worried that the pace of events in eastern 
europe was a threat 
foreign ministry spokesman gennady i gerasimov however said 
the soviet union was concerned about instability brought on by the 
exodus of east germans to the west 
gerasimov stressed the border between east and west germany 
remained in force and that eased travel restrictions should not be 
taken as heralding the imminent reunification of the two germanies 
split since the end of world war ii 
he warned that west germany should take into account that 
policies aimed at reconsidering borders would not suit any 
government in europe and would cause only mistrust 
it was a great day for freedom said british prime minister 
margaret thatcher but the fast pace of reforms in east germany 
called for keeping a very cool head and being very steady and 
being very practical about it she added 
asked about the possibility of reunification she replied you 
are going much too fast you have to take these things step by 
step the first thing is to get a genuine multiparty democracy in 
east germany the prime minister said 
prime minister harri holkeri of finland told finnish radio as 
far as i can see the final outcome of world war ii still stands 
and the situation will not change because of these developments 
the belgian government calling the move a victory for freedom 
and democratic ideals also urged caution 
mark eyskens the belgian foreign minister said those who 
demand new frontiers are irresponsible measured progress is 
required to avoid anarchy 
also speaking in brussels the european economic community 
external affairs commissioner hans andriessen said the east 
european nations were not yet ready for eec membership 
but french foreign minister roland dumas said the thawing of 
eastern europe creates obligations for the eec 
the west should reflect on these two or three new pieces of 
data which are going to change the face of europe and probably the 
global balance dumas said 
the west was now called upon to stretch out its hand even 
further for cooperation to remove the economic deficit in east 
europe said austrian chancellor franz vranitzky 
the spanish government called for free elections and said east 
germanys decision opens a path of hope in the democratic 
development of europe 
nato secretarygeneral manfred woerner said we see this event 
as part of an inevitable process which must lead to further reform 
free elections and full selfdetermination by the population

baltimore officials agreed friday to take back 
a trainload of sewage sludge after authorities in louisiana and 
mississippi refused to let a disposal company unload the pooh 
pooh choochoo in their states 
mayor kurt schmoke felt that although baltimore was not legally 
obligated to take back the nonhazardous waste shipment it did have 
a moral obligation to do so said george balog the citys public 
works director 
the first of the 63 carloads will begin arriving in about nine 
days at the back river waste treatment plant that produced the 
sludge he said the 5000 tons of sludge will be treated with lime 
and then transferred to a facility that will mix the waste with 
leaves and sell it as compost he said 
back river is under a court order to reduce a backlog of sludge 
at the plant 
the cost of returning the sludge to baltimore will be borne by 
gsx chemical services of columbia sc balog said 
gsx contracted with the city to dispose of the sludge and 
initially sent it to its waste treatment facility in white castle 
la but residents of assumption parish complained vehemently about 
the stench 
the company moved the train to moss point in southeast 
mississippi on nov 3 but mississippi officials threatened to fine 
gsx 2 million a day if the company didnt take it out of the state 
gsx will get a chance to challenge the fines during a hearing 
nov 21 
private landfills in a number of states were willing to accept 
the shipment but public officials refused to allow the waste in 
balog said 
the permitted landfills are there he said however 
because of this particular issue of this sludge train it became so 
controversial that state officials did not want to accept it 
in arkansas the pollution control and ecology department 
obtained a temporary restraining order thursday preventing a 
landfill in arkansas county from accepting the sludge

a solitary building stands on the far corner of 
the once teeming and elegant potsdamer platz now a desolate no 
mans land overlooking a jagged corner of the berlin wall 
potsdamer platz will soon regain at least a semblance of its 
former prominence after 28 years as a cold war curiosity east 
german officials said friday 
devastated during world war ii and long a lonely tourist 
attraction for a glimpse over the berlin wall potsdamer platz will 
shortly become another major transit checkpoint between east and 
west berlin 
its opening comes as part of east berlins decision to open its 
borders to the west officials say 
since the berlin wall was built in 1961 potsdamer platz and 
similar landmarks have been sober reminders of the brutal division 
of the city and the two germanys 
for many berliners the blockaded brandenburg gate and potsdamer 
platz are the starkest symbols of that division in both cases two 
main thoroughfares end abrubtly at the concrete base of the 
imposing graffitismeared wall 
when foreign minister hansdietrich genscher of west germany 
told a rally in west berlin that the east germans had decided to 
punch a hole through the wall at potsdamer platz the crowd roared 
with applause and cheers 
another famous crossing has also taken on new tasks 
berlins glienicke bridge a frequent site of eastwest swaps of 
spies and political prisoners has since been opened to accommodate 
more travelers 
another notorious stretch of the wall is also to be opened 
bernauer strasse where scenes of dramatic escape attempts stunned 
the world 28 years ago 
a house near the new checkpoint still stands with its 
westwardfacing windows boarded and sealed with bricks testimony 
to the first desperate attempts to jump to freedom as the wall was 
going up 
nearby others died later in escape attempts that ended in a 
hail of bullets eighty people died trying to cross the wall 
the walls most famous crossing checkpoint charlie will remain 
in use for foreign visitors although east german border guards 
have allowed scores of east berliners to use the crossing since 
travel restrictions were lifted on friday 
no plans have surfaced so far to tear down the concrete barriers 
that stand in front of the massive 18thcentury brandenburg gate 
which for decades has been a rallying point of protest against the 
citys partition

defense secretary tom king said in an interview 
published friday that it would be lunacy for britain to renounce 
its longstanding policy of strong defenses in the face of eastern 
bloc reform and disarmament 
britains independent nuclear deterrent could not be submitted 
as a bargaining factor at eastwest disarmament talks for the 
foreseeable future he said in the interview with the domestic 
british news agency press association 
repeating what prime minister margaret thatcher has said on 
previous occasions king stressed that britain and nato needed to 
maintain their guard against sovietled warsaw pact forces and said 
he believed the british public would understand this pa reported 
it said he also pointed to difficulties being faced at eastwest 
talks on conventional arms reductions in vienna and warned there 
was a considerable way to go in this area 
britain and france are the only two west european nations who 
have their own nuclear forces independent of the the north atlantic 
treaty organizations nuclear arsenal 
britain plans to update its ageing submarineborne polaris 
nuclear missiles by the mid1990s with a more powerful trident 
system bought from the united states 
pa quoted king as saying it is true the present tremendous 
changes might make some people think we dont need defense any 
more but it is a very human emotion to see your own country 
properly defended 
he said events in eastern europe and the soviet union were 
happening fast and it was impossible to predict how they would turn 
out pa reported 
it quoted him as saying progress had been achieved by 
maintaining strong defenses to ensure that freedom in the west was 
not overwhelmed by communist pressures and intimidation 
by being prepared to maintain strong defenses we have seen 
this opportunity for improvement the one thing which would be 
lunacy and almost criminal would be just at this moment to change 
our approach which could damage this process of reform pa 
reported him as saying 
we must keep our defenses strong but respond in a positive and 
constructive way to the approaches from the soviet union and the 
warsaw pact 
pa said the interview by its defense correspondent charles 
miller was conducted in london thursday 
britains opposition labor party this year shed its votelosing 
policy of unilateral nuclear disarmament in favor of a 
multilateralist stance under this a labor government would only 
scrap britains independent nuclear force in a negotiated arms 
control deal 
political analysts say labors defense policy change is a main 
reason for the current surge in the partys fortunes labor has 
lost three successive elections to mrs thatchers governing 
conservative party since 1979 but now leads the conservatives by up 
to 12 points in opinion polls 
mrs thatcher said labors new defense policy was merely a form 
of words to see the party through the next general election due by 
mid1992

president bush promised friday to seize 
every chance to promote democracy in turbulent eastern europe but 
secretary of state james a baker iii ruled out substantial western 
aid for east germany until there is political pluralism across 
the board 
bush traveling in texas noted the spectacle of berliners 
hacking at the wall that divides their city with hammers and 
chisels and the opening of 18 crossings in the wall and said he was 
surprised at the speed of change 
the accelerating torrent of change in previously closed 
societies offers us all much hope and deserves our continued 
encouragement bush said in a dallas speech 
white house press secretary marlin fitzwater said west german 
chancellor helmut kohl spoke with bush by telephone for 18 minutes 
and gave him a thorough briefing on the first part of his trip to 
poland and on developments in east germany 
bush congratulated kohl on his handling of the east german 
situation and promised the full cooperation of the united 
states 
the two agreed that these dramatic developments make the malta 
meeting between bush and soviet president mikhail gorbachev even 
more important and agreed to consult closely between now and the 
meeting fitzwater said he said they would talk again next week 
speaking a day after the east german government announced a 
lifting of all travel restrictions and just before news arrived of 
a promise of free elections in east germany bush said we will 
seize every opportunity to contribute to lasting peace and to 
extend democracy 
bush offered no specifics as to future policy saying only that 
he would be guided by prudence and imagination 
but in remarks at a fundraising dinner for texas gov bill 
clements the president sounded a note of restraint 
the best way to keep america and the west free is to keep the 
united states of america strong bush said 
this country must not base its foreign policy or its national 
security on the aspirations of one man inside the soviet union or 
anywhere else 
bush departed from his text to add were living in exciting 
times the rapidity of change is mindboggling and i will do my 
level best to conduct an imaginative foreign policy but i will be 
prudent i will do my best to move freedom forward 
he said kohl asked me to share with the american people his 
conviction that this remarkable change thats taking place in 
eastern europe most recently in the german democratic republic 
could never have taken place without the steadfast loyal support of 
the united states of america 
as the president was speaking the central committee of the east 
german communist party was promising free elections freedom of 
association and assembly supervision of security forces by 
parliament and an end to official privileges 
egon krenz the new party general secretary told a rally we 
have a great task before us a revolution on german soil 
baker hinted at a goslow approach toward east germany 
theres a long way to go before there is true freedom and true 
political pluralism in east germany baker said on abcs good 
morning america 
baker while calling the east german decision to open its 
borders the most dramatic event in eastwest relations since 
the end of world war ii said the united states and other allies 
believe any discussion of an aid program now would be premature 
the allies he said will be much more forthcoming about helping 
east germany only if there is political pluralism across the 
board 
baker said freedom to travel must be followed by other steps 
before there can be a serious discussion of a united germany 
in another television appearance on macneillehrer newshour 
on public television baker said this would never have happened 
of course wim zol4yy

hzte administration 
was too cautious baker said we are extraordinarily happy about 
it 
comments in official washington all day mixed caution with 
exaltation 
housing and urban development secretary jack kemp traveling 
with the president captured some of the exaltation in reporting on 
a conversation with bush during the flight to dallas 
we talked about east germany and the thrill in our hearts and 
minds of all people everywhere over whats happening with the 
crumbling of the berlin wall he said 
we cannot house the world said kemp but we can 
definitely do our best to be compassionate and help west germany 
cope with the flood of refugees from the east 
while some analysts predicted that some possible changes in 
europe could mean the breakup of nato us officials like defense 
secretary dick cheney did not go that far but conceded there 
would be changes in the alliance 
meanwhile important senators welcomed the changes in east 
germany and called for further liberalization including free 
elections 
east germanys ambassador gerhard herder said he found 
president bushs reaction to the events in berlin encouraging 
but warned that any miscalculation in the western reaction could 
lead to bigger conflicts 
in a speech at the national press club herder promised that 
east germany would be a predictable partner for the west 
he noted that the east german armed forces are only a short 
distance away from the american british and french forces 
stationed in west berlin 
by any miscalculation they could be involved this could lead 
to a conflict he said 
asked whether he could foresee a unified germany herder 
replied in my dreams yes but being a politician i dont see 
any prospect for a united germany because the two germanies are 
members of opposing alliances 
the only action taken by the bush administration has been an 
offer of all possible assistance to the west german government 
as it struggles to cope with the flood of refugees the pentagon 
said it was making available housing for 980 people in three 
offbase installations 
were we surprised by the speed of it baker asked in a 
separate interview on cbs you bet your life 
sen claiborne pell dri chairman of the senate foreign 
relations committee said in a statement east germany should 
also hold truly democratic elections 
sen richard lugar rind a former committee chairman said 
the east german authorities may be intent on getting rid of the 
bad eggs before moving to restore the hardline system 
defense secretary dick cheney said the very positive 
changes if they led to noncommunist governments in the east 
would mean less of a threat and that in turn might portend 
some changes on our side 
one change said retired gen bernard rogers a former nato 
commander would be fewer us troops in europe there are 340000 
now and a revision in the forward strategy that puts fighting 
units close to the border

americans expect greater wealth in the 1990s 
but also greater crime they see better days for their schools but 
worsening pollution in their skies they think theyll be smoking 
less and doing drugs more 
one of the most widely held expectations for the next decade is 
for a democrat to win the white house a national survey by media 
general and the associated press has found among the 
leastexpected developments the demise of communism 
in the broadest measures many respondents expressed optimism 
about the future roughly six in 10 expected life for others to 
improve in the next decade and threequarters saw their own lives 
getting better 
but there were sobering assessments on some issues more than 
six in 10 expected pollution and crime to worsen and almost as 
many saw more aids homelessness and world hunger as the year 2000 
approaches 
the environment stood out as a chief concern twelve percent 
expected pollution to be the nations greatest problem a decade 
from now only drug abuse was named by more 17 percent 
moreover 65 percent expected pollution to worsen in the next 10 
years and almost half said the warming of the atmosphere because 
of pollution known as the greenhouse effect could threaten human 
survival 
education conversely was a bright spot fiftyeight percent 
expected it to improve in the next decade personal wealth also was 
a point of optimism with 56 percent expecting their familys 
financial situation to improve 
but respondents divided about evenly when asked whether they 
expected the us economy to improve worsen or remain about the 
same and 52 percent expected the federal budget deficit to worsen 
younger respondents in many cases were the most pessimistic and 
optimism often increased with age for example 52 percent of those 
aged 1824 expected the united states to become involved in a war 
in the next decade while just 41 percent of their elders shared 
their fear and among the oldest group over 64 years old just 27 
percent expected war 
similarly six in 10 in the youngest group expected drug abuse 
to worsen and twothirds of them saw acquired immune deficiency 
syndrome as a growing problem while nearer to half of the older 
respondents said so 
the most widely expected eventualities were a democrat winning 
the presidency which 72 percent called likely cigarette smokers 
shrinking to a tiny minority of the population which 59 percent 
called likely and much greater restrictions on abortion which 
were expected by 56 percent 
the poll found a lowering of some expectations in the past 
decade in a 1979 survey by the roper organization 51 percent 
expected the fourday work week to become common in the 1980s when 
the question was repeated in the new poll just 41 percent held 
that expectation for the 1990s 
expectations also changed on energy issues fewer people now 
expect new energy sources to end dependency on oil 49 percent 
compared with 60 percent in 1979 and more expect the role of 
nuclear power to decline 45 percent now compared with 33 percent 
10 years ago 
more people are dubious that racial and religious discrimination 
could largely disappear 77 percent think not compared with 66 
percent in 1979 in both polls nine in 10 doubted that poverty 
will be almost eliminated 
other possibilities were expected by sizable groups though not 
majorities slightly more than onethird said it was likely the 
republican party would win control of congress in the 1990s nearly 
four in 10 expected a woman to be elected president 42 percent 
called it likely us astronauts will reach mars and 42 percent 
expected cures for cancer and for aids 
on international affairs 46 percent expected terrorism to 
worsen with the rest roughly divided between its improving or 
remaining about the same and regardless of prodemocracy movements 
in many communist countries 70 percent called it unlikely that 
communism will largely disappear in the 1990s

irans islamic revolution and the war in 
afghanistan have made africa a major smuggling route for southwest 
asias heroin most of it is finding its way to europe but some 
goes to the united states 
africans latching on to the trafficking are finding the money is 
too good to resist particularly on a continent with a high 
unemployment rate and serious ecomomic problems the wholesale 
price for a kilogram 22 pounds of pure heroin is about 150000 
and for an african trying to scrape by the temptation might be too 
great 
that is one reason the united states has begun to help african 
authorities combat trafficking even though most of the heroin 
winds up in europe us officials are concerned that if 
trafficking takes greater hold in africa it could bring new 
instability to the continent 
the heroin comes from pakistan and afghanistan and interpol 
the international police organization says 236 africans were 
arrested and 1160 pounds of heroin seized last year in pakistan 
india africa and europe 
that represents a sharp increase since 1984 when interpol 
recorded the arrests of only 11 africans carrying 105 pounds of 
heroin in africa asia and europe 
while interpol is unable to estimate the amount of the heroin 
moving through africa it says the number of africans arrested in 
1988 indicates it has been sharply on the rise 
previously southwest asian nationals smuggled heroin to europe 
overland through iran turkey and the balkan countries some was 
diverted to india and pakistan and later smuggled to europe by air 
or sea 
however the overland route was disrupted by the soviet military 
intervention in afghanistan in 1979 and a ruthless crackdown on 
drugs by irans islamic leaders 
with the traditional route blocked traffickers turned to africa 
but african governments were illequipped and too inexperienced 
in the narcotics trade to deal effectively with the problem 
peter masemo head of kenyas antinarcotics squad said for 
example at first we didnt know what we were looking for 
in an effort to stop the heroin from reaching their streets 
western governments including britain as well as the united 
states now are helping the african nations 
in september the bush administration sent thomas r pickering 
the us ambassador to the united nations to persuade nigeria to 
renew an agreement under which the united states assists the west 
african nations antidrugs effort an agreement was signed in 
washington soon after 
a month later britain and nigeria signed a similar pact 
interpol figures indicate the majority of the african 
traffickers are from nigeria ghana tanzania mali and gambia 
but no african nation is unaffected by the trafficking of 
southwest asia heroin says joseph e fortier head of interpols 
drugs subdivision 
the heroin enters africa by air and sea mainly through eastern 
countries with kenya egypt and ethiopia favored because of 
frequent connecting flights to west africa 
in west africa the drug is repackaged and carried by individual 
couriers or hidden in freight shipments to western europe or north 
america 
interpol says the smugglers use all major airports in western 
europe however an enterprising few have slipped through east 
european airports including moscow east berlin and warsaw 
the seriousness of the problem was underlined in june at an 
interpolsponsored meeting in nairobi narcotics agents from 25 
countries in africa asia europe and north america attended the 
closeddoor meeting 
we concluded the situation was increasingly getting worse 
said an african participant who spoke only on condition of 
anonymity we also felt african governments cant fight the drugs 
menace alone we need assistance 
al unger a state department spokesman in washington says the 
united states spent at least 124000 in 1987 and 1988 to help 
fight the trafficking 
the money bought vehicles communications and drugdetecting 
equipment as well as sniffer dogs and paid for the training of 
narcotics agents customs agents and judicial officers 
the beneficiaries included kenya nigeria ivory coast and 
cameroon in addition sudan niger kenya and togo each received 
drugs testing kits worth between 200 and 300 each last year 
the united states also is planning a 75000 west african 
contraband customs school for benin guinea niger senegal and 
togo a similar one for englishspeaking nigeria and ghana would 
cost 40000 unger says

herik othieno an 
environmentalist is pretty sure the greenhouse effect has come to 
his kenya homeland because malarial mosquitos native to the hot 
lowlands have migrated to the cool highlands 
with temperatures rising worldwide there are strong 
indications that their presence is one of the results of the 
greenhouse effect othieno said in an interview here 
for many third world nations troubled by fragile economies and 
substandard agricultural sectors the greenhouse effects global 
warming will have grave consequences environmental experts warned 
here recently at an international conference on the greenhouse 
effect 
while industrialized countries have the scientific potential to 
find technological solutions to the problem and the money to pay 
for them most developing nations are unable to cope with it 
unfortunately they do not have the means said celso roque 
head of the philippine delegation to the 68nation conference 
some experts believe global warming which amounted to a 
15degree fahrenheit rise in the average worldwide temperature 
over the past century is caused mainly by the carbon dioxide 
emissions from power plants factories and cars in the 
industrialized world 
at the noordwijk conference delegates adopted a resolution 
calling for stabilization of carbon dioxide emissions as soon as 
possible 
but the two largest industrialized nations the united states 
and japan refused to commit themselves to the year 2000 as the 
date by which stabilization should be implemented 
many scientists predict that if the emissions and those of 
other gases associated with the greenhouse effect continue the 
pace of global warming could increase four to sevenfold in the next 
century 
i predict the third world will be hardest hit by such a rise 
in temperatures said the american environmentalist dan becker of 
the washingtonbased sierra club 
think of their current unstable food situation it can only 
get worse as their agricultural sectors collapse under 
environmental pressure becker told a reporter outside the 
conference room 
many experts among them kenyas othieno believe the greenhouse 
effect will ultimately lead to a vast increase in desert areas 
some experts also predict that lowlying coastal and delta 
nations such as bangladesh could be inundated as the sea level 
rises as a result of the melting polar ice caps 
we may suppose that the absence of rains and the 
unpredictable character of the weather in general are initial 
signs of the greenhouse effect said othieno a staff member of a 
nairobibased environmentalist group called energy and environment 
organization 
roque of the philippines painted a gloomy picture of a third 
world hit by droughts precipitated by the greenhouse effect 
crop lands will turn into deserts there will be more forest 
fires hydroelectric dams and irrigation systems will be 
rendered useless roque told delegates 
continued global warming could result in an ominous change in 
the oceans he said ocean currents will be modified with 
unpredictable consequences for world fisheries 
many conference officials from developing nations said the 
industrialized world where 65 percent of all greenhouserelated 
emissions originate should take the lead in reversing the trend 
the incessant largescale burning of nonrenewable fossil 
fuels in the north is ecologically disgraceful roque said 
delegates here also agreed to set up a fund to help developing 
nations cope not only with the consequences of climate change but 
also with one of its major causes destruction of tropical rain 
forests 
we must protect the scant natural resources we have in the 
third world othieno said 
that involves more than just conservation for there are also 
pressing social and economic dimensions roque noted 
population growth drives the impoverished landless peasants 
into forest lands where they slash and burn the forests to eke out 
a living he said 
the pressure to generate foreign exchange for the heavy debt 
payments and the political necessity of providing employment 
justify commercial logging

for 45yearold savitri devi the routine 
of cooking drawing water from the well cleaning her onestory 
brick house and taking an afternoon nap soon will be broken but 
only for a time 
later this month millions like devi in indias farming villages 
will decide who should govern their country 
the burden of choosing rests lightly on devis shoulders 
ill vote for whomever my husband votes for she says in 
hindi sitting in the warmth of the sun on a rope cot outside her 
home 
more than threefourths of indias 498 million voters live in 
villages making the rural vote the most important electoral bank 
for any party in the elections for parliament and prime minister 
nov 22 24 and 26 
devi expresses resentment at the governing congress party which 
she blames for the high price of sugar and the cutting down of the 
forest outside the village 
the men of sanoli a village of 2000 people 70 miles southwest 
of new delhi talk of wider issues but their political leanings 
soon escalate into arguments 
the village is in the northern state of rajasthan and has 
usually been considered a congress party stronghold 
these people do not know what they are talking about says 
72yearold hari krishan sharma the village priest referring to a 
group of villagers who derided his support for the congress party 
i am a wise elephant surrounded by barking dogs 
what will you give water to to a tree firmly planted in the 
soil or to a sapling which will be blown away in the next storm 
the question was intended to illustrate prime minister rajiv 
gandhis promise of stable government the firmly planted tree 
if he and his congress party are returned to power 
but others sitting on a raised platform outside the village 
temple were unconvinced 
budh ram a wiry mustachioed farmer said two years of rule by 
the opposition had given more to the village than the 39 years of 
rule by the congress party 
we voted the congress to power in the last elections the 
candidate is my sisters brotherinlaw but he hasnt visited the 
village once in these five years hell be routed this time ram 
said 
only senile old men like him will vote for the congress now 
he said gesturing toward sharma 
usually divided opposition parties have united for the second 
time in history to fight the congress party 
the previous attempt was briefly successful when the opposition 
dislodged the congress party from power in 1977 ousting rajiv 
gandhis mother indira gandhi from the prime ministers office 
but the fragile unity soon disentegrated and midterm polls were 
called in 1980 which were won by the congress party and mrs 
gandhi returned and was assassinated four years later 
the opposition is focusing this year on its charges of 
corruption and inept leadership by rajiv gandhi who succeeded his 
mother in 1984 
the viewpoint has been brought to sanoli by wordofmouth or 
read in newspapers by the few literate people in the village 
television and radio are controlled by the state and little 
antigovernement news is broadcast 
the people tilling the fields go to sleep hungry ram said 
the congress lives luxuriously and spends fortunes in hotels 
where has the money from bofors gone 
the reference was to opposition charges that senior congress 
politicians and government officials received millions of dollars 
in kickbacks from the swedish firm ab bofors for a 14 billion 
contract to supply artillery to the indian army 
the charges have become a rallying cry for the opposition 
gandhi has denied the charges and says he is not personally 
involved 
another issue is the governments involvement in the ethnic 
strife in neighboring sri lanka where at least 1100 indian 
soldiers sent to restore peace have been killed in fighting tamil 
rebels 
the issue is live in sanoli because five young men from the 
village have died in sri lanka 
gandhi sent our children to sri lanka said sher singh who 
runs a small grocery store why did we have to go to another 
mans home i dont blame the sri lankans ill kill anyone who 
interferes in my home

baltimore and washington once shared little 
besides i95 the american league and eastern time baltimore was 
bluecollar muscle washington whitecollar power there were 
orioles and colts fans and there were senators and redskins fans 
now there is allan fleming who lives in this community near the 
divide in the washingtonbaltimore commutersheds hes a real big 
orioles fan and a dyedinthewool redskins fan says flemings 
wife pepper 
hes also a resident of baltwash one name for the continuously 
populated region of 6 million people stretching from northcentral 
virginia to eastern west virginia to the pennsylvania line 
the 1990 census will almost certainly redefine greater 
washington and baltimore as one consolidated metropolitan 
statistical area the largest merger of metropolitan areas in 
world history according to census bureau demographer richard 
forstall 
when the century began americans lived in isolated spots of 
farmland and open country or huddled together in central cities 
and towns as it moves into its last decade they are sprawling out 
in all directions 
metropolitan areas are bumping into each other says peter 
muller a university of miami urban geographer its been 
happening for years but now you can really see it 
you can see it in the region between boston and washington 
where megalopolis the vast city forecast by jean gottman 30 
years ago now includes 25 continguous metropolitan areas and 
onesixth of the nations population 
the census bureau says the four most advanced sections of 
megalopolis are bostonprovidence new yorkphiladelphia 
harrisburgyork pa and washingtonbaltimore within each 
section substantial numbers of people live in one metro area and 
commute to another 
the metropolitan economies of baltimore and washington are the 
most tightly entwined here in columbia 24 miles from the 
washington monument 14 from baltimores inner harbor couples like 
bob and susan klukas rise each morning and head off in opposite 
directions she toward baltimore he toward washington 
their big city loyalties are mixed they read both the sun and 
the post but susan says theyre more apt to visit downtown 
baltimore which is an easier drive 
fellow columbians pepper and allan fleming on the other hand 
find themselves attending more social functions in washington 
where he is an executive at the washington times 
residents of baltwash exult in the areas great variety of 
goods services and attractions you can take in opera at 
washingtons kennedy center one night and visit the national 
aquarium in baltimore the next day when washingtons baseball 
senators and baltimores football colts defected the sting was 
eased by the presence of the pro teams that remained 
each of the merging metro areas is becoming more economically 
diverse washington is known for bureaucracy but its immediate 
suburbs have many hightech industries baltimores skyline is now 
characterized not by smokestacks but office towers 
others see a darker side to baltwash when columbia resident 
howard knudson was growing up in the suburbs west of baltimore 
there was still plenty of open space now says his wife jean 
the traffic is awful and every square inch has something on it 
houses townhouses or apartments 
baltwash or washbalt is just one part of the emerging 
megalopolis new york and philadelphia are meeting in bucks county 
pa princeton nj and along the highways leading to the 
delaware river northern new jersey muller notes is beginning 
to fill in there are no real breaks in the urban landscape 
although the city of boston has fewer than 600000 people and 
covers only 47 square miles its metropolitan domain stretches 
north into new hampshire west to worcester and south to rhode 
island boston has been doing this for so long marvels 
forstall of the census bureau it absorbed cambridge in the 1800s 
and never looked back 
a continent away los angeles and san diego are on a collision 
course as new housing clusters pop up in the arid expanses between 
them the san francisco bay area has become one vast metropolis in 
which san franciscans comprise only 13 percent of the population 
specialists debate how far and fast this expansion will go but 
rutgers urban affairs expert george sternlieb says one thing is 
clear the united states is decentralizing faster than any 
society in history 
arthur c nelson a planner at georgia tech says his research 
shows that if present trends continue by 2020 or 2030 almost half 
of the mainland could be classified exurban places where 
people live on five 10 or even 30acre tracts and drive fairly 
long distances to jobs social engagements and other destinations 
the only land with nothing on or near it he says will be 
governmentowned or undevelopable such as mountains and flood 
plains 
nelson is struck by the speed with which industry is moving 
beyond the urban periphery once manufacturers needed to be near 
the citys workers and rail lines but now tax laws and land prices 
encourage them to spread out as long as they remain within a days 
truck ride of the city 
that requires limitedaccess highways of which the nation has 
plenty federal transportation planner douglass lee says onethird 
of the interstates carry fewer than 8000 vehicles a day enough 
to fill only a twolane street for every i95 busy from florida 
to maine there is an i88 virtually empty from albany to 
binghamton ny 
such routes do not serve american settlement they spread it 
look at the map of the interstate system says rutgers 
historian robert fishman and you will see the future of the 
american city 
in other words the future lies in such places as ulster county 
ny and loudon county va where the city dweller now still can 
find the balm of open space 
the walls seem to be closing in gertrude stein once observed 
from the vantage point of crowded paris that in the united 
states there is more room where nobody is than where everybody is 
that is what makes america what it is 
or was

in the beginning there was joan ganz cooney and 
a secretary then came big bird bert and ernie the cookie monster 
and more they still ask if you can tell them please how to get 
to sesame street 
millions of kids many of whom now are adults know the way 
well the series starts its 21st year today on public tv having 
grown to a staff of 92 including 10 actors and 13 muppet players 
for some time now its audience has been more than american its 
englishlanguage version is seen in more than 80 countries and it 
has 15 international coproductions its makers say 
but its still aimed at kids aged 1 through 5 particularly 
those of poor innercity families and the goal of the onehour 
series is the same now as in 1969 to teach as well as entertain 
now costing 12 million annually to make 80 per cent of that 
from commercial licensing of its characters and 20 per cent from 
pbs stations according to its makers it began with definite 
marching orders 
i said lets do a kind of laughin for kids recalls 
cooney the founder and since 1988 chairwoman of the childrens 
television workshop maker of sesame street and subsequent 
teachthetykes shows 
her walk to sesame street began when she was a tv consultant 
for the carnegie corporation a foundation she joined after writing 
a study called the potential uses of television in preschool 
education 
when she left to start the show she told its producers it 
should have animation puppets a studio and lets not have a 
single host lets have at least four hosts who will be men women 
black white hispanic and so on 
having decreed a prejesse jackson rainbow coalition she also 
wanted each show periodically interrupted by noncommercials to 
teach letters and numbers the basiceducation snippets that 
still air on the show 
and the installation of jim hensons muppets was a very 
critical decision in the shows success says cooney a former 
reporter from phoenix ariz who also has been an nbc publicist 
and public tv documentary maker 
interestingly hensons kermit the frog never was a regular 
he only was a guest visitor a ctw spokeswoman says and he still 
hops in now and then 
there have been some additions and changes the biggest of the 
latter the expanded range of what cooney calls curriculum aims 
among other things todays street watchers get a taste of 
math and science 
and cooney says they also see teenagers a student from 
japan and people with various disabilities from downs syndrome 
to hearing and vision problems there also are segments on emotions 
weve dealt with death with love and marriage with pregnancy 
and childbirth with adoption with anger she says we also 
have a goal of teaching children to cooperate we consciously 
model the acceptance of all people of treating people kindly 
like oscar the grouch cooney can get a tad testy but mainly at 
those who say the fast pace of sesame street has led to the mtv 
generation of short attention spans a bum rap she submits 
street has longer pieces now she says with virtually every 
show given a plotted story line all the way through that is 
interrupted only for the educational noncommercials 
we didnt make mtv possible she says she thought she had 
made it clear in many speeches she adds that we followed 
laughin we followed the revolution of tv we did not create the 
revolution in television 
a recent development the cable monster and such 
childgetting cable channels as nickelodeon and its bugs bunny 
and road runner reruns have had an impact on the street 
audience but only in the afternoon she says 
our sesame street morning audience is not affected and 
thats always been our biggest audience she says not so in the 
afternoon when the preschoolers older brothers and sisters come 
home from school 
they tend to take over the set with cable added to their 
viewing choices the competition is strong not only against 
street but also ctws olderkids math show square one tv 
and its science show 321 contact 
as it starts this seasonstreet will portray more 
teenagers and have two new topics the environment and 
geography the latter she says is because we know our children 
are not learning geography 
the former already a semiregular story on network newscasts is 
joining the street cooney says because we feel that for 
their survival the children had better learn about the 
environment

kay lenz wanted to show the special problems 
faced by women with aids in her role on nbcs midnight caller 
and so she talked with those who know best 
the actress who won an emmy for her portrayal of tina cassidy 
met with a support group for women with aids in san francisco the 
episode her third appearance as jack killians former girlfriend 
will be telecast tuesday gary cole stars as killian 
we decided to integrate the support group into the script 
she said they will go on jacks radio show to inform the public 
about the specific problems of women everything these actresses 
say is true because we got it right from the mouths of the support 
group 
the problem is that women dont have the political power that 
men have they dont have the financial power no matter how 
independent a woman is its part of a womans nature to take care 
of others women with aids often have to take care of themselves 
theyre not prepared for this ninety percent of the women i met 
are mothers 
lenz added men with aids deal with friends and lovers women 
deal with family members because often their children may have it 
lenz won an emmy last year as best guest actress in a drama 
series for her role on midnight caller she first played the 
part in the series pilot episode 
the aids episode last year caused considerable controversy in 
san francisco where the series is filmed lenz played a 
heterosexual woman who is infected by a man in the first version 
of the script the man is shot down in the streets protesters felt 
this would make aids victims into targets the script was rewritten 
before it was filmed to eliminate the shooting 
in the current episode tina is near death and jack takes her in 
and comforts her 
this is a very different show said lenz we were taking a 
chance doing it again we consulted many people and the writer 
stephen zito did a lot of research this show also talks about the 
isolation and prejudice attached to aids it comes from ignorance 
and from that comes abandonment and prejudice if i so much as stub 
my toe i want a hug it would be hard for me to imagine being that 
ill and being abandoned 
its the same kind of attitude people had about leprosy in 
biblical times i hope we can reach the people who turn the channel 
whenever aids is mentioned i had a lot of ignorance about aids 
myself before i did this role 
she said jack and tina have a wonderful relationship they 
love each other unconditionally she said i love that it shows 
that people can have relationships they may not work shes lost 
her job as a teacher jack takes her in its a debilitating 
disease but jacks into denial he doesnt want to accept that her 
life will never be the same again nor will his 
when she was first offered the role last year she talked to the 
producers about changing the characters name lenz was formerly 
married to actor david cassidy but they kept the name and it 
didnt bother me at all 
last summer lenz was seen as a police psychiatrist in the usa 
network movie murder by night 
she made her film debut in 1973 as a teenage hippie in 
breezy which starred william holden and was directed by clint 
eastwood she was in the miniseries rich man poor man in 1976 
and the series rich man poor manbook ii 
lenz has been a guest star on such shows as la law 
moonlighting hardball hill street blues and cagney 
amp lacey 
i like doing series work she said im always a different 
character although im usually a victim im usually dying or a 
prostitute or pregnant it allows you to have another life besides 
going to the studio

its about time you received some reassuring 
economic news about stability and less volatility and growing 
standards of living and other good things and it comes from a 
highly credible source 
the decade of the 1990s stands a very good chance of being the 
most prosperous of the century says jerry l jordan who early 
in the 1980s helped produce a us economic forecast that was 
remarkably on target 
ten years is a long time for any forecast but jordan believes 
that there are vast and fundamental changes going on in the world 
that bode well not just for americans but for people everywhere 
among the most basic of those changes he says is a return to 
the market economy versus the corporate state a reliance on 
trade on people rather than governments on what works rather than 
ideology 
everywhere he said people and governments are repealing the 
1930s the model has changed he said 
jordan is senior vice president and chief economist of los 
angelesbased first interstate economics part of the first 
interstate bancorp which has banking affiliates and licensees in 
21 states and the district of columbia 
and he is a former member of president reagans first council of 
economic advisers helping in that role to produce a report back in 
1981 that in some respects became a blueprint for the economy of 
the 1980s 
one brief segment from that economic summary published as the 
economic report of the president early in 1982 
a critical element in this outlook is the assumption that 
inflationary expectations will in fact continue to recede 
if they recede at a relatively fast rate market rates of 
interest will decline significantly wage demands will continue to 
moderate and the proinflationary biases that have developed 
throughout the economy over the past decade will quickly 
disappear 
it was right on the mark but at the time it was made there were 
many doubters 
a large element in the economic fraternity for example 
questioned whether an antiinflationary policy could also be a 
growth policy the 1980s proved it could be now that policy is 
espoused by the chairman of the federal reserve 
it is for such reasons and others not stated that jordans 
longrange economic forecast for the world is worth noting 
early in the forecast is this statement 
the end of more than 40 years of cold war and the victory of 
capitalism and democracy over socialism and totalitarianism in the 
contest of ideas have set the stage for more efficient use of 
global resources 
practicality and common sense are giving way to the recognition 
that market economies outperform centrally directed ones the new 
model is the market economy for the simple reason it has shown it 
can outperform others 
it is there for the world to see europe north america and 
japan have become the three large economic and financial powers a 
few years ago it was unimaginable that certain other nations would 
follow the model now it is so 
in the coming decade economic rivalries among the north 
america european and asian enterprises in a global arena will move 
us further down the path of economic restructuring 
deregulation denationalization privatization and tax reform 
will continue 
freer markets mean that natural comparative advantage will 
bring about greater productivity at a time when demographic trends 
also suggest a more experienced work force in major industrialized 
nations 
jordans conclusion therefore is that the new model will be 
widely copied that productivity will grow and that standards of 
living will rise more rapidly 
meanwhile global markets for financial and real assets and 
also tradable goods will constrain the activities of economic 
policymakers who sometimes have been known to succumb to political 
influence 
instead the foreign exchange equity and bond markets will play 
a policing role helping to lower the amplitude of fluctuations 
in inflation interest rates exchange rates output growth and 
employment 
and he adds this less volatile environment will be conducive 
to higher saving and investment

two hundred thousand soldiers of the 
pakistani army and air force are to hold the biggest military 
exercises in their 42year history starting sometime in 
middecember 
the plan has prompted neighboring india to strengthen its border 
force the two countries have fought three wars since they gained 
independence from britain in 1947 and still are not on the best of 
terms 
brig riaz ullah chief of pakistans inter services public 
relations department said the war games are codenamed zarbe 
momin urdu for the blow of the perfect moslem and will 
test new tactics and weapons 
officials have not disclosed details or announced an exact 
starting date 
riaz said the games will involve one armored division and seven 
infantry divisions in central pakistan at least 120 miles from the 
eastern border with india 
the air force will conduct simultaneous operations under the 
code name highmark 
indian war games along the frontier in january 1987 called 
operation brass tacks triggered a precautionary mobilization 
of pakistani forces 
riaz said the pakistani exercises will be held in a northsouth 
corridor defined by the indus and chenab rivers in western punjab 
province however the area abuts an indiancontrolled section of 
the disputed jammukashmir state 
i dont think these will cause the tensions we saw in 1987 
riaz said 
dilip sinha the first secretary of the indian embassy in 
islamabad said his government agrees 
no we dont see it as a threat he said 
nevertheless a senior indian military officer in southern 
jammukashmir said additional indian troops and tanks were being 
stationed along the border to deal with any eventuality 
the officer who spoke on condition of anonymity said indian 
security forces in jammukashmir would increase from 10000 to 
100000 by the start of the pakistani maneuvers 
we do not want to be caught unaware in case of any possible 
offensive he said 
pakistan which is predominantly moslem has fought three 
unsuccessful wars with mainly hindu india since their partition at 
the end of british colonial rule in 1947 
wars in 1948 and 1965 were over jammukashmir in 1971 the two 
clashed over the establishment of bangladesh as an independent 
nation in what had been east pakistan 
pakistani and indian troops still trade artillery fire across 
the desolate siachen glacier 21000 feet up in the himalayas in 
northern jammukashmir near the chinese border 
pakistan occupies the western third of the 85000squaremile 
state 
the two sides are separated by a diagonal ceasefire line drawn 
in 1949 that is still monitored by a united nations military 
observer group 
gen mirza aslam beg chief of the pakistani army has announced 
that foreign military observers including some from india will be 
invited to watch the exercises 
our exercise is above board and not like the secret 
preparations india made two years ago to conduct its massive 
exercise operation brass tacks beg said

almost four years after he stomped out of a 
cabinet meeting and resigned from margaret thatchers government 
michael heseltine remains the man voted most likely to succeed her 
as britains prime minister 
despite tumbling opinion polls mrs thatcher shows no signs of 
slowing down after 10 years in power however and says she hopes 
to lead the conservatives into one more general election before 
retiring 
heseltine who is 56 years old and has a huge personal fortune 
can afford to wait 
in the meantime the lean 6foot3 heseltine with his 
moviestar good looks is in big demand as a public speaker 
he speaks with a slight lisp suffers from the reading 
impairment dyslexia has great personal charm and despite the 
years out of office ranks among the half dozen bestknown 
politicians in britain 
his thick mane of blond hair and sometimes swashbuckling 
escapades earned him the nickname tarzan and it has stuck he 
once lifted the ceremonial mace in the house of commons and swung 
it around his head and as defense secretary donned fatigues to try 
out new weapons firsthand usually in front of the television 
cameras 
other conservatives in parliament who will eventually select 
mrs thatchers replacement as the party leader in particular 
want him to speak to their local party gatherings 
that will one day enable him to call in the ious the 
spectator magazine said 
heseltine has been careful not to attack mrs thatcher directly 
his usual response when asked whether he wants to succeed her is 
the bland observation that there are 350 conservative members of 
parliament who want to lead the party 
he also has avoided public recriminations about the dispute over 
an obscure helicoptermaker westland plc which led to his 
resignation as defense secretary in january 1986 
heseltine favored a european consortiums rescue bid for the 
ailing company over the eventual winner the american sikorsky 
company but when ordered by mrs thatcher to clear his statements 
with the cabinet he walked out 
she too was nearly forced out when the dispute escalated over 
the leaking by government officials of documents designed to 
discredit heseltines argument 
heseltine who is proeuropean while mrs thatcher is combative 
toward the european economic community and to the left of her 
within the party indulges in coded criticisms of her policies 
he has called for more money to be put into inner city and 
educational reforms and has said mrs thatchers property tax 
which taxes individuals rather than households will become known 
as an unpopular tory tax 
he said the governments last interest rate increase was 
necessary to combat inflation but he told a recent luncheon of 
american journalists that whether we should have got into that 
situation is really the issue 
at the conservative partys annual conference he told the 
government not to let the medicine drag out dissipating our 
economic strength and dispersing our political support 
perhaps most significantly heseltine believes britain should 
join the exchange rate mechanism of the european monetary system 
which limits swings in nine other european currencies 
opinion polls indicate heseltine is the voters choice to 
replace mrs thatcher as the tory leader 
a national opinion poll conducted for the newspaper the mail on 
sunday said 31 percent of 1043 voters questioned believe heseltine 
would be the best person to succeed her the next closest candidate 
was sir geoffrey howe the deputy prime minister with 17 percent 
british broadcasting corp television surveyed conservative 
lawmakers and found 22 percent would like heseltine to succeed mrs 
thatcher followed by 14 percent for party chairman kenneth baker 
heseltine was born in swansea wales the son of an army 
officer and educated at a private boys school and oxford 
university 
at oxford he told friends he would be a millionaire by the age 
of 30 and then go into politics he made a fortune in the 
publishing business before being elected to parliament in 1966 
he and his family own 51 percent of haymarket press and british 
news reports estimate he is worth 60 million pounds 94 million 
he divides his time with his wife anne between an 800acre 
estate north of oxford and an elegant townhouse in londons 
exclusive belgravia neighborhood they have two grown daughters and 
a son

healthconscious americans are on an oats kick 
and us farmers arent keeping up with the demand 
oat bran has become a buzz word says agriculture department 
nutritionist ruth h matthews everybodys got to have oat bran 
youve got to have oat bran in this and that ive seen potato 
chips with oat bran and popcorn and everything else 
us oats production rebounded this year from a droughtlevel 
1988 output of 219 million bushels the lowest since the 
agriculture department began records in 1866 to 371 million 
bushels this year 
but that wont be enough and the united states will wind up in 
198990 importing around 55 million bushels of oats last year 
when drought shriveled yields imports jumped to 68 million bushels 
even before the current craze the united states was importing 
oats from canada sweden finland and argentina now the demand is 
greater than ever 
it was only a few years ago that medical researchers found 
health benefits in foods rich in fiber combined with a reduction 
in the consumption of fats they can help guard against colon 
cancers and high levels levels of serum cholesterol 
oats longrecognized as a nutritious food gained further 
dietary fame as researchers found that certain kinds of fiber 
those that are soluble in water are even more effective 
if you cook oatmeal in a pan you know how sticky it is and 
how difficult it is to clean mrs matthews said well that 
sticky product is the soluble fiber 
oat bran which is extracted from the oat seed is even more 
concentrated in fiber content 
when farms were powered mostly by horses and mules a record of 
25 million in the us inventory in the early 1920s farmers grew 
more than 40 million acres of oats each year 
as recently as 1954 oats were harvested from 406 million 
acres but by the mid1960s the crop was down to less than 20 
million acres and in the late 1970s dropped to below 10 million 
last years drought cut the harvest to 56 million acres this 
years harvest rose to more than 68 million acres primarily a 
result of improved weather in some key areas and relatively high 
market prices 
a major reason for the slide in oats production however has 
been the federal crop program that makes barley and other grains 
more profitable to produce 
oats are grown in most states but are concentrated in the north 
central region including the dakotas minnesota iowa and nebraska 
since 1982 according to usda economists linwood a hoffman and 
mark ash government programs have created a competitive 
disadvantage for oats by assigning a common acreage base to oats 
and barley 
under the price support apparatus farmers simply had a better 
financial deal with barley instead of oats 
finally hoffman and ash say in a recent analysis congress in 
1985 set up the conservation reserve program so that farmers could 
take erosionprone land from crop production for 10 years 
in many instances this land was planted to oats prior to 
entry into the program they said 
oats is not a kingpin crop in the united states when compared 
with some others in predrought 1987 for example the value of 
oats production ranked 16th among major us field crops at 606 
million by comparison corn was 14 billion soybeans 113 
billion hay 9 billion and wheat 55 billion 
despite the growth in supermarket products oats is still 
basically a livestock feed grain with only the higherquality 
portion going to food processors about 300 million bushels are 
expected to be used as feed in 198990 compared with around 110 
million bushels as food and seed 
pete riley of the usda economic research service said oats 
prices averaged about 152 a bushel in the first five months of 
the crops current marketing year which began june 1 
the average for the full 198889 marketing year was 261 a 
bushel up from 156 in 198788 reflecting the droughtyear 
market bulge 
congress is putting together new legislation to replace the 1985 
farm law that expires next year one of the items under review is 
the oats program and how more us production can be encouraged 
david l senter national director of the american agricultural 
movement said the best way to avoid importing more oats is just 
to improve the program so that farmers can economically afford to 
grow em again 
senter said that when the current farm law was designed in 1985 
there was virtually no concern about oats lawmakers he said 
got caught up in writing programs for other crops and oats 
production did not receive the attention it should have

henry roeland byrd had a right to sing the 
blues 
the thin old man with the shy grin and the dark glasses known 
as professor longhair or fess for short had plenty of hard 
times songs sold for grocery money music stolen royalties not 
paid gigs worked for peanuts 
he also had a way of pounding it out on a piano that started 
feet moving hearts thumping fingers tapping and a whole bunch of 
musicians searching for a new way of making music 
it was a swingstride piano said pianist george winston 
he did it like no one else he was influential on people who 
didnt even know he was influencing them he influenced fats 
domino allen toussaint dr john he influenced people who 
influenced people who influenced people 
almost a decade after professor longhairs death in 1980 
winstons dancing cat label has rereleased rock n roll gumbo 
a professor longhair album originally released in france 
house party new orleans style an lp recorded in 1971 and 
released in 1987 won a grammy that year 
i was on a plane from los angeles to orlando and they had this 
movie on called dead poets society and i couldnt believe it 
said dr john the performer generally credited with carrying on 
professor longhairs music to the greatest degree 
fess hey little girl was on the soundtrack i looked around 
the plane and there were people just grooving in their seats to the 
music and i said oh yeah how about this 
dr john and winston both performed regular benefits for 
professor longhairs widow before her death in october the 
benefits provided alice walton byrd with an income during the years 
after her husbands death 
they were a wonderful way to help her it was as if her 
husband was still taking care of her through his music and of 
course it was a great way to celebrate the man and his music for 
everyone involved said allison minor kaslow who managed the 
singer for the last years of his life and still administers 
professor longhair music publishing co 
the man has been dead for 10 years and its like hes still 
alive i hear his music more now than ever said connie atkinson 
editor of wavelength a new orleans music magazine 
she said his influence on rhythm and blues and rock which was 
limited to new orleans for years has been extended worldwide now 
with his albums in constant demand in europe 
i dont like the term cult because that has religious 
overtones but thats about what it is we call it the fess 
underground said kaslow 
in 1950 baldhead longhairs only recording to make the 
charts was released by mercury later that year he signed with 
atlantic and in 1953 recorded tipitina which years later 
became one of his most famous songs initially it had only local 
success and soon the song and the professor were both forgotten 
in 1971 quinten davis and kaslow were working on the second new 
orleans jazz and heritage festival davis who had some of 
professor longhairs old 45s and 78s had hooked kaslow on the 
music and they decided to try to get longhair to perform 
we heard he went into a record shop and quint would drop in 
there all the time and ask for fess one day he went in and there 
he was sweeping the floor kaslow said 
he had been supporting himself and his family at odd jobs and by 
gambling davis recalled and although he was physiclly in bad 
shape he had not lost anything as a performer 
when he went on stage at the jazz fest it was a real cliche 
he started playing and all the musicians on the other stages quit 
playing and came to hear him davis said 
he was an old man in bad shape when allison and quint found 
him atkinson remembered he couldnt walk couldnt breath 
well his teeth were gone but the longer he played the younger he 
got the last time i saw him shortly before he died in 1980 he 
ran over and jumped up on the stage 
professor longhair became a regular at the new orleans jazz 
fest and by the mid1970s played festivals in newport chicago and 
europe in 1976 he cut a new record live on the queen mary 
at a party for paul mccartney who was an admirer longhair and his 
band toured north america in 1979 
in new orleans tipitinas a small bar near the mississippi 
river became his regular home when he was not on the road the 
bar which featured live music nightly has retained its reputation 
for rhythm and blues and jazz performances a bust of the fess sits 
near the entrance and fans are trying to create a longhair park in 
the boulevard outside 
in a city known for its music where distinctive styles produce 
a sound unique to the region professor longhair was one of a kind 
he was influenced by the blues and cuban rumba music and new 
orleans street music but he went beyond all of those winston 
said 
hes been labeled blues but he never considered himself as 
playing one kind of music dr john said 
professor longhair who developed his sense of rhythm through 
tap dancing as a young man translated that to the piano with a 
boogiewoogie stride and a sizzling left hand then added calypso 
merengue and rhumba beats to oldtime new orleans rhythm and blues 
and rock n roll 
he came from bogalusa out in the country so he didnt grow 
up with the usual new orleans music background he didnt read 
music he listened to the spanish the brass bands the african 
the blues all of it and then put it together in his own way 
kaslow said 
he had a wild and untamed way of playing in the same way bach 
had inventions professor longhair had five or six inventions that 
changed the piano forever you could build a life on any of them 
said allen toussaint 
toussaint a prolific songwriter known for his funky piano and 
intricate arrangements credits the professor for much of his style 
ive loved him all my life and copied all of his recordings as 
much as i could his influence is enormous i hear it second 
third fourth hand on people who dont even know he influenced 
them he said 
the fess underground shows every sign of growing and of 
going above ground and dr john says theres a good reason the 
music will last 
it was very hip in the 40s and 50s and 60s when he was 
writing it and its very hip now it will be hip a long time

few stars remain from hollywoods golden age 
clark gable cary grant bette davis all long gone the survivors 
james stewart katharine hepburn myrna loy rarely make movies 
anymore 
but one popular collection of screen idols has endured looks 
undiminished by age mickey mouse donald duck goofy how old are 
they only their illustrators know for sure but theyve been 
around more than 50 years and should last at least 50 more 
their studio is intact as well hollywoods happiest endings 
still come from walt disney pictures nothing like a cartoon to 
stop time and even pull it back a little only at disney are glass 
slippers handsome princes and magic wands accepted without 
reservation 
the latest animated spectacular from the disney machine is the 
little mermaid a feature thats bound to generate more big bucks 
for the highly successful studio disneys last animated feature 
oliver and company has grossed about 50 million a rerelease 
this year of peter pan has pulled in 30 million although 
disney officials wouldnt disclose how much the little mermaid 
cost to make those in the industry put it between 10 million and 
15 million 
cynics better stay away from the little mermaid theyll 
never believe this one something about a beautiful blueeyed 
mermaid falling in love with a handsome prince and goodness 
defeating the evil sea witch 
of course cynics wouldnt have sat through snow white and the 
seven dwarfs cinderella or bambi either and as disney 
chairman jeffrey katzenberg explained the little mermaid takes 
a lot of its glitter from those golden oldies 
i wanted us to make a film that had the look and feel and the 
entertainment and lushness of pinocchio he said in a recent 
interview 
if you talk with writers directors animators designers 
effects people layout artists across the board in this movie 
all the refreneces that i made the goals i kept setting for them 
were cant we do something that is like pinocchio 
the little mermaid is rated naturally g for general 
audiences thats how katzenberg sees it say the film is for 
children and hell grimace his eyes widening the jaw stretching 
family entertainment means the entire family he insists 
theyre fantastic stories theyre not childrens stories 
theyre great stories and theyre made for the kid inside everyone 
of us as opposed to made for children theres a real distinction 
there 
we try to make it very intelligent very smart very 
sophisticated there is very little about the film that is 
cartoonish even when its animal characters that are speaking 
youll notice its very sophisticated 
ask about romance action drama and katzenberg will talk 
strategy borrowing a page from film mogul samuel goldwyn who 
insisted the world needed laughter when his competitors were 
serious and lamented the disappearance of messages when others 
turned out comedies 
but animation belongs to disney who would want to compete with 
the ugly ducking peter pan fantasia and dozens of 
others 
its a tradition katzenberg wouldnt dream of touching although 
a little retouching doesnt hurt for the little mermaid based 
on the hans christian andersen story that means the richest 
colors the brightest melodies courtesy of little shop of 
horrors composer alan menken and the most vivid illustrations 
often resembling the performers buddy hackett and pat carroll 
among them who provide the voices 
nothing is left to chance everyone has to rehearse even 
mermaids 
theres not a sequence in the film in which there are human 
characters not staged and shot on film and used as references in 
order to make sure that the human characters moved very much like 
people move 
we built an eightfoot tank put a lady in it and had her swim 
around a lot to get the sense of movement and hair how it moves 
through the water and the sense of weightlessness 
the little mermaid is just the beginning katzenberg talks 
of a renaissance for disney animation so get ready to see 
those ageless stars dusted off again when the studio needed a lead 
for its version of the prince and the pauper to be released 
late in 1990 mickey mouse got the call minnie mouse goofy 
donald duck and pluto will costar 
also in the works are beauty and the beast an arabian 
night the story of aladdin and his magic lamp swan lake 
and king of the jungle 
and why bother with surveying the public numbers boxoffice 
numbers speak louder than words 
seeing is makebelieving has always been disneys unofficial 
motto 
i want people going out of this movie saying god i havent 
been affected like this i havent seen anything like this for 
years music that much fun and that much part of the movie 
katzenberg said 
its a musical its a love story its emotional you feel 
very sad for this girl who loses everything happy for her at the 
end what youre hoping to do is get a reaction each movie looks 
for something different some make you laugh some make you cry 
each one is a different thrill

federal reserve board governor wayne d angell 
says the central bank needs to reduce inflation to about 3 percent 
in 1990 and he expects to meet that goal in the first half of the 
year 
inflation has been falling since the fed began tightening credit 
in 1988 to slow the economy the fed began easing credit in may and 
nudged shortterm interest rates lower earlier this week 
but angells comments made to reporters after a speech thursday 
to the american institute of certified public accountants appeared 
to indicate the fed might not be prepared to cut interest rates 
further in the immediate future 
angell told the accountants he supports a pending house bill 
that would mandate that the central bank eliminate inflation by 
1994 fed chairman allan greenspan endorsed the proposal last month 
in an appearance before the house banking monetary policy 
subcommittee 
inflation as measured by the consumer price index had dropped to 
an annual rate of 43 percent by september a level angell told 
reporters still was too high 
the bill calling for zero inflation was introduced by the 
monetary policy subcommittee chairman rep neal l smith dnc 
it does not include any penalty for failing to reach that level 
it was supported at a subcommittee hearing thursday by former 
fed gov lyle e gramley who called it a desirable statement 
of priorities for monetary policy he added i would not hold out 
hope that its passage would greatly simplify the achievement of a 
noninflationary economy 
the subcommittee also is considering a bill introduced by reps 
lee hamilton dind and byron dorgan dnd designed to reduce 
the independence of the fed 
that bill would require the feds policysetting open market 
committeeto meet three times a year with the treasury secretary and 
the presidents budget director and chief economic adviser allow 
the president to appoint the fed chairman a year after taking 
office immediately disclose any changes in monetary policy 
targets permit government accounting office audits of fed 
operations and require publication of the fed budget 
the hamiltondorgan bill has been criticized as politicizing 
the central bank but hamilton described it at thursdays hearing as 
a responsible way to make the independent fed accountable to 
the public 
gramley however said he generally opposes the hamiltondorgan 
bill because the federal reserves independence from the 
administrative branch needs to be preserved 
james tobin a nobel laureate and economics professor at yale 
university endorsed several of the hamiltondorgan proposals 
including presidential appointment of the fed chairman a year after 
taking office tobin said he would expand administration 
participation in fed policymaking to all meetings of the open 
market committee 
but he rejected mandating immediate announcement of policy 
decisions and said terms of the central bank governors should be 
reduced from 14 years to 10 and board membership cut from seven to 
five 
tobin also recommended that the president name the heads of the 
district fed banks subject to senate confirmation the district 
presidents now are selected by the directors of the member banks 
subject to approval by the fed governors and alternate as members 
of the open market committee

the bush administration has rejected as too 
costly proposals to boost government price supports for barley and 
oats which have been in declining production despite increased 
consumer demand 
health concerns have triggered consumer demand for cereal 
grains particulary for oat products including oatmeal bran and 
flour 
as a result of smaller harvests in recent years the united 
states has had to import oats from canada and other foreign 
suppliers to meet demand 
bills congress is considering would cost the government 130 
million in higher payments for barley and an additional 
unspecified amount for oats said keith bjerke administrator of 
the agricultural stabilization and conservation service 
selected increases in target prices for barley and oats could 
lead to detrimental effects for producers and consumers of other 
program crops and lead to expanded federal outlays bjerke told a 
house agriculture subcommittee 
target prices are goals set in the governments crop programs to 
help determine direct subsidies to farmers when market prices are 
down 
bjerke said thursday the agriculture department is taking some 
steps to stimulate oats production which has not kept pace with 
the demand generated by the grains reported health benefits 
forcing the united states to import nearly 30 percent of its 
production 
congress should wait to change target prices until it rewrites 
the governments multiyear farm program next year bjerke said 
producers claim subsidies for barley and oats are relatively low 
in comparison to price supports for wheat corn and sorghum the 
cost of producing barley and oats actually exceeds the price 
farmers can get one economist testified 
farmers have had strong incentives to produce crops that have 
high target prices relative to costs said martin abel who 
represented the national association of barley growers 
conversely they have had much less incentive to produce crops 
with low target prices relative to costs namely barley and oats 
the subsidy for barley is too low because the agriculture 
department calculates it by combining the market prices for malting 
barley and feed barley which brings up to 50 cents less per 
bushel producers say 
lagging oats production is blamed both on low target prices and 
planting restrictions in the farm program that discourage farmers 
from switching to oats from other crops 
in addition the conservation reserve program which pays 
farmers not to plant crops on highly erodible land has taken a 
disproportionate amount of oats acerage out of production said 
john bollingberg a bremen nd farmer representing the american 
oat association 
the us imported 60 million bushels of oats or 28 percent of 
its production last year during the drought he said in testimony 
prepared for the committee while us oat production is expected 
to rebound slightly this year imports are still expected to reach 
40 million bushels he said 
the government does not expect to make any deficiency payments 
for oats next year because market prices are expected to be higher 
than the 145 target price bjerke said

connected with blue arrow plcs takeover of usbased manpower 
inc two years ago 
the british employmentservice companys takeover of the much 
larger manpower which has its headquarters in milwaukee wis 
created the worlds largest temporary employment company 
the charges apparently are related to the investment firm county 
natwests failure to properly disclose a 134 percent blue arrow 
holding it was left with after a sale of blue arrow shares flopped 
county natwest helped arrange the sale of blue arrow shares to 
existing blue arrow shareholders to finance the takeover of 
manpower 
the 10 defendants were charged with conspiracy to defraud and 
were to appear before city of london magistrates court today 
police said an unspecified number of them were arrested thursday 
and later released 
the city of london is the citys financial district 
the investment firms natwest investment bank ltd county 
natwest ltd and ubs phillips and drew securities ltd also were 
charged with conspiracy to defraud as well as with conspiracy to 
contravene section 13 of the prevention of fraud investments act 
1958 police said 
county natwest and ubs phillips and drew officials declined 
comment 
the police and the serious fraud squad a central governmental 
unit charged with investigating financial crime have been 
conducting an investigation into the case which is known as the 
blue arrow affair 
the investigation began after the department of trade and 
industry released a report in july on events related to the sale of 
blue arrow shares 
the report severely criticized national westminster plc its 
county natwest unit and union bank of switzerlands ubs phillips 
and drew for their conduct 
when the 13 billion sale of blue arrow shares failed county 
natwest didnt disclose its 134percent stake in blue arrow for

investment company executives agree that 
computerdriven program trading helps fuel wild swings in the stock 
market but theyre split on what congress should do about it 
former treasury secretary donald regan told a house panel 
thursday that a bill to limit computerdriven stock trading doesnt 
go far enough and suggested a ban on one form of the market 
strategy 
he targeted index arbitrage in which speculators try to take 
advantage of inconsistencies between the stock and futures markets 
by simultaneously buying in one while selling in the other 
critics claim index arbitrage widens stock price swings and 
drives small investors out of the market 
there is no good index arbitrage effect upon the market the 
volatility up is just as bad as the volatility down said michael 
roth an executive vice president with usaa investment management 
company of san antonio texas 
rep edward j markey dmass chairman of the 
telecommunications and finance subcommittee plans to introduce 
legislation to restrict program trading during times of extreme 
market turbulence 
but regan the former head of merrill lynch amp co said this 
is more of a partial solution to the problem and if enacted may 
not cure it 
he said the problem was stock index futures futures contracts 
tied to the performance of large groups of stocks which have 
commoditized our stock market 
regan suggested doing away with the commodity aspects of index 
futures in order to lessen volatility or we should make the 
stock market derivatives have the same rules as stocks 
the panel members agreed that market volatility scares investors 
out of the market and that makes it harder for us companies to 
raise capital through the sale of stock 
and if you do that said lawrence zicklin managing partner of 
the new york invesment firm neuberger amp berman you reduce their 
ability to compete with foreign corporations 
most of wall streets large investment houses recently have 
revised their policies on index arbitrage 
and the new york stock exchange has called on large 
institutional investors to curb program trading while ways to 
handle the bursts of stock orders it generates are considered 
but money managers who oversee pension funds and other 
institutional investors who do not belong to the nyse said they 
would continue to use index arbitrage 
markeys plan would grant emergency powers to the securities and 
exchange commission to temporarily halt program trading during 
extreme market turbulence 
markey is seeking to amend the stock market reform act of 1989 
which is pending before the subcommittee 
that bill calls for giving the sec authority to halt trading in 
market emergencies requiring reports of large securities and 
options trades and rules for assessing the financial stability of 
the parent companies of brokerdealers 
markey said the subcommittee would vote tuesday on passing the 
bill along to the full house energy and commerce committee 
a similar bill that has no program trading ban is pending in the 
senate 
but philip j purcell chairman of dean witter financial 
services inc said the real problem is volatility not program 
trading 
although his firm has halted index arbitrage for customer 
accounts purcell said the public should recognize that any 
steps taken to curb program trading will not cure volatility

the new york stock exchange has begun major 
investigations into potential violations involving computerized 
stock trading strategies exchange president john j phelan jr 
announced 
phelan said thursday the probe involves trading in both the new 
york securities and chicago futures exchanges and focuses on an 
illegal financial market strategy called frontrunning 
after a speech to corporate investor relations officials phelan 
also said he was not concerned about reports that large 
institutions have not scaled back their program trading despite a 
big board request for voluntary restraint 
the exchange thursday also defended its method for measuring the 
amount of monthly program trading after business week magazine 
asserted the big board calculation erroneously doubles the figure 
the nyse last month instituted a series of reforms amid a 
growing outrcy by some securities firms and lawmakers that a 
computerized trading strategy known as index arbitrage had made the 
market more volatile 
phelan said the nyse and other regulators were examining the 
possibility of frontrunning or other manipulative tactics in 
the program trading strategy known as index arbitrage 
in frontrunning a broker buys or sells stocks or futures for 
its own account ahead of a customers order using the knowledge 
that the customer order is likely to affect prices in the market 
exchange officials confirmed that the study includes the chicago 
mercantile exchange and chicago board of trade officials are 
looking at sharp price swings in the market last july that may be 
related to program trading 
theres a lot of concern that the type of trading actually 
going on creates a lot of opportunity for abuse nyse spokeswoman 
sharon gamsin said we have not necessarily identified specific 
situations we are looking at 
the big board defines program trading as any order for the 
simultaneous purchase or sale of 15 or more stocks valued at more 
than 1 million index arbitrage involves rapid trading of stocks 
and stockindex futures traded in chicago to profit from momentary 
price discrepancies between the two 
index arbitrage defenders say the strategy helps stabilize 
trading by linking the two markets pulling prices closer together 
morris markovitz an stockindex futures trader at the 
commodities firm mercury management associates inc said possible 
program trading manipulation should not be used as another excuse 
to criticize the strategy 
when you put poison in a cup of cocoa you dont ban the cocoa 
you ban the poison he said 
business week contends in its nov 20 issue released thursday 
to the media that the nyses method of calculating program trading 
volume exaggerates the total the big board divides program stock 
sales and purchases by total volume whereas trading by specialists 
is divided by twice the total volume 
nyse spokesman richard torrenzano said the calculation accounts 
for differences in the two types of trading he said the exchange 
has made public its methodology monthly since it began calculating 
program trading volume in july 1988 
the numbers we have published for the last 18 months are 
correct torrenzano said it appears business week doesnt like 
the methodolgy we use that doesnt make the numbers wrong 
among its reforms the nyse requested that its member firms ask 
customers to refrain from all types of program trading unless it 
would have a stabilizing influence in the market installed 
slowdowns when the market declines rapidly and limited access of 
program trades to the nyses computerized order system 
but market players said that large institutions show no signs of 
abating their program trading stockindex funds such as wells 
fargo investment advisers bankers trust co and mellon capital 
management are among the largest stockindex arbitrage clients on 
wall street 
phelan said he is not yet concerned because the voluntary 
pullbacks were designed for periods of volatility 
were just trying to get in in phelan said after a speech 
to the national investor relations institute we havent hit 
those periods of market illiquidity we talked about 
the impact of the battle over program trading should become 
noticeable within two weeks when the nyse issues its first weekly 
report on total program trading activity until now the exchange 
issued monthly figures 
debate over program trading intensified after the oct 13 
190point market drop and a rapid 80point rise on oct 24 major 
wall street brokerages dropped index arbitrage and investors and 
corporations lashed out at the strategy as scaring away individual 
investors 
phelan said he supports legislation to help control volatility 
but slowing the market down is preferable to banning program 
trading which only congress could do 
there are millions of gallons of alcoholic beverages produced 
in this country that doesnt mean you have to be sloshed every 
day he said

philippines president corazon aquino isnt 
exactly hawking jc penney co wares today but the nations 
fourthlargest retailer is enjoying the attention brought by her 
interest in its festival of the philippines promotion 
mrs aquino is scheduled for an afternoon tour of an exhibit 
hall featuring some of the 110 million worth of filipino products 
penney will market during the promotion next may 
since learning of the texasbased retailers plans she has been 
anxious to be involved in the campaign said w barger tygart 
penneys director of merchandising 
penney has invited about 2000 people to the reception at a posh 
dallas hotel joining penney chairman william g howell as hosts 
will be multimillionaire developer trammell crow and texas gov 
bill clements 
on saturday mrs aquino who is in the united states on a 
political visit will tour a penney store in an upscale north 
dallas mall it anchors along with such stores as neimanmarcus and 
lord amp taylor 
the festival of the philippines is the latest international 
promotion for penney such events are becoming annual affairs for 
the company with previous promotions centering on great britain 
india and italy 
the filipino promotion also reflects the new emphasis at penney 
apparel and soft home furnishings 
in 1983 penney began eliminating automotive electronics and 
hard goods from its stores a decision that cost 15 billion in 
revenue howell said but put the company more in sync with what 
american consumers expect at jc penneys 
jc penney is truly positioned as the middle income 
department store of the country said thomas tashjian a retail 
analyst at seidler amdec securities inc in los angeles 
the company is the largest occupant of mall space in the 
country and what it has done is it has adjusted its merchandising 
strategy to serve that mall customer who is mainly female and 
mainly looking for clothes tashjian said 
although founder james cash penneys original golden rule stores 
focused on soft goods they had taken a detour for a time into 
hard goods when they saw sears being very successful in hard 
goods tashjian said 
apparel now accounts for 82 percent of penney sales with 
womens apparel at 42 percent of total sales in 1981 apparel was 
63 percent with womens at 30 percent home and leisure goods have 
fallen from 37 percent in 1981 to 18 percent last year 
howell has predicted that by 1993 overall apparel sales will 
make up 72 percent of total sales 
despite an industrywide slump in apparel sales penney sales so 
far this year have rebounded to 1013 billion through oct 28 an 
82 percent increase from the same time last year 
with the busy holiday season upcoming the company already has 
reached 68 percent of last years retail sales and 66 percent of 
its record 1987 sales 
and when thirdquarter earnings are released tuesday i dont 
think were going to disappoint anybody howell said in an 
interview this week at the companys temporary headquarters in 
addison a corporate suburb on dallass northern border to which it 
moved from new york last year before it settles in nearby plano 
analysts are looking for earnings of 140 to 150 per share 
compared with last years 116 
theyre doing very well said jeffrey edelman a retail 
analyst at drexel burnham lambert inc in new york last year 
they were cleaning out the store of merchandise they didnt want 
and this year theyre filling it up with merchandise they want 
led by howell analysts said penneys management has become 
aggressive and pays more attention to market research than some of 
its competitors howell frequently recites those findings in 
explaining his companys operations 
were going to change because the american consumer is going 
to change he said but he believes penney already is ahead of 
its competition in the race for future sales 
we have faith that we have a competitive advantage that jc 
penney will be one of the survivors with a triple threat of 
retail catalog and television howell said 
while about 80 percent of penneys sales come from instore 
purchases its shop television network on cable tv presents 
wellknown celebrities hawking jc penney products its 
shopbymail catalog provides the rest of its sales

the nations first luxury passenger train in 
decades rolled into town three minutes late but its owner said the 
enterprise wouldnt leave him a dollar short 
this is kind of like the country club without the golf 
course said william spann if this doesnt work the message 
will be loud and clear americans dont care how they travel i bet 
a considerable sum of money they do 
the americaneuropean express completed its 17hour inaugural 
run to chicago from washington dc on thursday 
the fur and silkclad guests rode in grand style by invitation 
but regular passengers will pay a grand and more for the privilege 
of sinking into overstuffed chairs in the lush club car and tucking 
in sevencourse meals served from plates that ring when flicked 
with a manicured fingernail 
kevin keefe associate editor of trains magazine and an expert 
on passengertrain travel said the americaneuropean express may 
prove to be a financial success 
its an exciting prospect for people traveling by train in 
the grand manner he said in an interview from milwaukee it 
harkens back to a time when traveling on a longdistance train 
was an experience to be savored 
he added its much fancier than what you get on amtrak 
a jazz band blared chattanooga choochoo as the guests 
disembarked at union station 
most seemed suitably impressed 
instead of the hurryitis we usually have i feel like ive 
been on a little vacation said north carolinian bonnie 
mcelveenhunter as she clutched her fulllength fur to shield her 
from a chilling chicago wind its a return to yesteryear we 
need that 
this was the perfect opportunity to do something different 
said washington attorney patrick keeley 
it was a european travel experience said his wife regina 
who nonetheless acknowledged putting on mascara was kind of 
difficult 
americaneuropean express will run two fivecar trains between 
chicago and washington one going each way six days a week the 
first regular run will be wednesday 
most of its rail cars were built in the 1940s and 50s many by 
the pullman co the interior decorating is anything but plebeian 
pianist bill andrew will play requests on the grand piano in the 
art decoinspired club car where the brass window trim is 
complemented by faux tortoise leather wainscoting dinner is 
served on fine china with damask table linens 
as could be expected luxury travel doesnt come cheap a 
doubleoccupancy fare runs about 1042 while booking the trains 
presidential cabin will cost 1450 
the fancy trains will be pulled behind amtrak trains for a 
fancy fee an example of amtraks creativity in raising money 
keefe said 
spann said americaneuropean express invested about 1 million 
per car in refurbishing but expects to turn a profit 
we have 26 rooms with an average price of 1000 he said 
on an average night what you really want to achieve is somewhere 
between 18000 and 24000 in sales if you do that you can pay 
for this investment 
spann said there are still a few wrinkles to iron out 
theres no kleenex in the rooms he reflected you spend 
millions of dollars and forget the kleenex

the hightechnology industry is taking another hit 
with the announcement by wang laboratories inc that it will cut 
2000 jobs in an effort to restore profitability 
president richard miller announced the move thursday saying the 
computer industry has lost its boom forcing the company to undergo 
a fundamental reordering and pay more attention to its 
customers 
but analysts who welcomed the change said wang has contributed 
to many of its problems and that bolder steps are necessary to make 
the company more competitive 
this is a necessary but not a sufficient step said barry 
willman an analyst with sanford c bernstein amp co inc 
the cutback was the latest sign of a hightech industry slowdown 
that has contributed to a softening of the economy 
some fundamental things are happening that will drive all 
computer companies to do things differently or they will fail 
miller said 
prior to thursdays announcement the company already had cut 
about 5000 jobs this year and announced plans to sell 200 million 
in assets wang posted a loss of 621 million in the first quarter 
that ended sept 30 and miller predicted more losses for the 
second quarter 
miller was appointed president of wang in august succeeding 
frederick wang who had been ousted from the job by an wang his 
father company founder and chairman 
miller said under the companys new approach wang will cut its 
bureaucracy to get in closer touch with the needs of its customers 
we are eliminating the layers between the field and 
laboratory he said we will eliminate entire functions 
functions that i view as stifling 
for example he said the companys product development programs 
often duplicate efforts with no single group taking 
responsibility as a result products often have been introduced 
late 
the reorganization of the company will mean the loss of about 
2000 jobs by jan 1 lowering the wang workforce to just over 
22000 he said 
about 1000 of the layoffs will occur in massachusetts mostly 
at the companys headquarters in lowell with the rest scattered 
around the world 
a severance package for these employees will result in a 
onetime charge of 30 million in the companys second quarter 
which ends dec 31 
miller said the restructuring announced thursday would cut 
annual costs by about 115 million but he stressed that the 
company was not simply calculating how much needed to be cut in 
order to be profitable 
the hightech industry recently has suffered other setbacks 
data general corp announced last month it would eliminate 2200 
jobs and digital equipment corp recently offered voluntary 
severance to 700 workers 
i think restructuring is becoming a common word in this 
industry miller said 
miller said much of wangs bureaucracy grew while the hightech 
industry was booming but now the industry has reached a 
maturing stage with slower growth he said 
the bureaucracy just built up because of the luxury of very 
big margins in a high growth industry he said 
but while miller pointed to the fluctuations in the computer 
industry for many of his companys problems analysts said some of 
the trouble particularly poor customer service has been unique 
to wang 
they have had this problem with service and support for a long 
time said steven wendler an analyst with gartner group inc 
rick miller is a breath of fresh air 
also wendler said after the company completes the costcutting 
measures the hemorrhaging financially will stop 
george elling an analyst with merrill lynch amp co said during 
the 1970s and early 1980s wang did not pay attention to customer 
service because it became confident as a leader in word processing 
equipment 
they had something everyone wanted he said people were 
willing to put up with poorer service 
wang was too slow to recognize they needed to change he 
said noting that other companies have adapted better to new 
product demands 
part of the change miller said will include more focus on 
software and other computer applications 
most customers are not crying for new technology he said 
they are crying for new applications of technology

a fiveyear plan for campbell soup co calls for 
aggressive moves to grab more of the convenience food market and 
the possible sale of some food subsidiaries the companys interim 
management team says 
business is an evolving thing said edwin harper who serves 
with herbert baum as executive vice president there are some 
assets we dont really need 
campbell owns pepperidge farm vlasic foods mrs pauls 
kitchens godiva chocolatier and casera foods 
some businesses in my opinion are near the borderline baum 
added during a news conference here thursday the two officials 
first since being named to oversee campbells daytoday operations 
nov 1 
conveniencefood marketing and plantmodernization will require 
a 2 billion investment over the next five years they said 
baum and harper took over temporarily for r gordon mcgovern 
the companys president and chief executive who stepped down after 
nine years campbells board had been unhappy with the companys 
performance in recent years and there had been rumors that it 
might be sold 
both baum and harper are candidates to succeed mcgovern baum 
said board chairman robert j vlasic has indicated the selection 
process would be completed by early next year 
in september campbell reported fiscal 1989 earnings of 13 
million on sales of 572 billion compared to earnings of 274 
million on sales of 487 billion the previous year the company 
attributed the earnings decline to a 343 million charge related to 
a corporate restructuring that involved the closing of 
manufacturing plants in new jersey maryland and tennessee 
eliminating 2800 jobs 
harper called the restructuring a pretty thorough 
housecleaning but both he and baum indicated further cuts may be 
needed 
campbell based in camden nj is the nations largest 
soupmaker it sells about 5 billion cans a year which represents 
about 65 percent of the 22 billion retail soup market 
harper who was promoted from executive vice president and chief 
financial officer is overseeing campbells foreign operations he 
said the company is developing a strategy for modernization of its 
facilities worldwide

the federal aviation administration has directed 
airlines to expand inspections for possible cracks on all models of 
boeing 747 airliners with 15500 or more flights 
the faa said in an emergency airworthiness directive that an 
airline conducting a more limited inspection ordered last week 
found multiple longitudinal skin cracks outside the specified 
area 
this new information indicates that the inspection 
requirements of the previous directive must be extended to detect 
all cracks such cracking if not detected could result in rapid 
decompression of the airplane said the directive issued by the 
faas northwest mountain region office in seattle on thursday 
the new inspection by visual and electronic methods includes 
all of the nose section back to the passenger door said elizabeth 
reese spokeswoman for boeing 
the directive also expands the number of planes that must be 
inspected to include 123 planes worldwide and 59 in the united 
states the planes are from among the first 430 747s to roll off 
boeings everett production line starting in 1968 
some 300 more 747s eventually will have to be inspected once 
they reach the 15500flight milestone or roughly threefourths of 
the planes design life 
the original directive issued nov 2 ordered airlines to 
inspect only an area of the upper part of the cockpit for minute 
cracks and applied to the 92 oldest boeing 747s 
the first directive also had excluded planes that had been 
modified to help prevent cracking but faa spokesman dave duff said 
cracks between 01 and 025 inches in length were found in at least 
one 747 that had been modified 
the modifications were begun in 1986 under boeings aging 
aircraft program and included the replacement of the old aluminum 
skin with a new aluminum alloy and reinforcement of the area 
were concerned about any cracking and if additional cracking 
is found well expand the number of planes were looking at duff 
said 
the inspections are to be made within 30 days with any repairs 
to be made before further flight is allowed 
the order means that any 747s already inspected following the 
nov 2 directive will have to be reinspected 
both directives were prompted by the discovery of 28 cracks 
found on sept 27 in the front section of a 747400 cargo freighter 
owned by federal express

a federal judge has approved a 235 
million settlement for 117 female flight attendants who sued pan 
american world airways for using stricter weight standards for them 
than for men 
us district judge thelton henderson said thursday that the 
settlement was fundamentally fair and highly favorable to the 
attendants despite objections from six women whose damage claims 
were fully or partially denied 
the settlement will be shared by 117 women who were suspended 
fired or denied promotions because of the weight policy said 
kathleen king an attorney for the independent union of flight 
attendants 
pan am also agreed to liberalize weight standards for current or 
future employees 
the former policy used a 1959 insurance company table of heights 
and weights but judged men under the standard for large frames and 
women under the standard for medium frames a 5foot7 woman was 
allowed to weigh 139 pounds under the medium standard but would 
have been allowed to weigh 150 under the large standard 
the flight attendants union sued pan am in 1984 and won a 
ruling from henderson three years later in a nonjury trial that 
the policy was biased 
the ruling was the first to find discrimination by an airline 
that had weight policies for both men and women pan am attorney 
richard schoolman said at the time 
henderson ordered the airline to use a largeframe standard for 
all employees hired while the policy was in effect through the end 
of 1984 
pan am appealed hendersons ruling denying it had 
discriminated the appeal is being dropped as part of the 
settlement without any admission of discrimination 
the settlement retains hendersons previous order on weight 
standards and also increases some of the standards adopted by the 
airline in 1985 when it started setting weight requirements 
according to an employees individual build in addition women 
hired after 1985 get another threepound allowance at ages 35 45 
and 55 
although 25 million was less than the women might have gotten 
in individual damage claims henderson said it was reasonable in 
light of the time an appeal would have taken and the risk that the 
entire amount would have been thrown out on appeal

talks are underway between the city and chemical 
banking corp to try to persuade the company not to move 3000 jobs 
to new jersey 
i think weve made perfectly clear that chemical is a very 
important corporation here in the city of new york and that we will 
make available our entire array of people and resources to keep 
them in new york said stanley e grayson the deputy mayor for 
finance and economic development 
he said thursday that discussions began anew after chemical 
pulled out of the multibilliondollar times square redevelopment 
project last spring 
the banks lease at its park avenue headquarters and offices in 
rockefeller center expire in 1994 chemical officials have been 
studying various options for 18 months including a new building in 
nearby secaucus nj said charles salmans a bank spokesman 
for some of our staff we have examined new jersey sites as 
well as new york sites he said 
the city has battled recently to keep companies such as chase 
manhattan corp and nbc in the city earlier this year merrill 
lynch announced it would move 2500 backoffice employees to jersey 
city nj and exxon corp said it would move 300 employees from 
its new york headquarters to dallas 
in an oct 25 letter to city officials chemical senior vice 
president peter brooke said the bank has enjoyed belowmarket 
rents but would face an extraordinary increase in expenses if 
it wanted to renew 
consequently a plan has been developed which retains a small 
flagship headquarters facility in manhattan containing staff who 
have an absolute need to be located there the letter said all 
other staff would be located in a second facility in new jersey 
salmans said the letter was written in response to a request 
from city officials for a listing of all of the areas of the bank 
that might potentially be relocated to new jersey 
the list adds up to about 3000 of the 4700 employees at the 
two sites salmans said 
no decisions have been taken but we did reach a point where 
we needed to get an understanding from officials of the city of new 
york for what incentives might be available to us to factor into 
how we looked at the cost of various alternatives salmans said 
grayson said chemical officials have indicated a willingness to 
move operations to a borough outside manhattan 
the bank also has discussed a nonbinding option with hartz 
mountain industries to construct in secaucus a building of a 
million square feet or more salmans said 
the state and city put together a 235 million package last year 
to keep chase from moving 5000 jobs to new jersey 
asked if chemical might expect a similar deal grayson said i 
dont believe that is a responsible way for us to act where the 
last deal becomes a starting point for the next deal with 
discussion with firms i think they very much understand that 
he said the final package would depend on the site chosen and 
whats in the best interest of the city

phoenix financier charles h keating jrs 
claim that federal regulators wrongfully seized the lincoln savings 
and loan association apparently will get a full hearing in court 
us district judge stanley sporkin on thursday ordered the 
first of a series of hearings dec 78 on keatings lawsuit 
challenge of the federal takeover in april of the insolvent sampl 
the takeover is estimated to cost the taxpayers 2 billion 
sporkin the former enforcement chief of the securities and 
exchange commission said keating and government witnesses are 
likely to be summoned to the hearing he said the session will 
enable him to test a few things on whether the case merits a 
full trial which could take two years or longer 
sporkin had said wednesday that i need a chance to figure 
things out mr keatings going to take the stand youre 
entitled to a day in court 
government attorneys had initially opposed sporkins suggestion 
that keating be heard in court asking instead that the judge 
dismiss the lawsuit on the basis of the administrative record used 
by the federal home loan bank board in deciding to seize lincoln 
under the arrangement ordered by sporkin testimony will be 
taken on only a small sample of the real estate transactions 
reflected by that 4000page record 
james murphy an attorney for the office of thrift supervision 
confirmed the government will call mr keating and one or more of 
our bank examiners 
keating is chairman of the american continental corp which was 
lincolns parent company the government argues american 
continental looted 94 million from lincolns depositors with bogus 
land investments murphy called it one of the worst of the 
worst cases of fraud and abuse in the nations sampl history 
there have been estimates that the federal bailout of the thrift 
industry may cost more than 150 billion

international business machines corp is 
expected to announce on tuesday a new generation of datastorage 
devices that have been delayed for months by expensive technical 
problems 
the disk drives for mainframe computers account for about 
onetenth of ibms 60 billion in annual revenue the delay in the 
new models past the original july announcement date was blamed for 
contributing to ibms 30 percent drop in thirdquarter profits 
stephen cohen an analyst at soundview financial group in 
stamford conn said he understood from talking to ibm customers 
that ibm has not entirely solved the technical problem so 
largescale shipments probably wont begin until the second quarter 
of 1990 
the problem apparently comes from inconsistent quality in a part 
from an outside supplier cohen said today 
ibm spokesman amos kerisch confirmed today that ibm was holding

if corporate profits keep lagging the way they 
have in the last few months many wall street analysts say they 
will soon slow the rapid growth of dividends 
spurred on by the earnings boom of 1988 and early 1989 dividend 
payments by the 500 companies in standard amp poors 500stock 
composite index are expected to show an increase of 13 percent this 
year 
that would rank as by far the strongest showing of this decade 
just about tripling the current rate of inflation 
but in 1990 sampp analysts project that the rate of dividend 
increases will drop back to the 5 percent to 6 percent range 
dividend hikes a strongly supportive market influence this 
year will be less of a factor next year sampp said in its weekly 
publication the outlook 
for much of the 1980s dividends have been consigned to a 
supporting role in the story of the markets ups and downs capital 
gains have been the dominant theme in a bull market where prices of 
many stocks chalked up gains of 200 percent 300 percent or more 
companies that found themselves with buildups of cash they could 
have devoted to dividend increases often opted for a different 
course using the money to buy back chunks of their stock 
but the crash of 1987 and this years october massacre have 
apparently helped inspire a revival of enthusiasm for dividends as 
a sort of stabilizing influence in periods of uncertainty 
in the weeks immediately following the 190point of the dow 
jones industrial average on oct 13 of this year dividendpaying 
stocks outperformed those without dividends by close to 2 to 1 
according to joseph barthel analyst at hopper soliday amp co 
dividends have always mattered to longterm investors hoping to 
benefit from rising income and hence inflation protection on 
their investment or from participation in dividend reinvestment 
plans for growth 
furthermore dividends have gained a new status in the last 
couple of years since tax reform did away with special breaks for 
longterm capital gains leaving both types of income subject to 
the same tax rates 
the trend in dividends of course is always heavily dependent 
on which way corporate profits are headed 
lately many wall street estimates of 1990 earnings have been 
cut back after a disappointing crop of reports for this years 
third quarter and early indications that the fourth quarter will 
also be weak 
but analysts opinions remain sharply divided over how long and 
how severe the earnings slump will be 
michael sherman investment strategist at shearson lehman hutton 
inc contends that it probably will have run its course by the 
middle of next year 
we still expect profits to resume an upward path in the second 
half of 1990 as inflation continues to subside shortterm interest 
rates decline and money supply growth which has returned to an 
expansionary level makes itself felt in aggregate demand 
sherman says 
on that score analysts say lower interest rates would be 
helpful for the market outlook in a couple of important ways 
first of all they would stand to bolster prospects for earnings 
and dividends by stimulating business activity secondly they 
would make dividend yields of stocks more attractive by comparison 
with returns available on interestbearing investments

though news stories on the delay in raising the 
federal debt limit last week had an apocalyptic tone the 
congressional procrastination caused little trouble in the bond 
market and no longterm damage experts say 
i think its overblown said david hale chief economist for 
kemper financial services inc 
the delay in hiking the ceiling on the amount of money the 
treasury may raise meant investors couldnt buy us savings bonds 
for a week it also meant state and local governments couldnt buy 
the special treasury securities they use to stash away proceeds 
from bond sales 
in addition the debtceiling problem posed the threat of 
depressing the bond market since it compressed the sale of 30 
billion in treasury notes and bonds into a shorterthanusual time 
frame 
without the usual time period for whenissued trading in the 
securities the trading of securities that goes on before they are 
actually issued some experts said the new treasury issues might 
have had to offer higher yields to attract enough buyers when bond 
yields rise their prices fall 
but a countervailing force on bond prices was a move by the 
federal reserve board last week to ease interest rates analysts 
said 
an auction of 10 billion in threeyear notes thursday seemed to 
disprove the experts with the notes selling at an average yield of 
777 percent the lowest for threeyear notes since feb 2 1988 
the treasury scheduled an auction of 10 billion in 10year 
notes for monday and 10 billion in 30year bonds for tuesday 
the impact on the bond market from the delay in raising the debt 
limit should be shortterm experts said 
were really talking about the timing of the bond calendar in 
a month hale said though the sale of some treasury securities 
was delayed the same total amount will be available in the month 
he noted 
had congress delayed a few more days in approving an increase in 
the debt limit the treasury may have had to put off the redemption 
of bills that matured last thursday it also could have forced the 
government to delay the issuance of certain checks such as those 
to social security recipients 
but once congress agreed to raise the debt limit and president 
bush signed the bill wednesday things began to get back to normal 
in the credit markets 
stephen meyerhardt a spokesman for the treasurys savings bond 
division said investors couldnt buy the bonds from nov 1 to last 
wednesday while the treasury was barred from raising more money 
we did get lots of calls from people and banks saying whats 
going on meyerhardt said 
he said the treasury wont know until the end of the month how 
the 5 business days during which savings bonds werent sold will 
affect sales of these popular investments the treasury sells 
anywhere from 15 million to 32 million worth of savings bonds a 
day he said 
whether or not people decided not to buy because of this 
theres no way for us to tell he said 
people who buy savings bonds through a payroll deduction plan 
should see little or no effect from the delay in bond sales 
meyerhardt said since typically it takes up to a week for an 
employer to get the bonds issued in normal times 
there were reports that some state and local governments delayed 
bond sales because they couldnt buy the treasurys state and local 
government series bonds or slugs during the debtceiling 
delay 
when states and municipalities sell a bond issue they typically 
dont need all of the proceeds at once the unneeded portion is 
invested in the slugs 
government bond issuers are barred from putting bond proceeds 
into normal investments such as certificates of deposit that 
would result in them earning higher interest rates than allowed by 
federal laws since they are nonprofit entities these laws bar 
them from making money off the proceeds of bond sales

economists say a recent wave of layoffs at 
major us companies reflects sluggishness rather than an imminent 
severe shakeout in the nations economy 
wang laboratories inc shearson lehman hutton inc chrysler 
corp unisys corp and campbell soup co have announced major 
layoffs in recent days 
but william d anderson an economist at penn state universitys 
college of business administration sees evidence of only a 
slowdown 
im yet to be convinced that that slowdown is going to lead to 
a recession anderson said 
many agree at least for the near future 
only a third of 50 economists surveyed by blue chip economic 
indicators of sedona ariz see a recession starting by the end of 
1990 another third see one in 1991 and the rest dont predict a 
recession until 1992 or beyond 
ken goldstein a labor economist with the conference board a 
new yorkbased business group sees the layoffs as part of a 
continuum over the past 6 years 
overall the number of layoffs doesnt seem to have 
significantly increased he said what is unusual during the 
last six or eight months is the number of layoffs that have been 
highly publicized 
goldstein attributes the publicity to nervousness about the 
economy a feeling he says that is not just limited to the 
investment community 
an organizedlabor economist who is among the nervous said 
layoffs must be considered in reexamining trade and technology 
policies 
its an economic problem in that were losing a lot of 
production and the associated earnings and income said markley 
roberts assistant director of the aflcios department of economic 
research in washington and then in addition you have the 
tremendous dislocation that produces a whole lot of human costs 
in terms of health and family 
roberts is concerned about recent signs from layoffs 
purists would say youve got to wait for more numbers to come 
in but i feel certain were on the verge of a slowdown or 
recession roberts said 
historically manufacturing is among the first sectors of the 
economy hit during a downturn but the past few years have left the 
economy on a high plateau that can withstand some blows anderson 
said 
unemployment in october and september was 53 percent up from 
51 percent in august but down from 54 percent in august 1988 
according to the federal bureau of labor statistics 
the latest unemployment report showed a decline in manufacturing 
jobs for the seventh straight month but a sharp increase in local 
and state government hiring as well as in health services 
employment in business services finance and real estate was up 
slightly or flat 
recent layoffs have been concentrated in a few industries 
notably auto manufacturing computers and financial services 
but they also have affected such farflung companies as 
aerospace and equipment supplier trinova corp of maumee ohio 
with 1500 employees let go the los angeles herald examiner 
newspaper which closed eliminating 831 jobs and the braniff inc 
airline which could lay off up to 2700 employees due to its 
financial troubles 
elizabeth baatz a senior economist at cahners publishing co in 
newton mass says the layoffs and voluntary severances in the 
electronics industry including computer and office and 
communications equipment makers do not indicate horrible times 
ahead 
electronics companies have held down on hiring even though 
production has climbed sharply since the industrys 198586 
recession so they do not have many extra employees she said in 
fact employment remains below the 1984 peak 
everett ehrlich vice president for economic analysis for 
unisys says the computer industry is a victim of its success in 
making smaller more powerful and less expensive equipment it 
takes fewer people to build and maintain the new machines 
the result he said is the us computer industry is not at a 
precipice the layoffs are a harsh human toll but the layoffs 
dont indicate that the industry is mature or that its being 
beaten by an influx of foreign machines

the familyheld french spirits groups e remy 
martin and cie and cointreau sa said friday they plan to merge in 
a deal that will give them a competitive boost against foreign 
giants in the beverage market 
the move is aimed at creating a premium french spirits group 
drawing on the synergies between the two companies while 
respecting the identity of each one the companies said in a 
joint statement 
the merger would create a company with annual revenue of more 
than 6 billion francs or about 1 billion the companies said 
the plan is to unite remy martins cognac champagne and premium 
wine holdings under the same umbrella as cointreaus liqueur 
armagnac rum fruit juice and luxury food products 
beyond obvious advantages in distribution this move also would 
give the family group new financial muscle to help protect it from 
big publiclytraded competitors like seagram co ltd and grand 
metropolitan plc which have been competing to acquire the 
dwindling number of quality beverage products still available 
in this respect the planned merger resembles previous alliances 
that created other french familycontrolled groups like 
moethennessy and lvmh moethennessylouis vuitton sa 
under the plan the holding company of the heriarddubreuil 
family will transfer its 51 percent interest in remy to cointreau 
and cie a holding company which controls 100 of contreau sa each 
company will retain management autonomy after the deal 
other details of the asset swap have not yet been completed but 
the companies said the heriarddubreuil family will emerge with a 
slight majority over the cointreau family in the newly formed group 
the deal requires shareholder approval which is expected in the 
coming months they said 
the decision to unite the two companies follows years of close 
cooperation in distribution throughout the pacific and the united 
states cointreau family interests have also been longterm 
shareholders in remy martin 
recent earnings data for remy martin and cointreau were not 
available since neither of the companies is publicly traded

grain and soybean futures prices closed higher 
friday on the chicago board of trade shrugging off increased 
estimates of the nations corn and soybean crop production 
corn prices were higher from the open as commercial buyers 
entered the market on reports the soviet union may make a purchase 
totalling 15 million metric tons 
you can forget the production numbers said analyst mickey 
luth of sherson lehman hutton inc in chicago the figures have 
no meaning at all what matters is the news flow producer sales 
and export sales 
the crop report released thursday by the us department of 
agriculture estimated the 1989 corn harvest at 759 billion 
bushels up 2 percent from the previous estimate and soybean 
production at 194 billion bushels 1 percent above the october 
estimate 
some analysts had predicted the crop report would trigger a 
selloff with export demand offering some support to prices 
soybean prices were higher on carryover strength from the corn 
market and strong demand for soyoil prices also received support 
from concern over delays in the planting of brazils soybean crop 
wheat prices were higher due to dryness in the winter wheat crop 
areas 
at the close wheat was 1 cents to 5 cents higher with the 
contract for delivery in december at 405 a bushel corn was

resorts international inc burdened 
with massive debt on friday said it lost 349 million in the 
third quarter and acknowledged it may be forced into bankruptcy 
proceedings 
the casino company which owes investors 900 million stopped 
paying interest to bondholders in august resorts and bondholder 
representatives have been negotiating a debt restructuring for 
several months 
regardless of the outcome of those talks resorts said it 
expects bondholders to file a petition to force the company into 
involuntary bankruptcy by nov 15 the first anniversary of 
entertainer merv griffins purchase of the company 
under federal bankruptcy laws bondholders have a year to 
contend that company insiders wrongfully paid money to immunize it 
for their own benefit from bankruptcy claims 
griffin initially put up 100 million to purchase resorts from 
developer donald trump he later withdrew 50 million but gave 
resorts a 10 million credit line 
we believe that there is probably a likelihood that a 
petition would be filed by the 15th said alison macdonald a 
resorts spokeswoman in new york 
analysts said the bondholders action was not unexpected 
certainly the bondholders are trying to protect themselves by 
having as much cash in the pot as possible said marvin b 
roffman an analyst with janney montgomery scott inc in 
philadelphia 
in august griffin told bondholders of resorts and its 
subsidiaries resorts international finance inc and griffin 
resorts inc that interest payments would be halted 
separately in the third quarter ended sept 30 resorts lost 
349 million interest alone accounted for 325 million on 
revenues of 1243 million in the yearago quarter the company 
posted a loss of 3398 million on revenues of 1239 million 
pershare figures were not available 
the company blamed lower casino revenue for the quarterly loss 
but noted that capital improvment projects should help improve some 
operations next year 
first the first nine months resorts said it lost 815 million 
on revenues of 3479 million compared with 3574 million lost on 
revenue of 3536 million for the same period in 1988

president bush today proposed a 42 billion 
spending package to help the poor buy houses and the homeless 
receive shelter and vowed to change the destructive practices 
that have blocked affordable housing in inner cities 
bush announced the program which he called a comprehensive 
agenda to help bring basic shelter and affordable housing within 
reach of millions of americans in a speech to the national 
association of realtors 
it includes 42 billion in direct grants and expenditures over 
three years and tax incentives costing an additional 27 billion 
the president did not say how he would pay for the home 
ownership and opportunity for people everywhere program jack 
kemp secretary of housing and urban development told reporters 
the money could come from a cut in the capital gains tax 
bush and the congress are haggling over whether that tax should 
be cut 
the package entailing federal programs tied to state and local 
matching funds includes 21 billion in grants to help residents 
of lowincome housing buy their units 
bush proposed that state and local governments or nonprofit 
groups pay 1 in matching funds for every 2 in federal hope 
grants the grants would be used to rehabilitate and purchase units 
in public housing vacant and foreclosed properties held by the 
government and distressed properties cited by the federal 
housing authority 
bush also offered incentives to local communities that remove 
bureaucratic barriers blocking the availability of affordable 
housing such as zoning restrictions 
he would give 210 million in insurance and rental 
rehabilitation grants for zones that best develop plans to remove 
such tax and regulatory barriers in inner city areas 
we will change the destructive practices which have kept fha 
out of the inner cities and distressed communities that most need 
its support he said he assigned kemp to name a panel that would 
recommend ways to remove barriers to affordable housing 
no city state or town should receive a single penny of hope 
funding until they have identified the barriers to affordable 
housing in their own back yard and start taking steps to remove 
them bush said 
he said the centerpiece of his hope plan was to recapture the 
american dream of home owneship for those who have been left 
behind 
he also proposed 
728 million in federal housing funds to be matched at the 
state and local level for new housing and support services for the 
homeless 
108 billion to help tenant groups buy and convert federally 
subsidized buildings to residentowned cooperatives 
allowing firsttime buyers to use individual retirement 
accounts for a home down payment without paying a penalty 
44 million for a demonstration project that would offer 
housing and support services for elderly people who otherwise would 
have to be institutionalized 
hud officials said the state and local matching funds would add 
17 billion in assistance 
bush also was attending a dinner to help texas gov bill 
clements retire 2 million in debt from his 1986 campaign and 
helping dedicate a texas memorial to vietnam veterans before flying 
home saturday 
in a speech last march 14 bush said when you look out the 
window of the white house and see the ragged pathetic figures 
huddled over the steam grates of the ellipse i see an affront to 
the american dream a national shame 
he ordered kemp then to come up with new ideas to get the 
homeless off the streets of urban america 
earlier in the year bush proposed spending 644 million in 
fiscal 1990 to carry out the mckinney act a program created to 
find housing for the homeless 
president ronald reagan was often criticized by homeless 
activists for not seeking more funds for the homeless federal 
funds for lowincome housing were cut 75 percent during the reagan 
administration 
district of columbia officials believe there are 8000 to 10000 
people living on the streets of the nations capital nationally 
some researchers estimate 300000 to 600000 americans are homeless 
on any given night some activists say the homeless number 2 
million or more 
hud has been enveloped in an influencepeddling scandal left 
over from the reagan years and kemp has devoted most of his energy 
to date to straightening out his departments procedures for 
dispensing grants and contracts

a federal bankruptcy judge on friday granted 
eastern airlines an extension of the deadline for filing its 
disclosure statement which is intended to provide details of how 
it intends to emerge from chapter 11 reorganization 
in a hearing us bankruptcy judge burton r lifland gave 
eastern until dec 29 a 45day extension to submit the disclosure 
statement and a revised reorganization plan the miamibased 
airline had requested that the nov 13 deadline for the disclosure 
statement be extended for 60 days to jan 12 
eastern also had asked the court to extend to jan 12 its 
exclusive right to submit a proposed reorganization plan during 
the exclusivity period other parties to the case cannot make 
reorganization proposals for eastern which recently submitted a 
revised plan to its major creditors 
lifland told easterns attorneys that if the airline files its 
disclosure statement by the new dec 29 deadline it would 
automatically receive a 60day extension of the exclusivity period 
easterns striking unions opposed the extensions while 
committees representing eastern creditors and preferred 
shareholders supported them 
eastern said the requests were motivated by the size and 
complexity of its bankruptcy proceeding lifland previously had 
granted eastern two extensions of its exclusivity period and one 
deferred deadline for filing the disclosure statement 
the airline which was struck by its pilots machinists and 
flight attendants on march 4 in an ongoing walkout has hired 
replacement workers and is rebuilding as a smaller carrier 
on wednesday eastern posted a thirdquarter net loss of 1852 
million after reportedly advising creditors attorneys of a 200 
million cash shortfall looming in its rebuilding plan 
also this week the house gave final congressional approval to 
legislation creating a congressional panel to investigate the 
eightmonthold strike against eastern a measure the bush 
administration has threatened to veto

an investment group including mary kay cosmetics 
has amassed a 5 percent stake in avon products inc it was 
disclosed friday in an announcement that sparked speculation about 
a renewed takeover advance on avon 
avon earlier this year rebuffed overtures from mary kay corp 
vice chairman john p rochon and rejected outright takeover 
proposals from investor irwin jacobs and rival direct seller amway 
corp 
avons management repeatedly has insisted that the company is 
better off remaining independent free to carry out plans aimed at 
improving the balance sheet 
a limited partnership calling itself chartwell associates 
notified avon that as of friday morning it held 5 percent of avons 
outstanding voting stock avon said in a news release 
chartwell in a letter did not divulge its intentions avon 
said 
avon spokesman john cox said there hadnt been any direct 
contact between avon executives and members of the investment 
group he said avon had no further comment to supplement its brief 
announcement 
trading of avon stock was temporarily halted friday for the 
announcement the stock shot up when trading resumed with the news 
spurring speculative purchases as investors bet that a takeover 
battle could be looming avon closed up 550 at 3675 a share in 
consolidated new york stock exchange trading 
the general partners in chartwell were identified as members of 
new yorks fisher family which own significant real estate 
holdings and argonaut partners headed by rochon the getty family 
trust was listed as the sole limited partner 
attempts to contact the partners for comment werent immediately 
successful 
in the spring rochon revealed that he and some investor allies 
had been interested in avon for some time 
he said in a letter dated may 25 that if mary kay succeeded in 
acquiring avon the company would be run by argonaut partners 
which he described as an investment arm of mary kay cosmetics the 
dallasbased doortodoor beauty products marketer that is the main 
unit of privately held mary kay corp 
the possibility of renewed takeover interest in avon has been 
rumored on wall street for weeks 
news last month from the company that direct sales in the united 
states probably would be disappointing in the important fourth 
quarter shopping season due largely to sagging gift and jewelry 
sales intensified the speculation 
there has been talk that disaffected shareholders might put 
pressure on avons management to take a hard look at any new 
takeover offers that come along 
the management evoked considerable stockholder consternation 
when it turned down two previous offers this year a 41ashare 
or 285 billion takeover bid from minneapolisbased investor 
jacobs was spurned as was an earlier one from amway for 39 a 
share or 21 billion 
in the wake of the rejections avon implemented new cost 
controls and speeded up the sales of certain subsidiaries mainly 
in health care services 
more recently avon has said it is looking into the possibility 
of divesting its retail fragrance division comprising giorgio 
beverly hills and parfums stern 
the cosmetics companys latest financial results show a 
continuing turnaround in profitability that analysts say could 
suffer a slight setback by the prospective slump in fourthquarter 
us sales 
avon earned 346 million or 46 cents a share in the three 
months ended sept 30 compared to a loss of 4059 million or 
778 a share in the third 1988 quarter when the company took a 
425 million aftertax charge for discontinued operations

the head of the 800000member national 
association of realtors offered the organizations support friday 
to president bushs 42 billion plan to help the poor and homeless 
were very much in favor of all the things he said outgoing 
president ira gribin said after bush unveiled the plan in a speech 
to the association 
this was the kind of thing we were looking for gribin said 
it sounds like he has bought into a lot of the things 
suggested by jack kemp secretary of housing and urban development 
kemp who accompanied bush to dallas was given a standing 
ovation by the realtors when introduced to the 4800 people at the 
meeting 
earlier friday gribin had called on the bush administration to 
provide leadership to reestablish affordable housing as a national 
goal 
this country is fundamentally moving away from an 
affordability situation and the reaffirmation of a national housing 
policy gribin a real estate agent from encino calif told 
reporters 
we need to get back on that because otherwise your kids and my 
kids and our grandchildren are not going to be able to own houses 
parts of bushs program mirrors suggestions made by the 
realtors including allowing money to be withdrawn without penalty 
from individual retirement accounts to make down payments on homes 
earlier gribin had suggested grandparents inlaws and parents 
be allowed to dip into ira savings to help the next generation of 
firsttime home buyers gribin said the realtors would continue to 
work on legislation to broaden the ira availability 
also gribin called for replacing current limits on federal 
housing administration loans with a sliding scale tying them to 
house prices in specific regions 
congress recently passed legislation raising fha loan limits to 
124878 gribin said the limit still is too low in 10 of the 
nations largest 13 metropolitan areas locking out firsttime and 
lowincome home buyers 
a study by the realtors showed that more than half of fha and 
veterans administrationbacked loans are for entrylevel buyers 
gribin said the limit should be set at 95 percent of the current 
median price in a given market

events raced ahead of wouldbe industrial 
policymakers this past week as us semiconductor companies made 
deals with ibm and the japanese 
while congress was holding hearings on the health of the vital 
us chip industry the chip makers themselves were out fending for 
themselves as best they could with mixed results 
the weeks developments again raised the question of whether 
government agencies and bluechip industry panels were either quick 
enough or patient enough to make a real contribution to the global 
battle for industrial supremacy 
conservative skeptics say governmentled industrial policy is 
fated to failure while supporters say it could work if americans 
only learned to do it right so far though both sides agree that 
the awkward early efforts are being outpaced by the real world of 
business 
three things happened this past wednesday that illustrated 
different dimensions of the issue 
us chip makers said they had reached an agreement with 
japanese electronics companies that eventually could allow the 
americans to make customized chips for the next generation of 
japanese televisions 
international business machines corp said it would license the 
technology for making its most powerful computer memory chip to 
micron technology inc of boise idaho 
and in washington the head of the governmentsupported chip 
consortium sematech told a congressional committee that the us 
effort to regain supremacy in chips is in jeopardy the statement 
from robert noyce came as talk circulated that the bush 
administration wants to cut back on some research projects 
including sematech 
in part the deal between us chipmakers and japanese companies 
was a rare victory for us government efforts to get a bigger 
share of the japanese chip market but it also illustrated that the 
united states continues to negotiate from a position of weakness 
american companies will get from japan the information they need 
to design chips for the japanese but there is no guarantee that 
japan actually will buy americanmade chips 
the us chip makers would like to make circuits for 
americanmade highdefinition televisions as well although the 
bush administrations decision not to make a fullfledged 
commitment to hdtv could bog down development of that technology 
businesses are going to move forward whether the government 
does or not said jeanne alford a spokeswoman for the 
semiconductor industry association 
ibm made its deal with micron technologies to ensure that there 
would be another source of usmade memory chips ibm said it also 
intended to supply its technology to a chipmaking consortium 
called us memories inc of which it is a strong backer 
unfortunately for industrial policy mavens us memories has 
been slow to get off the ground since its inception in june 
critics say a joint manufacturing venture wont work and they say 
that ibm through its deal with micron has essentially made us 
memories unnecessary something ibm disputes 
most disheartening to the supporters of industrial policy were 
impressions perhaps unfounded that the bush administrations 
commitment to sematech and the usjapanese chip trade agreement 
was waning at a critical time 
rep mel levine dcalif said his office had gotten leaks 
saying high administration officials are conducting a 
slashandburn campaign seeking to systematically eliminate most of 
the major initiatives designed to return this country to the 
industrial cutting edge 
what i find marvelous about our government is that they 
criticize business for being shortsighted then they show 
incredible volatility in programs that take five years or more to 
play out said william finan a managing director of the 
washington consulting firm of quick finan amp associates 
in other business and economic news this past week 
ford motor co chairman donald petersen who guided the company 
to record profitability during the late 1980s announced he will 
retire march 1 vice chairman harold poling is slated to take the 
helm of the nations secondlargest automaker 
the federal reserve eased credit to counter a slowdown in the 
economy which was marked by layoffs at several major companies 
but the signs of weakness were countered by a labor department 
report that wholesale prices rose 04 percent in october 
east germany opened the berlin wall and gave its citizens 
permission to freely cross the rest of its borders in a move that 
experts said would have immediate benefits for american companies 
in west germany although the shortterm prospects for us 
multinationals in east germany were uncertain

the latest easing of credit by the federal 
reserve has been greeted with something short of allout elation on 
wall street 
just about every fedwatcher in the financial world agreed that 
the fed sent out signals this past week that it was relaxing its 
credit policy further continuing a series of moves in that 
direction over the past several months 
but analysts readings of the motivations for that step were not 
so unanimous 
the first and most popular interpretation was that the fed was 
satisfied with the progress of recent efforts to keep inflation in 
check and saw a chance to cushion the potential impact of a 
slowing economy 
that view offered reassurance to investors who have been worried 
that the recent dropoff in corporate earnings might be a portent of 
more bad news to come on profits and a possible recession in early 
1990 
some observers however suggested that it wasnt inflation that 
was uppermost in fed policymakers minds but rather concern in 
some form about a possible deflationary situation 
since late summer many a wary eye has been focused on the market 
for junk bonds highyielding securities used to finance buyouts 
and other deals amid signs that the lending boom of the late 1980s 
might be ending 
at the same time a massive campaign continues to unscramble the 
problems of the nations network of savings institutions 
and less specific worries lately have been voiced about the 
potential effects of weak real estate markets in places such as the 
northeast where the market for properties had been rising for a 
long time 
the federal reserve does not need a new credit crisis said 
james grant in the issue published friday of his newsletter grants 
interest rate observer 
grant posited the theory that inflation is guiding monetary 
policy in most of the worlds financial centers but deflation is 
calling the tune in ours 
such talk combined with worries about profit disappointments at 
many companies kept the stock market on the defensive in the past 
week 
the dow jones average of 30 industrials slipped 390 to 262561 
the new york stock exchange composite index rose 062 to 18790 
the nasdaq composite index for the overthecounter market gained 
282 to 45579 and the american stock exchange market value index 
was down 032 at 37147 
volume on the big board averaged 14876 million shares a day 
against 14818 million the week before 
the potential hazards of leverage large amounts of debt in 
many forms in the american economy have been debated on wall 
street for years 
but lately there have been several signs that concern about the 
situation has been increasing 
for one thing the calm news on inflation of late would not 
explain why the prices of gold and goldmining stocks have rallied 
in recent days but heightened worries about deflation could well 
account for the upswing in precious metals 
published commentaries by several brokerage firms have recently 
broached the term financial distress 
some of the words that define financial distress seem 
appropriate today observed hugh johnson at first albany corp in 
albany ny they would include uneasiness apprehension 
tension stringency pressure uncertainty and fragility 
some of the main concerns johnson cites touch on a familiar 
theme as the economy slows highly leveraged companies will have 
difficulty making debt service payments and investors will have 
difficulty in arranging for financing to acquire companies 
from time to time he says there are likely to be shocks 
to the financial system 
fortunately he adds we feel that they for the most 
part are manageable if many shocks do not occur simultaneously 
financial distress and rising stock prices are not mutually 
exclusive

some analysts had predicted the crop report would trigger a

late thursday with its yield at 789 percent 
analysts said bond prices were little changed after the federal 
reserve entered the market for a second day to drain reserves from 
the banking system 
the intervention which began on thursday suggested that the 
fed does not want the key federal funds rate to fall below 8 
percent said elizabeth reiners vice president for moneymarket 
research at dean witter reynolds inc

to rise because no one was forecasting the move ms reiners said 
the federal funds rate the interest on overnight loans between 
banks was quoted late in the day at 8 percent unchanged from 
late thursday 
analysts said the feds draining action signaled a retreat from 
a maneuver earlier in the week that had suggested the central bank 
was relaxing its credit policy and encouraging lower interest 
rates on monday and tuesday the central bank injected billions of 
dollars of reserves into the market pushing shortterm interest 
rates lower

the opening of the berlin wall and lifting of 
travel restrictions on east german citizens could have immediate 
benefits for american companies in west germany although 
shortterm prospects for us multinationals to expand into east 
germany are unclear experts said friday 
any move to the east by american and other multinationals wont 
happen overnight without a change in the current political 
structure of the communist nation but sweeping changes could occur 
in the next decade 
within the next five years we will start to see noticeable 
and significant flows of money and goods from west to east said 
ed yardeni economist with prudentialbache securities inc 
woolworth corp the retailer that has done business in west 
berlin for 65 years said the flow of thousands of east berliners 
across the border this week already had boosted sales of its west 
german operations 
theyre already shopping at our stores theyve been very 
crowded in the last 24 hours said roy l garofalo woolworths 
vice president of investor relations in new york 
theyre not wealthy people but many may have savings because 
there was nothing to buy in east germany 
woolworth has 225 general merchandise stores in west germany 
including 24 in west berlin 
woolworth stock rose 325 to 6087 a share friday on the new 
york stock exchange on what one analyst attributed to positive 
sentiment about the political events in east germany 
elsewhere on wall street germany fund recorded one of the days 
biggest percentage gains the fund finished up 275 at 1350 a 
share as the west german stock market where the fund invests 
responded to the opening of the east german borders 
officials of ford motor co which has been in west germany 
since 1925 said they were watching closely as events unfolded 
vice chairman harold poling who will become chairman and chief 
executive of ford on march 1 said the worlds second largest 
automobile maker was looking at all the opportunities 
ford has manufacturing and assembly operations throughout west 
germany that employ about 37500 people 
analysts said the opening of east germany and recent events in 
poland and hungary point to tremendous opportunities for americans 
and other industrialists around the world but any increased 
business in the eastern bloc nations will depend on the timing of 
political reforms strategists said 
they will need a new political structure before anyone will 
know what to do said lawrence a veit international economist 
with brown brothers harriman amp co 
it will be negative for the defense industry but positive a 
larger positive for all other companies veit said 
west german companies will have the competitive edge in the 
eastern bloc once the reforms get under way economists said 
multinational companies already doing business in west germany will 
be positioned to enter the east german market behind the west 
germans but american companies will get a fair share of the market 
if they move aggressively yardeni said 
the rush to invest in eastern europe will depend on how 
quickly western money and western capitalists are willing to move 
in he said 
woolworths garofalo said that as recently as six weeks ago 
woolworth officials were in east germany to explore future 
opportunities 
there was some writing on the wall even a few weeks ago he 
said 
but any move into east germany is still at least two years away 
garofalo said

a delaware chancery court judge has 
denied a motion sought by the du pont co to prohibit a research 
company from paying its dividends the companies are in a joint 
venture that has gone sour 
in a ruling issued earlier this week vice chancellor jack b 
jacobs denied a preliminary injunction sought by du pont against 
hem research inc 
neither company returned telephone calls late friday afternoon 
du pont and hem which has headquarters in philadelphia formed 
a joint venture in 1987 for the development marketing and 
distribution of a drug called ampligen which they said would be 
used in treating acquired immune deficiency syndrome and cancer 
but in april du pont filed suit in chancery court seeking 30 
million and an end to the joint venture the suit alleged hem 
misrepresented the effectiveness of ampligen and sought the 
preliminary injunction to block payment of dividends 
chancellor william allen denied the request to end the joint 
venture saying chancery court had no jurisdiction over that issue 
the court however indicated it could rule on the issue of the 
dividends 
du pont had claimed in its motion that hem would become 
insolvent if it paid its dividends and other business charges 
jacobs said du ponts argument was factually unsupported and 
legally unsound 
hem is not presently insolvent and the proposed dividend and 
other payments will not render it insolvent jacobs said 
as of dec 31 1988 hem had a net worth of 85 million the 
proposed dividends and other payments were about 1154 million

mcdonalds corps nationwide promotion 
of mcrib barbecued pork sandwiches has helped prop up prices in the 
nations hog markets an economist says 
economist glenn grimes at the university of missouri says that 
if the 8000restaurant fastfood chain makes the sandwich a 
permanent part of the menu it would open a significant new market 
for pork 
but he adds that would translate into longterm support for 
higher prices only if producers break with traditional practice and 
refuse to increase hog production in response to the increased 
demand 
if past experience is any guide he says hog farmers will raise 
more pigs in anticipation of increased sales to mcdonalds 
five years from now wed have basically the same hog price if 
they mcdonalds did it or not he said in a telephone interview 
mcrib made its debut in several test markets earlier in the 
1980s and was revived last month for a nationwide test 
mcdonalds is not disclosing its plans for mcrib once a 
monthlong national advertising campaign for the sandwiches ends 
nov 20 but public relations consultant russ klettke said friday 
that the sales are going well the feeling is very optimistic 
he said preliminary figures on the performance of the sandwich 
are as yet unreliable and that even if meaningful results were 
available the company would not want them made public because of 
competition 
when the promotion was launched last month mcdonalds said it 
planned to serve 80 million of the fourounce boneless shoulder 
cuts which are prepared in a hickoryflavored sauce with pickles 
and onions on a homestyle roll 
klettke said mcdonalds not only would analyze the performance 
of mcrib but the impact of its sales on the sales of its other 
sandwiches and whether there are regional trends in sales he also 
said analysts would consider whether the product might have 
seasonal or yearround appeal 
the promotion which began oct 20 will run for four to six 
weeks depending on the market even though the national 
advertising ends after one month klettke said 
grimes who specializes in the pork industry estimates the 
promotion is using 15 percent to 23 percent of the current supply 
of hogs nationwide 
each 1 percent change in supplies influences prices of live hogs 
by 185 percent to 2 percent grimes said he estimated the added 
demand for a limited supply of hogs is bidding up the price of live 
hogs by about 125 cents to 185 cents a pound 
the restaurant chain already serves bacon sausage and canadian 
bacon as part of its breakfast menu it also is experimenting with 
pizza which could have sausage pepperoni or other pork toppings

imperial oil ltds proposed takeover of texaco 
canada inc wont be approved until a better deal is worked out to 
protect competition the federal competition tribunal said friday 
in a preliminary decision 
the deal worth 5 billion canadian dollars would be the 
secondlargest corporate takeover in canadas history imperial oil 
and texaco canada both are subsidiaries of us companies imperial 
oil is owned by exxon corp and texaco canada by texaco inc 
tribunal chairman barbara reed said a deal imperial oil worked 
out with the federal competition bureau to sell off 611 gasoline 
stations and other assets didnt go far enough in several areas 
however she indicated that if imperial and the bureau can work 
out a better deal the tribunal could still give the merger a green 
light 
we are not prepared to approve the consent order in its 
present terms ms reed said in her decision the most dramatic 
since the competition act was made stricter in 1986 
a monthlong hearing into the proposed takeover ended wednesday 
with a warning from the consumers association of canada that the 
deal would cost motorists at the gasoline pump 
ms reed who delivered the sometimes harshly worded verbal 
decision said she wanted to give imperial oil a quick indication 
of where it stands the deal has been awaiting federal approval 
since it was struck in january 
she criticized calvin goldman former director of the bureau 
for his handling of the merger especially for allowing imperial 
oil and texaco canada to start operating like one company before 
the tribunal ruled 
the two companies have been running a joint advertising 
campaign for example

bicoastal corp formerly singer co headed 
by onetime corporate raider paul bilzerian filed for chapter 11 
bankruptcy protection friday following a tumultuous two years of 
legal battles and divestments 
a company annoucement said bicoastal expects to file a 
reorganization plan soon seeking to provide for the payment of 
valid creditors and provide a method to resolve disputed claims 
bicoastal said the filing does not affect its remaining 
subsidiaries which include makers of aircraft and nuclear plant 
training simulators and weapons control systems 
officials at tampabased bicoastal could not be reached late 
friday 
singer renamed earlier this year was acquired by bilzerian in 
january 1988 in a 106 billion takeover bilzerian sold off eight 
of the companys 12 divisions including some of the most 
profitable and sparked a flood of employee lawsuits and other 
litigation estimated to exceed 500 million 
in june bilzerian was convicted on nine counts of securities 
fraud conspiracy to commit tax fraud and making false statements 
to the government three months later he was sentenced to a 
fouryear prison term and fined 15 million 
it is uncertain how the bankruptcy filing will affect the 
reported 75 million purchase of mesa limited partnerships 
interest in bicoastal 
the wall street journal on friday reported that new yorkbased 
leucadia national corp agreed in principle to buy the stock and 
notes mesa acquired in connection with bilzerians takeover 
mesa an amarillo texasbased partnership headed by raider t 
boone pickens loaned bilzerians group 150 million and negotiated 
an option to take control of the singer board if the company failed 
by pay the entire loan plus interest by april 1 1989 the date was 
later extended to july 1 
the pact could give leucadia control of the board of bicoastal 
a 138yearold company that grew from a sewing machine manufacturer 
to a major defense contractor 
there was no answer at leucadias new york office late friday 
in may us district court judge herbert murray in baltimore 
placed an injunction against transfer of any major singer assets 
without court approval

the union representing united airlines pilots 
said friday it has urged its members to support its continued 
efforts to gain control of parent company ual corp 
the pilots union also disclosed that since a pilotmanagement 
bid for the airline failed last month it has had conservations 
with los angeles billionaire marvin davis who previously bid for 
ual new york investor saul steinberg the investment firm coniston 
partners and other financial investors 
the union also said spoken with the machinists union and would 
have further discussions 
the letter did not elaborate on any of the discussions and a 
spokesman for the pilots union did not return calls friday 
ual declined to comment on the latest development said 
spokeswoman sara dornacker 
in trading friday on the new york stock exchange ual rose 425 
a share to 18950 
the air line pilots association leadership released a letter 
sent thursday urging members to strictly enforce their existing 
labor contract beginning nov 22 when a selfimposed deadline on 
voluntary labor concessions expires 
the pilots are seeking a new contract to replace the one that 
expired in april 1988 however the pilots leadership stated in the 
letter that continued takeover moves toward ual made it doubtful an 
agreement could be reached soon 
given that the company is obviously in play we see no way 
that management will get serious about an equitable new contract 
unless it knows who is going to own the company the letter 
said in our view the piece of trash that the company recently 
passed across the table clearly proves that fact 
unless the entire world clearly understands what we contribute 
or dont contribute to the operation of the airline we will have 
little chance of getting either an equitable new contract or an 
appropriate new employee stock ownership proposal to be put to 
the board and accepted 
it called on pilots to prepare to stop flying uniteds new 747 
model 400s and working four extra hours a month the pilots had 
been doing both as a show of good faith during its participation in 
a pilotmanagement bid for the airline 
pilots and management signed a merger agreement with uals board 
in september as a show of good faith pilots said they would fly 
uniteds 747 model 400s they previously would not fly and work an 
85hour workmonth rather than the 81 hours stipulated in their 
contract the pilots had refused to fly the model 400s because of a 
dispute over how many crew members should be used 
when the deal fell apart in october when the group was unable to 
obtain financing for its 675 billion offer the employee group 
again approached the board with a framework for a restructured 
transaction but the board at that time terminated the 
negotiations the union said 
we intend to work intensively over the next two weeks to 
put together a new transaction so that the new owners of ual will 
in fact be the employees and not some unwanted outsider the 
pilots union said in the letter 
earlier this week the ual board reportedly authorized chairman 
stephen wolf to explore new means of mounting a buyout or 
recapitalization of the company 
on wednesday coniston partners which has accumulated a 97 
percent stake in ual met with machinists of united to detail their 
intentions for the company coniston has said it intends to oust 
most of uals board 
the machinists had declined to join an effort by united pilots 
flight attendants and management for employee ownership of the 
airline
