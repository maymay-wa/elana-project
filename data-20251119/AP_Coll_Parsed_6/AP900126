a panel of federal judges on friday refused 
to let louisiana resume enforcing an old criminal law against 
abortion saying the 1855 statute had been superseded by newer 
legislation 
the louisiana lawsuit was one of the first initiatives to outlaw 
abortions under provisions last years us supreme court ruling 
that gave states more authority to restrict abortions 
louisiana attorney general william guste said he was 
disappointed and was considering an appeal of fridays ruling by a 
special threejudge panel 
dawn johnsen legal director for the national abortion rights 
action league in washington dc called the ruling a tremendous 
defeat for district attorney harry connick who was trying to 
resurrect an extreme law from 1855 and send women back to the 1800s 
when all abortions were prohibited in the state of louisiana 
hes been put in his place and will have to act openly and 
honestly through the legislature she said 
connick who was joined by guste in seeking reinstatement of the 
antiabortion laws declined to comment a spokesman said 
the threejudge panel was set up in the mid1970s after several 
individuals and at least one womens clinic in new orleans 
challenged louisianas antiabortion laws considered some of the 
most restrictive in the nation 
the result was a 1976 injunction that forbade louisiana to 
enforce the statutes 
the basis for the plaintiffs initial request was the 1973 roe 
vs wade decision in which the us supreme court gave women the 
right to have abortions 
among other things the 1855 law required 10 years at hard labor 
for doctors convicted of performing abortions 
the current round of court action followed the us supreme 
courts ruling last year in webster vs reproductive services a 
missouri case in which the high court gave states more power than 
they previously had to restrict abortion 
the webster ruling prompted louisiana officials to ask the 
threejudge federal court last october to dissolve its 1976 
injunction 
on friday the panel refused saying the louisiana legislature 
in effect repealed most of the states abortion laws in 1978 when 
it passed guidelines under which abortions could be legally 
performed 
each act in the guidelines contained provisions stating 
that all laws or parts of laws in conflict herewith are hereby 
repealed the court said in an eightpage opinion 
the guidelines left one antiabortion law unchanged the 
statute making it illegal to advertise the availability of 
abortions but the court refused to allow enforcement of that 
provision 
the special panel consists of judge eugene davis of the 5th us 
circuit court of appeal and us district judges morey sear and 
martin lc feldman

achieved positive results he did not repeat the speech as is 
common in haiti in creole the language of 90 percent of the 
islanders 
avril imposed the state of siege on jan 20 one day after the 
killing of army col andre neptune his wife and a housemaid by 
unidentified gunmen 
in his speech friday night at the national parliament avril 
blamed the killing and a general atmosphere of insecurity on 
terrorists and political demogogues and said it would have 
been cowardly of the government not to take tough action 
avril read the speech from behind a desk the haitian flag to 
his side he was wearing a shortsleeved army shirt 
earlier friday france haitis largest donor suspended 
economic aid and talks on a 500 million development package to 
protest the military governments crackdown on critics 
in paris the foreign ministry said in a statement that france 
took the action because of the scope of human rights violations 
and the interruption of public liberties in haiti 
more than 50 militants have been arrested since the state of 
siege was declared last saturday most have been released saying 
they were beaten but seven prominent leaders have been exiled to 
the united states or france and a radical political leader was 
reported missing thursday 
also friday the italian embassy issued a statement in the name 
of the 12nation european community condemning the repression and 
saying the ec considers the measures taken by the military 
government as having serious implications for political freedoms 
and human rights 
french minister of cooperation jacques pelletier canceled a 
visit scheduled for last monday after ruler lt gen prosper avril 
decreed the state of siege said a french embassy spokesman 
an aid package valued at 500 million during the next two years 
was to have been negotiated at the suspended meeting of the 
haitianfrench cooperation commission said a haitian official who 
spoke on the condition of anonymity 
france haitis former colonial ruler was the most generous 
international donor to haiti in 1989 giving 50 million for 
development projects 
aid continued at about the same level this year but in paris 
the foreign ministry said current payments to haiti also were being 
cut 
critics have accused avril of using the colonels killing as a 
pretext to crack down on the opposition and renege on his promise 
to hold free elections in october 
france asks the haitian government urgently to reestablish 
the suspended provisions of the constitution to reverse the 
measures of detention and banishment of opposition leaders and to 
guarantee the restarting of an authentic election process the 
foreign ministry statement said 
avril attended neptunes funeral friday about 400 people were 
present including several soldiers though they were not heavily 
armed 
rockefeller guerre head of the leftist union of patriotic 
democrats party and an outspoken critic of avril has been missing 
since monday his wife said three other prominent critics of avril 
remained in hiding friday relatives said 
haiti one of the worlds poorest nations received 154 million 
in international assistance in 1988 but had been the object of 
international ostracism since the november 1987 electionday 
massacre of 34 people that authorities say was staged by thugs 
working with the army 
the us government cut off about twothirds of its 90 million 
aid package after the massacre but haiti still receives about 40 
million in us aid through private voluntary organizations

a man at the center of the fbi probe 
into two fatal pipe bombings said friday that frustration over a 
civil lawsuit prompted him to write a 1988 letter calling americas 
legal system corrupt 
the letter to the 11th us circuit court of appeals in atlanta 
is what drew investigators attention to junk dealer robert wayne 
oferrell 46 one of the judges on the court was killed in a 
series of pipe bombings that also claimed the life of a 
civilrights lawyer 
oferrell said he wrote the appeals court during a legal fight 
with his former employer gulf life insurance co 
i had two lawyers quit me when i wrote that letter i didnt 
know what else to do to fight it he said 
oferrell has denied any knowledge of the mail bomb killings 
and has not been officially named as a suspect by the fbi 
he commented friday as he reopened his salvage store which had 
been closed since monday when scores of federal investigators 
descended on it looking for clues in the prechristmas bombings 
i want them to get through and apologize oferrell said of 
the fbi agents things like that just dont happen in the us 
they dont intimidate people and talk to people like they have 
me this week 
killed in the bombings were 11th circuit court of appeals judge 
robert vance of birmingham and attorney robert robinson of 
savannah ga who had done work for the national association for 
the advancement of colored people 
vance was a member of the threejudge panel of the 11th circuit 
that upheld a lower courts ruling against oferrell in his lawsuit 
a letter from what appeared to be an unknown white supremacist 
group claiming responsibility for the bombings was sent to an 
atlanta television station the letter was written on a typewriter 
matching the one used in oferrells earlier letter to the 11th 
circuit according to investigators who spoke on condition of 
anonymity 
fbi agents searched oferrells property extensively even 
sending divers to scour the bottom of a pond but refused to 
discuss what they might have found 
the fbi also has consulted a scotland yard bomb expert to 
determine if there is any similarity between the mail bombs and 
devices used by the irish republican army a law enforcement source 
in washington who spoke on condition of anonymity said friday 
in addition the fbi is checking any possible connection between 
the package bombs and brian joseph fleming an enterprise ala 
man recently indicted on charges of illegally exporting 
highpowered weapons according to federal law enforcement sources 
in washington 
the sources who spoke on condition of anonymity stressed there 
wasnt any reason to believe there was a connection with fleming 
who federal authorities are investigating for possible links to the 
outlawed ira 
flemings attorney john l knowles said there was no 
connection whatsoever between oferrell and fleming who owns a 
printing business fleming knew who oferrell is but isnt really 
familiar with him the attorney said

summer haute couture with a parade of his gala couture clothes for 
women who want to look on the sexy side 
spanishborn paco rabanne won the golden thimble award for his 
amusing lively collection that made full use of new materials 
like fringed raffia crystalglobe embroideries and sequined 
leather 
twotime winner christian lacroix finished a close second in the 
semiannual prize awarded by an international jury of fashion 
journalists 
givenchys show on thursday was magnificent from caramel 
leather shorts topped by fresh and airy white linen blouses to the 
most extravagantly opulent evening wear the show ranked as one of 
best this master of the fine art of couture has ever produced 
his narrow rustic linen suits or belted kneerevealing dresses 
in shades of bright blue rust peach and golden sand with their 
bold silver buttons couldnt be faulted for daytime 
givenchy brought out plenty of trouser suits tailored in soft 
gabardines or shiny linen tweeds he solved the dilemma of 
seethrough chiffon blouses with a whitedotted transparent black 
number sporting a big floppy bow to hide bosom details 
the sharp givenchy silhouette with padded shoulders in suits was 
softened up with considerable sexiness for lateday wear even the 
bridal number was barely more than a sprig of pastel silk flowers 
on a prancing nude 
but the main elements of style were there almost every evening 
outfit was a showstopper his enormousflowered gazar and organza 
evening gowns were breathtaking the fabrics featured bold poppies 
daisies lilies of the valley or daffodils on hotcolored 
backgrounds of kelly green citron tomato purple or fuchsia 
some white faille bustier gowns with blacklace embroidery 
glowing with sirenred chiffon or affeta wraps were dynamite 
guaranteeing a grand entrance 
valentino who has shown luxury readytowear for 10 years in 
paris has finally abandoned italy as a showcase choosing a 
trocadero museum auditorium for his second paris couture show 
on wednesday night he brought out a dazzling show of glamorous 
clothes for rich women the outfits looking particularly light and 
young 
he led off and ended with swingy short clothes in his original 
signature color of white suits cut with longer jackets and short 
skirts waves of accordion pleats around for dancing skirts 
otherwise valentino spiced the show with lots of his favorite 
hot reds and soft tones like celdadon wisteria peach and silvery 
gray in the softest of fabrics like cashmere silk crepe and acres 
of flounced chiffon a paris must for couture 
valentino used a lot of tricky latticework in his lateday 
toppers and the sumptuous evening wear included all kinds of 
elaborate draping pleated transparent capes sequined pastille 
embroideries on chiffon and tiers of lace 
per spook as usual went his own way in a simplified sporty view 
of couture that has nothing to do with pretension or grandiose 
entrances 
except for a few charming buttoned jersey short shift dresses 
he seemed allergic to leggy looks his trouser outfits were cut a 
bit baggy around the ankle and he often topped these with cute 
layered styles from a bustier top to a blousejacket 
but if the 1990s are going to be full of color and feminine 
clothes as most couturiers seem to think spooks best 
contributions are in some of his bright print sporty toppers and 
adorable evening wear

starvation a constant peril in the war 
zone of southern sudan once again threatens hundreds of thousands 
of people because of intense fighting and government mismanagement 
francis junod who runs the international committee of the red 
cross relief operation said 350000 of the regions perennially 
malnourished residents may die unless supplies get through by the 
end of february 
junod said his agency could not accept conditions accompanying a 
government offer announced on television wednesday to end a 
2month ban on supply flights 
he said the red cross was told its planes could fly only to the 
governmentheld city of juba which would violate the agencys 
pledge to fight famine in areas held by rebels as well as the 
government 
obstruction and neglect by 7monthold military junta have 
strained its relations with most relief organizations 
a train loaded with relief supplies has sat since september in 
babanoussa a railway switching center just north of the famine 
area the army commandeered the locomotives to haul weapons and 
un officials decided not to hitch on the relief cars because of 
the risk 
i think the new regime is not wellcoordinated for what to 
them is not a vital matter a western relief worker said its 
more mismanagement than the northern governments not helping the 
southerners 
some workers privately accuse the government of limiting the 
access to famile areas in order to hide evidence of government 
atrocities 
lt gen omar hassan elbashir leader of the junta has accused 
relief personnel of smuggling weapons and supplies 
some agencies are leaving because of the problems made worse by 
an offensive of the rebel sudan peoples liberation army 
the rebels seek more autonomy from arab moslems who domate the 
north for an an area the size of texas populated by blacks who are 
predominantly christian or animist 
fighting in the rebel offensive launched in october has been the 
most intense of the war which began in 1983 
both sides have used food and deprivation as weapons 
in 1988 the worst year for innocent civilians hundreds of 
thousands of people starved to death in the swamps jungles and 
deserts of the south un officials put the total at 250000 but 
others said the number was twice that 
the united nations began operation lifelinesudan last year to 
prevent another disaster it used airlifts nile river barges 
trucks and trains to get food into position before floods isolated 
vast areas during the rainy season 
generally it worked but a donor meeting scheduled for november 
to pledge support for this year has not been held relief officials 
blame the government for the delay 
junod deputy head of the international committee of red cross 
in geneva said about 100000 people in the bahr elghazal region 
and another 250000 in juba the principal city of the south were 
most in danger of starving 
right now it has the potential for disaster he said 
the government banned relief flights nov 3 ostensibly to allow 
time to investigate two unexplained bombing raids on 
rebelcontrolled airfields areas being supplied by operation 
lifeline 
since then the governmentheld towns aweil and gogrial and the 
rebel strongholds of mayen abun and akon have not been resupplied 
within a month to six weeks the people in these towns will 
have to move to look for food junod said we want to try to 
avoid large migrations because many die on the away 
juba capital of the equatoria region 750 miles south of 
khartoum the national capital has been under rebel siege for 
months 
rebel gunners shelled the city this week killing about 20 
civilians by un count and urged residents to evacuate some 
relief workers have left but there is no place for the civilians 
to go 
red cross food stocks in juba can feed the population for a 
month junod said a trickle of supplies 5060 tons daily arrives 
on an airlift of the lutheran world federation but each shipment 
is enough to for only a day 
right now it does not look possible to help the people in 
northern bahr elghazal and juba junod said we fear there 
will be human losses 
the lutheran airlift from nairobi in neighboring kenya flies 
without guarantees of safe passage from either the rebels or 
government and how long it can continue remains a question rebel 
gunners have shot down at least two civilian aircraft during the 
war with the loss of more than 75 lives 
after more than two months of effort the red cross has obtained 
government and rebel approval for a few flights into the south to 
evacuate most of its workers junod said 
he said the agency would leave only few people there the united 
nations also plans to take nonessential personnel out of the south 
medicine without borders a french group that already has left 
lost four staff members to the war last month when their small 
plane was shot down neither side has accepted responsibility 
relief workers say government agents confiscated shortwave 
radios from southern cities removing their only means of 
communicating with khartoum and that cooperation from military 
commanders in the field has become rare 
bashir publicly declared support for operation lifeline 
however and it moved 110000 tons of food and supplies into the 
south last summer during a ceasefire he extended month by month

what began as a territorial dispute has become an 
allout crusade by azerbaijanis and armenians to achieve ethnic 
nationalistic and religious goals 
suspicions and hostilities with deep historical roots are 
fueling the wave of unrest that began two years ago and escalated 
jan 13 into brutal ethnic attacks and open warfare 
the latent tension was exacerbated by current conditions in the 
caucasus the feeling that economic and political reforms have not 
improved peoples lives in the largely underdeveloped region 
plagued by unemployment and environmental woes 
the conflict has turned the rugged hills of the southern 
caucasus into what even soviet officials have called mikhail s 
gorbachevs lebanon the most protracted and bloodiest 
manifestations of the ethnic strife sweeping the soviet union and 
one of the most serious crises he has faced 
it has encompassed 15 million people including residents of 
both republics as well as members of the two ethnic groups in 
neighboring georgia and southern russia 
such diverse observers as world chess champion garri kasparov 
an armenianjew who was born in the azerbaijani capital of baku 
and soviet first deputy foreign minister alexander bessmertnykh 
agree that ethnic not religious motivations are foremost 
armenians are predominantly christians and azerbaijanis shiite 
moslem 
western scholars call it an ethnic conflict with religious 
overtones 
fanatical azerbaijanis vowed to drive all armenians off their 
land 
the azerbaijani peoples front which has spearheaded the 
antiarmenian campaign has also called for their republic to 
secede from the soviet union and establish special ties with 
iran and other islamic countries 
it is not just idle talk 
most armenians were indeed forced out and the peoples front 
was involved in the destruction of border defenses on soviet 
azerbaijans frontier with iran this month protesters called for 
reunifying soviet azerbaijan and the two azerbaijani provinces of 
iran a region that was part of persia until russian expansion 
under the czars forced its division in 1828 
tempers of armenians and azerbaijanis flared for nearly two 
years heating up each time politicians in baku moscow or the 
armenian capital of yerevan made decisions concerning 
nagornokarabakh the poor hilly district of 186000 people 
mostly armenians that is claimed by both sides 
nagornokarabakh became a battle cry that woke up ancient 
hostilities between armenians and azerbaijanis the weekly magazine 
ogonyok on sunday published an appeal to armenians and azerbaijanis 
to win over each other with love and forgiveness not weapons and 
fire the appeal dates back to july 1905 
but there has been little attempt to hide the hatred 
as the feud produced hundreds of thousands of refugees the 
hatred increased and the stones torches and guns came out 
hostages were taken railroad bridges blown up water pipes 
severed homes burned and soviet troops ambushed 
the voice of reason has been losing out to extremism said 
arkady i volsky formerly the kremlins handpicked administrator 
of nagornokarabakh the point was driven home to him after meeting 
with elderly armenians and azerbaijanis in a tiny village 
the oldsters emerged from the meeting in a mood of 
reconciliation but young people inflamed by nationalist rhetoric 
did not go along with them volsky told the magazine new times 
much of the bitterness he said comes from refugees who 
account for 10 percent of the districts population 
these uprooted people are behind all the rallies and 
disobedience campaign they are the base for every kind of 
extremism the kremlin official said even before the latest and 
most bloody flareup 
an estimated 220000 armenian refugees from azerbaijan have 
settled in their home republic many without jobs or homes and more 
than willing to take up arms to fight those who drove them away 
unemployment in armenia is reported to be 18 percent 
refugees are also prime recruits for ethnic militiants in 
azerbaijan where unemployment is even higher 276 percent more 
than 200000 azerbaijanis fled nagornokarabakh and armenia the 
soviet press has suggested it was these downtrodden azerbaijani 
refugees who attacked armenians in baku to drive them out and grab 
their apartments 
class antagonism also may have played a role many of the 
armenians living in baku were better educated than azerbaijanis and 
financially in privileged positions because of their jobs in the 
oil industry that dominates the city 
azerbaijanis also saw the armenians attempt to regain 
nagornokarabakh as an insult to their national pride and moscows 
attempts to mediate as an infringement on their sovereignty 
without shusha azerbaijan has no soul goes an azerbaijani 
saying that refers to a town in nagornokarabakh that historically 
has been peopled by azerbaijanis 
armenians are driven by the feeling that their people were 
discriminated against in nagornokarabakh under azerbaijani 
leaders cut off from their home republic deprived of their 
culture religion and adequate schools and hospitals 
the armenians solution end the artificial separation of 
nagornokarabakh and armenia with its more sympathetic leadership 
both sides accuse moscow of indecision that made matters worse 
the antisoviet factor took on added significance after soviet 
troops smashed into baku on jan 20 killing dozens of people the 
action brought more support for a complete political break with 
moscow and led to attacks on bakus russian residents 
the azerbaijan peoples front alleges moscow provoked the jan 
13 rampages against armenians in baku

president bushs nominee to become the justice 
departments civil rights chief acknowledges he lacks broad 
experience on the issue but says he has an understanding and a 
sensitivity about civil rights 
former new york state sen john r dunne was nominated thursday 
by bush to be assistant attorney general for civil rights a post 
that has been vacant since december 1988 bushs first choice 
william lucas failed to win senate confirmation last august 
dunne 59 of garden city ny spent 24 years in the new york 
state senate where he was chairman of the judiciary committee he 
resigned in september after losing a battle for republican majority 
leader and is currently a partner in a long island law firm 
on the eve of his nomination dunne acknowledged i havent 
had as much experience as im sure many civil rights activists 
perhaps would like to see 
still he said he has an understanding and a sensitivity and 
caring about the issue 
after initial reports in november that dunne was in line for the 
civil rights post he resigned from the allmale garden city golf 
club to which he had belonged for 32 years during most of his 
years as a state senator a parttime post dunne lived in albany 
at the fort orange club which until 1988 barred women 
attorney general dick thornburgh who campaigned for dunnes 
nomination on thursday heaped praise on the former legislator 
as a state senator he has a long list of accomplishments in 
the civil rights field thornburgh said mentioning dunnes 
sponsorship of the first aids confidentiality legislation and a law 
restricting the use of age sex and marital status as insurance 
underwriting criteria 
he has devoted most of his professional life as a public 
servant dedicated to matters relating to the administration of 
justice including the rights of institutionalized persons and 
increased access by the public to legal services thornburgh said 
but benjamin hooks executive director of the national 
association for the advancement of colored people said 
actually i dont have enough information at this point to give 
an opinion we wait to see what this mans record is and we will be 
looking at it 
urvashi vaid executive director of the national gay and lesbian 
task force said her organization knew little about dunnes 
positions on homosexual rights 
he doesnt seem to have much of a record one way or the 
other vaid said from the administrations point of view no 
position on gay rights is probably better than a positive one 
colleen oconnor a spokeswoman for the american civil liberties 
union said the new york chapter had found dunnes record on civil 
rights to be lacking last year for example dunne opposed nyclu 
positions by voting to reinstate the death penalty require drug 
testing for parolees seize the assets of certain criminal 
suspects and eliminate medicaid funding for abortions 
dunne has bipartisan support at least in new york state 
new york gov mario cuomo a democrat sent a letter to bush 
earlier this month calling dunne an honorable and conscientious 
public servant an able lawyer dedicated to the rule of law a 
committed family man and a very decent person 
democratic rep charles rangel an old friend and the most 
powerful black member of new yorks congressional delegation also 
supports dunne who is white 
if the president has to pick a republican he couldnt pick a 
more decent person than john dunne rangel said in a recent 
interview 
the lucas nomination was scuttled by intensive lobbying by civil 
rights groups troubled by his lack of legal experience and his 
views that supreme court rulings had not eroded civil rights 
protections under the law 
dunne on wednesday said he had reviewed a videotape of the 
judiciary committees grilling of lucas to prepare for his own 
hearings 
i looked at that video again over the weekend and it was a 
very tough spot they put him in said dunne its an altogether 
different ballgame in washington gosh they play for keeps

congressional democrats and bigcity mayors 
are setting the stage for fresh feuding over the war against drugs 
saying president bushs plan to raise spending by 11 billion next 
year is inadequate 
were going to have to have a lot more resources and thats 
not in this document house narcotics committee chairman charles 
rangel dny told a news conference thursday after bush 
presented his plan 
the 106 billion package includes more money for a pentagon 
attack on cocaine traffickers and would allow the death penalty for 
drug kingpins it would boost the cost next year by 116 percent 
over the current 95 billion 
sen joseph r biden jr ddel on wednesday proposed a 
different version and debate over the rival strategies could 
easily carry over into the fall congressional campaigns 
bidens version calls for spending 146 billion next year 
including 400000 new beds in treatment centers and immediate 
treatment for pregnant addicts as well as more fbi and drug 
enforcement agents and prison expansion 
bush presented his plan in a white house speech to newspaper 
editors calling drugs this nations no 1 concern 
he said the senate most likely will shoot for a higher budget 
than what he is requesting but that we do sense a desire on the 
part of the congress to cooperate 
in terms of the objectives of this strategy were in pretty 
close accord with both democrats and republicans on the hill so i 
think we can get early action bush said 
biden in a breakfast speech to the national conference of 
mayors said he hoped to work with the administration to 
implement the proposals on which we agree and to narrow our 
differences on the rest 
biden said his strategy did not carry the endorsement of any 
democratic party group or even that of democrats on the judiciary 
committee 
a number of democratic mayors were quick to condemn the 
strategy we cant win the war on drugs with 106 billion 
philadelphias w wilson goode told reporters 
it is woefully inadequate said new york mayor david 
dinkins several of the mayors expressed support for bidens 
alternative 
on capitol hill republican lawmakers and democrats whose states 
stand to gain increased federal funds under the bush strategy 
expressed support 
sen phil gramm rtexas called it a logical extension of 
phase i of the program and scoffed at a biden complaint that it 
targets punishing casual users instead of hardcore addicts who 
commit most of the crimes 
theyre all criminals gramm said he said casual use has 
put a drug thug at the door of every junior high school in the 
country 
sen david pryor dark complained that one thing is 
especially lacking and that is any emphasis whatsoever on rural

some lawmakers are reacting cautiously to 
president bushs proposed 1 billion aid plan for panama with one 
senator saying congress wants to help the country but predicting a 
tough battle on how much to give 
thats a substantial amount of money for a tiny country 
said sen paul simon dill echoing questions that others also 
raised about the amount bush is proposing for the country he 
ordered the us military to invade on dec 20 
wheres it going to come from asked rep peter kostmayer 
dpa a member of the house foreign affairs subcommittee on 
western hemispheric affairs its too much 
deputy secretary of state lawrence eagleburger planned to 
provide additional details of the plan to senators today the day 
after bush unveiled it to spend the money the administration must 
submit a supplemental appropriation requiring congressional 
approval 
these programs will give as close to instant relief as we can 
expect here bush told reporters on thursday 
the package will include 500 million in humanitarian assistance 
for housing emergency public works business assistance loans and 
export opportunities some money would be used to rebuild houses 
destroyed in the military invasion 
another 500 million would go to balanceofpayment support 
public investment and economic restructuring in a country whose 
economy was tattered by manuel antonio noriegas corrupt regime 
noriega who surrendered to us troops is in jail in florida 
facing drugtrafficking charges 
bush said some of aid money would be siphoned away from other 
countries foreign aid programs but he and other administration 
officials did not give specifics 
simon said he had learned that 30 million would come from 
programs originally designed to help somalia and the sudan he said 
he would oppose redirecting the money 
if the aid is approved panama would become one of the largest 
recipients of us foreign assistance 
lawmakers generally say they are eager to do something for 
panama i applaud that effort said sen claiborne pell 
dri chairman of the foreign relations committee sen richard 
lugar rind agreed 
but several members peppered bernard aronson the deputy 
secretary of state for interamerican affairs with questions about 
panamas future 
sen christopher dodd dconn chairman of the senate foreign 
affairs subcommittee on the western hemisphere asked aronson what 
is being done to ensure that panamanians return the billions of 
dollars in capital that left the country during the noriega regime 
dodd said it would be more politically palatable for members to 
approve aid if the panamanians are committed to helping themselves 
its going to be a tough battle to get anything through 
congress said dodd noting foreign aid is traditionally 
unpopular particularly during tight budget years 
dodd also expressed concern that noriega associates would 
benefit my concern is that we are changing the name changing 
the uniform but they are still the same people he said 
sen jesse helms rnc a longtime opponent of foreign 
assistance suggested taking money the united states gives to the 
organization of american states and sending it to panama some 
latin countries criticized the us invasion of panama and helms 
said he was tired of helping countries that kick us in the teeth 
and cuss us out 
sen john kerry dmass urged the administration to press for 
reform of the panamanian banking system to prevent bankers from 
hiding or laundering money from drug deals 
aronson assured senators the usinstalled government of 
president guillermo endara is committed to revitalizing the country 
and making sure the old pdf panamanian defense force monster 
disappears 
he said the country needs help in part because of its external 
debt of roughly 4 billion and its unemployment rate of more than 
25 percent 
moreover he said the bush administration wants to work closely 
with congress to eliminate all sanctions against the country that 
were put in place in an attempt to drive noriega from office those 
sanctions resulted in a 20 percent loss in panamas gross national 
product he said 
meantime vice president dan quayle is scheduled to discuss the 
aid proposal in a meeting with endara this weekend during a visit 
to panama

there a surge in christian faith 
this is something new said the 71yearold evangelist

they are beginning to print thousands of bibles in the soviet 
union and in many places i understand that sunday schools are 
being opened which have been forbidden through all these years 
theyve had 70 years in which none of these things happened 
graham said the growing religious fervor in eastern europe was 
evident in july when 100000 packed a stadium in budapest hungary 
to hear him 
our largest crowds were in romania where we went from city to 
city he said some people feel this is a demonstration not 
only of the spiritual hunger but also the desire of the people for 
more freedom

president bush savoring a major triumph over 
congress is claiming a mandate to deal with china the way i feel 
is correct despite widespread opposition to his policies from 
democrats and republicans alike 
surprised you didnt it bush exclaimed thursday after the 
senate by a fourvote margin upheld his veto of a politically 
popular bill protecting chinese students from deportation 
bush said the victory would be helpful in reaching 
accommodation with the senate and house on other matters 
senators voted 6237 against bush but the vote failed to meet 
the twothirds margin needed for an override the house had voted 
39025 a day earlier against the president 
in part the issue was an electionyear test of strength between 
a republican president and a democratic congress however it was 
not a strictly partisan battle since 145 republicans in the house 
and eight in the senate joined with democrats in trying to override 
bush 
while bush emerged the winner the votes provided a clear 
measure of congressional displeasure with his secret diplomacy with 
beijing and his refusal to deal harshly following the crackdown 
against chinas prodemocracy forces 
sen william cohen rmaine said the bill represented 
americas symbol to the world that is struggling to throw off the 
chains of dictators 
sen slade gorton rwash said that letting the veto stand 
sends the signal that they can get away with what they have done 
and retain their power and i think thats wrong 
yet senate minority leader bob dole rkan said the showdown 
was the equivalent of throwing out the first ball of the 1990 
election season and was being used by democrats to force 
republicans to cast a tough political vote for the president 
bush said he regarded the outcome as a mandate for his policies 
it gives me the confidence that im going to go forward the 
way i think is correct here and were going to stay right on 
track bush said 
defending the secrecy of his approach bush said i think the 
decisions ive made are good decisions 
i can understand the controversy and i can understand why 
there isnt unanimous endorsement he said but i view it as a 
very good step 
bush said the 40000 chinese students in the united states would 
be fully protected even without the legislation no student as 
long as im president will be sent back against his or her will 
he vowed 
the presidents victory followed an intense white house lobbying 
blitz that included calls from bush as well as former president 
richard m nixon 
bush discussed the china situation as well as other subjects 
in a pair of news conference appearances thursday at which he also 
announced a 106 drugfighting strategy and a 1 billion aid 
package for panama to rebuild after the american invasion last 
month 
on a major foreign policy front bush praised mikhail s 
gorbachev as the best hope for the united states in the soviet 
union and declined to fault him for using force to restore order in 
the soviet republic of azerbaijan 
i think we have a lot at stake in continuing to deal with this 
man bush said i want very much for him to succeed 
on other subjects bush said 
he would not point a finger at any party for the impasse in 
middle east peace talks saying i dont think it would be 
helpful to quantify recalcitrance he said the united states 
would continue to be a catalyst to bring israel the 
palestinians and egypt together 
he disagreed with naacp leaders that there is a rising tide 
of racial violence in america although he said there have been 
some very ugly incidents with recent bombings and other actions 
he will tell americans in his state of the union address next 
wednesday that the country is going to be in pretty good shape 
he believes that members of congress favor military base 
cutbacks only if they dont affect their own regions i was 
guilty of the same thing when i was a member of congress bush 
said adding that a strong economy is the best answer for helping 
communities recover from base closings 
he plans to submit a list of proposed base shutdowns to congress 
on monday when he submits his fiscal 1991 budget

progressives from the lower ranks of the communist 
party are mounting an open challenge in the powerful central 
committee demanding a multiparty system and a virtual apology for 
decades of totalitarian rule 
for the first time in at least half a century the party may be 
facing two competing political platforms 
progressives newly united by a program and an organization they 
call the democratic platform hope to force discussion of their 
proposals at a meeting of the central committee feb 56 said 
mikhail v malyutin one of the groups leaders 
the politburo led by president mikhail s gorbachev wary of the 
fall of communist parties in eastern europe and stung by sharpening 
criticism of its own failure to solve economic and ethnic crises 
is proposing its own program to the meeting 
the politburo platform calls for radical democratization of 
the party according to a central committee staffer who spoke on 
condition of anonymity details are still secret he said 
the central committee meeting comes at a time when some 
candidates for local elections are calling openly for a multiparty 
system even gorbachev two weeks ago dropped his unconditional 
opposition 
in the baltics other parties are already legalized or 
tolerated lithuanian communists expect to lose complete control of 
their legislature in next months election and be forced into the 
first coalition government in the soviet union 
the soviet communist party lost about 160000 members in 
december when 80 percent of the lithuanian party split off to form 
an independent communist party thousands more were reported to 
have quit in azerbaijan this week in fury over soviet troops 
attempt to halt ethnic and nationalist violence 
the central committee staffer refused to reveal the decline in 
membership but said we want to stop this process we need to 
reform the party quickly 
the democratic platform adopted by the reformers last 
weekend is much more blunt 
if the healthy forces inside the communist party do not 
succeed in carrying out deeprooted democratic transformation the 
crisis inevitably will bring the party to political bankruptcy as 
in poland or to the iron fist as in china it said 
more than 100 soviet journalists covered the reformers meeting 
last weekend yet in a telling example of just how far they can go 
in reporting severe criticism of the party almost none have 
reported on it 
but radio moscow did saying it would be written down in the 
history of the soviet communist party as a day when an event of 
extraordinary importance took place 
a large group of communists formed a platform within the 
party and declared its intention to work towards democratizing the 
party ranks and introducing a multiparty political system the 
radio said 
the platform was adopted last weekend at a conference of 
delegates from more than 100 communist clubs representing 60000 
members from 78 cities also at the meeting were progressives from 
the interregional group of parliamentarians and reformers in the 
party bureaucracy itself such as vyacheslav n shostakovsky 
rector of the higher party school for communists 
the reform group is trying to gain an audience with gorbachev to 
win a formal place on the agenda for its platform and to seek the 
right to participate in the plenum said malyutin 
in any case moscow legislator boris yeltsin is a member of the 
central committee and he is expected to propose the platform 
many of the reformers have threatened to break away and form a 
social democratic party if their demands are not met but others 
argue that the communist party is still too powerful and the 
reformers must fight for control of it 
the democratic platform also calls for the party to recognize 
the enormous responsibility carried by the communist party for the 
results and consequences of the totalitarian regime in our 
country 
it furthers demands complete and irreversible condemnation of 
the model of government socialism which has brought our society to 
deep crisis 
it calls for a multiparty system supports more independence for 
the republics individual communist parties for each republic and 
the transfer of power from the party to elected parliaments and 
local councils 
it demands an end to the upper class of bureaucrats who enjoy 
special food apartments cars and other privileges and election 
of the delegates to the critically important party congress now 
scheduled for october 
in the past delegates have been approved by party leaders who 
thereby guaranteed their own hold on power 
it is the last item that is most likely to win approval from the 
central committee still largely the province of hardliners 
because they were chosen at the last congress in 1986 when 
gorbachev had not yet consolidated his position 
in fact the politburo platform also includes a new means of 
electing delegates to the party congress that will reflect the 
very radical feelings in the grassroots level said the central 
committee staffer he said he could not give details 
although much of the country still believes in oldfashioned 
communism those forces apparently suffered a defeat this week 
leningrad party chief boris gidaspov seen as a likely leader of 
a conservative counterattack against gorbachev withdrew his 
candidacy for the city council after a poll of voters ranked him 
9th on a list of 10 prominent figures local journalists said 
the official media also have been hinting at impending change 
the television news show vremya on sunday made an unusually 
strong attack on privilege by showing a luxurious hunting lodge 
frequented by highranking officials it contrasted this with the 
camps cramped employee housing which had no running water or 
central heat

vice president dan quayle departs today for 
latin america with a new mandate to carry details of president 
bushs 1 billion aid package to panama 
quayle will go emptyhanded however to another stop on his 
threeday trip jamaica where he likely will run into some 
testiness about a 25 million cut in us assistance 
he will make those two stops after traveling to honduras on 
saturday for the presidential inauguration there 
he also plans discussions with five other presidents attending 
the inauguration from belize guatemala honduras costa rica and 
venezuela 
bush is dispatching quayle to talk to those leaders about the 
widespread objections among the latins to the dec 20 us military 
invasion of panama 
quayle initially had hoped to visit some other countries but 
faced resistance from latin leaders simmering over the invasion 
quayle aides however insisted the heads of state had no problem 
with meeting with quayle outside their own capitals at the honduran 
event 
bush who earlier said he wanted quayle to explain that he did 
not undertake the invasion without a valid rationale said thursday 
he thinks many of those nations now understand that 
but he acknowledged there had been bruised feelings over what 
the latins saw as a violation of panamanian sovereignty 
anytime you undertake an engagement like i authorized youve 
got to assess what the downside is because there is a history 
bush told reporters apparently in reference to the 
heavyhandedness the united states has exhibited toward latin 
countries in years past 
bush on thursday announced a 1 billion aid package to help 
panama rebuild and revive its economy in the wake of the invasion 
damage estimates have ranged as high as 2 billion however 
bush said quayle would discuss details of the package with the 
usinstalled president of panama guillermo endara during a stop 
there on sunday endara said he had asked the united states for 2 
billion in aid 
administration officials said aid programs to other countries 
will have to be cut to fund much of the panama package they said 
bush has not decided which countries but one country apparently 
designated to suffer is jamaica 
jamaican officials have made it clear they are not happy that 
they are to lose 25 million in economic support funds one 
administration official said 
a jamaican diplomat said the money is part of the 116 million 
that was allocated in fiscal 1989 to jamaica for food aid economic 
support and development assistance the diplomat said jamaican 
officials have been informed the economic support used in the past 
for balance of payment support will be zeroed out 
jamaica is one of the countries that joined the overwhelming 
organization of american states vote deploring the us invasion

faced with a modest rise in stockpiles and 
sharply lower market prices soybean farmers will probably have 
second thoughts about boosting acreages significantly this year 
according to agriculture department analysts 
although the departments estimates of 1990 planting intentions 
are not due for release until march 20 a usda report said thursday 
market fundamentals suggest weaker incentives to plant soybeans 
will prevail 
this year like last the government will allow farmers to 
sign up to plant up to 25 percent of their program permitted 
acreage to soybeans without reducing their historical base the 
report said however relatively low soybean prices are likely to 
give scant encouragement to shifts from program crops such as 
corn to soybeans 
soybean prices in central illinois are averaging 560 per 
bushel this month down from 722 last summer the report said 
prices tumbled by about 90 cents a bushel between july and august 
when it was apparent the 1990 harvest would produce nearnormal 
yields 
the larger 1989 crop is meeting strong domestic demand for 
both soybean meal and oil but there is weaker export demand for 
soybean products the report said 
soybean meal is in demand as a highprotein feed ingredient for 
livestock and oil is used in a wide variety of food and industrial 
products 
according to usda projections the soybean stockpile at the 
start of the 199091 marketing year on sept 1 may be around 335 
million bushels nearly double the sixyear low of 182 million 
bushels last sept 1 
over the entire 198990 marketing year soybeans are projected 
to average in the range of 535 to 565 per bushel compared with 
735 last season 
the report said around 11 billion bushels of soybeans will be 
crushed into meal and oil by processors this year only slightly 
more than in the 198889 marketing year 
soybean exports are expected to rise to 580 million bushels in 
198990 from 527 million last year that would still be far less 
than the 802 million bushels exported in 198788 but export demand 
for meal and oil is expected to decline 
domestic demand for soybean meal is forecast at a record 214 
million tons this year in part because of high feeding margins 
particularly for hogs and poultry the report said 
furthermore it added soybean meal is extremely 
pricecompetitive with other protein sources prices have fallen 
below 200 a ton since summer and are expected to average 165 to 
185 in 198990 
meal exports are forecast at only 49 million tons this season 
down from 51 million tons last year the report said this is due 
to intense south american competition

an agriculture department scientist says the 
1989 corn crop probably escaped the high levels of contamination by 
aflatoxin a natural cancercausing chemical that plagued growers 
in 1988 
microbiologist donald t wicklow of the departments 
agricultural research service said the weather conditions necessary 
for unusually high aflatoxin levels generally were not present on a 
national scale last year he said none has been reported since last 
falls harvest 
wicklow works for the agencys northern regional research center 
in peoria ill his comments were released here thursday by the 
agency 
aflatoxin is a poisonous chemical produced by two soil fungi 
aspergillus flavus and a parasiticus wicklow said a flavus has 
been found most commonly in peanuts and corn especially in hot 
dry weather such as occurred in 1988 
the agency said aflatoxin has been linked to cancer in 
laboratory animals 
corn will not necessarily be contaminated simply because it was 
grown in a field that previously produced aflatoxintainted corn 
wicklow said corn will also not pick up aflatoxin from being 
stored in bins that previously held tainted corn 
wicklow said concerns about aflatoxin often focus on the 
southeast partly because of the regions typically hotter weather 
during the period when corn is maturing 
but he said statistics for 1988 show that of the four states 
north carolina south carolina georgia and florida only north 
carolina produced as much as 1 percent of the us corn crop with 
16 percent of the nations harvest of 493 billion bushels

president bush will propose 50 million in his 
new budget to improve government statistics that affect americans 
from their wages to their social security benefits the 
administrations chief economic adviser says 
saying the government now spends four or five hundred 
million dollars to gather economic statistics michael j boskin 
told reporters thursday the fiscal 1991 budget to be released on 
monday would contain a 10 percent increase for improvements in core 
national statistics 
boskin chairman of bushs council of economic advisers 
described the us statistical system as among the finest in the 
world but he admitted serious problems remain especially in 
those rapidly changing areas of the economy where accurate 
information is most urgently needed 
boskin heads a working group of the presidents economic policy 
council that already has submitted 25 recommendations for changes 
in various government statistics the agencies are expected to 
report in about three months how they expect to implement them 
the governments statistical gathering system is important 
because of its impact on the economy boskin said giving as 
examples such things as private orders and contracts 
costofliving adjustments the federal budget and monetary 
policy 
boskin a former stanford university economics professor said 
estimating changes in quality in many important sectors is the most 
serious problem 
when we as a nation produced mostly things like steel and 
wheat output was easy to count tons of steel and bushels of 
wheat he said 
today a larger share of output is in sectors where better 
performance means quality and improved convenience he continued 
consider the impact of 24hour automatic teller machines and the 
changes in desktop and laptop computers 
boskin cited price indexes that should adjust for quality change 
when the commerce department recently introduced a new 
computer price index that only partially adjusted for quality 
change it raised real gnp gross national product growth from 38 
to 41 percent a difference reaching 70 billion by 1988 and 
lowered the rate in inflation as measured by the gnp price 
deflator from 36 to 33 percent between 1982 and 1988 he said 
boskin also said the governments statistical system has not 
kept up with changes in the economy airline deregulation for 
instance produced lower fares and widespread discounting causing 
passenger miles to increase by over 60 percent in the 1980s he 
said 
yet the price index is still heavily based on fullfare 
tickets which now account for only 10 percent of tickets he 
noted 
and he added in some industries such as education and health 
care even defining the unit of output is difficult

public officials accused of corruption 
frequently hide behind a stone wall of silence but here theyve 
built barricades to keep reporters out 
its not every day though that a city parks commissioner is 
accused of deliberately polluting a lake 
buffalos parks department scandal has grown in two months from 
a relatively ordinary tale of accusations of kickbacks and 
purchasing irregularities to encompass the mayors broken lawnmower 
and melted ice in a favorite skating lake 
in the process it is threatening to bring the government of new 
yorks secondlargest city to a halt 
city council members want to talk to parks commissioner robert 
e delano about the allegations and also about the ordinary 
business of government 
but hes stonewalling them 
delano and mayor james d griffin could not be located for 
comment thursday delano has had no comment since the affair began 
griffins only response has been to lavishly praise delano his 
longtime friend and handball partner and to label complaining 
parks workers stool pigeons 
if the parks commissioner cant talk in public to the common 
council itll become almost impossible for us to manage the 
affairs of the city majority leader eugene fahey said we 
have to prepare a city budget but the prosecutor investigating 
the scandals said his entire probe could fall apart if the council 
subpoenas delano because the parks boss could win immunity from 
prosecution if he is compelled to talk to the council 
unfortunately city government finds itself at an impasse 
us attorney dennis c vacco wrote in a letter to fahey 
i respectfully suggest that the public interest in a thorough 
and orderly investigation into possible wrongdoing within the parks 
department would at this time outweigh the publics interest in the 
common councils efforts to perform its lawful role in the conduct 
of city government 
the scandal began with allegations in november about private 
work done by parks workers on city time various forms of 
favoritism and kickbacks and purchasing irregularities 
it exploded last week when news reports quoted unidentified 
parks workers as saying they had been ordered to pour brine into 
delaware park lake to keep it from freezing after the common 
council took a lakeside refreshment stand concession away from 
delanos associates brine is a saturated salt solution 
the melted ice struck a nerve because the lake the centerpiece 
of the frederick law olmsted park that officials call buffalos 
jewel had just been cleaned of pollution at a cost of 12 
million 
heres the guy whos supposed to protect our lakes and hes 
giving orders to his men to pollute it said councilman alfred t 
coppola whose district includes the park thats whats crazy 
about the whole thing 
when the council asked delano for an explanation on tuesday he 
refused to appear 
on the same day the 3foothigh wooden barricade went up at 
the entrance to delanos office suite one worker told the 
associated press that the barricade was erected because toxic 
chemicals were stored in the building but another told a 
television reporter that it was to keep you guys out 
griffin was linked to the scandal for the first time on thursday 
by unidentified parks workers who told the buffalo news that they 
had repaired the mayors lawnmower and boat engine on city time in 
a city shop using city materials 
more tips of alleged wrongdoing are coming in every day coppola 
said he showed reporters an anonymous letter he had received 
urging him to check the fence purchases against their work 
orders 
each day gets worse not only the citys image is at stake 
weve got a whole department in turmoil coppola said

sen richard bryan of nevada is urging 
president bush to withdraw his nominee to head the energy 
departments longdelayed search for a site to build the nations 
first highlevel nuclear waste dump 
bryan a democrat and a staunch opponent of the departments 
study of nevadas yucca mountain as a candidate for the waste dump 
said thursday that bushs nominee was blatantly biased against 
nevadas legal battle to stop the project 
the nomination of john w bartlett to be director of the 
departments office of civilian radioactive waste management was 
sent to congress on wednesday the department has been without a 
permanent waste czar for more than two years 
the justice department on thursday carried out energy secretary 
james d watkinss vow to sue nevada for refusing to issue 
environmental permits needed to pursue scientific studies at yucca 
mountain a desert site about 100 miles northwest of las vegas 
nevada sued watkins last month in federal court in san francisco 
seeking to force a halt to the project 
watkins said thursday he felt compelled to take legal action 
against nevada because the state has delayed action on the 
environmental permits for more than two years 
i have no alternative but to turn to the federal courts to 
break this logjam he said in a statement he noted that even if 
all obstacles to the project are removed and yucca mountain proves 
scientifically sound a waste dump could not open before 2010 it 
originally was to open in 1998 
bryan said bartlett is totally unqualified for this critical 
post bartlett said we need to throw out scientific research and 
base the decision to site a nuke dump on pure judgment bryan 
urged bush to begin a new search for a fair candidate 
no date for bartletts confirmation hearing has been set 
bartlett began working for the energy department as a consultant 
last nov 7 after leaving the analytic sciences corp an 
engineering contractor to several government agencies including 
the energy department bartlett worked there for 10 years and was 
manager of nuclear technology at an annual salary of 133806 when 
he quit according to financial disclosure records on file at the 
department 
bartlett and his company were paid consultants to the electric 
utility trade group edison electric institute and the industrys 
research arm the electric power research institute the financial 
records show 
the energy department said bartlett was not available for 
comment thursday 
craig varoga a spokesman for sen harry reid dnev said reid 
was unhappy with the bartlett nomination but had not decided 
whether to oppose his confirmation

youve seen top gun more than once 
you crave the thrill of streaking across the sky on the enemys 
tail targeting their fighter jet making the kill savoring the 
victory 
but youve never flown a plane 
welcome to air combat usa where for 495 anyone wouldbe red 
barons or combat veterans nostalgic for the past can take 
italianmade propeller aircraft up for dogfights over peacetime 
southern california 
it takes nothing but a desire to get into the airplane said 
greg sloan one of eight pilots who fly with air combat customers 
in the dualcontrol planes 
the 2yearold enterprise started by commercial airline pilot 
mike blackstone has pitted friend against friend son against 
father spouse against spouse 
weve had everything from high school students to 50th wedding 
anniversary husbandandwife air combat said blackstone in that 
encounter he said the woman shot him down over and over again 
the oneday fighter fantasy includes an hour of ground school 
an hour of flying and a debriefing theres also a keepsake a 
videotape of the adventure made by a cockpit camera 
customers take the adventure as far as courage and their 
instructor will allow they can perform a ballet of rolling 
scissors high and low yoyos lag rolls and loops in pursuit of 
their opponent 
the socalled kills simulated by a trail of smoke emitted 
by the victim aircraft are verified by a tracking system developed 
by blackstone an aeronautical engineer 
the invention was spurred by a friendly rivalry with pilot bill 
bancroft who helped him get the business going now arguments over 
whether a kill was good are settled electronically followed by 
triumphant shouts of yeeehaawww 
air combats three planes decked out in navy stripings or the 
markings of a gray russian mig fly out of fullerton airport 25 
miles south of downtown los angeles 
the missions take place over unpopulated areas outside of 
federal airways and above 1500 feet as required by federal 
aviation administration regulations blackstone said the planes 
remain 500 feet apart 
he doesnt dismiss questions about safety 
theres always danger its flying blackstone said this 
is southern california and theres a lot of airplanes but we fly 
only on good visibility days and maintain a vigil for other 
aircraft at all times when we spot one we stop the flight 
air combat has had no accidents he said 
sloan a 20year marine veteran who flew nearly 300 missions in 
vietnam said he isnt nervous about his novice charges ive 
been instructing air combat maneuvers since 1973 theres nothing 
they can do that i havent seen im having as much fun now as i 
did then 
the marchetti sf260 aircraft have a top cruising speed of 250 
mph 
the pilots can be surprised by human nature however the man 
who begs them to turn back right after takeoff or the woman who 
relishes every bit of gforce as she repeatedly bests a pilot with 
1500 hours of flight time 
business has boomed in the six months since blackstone installed 
his kill tracking system in air combats three planes sloan said 
the company has more than 700 bookings 
there are former fighter pilots from vietnam to world war ii 
coming out to relive their experiences sloan said weve had 
people fly in from scandinavia to tokyo 
the air combat pilots downplay the connection to the tom cruise 
movie top gun which focused on the miramar naval air stations 
fighter weapons school popularly known as top gun in san diego 
the draw we get is from the actual fact they can fly the 
airplane sloan said safety is the prime directive and fun 
next

lebanons defiant christian leader michel aoun 
is asking a us court to stop the united states from evicting his 
ambassador in washington 
aouns lawsuit against secretary of state james a baker iii and 
treasury secretary nicholas brady is being heard today by us 
district court judge harold greene 
the petition claims the us government plans to evict abdallah 
bouhabib who served as lebanons ambassador here until dec 11 
from the lebanese embassy and from his residence 
bouhabib who also is a plaintiff in the case was removed from 
his post by lebanons new government led by syrianbacked president 
elias hrawi the united states extended diplomatic recognition to 
bouhabibs successor named by the hrawi government 
however aoun does not recognize the hrawi government and has 
ordered bouhabib to refuse to relinquish his post bouhabib locked 
the embassy and has refused entry to the employees 
hrawi sent an envoy to washington 10 days ago to seek the state 
departments help the envoy empowered the state department to lift 
bouhabibs diplomatic immunity a source said speaking on 
condition of anonymity 
by lifting his immunity the state department would have cleared 
the way for bouhabibs eviction 
plaintiffs have learned from unofficial sources that the 
defendants presumably at the request of the current rival regime 
intend forcibly to enter the embassy premises and forcibly to 
eject mr bouhabib according to court papers filed in the case 
such a violation of the premises of a foreign mission would 
violate bedrock principles of international law and the rights of 
lebanon under the vienna convention on diplomatic security 
according to the petition 
but the government argues in the case that under the vienna 
convention it has a duty to protect the rights of the lebanese 
government which it recognizes 
hrawi was elected president by the lebanese parliament in 
november with the backing of the 22nation arab league aoun 
contends the election was not valid 
aoun who was named lebanons prime minister in 1988 has 
refused to relinquish his job and is holding out at the 
presidential palace in beirut with thousands of supporters 
the government of prime minister aoun controls a significant 
portion of lebanese territory including a population of 
approximately 1 million citizens the plaintiffs argued 
brady was cited in the suit because the treasury department 
oversees the secret service whose function it is to protect 
embassies

with the bush administration struggling to 
respond to the upheaval in the soviet bloc sovietologists are 
debating the identity of z the mysterious author of an article 
arguing that mikhail gorbachevs reforms are doomed 
the speculation this week centers on martin malia a 
littleknown intellectual historian at the university of california 
at berkeley said harley balzer director of the russian area 
studies program at georgetown university 
the controversial article which appeared in daedalus published 
by the american academy of arts and sciences recalled one written 
at the dawn of the cold war by a senior administration official 
outlining the policy of containment that guided us policy toward 
moscow for the next three decades 
george kennan who at the time was head of policy planning at 
the state department published the earlier pseudonymous article in 
the influential magazine foreign affairs but his identity was 
soon discovered 
the new z article said gorbachev was pursuing only halfway 
measures that would not reform the soviet union which labors under 
the twin burdens of centuries of russian authoritarianism and 70 
years of communist totalitarianism 
such pessimism flies in the face of the official optimism 
expressed thursday by president bush 
i want very much for him to succeed bush said calling 
gorbachev the best hope for the united states in the soviet 
union 
earlier guesses at the identity of z included zbigniew 
brzezinski and henry kissinger the foreign policy gurus of 
previous administrations robert gates the former no 2 cia chief 
who works at the white house and retired lt gen william odom 
former head of the supersecret national security agency 
all four men hold doctorates in soviet studies or related fields 
and have expressed doubt over gorbachevs prospects of success 
all four either have denied authorship or refused to comment 
and scholars who have scrutinized the text say it does not reflect 
the style of any of the most prominent candidates 
stephen r graubard editor of daedalus refused to comment on 
the identity of the author saying he agreed to keep it secret 
for compelling reasons 
the mystery has heightened interest in daedalus which devoted 
the entire winter issue to the turmoil in eastern europe 
malia a specialist on 19th century russian intellectual 
history could not be reached through the day thursday at his home 
or office and he was quoted in the financial times of london as 
denying authorship 
a colleague of malias at berkeley historian nicholas 
riasanovsky said he doubted malia was the author adding 
professor malia has a distinctive and distinguished style but 
this is not it 
malias previous work includes a book on aleksandr hertzen a 
19th century russian intellectual credited with inspiring 
generations of revolutionaries 
balzer of georgetown said malia is known only to historians 
like myself 
a wellplaced administration source and expert in soviet affairs 
said malia is a good guess 
no one in the us government i know could write that said 
the source speaking on condition of anonymity 
its too scholarly no one in government would write it 
because the mindset is that of an historian or someone trying to 
analyze the problem from a distance and not trying to propose a 
solution the way someone in government would he said 
the article says that it is clear that 1989 will enter history 
as the beginning of communisms terminal crisis and not just in 
russia but from the baltic to the china sea and from berlin to 
beijing 
it is also clear that perestroika and glasnost welcome in 
their intention have in their application only aggravated the 
systemic crisis they were intended to alleviate they have done so 
because like all forms of soft communism they go against the 
logic of the system they are trying to save it said 
mikhail gorbachev has been trying to promote soft communism 
through structures and a population programmed for hard communism 
but the latter is the only variety of sovietism that is the genuine 
article for the essence of all varieties of sovietism is party 
supremacy thus the instrument of mr gorbachevs reform the 
party is the basic cause of sovietisms troubles it said

a majority of americans favor a federal 
longterm program that would cover the high costs of nursing home 
care through a plan similar to social security according to a 
private study released today 
the study commissioned by the american association of retired 
persons found a majority of people of all ages would be willing to 
pay 50 a month for a longterm care package that offers nursing 
home protection for all americans 
the report was prepared by the daniel yankelovich group research 
company based on a survey of 1490 americans ages 18 and older 
those surveyed identified coverage of nursing home costs as the 
most important part of any longterm care package with home care 
benefits seen as less important 
sixtyseven percent of those surveyed expressed strong support 
for a federal program with the level of support fairly consistent 
among different age groups in the sample 
the study also found a need for more public education about 
longterm care thirtythree percent of older americans incorrectly 
thought longterm care costs were covered by medicare which pays 
for less than 2 percent of the nations nursing home expenditures 
nursing home costs average more than 20000 a year with 
roughly half paid for directly by individuals and the other half by 
the government mainly through medicaid the welfare program for 
the poor 
medicaid coverage of nursing home costs is available once people 
exhaust most of their private resources with eligibility standards 
varying from state to state the fledgling market for private 
nursing longterm care insurance has grown in recent years with 
about 13 million policies sold by mid1989

a flu epidemic has hit the united states with 
outbreaks reported this winter just about everywhere a centers 
for disease control researcher said 
a key indicator a deathsfromflu index is at its highest 
level in at least eight years cdc researchers said thursday 
flu is reported widespread in 18 states and regional 
outbreaks are reported in 17 more states the cdc said in its 
weekly report 
last week 76 percent of 15090 deaths reported to the cdc from 
121 major cities were blamed on flu or pneumonia 
that significantly exceeds expected levels for the second 
straight week said dr walter gunn a cdc viral disease specialist 
this qualifies in our definition as an epidemic gunn said 
the cdcs epidemic level is 67 percent the 76 percent figure 
is the worst since the winter of 198182 gunn said 
most of the flu samples reported to the cdc this winter have 
been the type which researchers call ah3n2 that was the 
predominant type in the 198485 flu season when an estimated 
57000 americans died from flu 37000 more than in the typical 
winter gunn said 
as far as how many people will die this flu season that 
depends on how long this peak is sustained gunn said with any 
luck it will come right back down 
flu has been reported this winter just about everywhere 
gunn said 
the serious flu season he said points to the importance of flu 
vaccinations for those at greatest risk of serious complications 
from flu including older people and patients with heart or lung 
disease 
theres still time he said it only takes two weeks to 
build up your immunity 
gunn also stressed that parents whose children or teenagers 
have flu symptoms should be careful not to treat them with aspirin 
which has been linked in flu cases to reyes syndrome a rare but 
potentially deadly disease

a new report showing an upsurge in television 
violence on kids shows could give a boost to a congressional move 
to curb violent programming say the bills sponsors 
childrens weekend daytime programs contained more than 25 acts 
of violence per hour in each of the last three seasons many of 
them set in a humorous context said the study by university of 
pennsylvania and university of delaware researchers released 
thursday 
sen paul simon dill a sponsor of legislation limit the 
television violence joined rep dan glickman rkan to release 
the study and say it shows how important the bill is 
the bill to grant an antitrust exemption to the tv industry to 
address the issue is mired in a housesenate committee 
several network officials have said the bill is not necessary 
the bill contains no sanctions but would reflect a clear message 
from congress that were dissatisfied simon said at a press 
conference 
simon who first introduced the legislation five years ago said 
the report could help boost prospects for final congressional 
action he first introduced the measure five years ago 
the study traced the rise of kids tv violence to broadcast 
deregulation of the early 1980s 
the most significant difference seems to be the dismantling of 
codes pertaining to violence during childrens programming the 
study said it said the rate for violent acts during weekend 
daytime childrens programs was 186 per hour before 1980 and 264 
acts per hour after 1980 
violence essentially demonstrates who can dominate or 
terrorize whom and humor is the sugar coating on the pill said 
george gerbner a professor at the university of pennsylvanias 
annenberg school for communication and an author of the study 
the study tracked tv violence occurring in a realistic or 
humorous context but does not count verbal abuse it said exposure 
cultivates a sense of relative insecurity vulnerability and 
mistrust 
violence on prime time seems to have stabilized gerbner said 
about half of all major characters are involved in violence and 10 
percent in killing as they have been since the first violence 
profile was prepared at the annenberg school in 1967 he said 
there were 59 violent acts per prime time hour in 1967 compared 
with 62 in 1988 
the study addressed the three major networks cable television 
was not included 
the house voted in august to give television networks local 
stations producers and the cable tv industry a threeyear 
antitrust exemption to formulate guidelines for depicting nonnews 
violence on television currently such discussions would violate 
the sherman antitrust act 
the senate version of the bill was approved last may with an 
amendment by sen jesse helms rnc that would also allow the tv 
industry to discuss ways to curb scenes that glorify drug use and 
portray sexually explicit material 
a housesenate conference committee has yet to begin working on 
the final bill 
the helms amendment is a sticking point my hope is we can get 
a compromise simon said he said the industrywide guidelines 
made possible by the bill can begin at least to reverse the trend 
toward violence

offers of donations poured in after the family of 
carol stuart announced a scholarship fund in her memory to aid 
residents of the innercity neighborhood where she was fatally shot 
giusto and evelyn dimaiti announced the fund thursday in their 
first appearance before reporters since they learned that their 
soninlaw apparently plotted their daughters slaying 
the dimaiti family said they want their daughter to be 
remembered as more than just the victim of a sensational killing 
they also said they hope to begin a healing process in the mission 
hill neighborhood where she was fatally shot oct 23 in an 
elaborate hoax 
more than 40 people telephoned the familys lawyer immediately 
after the televised news conference offering to donate money to 
the carol dimaiti stuart foundation inc 
giusto dimaiti 64 who stood up to read a brief statement to 
reporters choked up during the end of his remarks 
she was truly the brightest of lights in our lives said 
dimaiti who was flanked by his 62yearold wife and 37yearold 
son carl she will always and forever be with us mere words 
cannot express the emptiness we feel or how much we miss her now 
and will miss her for the rest of our lives 
mrs dimaiti who dabbed at her eyes throughout the news 
conference and carl dimaiti did not comment 
the scholarship fund has been established for residents of 
mission hill the area where a manhunt was launched after charles 
stuart told police that a black mugger had shot him and his wife 
the case drew wide attention and the badly wounded stuarts 
dramatic call for help on his car telephone was broadcast 
nationally his wife died hours later their son lived just 17 days 
after being delivered by caesarean section ten weeks after the 
shootings stuart apparently committed suicide after one of his 
brothers implicated him in the shootings 
in announcing the scholarship attorney marvin geller recalled 
the old scars of racial tension opened by the hoax 
the dimaiti family believes that carol would not have wanted 
her death to be remembered as the cause of such divisiveness he 
said 
black community leaders in boston applauded the announcement but 
tempered their remarks with lingering concerns about the damage 
done mission hills residents 
i think its a magnanimous gesture on their part said louis 
elisa president of the boston chapter of the national association 
for the advancement of colored people given what they had to 
suffer from the cruel hoax without proper protection from the 
city maybe they can prevail on the mayor to make an apology so the 
real healing can start 
in a less conciliatory development black state legislators 
announced a bill thursday that would establish a special commission 
to investigate police work in the case 
the commission which would have limited subpoena power would 
examine how police built a case against william bennett a black 
man who has since been exonerated the panel also would try to 
determine where the media got information about bennett

barbara bush saying the white house holds a 
special place in the hearts of americans is asking them to find 
25 million in their pocketbooks for the executive mansion 
mrs bush on thursday announced the start of a private 
fundraising drive to raise an endowment for the famed public rooms 
of the mansion where every american president except george 
washington has lived 
the goal is to raise the money over the next three years to 
provide for future refurbishing and improvements of the state 
dining room east room blue room and other salons that draw tens 
of thousands of visitors each year 
the first lady said there is nothing crying out for repair or 
replacement right now but a 25 million endowment would help ensure 
for all time the best care and upkeep of all the splendid 
public rooms 
former first lady nancy reagan refurbished the family quarters 
of the white house with privately raised moneys and helped win 
accredited museum status for the public rooms of the mansion the 
endowment would only go for the upkeep of those public rooms 
the money will be raised by a new white house endowment fund an 
offshoot of the white house historical association founded during 
the kennedy era spearheading the drive will be an old friend of 
the bushes from midland texas dorothy m craig 
some of my friends at home think im going to redecorate the 
white house that is not the case she told reporters im 
simply a fundraiser 
we are starting from scratch said mrs craig a 
professional volunteer whose husband earle m craig jr is a 
retired oilman 
ms bush announcing the membership of the new endowment fund 
called the announcement of the fundraising drive cause for a 
celebration for this splendid house 
throughout our history the white house has always held a 
special place in the hearts of americans even those 19th century 
miscreants who cut little pieces of the curtains as souvenirs 
mrs bush said 
the drive was announced in the state dining room with several 
dozen members of the historical association the new endowment fund 
and an existing committee for the preservation of the white house 
on hand including former kennedy and johnson administration 
cabinet member clark clifford 
as clark clifford told me jackie kennedy said the white house 
should be the first house in the land and thats what were hoping 
to keep it mrs bush told reporters 
the move comes 12 years after an attempt during the carter 
administration to raise a 20 million preservation fund failed 
over the years money has been raised privately from benefactors 
to buy furniture paintings and other items for the executive 
mansion just this week the white house announced installation of a 
new rug drapes and other furnishings in the oval office at a cost 
of 62000 
mrs craig has participated in past preservation efforts at the 
white house and helped raise about 200000 for refurbishing of 
the vice presidential mansion when the bushes lived there she also 
played a role in raising funds for the new oval office rug

agreement is nearly unanimous that goals 
should be set on what students should know during their school 
years but officials say there are numerous problems in developing 
standards that cut across the entire nation 
mike cohen education director of the national governors 
association told a public forum thursday the governors are 
frustrated on several issues as they put together national 
education goals 
a couple of issues weve been wrestling with deal with the 
conception of national standards said cohen explaining the 
governors havent decided whether to set fixed standards nationally 
or set various targets for student performance 
cohen said targets could be set for example for top performing 
students average students and lowachieving students with the idea 
of moving more people forward 
another issue is how to set national goals that will complement 
statewide and local standards 
we want to set goals in such a way that they give every 
state and city an opportunity to be successful how you do that is 
not entirely clear he said 
recent gallup polls indicate most americans want national 
standards national tests and a national curriculum 
cohen spoke to the governing board of the national assessment of 
educational progress a federal testing program that periodically 
samples what american children know popularly known as the 
nations report card 
the congressionally mandated board decided in december to 
establish national tests graded on standards of what children 
should know by grades four eight and 12 the gradelevel goals 
will represent solid academic performance not minimum skills 
the panel agreed 
the panel approved a recommendation for single standards for the 
fourth and eighth grades and that two standards be used for the 
final year of high school one measuring satisfactory performance 
goals and another for goals tied to collegelevel courses 
panel chairman chester finn said the boards efforts would 
complement the president and governors national goals slated to be 
approved at the ngas february meeting 
these goals by no means span the whole curriculum said 
finn they certainly do not prescribe how major subjects should 
be taught indeed by setting outcome goals rather than detailed 
procedures for teaching we wish to encourage the initiative of 
schools and teachers of local school boards and state in devising 
different means to reach common ends 
several people including american federation of teachers 
president albert shanker urged the board to move slowly in setting 
the goals 
were so close it would be a damn shame if we dont do it 
right said shanker

advances to the woman reported to have helped the fbi lure him into 
a cocaine trap law enforcement sources say 
barry whom the fbi says it videotaped buying and smoking crack 
cocaine repeatedly asked rasheeda moore to make love during the 
visit last week to her hotel room that ended in his arrest on a 
misdemeanor drug possession charge the sources said thursday 
barry kissed and touched rasheeda moore but the former model 
rebuffed his advances said the sources who spoke on condition of 
anonymity 
fbi agents used a surveillance camera to watch barry purchase 
crack cocaine and smoke the illegal drug during the 45minute visit 
to ms moores hotel room on jan 18 according to an affidavit 
filed in the case 
ms moores refusal to have sex with the mayor was in accordance 
with instructions she received before the undercover sting began 
sources said 
she also was told to let the mayor suggest any drug use to avoid 
a defense claim he was entrapped ms moore was told not to use 
drugs the sources said 
barry who this week checked into a florida drug rehabilitation 
clinic after turning over his mayoral duties to the city 
administrator conducted city business on the telephone in ms 
moores room said one source

ms moore 38 has since told investigators about using cocaine 
with barry an account that conflicts with the mayors sworn denial 
to a federal grand jury last year of allegations he used illegal

charles lewis who has testified that he sold crack cocaine to the 
mayor and smoked it with him sources said

told investigators she was present when he and the mayor used drugs 
during a march 1988 weekend in the virgin islands sources said 
lewis identified ms moore in a photograph after he began 
cooperating with the investigation one source said 
prosecutors are trying to piece together a perjury case against 
barry according to law enforcement sources 
the grand jury has called additional witnesses including four 
members of the mayors aroundtheclock security detail said law 
enforcement and city government sources 
the investigation includes possible obstruction of justice by 
police assigned to guard the mayor one source said

federal reserve chairman alan greenspan 
acknowledges foreigners are not paying the full taxes owed on their 
us investments but hes cautioning congress not to tinker with 
the law 
its a tricky tradeoff to the extent it would divert to 
other countries foreign money financing both the us 
governments budget deficit and private investment greenspan told 
the taxwriting house ways and means committee on thursday 
until the united states became dependent on foreign investment 
in the early 1980s the government withheld a portion of the taxes 
owed on interest payments to foreigners on their us bank 
deposits treasury securities and private bonds and notes 
greenspan admitted there is a dilemma in trying to collect 
taxes from foreigners without driving their investments elsewhere 
however he nodded agreement when asked by rep jim moody 
dwis if a study was needed to measure the sensitivity 
foreign investors would have to various possible withholding rates 
that prompted the bush administration to issue a statement 
through the treasury department saying it opposes any attempt to 
remove the exemption on withholding taxes for foreign investors 
the congressional joint commission on taxation has estimated 
that just a 5 percent withholding tax on portfolio interest to 
foreigners would raise 300 million a year in new revenues 
were so dependent on the torrential flow from abroad that we 
cant even consider withholding a third of a billion dollars in 
duly owed taxes because were afraid the tax dodgers will roll 
their money someplace else moody said 
greenspan said the united states remains heavily dependent on an 
inflow of savings from abroad to finance both the gaping 
budget deficit and growing private investment in the face of a 
declining private savings rate 
if we did not have that foreign investment we would be 
looking toward a significant slowing and perhaps a stagnation of 
living standards he added 
however he acknowledged the dependence is putting substantial 
upward pressure on us interest rates particularly when rates 
in other countries rise as they have in japan and west germany in 
recent days 
the united states has become more vulnerable to disturbances 
originating outside its borders greenspan said but he said any 
effort to insulate the country from what he called an 
increasing globalization of capital markets could be very costly 
to our standard of living 
several members of the committee expressed fears the recent 
surge in interest rates abroad could trigger a recession or 
depression whats the flash point that might worry you the 
most asked rep sander levin dmich 
i dont even dare answer a question like that the fed 
chairman replied we worry about everything

us health researchers say the nations tetanus 
rate has dropped 20fold in four decades to the point where the 
disease now strikes only about 50 americans a year 
fiftythree tetanus cases were reported in 1988 five more than 
in 1987 the centers for disease control reported thursday the 
unofficial total for 1989 was 47 cases 
the nations tetanus rate 39 cases per million people when 
tetanus records began in 1947 was 2 per million by 1988 the cdc 
said the decline in tetanus has resulted from the widespread use 
of tetanus toxoid since the mid1940s coupled with improved 
techniques for treating wounds cdc researchers said 
most cases occur when tetanus bacteria enter the body through an 
unclean wound 
in the united states tetanus is primarily a disease of older 
adults the cdc said detailed information was available on 99 of 
the 101 cases reported in 198788 67 of those patients were 50 or 
older 
tetanus immunization efforts should be especially emphasized 
for people 50 and over the cdc said 
the cdc said tetanus vaccine is highly effective if given 
according to the recommended schedule three doses in the primary 
series usually given to children and booster shots every 10 years 
five of the 99 patients studied in 198788 had received primary 
tetanus shots two had received their latest doses more than five 
years before they became ill one had his last dose more than 20 
years earlier and for the other two it was unknown when their 
last dose was 
only an extremely small number of vaccine failures occur 
said dr peter strebel a cdc immunization specialist otherwise 
the disease is considered preventable

a republican congressman is warning house 
members to brace themselves for the unenviable task of voting on 
the expulsion of barney frank and buz lukens 
rep william dannemeyer of california said he plans to force an 
ontherecord expulsion vote if rep donald lukens rohio loses 
his appeal of a sexrelated conviction and plans to seek an 
expulsion vote on frank if the house ethics committee recommends 
lesser action against the massachusetts democrat 
frank an acknowledged homosexual is being investigated because 
of allegations he knew about a prostitution business being run from 
his home and that he engaged in sexual activity in the house 
gymnasium 
all members should expect a vote on expulsion of mr frank and 
mr lukens at any time dannemeyer said in a letter sent to 
fellow house members a recorded vote on expulsion in one form 
or another will occur members should be prepared 
frank spokesman doug cahn said the dannemeyer letter was 
simply a recast of what he said last fall 
barney is confident to leave this matter in the hands of the 
house ethics committee he said 
william jarrell lukens chief of staff said no comment 
dannemeyers press secretary paul mero provided a copy of the 
letter on request thursday but said the congressman did not wish to 
discuss it were pretty much just waiting for the ethics 
committee report to come out he said 
the 10th ohio district court of appeals is considering the case 
of lukens who was convicted in may of a misdemeanor contributing 
to the unruliness of a minor for having sex with a 16yearold 
girl he has been sentenced to 30 days in jail and a 500 fine but 
is free on bond 
the girl had charged that lukens knew she was underage when he 
paid her to have sex at his columbus apartment in 1988 
lukens who did not testify at the trial denied the 
allegations but after his conviction fellow republican members of 
congress and the ohio republican party said he should resign when 
he ignored that advice the chairmen of the republican party 
organizations in his district said lukens would be officially 
shunned if he showed up at any gop gathering 
at the request of house republicans the house ethics committee 
opened an investigation into whether lukens violated any house 
rules 
the investigation of frank was triggered by allegations by 
steven gobie a male prostitute whom frank admitted paying 80 for 
sex in 1985 frank also has admitted hiring gobie with personal 
funds to work as his housekeeper and driver but said he fired 
gobie when he learned his apartment was being used for the 
sexforhire business 
the ethics committee may choose from several options in 
addressing these members including not to do anything at all 
dannemeyers letter said after the committee has reported to the 
house on the case of mr frank i will offer a resolution of 
expulsion if the committee recommendation fails to do so i will do 
the same if mr lukens appeal fails 
in his letter dannemeyer didnt specify how he planned to force 
an ontherecord vote but listed a few options 
the vote may come in the form of an appeal of the chair a 
motion to table or on the actual question but the vote will 
occur he wrote those who will remember back only a year ago 
will remember how a motion to adjourn was used as a vote on the pay 
raise anything goes

welcome home soviet ambassador yuri 
dubinin shouted over a champagne toast and conductor mstislav 
rostropovich responded with bear hugs and kisses as he prepared to 
return to his homeland after 16 years of exile in the west 
the emotional exchange took place thursday night at a bon voyage 
party at the john f kennedy center for the performing arts 
honoring rostropovich and members of the national symphony 
orchestra who leave monday on a threeweek tour of japan and the 
soviet union 
as guests sipped russian vodka and nibbled on beluga caviar 
rostropovich said the dismantling of the berlin wall was a symbol 
of a new era for our life uniting his old family in the east 
with his new family in the west 
he said his greatest joy was to see one family on this 
planet 
rostropovich and his wife soprano galina vishnevskaya fled the 
soviet union in 1974 because of government harassment and curbs on 
their artistic freedom soviet authorities announced last week that 
they had restored the citizenship stripped from rostropovich and 
his wife in 1978 the year after he was appointed music director of 
the national symphony 
rostropovich said thursday night i am so excited i am so 
emotional at the prospect of returning home with music that 
bridges east and west with the language of friendship 
capitalism communism its all garbage rostropovich 
declared 
dubinin toasting the exiled conductor with champagne said 
rostropovichs fourday concert tour of moscow and leningrad with 
the orchestra in midfebruary was a sign of new times and proof 
that dreams come true 
the ambassador said the tour will be an exceptional 
manifestation of soviet chairman mikhail s gorbachevs policy 
of perestroika the new political thinking and new relations 
between the soviet union and the united states 
welcome to the soviet union he shouted turning to 
rostropovich he added welcome home the two then embraced for 
a long moment and turned to kiss their wives 
rostropovich said earlier this week that the restoration of his 
citizenship would not persuade him to abandon his new life in the 
west and return permanently to the soviet union 
but one result of the soviet governments action was to prompt 
his wife galina to drop her earlier objections and consent to 
accompany her husband on the tour the couples daughter olga who 
lives in new york also will make the trip 
orchestra officials disclosed thursday night that rostropovich 
will take about 600000 disposable medical syringes with him as a 
gift to the soviet people who reportedly are threatened by an aids 
epidemic in siberia 
the officials said the conductor is paying for the syringes 
which are in short supply in the soviet union out of his personal 
concert fees the purchase was arranged by industrialist armand 
hammer who donated 100000 to underwrite the costs of the 
orchestras tour 
hammer 91 said he will be in the audience when rostropovich 
conducts the orchestras first concert on feb 13 in the bolshoi 
hall of the moscow conservatory on the program for that concert 
will be tchaikovskys 6th pathetique symphony the last piece 
that rostropovich conducted and on the same stage before he 
sought exile in the west

chinese students said they feared being shipped 
back to their homeland after the senate upheld president bushs 
veto of a bill protecting them from deportation when their visas 
expire 
many students fear they will be sent back im scared for all 
my friends said yuan liu 30 a chinese student enrolled at 
brandeis university 
i think its a sad day for us said pei min xin 33 a 
doctoral student at harvard university who led the prodemocracy 
protests in beijing last spring im afraid that the president 
will continue his policy of accommodating the chinese dictators 
bush said the bill to eliminate that requirement was unnecessary 
because he has signed an administrative order allowing chinese 
students to stay in the united states 
the president said the legislation could have damaged us 
relations with china which has condemned the action and threatened 
to curtail exchange programs if it becomes law 
the senate voted 6237 thursday to override the presidential 
veto four votes short of the twothirds necessary the house voted 
overwhelmingly wednesday to reject bushs veto 
xiaxia gong 33 a harvard graduate student was among several 
chinese students gathered at the china information center in newton 
who said the failed legislation would have given them a sense of 
security 
many of the students fled to the united states after the chinese 
government cracked down on the protests in tiananmen square under 
the visas requirements bearers must return to china when their 
visas expire and live there for two years before they can apply for 
a new one 
the students fear that the presidents order could be reversed 
someday leaving them vulnerable to deportation to their homeland 
where they might be jailed 
i dont believe mr bush gong said how can we believe 
someone who has already cheated and sent highlevel officials to 
china when he said he would not we dont want our destiny put in 
someone elses hands 
in salem ore chinese students at oregon state university said 
they couldnt understand the senate vote 
it did send a message to china but it did not stand for human 
rights wang de qian covice president of the universitys 
chinese student association 
shu ouang said the student association did not want to 
override the president but the veto we want to send a stronger 
message to the chinese butchers

the dollar closed lower against the japanese yen 
friday while the key index on the tokyo stock exchange declined 
moderately 
the dollar finished the week at 14397 yen down 133 yen from 
thursdays close of 14530 yen it opened at 14365 yen and ranged 
between 1435014425 yen 
the nikkei stock average of 225 selected issues which posted a 
19013point gain thursday shed 9504 points or 025 percent 
closing the week at 3687407 
currency dealers said the dollars weakness reflected its sharp 
decline overnight in new york 
a report that us federal reserve board chairman alan greenspan 
had expressed cautious interest in reinstating a withholding 
tax on foreign investors in the united states helped knock the 
dollar lower in new york such a move would slow foreign 
investment which has been an important stimulus for recent us 
economic growth analysts say 
the report notwithstanding greenspan in fact cautioned a 
congressional committee thursday against placing any new 
impediments on foreign investment 
the impact of the fed chairmans reported remark lingered in 
the market said masaaki shikada a dealer with fuji bank 
shikada also attributed the dollars decline against the yen to 
local news reports that japans longterm prime rate is likely to 
be raised by 07 percentage point to 75 percent on feb 1 
a banking source who spoke anonymously said some japanese 
longterm banks including the longterm credit bank of japan will 
announce their rate hike later in the day 
the prime rate is a preferential rate of interest charged by 
commercial banks on loans to their most creditworthy customers 
on the stock exchange the nikkei index started higher in a 
favorable reaction to the yens strength against the dollar and 
higher bond prices but later turned weak securities dealers said 
after a round of buying orders the index lost steam as many 
market participants retreated to the sidelines due to uncertainty 
about the outcome of a major national election here slated for feb 
18 said a nomura securities analyst who spoke anonymously

i happened to 
see a plane going very low said another witness david johnson 
at the altitude it was at i really could not hear any engines so 
i am assuming the engines had conked out but there really was no 
fire or anything 
the crash occurred on a narrow peninsula jutting into oyster 
bay just south of the sagamore hill national historic site home 
of president theodore roosevelt it is an isolated wooded area of 
expensive homes 
nick fisher a cameraman for wcbstv said there were maybe 
hundreds of rescue workers and volunteers caring for the injured 
the plane is laying on an incline in a wooded area adjacent to 
a house fisher said 
the new york city emergency medical service asked for help by 
nassau county police sent five ambulances and a mobile emergency 
room vehicle to the crash scene an ems spokesman said 
according to radio colombiana flight 52 left bogota with a 
stopover in medellin the city known for its notorious cocaine 
cartel en route to new york 
the control tower at bogotas el dorado international airport 
said the avianca airliner left bogota at 130 pm est arrived at 
medellin 202 pm then left medellin at 530 pm and was 
scheduled to land in new york at 10 pm est 
a spokeswoman for avianca at el dorado said the company would 
have no immediate information or statement alan morrison a 
spokesman for the port authority said the airline had informed 
officials that there was no passenger list for the flight 
at kennedy officials were attempting to compile a list by 
interviewing families and friends of the passengers they were 
taken to firstclass lounge room at the pan american airways 
terminal where the avianca hangar is located 
one anxious relative john bedoia 30 of queens said he had 
gone to the airport to meet his brother guillermo bedoia 28 and 
sisterinlaw magnolia 26 
a worker told me the plane was not landing because of the 
weather he said when i went home i saw the news i came back 
to see whats happening but they wont tell me anything 
people are worried and crying and calling their relatives 
said leonora valencia 28 of queens who had gone with her son to 
meet her cousin maria maraugenin 41 
boeing officials in seattle said the avianca plane was 23 years 
old having been first delivered to pan am in january 1967 and 
transferred to avianca in february 1977 avianca owns two 707s 
they said 
according to janes all the worlds aircraft boeing produced 
the 707 model jetliner for commercial use from 1955 until 1982 
last nov 27 an avianca boeing 727 was bombed out of the sky 
minutes after takeoff from bogota on a domestic flight to cali the 
explosion killed all 107 people on board 
the extraditables group made up of drug traffickers fearing 
extradition to the united states claimed responsibility for the 
bombing in a phone call to the colombian radio network caracol 
matt murphy the duty agent at the federal drug enforcement 
administration office in new york said the dea did not know of any 
threats to the plane and had not received any general threats 
against colombian airliners recently 
i dont see it as being any drug cartels involved at this 
time he said if we find out later you never know but at this 
time theres no indication of that 
murphy also noted that the plane was close to its destination 
when it crashed which he said was an indication that sabotage was 
not involved 
in washington a spokesman for the national transportation 
safety board ted lopatkiewicz said the agency would be sending

anxious friends and relatives fretted 
over scant news at kennedy international airport while rescue 
workers struggled on long islands heavily wooded north shore to 
find survivors of avianca flight 52 
local television showed pictures of dazed survivors being pulled 
from the wreckage some bloodied some people appeared to be 
trapped in the twisted metal and some lay motionless others 
including several children were carried away crying by rescuers 
amanda pinzon 27 of elizabeth nj who was waiting at 
kennedy with relatives who had come to meet the plane cried with 
joy when she saw her husband jesus and 2yearold son brian on 
television among the survivors being taken to hospitals 
i feel great im so happy happy crying everything she 
said 
her 13yearold niece jo ellen pena said her uncle and cousin 
were bandaged and bloody but seemed to be ok 
dr bruce rebold who lives in the affluent sparsely populated 
area near the crash site said he was reading the newspaper and a 
movie script when a picture fell off the wall and some pottery fell 
down 
he didnt hear anything but he felt the impact of what he later 
found out was the crash he looked out his window and did not see 
anything and ran out to the site 
rebold said he saw a portion of the fuselage with the red 
lettering avianca 
it looked like it hit a hill and cracked in half i saw people 
trying to scramble out of the plane i didnt see any bodies he 
said it was shocking it was like being on a movie set 
at kennedy airport about 200 anxious relatives and friends 
waited in the first class lounge of pan american world airways but 
complained that they received very little information from the 
remote site late reports had possibly as many as 50 dead and 
scores more injured 
mark marchese a spokesman for the port authority said they 
know its a crash but its a very eerie calm very little 
hysteria 
he said priests and rabbis were offering emotional support to 
those waiting others however sought comfort in finding out as 
much information as they could 
several of the relatives wandered over to a bank of payforview 
miniature television sets in the airport and watched for the latest 
information 
among those waiting for word of survivors was jairo perez who 
said he saw his sister elena on television he said elena had 
gone to colombia to adopt a girl he said the child also survived 
in tears he said in spanish theyre alive

in an affluent area just south of the sagamore hill national 
historic site home of president theodore roosevelt it is a 
isolated wooded area of expensive homes on twoacre lots whose 
residents include the parents of tennis pro john mcenroe 
rescue efforts were hindered by the narrow road that leads to 
the crash site the road was clogged with rescue vehicle and many 
of the rescue crews had to park far away from the crash site and 
carry equipment to the injured passengers

the securities and exchange commission has 
suspended for 10 days trading in the securities of bolar 
pharmaceutical co the generic drug maker accused of falsifying 
safety claims 
the sec said it temporarily suspended bolar trading thursday due 
to the lack of adequate current information concerning the recent 
public disclosure that certain false documents were submitted to 
the food and drug administration 
on tuesday a house subcommittee disclosed a letter from bolars 
attorneys that indicated the copaigue nybased generic drug 
maker apparently falsified documents about safety tests for its 
version of the popular blood pressurecontrolling drug dyazide 
made by smithkline beecham 
the sec said suspension began at 930 am thursday and would 
continue until 1159 pm on feb 3

company did not disclose enough information and when we can we 
will said bolar spokeswoman patricia shukri refusing to comment 
further 
bolars antihypertension drug is the only generic version of 
dyazide on the market another company pulled its version after it

the food and drug administration is cautioning 
consumers against buying potentially dangerous ltryptophan dietary 
supplements distributed nationally by a california company 
the company nutricology inc of san leandro calif which 
also markets under the name of allergy research group has not 
complied with an urgent fda recall request the agency said 
thursday 
a woman answering the companys telephone refused to relay 
repeated calls to a company official or supervisor 
the fda said 334 other manufacturers repackers and distributors 
have complied with the nov 17 request for recall of products that 
would result in a total dietary intake of 100 milligrams or more of 
ltryptophan a day 
the fda requested the recall because ltryptophan an amino 
acid has been linked to eosinophiliamyalgia syndrome which is 
marked by severe muscle and joint pain swelling of the arms and 
legs skin rash and sometimes fever 
the centers for disease control has reports of 1143 cases of 
the syndrome including nine deaths one of which has been 
confirmed to have been clearly associated with ltryptophan 
public health experts have not been able to identify a specific 
lot brand manufacturer or supplier of the supplement as the cause 
of the outbreak they also have been unable to pinpoint a specific 
chemical or microbial contaminant that could be responsible the

researchers say a synthetic compound has been 
shown in laboratory experiments to prevent reproduction of the aids 
virus in a way different than azt the only antiviral drug now 
approved for use against aids 
the compound a manmade peptide called u81749 appears to block 
the final stage of a process the aids virus uses to reproduce 
itself in human cells azt or zidovudine attacks an earlier stage 
in the life cycle of the virus 
it u81749 drastically slows down and reduces the number of 
mature viral particles you get in an infection leonard post 
director of infectious disease research at the upjohn co where 
the compound was developed said thursday 
the compound works by inhibiting the action of protease an 
enzyme used by the aids virus to process proteins during the final 
stages of its reproduction post said the result is that the virus 
cannot make mature copies of itself and this prevents the spread 
of infection to other cells he said 
post emphasized that the compound has been used only in test 
tubes on cultured cells and that it will be years before such a 
compound will be ready for human tests 
aids or acquired immune deficiency syndrome is caused by the 
human immunodeficiency virus or hiv when this virus invades a 
human cell it takes over the cells proteinmaking machinery to 
reproduce itself 
during this process the virus directs the creation of a number 
of different proteins protease is an enzyme the virus uses to chop 
up a large protein molecule called p55 into several different 
types of smaller protein molecules needed to make a mature hiv 
particle 
post said that by blocking the action of protease the p55 
molecule is not processed and the viral particle does not mature

texas congressmen are questioning president 
bushs commitment to the super collider now that he has requested 
318 million instead of the expected 393 million for secondyear 
construction funds 
bushs budget to be unveiled monday will ask for 75 million 
less than what had been anticipated for the giant particle 
accelerator being built in ellis county texas sen phil gramm 
said thursday 
sen lloyd bentsen dtexas said he had hoped for a higher 
starting point since i have no doubt with our budget deficit 
situation that congress will whittle away at it 
only a few days ago a white house spokesman was warning that 
congress might make cuts in the presidents budget for the ssc 
supercollider what he didnt warn us was that wed see 
substantial cuts before congress even gets its turn bentsen said 
bush last year requested 250 million for the ssc congress 
allocated 225 million 
rep jim chapman dtexas said the new request certainly 
shows less than the full commitment of the administration to the 
project 
gramm rtexas said he was assured by deputy energy secretary 
w henson moore that the 318 million represents as much as the doe 
believes it could actually spend in 1991 on the collider 
the collider would be in far greater danger in congress from the 
sticker shock of a higher price tag should the energy 
department recommend the cost exceed 59 billion gramm said 
he said moore told him the lower figure would not have any 
impact on the project which if completed would be the largest 
most complicated scientific instrument ever built scientists hope 
to use it to test theories about the building blocks of the 
universe

he said there were few homes in the area 
i heard a rumbling a very loud rumbling said whitelaw who 
was on an indoor tennis court at the time it sounded as if your 
car was gearing back and you were stripping the gears and the 
typical rumble you get from a jet plane going over 
normally in bad weather they circle out here but this was 
louder than normal then we heard the crash he said adding that 
through the woods i see no flames or smoke or smell anything 
he said the road leading to the crash site was clogged with 
emergency vehicles 
these are very narrow roads whitelaw said theyre trying 
the best they can to get to where it crashed theyre running up

the key witness against richard miller the 
only fbi agent convicted of spying alleged that the agency may 
have covered up information that would have helped millers 
defense court papers show 
retired fbi agent john hunt also said in documents filed 
thursday that the agency knew miller wasnt the only fbi agent 
sexually involved with soviet informant svetlana ogorodnikov 
miller a 20year fbi veteran was convicted of passing 
classified documents to mrs ogorodnikov with whom he was having 
an affair 
his conviction was overturned by a federal appeals court last 
year based on the admission of liedetector evidence at his trial 
he is free on bail awaiting his third trial expected to begin come 
spring 
hunts allegations in a letter to fbi director william sessions 
last summer were among volumes of documents filed by millers 
lawyers thursday as part of a motion to dismiss the charges against 
miller 
hunt was a key witness in the 1985 and 1986 trials millers 
first jury deadlocked the second convicted him 
in his 10page letter hunt alleged the bureau covered up in 
order to divert public and congressional attention away from the 
fbis own administrative mishandling of miller prior to his 
arrest 
at his trials miller was portrayed as an overweight inept fbi 
misfit who turned to spying out of vengeance but he maintained he 
was trying to redeem a lackluster career by recruiting mrs 
ogorodnikov as a double agent and infiltrating the soviet spy 
network 
the letter was recently obtained by the defense lawyers who 
subpoenaed it over government opposition 
the hunt letter requested a meeting between hunt and sessions 
but a response showed that sessions refused because of pending 
litigation 
in a letter to sessions hunts lawyer lynn lincoln sarko said 
mr hunt believes that the fbi may have engaged in a coverup 
of this affair by concealing certain information and by failing to 
follow up leads in the espionage case and by knowingly 
falsifying the results of its own investigations 
sarkos letter and other documents suggested that another fbi 
agent assigned to the foreign counterintelligence squad with miller 
had a sexual affair with mrs ogorodnikov the agents name was 
blacked out of classified documents attached to the motion 
hunt has denied defense claims that he had an affair with mrs 
ogorodnikov 
hunts lawyer raised the question of whether fbi mishandling of 
the case may have deprived miller and ogorodnikov of their most 
logical and powerful defense to the charges against them 
defense attorneys stanley greenberg and joel levine alleged that 
miller was the victim of prosecutorial misconduct in a coverup of 
evidence helpful to the former agents defense 
defendant miller has always insisted that his objective in the 
relationship with svetlana was to benefit the fbi said the 
defense motion the fact that other agents on the very same squad 
may have had a similar relationship with her and similar 
objectives certainly bears on the reasonableness of conduct 
messages were left thursday for assistant us attorney russell 
hayman and sessions but they did not return calls 
a hearing on the motion was set for march 26

is it a contradiction to love animals and 
still shoot them dead 
a new movie says no and depicts hunters as naturalists 
likely to become one of the years more divisive films in the 
blood is a featurelength documentary arguing that biggame 
hunting plays an integral role in conservation 
written and directed by george butler a hunter from age 6 in 
the blood takes the position that one does not hunt in order to 
kill 
it shows hunting as a bonding rite and a fundamental privilege 
the movie opening feb 16 in houston was shown thursday in the 
documentary competition of the sundance united states film festival 
i had a tremendously difficult time making this movie 
butler said the prejudice against hunting is so powerful in the 
film industry 
butler released his pumping iron bodybuilding films 
independently because hollywood frowned upon that topic too 
i make films about unfashionable subjects butler said 
five years in the making in the blood was backed by 20 
investors including the huntingwetland preservation group ducks 
unlimited 
in a creative fundraising move president theodore roosevelts 
holland amp holland rifle was purchased and resold by the production 
company to help make ends meet 
among the more noteworthy organizations not sponsoring the film 
the national rifle association im sure that i could have gotten 
all the money i needed from the nra butler said but i have no 
association with them theyre a gun lobby not a hunting 
lobby 
indeed butler said he has tried not to arouse undue 
controversy he prefers to let the film speak for itself 
wherever the movie has been shown a few people have walked out 
butler said 
although the film does not glorify hunting it shows a young 
hunters errant shot causing a buffalo to die a slow death it 
does state no animal in africa dies of old age if a bullet 
doesnt kill an older lion something else will 
the films premise is that hunting when wellconceived and 
wellexecuted improves the cycle of life 
in remarks after the films showing robin hurt a veteran 
hunting guide who appears in the movie said we have interfered 
so much in the balance of nature in the past that we need to keep 
interfering to balance the scales

a police officer facing a 7year sentence for 
manslaughter in the deaths of two black men will be spared any 
prison time for at least a year while his appeal and a novel legal 
issue are considered attorneys say 
but the police career of william lozano 30 is over because of 
the felony conviction his attorney said his fatal shooting of a 
speeding motorcyclist and the passengers death triggered three 
nights of rioting a year ago 
lozano who was on the police force four years faces firing 
most likely at a departmental disciplinary review board hearing in 
may department spokesman raymond lang said thursday lozano also 
stands to lose his state certification as a police officer 
his job as a police officer is finished defense attorney 
roy black said hes going out to look for a job 
black said lozano would not comment 
on wednesday the jury that convicted lozano sentenced him to 
seven years in prison but let him remain free on bond while his 
lawyers appeal 
black expects the case to continue for at least a year the 
usual time frame for a case before the 3rd district court of 
appeals in miami 
richard shiffrin a dade county prosecutor who will supervise 
the states appeal suspects it could go much longer 
if we prevail im sure the defense will take it further if 
we lost on an issue that was reviewable by the florida supreme 
court or the us supreme court we would certainly pursue our 
avenues also i would expect this case to be around for a while 
he said 
there are a number of issues that are litigable all he has to 
do is win one to overturn the conviction or strike down the 
sentence shiffrin said we have to win them all 
the leastexplored legal question is the decision by dade 
circuit judge joseph farina to seat a black juror after the defense 
tried to oust him with a peremptory challenge normally an 
uncontestable way of removing unwanted jurors 
postal union executive ezra simmons was seated on the judges 
order and went on to become the jury foreman 
a few other states accept the forced seating of a juror when 
race is the only factor for removal but the current florida 
standard is to throw out the jury pool and start all over again 
shiffrin noted 
wed be there all year if we were forced to strike the panel 
so the judge did the only possible thing he said 
the us supreme court hasnt considered the issue of forced 
seating 
among other issues raised by the defense are the judges 
failure to move the trial out of miami after the rioting his 
refusal to hear witnesses on the changeofvenue issue the 
introduction of police regulations as evidence on the use of deadly 
force by an officer and the exclusion of evidence about the 
backgrounds of the two dead men

eye doctors traditionally immune from much 
of the despair their colleagues in the medical profession face 
increasingly are being confronted with the cruel realities of aids 
patients going blind before death 
at a conference thursday on vision impairment among aids 
patients ophthalmologists and medical and social workers were 
cautioned they not only must steep themselves in the latest medical 
treatments but learn to deal with the distinct emotional crises of 
people with the immunedestroying disease 
you have the double challenge of not just making medical 
theory alive you are bringing hope alive the rev william 
barcus told the group 
barcus who has had aids for five years slowly is losing his 
sight 
there are two things we live in deadly fear of the first is 
blindness the second great terror is dementia while these may 
be theory to you to us they are terribly real nerveshattering 
heartbreaking the episcopal minister said 
there are no precise figures on how many people with aids suffer 
from some sort of visionrelated problems but various medical 
studies range in estimates from 10 percent to 40 percent as of 
nov 30 there have been 115158 cases of aids reported in the 
united states 
as well as despair ophthalmologists also must deal with 
selfpity panic and even terror in aids patients 
psychologist marsha young who works with visually impaired aids 
patients in oakland described their loss or impairment of sight as 
often mentally devastating it sometimes leads to contemplation of 
suicide 
it is normal for a person to mourn the loss of sight but 
for a person with aids to start to mourn is sometimes a way of 
giving up and its accompanied by all the feelings that go along 
with that frustration hopelessness powerlessness she said 
until the last few years of the aids epidemic few eye doctors 
had to face the death of their patients dr william shekter chief 
of the department of ophthalmology at kaiser permanente medical 
center in san francisco told the conference 
not since the end of world war ii when thousands of us 
soldiers returned home with visionrelated injuries has the 
ophthalmology industry faced such a dramatic change in clientele 
he said 
besides finding previously unseen eye diseases in young adults 
with aids ophthalmologists are learning how tenaciously and 
ferociously a healthy young person with aids will fight to retain 
vision shekter said 
vision problems associated with aids which destroys the bodys 
ability to fight even common infections were first documented in 
1985 
more vision problems are being treated in aids patients because 
earlier diagnosis and improved treatment has prolonged their lives 
according to officials of the conference sponsored by the american 
foundation for the blind and the lighthouse for the blind and 
visually impaired vision problems appear to be associated with 
later stages of aids 
professionals at the conference were cautioned that few agencies 
now providing traditional services to the blind and visually 
impaired are prepared to offer rehabilitative and counseling 
assistance that may be needed for many of the estimated 1 million 
to 15 million americans already infected with the aids virus

the dollar closed lower against the japanese yen 
today after an overnight fall in new york while the key index on 
the tokyo stock exchange lost moderately 
after opening at 14365 yen the dollar ranged between 14350 
yen and 14425 yen before closing the week at 14397 yen down 133 
yen from thursdays close of 14530 yen 
the dollar was traded in a relatively narrow range 
following its slide to 143925 yen from 14571 in new york 
thursday said akihiko hori a dealer with mitsui bank ltd 
he said he believed the sharp plunge of the dollar was a 
temporary move in response to us federal reserve board chairman 
alan greenspans call thursday for a withholding tax on foreign 
investors in the united states 
such a move would slow foreign investment which has been an 
important stimulus for recent us economic growth analysts say 
other traders attriuted the dollars decline to local reports 
that japans longterm prime rate would be raised by 07 percentage 
point to 75 percent starting on feb 1 
a banking source who spoke anonymously confirmed the reports 
in the nihon keizai shimbun a major economic newspaper and the 
masscirculation yomiuri shimbun he said however that some 
japanese longterm banks will unofficially announce their rate 
hikes earlier 
the prime rate is a preferential rate of interest charged by 
commercial banks on loans to their most creditworthy customers 
the planned raise in the prime rate was already factored into 
foreign exchange trading hori said 
but he said the measure will work as a stabilizing factor in 
yendollar trading 
higher interest rates tend to push up a countrys currency 
on the stock market the nikkei stock average of 225 selected 
issues which rose 19013 points thursday shed 9504 points or 
025 percent closing the week at 3687407 
the index gained 2049 points shortly after the markets opening 
it played a tug of war the whole day and the tokyo market 
proved to be strong said an analyst with daiwa securities co 
who spoke anonymously 
he said fluctuations in the nikkei index under 100 points would 
be too small to judge the markets direction 
the index started higher encouraged by the yens strength 
against the dollar even though the dow jones industrial average 
plunged 4346points in new york overnight he said but the market 
gradually lost steam as traders showed increasing concern over the 
amount of dow jones slide

more than a dozen political parties and 
reform groups are debating how to share power with communist 
premier hans modrow before free elections on may 6 
late thursday one of the four small parties aligned with the 
dominant communists announced it was resigning from modrows 
27member cabinet deepening the crisis of confidence facing the 
interim premier 
opposition groups like the neues forum prodemocracy movement 
and the newly formed social democrats have demanded a role in 
modrows transitional government but they are at odds with each 
other over how much power and responsibility they should take on 
as living standards have worsened along with the declining 
economy pressure for reunification with prosperous west germany 
has surged 
the decision by deputy premier lothar de maiziere and two fellow 
christian democrats to pull out of the communistled coalition was 
presented as a move to make way for opposition groups to enter the 
government he said the other minority parties who hold 11 seats 
in the cabinet were likely to resign as well 
but the pullout effective feb 9 also distances the christian 
democrats from the embattled communist party it served with over 
the past 40 years 
communists now hold 16 ministerial posts the liberal democrats 
four the christian democrats three and the national democrats and 
farmers party two each 
steffen reiche whose social democratic party currently has no 
representation in the government or parliament called the 
christian democrats announced departure the crowning 
irresponsibility of its 40year service 
the social democrats and other opposition groups fear that if 
the christian democrats succeed in cutting themselves off from the 
communists and therefore responsibility for the current state of 
the nation they would likely outpoll all other opposition groups 
in the may elections 
modrow a respected communist who has attempted to stay above 
the fray of the mounting political crisis flew to austria today 
for a oneday official visit 
the premier will travel to moscow on tuesday for talks with 
soviet president mikhail s gorbachev adn said late thursday 
modrow has been battling a groundswell of anticommunist 
sentiment in his nation of 16 million as east germans lose faith 
that the economic crisis can be fixed and flee to the west at the 
rate of about 2000 a day 
west germany has promised financial aid and solidarity with east 
germanys drive for democracy in hopes of slowing the emigration 
wave that threatens to send a million east germans to the west this 
year 
rudolf seiters chief of staff for west german chancellor helmut 
kohl told reporters after his visit here thursday that it was in 
bonns interest to help stabilize the east german political and 
economic situation 
seiters also announced that modrow will visit bonn on feb 1314 
to discuss the volatile situation in east germany 
he urged east germany to create perspectives that entice them 
to stay at home 
modrow told reporters at the start of his meeting with seiters 
that the solidarity of west germany in this difficult situation 
is absolutely necessary 
meanwhile economics minister christa luft and east german 
government spokesman wolfgang meyer met with reporters thursday to 
announce broad concessions to the demands of western investors 
both luft and meyer referred repeatedly to the need to stabilize 
the economy and political situation in east germany and 
acknowledged the urgent need to institute reforms that could halt 
the damaging exodus of east germans 
we should have spent a couple of weeks better planning what we 
would do after we opened the borders ms luft conceded 
she said the government has scrapped plans to limit foreign 
ownership of joint ventures to 49 percent east germany also plans 
to lift all restrictions on competition among private industry and 
craftsmen effectively opening the national economy to free 
enterprise according to meyer

government troops ordered people to stay 
off the streets today and searched houses for moslems waging a 
violent campaign for kashmirs secession from india witnesses 
reported 
at least 70 people mostly militant moslems have been killed 
since saturday when the government launched a harsh crackdown on 
kashmiri separatists to halt escalating violence 
moslem boys defied the curfew and burned indian flags after 
daybreak today a few hours later a state government official 
presided over a poorly attended ceremony on the 40th anniversary of 
the founding of the indian republic 
journalists were confined to a hotel and warned that they would 
be arrested and risked getting shot if they tried to leave 
in downtown srinagar where earlier in the week moslem crowds 
frequently defied the curfew confining them to their homes troops 
refused to let anyone outside people who started to open their 
windows were ordered to shut them 
only security forces and a few top officials were allowed 
outdoors 
the steppedup security coincided with the weekly islamic holy 
day often a boiling point for militant moslems and the 40th 
anniversary celebration 
on jan 26 1950 newly independent india forged together under 
one constitution an assortment of provinces once ruled by britain 
and princely states headed by maharajahs and nawabs 
the holiday was denounced as a black day by the moslem 
separatists who want to secede from predominantly hindu india and 
become independent or join neighboring pakistan an islamic nation 
from various vantage points in srinagar a city of 1 million 
people only heavily armed troops and an occasional government 
official could be seen on the streets 
united news of india quoted an official spokesman as saying nine 
people were killed and 14 wounded on thursday in handwara 40 miles 
northwest of srinagar unofficial sources has said thursday night 
that three people were killed when troops fired on a rioting mob 
sources who were contacted by telephone from jammu the states 
winter capital said troops conducted housetohouse searches in 
several parts of srinagar and the nearby towns of anantnag and 
baramulla 
several moslem youths were detained the sources said 
stipulating that they not be identified further 
kashmir is the toughest challenge prime minister vp singh has 
faced since he took office dec 2 six days later moslem 
extremists abducted the daughter of singhs home minister kashmiri 
moslem mufti mohammad sayeed and held her until the government 
freed five jailed moslem militants 
the separatist violence escalated as the miliants attacked 
patrols and set fire to government buildings an aroundtheclock 
curfew was imposed saturday in srinagar and surrounding towns 
hundreds if not thousands of troops were dispatched 
the federal government last week appointed jagmohan a hindu who 
uses only one name and who is known as a tough administrator as

the military government which has barred 
several top opposition leaders from running in burmas next 
election said today that american observers will not be allowed to 
monitor the balloting 
the announcement came as students in the countrys two largest 
cities demonstrated this week to support an opposition leader who 
was banned from participating in the elections western diplomats 
said today 
heavy fighting meanwhile was reported between government 
troops and karen rebels along the thailand border sixty fighters 
were killed and 25 injured in five days of fighting in which 
government troops overrun one rebel base and part of another 
police said today thousands of civilians fled the fighting 
the elections set for may 27 are to be the first multiparty 
parliamentary vote since 1960 but in the past month the three 
main opposition figures have been excluded from running 
sen daniel patrick moynihan dny asked for a us team to 
be allowed to witness the election the usfunded voice of 
america reported thursday 
asked about the report a government spokesman col aung thein 
told a news conference today where is the need to come and 
observe the election since he has already presumed that it will 
not be free and fair 
the spokesman said 2392 candidates were contesting the election 
because they believed it would be fair 
it is futile and meaningless to say the election would not be 
free and fair simply because one or two of the candidates are not 
participating because they infringed the election law he said 
on jan 16 ms aung san suu kyi coleader of the national 
league for democracy was disqualified after being linked by the 
government with a student rebel group she has been under house 
arrest since july

sentenced by a military tribunal to three years imprisonment on 
charges of subversion

house arrest and also banned from the balloting 
the western diplomats said groups of students on bicycles held 
rallies in the countrys second most populous city mandalay in 
recent days to back ms suu kyi the protesters waved the flag of 
her party and shouted slogans the diplomats in rangoon said in 
telephone interviews speaking anonymously 
young people also assembled in groups of 30 or 40 in violation 
of martial law which prohibits gatherings of more than five 
people one diplomat said 
mandalay 350 miles north of rangoon was a center of the huge 
prodemocracy demonstrations that lasted several months in 1988 
before the military crushed them hundreds of people were killed 
one diplomat reported that there were also street protests in 
the capital on monday tuesday and wednesday 
he cited unconfirmed reports that at least 50 protesters had 
been arrested 
burma has been ruled by martial law since september 1988 when 
gen saw maung seized power in a coup and suppressed the 
prodemocracy movement 
since then thousands of dissidents have been detained casting 
doubt on the regimes pledge of a free and fair election 
in the fighting along the border 1500 burmese troops began 
attacking the karen bases of the ba bow and nearby maeng ka ra on 
saturday border police sources said speaking on condition of 
anonymity 
they captured maeng ka ra and part the ba bow the sources said 
both camps are close to thailands northwestern border 
about 30 fighters on each side were reported killed and 20 
burmese and five karen rebels wounded the police said 
fighting has raged in the surrounding area since jan 17 and has 
sent 5000 karen civilians fleeing across the thai border thai 
villagers living on the frontier also have fled to escape the 
fighting the sources said 
the karens are one of the largest of the diverse ethnic groups 
fighting the burmese government they have resisted the integration 
of the the karen state into the union of burma since rangoon gained 
independence from britain in 1948

shrill sirens pierced the fogshrouded 
skies and helicopters hovered overhead as rescue workers scrambled 
to pull survivors from the wreckage of a colombian jetliner 
minutes after the avianca boeing 707 crashed thursday night on a 
hillside in this exclusive long island village word went out to 
dozens of volunteer fire departments sending a stream of 
firefighting apparatus and ambulances to the site 
the planes nose smashed into the deck of the home of sam 
tiesenbaum and his wife they said the house shook and there was a 
sound like thunder we thought it was an earthquake they told 
authorities 
arriving rescue workers heard the screams of trapped passengers 
who moaned in pain and cried out to loved ones in spanish 
kids were screaming for their parents parents were screaming 
for their kids said robert labella a nearby resident who helped 
remove six people from the wreckage after that i just couldnt 
take it anymore 
larry rubinstein a rescue volunteer said the scene was very 
chaotic but he and others said an odd sense of order set in as 
passengers realized they had survived and rescue crews went to 
work 
it was very crazy at first but the police got things under 
control and everybody started the task of getting everyone the 
survivors out of the aircraft rubinstein said 
morris benny of the east norwich fire department said some 
survivors were already sitting on the plane a couple were trying 
to walk out 
scores of the passengers aboard the avianca flight from bogota 
colombia to kennedy international airport were injured at least 
67 of the passengers and crew among the more than 140 aboard were

morning worked in a cold drizzle using pneumatic chisels to pry 
away wreckage

the center quickly dispatched 20 of the countys volunteer fire 
departments to the scene eight others were on standby units from 
the emergency medical service came from new york city 
as far as how many people were involved i couldnt say 
simon said 
the plane broken in three places came to rest on a steep 
wooded hillside on a peninsula that juts into long island sound a 
neighborhood dotted with milliondollar estates trees 60 to 80 
feet tall and thick as a telephone pole had been snapped off 
the remote location complicated the rescue effort 
rescuers laid ladders up the hillside to reached the splintered 
fuselage and formed a human chain passing survivors down the 
hillside they set up a makeshift morgue on the front lawn of a 
home owned by the parents of tennis star john mcenroe 
you could hear people crying and screaming firefighter tom 
czajkowski said a lot of passengers were dead and a lot were in 
shock some of them were talking to us we told them to hang in 
there wed get them out 
simon said the crush of rescue equipment and onlookers clogged 
the windy twolane road leading to the crash site we had a 
gridlock problem we couldnt get the ambulances in he said 
workers tried to reassure passengers as they worked to free them 
from the crushed seats inside the plane 
i told them in my broken spanish that they were lucky and we 
would get them out said dr george dunn they were not 
hysterical just mostly in shock 
soon helicopters were shuttling the injured from the crash site 
and caravans of ambulances made their way to and from the scene 
peter dowd of the syosset fire department said he worked his way 
into the plane through the rear and spent 1 hours inside while 
about 25 passengers were extricated he said he helped support an 
american passenger who was having difficulty breathing 
the passenger told him the aircraft had been circling before the 
crash then suddenly lost lighting and power 
they went down like an escalator dowd said the woman told 
him

medical students are often shouted at and 
occasionally physically threatened in the course of their training 
according to two studies 
its a lot like child abuse said dr dewitt baldwin who 
directs medical education research for the american medical 
association he cowrote one of two studies in todays journal of 
the american medical association we knew it was there but we 
somehow couldnt believe it 
in a survey of 75 thirdyear medical students 85 percent said 
they had been yelled or shouted at at least once during 
training wrote baldwin and researchers at the university of south 
florida in tampa in some cases the yelling came from patients 
but most frequently it was another medical staff member or a 
teacher doing the yelling the survey found 
the same percentage also said they had been humiliated or 
subjected to inappropriately nasty or hostile behavior the 
researchers reported 
more alarming 24 percent of the students said they had been 
physically threatened most frequently by patients and 16 percent 
said theyd actually been physically abused either slapped 
kicked hit or had things thrown at them 
most women students 81 percent said they had been subject to 
sexism most often by clinical faculty and residents or interns 
more than half 55 percent said they had been targets of 
unwelcome sexual advances 
half of the nonwhite students said they had endured racial or 
ethnic slurs though none reported being denied opportunities 
because of race or ethnicity 
more than twothirds of those surveyed felt that mistreatment in 
their training had interfered with their emotional health and 37 
percent seriously considered leaving medical school as a result 
the study said 
coauthor k harnett sheehan conceded that verbal abuse of 
medical students is an ageold problem but suggested the 
studies may prompt efforts to make the medical school environment 
a more pleasant more attractive place 
dr henry silver coauthor of an accompanying study said he 
found students were abused far more often than he had expected 
silver an associate dean for admissions at the university of 
colorado school of medicine in denver and his colleagues surveyed 
431 students four out of every five students reported mistreatment 
at some time during their medical education 
sixteen percent said they had been so affected by the abuse that 
they would carry it with them for the rest of their lives 
silvers study defined abuse as avoidable treatment that is 
harmful injurious or offensive and included such things as verbal 
attacks 
the study recounted the experience of one student who asked his 
superior to allow him to stop examining the eye of a fellow student 
who was in obvious pain 
when i explained this to the supervising physician he said 
oh good this gives us an opportunity to learn how to force a 
patient to cooperate even if they are in pain 
researchers in both studies emphasized that the schools they 
surveyed the university of colorado school of medicine and the 
university of south florida college of medicine were typical of 
medical schools 
they said both schools have started to amend their programs so 
that future students may not be mistreated 
in an editorial in this weeks journal dr jerald kay urges 
medical schoools to educate their faculty and staff on students 
rights and to make provisions for those who abuse others

portauprince haiti ap france suspended aid to haiti and 
broke off talks on a new 500 million aid package to protest human 
rights violations by the caribbean countrys military government 
french officials said today 
french minister of cooperation jacques pelletier canceled a 
visit scheduled for last monday after the president lt gen 
prosper avril decreed a 30day state of siege a french embassy 
spokesman said on condition of anonymity 
more than 50 political leaders have been arrested since the 
weekend most have been released but several have been exiled to 
the united states or france and a radical political leader was 
reported missing on thursday 
france which once controlled haiti was the most generous 
international donor to haiti in 1989 giving 50 million for 
financing development projects 
aid continued at about the same level this year although an aid 
package valued at 500 million during the next two years was to 
have been negotiated at the suspended meeting of the haitianfrench 
cooperation commission said a haitian official who spoke on the 
condition of anonymity 
in paris the french foreign ministry said current payments to 
haiti also were being cut 
france took the action because of the scope of human rights 
violations and the interruption of public liberties in haiti the 
ministry said in a statement 
french officials will be consulting with other aid donors to 
examine measures that might lead gen avril to respect his promises 
to restore democracy it said 
it said france has intervened to obtain the release of some 
people who were arrested and to try to make sure they were not 
physically mistreated 
france asks the haitian government urgently to reestablish 
the suspended provisions of the constitution to reverse the 
measures of detention and banishment of opposition leaders and to 
guarantee the restarting of an authentic election process the 
statement said 
when reporters asked avril on thursday when he would lift the 
state of siege he frowned and said it could be tomorrow 
he commented after a brief ceremony at the national palace in 
which guy mendes binheiro vaconcellos the new brazilian 
ambassador presented his credentials 
avril also repeated his promise to hold elections now scheduled 
for october we are on the way to elections he said without 
elaborating 
critics accuse avril of using the killing on saturday of col 
andre neptune his wife and a servant by unidentified assailants as 
a pretext to crack down on the opposition and renege on elections 
avril did not say whether seven prominent civic leaders and 
militants expelled since saturday would be allowed to return if the 
state of siege is lifted 
rockefeller guerre head of the leftist union of patriotic 
democrats party and an outspoken critic of avril was reported 
missing by his wife 
i havent heard from my husband since monday and i am worried 
because he always told me he would never go into hiding mrs 
guerre said in an interview she said she thought he may have been 
arrested 
haiti received 154 million in international assistance in 1988 
but had been the object of international ostracism since the nov 
29 1987 electionday massacre staged by thugs working with the 
army 
the us government cut off about twothirds of its 90 million 
aid package after the 1987 massacre 
haiti still receives about 40 million in us aid through 
numerous private voluntary organizations 
to encourage the governments stated commitment to democracy 
the us government granted 10 million in free wheat under the 
food for peace program last year the united states also granted 
500000 to assist the avril government in fighting drug smuggling

members of the soviet parliaments opposition 
group condemned the government today for failing to quell ethnic 
violence in the caucasus and for relying on force instead of more 
negotiations 
azerbaijani activists meanwhile said commandos raided the 
republics mission in moscow overnight and arrested a nationalist 
leader a moscow police spokesman confirmed the raid and said it 
was being investigated 
a newspaper also reported today that president mikhail s 
gorbachev was warned by two senior soviet military leaders not to 
send troops into azerbaijan just hours before the soldiers were 
deployed 
thirteen members of the interregional group of progressive 
deputies in the soviet congress issued a declaration saying 
authorities took action too late in the simmering conflict 
between azerbaijanis and armenians 
they proposed an emergency session of the supreme soviet the 
governments standing legislature to mediate the dispute and 
called for a deadline for the withdrawal of soviet troops from 
azerbaijan 
the unrest and the governments delayed armed reaction to it 
represent a threat to perestroika the kremlins program of 
reforms deputy sergei stankevich said 
the opposition group claims about 400 members of the 
2250member congress of peoples deputies its leaders include 
reformer boris n yeltsin who was not at the news conference and 
historian yuri n afanasyev it was created largely under the 
inspiration of late nobelprizewinning human rights advocate 
andrei d sakharov although the group represents a clear minority 
in the congress its initiatives occasionally have won majority 
support 
the groups declaration said the azerbaijani government was at 
fault for losing people trust and added we are categorically 
against the use of force for the artifical preservation of such 
regimes 
soviet troops moved into the azerbaijani capital baku on 
saturday to quell the nationalist uprising and attacks on armenians 
there 
the violence was the culmination of a twoyear dispute between 
mainly christian armenians and moslem azerbaijanis over their 
respective claims to nagornokarabakh an azerbaijani enclave 
populated mainly by ethnic armenians 
the dispute has fueled the independence movements in the 
neighboring soviet republics which are among several seeking 
automony from moscow 
two senior soviet officers in baku warned hours before gorbachev 
sent troops to azerbaijan that an assault would turn the population 
against the army and ethnic russians a newspaper reported today 
the two afghan war veterans said in a telegram sent jan 19 that 
bringing in troops would lead to a total break in relations and 
put their families in danger as well as creating a growth in 
the antirussian mood 
that same night soviet troops raided the azerbaijani capital 
by latest count 101 people have died since then and more than 171 
overall in the unrest that began with antiarmenian attacks in baku 
two weeks ago 
the dangers predicted by cols a savelyev and a rusakov top 
officials in a baku military academy have been realized and more 
than 30000 family members of soviet soldiers have had to be 
evacuated said the youth newspaper komsomolskaya pravda 
meanwhile azerbaijani activists said today that police twice 
raided the azerbaijani governments building in moscow during the 
night and arrested a leader of the nationalist azerbaijani peoples 
front ekhtibar mamedov 
moscow deputy police chief lev belyansky confirmed the raid but 
said he would give no more information until the investigation was 
done tass reported 
activist shain gajiyev said commandos charged into the 
government mission at 3 am searched it and herded about 40 
azerbaijani men into buses he said all were released except 
mamedov who has gained attention recently by pushing azerbaijani 
claims that there were far more people killed in the troops 
assault on baku than the official death toll 
in baku military commandant lt gen vladimir dubinyak said 
today the situation was relatively calm the soviet news agency 
tass reported 
in the last 24 hours 147 people had been detained in baku 
either for breaking curfew or other violations tass said and two 
newspapers were banned by military authorities the agency said 
troops did not use weapons thursday but komsomolskaya pravda 
reported two people killed in baku when an armored personnel 
carrier ran over a car 
shooting also continued around a barracks where according to 
some reports azerbaijani troops are fighting soviets military 
authorities denied azerbaijani soldiers turned against the army 
komsomolskaya pravda ventured some of the first criticism in the 
official soviet press against the troops in baku it noted that 
dozens of people had been hospitalized with accidental shooting 
wounds blamed on the soldiers 
we dont presume to advise the military but after all there 
are other means of imposing order it said 
strikes continued to paralyze much of baku but soviet media 
said many stores had opened for the first time since the jan 20 
assault azerbaijanis have pledged not to end their strikes until 
soviet troops withdraw 
a ceasefire agreed to thursday by belligerents in the 
azerbaijans nakhichevan region was being observed said journalist 
ashot gazarian of the armenian news agency armenpress he said 
azerbaijans rail blockade of armenia was continuing

parliament today heeded warnings to avoid 
vindictiveness and dropped consideration of a law that would have 
allowed the government to take control of the communist partys 
considerable wealth 
the sejm or parliament voted 24629 to withdraw the draft law 
which was submitted by legislators who advocated radical moves to 
regain for the national treasury the buildings companies cars and 
other property amassed by the communists during four decades of 
rule 
communist party buildings in several cities have been occupied 
by members of the public who want to regain the property 
the occupiers often young members of radical opposition groups 
have demanded that the property be given to universities or other 
public use 
aleksander hall the cabinet minister responsible for political 
parties denounced such action 
we will not build a democratic poland we will not build a 
democratic state if the law is not the law hall said 
he told legislators that accepting the draft law would be 
reminiscent of the road chosen by communists after world war ii 
the prime minister of the solidarityled government taduesz 
mazowiecki urged that the temptation for revenge be rejected 
the status of the wealth now will be decided by a commission 
established by mazowiecki the commission met for the first time 
thursday and elicited a promise from the communist partys central 
committee to submit a list of holdings by midfebruary 
nearly 100 solidarity members of parliament had sponsored the 
draft law to reclaim communist party holdings but most withdrew 
their backing after a lengthy caucus meeting wednesday 
deputy zygmunt lupina said thursday most deputies accepted 
arguments presented by hall during the caucus and bowed to the 
prime ministers position that the question should be resolved in a 
more orderly fashion 
the communists reacted to the draft law with a barrage of 
commentaries in their daily newspaper and speeches contending they 
were being unfairly attacked 
the problem of party assets should be solved in a reasonable 
way not by robbery first secretary mieczyslaw f rakowski said 
tuesday 
communist leaders have said they want to find new ways to use 
their buildings and other property to support the party they said 
ownership disputes should be resolved in court 
opponents contend many holdings are not legally owned by the 
party which was able to accumulate property through its control of 
the government 
the property issue came to the fore as the communists prepared 
for the opening of their 11th national congress saturday 
the party formally called the polish united workers party is 
expected to be revived under a new name and given a new platform as 
leaders try to find a place for it in polands democratic future 
more than 40 years of communist party rule ended aug 23 1989 
when parliament approved a solidarityled coalition government 
headed by mazowiecki a former opposition activist 
the communist party in june lost control of the parliament in 
the freest elections in the east bloc in more than four decades

from staging protests in titova mitrovica podujevo and several 
other kosovo towns tanjug said

all people in kosovo both the majority albanians and minority 
serbs

more than 100000 people had joined his movement in the past month 
rugova said the group which has been criticized by authorities 
as hostile and separatist had applied for official registration 
and expected a reply by next week

promoting human rights in the region and he denied allegations by 
serbian leaders that the movements were linked to opposition 
parties in slovenia

twentyone people accused of illegally collecting 
and selling protected cactus plants worth thousands of dollars have 
been indicted on federal charges as a result of a fouryear 
undercover investigation 
we live in a very fragile environment in arizona and we 
intend to do what we can to maintain that environment us 
attorney steven mcnamee said we intend to prosecute vigorously 
anyone involved in stealing cacti 
the indictments alleged thousands of cacti primarily barrel 
cactus but also including towering saguaros some hundreds of years 
old have been uprooted and stolen since 1986 from federal state 
or private lands throughout arizona 
healthy saguaros can sell for hundreds of dollars and prized 
crested plants sell for as much as 15000 the saguaro cactus 
is not listed as endangered but is protected under arizonas native 
plant law and under a federal law that prohibits the interstate 
trafficking of protected plants its also arizonas state plant 
nineteen of the 21 people charged in the fish and wildlife 
service investigation had been arrested as of early today they 
were named in indictments issued wednesday by federal grand juries 
in phoenix and tucson officials said 
charges include theft of federal property conspiracy and 
illegal interstate transportation of protected plants the charges 
carry a maximum penalty of 10 years in prison and a 250000 fine 
this action demonstrates that the federal government takes 
very seriously its responsibility to protect plants interior 
secretary manuel lujan said in a statement issued in washington 
lujan who is from new mexico called the saguaro a cherished 
part of our western landscape and said those who collect them 
illegally are stealing from the public for their own personal 
profit 
people come from all over the world to see these giant saguaro 
cactus this is a big part of our tourist industry like the grand 
canyon mcnamee said 
investigators said the defendants allegedly removed saguaros 
from remote areas during the night and sold them to nurseries 
development companies and collectors in arizona kansas nevada 
california and such foreign countries as canada and japan 
the investigation was characterized as the largest federal case 
ever undertaken involving a protected plant 
fish and wildlife agents alerted to the cactus theft problem by 
arizona officials several years ago set up a phony business in 
suburban scottsdale in 1986 and began posing as cactus dealers 
we saw what we felt was a very flourishing business when we 
first started said richard marks the fish and wildlife service 
agent who headed the investigation 
the saguaros cactus is is protected by arizona state law because 
it is highly vulnerable to damage by vandals and because the plants 
do not begin to reproduce until they are 50 to 75 years old 
officials said approximately 150 large saguaros from 12 to 20 
feet tall and nine crested saguaros were sold to federal agents 
marks said it wasnt yet known what will happen to them 
cactuses legally obtained from public lands have a tag and a 
government seal 
the sonoran desert in southern arizona and mexico is the only 
place saguaros grow naturally marks said

parliament voted friday to drop a volatile 
proposal to nationalize communist party wealth bowing to the 
solidarityled governments argument that a commission should 
review the propertys status 
the sejm voted 24629 to accept the withdrawal of a draft law 
submitted by members who advocated radical moves to regain for the 
national treasury buildings companies cars and other assets 
amassed by the communist party in four decades of control 
prime minister tadeusz mazowiecki who has warned against the 
temptation to take revenge on the communists had asked that the 
bill be withdrawn 
mazowiecki the first noncommunist to lead a government in the 
east bloc had ended public subsidies to political parties and 
banned the further sale or lease of state property to parties 
but a potentially divisive public clamor grew when the 
government did not move to regain the communists holdings 
aleksander hall the cabinet minister responsible for political 
parties said nationalizing the communist party assets would be 
reminiscent of the road chosen by communists after world war ii 
addressing the lower house of parliament before the vote friday 
hall criticized the occupations mostly by students of local 
communist party buildings in several cities nationwide 
we will not build a democratic poland we will not build a 
democratic state if the law is not the law he said 
the occupiers often young members of radical opposition groups 
have demanded that the property be given to universities or other 
public use in some cities the party has agreed while in others 
municipal commissions have been set up to decide the disputes 
in a resolution adopted friday the sejm approved of the 
national commission established by mazowiecki while requiring 
monthly reports on the panels progress 
during the national commissions first meeting thursday the 
communist party central committee agreed to submit a tally of party 
property by feb 15 
nearly 100 solidarity parliament members had sponsored the draft 
law to reclaim communist party holdings but most withdrew their 
backing after a lengthy caucus wednesday 
sejm deputy zygmunt lupina said friday the group agreed to drop 
the proposal at mazowieckis request 
the communists had reacted vigorously to the nationalization 
drive calling it an attack that amounted to robbery 
party first secretary mieczyslaw f rakowski said a total 
takeover would deprive the reformed communist party of the means to 
survive 
the property issue came to the fore as the communists prepared 
to open their 11th national congress saturday the polish united 
workers party as the party is formally known is expected to be 
dissolved and reformed with a new name and program that leaders 
hope will salvage a place for it in polands democratic future 
without subsidies from the government budget the communists are 
counting on finding new ways to use their property to support the 
party

president bush will propose increasing 
spending for the strategic defense initiative to about 48 billion 
in fiscal 1991 despite congress success last year in slashing 
funds for star wars say congressional sources 
the budget total for sdi is about 1 billion more than last year 
when the democraticcontrolled congress approved 38 billion for 
the antimissile shield marking the first decrease in the program 
since president reagan introduced it six years ago 
the fiscal 1991 budget total includes between 45 billion and 
46 billion for the pentagon work on star wars congressional 
sources who spoke on condition of anonymity said thursday 
approximately 300 million more is earmarked for the department of 
energy and military construction 
lawmakers already are eyeing the sdi total as a cash cow for 
other programs particularly as democracies emerge in eastern 
europe lessening the soviet threat to the west and the budget 
deficit increases 
president bush will unveil his proposed budget monday spelling 
out the details in his state of the union speech wednesday 
congressional sources said defense secretary dick cheney would 
push for fullscale development of sdi that favors the brilliant 
pebbles plan a system composed of many small ground and 
spacebased interceptors that would sense enemy ballistic missiles 
the interceptors would ram the missiles causing them to explode 
a number of democrats on capitol hill have instead supported 
longterm research on directed energy weapons 
cheney also is proposing a sweeping list of military base 
closures and reductions at home and overseas just one year after 
congress agreed to 86 base closings and five realignments said 
pentagon and congressional sources 
among the bases targeted are 
the philadelphia naval shipyard a shipbuilding and repair 
center that has 9000 military and 20000 civilian workers 
in california the san franciscos treasure island naval 
station the alameda naval air station the oakland naval supply 
center and the oakland naval hospital as well as the long beach 
naval shipyard 
the armys fort monroe a training center in hampton va 
reportedly was on the list however a spokesman for sen john 
warner rva said today that the senator has been assured the 
site will not be closed 
there are no significant base closures in virginia although 
there are several minor realignments said spokesman phil smith 
he said he had no information about the exact nature of those 
changes 
the armys 2nd armored division at fort hood texas would be 
disbanded under the plan about 10000 soldiers onefourth of fort 
hoods troop population are connected with the armored division at 
the base the largest military installation in the free world 
part of the division is stationed in europe and pentagon 
officials stressed that any reduction in forces there would be 
along the lines of superpower arms control reduction pacts 
fort mcclellan ala would be closed in 1993 and its military 
police and chemical weapons schools relocated to other bases 
according to members of the alabama congressional delegation 
fort ord calif would be closed and the 7th infantry 
division stationed there would be transferred to fort lewis wash 
the 9th infantry division at fort lewis is slated to be sharply 
cut back 
besides the reductions in europe several military 
installations in the pacific are also on tap for closure the 
sources said 
cheney is slated to formally unveil the list on monday but 
officials have already begun notifying congressional delegations of 
the proposed shutdowns and changes congressional sources said 
sources warned that lastminute changes could be made given the 
volatile political nature of the suggested cuts 
among the other budget proposals expected in bushs fiscal 1991 
plan is production of five b2 stealth bombers last year congress 
approved funds for components for five of the radarevading 
aircraft in fiscal 1991 
the administration however will scale back the program which 
initially had the air force acquiring 132 bombers at a cost of 70 
billion sources said 
over a threeyear peak period for the bomber the pentagon 
proposed spending about 24 billion 78 billion in fiscal 1992 
84 billion in fiscal 1993 and 77 billion in fiscal 1994 
members of congress told pentagon officials last year that the 
likelihood of one program receiving that amount of money in a 
single year was slim 
a rancorous fight is expected on capitol hill over spending for 
the batwinged plane 
sources said they expect bush to continue spending for two 
landbased nuclear missiles the multiplewarhead railgarrison 
mx and the singlewarhead midgetman 
among the other budget proposals are cancellation of the m1 
tank after this year the marine corps v22 osprey tiltrotor 
aircraft and the apache helicopter 
the proposal also calls for mothballing the battleships uss iowa 
and the uss new jersey

premier hans modrow of east germany said 
today that his country wants to establish diplomatic relations with 
israel and is prepared to discuss reparations for nazi victims 
east germany has never had full diplomatic relations with israel 
because it refused to accept any responsibility for the holocaust 
but modrow told a news conference after meeting with austrian 
leaders that east germany had proposed negotiations on establishing 
ties 
there will probably be negotiations and the problem of 
reparation will be aired he told reporters asking about ties 
with israel now being revived throughout east europe as more 
liberal governments take over from orthdox communist regimes 
unlike west germany east germany has refused to pay reparations 
for nazi atrocities and confiscations claiming that its people 
constituted the antinazi resistance during the war and bore no 
responsibility for hitlers actions 
other eastern europe nations that had ties with israel broke 
them off after the 1967 arabisraeli war romania was the only 
nation with ties that refused to sever relations 
modrow spoke of the possibility of resuming ties with israel 
hours before paying a formal call on austrian president kurt 
waldheim who is criticized by israelis and jews worldwide for 
concealing his past as a soldier in the german army in the balkans 
in world war ii 
a panel of historians appointed by the austrian government 
issued a february 1988 report that presented no evidence to clearly 
back allegations waldheim committed atrocities but it said he was 
in close proximity to some nazi atrocities knew they were 
going on and made no attempt to prevent them 
modrow a respected communist reformer chosen to lead a 
provisional government after massive protests ousted the hardline 
regime last year faces serious problems at home 
a worsening economy the continued exodus of his citizens to the 
west and growing dissent among opposition groups have threatened 
the fragile stability of the country 
asked about his problems at home modrow refused to specify that 
he would quit the ruling communist party as some opposition groups 
have demanded 
the communists have promised to hold free elections on may 6 
modrow said he was prepared to discuss his position with the 
party once he has succeeded in building a coalition government that 
includes the opposition 
modrow also criticized the revamped communist party for being 
too slow in moving away from its stalinist past and the abuses of 
erich honeckers corrupt rule 
modrow who will visit moscow on tuesday for talks with soviet 
president mikhail s gorbachev faced a new crisis of confidence at 
home today following the announcement by one of the four small 
parties governing with the dominant communists that it will pull 
its three ministers out of the 27member cabinet 
the small christian democratic union said it made the move to 
indicate to the opposition and other parties that the three 
ministerial posts it held were free for distribution to any other 
group 
modrow said he shared that view and stressed that he was making 
a fair offer of a coalition to east germanys emerging 
opposition groups who are divided over whether to join any 
modrowled cabinet 
the east german premier held talks today with austrian 
chancellor franz vranitzky with the two agreeing to a threemonth 
experiment in lifting visa requirements for citizens of each 
country

the united states will close two of its 
four major military installations in greece political party 
leaders said today 
the disclosure came after leaders of the three parties that 
support the coalition government met with premier xenophon zolotas 
constantine mitsotakis leader of the conservative new democracy 
grouping confirmed a report by athens newspaper ethnos that us 
envoy to athens michael sotirhos advised the greeks on thursday of 
the us decision to shut the bases 
panhellenic socialist movement leader andreas papandreou told 
reporters that zolotas had discussed the us advisory at their 
meeting 
communist party chief harilaos florakis told reporters that if 
the bases were closed it would be a significant development 
the ethnos report said that sotirhos passed on a letter from 
us defense secretary richard cheney to his greek counterpart 
tzannis tzannetakis 
the letter said that hellinikon air base which is adjacent to 
athens international airport and the us navy communications 
station at nea makri 20 miles southeast of the capital would be 
removed 
the closure of the bases is considered part of the us 
pentagons plan to shut down dozens of military installations in 
the united states and abroad cheney is to present the pentagons 
defense budget proposal on monday in washington 
this would leave two other major military installations in 
greece a us air force communications monitoring post and a 
refueling base for the navys 6th fleet both are located on the 
island of crete 
the hellenikon air base which is used by reconnaisance aircraft 
to shadow soviet fleet movements in the mediterranean is also a 
support unit for us bases in turkey 
the nea makri station monitors telephone traffic in the 
mediterranean 
in addition to the four major installations there are 20 small 
us radar and communications stations spread throughout the 
country 
the bases were established in greece through a defense and 
cooperation agreement initialed in the mid1950s which also granted 
greece 350 million annually through military assistance programs 
a fiveyear agreement covering the bases expired in december 
1988 it gave the us 17 months to dismantle the bases if no new 
accord were reached 
parliament is to debate a conservativesocialist proposal next 
month calling for a sixmonth extension on the may 21 deadline to 
remove property personnel and materiel in order to give greekus 
negotiators more time 
after 17 rounds of fruitless negotiations both parties suspended 
talks before national elections last june a shortlived 
conservativecommunist coalition put the bases issue on hold 
officials in washington speaking on condition of anonymity 
said the decision to close hellenikon and nea makri is unrelated to 
the talks on renewing the lease for us bases in greece 
the greeks had demanded that any new defense accord include a 
guarantee of assistance in case of aggression by nato ally turkey 
which the us has been reluctant in providing

a sheriff is encouraging residents to buy 
illegal drugs and promising them up to 25 percent of any money or 
assets seized from dealers they help arrest 
i want people to realize they can make some really good money 
depending on how much they cooperate said anderson county 
sheriff gene taylor taylor who is putting some of his own money 
into a campaign to spread word about the program 
billboards scheduled to go up feb 2 will feature the slogan 
need cash turn in a dope dealer 
participants may either work as buyers who testify in court or 
as confidential informants although those who testify probably 
will be paid more taylor said 
security will be provided during drug transactions and 
informants wont face criminal charges for assisting in 
investigations 
theyll be watched closely he said an officer would be 
within seconds of them 
taylor said his six narcotics agents are swamped and he needs 
more help with drug cases 
the sheriffs program is modeled after one used by federal 
authorities that grant informants up to 25 percent of money or 
assets seized 
the billboard program is a joint venture between the sheriffs 
office and summey outdoor advertising inc the company is donating 
space on 15 billboards and taylor will spend 800 to 1000 of his 
own money for the signs that go on the billboards 
the sheriff said participants will be screened job and wont be 
paid until after the case has been cleared in court 
i realize this program wont appeal to the majority of people

wants to get involved 
the sheriff said he and tim ragen of the billboard company came 
up with the publicity idea after meeting thursday 
ragen who has been in anderson several months said he

who says chinese police dont like a good time 
the eve of lunar new year chinas biggest festival is the only 
day of the year that police are allowed to drink on the job 
those who patrol the streets around the beijing train station 
joined the rest of the population friday in saluting the year of 
the horse and commiserating on their hard lot 
people say we have no feelings thats an insult said zhao 
guangheng chief of the train station police district 
the requirements of our job are that we not show emotion and 
we are always busy so we dont have much time with people we are 
like thermoses the outside is cold and hard but inside is warm 
zhao after giving a rare interview on crimefighting in one of 
beijings most heavily policed districts invited foreign 
journalists to the stations lunar new year lunch and began passing 
around the white liquor 120proof firewater 
ordinarily police cant drink on the job he said after 
running from table to table to lift toasts even at home one can 
only drink a little it wouldnt do to get drunk 
most of the districts more than 200 police will be on duty 
throughout the fourday holiday weekend zhao said including 40 
who are undercover police 
a policemans life is a hard one all over the world he 
said with a sigh we cant spend too much time with our families 
what if a crime was committed while you were resting at home 
thats why the district decided to get its police together for a 
holiday lunch he said so everyone could display their warm 
feelings for a change during the lull between holiday crowds 
zhao said nearly 200000 travelers passed through the station 
each of the days leading up to friday en route to family reunions 
thats about double the normal passenger traffic 
on friday by contrast the station was so empty that uniformed 
and plainclothes police outnumbered travelers in the large lobby 
the next rush will come on monday and tuesday as holiday makers 
return home 
keeping illegal travelers out of beijing is one of the main 
duties of zhaos men and patrols on friday stopped passersby from 
time to time to check their identification chinese are required by 
law to carry a national id card that shows where they are 
registered to live and peasants seeking work in the city are 
quickly sent back home 
train station security was especially tight after june when the 
government crushed massive prodemocracy protests in beijing and 
other cities but zhang shuquan propaganda chief for the train 
district police station said police have relaxed their checks of 
passengers more recently 
a luggage xray machine that had been set up in the train 
stations entrance appeared to have been dismantled 
zhaos threeblock district which does not include inside the 
station arrests an average of 500 people each year he said 
the crime rate dropped last year and just four crimes have 
occurred so far this year all thefts one reason might be the 
citywide increase since june in patrols by plainclothes police 
as the party progressed a man in ordinary blue workmans 
clothes came in and sat down here is the head of our secret 
police zhao said 
the man nodded and smiled ive seen you around he told the

orders to us factories for durable goods 
rose for the second consecutive month in december the government 
said friday in a report analysts said indicates the sluggish 
manufacturing economy is stabilizing 
the commerce department said orders for durable goods 
bigticket items expected to last more than three years increased 
25 percent to a seasonally adjusted 1335 billion in december 
after gaining 49 percent in november 
but the manufacturing sluggishness through much of 1989 was 
reflected in the reports figures for the entire year while orders 
were up 59 percent to 152 trillion they advanced at their 
slowest pace since a 04 percent gain in 1986 orders increased 
109 percent in 1988 
the durable goods report says there is a weak economy but 
hints at a slight firming in the industrial sector said allen 
sinai chief economist for the boston co 
it manufacturing seems to be regaining its equilibrium 
agreed robert g dederick chief economist for the northern trust 
co in chicago it doesnt seem to be spiraling down into a 
recession 
sinai also noted the volatility of the durable goods reports and 
said the twomonth increase does not necessarily establish a trend 
the pace of orders in 1989 ranged from novembers 49 percent 
increase to a 45 percent decrease last may and often was affected 
by major onetime transportation and defense orders 
both dederick and sinai said the industrial economy remains weak 
and pointed out that if the transportation sector were excluded 
from the december report total orders would have been unchanged 
from november 
indeed the commerce department said the increase in orders last 
month was concentrated in the transportation sector up 87 percent 
to 399 billion after a 106 percent gain in november 
but this growth was in aircraft shipbuilding and tanks it 
explained which more than offset a decline in motor vehicles 
the automobile industry has been in a slump since sales 
incentives were removed when 1990model cars were introduced in 
october resulting in excessive inventories and widespread plant 
shutdowns 
new orders for nondefense capital goods often a barometer of 
business investment plants jumped 186 percent to 46 billion 
after gaining 79 percent in november 
the commerce department said the december increase was 
concentrated in the aircraft industry while the previous months 
was shared by all of the categories 
orders for electrical machinery rose 16 percent to 221 
billion after a 79 percent increase in november 
but orders for nonelectrical machinery including computers and 
a wide variety of industrial equipment slipped 43 percent to 
217 billion after a 58 percent increase in november 
primary metals orders also were off down 29 percent to 109 
billion after a 22 percent gain the previous month 
new orders for defense capital goods declined 292 percent to 
81 billion after gaining 189 percent in november excluding 
defense orders would have risen 55 percent 
shipments of durable goods in december slipped 02 percent to 
1229 billion after rising 11 percent in november

vice president dumitru mazilu resigned 
today and cited stalinist methods he said are being used by the 
governing national salvation front 
taking into account with profound sorrow and deep distress 
that the stalinist methods and practices are maintained i 
resign from my position which as you may remember i stated from 
the first day that i did not want mazilu said 
mazilu who once was a colonel in nicolae ceausescus dreaded 
secret police force fell from favor in the government after 
writing a report for a un commission that described 
nightmarish conditions in romania 
he became one of ceausescus most outspoken critics during the 
december revolution that led to the dictators ouster 
i am convinced that those who have carried out the revolution 
will never accept that it be taken over by people who havent given 
anything of themselves to it mazilu said 
wholeheartedly i remain on the peoples side i shall forever 
remain devoted to democracy freedom and ideals of dignity which 
have inspired the youth of the country in its fight against 
tyranny he said 
i shall never forget their sacrifices 
critics have demanded that the entire national salvation front 
step down in large part because of its decision to compete in 
national elections in may 
opponents say the front cannot fairly take part in an election 
that it also administers and some fear the front wants a return to 
oneparty rule in romania 
the front has been governing romania by decree since ceausescu 
was overthrown dec 22 
on thursday night the front president ion lliescu went on 
national television to defend the governing body against growing 
criticism 
he denied it did anything wrong in deciding to compete in the 
elections may 20 and added it would have been absurd for the 
front as the engine of national stabilization and recovery not to 
participate in the elections 
in an indication of the power struggle romania faces in coming 
months iliescu accused three revived political parties of 
irresponsibility for demanding the front stop governing if it 
enters the elections 
iliescu also countered complaints about communist holdovers in 
the new leadership by charging that unidentified figures in some 
emerging political parties and some biting journalists had also 
been communists 
virtually every professional in romania had to be a party member 
to hold any rank in ceausescus time thus many journalists and 
government figures who are prominent now were once communists 
for all its weakness and shortcomings the national salvation 
front is the only structure very frail still that bears the 
brunt iliescu said the collapse of this structure means 
pushing the country into chaos 
senior communists who fell from ceausescus favor to become 
prominent in the front include iliescu mazilu and foreign affairs 
expert silviu brucan 
the front also includes noncommunists 
hundreds of people demonstrated against the front outside its 
headquarters in bucharest on wednesday and thursday before being 
dispersed by soldiers and police no injuries were reported but 
the front responded by restating its jan 3 decree outlawing street 
protests unless authorized by police 
on jan 12 an angry mob chanted death to the communists 
outside the front headquarters prompting iliescu to outlaw the 
communist party but he retracted that decision 
during the jan 12 protest mazilu joined in the anticommunist 
chants and came under fire from some front members because of it 
mazilu got in trouble with the ceausescu regime when he was 
asked by the un commission on human rights in geneva in 1986 to 
write a report on human rights and youth 
he was never allowed back to switzerland from romania his 
report which almost exclusively focused on what he termed 
nightmarish conditions in romania was smuggled out and made 
public in geneva last august 
when his past as a secret police colonel was disclosed in a 
newspaper report after the revolution mazilu ignored calls for his 
resignation and was defended by other front leaders 
in another development today manea manescu a former ceausescu 
associate facing trial said in an interview that he was only a 
simple executioner of orders and regretted he had not tried to 
prevent the thousands of deaths in last months revolution 
manescu was a member of the ruling politburo under ceausescu 
he said the dictator would never have surrendered power 
peacefully and added that the revolution by the romanian people 
led by generous and courageous youth was the only alternative to 
the tyranny of the two in reference to the dictator and his 
wife elena 
the two were executed by firing squad dec 25 after a military 
tribunal convicted them of genocide and ruining the nations 
economy 
manescus trial is scheduled to begin saturday

common scents has convinced several students at 
post oak school in houston that they need to recycle 
six students have been carrying around trash bags filled with 
their own garbage for a week as part of a science project designed 
to illustrate the growing solid waste crisis 
some were surprised at the load of trash they have accumulated 
seventhgrader carlin brady 13 said thursday that her 
cumbersome load is filled with everything not good for you or the 
environment im surprised at how much trash one person can collect 
in one weekend 
students at the private school began the experiment last 
saturday to kick off a symposium this weekend at the suburban 
bellaire civic center called so you want to recycle 
miss brady said she doesnt mind explaining why shes carrying 
the bag because it reminds people to recycle but she admits 
that she didnt socialize much over the weekend 
for those who did want to go out somewhere where a reeking bag 
of trash would be socially unacceptable one could carry a small 
environmentally acceptable brown bag 
when asked who had the stinkiest bag the students quickly 
replied anthony 
yes i will be glad to get rid of it anthony tunis 12 
said shyly 
theres a lot of stuff that can be recycled for money he 
said and we need to so we can save the planet

a mock claim that french engineer 
alexandre gustave eiffel stole the idea for his paris tower from a 
structure in san jose has been rejected by a judge 
the justforfun legal debate city of san jose vs paris 
probably failed to appease civic boosters in san jose 
in his decision thursday justice marcel poche refused to rule 
if eiffel who was denounced as a crook plagiarized the design of 
san joses 208foot high electric light tower which was passed off 
as resembling a clowns hat 
poche diplomatically ruled at the court of historical inquiry 
that the case boils down to a situation where two creative 
individuals thousands of miles apart had similar ideas at about 
the same time 
at issue was whether the 984foot tall eiffel tower erected for 
the international exhibitin of 1889 imitated san joses beacon 
of the west built eight years before the symbol of paris 
san joses representative dean gerald f uelmen of the santa 
clara university school of law alleged that the eiffel tower is a 
flimsy imitation of the san jose tower built by jj owen in 
1881 
paris representative local attorney jacques dulin retorted 
that he was shocked at the gall of san jose and mocked its 
towers poor clowns hat of a design 
the ruling ended the fourth session of the court which 
addresses controversies involving people and events of the past 
producing often obscure and interesting historical detail 
of course despite the mudslinging all parties have fun along 
the way

dramatizing his point by helping install a 
high efficiency lighting fixture a top bush administration energy 
official friday outlined energy conservation initiatives he said 
could save 32 billion by the year 2000 
americans are not wasteful by nature w henson moore 
deputy secretary of energy told a news conference the record is 
good but the record is not good enough 
moore said the initiatives being announced required an 
investment of 336 million in the next six years including 30 
million shifted from other energy department programs this year 
the programs range from the use of more efficient lighting 
fixtures to exploring possible development of unused hydroelectric 
capacity at existing dam sites 
moore helped an electrician charles jones replace a part in a 
flourescent lighting fixture one of 36 in the room where the news 
conference was held 
he said it would increase the efficiency of the fixture by 25 
percent reducing its cost by 650 a year 
the initiatives outlined at the news conference concentrate on 
increasing energy efficiency and using renewable energy resources 
using energy more efficiently under these initiatives will 
also avoid damage to the environment by an estimated 800 million 
tons of carbon dioxide 23 million tons of sulphur oxides and 21 
million tons of nitrogen oxides annually moore said 
moore said federal engineers and design specialists will 
identify federal buildings to refit with more advanced lighting 
technologies 
he said the department would also explore ways to make it as 
profitable for electrical utilities to increase efficiency as to 
expand their capacity 
the department will encourage states and localities to adopt the 
voluntary interim standards the department has formulated for 
residential and commercial buildings moore said 
he said the department will establish three new energy analysis 
and diagnostic centers per year at engineering schools until it has 
increased the current 13 centers to 40 
the department also plans joint ventures with industry to 
demonstate advanced technologies for producing energy from waste 
the deputy secretary said 
a cooperative program with industry will be undertaken to 
reduce the time required to transfer technology from the research 
laboratory to the private sector from 10 to six years he said 
he said the department would work with the department of 
agrigculture and private companies in an effort to make ethanol 
fuels from nonfood feedstocks a competitive alternative fuel by 
the year 2000 
the department will speed up testing of a prototype for using 
concentrated solar energy to break down toxic chemicals into 
harmless byproducts in compliance with environmental standards he 
said 
also part of the program is development of a laboratory for 
solar heat and other technologies in a governmentowned building at 
the departments solar energy research institute in golden colo

the navy tried to cover up wrongdoing in 
the drowning of a recruit the victims family charged in one of 
two lawsuits seeking a total of 7 million from the government 
the lawsuits filed thursday in us district court stem from 
the 1988 death of airman recruit lee mirecki 19 of appleton 
wis during a rescue drill at pensacola naval air station 
mireckis mother elaine kitowski is seeking 5 million for 
wrongful death in one lawsuit in the other she is joined by 
mireckis two sisters and a brother in asking 2 million for severe 
emotional distress suffered allegedly because the navy initially 
covered up wrongdoing by instructors 
kay esty a spokeswoman for the naval education and training 
command headquartered in pensacola said it would be inappropriate 
for the navy to comment 
in 1989 the family filed a 20 million administrative claim 
against the navy a required preliminary step before going to 
court the navy has neither accepted nor rejected the claim so the 
family took the inaction as a denial the lawsuits state 
mirecki suffered fearinduced heart failure before drowning in a 
swimming pool during training to become a rescue swimmer according 
to courtmartial testimony rescue swimmers jump from helicopters 
to aid downed fliers 
one instructor petty officer 2nd class michael comb of tucson 
ariz was convicted of negligent homicide for forcing mireckis 
head under water he was sentenced to 90 days in the brig 
at a separate courtmartial lt thomas torchia of princeton 
ill the officer in charge of the navy rescue swimmer school was 
acquitted of dereliction of duty in the march 2 1988 incident 
four other enlisted instructors received fines and reductions in 
rank for allegedly forcing mirecki back into the pool after he had 
climbed out shouting that he wanted to quit the voluntary training 
program 
during the courtsmartial students testified they were ordered 
to face away and sing the national anthem while comb dunked mirecki 
relatives contend it was their persistence in questioning the 
circumstances of the death that led to investigations that 
confirmed it was not accidental the navy has denied any coverup

on its surface the sundance united 
states film festival is a laidback celebration of creative cinema 
but underneath the merriment lurks highstakes dealing 
winning and the momentum it generates can spell the difference 
between obscurity and worldwide fame 
the main intention of this festival isnt to get films sold 
but to showcase the best new independently made american films 
said festival director tony safford 
but it doesnt always work out that way selling is crucial 
after taking the top prize last year for sex lies and 
videotape steve soderbergh returned to park city this week to 
find that the landscape was changing independent movies were 
sparking the interest of accountants not just film enthusiasts 
im a little concerned by what sex lies might have wrought 
here soderbergh said that this can become more of a film 
market than a film festival 
sex lies and videotape costing 11 million has made more 
than 24 million for miramax films roger amp me a documentary 
costing 160000 has collected 23 million so far for warner 
bros with returns like that its not surprising that major 
studios are more interested than ever in snapping up distribution 
rights to independently made movies 
its a very complicated business right now because a lot of 
the independent distributors have gone out of business said 
caldecot chubb coproducer of to sleep with anger debuting 
here 
warner bros universal and 20th century fox all say they want 
to release 30 movies a year chubb said where are they going 
to get those films 
chubb is hopeful theyll come to him to sleep with anger 
starring danny glover is looking for a distributor 
the distribution problem is complicated by the success of a few 
booming independents like miramax and new line cinema 
films those companies would have picked up two or three years 
ago are now too small for them said michael spielberg president 
of newcomer monument pictures 
some who come to the festival arent interested in sales at all 
due to its prohunting tone the only way writerdirector george 
butler could distribute his documentary in the blood was by 
doing it himself 
i had a tremendously difficult time making this movie 
butler said the prejudice against hunting is so powerful in the 
film industry 
five years in the making in the blood was financed by and 
will be distributed through the contributions of 20 investors 
including the huntingwetland preservation group ducks unlimited

the supreme court is being choosier about what 
cases it reviews and as a result the justices wont be on the 
bench as much this spring 
an oral argument schedule for march released friday shows 16 
hours of sessions rather than the usual 24 
the argument sessions the publics only opportunity to see the 
court at work usually are conducted six days each month for four 
hours a day each case is allotted one hour 
the march argument schedule features four threehour days and 
two hours on each of two remaining days 
in the past some justices have complained about trying to 
squeeze too much work into the courts ninemonth terms 
chief justice william h rehnquist in a recent speech said a 
1988 law that gave the court greater discretion over the cases it 
chooses to review is having a very beneficial impact on the 
courts selection of cases 
unless the court takes the unlikely step of giving expedited 
review to some cases in the interim the april schedule also will 
be an abbreviated one with about the same number of cases argued 
as in march 
cases granted review from now through the end of the current 
term will be argued in the term that begins next october 
the court in recent years granted review in about 150 of the 
some 5000 cases reaching it annually at its current pace the 
court is likely to grant substantially fewer cases in its current 
term 
arguments in granted cases are conducted from october through 
april the court generally announces decisions in each case argued 
during those months before taking its summer recess in late june or 
early july

formal disciplinary charges have been 
lodged against two lutheran congregations that violated church 
policy by ordaining three gay ministers who have refused to 
renounce sexual relations 
st francis and first united congregations face punishment 
ranging from censure to expulsion from the evangelical lutheran 
church in american for willfully disregarding membership 
requirements 
the organization the largest american lutheran denomination 
bans ordination of selfavowed practicing homosexuals the 
congregations have said they are prepared to accept expulsion 
all three ministers who were hired in november by their 
congregations were removed from a list of ordainable clergy after 
they refused to agree to celibacy the practice is often required 
of known homosexual pastors but not of heterosexual ones in the 
lutheran tradition 
jeff johnson 27 was ordained saturday as assistant pastor at 
first united a working class congregation with no acknowledged 
homosexual members also saturday ruth frost 42 and phyllis 
zillhart 32 were ordained at st francis near the predominantly 
gay castro neighborhood 
we find ourselves in a very unpleasant situation forced upon 
us by circumstance said synod bishop lyle miller in a statement 
issued friday he had warned the congregations they faced possible 
expulsion 
i very much support our churchs ministry to and with gay and 
lesbian people i have strived to maintain a pastoral relationship 
with these two congregations and continue to care for them he 
added 
a consultation team of three pastors and two lay people will be 
named to meet with the congregations if the group cannot resolve 
the dispute a 12member disciplinary committee will review the 
charges 
the rev john frykman of first united said last week both 
congregations are prepared to accept expulsion if necessary 
we see this as what god is asking us to do he said our 
congregation felt this was a social justice issue that gays are 
part of the rainbow coalition of gods creation 
the dissident congregations have received support from some 
members and clergy in the 52 millionmember lutheran organization 
formed by the merger of three smaller groups in 1988 
lutheran churches in some northern european countries have 
ordained socalled active homosexual ministers with approval from 
denomination leaders

president bush will propose a 246 billion 
education budget for 1991 on monday that bolsters math and science 
initiatives while cutting the biggest loan program for college 
students an official familiar with the plan said 
the proposal in an area bush has called one of his priorities 
represents a 500 million increase over this years spending levels 
about half of what would be needed to keep abreast of inflation 
the president will call for 18 billion in increases over 1990 
levels in some programs and 13 billion in cuts in others for a 
net increase of 500 million the official said on thursday the 
plan will be part of the 123 trillion budget for fiscal 1991 
which begins oct 1 bush unveils on monday 
the spending blueprint drew sour reviews friday from several 
education lobbyists who complained that the increases did not go 
far enough and that the cuts should not be made 
overall its an inadequate investment said gerald morris 
deputy director of legislation for the american federation of 
teachers the nations secondlargest teachers union we think 
education in a lot of respects has been bled dry 
among the victims of bushs cuts will be the guaranteed student 
loan program which will be pared by 500 million to a level of 
33 billion the program made 37 million loans to undergraduate 
and graduate students last year making it the governments biggest 
student loan effort 
another 155 million will be slashed from the perkins loan 
program for lowincome college students and 60 million more will 
be saved by eliminating federal grants that help states run their 
own studentaid efforts 
the cuts angered becky timmons director of congressional 
liaison for the american council on education which represents 
colleges and universities 
in my view thats a step back to the time when only the sons 
and daughters of the privileged were encouraged to attend 
college she said 
bush will also propose scaling back federal assistance to 
libraries from 140 million to 40 million 
two other programs for lowincome students will be increased 
bush will ask lawmakers to increase the pell grants program 
which provides money to lowincome college students by 473 
million over the current 48 billion enough to keep pace with 
inflation because the grants are financed in advance the increase 
covers the school year that begins in the fall of 1991 
but the budget will also say that because of acrosstheboard 
cuts included in this years budget the pell grants program will 
be cut next fall by 665 million the official said the document 
will state that as a result about 14000 students receiving awards 
averaging 200 will lose their grants and 13 million other 
students will have their stipends cut by 50 
the proposal will ask for 230 million 100 million more than 
this year for math and science programs 
a 350 million increase will be sought for socalled chapter one 
programs which provide assistance to lowincome public and private 
school students raising that spending to 58 billion the source 
said 
bush will renew his past proposals to spend 100 million for 
magnet schools and another 225 million for schools that show 
improved student performance no drug problems and lower dropout 
rates 
other increases will include a 50 million increase to 590 
million for drug prevention and antiabuse programs and an 80 
million increase to 21 billion for handicapped student aid 
the president will also seek a 50 million increase to 240 
million for adult education and literacy initiatives near 
doubling from 95 million to 175 million of efforts to analyze 
the adequacy of education programs and 70 million more for the 
education departments management budget bringing it to 400 
million 
he will also ask for 25 million to train principals and 20 
million to assess the results of the meeting bush held last 
september with the nations governors to discuss education problems

east germanys splintered prodemocracy 
groups agreed friday to form a government with embattled communist 
premier hans modrow on the condition that all cabinet members 
renounce their party loyalties 
the surprise show of unity among the fractious political groups 
followed the announcement by christian democrats that they were 
pulling out of modrows 27member cabinet presumably to distance 
themselves from the distrusted communists and boost their election 
chances 
east germanys christian democratic union is one of four small 
parties that stood by the communists through their 40year monopoly 
on power 
one of the conditions set by the prodemocracy groups currently 
unrepresented in the government was that the officially recognized 
small parties join the coalition as well 
reform movements such as new forum and democratic awakening do 
not want the official parties to escape responsibility for the 
disastrous state of the east german economy 
in announcing the agreement to join modrows interim government 
wolfgang ullmann of the democracy now movement said the various 
opposition forces would take part only if all cabinet members 
agreed to give up their political affiliations until the may 6 
elections 
ullmann said modrow had been informed of their decision and was 
willing to meet with the groups on sunday to discuss details of 
which ministries might be offered to the new groups 
it was not immediately clear whether modrow or the other 
ministers are willing to renounce their party affiliations as 
demanded by the reform activists 
nor did the christian democrats indicate whether they would 
rejoin modrow although a show of solidarity would be likely if the 
other obstacles to a grand coalition can be overcome 
west german politicians from chancellor helmut kohls party had 
praised the christian democrats decision to leave the east german 
leadership as a clear break with its communistaligned past 
until recent days modrow had enjoyed bonns endorsement as a 
caretaker leader pending the nations firstever free elections 
but west germans have become increasingly concerned about the 
hopeless outlook for east german recovery that is driving 2000 
east germans to the west each day 
conservative politicians such as kohl now appear eager to help 
an alternative force gain strength in east germany 
the many prodemocracy groups have proven themselves too 
unorganized to mount a serious campaign challenge leaving many 
voters fearful the communists could retain the leadership after the 
elections 
the christian democrats resigned its three ministerial posts 
effective feb 9 pressuring modrow to build a new government by 
then that would include the prodemocracy groups 
the opposition politicians insisted their parties be given 
ministerial seats in order to gain experience in governing and to 
influence decisions that will affect the nations future 
some groups opposed entering the government on the grounds that 
their participation could open them to blame for the nations 
daunting problems but after more than eight hours of negotiations 
friday ullmann announced the parties had forged a united strategy 
modrow a relatively respected communist reformer was chosen to 
lead after massive protests ousted the hardline regime last year 
but a worsening economy and the continued exodus of his people has 
brought a resurgence in dissent 
the decision by deputy premier lothar de maiziere and two fellow 
christian democrats to pull out of modrows government was 
portrayed by the party as a way to allow the newer opposition 
groups to join the government 
but the pullout also allowed the christian democrats to flee a 
sinking communist ship 
steffen reiche whose social democratic party has no 
representation in the government called the christian democrats 
departure the crowning irresponsibility of its 40year service 
reiche was quoted by the official adn news agency as saying his 
party would not accept cabinet posts unless the christian democrats 
did likewise 
in vienna friday for meetings with austrian officials modrow 
told reporters he was making a fair offer of a coalition to 
east germanys opposition groups 
modrow also seeming to distance himself from the party 
criticized the communist party for being too slow in moving away 
from its stalinist past and the abuses of erich honeckers corrupt 
rule 
communists now hold 16 ministerial posts the liberal democrats 
four the christian democrats three and the national democrats and 
farmers party two each

the government that took over when the dictator nicolae ceause ap vice 
prescu 
was deposed and executed 
mazilu who had been under pressure to quit because of ties he 
once had to to ceausescu made the announcement on radio free 
europe 
also thursday manea manescu one of the four ceausescu henchmen 
facing trial saturday said in an interview he was only a simple 
executioner of orders 
manescu expressed regrets that he did not try to prevent the 
thousands of deaths in the uprising that ousted ceausescu on dec 
22 
ion iliescu president of the provisional government has

media and a proposed electoral law with representatives of the 15 
new and revived parties planning to contest the elections

more than 300 students defied a ban on protests for a second 
night friday and demonstrated outside front headquarters demanding 
the resignation of its leadership a double line of tanks and 
soldiers blocked their path to the the building the former foreign 
ministry on victory square 
mazilu telephoned radio free europe and read this statement of 
resignation 
taking account with profound sorrow and deep distress that the 
stalinist methods and practices are maintained that label are 
being still used based on security files and accusations imposed 
under threat that the press is still directed to destroy some 
people and promote others i resign from my position which as you 
may remember i stated from the first day that i did not want 
i am convinced that those who have carried out the revolution 
will never accept that it be taken over by people who havent given 
anything of themselves to it 
wholeheartedly i remain on the peoples side i shall forever 
remain devoted to democracy freedom and ideals of dignity which 
have inspired the youth of the country in its fight against 
tyranny i shall never forget their sacrifices 
in 1986 mazilu was asked by the un commission on human rights 
in geneva of which he was a member to write a report on human 
rights and youth in romania 
he was never allowed to return to switzerland his report 
focusing on what he termed nightmarish conditions in romania 
was smuggled out and made public in geneva last august 
when his past as a colonel in ceausescus securitate secret 
police was disclosed in a newspaper report after the revolution 
mazilu ignored calls for his resignation and was defended by other 
front leaders

deposed panamanian dictator manuel noriega claimed 
status as a prisoner of war under the geneva convention and asked 
today to be moved to a neutral third country to avoid trial on us 
drug charges 
the claim was mailed to president bush in a letter signed by 
noriega who listed his title as commanderinchief of the 
panamanian defense force a copy was contained in a motion filed in 
federal court by defense attorney frank rubino 
rejecting the courts jurisdiction rubino said he would 
respectfully decline to participate in a scheduled pretrial 
detention hearing but us district judge william hoeveler ordered 
the hearing to continue as expected he denied bond ruling that 
the defense had not rebutted the prosecutions contention that 
noriega might flee the country if freed on bail 
the hearing opened with noriega appearing in uniform and rubino 
reading his motion into the court record 
the defense contended noreiga who was whisked out of panama on 
jan 3 to face a 1988 drug indictment in miami was a political 
prisoner captured as the result of an illegal military invasion in 
violation of international conventions treaties and accords 
the motion recounted events leading up to noriegas arrest 
outside the papal nunciature in panama city including american 
troops use of highintensity lights and loudspeakers playing rock 
n roll music 
the judge acknowledged receipt of the motion but called it 
untimely and said he would give the prosecution time to respond 
the government not the defense demanded the bond hearing 
concerned that failure to guarantee noriega the opportunity could 
jeopardize their case in both the legal and political arenas 
rubino refused to ask for bond because noriega does not 
recognize us jurisdiction and he said earlier because i dont 
file motions i dont expect to win 
a noriega codefendant won a small victory thursday when a 
federal judge refused to order an immediate trial in a parallel 
indictment 
brian alden davidow was one of 15 people accused of cocaine 
trafficking in february 1988 along with noriega he also was 
indicted in a second case the same day 
after two years of delays in the second indictment assistant 
us attorney barbara schwartz on thursday asked for an immediate 
trial for davidow over the objections of his attorney richard 
sharpstein 
i think theyre using this tool for leverage to make us more 
amenable to plea bargaining sharpstein told chief us district 
judge james l king 
the judge said he was surprised by the us attorneys decision 
to go ahead with the trial and ms schwartzs contention it would 
take only a few days the judge said the original prosecutor told 
him the case would be complex 
i was told it would be a preview of the noriega case with the 
same witnesses and the same evidence king said 
the judge delayed davidows trial for several weeks until it was 
clear whether noriegas trial would take place as scheduled march 
5 and whether davidows case would be separated from the larger 
trial 
meanwhile defense attorneys continued a barrage of motions 
aimed at forcing the government to turn over documents to be used 
against the noriega defendants 
an attorney for noriega codefendant daniel miranda a pilot 
accused of flying laundered drug profits has filed a separate 
motion asking that hoeveler appoint an independent caretaker for 
evidence seized during last months invasion of panama 
there have been reports of almost 50 tons of documents seized 
by the united states wrote attorney michael okane the 
government has shown that it cannot act responsibly to preserve 
these documents 
and an attorney for another codefendant former noriega aide 
and accused moneylaunderer luis del cid has filed papers 
demanding immediate access to the evidence the government used in 
the original february 1988 drugtrafficking indictment 
prosecutors have sought to delay handing over evidence arguing 
investigators must sift through thousands of documents seized 
during the invasion of panama but del cids lawyer samuel burstyn 
rejected that explanation 
the fact that the government may develop further evidence 
which it would have a duty to tender in no way suspends its duty to 
furnish to the defense evidence that it already has in its 
possession burstyn wrote 
the us attorneys office refuses to comment on the motions 
until court hearings said spokeswoman diane cossin

citizens angry about decades of environmental 
abuse forced authorities to curb imports of west german waste 
friday and reassess east germanys policy of accepting foreign 
garbage in return for hard currency 
since taking office two weeks ago environment minister peter 
diederich had promised to cut the waste trade that he said has 
netted the nation nearly 590 million in badly needed foreign 
exchange in the past 15 years 
but the governments hand was forced after area residents 
thursday blocked sites at schoeneiche and vorketzin south of 
berlin in east germany where west berlin and west germany dump 
more than 1 million tons of garbage annually 
west german environmentalists say about 100000 tons of 
dangerous waste discarded each year for a decade have polluted 
groundwater at both landfills where practically no ecological 
precautions have been taken 
diederich has called for vorketzin to be closed but denied there 
is any danger for humans 
east germany which previously knew virtually no environmental 
protest was a discreet dumping ground for everrising mountains of 
garbage from highly industrialized west germany 
but since last falls peaceful democratic revolution east 
germans have started railing against evidence of widespread 
pollution damage wrought under 40 years of communist rule 
that makes statesponsored garbage tourism a rising problem 
for both germanys at a time when they are working on evercloser 
ties 
east germany cannot continue to offer garbage disposal for 
other countries as it has in the past said berthold goeke a 
west german environment ministry spokesman 
that will increase the pressure on us he said by telephone 
from bonn 
fridays east german measures included an indefinite ban on west 
berlin shipments of toxic waste which includes paints solvents 
oils and asbestoslaced cement that the city is gradually scrapping 
also barred were west german exports of industrial and sewage 
sludge the staterun news agency adn said diederich urged the 
foreign trade ministry to renegotiate the agreement governing that 
trade 
west berlin an urban island in the midst of east germany 
trucks most of its waste to the surrounding countryside the 
business is regulated by a 20year contract running through 1994 
since east germany opened the berlin wall on nov 9 officials 
from both sides of the city have launched talks on a costly dump 
cleanup and new ways to distribute west berlins garbage 
west germany and west berlin account for more than 80 percent of 
east german garbage imports totaling 55 million tons a year 
according to diederich 
east germany also solicited dangerous waste from switzerland 
austria the netherlands and italy 
for example switzerland which has tough environmental laws 
has trucked hundreds of tons of spent household batteries to east 
germany annually the batteries usually contain dangerous heavy 
metals such as mercury and zinc 
but the money east germany made seems likely to be dwarfed by 
the cost of any comprehensive cleanup and damage awards that 
citizens have begun demanding 
diederichs predecessor in the communistled cabinet hans 
reichelt quit jan 9 citing his age of 65 reichelt had been 
widely accused of failing to resist policies that have turned east 
germany into one of eastern europes most polluted countries 
on friday diederich announced the international environmental 
group greenpeace has been given official approval to begin work in 
east germany 
a government commission called for five heavily polluting 
enterprises in the leipzig area to be shut down by december 1991 
three years ahead of schedule

aluminum steel and wires he said 
race a new york city paramedic and volunteer member of the 
oyster bay fire company spooned soup from a foam cup and munched 
cookies after his exhausting night he stood in the rain in his 
docksiders because he didnt have time to put on his firemans

were trained to prepare for the worst but my first reaction 
was that this was a dream race said 
i think it was a miracle for anybody on the plane to be 
alive said race hero everybody who was there was a hero 
the plane crashed in a secluded hamlet of 400 residents that 
covers three square miles on oyster bay harbor which is part of

race we couldnt get the live people out because they were 
buried under the dead people

into an embankment 
most of the passengers were still buckled in their seats but 
race said one womans seat was thrown from the plane and perched on 
top the orange and white fuselage while another woman had to 
pulled down from a tree 
the airplane lay in three pieces the cockpit section had broken 
off the deck on sam tissenbaums home and the tail section lay 
across the road just 100 yards from rick robinsons two story green 
cottage 
robinson 53 was watching the dave thomas comedy show on 
television with his 79yearold mother when he heard a disturbance 
and went out to investigate 
it was a scraping noise like a tree falling or a snowplow 
dragging along the road i didnt hear any engine noise said 
robinson a sports writer for the oyster bay guardian 
he returned to the house for a flashlight without realizing what 
had happened 
a wire burst into flame and i could see the outline of the 
plane i could just hear them feebly crying for help said 
robinson its amazing it didnt explode it just crumpled its 
shocking how close it came to my house

president bush asked the nations mayors to 
support his new antidrug strategy friday but urban leaders voiced 
strong disagreement with his answers for drugs and other urban 
problems 
bush appealed to the us conference of mayors one day after 
presenting his revised plan for fighting drugs which adds 11 
billion in federal spending but was criticized by mayors as too 
little 
i ask you to support our strategy to take back the streets 
from crime and drugs bush said 
bush offered the mayors no specifics and no new initiatives on 
urban problems beyond the second phase of his drug program outlined 
a day earlier he repeated his call for more private efforts 
saying americans are willing to help and pledged to use his 
bully pulpit to ask for volunteers 
lets join hands to inspire the millions of americans who want 
to help america get clean and stay clean he said together 
lets defeat public enemy no 1 
bushs appearance at the conclusion of the bigcity mayors 
annual winter meeting was the first time an incumbent president has 
spoken to the overwhelmingly democratic group since jimmy carter in 
1980 
mayors interviewed after the speech said they appreciated the 
symbolic support his appearance provided but that he had offered 
the cities little 
we certainly appreciate the fact the president showed up here 
today said boston mayor raymond l flynn a democrat i think 
there is strong disagreement as to how to proceed to address some 
of the issues of urban america that have been ignored for such a 
long period of time 
mayor kathyrn whitmire of houston president of the conference 
and the elected leader of bushs adopted hometown said the size of 
bushs drug proposal 106 billion was too small 
we have not yet seen a level of commitment in line with the 
size of the problem she said 
whitmire was invited by bush to spend friday night at the white 
house and she said she hoped to use the opportunity to discuss her 
objections to the drug plan 
whitmire a democrat said she was pleased bush addressed 
urban problems in his speech and said it suggested his 
administration would be more receptive to the mayors than president 
reagan was 
i think his presence here indicates a little more willinginess 
to discuss those disagreements and see if something can be worked 
out she said 
besides the size of the drug program she said mayors object to 
the administrations insistence on routing aid to local governments 
through state governments which mayors say dont pass along the 
full amount she also said mayors want a commitment from bush to 
provide enough money so that any drug abuser needing treatment can 
receive it 
bush told the mayors his drug proposal for education treatment 
interdiction and enforcement amounted to a 41 percent increase in 
outlays over the current year and means a 69 percent increase in 
drugrelated spending overall since our administration took 
office 
whitmire however said the increase is there but it is much 
smaller generally below 10 percent 
i like what he said about education said mayor karen vialle 
of tacoma wash but we need the bucks to do it 
the mayors meeting ended with some of the first indirect 
criticism of housing and urban development secretary jack kemp 
thats been heard in public meetings of urban officials kemp the 
former professional football player and congressman was invited 
but did not attend the threeday meeting because he was attending 
super bowlrelated events said j thomas cochrane executive 
director of the conference of mayors 
several of kemps assistants engaged in a sometimes contentious 
debate with members of the mayors housing and community 
development committee 
mayor jessie m rattley of newport news va chairman of that 
panel said later that the mayors were told by the hud officials 
that mayors are really the cause of the problem in some of the 
scandalplagued agencys programs and that new accounting 
procedures in one program were to make the mayors accountable 
as one mayor im unwilling to accept that accusation 
rattley said

polands beleaguered communists begin a 
party congress saturday at which they are expected to change their 
name shed the old ideology and declare themselves champions of 
parliamentary democracy 
they also intend to choose new leaders they hope can mold the 
new incarnation into the main leftwing party of polands new 
political spectrum 
about 1600 delegates will attend the 11th congress of the 
party which ruled poland from its founding in 1948 until the 
government of prime minister tadeusz mazowiecki led by solidarity 
took over last year 
the congress will continue at least until monday and insiders 
say the party is in such disarray it is difficult to predict what 
will happen 
politburo member janusz reykowski said no one in the party 
advocates a split but it is possible either orthodox communists or 
extreme liberals may bolt and form their own group 
reykowski said in an interrview thursday the party now claims 2 
million members but the new party will be much smaller 
it is a necessity to lose a great majority of the members 
he said it is inevitable the problem is rather what kind of 
people remain whether those who remain are based on the old guard 
or are those oriented toward a completely new way of political 
activity 
solidarity leader lech walesa and communist members of 
parliament have expressed support for tadeusz fiszbach as leader of 
the new party he is a former party chief in gdansk walesas 
hometown who was dismissed because he opposed the imposition of 
martial law in december 1981 
mieczyslaw f rakowski the current leader said early in 
january he would be a candidate but he appeared to be 
reconsidering this week because of arguments that only new 
leadership will give the party a chance 
when asked at a news conference friday whether he would seek the 
job he replied i dont have the answer to this question today 
reykowski the politburo member said neither rakowski nor 
fiszbach would be chosen if delegates felt the time had come for a 
clear generational change 
possible candidates from the new generation are slawomir wiatr 
founder of a liberal party faction called the 8th of july movement 
and leszek miller a rakowski loyalist and party secretary 
the communist party formally named the polish united workers 
party was created by a forced merger in stalins days of the 
polish workers party and the polish socialist party a leftwing 
group founded in the 19th century that enjoyed broad support 
between the world wars 
now the party says it wants to shed its communist identity and 
become a party of social democrats in the old socialist tradition 
a draft policy declaration to be presented to the congress 
harshly criticizes the past 
it finds the party guilty of crimes committed during 
stalinism departing from democratic principles conflicts with the 
working class the impoverishment of the intelligentsia and the 
present economic and social crisis 
on the other hand it defends the patriotism and honest 
commitment of millions of party members and says stalinism was 
imposed at a time of limited state sovereignty shorthand for 
soviet domination in the 1940s and 1950s 
the communists sources of strength and ability to regain 
popular trust have dwindled to the point of exhaustion the 
resolution says the time has come to build a new party of the 
left 
names being considered are socialist party of poland socialist 
party of working people social democratic party of poland polish 
party of working people polish party of the socialist left and 
polish labor party 
parliamentary elections in june were an overwhelming victory for 
solidarity demonstrating the partys lack of popularity 
not one of the 100 freely contested senate seats went to a party 
candidate senior party leaders running unopposed for parliament 
seats on a national list were rejected by more than half the 
voters 
government funding ended when mazowieckis government took over 
in august forcing the party to lay off many employees and seek new 
ways of raising money those included renting out office space and 
operating garages and driving schools 
fully democratic local elections scheduled for april probably 
will end party power in town and city halls its last bastions 
grass roots pressure has grown for confiscation of the partys 
extensive property which many poles believe was acquired illegally 
during four decades of absolute power 
bureaucrats who enjoyed comfortable positions in state 
enterprises or institutions based on party affiliation fear the 
prospect of dismissal and see the property as their hedge against 
poverty

the platform with bush when the president spoke to the us 
conference of mayors meeting

passed along praise for boston police commissioner francis 
mickey roache 
he came up to me and said you tell mickey roache our 
police commissioner hes doing a wonderful job in that stuart 
case and were with him all the way flynn said 
bostons police force and flynn have come under criticism for 
the initial reaction to the shooting death of a pregnant white 
woman carol stuart after leaving a childbirth class last october 
charles stuart her husband suffered a gunshot wound in the 
stomach and said they were attacked by a black mugger authorities 
now say stuart probably shot his wife and himself he killed

warm fellow although they disagreed on how to solve urban

nice thing to hear thats the kind of person the president is we 
respect him for it but on the issues substantively theres a 
long way to go

president bushs new budget proposals will 
include more money for fish wildlife and recreation plus a cutback 
in timber sales forest service chief f dale robertson told the 
associated press on friday 
when the president unveils his budget to the congress on 
monday youre going to see a bigger shift in our programs than 
ever before in one year robertson said in an interview and 
youre going to see increases in these programs that the forest 
supervisors are concerned about 
forest supervisors and others in the agriculture department 
agency have questioned the conduct of their basic mission 
particularly as it relates to wildlife ecology and the publics 
use of 156 national forests in 43 states a total area equal to 
california oregon and washington combined 
robertson did not provide details of the plan but he added that 
you will see a lower timber target and expanded programs in fish 
wildlife and recreation and soil and water in fiscal 1991 which 
will begin oct 1 
were moving and were changing the balance of our program 
he said but you know how washington works you just cant do 
that overnight 
robertson commented just after a weeklong quarterly meeting 
with regional foresters and research station directors where he 
outlined some of the presidents proposals which need 
congressional approval for the coming year 
complaints have smoldered for months about what forest 
supervisors perceive as a decline in the agencys multipleuse 
function notably a concentration on timber production and sales at 
the expense of other programs 
a november letter to robertson supervisors in the forest 
services region 1 said there was growing concern that we have 
become an organization out of control region 1 includes montana 
northern idaho north dakota and western south dakota 
robertson said he did not consider the complaints as indicative 
of rebellion in the ranks of the agency and that debate has always 
been encouraged 
i see that as a strength he said it may come across to 
the press or outside people as a big rebellion but i see it as 
strength when were able to talk about some of these things 
one of the complaints has been that the forest service timber 
program has taken 35 percent of the agencys total budget for the 
last 20 years compared with 2 percent to 3 percent each for 
recreation fish and wildlife and soil and water programs 
that is true robertson said it has been heavily oriented 
toward timber 
but for some time he added the public has had a voice in 
forest service operations and has urged more attention to 
recreation and ecological programs 
we now have forest plans out there that say were going to do 
that robertson said the forest supervisors are experiencing 
some frustration theyve worked with the public in a forest plan 
and weve said were going to do that 
but the federal budget for such changes tends to lag behind the 
plans the task now he said is to rearrange our budget more in 
line with what the forest plans say we ought to do 
robertson said the changes and rearrangements come slowly 
however under the tight federal spending constraints now in place 
you just dont turn that thing around overnight he said 
sen patrick leahy dvt chairman of the senate agriculture 
committee told the foresters tuesday that the agency has not 
done enough to protect the environment and that too often it 
has given achieving timber harvest levels a higher priority than 
preserving the rest of the forest ecosystem 
robertson said leahys recommendation that the forest service 
work with a broader segment of congress instead of pursuing 
parochial interests was well taken 
many issues such as the endangered spotted owl and oldgrowth 
timber are being nationalized by being of interest to a wide 
section of america including congress he said 
asked to predict what may happen to forest service timber sales 
by the year 2000 robertson said sales have kind of stabilized 
since rising in the 1960s and early 1970s now he said they are 
edging down and probably will continue to do so

soccer field the pope said the former portuguese colony had been 
greatly tried by suffering as a result of its harsh climate 
scare natural resources and problems of hunger and malnutrition 
in this situation the lack of real prospects for the future 
lead many of your brothers and sisters to a forced emigration 
toward other nations and continents with all the problems 
involved he said on the second day of his eightday fivenation 
african tour 
as a light rain fell in cape verdes cultural and economic 
capital on sao vicente island the pope said he understood the 
problems of trying to adjust to a new society without losing ones 
cultural identity 
who knows how many of those of you here havent already had 
the difficult experience of having to leave your own land he 
said speaking in portuguese 
john paul urged all institutions dealing with emigration to 
safeguard personal dignity of emigrants and favor their free 
and responsible participation in community and social life 
while expressing understanding and solidarity with cape verdians 
living abroad the pope urged them not to forget the country and 
the families they left behind 
in finding bread and better living conditions in far away 
lands never forget your native soil and the people who live 
there he said

population of 360000 live and work abroad mainly in the united 
states portugal france the netherlands and italy 
there are an estimated 350000 to 400000 cape verdians in the 
united states mostly in massachusetts and rhode island the biggest 
community is found in new bedford mass

mindelo service said his sister moved to massachusetts eight years 
ago and his two brothes were planning to join her soon

better salaries there is no comparison to life here 
cape verdes economy depends heavily on remittances from its 
emigrants accounting for about 15 percent of the gross national 
product 
the united states provides 6 million a year to cape verde 
making it the secondhighest recipient per capita of us foreign 
aid in africa after egypt diplomats said 
the money finances projects to stop soil erosion promote 
reforestation and encourage more foreign private investment 
the steady drizzle that lasted most of the day delighted cape 
verdians who last year measured their total rainfall in minutes 
located in the subsaharan sahel region 300 miles west of senegal 
the barren windswept islands are often prone to drought 
after the mindelo service the pope flew back to the capital 
cidade da praia to celebrate mass on the quebra canela beach as 
tens of thousands of faithful kneeled on the black volcanic sand 
and small fishing boats bobbed in the choppy bay he recalled the 
countrys past as a slavetrading center and condemned every kind 
of discrimination

emission control and fuel efficiency standards 
in a senate clean air bill would drive some dealers out of business 
and give consumers a drastically narrower selection of cars 
automakers said friday 
in an unusual move representatives of fiercely competitive 
domestic and foreign manufacturers held a joint news conference to 
criticize portions of the senate bill that would set tougher 
antipollution requirements than president bush recommended the 
senate standards also exceed what a pending house bill would 
require 
the disputed provisions would have a devastating impact on the 
auto industry its dealers suppliers and employees and perhaps 
most importantly on the customers we serve said helen o 
petrauskas a ford motor co vice president and chairman of the 
engineering policy committee of the motor vehicle manufacturers 
association 
represented at the news conference were the big three domestic 
automakers plus honda volkswagen and the automobile importers of 
america which includes european and asian manufacturers a 
spokesman for the national automobile dealers association also 
participated 
automakers have two primary objections to the senate bill on 
which floor debate began this week 
the bush house and senate bills envision a roughly 3wed to us banks 
brazil cannot be relegated to the confinement and the 
backwardness in which it is living today fernando collor de 
mello told a news conference in washington 
he said the brazilian people can not pay a high price for 
solving the debt problem 
we have to pursue economic growth as the sole way for 
brazilians to solve their internal problems ending the social 
injustice amd misery of millions of brazilians who are hungry that 
live in poverty totally without hope he said we cannnot 
relinquish our economic growth 
he said he would use the strategy proposed for debt reduction by 
treasury secretary nicholas f brady or any other method of 
negotiation bradys ideas have brought agreement between mexico 
the third worlds second biggest debtor and its creditor banks 
though the amount of reduction for mexico is expected to be small 
there will be a significant drop in the billions mexico has been 
paying out every year as interest 
collor de mello said he had discussed the debt situation with 
president bush and secretary of state james a baker iii along 
with environment and trade problems he invited the heads of the 
world bank the international monetary fund and the interamerican 
development bank to dinner friday night before continuing a 
roundtheworld trip 
brazil the biggest and most populous country in latin america 
has been struggling because of the debt problem inflation exceeds 
1700 percent a year meaning that a given basket of goods will 
cost 17 times as much next january 
illiteracy is following the same pattern up to 27 percent in 
1988 from 25 percent in 1986 
collor de mello a conservative last month won brazils first 
presidential election in 29 years defeating leftist luis inacio 
lula da silva by a narrow margin

out strongly against it officials said friday 
engineer herbert schoettl had submitted to municipal authorities 
a proposal to instal laser projectors on two glaciers that he 
said would turn the famous mountain into a grandiose light 
sculpture 
the project according to schoettl would be an essential 
contribution to the festivities planned next year to mark the 700th 
anniversary of the swiss confederation 
but it stirred little enthusiasm among zermatters who argued 
that sun moon and stars suffice as sources of light for the 
14700foot horu or horn as the peak is called locally 
ninetynine percent of those present at a meeting wednesday opposed 
the idea according to one resident 
mayor daniel lauber was described as confident the final word 
from the communal council also would turn down the project 
this would mean us inviting sensation tourism a newspaper 
quoted him as saying we have no need for that

more than 500 united mine workers members 
from three states marched two miles up an appalachian hollow friday 
to demand the removal of nonunion workers from a coal preparation 
plant 
union coal miners chanting umw all the way marched up rum 
creek to a private bridge leading to the rum creek coal sales inc 
plant site of confrontations and arrests earlier this week 
were here to show solidarity in a peaceful manner and show 
the community of dehue that it needs a rabies vaccination to rid of 
some bad dogs said roger nelson a umw strike organizer 
miners struck rum creek in midaugust after the company 
reopened the coal preparation plant with nonunion contractors 
umw members men had run it before 
it was the largest gathering of umw miners since june when a 
rally in charleston in support of miners on strike against the 
pittston coal group attracted more than 1000 people the union 
said that march triggered wildcat strikes the next day which 
eventually idled 43000 miners in 10 states 
our focus is to bring public attention and bring justice to 
people in the coal fields said bob phalen president of umw 
district 17 
cars and pickups lined a state highway about 70 miles south of 
charleston and state police escorted the miners from west 
virginia virginia and kentucky two miles from a parking lot to 
the coal company bridge 
no violence was reported rum creek officials told us marshals 
at the site that no coal trucks would make runs friday marshals 
were present because the umw is under court order not to block 
access to the coal company property 
the continued presence of federal marshals and state police 
has helped contain umwa violence at rum creek said deborah 
herndon a spokesman for at massey coal co rum creeks parent 
company 
many miners said they were prepared to be arrested 
if thats what they want us to do well do it its one for 
all and all for one in the united mine workers said bill

declaration of independence

on strike for nearly a year about 100 of his coworkers also 
attended the rally 
i get emotional over stuff like this said bill ingram a 
40year veteran of the rum creek plant 
pickets have blocked the coal company road with cars and trucks 
on monday and tuesday coal trucks plowed the vehicles out of the 
way on wednesday federal marshals had them towed away 
two umw members were arraigned thursday in charleston on charges 
of assaulting federal marshals wednesday and freed on 25000 
secured bonds a third umw member was freed on 10000 unsecured 
bond after being charged with violating the court order 
on thursday about 60 pickets gathered at the site but allowed 
trucks to pass without incident 
the rum creek strike is not related to the 9monthold strike 
against the pittston coal group which was tentatively settled jan

justice william j brennan the leading 
liberal member of an increasingly conservative supreme court said 
friday that dissenting from court rulings is not an egoistic 
act but a duty 
in a speech to the new york state association of criminal 
defense lawyers brennan said where significant and deeply held 
disagreement exists members of the court have a responsibility to 
articulate it 
a copy of the speech was made available here 
i do not mean to suggest that one has a duty or right simply 
to make noise brennan said what i am saying is that all of us 
judges lawyers students teachers factory workers bankers 
must recognize values which are so important to us that we cannot 
remain silent if and when we feel those values threatened 
the justice added the right to dissent is one of the great 
and cherished freedoms that we enjoy by virtue of the excellent 
accident of our birth as americans 
for a dissenting judge brennan said writing is not an 
egoistic act it is duty saying listen to me see it my way 
change your mind is not selfindulgence it is hard work that we 
are not permitted to shirk he said 
he noted that dissents can strain collegiality and sometimes 
bruise feelings 
brennan 83 is the high courts senior member he was appointed 
by president eisenhower in 1956 and soon thereafter became a key 
architect of a liberal court under chief justice earl warren 
im sure it has not escaped your attention that these days i 
am often a dissenter brennan said how different that is from 
20 or 25 years ago in some terms during the 1960s i was in the 
majority in all but one or two cases 
he discussed the various roles of dissents 
to offer a corrective in the hope that the court will mend 
the error of its ways in a later case 
this function reflects the conviction that the best way to 
find the truth is to go looking for it in the marketplace of 
ideas brennan said it is as if the opinions of the court 
both for the majority and the dissent were the product of a 
judicial town meeting 
to emphasize the limits of the majority decision a sort of 
damagecontrol mechanism 
to express the conscience of the individual justice a category 
brennan called the most enduring dissents 
these are the dissents that seek to sow seeds for future 
harvest these are the dissents that soar with passion and ring 
with rhetoric these are the dissents that at their best straddle 
the worlds of literature and law he said 
the justice said the tradition of issuing dissenting opinions 
began early in the supreme courts history in 1805

a man serving life in prison for the attempted 
assassination of an iranian exile leader decided friday to call off 
his 19week hunger strike the justice ministry said 
anis naccache told officials at fresnes prison of his decision 
to end his fast without giving any explanation the ministry said 
naccache a native of beirut contends that france promised to 
free him in the deal that won the release in may 1988 of all french 
hostages then held by proiranian groups in lebanon 
on sept 8 he began refusing food to try to force the 
government to let him go he continued to drink liquids and 
doctors in the prison hospital fed him intravenously on occasion 
which they said could keep him alive indefinitely despite the 
hunger strike 
naccache 38 and four other men were sentenced to life in 
prison for a july 1980 attack on shahpour bakhtiar irans last 
prime minister before the 1979 islamic revolution bakhtiar escaped 
injury but a policeman and a bystander were killed 
both defense lawyers and the prosecution said naccache was the 
leader of a team ordered by top iranian leaders to kill bakhtiar 
irans current leaders while not confirming they ordered the 
assassination have supported naccaches claim that france promised 
to free him during the 1988 hos5 pounds 
there were fears that if he died french targets would again be 
hit by terrorist bombs 
naccache was one of three prisoners whose freedom was demanded 
by a group calling itself the committee for solidarity with arab 
and middle east political prisoners which claimed responsibility 
for bombings in 1985 and 1986 that killed 13 people and injured 
more than 250 in paris 
the criminal trial is scheduled to open monday for 10 people 
charged in those bombings

president bush told brazilian presidentelect 
fernando collor de mello on friday he wants to work with brazil on 
environmental problems and revitalizing its economy the white 
house said 
collar de mello refused to comment on bushs invasion of panama 
when asked during a photo session but at a press conference later 
he reiterated brazils opposiion to the dec 20 military action 
the only intervention we approve is the intervention of 
reason he told reporters 
environmentalists concerns about brazil center on the 
destruction of the rain forests there with increasing development 
encroaching on thousands of acres of the ecologically important 
forests 
the topic is a sensitive one however because brazilians say 
their ailing economy benefits from the development destruction of 
the trees is believed to worsen the global warming trend 
suggestions have been raised that debt relief for brazil be tied 
to resolution of the rainforest situation 
the president reviewed our own efforts to address 
environmental problems in the united states and expressed a desire 
to work with brazil and other countries so that a proper balance 
can be worked out between development and environmental concerns 
with full respect for every nations sovereignty and with the need 
to base deliberations on the best scientific data available the 
white house said 
at his news conference collor de mello said his government is 
aware of the environmental concerns but added that any actions 
brasilia decides to take will be because the government feels it is 
in the best interest of brazil not because of outside pressure 
brazils amazon jungle contains 30 percent of the worlds rain 
forests satellite photos have shown cattle ranchers and miners 
each year destroy an area the size of belgium 
collor de mello is on a getacquainted trip to the united

the problem as posed to 150000 school 
children on friday was this 
a student running 100 feet every 10 seconds 24 hours a day 
requires 1467 days to reach the moon he or she burns 864 calories 
an hour a slice of bread contains 60 calories how high would the 
loaf of bread have to be to supply the student with enough energy 
to reach the moon 
okay okay something is left out of the problem a sandwich 
slice is about onehalf inch thick the answer is 30419712 
calories are represented in 506995 slices of bread which stacked 
would be 253498 inches high creating a loaf of bread four miles 
high 
oh yes the moon averages about 240000 miles away though you 
didnt have to know that to solve the problem 
this problem was one of five presented on a satellite network 
connecting 900 schools around the country to spark youngsters 
interest in learning and to spur appreciation science math and 
teaching 
it was the first of such classroom lessons sponsored by the 
challenger center an educational project founded by the families 
of the seven astronauts who perished aboard the space shuttle 
challenger four years ago 
today we took you on an imaginary trip to the moon said 
dr r lynn bondurant jr chief of educational services at nasas 
lewis research center who conducted the program some day you may 
be on a real trip to the moon remember to reach for the stars 
teachers in the participating classes received matterials in 
advance the preparation showed as pupils afterward asked questions 
of michael collins who flew the mother ship while astronauts neil 
armstrong and buzz aldrin made the walk on the moon in 1969 
what impresses you most from that far away from home 
the size of the earth said collins first you have to 
find it it is as small as your thumbnail 
what supplies should you take 
hydrogen said collins human beings need water which is 
two parts hydrogen and one part oxygen you can get a lot of 
oxygen out of the rocks on the moon but you have to take hydrogen 
from earth 
how long will the footprints left on the moon last 
i dont know said collins eventually he said they would 
be obliterated by micrometeorites hitting the moon 
fridays lessons included calculations to find the distance to 
the moon evaluating the differences in gravity mapping the moon 
and the collins interview 
in the next few weeks the student will work on designing a lunar 
mining base and one plan from each school will be submitted to the 
challenger center 
for the gravity calculations the students were shown a clip in 
which astronaut david scott on apollo 15 dropped a hammer and 
feather simultaneously to the moon and they hit the surface at 
exactly the same time 
what they werent asked to calculate was one of the space ages 
most enduring mysteries how far did the golf ball that alan 
shepard hit on the moon during the apollo 14 mission travel in the 
onesixth gravity and no atmosphere to slow it down

a federal bankruptcy judge on friday delayed an 
internal revenue service auction of property belonging to comedian 
redd foxx just 24 hours before the sale was to begin 
us bankruptcy court judge clive jones issued a 30day stay 
despite protests by irs attorneys and the auctioneer involved 
foxxs attorney paul whitford told the court that the sale 
would conflict with the interests of the bankruptcy court whitford 
said the issue was whether provisions of the bankruptcy code 
override provisions of the irs code 
foxx who filed for chapter 11 protection from bankruptcy in 
1983 owes the irs 900000 in back taxes penalties and interest 
he was not at the hearing 
foxx gained his widest audience as a junk dealer on the 197277 
tv series sanford and son 
the irs seized more than 400 items of personal property nov 28 
the property ranged from his las vegas home to antique cars 
furniture dozens of pieces of flashy jewelry posters and 
photographs 
auctioneer robert deiro pleaded with the court to let the action 
proceed saying hundreds of people are descending on the city 
from as far away as asia to attend the sale 
jones said another hearing would be scheduled next month to 
review the issue of whether the court or the irs has jurisdiction 
over the property 
deiro said foxx would suffer if the auction is delayed because 
many of those who planned to attend saturdays sale would lose 
interest and not return later 
i feel mr foxx has shot himself in the foot deiro said 
deiro predicted the sale would go a long ways toward retiring 
the debt mr foxx owes the taxpayers of the united states 
deiro said a public showing of the sale items was already under 
way while the hearing was being conducted and estimated his 
company had spent 20000 promoting the sale 
jones also ordered foxx to turn over a watch which the irs 
believes the comic still has in his possession the watch was given 
to him by the late elvis presley and was represented as being worth 
the high six figures according to irs attorney rollin thorley 
jones said if foxx didnt turn over the watch by tuesday he 
would consider lifting the 30day stay

the public interest group citizen action on 
friday announced a nationwide campaign to push for passage of a 
comprehensive national health care program 
the current system is too expensive inefficient wasteful and 
does not provide routine access to medical care for everyone 
citizen action leaders said at a news conference 
we reallly cant wait any longer to push for a solution to our 
health care crisis said robert m brandon vice president and 
political director of citizen action 
the current system is bankrupting american families hurting 
american businesses and threatening the very health of our whole 
economy he said 
last year americans spent an estimated 600 billion on health 
care about 11 percent of the nations gross national product the 
group said 
yet an estimated 37 million people have no health insurance 
one of the consequences of this statistic the group said is that 
the nations infant mortality rate ranks 22nd in the world 
the group wants to see a system along the lines of the one in 
canada which is funded by taxpayers but still allows patients to 
choose their own doctors and hospitals 
brandon said the groups 2 million members in 27 states will 
organize a grassroots effort that among other things will work 
for statelevel passage of universal health care plans proposals 
are being discussed in nearly 20 state legislatures he said

police sought clues from overseas friday in the 
executionstyle slaying of an israeli businessman allegedly tied to 
mercenaries who trained colombian drug cartel gunmen 
arik afek 39 was shot to death and stuffed into the trunk of a 
car the dade county medical examiners office said the body was 
found in a miami international airport parking garage after a 
passerby reported a foul smell 
homicide is keeping mum about the whole thing said police 
spokesman george reyes apparently this is kind of baffling for 
them 
theyre still collecting information reyes said theyre 
getting calls from overseas from folks in israel 
afek was wanted by colombian authorities who accused him of 
helping an israeli who allegedly trained the guards of drug lords 
he was interviewed recently by us secret service agents said 
a us official in washington who spoke on condition of anonymity 
the agents preparing for president bushs visit to colombia for 
a drug summit next month have been inquiring into whether 
colombias medellin drug cartel has access to antiaircraft 
missiles or other weapons 
miami police investigators friday were interviewing afeks 
friends and relatives but hadnt taken anyone into custody said 
police spokeswoman lucy fitts she didnt have any information on 
who owned the beige buick regal that contained afeks body 
the medical examiners office released a statement saying afek 
died of multiple gunshot wounds but didnt reveal where he was 
shot or when 
police said afek had been dead several days when his body was 
discovered wednesday morning his wallet was missing and he wasnt 
wearing jewelry he was lying on his back wearing shorts and a 
casual shirt 
afek had been working in miami as an officer in a business that 
imports flowers from colombia 
in september colombian authorities issued warrants for afek and 
reserve israeli army lt col yair klein afek was accused of 
helping klein escape from colombia amid reports he was training 
gunmen for the medellin and cali drug cartels 
klein later said he thought he was training farmers to fight 
guerrillas 
at the time diva rojas a spokeswoman for colombias department 
of security identified afek as a civilian who had an arms business 
in israel and flower shops in the united states 
israeli television said thursday that afek was being 
investigated by the cia which had given him a us passport in 
return for information on israeli activity in colombia 
cia spokesman mark mansfield said friday he could neither 
confirm nor deny the report 
the miami herald quoting unidentified federal sources said 
us immigration and naturalization service investigators 
discovered afek made nearly daily calls to the israeli national 
police office at the israeli consulate in new york and well as 
frequent calls to a woman at the colombian embassy in washington 
he had been under investigation since december because he was 
admitted to the us under a special agricultural worker 
program open only to foreignborn farm hands and fruit pickers the 
newspaper said

children saying every youngster deserves the opportunity for a 
full and happy life 
the proposal which will be included in the 1991 budget he 
unveils monday is a step toward bushs campaign pledge to expand 
head start to reach all eligible fouryearolds 
bush said the new funds would permit head starts enrollment to 
grow to 667000 children or 70 percent of those eligible it now 
enrolls 39 percent 
i urge the congress to fund our head start proposal in full

emotional or material deserves the opportunity for a full and 
happy life bush said

necessary to succeed in school it serves preschool lowincome 
children usually in the year before the enter school 
the 1300 local head start programs also provide breakfast and 
lunch and screen children for medical or dental problems analysts

start the most successful of all the governments educational aid 
programs

billion 
i think a 500million increase is quite remarkable said 
louis sullivan secretary of health and human services 
rep augustus hawkins dcalif chairman of the house education 
and labor committee and the committee for education funding an 
advocacy group have called for head start appropriations of 5

a federal judge friday barred the state 
department from evicting lebanons deposed ambassasdor from the 
lebanese embassy 
us district court judge harold greene issued a temporary 
restraining order pending his final ruling expected within 10 
days greene was acting on a motion filed by lebanese christian 
gen michel aoun and his ambassador to washington abdallah 
bouhabib 
the state department argued that bouhabib should be removed from 
the embassy because the united states does not recognize aoun as 
lebanons legitimate ruler the united states has extended 
recognition to aouns rival president elias hrawi who was elected 
in november by lebanons parliament 
greene said the state department failed to consider that aoun 
provides protection for the us embassy in lebanon located in an 
area controlled by his forces us diplomats have left lebanon 
but lebanese employees continue to work there 
greene indicated that his final ruling might favor the state 
department but he criticized the united states for not giving 
bouhabib sufficient notice of the intention to evict him 
the state department received a request wednesday from the 
prosyrian hrawi government to evict bouhabib so that a new 
lebanese ambassador could occupy the embassy and adjacent residence 
the hrawi government representative appointed earlier this 
month is working out of temporary offices 
greene said that while he could not interfere with the us 
decision to recognize hrawi he rejected the state departments 
argument that bouhabib had committed an intrusion or forcible 
entry into the embassy bouhabib has been lebanons ambassador 
since 1983 the hrawi government removed bouhabib from his job in 
december 
assistant us attorney daniel standish argued that his removal 
from office served as bouhabibs notice of eviction from the 
embassy greene disputed that saying that those in possession 
of premises are entitled to reasonable notice and process under 
us law a 30day notice was appropriate he said 
bouhabib who has lived in washington for 20 years has refused 
to leave the embassy and the residence locking out most employees 
he controls the embassys bank accounts its files and diplomatic 
cyphers 
greene said the court has the duty to prevent the forcible 
turning over of archives to a rival regime at least until 
sensitive material can be removed

attorneys who were callous toward 
grieving families are the subject of a grand jury investigation 
into alleged illegal lawsuit promotion following the deaths of 21 
students in a school bus wreck 
seven lawyers and several runners soliciting business for 
them are the focus of the investigation said hidalgo county 
district attorney rene guerra 
some of these people were being solicited at the wakes which 
is pretty callous guerra said 
it is illegal in texas for lawyers or their representatives to 
solicit business from victims or their families the crime 
commonly known as ambulance chasing is called barratry 
the grand jury finished its first full day of inquiry thursday 
and will meet again wednesday guerra said it could take three 
weeks for the grand jury to decide about indictments he said 
in november guerra said he was investigating 18 attorneys in 
connection with the sept 21 1989 accident but he said thursday 
there was not enough evidence to present some of those cases to the 
grand jury 
the junior and senior high students died when a soft drink truck 
ran a stop sign and hit their bus knocking it into a waterfilled 
pit in the southern texas town of alton 
guerra was not specific about where the lawyers under 
investigation were from saying only that some came from outside 
the lower rio grande valley 
barratry in texas is a misdemeanor on the first offense 
punishable by up to a year in jail and a fine of up to 2000 and 
a thirddegree felony on the second offense under certain 
circumstances punishable by up to 10 years in prison and a 5000 
fine 
those convicted also could face sanctions from the state bar of 
texas including possible disbarment 
lawsuits that potentially could run into tens of millions of 
dollars have been filed in the case principally against 
mcallenbased valley cocacola bottling co inc owner of the 
truck the truck driver is set for trial in march on 21 counts of

the red army went into baku a week ago to stop the 
azerbaijani peoples front and other groups from seizing power 
defense minister dmitri t yazov said in remarks published friday 
he told soviet journalists in baku capital of the azerbaijan 
republic that on jan 20 the day after soldiers took over the 
city a meeting was planned at which it was proposed to declare 
the transfer of power into the hands of the peoples front 
baltic activists said friday that azerbaijani representatives 
had agreed to visit riga capital of latvia next week for possible 
talks with an armenian delegation on resolving ethnic strife that 
caused the military intervention 
opposition members of the soviet parliament and an official 
newspaper questioned the kremlins use of force in the caucasus to 
quell the ethnic violence that began jan 13 
yazov said the peoples front declared its own state of 
emergency in baku a full day before the soldiers moved in and in 
many regions of the city soviet and party organs had ceased to 
control the situation 
in the remarks published by the government newspaper izvestia 
yazov appeared to stress the need to control the political 
situation over stopping ethnic warfare in which dozens of people 
were killed 
president mikhail s gorbachev and other top officials have 
cited public safety as the reason for the military assault and 
ensuing battle with nationalists in which at least 80 people died 
the defense minister said the militarys task now was to destroy 
the power structure the peoples front and other informal political 
organizations had established in staterun institutions 
critics of the military move against wellarmed azerbaijani 
nationalists have said attacks on the armenian minority had ended 
well before the army moved azerbaijani nationalists have accused 
moscow of seeking to crush their movement against the communist 
party and government apparatus 
yazov said 80 extremists from the peoples front and other 
informal organizations had been arrested 
baku journalist tuuzala kasumova said by telephone that after 
meeting with azerbaijani deputies yazov had pulled some tanks and 
other military equipment off the streets of baku and the city was 
less tense 
yazov said the armys actions are directed at breathing new 
life into bakus fading economy confiscating weapons from the 
population and destroying the organizational structure of the 
peoples front leaders who are keen on seizing power 
according to our estimates about 40000 militants armed with 
submachine guns rifles of various systems machine guns and 
shotguns are loose in azerbaijan 
yuri n afanasyev a member of the congress of peoples deputies 
was one of the opposition figures who requested an emergency 
parliament session to settle the caucasus dispute 
from our point of view we should have a supreme soviet 
session to hear all groups to regulate the conflict he said at 
a moscow news conference 
we need to call a session so that the threat of the south does 
not touch all of society he said 
the presidium of the supreme soviet has the power to call the 
supreme soviet into session a regular session of the supreme 
soviet is scheduled for midfebruary 
although gorbachevs reforms have opened up soviet society 
afanasyev likened the decision to send soldiers into baku to the 
secret decisions to crush democracy movements in hungary and 
czechoslovakia and send troops to afghanistan 
he and 12 other legislators signed a document urging a special 
session of the supreme soviet to discuss redrawing the border 
between armenia and azerbaijan which have been locked in a 
territorial dispute for two years and a deadline for withdrawning 
the soldiers in baku they said they were categorically against 
the use of force 
afanasyev is a leader of the interregional deputies group the 
formal parliamentary opposition that claims about 400 members and 
was created largely through the inspiration of andrei sakharov the 
late human rights activist 
the newspaper komsomolskaya pravda said two veterans of the 
afghanistan war cols a savelyev and a rusakov sent a telegram 
to gorbachev jan 19 that said bringing in troops would lead to a 
total break in relations and put their families in danger as 
well as creating a rise in the antirussian mood 
since then thousands of relatives of soviet soldiers have been 
evacuated from baku and there have been reports of threats and 
attacks against russians in the azerbaijani capital 
bringing russian families into the conflict could spread unrest 
far across the soviet union despite having their own republics 
armenians and azerbaijanis live together with russians in many 
parts of the country 
military commandant lt gen vladimir dubinyak said baku was 
relatively calm early friday tass reported in the previous 
24 hours 147 people had been detained in baku either for breaking 
curfew or other violations tass said 
two newspapers were banned by the military authorities 
the agency said troops had not used weapons thursday but 
komsomolskaya pravda reported two people were killed when an 
armored personnel carrier ran over a car 
in moscow azerbaijani activists said commandos in bulletproof 
vests and helmets raided the republics mission and arrested a 
nationalist leader a moscow police official confirmed the raid and 
said it was being investigated 
azerbaijan journalist shain hadjiev said commandos charged into 
the government mission at 3 am searched it and herded about 40 
men into buses 
but he said all were released except ekhtibar mamedov who has 
gained attention recently by pushing azerbaijani claims that there 
were far more people killed in the troop assault on baku than the 
official death toll

a grandson and namesake of secretary of state 
john foster dulles said friday he is dismayed by a proposal to 
rename washington dulles international airport for dwight d 
eisenhower 
backers of the name change however said they still think it is 
a good idea especially since dulles often can sound like 
dallas leading to confusion for international travelers 
under a plan favored by senate republican leader bob dole of 
kansas the airport would be named for eisenhower but its central 
building designed by famed finnish architect eero saarinen would 
bear dulles name 
dole is chairman of the eisenhower centennial commission named 
to plan ceremonies to mark the 100th anniversary of eisenhowers 
birth oct 14 supporters would like to see the name change take 
effect by that date 
dulles 46 an analyst for the us civil rights commission in 
los angeles said eisenhower was most determined in his belief 
that the new airport should be named for his close friend and 
secretary of state 
it is most appropriate that we honor president eisenhower on 
this the centennial of his birth dulles said however it 
would certainly not be in keeping with his desires that the tribute 
which he accorded my grandfather be taken away in this manner 
in a letter to the associated press he said i was dismayed 
to learn that senator robert dole has proposed changing the name of 
dulles international airport president eisenhower decreed that the 
airport should be named for secretary dulles who flew more than 
half a million miles and who was recognized before the jet era as 
the most traveled secretary of state in our history 
michael d barnes a member of the metropolitan washington 
airports authority who is lobbying for the change said my 
feeling is that we can honor both of these gentlemen in the manner 
that has been proposed in the dole resolution 
the airport authority will decide whether to accept doles 
recommendation 
jane kratovil executive director of the eisenhower world 
affairs institute said we think it is an appropriate mechanism 
in the eisenhower centennial year to pay tribute to two individuals 
and to try to elevate if you will secretary dulles role as an 
outsider i would say that probably 90 per cent of the people that 
land at dulles today may not even understand that dulles was indeed 
john foster dulles a very important secretary of state 
the airport in the virginia suburbs was built during 
eisenhowers administration and opened in 1962 dulles a wall 
street lawyer long prominent in republican foreign affairs causes 
served as secretary of state from eisenhowers inauguration in 1953 
until shortly before his death in 1959 
the secretarys grandson said he also was writing to dole the 
senators office said the letter had not been received

a coalition of gay activists human rights and 
medical groups friday harshly criticized a conservative lobbying 
organization for promoting longterm psychotherapy as a way to 
cure homosexuality 
research findings suggest that efforts to repair homosexuals 
are nothing more than social prejudice garbed in psychological 
accouterments said bryant l welch executive director for 
professional practice of the american psychological association 
welch spoke at a news conference organized by the national gay 
and lesbian task force 
also participating in the news conference were the rev william 
sloancoffin president of the sanefreeze campaign for global 
security and representatives of the human rights campaign fund 
union of american hebrew congregations and federation of parents 
and friends of lesbians and gays inc 
the groups hoped to disrupt a weekend meeting of the national 
task force for the preservation of the heterosexual ethic 
people can be treated like they can be treated for 
alcoholism said the rev louis p sheldon who heads the 
conservative traditional values coalition that convened the meeting 
sheldon argued that reparative therapy has a 50year history in 
behavioral psychology but was removed from the apas list of 
recognized mental disorders in 1973 after presssure from gay rights 
activists 
the fact is i have not been able to cure one homosexual 
said joseph nicolosi a psychologistconsultant to the tvc 
but nicolosi said curative efforts must be seen as longterm 
sometimes lifetime processes 
sheldon a presbyterian minister and his coalition of 6500 
california churches gained prominence when they helped defeat a 
domesticpartnership law in san francisco 
last year the group tried to include creationism as part of the 
science curriculum in state schools 
sheldon said his group will publish a report on the meeting 
which is closed to the public next week 
a keynote speaker was rep william e dannemeyer rcalif an 
outspoken critic of homosexuality

hans modrow the communist premier of 
east germany said friday his country wants diplomatic relations 
with israel and is willing to consider reparations for victims of 
nazism 
east germany has never had full relations with israel because it 
refused to accept responsibility for adolf hitlers extermination 
of 6 million jews 
modrow told reporters after meeting with austrian leaders that 
east germany had proposed talks with israel and the problem of 
reparations will be aired 
interest in establishing relations with israel has grown in 
eastern europe since communist parties have lost or renounced their 
power monopolies 
west germany has paid reparations but communist east germany 
always claimed its people were the antinazi resistance and bore no 
responsibility for hitlers actions 
romania was the only east european nation not to follow the 
soviet union in breaking relations with israel after the 
arabisraeli war of 1967 in september hungary became the first to 
resume diplomatic ties 
when asked about his problems at home modrow refused to say he 
would quit the communist party as some opposition groups demand 
he said he would be ready to discuss his future relationship 
with the party when he had built a coalition government including 
the opposition that could run east germany until free elections 
scheduled for may 6 
modrow criticized the party for slowness in moving away from its 
stalinist past and for abuses under erich honecker who was 
communist party chief for 18 years until his downfall in october 
on friday modrows government faced a new crisis of confidence 
friday when one of the four small parties involved said it would 
pull its three ministers out of the 27member cabinet 
modrow told the news conference he was making a fair offer 
of a coalition to east germany opposition groups which are divided 
over whether to join any government he leads 
he is to visit moscow tuesday for talks with president mikhail

a senior member of the house armed services 
committee said friday that if the bush administration adopts a 
partisan approach to closing military bases a rancorous fight with 
congress is certain 
preliminary reports indicate that a large chunk of the bases 
slated for closing in defense secretary dick cheneys new list are 
in the districts of congressional democrats 
the pentagon is expected to release the list of bases monday 
the same day president bush presents his proposed defense budget to 
congress congressional sources and pentagon documents obtained 
friday said bush would ask for a 7 billion increase from this 
years 3016 billion to 3069 billion 
officials said lastminute changes in the closings list are 
possible 
congressional and pentagon sources said that among the bases 
targeted are fort ord calif in the district of democratic rep 
leon panetta philadelphia naval shipyard represented by democrat 
thomas foglietta and fort hood texas located in the district of 
rep marvin leath also a democrat 
other bases mentioned in texas are all in the districts of 
democrats while the installations cited in the san francisco bay 
area are represented by liberal democrats barbara boxer nancy 
pelosi and ronald dellums 
early reports indicated that the armys fort monroe a training 
center in hampton va was on the base closing list but a 
spokesman for sen john warner of virginia the ranking republican 
on the senate armed services committee said the senator had been 
assured the site will not be closed 
there are no significant base closures in virginia although 
there are several minor realignments said spokesman phil smith 
fort monroe is represented in the house by rep herbert bateman 
a republican 
rep patricia schroeder dcolo chairman of the house armed 
services subcomittee on military installations and facilities 
fired a warning shot at the pentagon on the issue of partisanship 
in base closings 
if the defense department is going to start playing politics 
with the defense budget then heavan help us that is an invitation 
for the congress to start playing with it and who knows where we 
can go schroeder told reporters 
among the red flags that schroeder said she will look for are 
base closings that largely target the air force and army but not 
the navy and disproportionately few closings in the south and 
overseas 
pentagon sources said the air force and army were expected to 
suffer the brunt of the closures far in excess of what the navy 
anticipated the navys not coughing up much said one official 
who requested anonymity 
despite the reports schroeder said she believed that cheney 
who served as a representative from wyoming for 10 years would not 
be silly enough to target democratic districts for base 
closings 
cheney knows this place better than any other secretary of 
defense she said 
the pentagon plans to brief lawmakers early monday on the bases 
it intends to close said one official but several members of 
congress have already confirmed rumors of closings in their 
districts and complained loudly 
i simply do not understand the logic behind trying to close 
down the most productive and efficient yard while keeping those 
yards losing money open rep glenn m anderson dcalif said 
of plans to shut down the long beach naval shipyard 
rep duncan hunter rcalif issued a statement announcing that 
the base list does not include any san diego installations but 
does include naval air facility el centro home of the navys blue 
angels which is in his district 
rep glen browder dala a member of the house armed services 
committee said that fort mcclellan located in his district at 
anniston is among the proposed base closings 
i am not complaining simply because theyre aiming at my 
district nor am i criticizing the armed services browder said 
they were ordered to cut and being good professional soldiers 
they followed orders and cut to the bottom line 
my complaint is that a numbers crunching machine is 
determining national policy without proper direction he said 
fort mcclellan has 2700 military and 1500 civilian personnel 
just one year ago congress agreed to follow a 
congressionallycreated commissions recommendation for 86 base 
closings and five realignments 
last years closings were part of an allornothing package that 
could not be changed this years base closings proposals will be 
dealt with on an individual basis as the defense budget is reviewed 
by the house and senate armed services committees 
i could have a hearing every hour on the hour schroeder 
said

rep augustus f hawkins veteran chairman of 
the house education and labor committee and the longestserving 
black in congress said friday that he will retire at the end of 
the year 
hawkins one of the last new deal democratic liberals still in 
office said he made the decision thursday night with his wife 
after concluding that maybe i can do a better job calling 
attention to my concerns on the outside than on the inside 
the 82yearold hawkins has represented the primarily black and 
hispanic watts area of los angeles and surrounding hispanic suburbs 
since 1963 when he became the first black elected to congress from 
a western state 
in 1984 he replaced the late rep carl d perkins dky as 
chairman of the education and labor committee his most likely 
successor as the panels chairman is rep william d ford dmich 
hawkins in an interview friday expressed frustration at the 
low priority the government has put on education under the reagan 
and bush administrations despite passage two years ago of an 83 
billion school improvement bill named in his honor 
if we only implemented that law as it should be education 
would be at the top of the agenda he said instead were 
moving in just the opposite direction fooling around with fads 
while an adamant liberal with a 100 percent favorable voting 
record from the aflcio six of the past eight years hawkins took a 
pragmatic approach in forging alliances with conservatives to 
advance his agenda 
in 1982 for example he worked with vice president dan quayle 
then a conservativee republican senator from indiana and sen 
orrin hatch rutah to assure unions and community activist groups 
a voice in allocating wage subsidies to businesses under the job 
training partnership act 
i never tried to play the role of superstar thats just not 
my nature hawkins said my approach has always been to get 
some tangible results you cant let your ego stand in the way 
last year he and hatch formed an alliance to emphasize early 
schoolbased childhood education for 3 and 4yearolds as part of 
a multibilliondollar childcare bill that remains stymied because 
of opposition from president bush and conservative democrats 
with child care high on the agenda of both the administration 
and democratic leaders again this year hawkins said he fears a 
compromise now may produce a bad result 
we may end up with two systems he said one in which the 
poor will go to inferior care facilities and the wealthy will be 
able to take care of their own children 
narrowing the disparity between rich and poor has always been 
the focal point of hawkins agenda 
just a year after entering congress he coauthored the 1964 
civil rights act title vii which created the equal employment 
opportunity commission and mandated fair employment practices 
in 1978 he was the coauthor with the late sen hubert humphrey 
of the humphreyhawkins full employment bill which officially 
targets an unemployment rate of 4 percent as the nations goal 
for most of the past decade hawkins was forced into a role of 
tilting at windmills as a leading opponent of the socalled reagan 
revolution an increase in the 335 an hour minimum wage was 
shelved for nearly a decade 
a raise to 425 over the next two years was enacted in november 
only after house speaker thomas s foley dwash bypassed hawkins 
to cut a compromise with bushs staff chief john sununu

a federal magistrate entered 
innocent pleas friday for four men accused of plotting to buy a 
stinger missile for the irish republican army 
the men who are being represented for free by a legal team 
experienced with ira cases refused to answer the charges before 
us magistrate ann vitunac the magistrate entered the innocent 
pleas and scheduled a feb 28 pretrial hearing in fort lauderdale 
michael dowd a new york attorney for defendant kevin mckinley 
said the men were advised to stand mute at the arraignment because 
defense lawyers may challenge the courts jurisdiction in the case 
he declined to elaborate on a possible basis for the challenge 
at this point im not ashamed to say i just dont know how we 
are going to proceed said dowd who represented one of five 
alleged ira arms suppliers acquitted in a 1982 federal trial in new 
york 
the fivecount indictment announced wednesday charges mckinley 
33 joseph martin mccolgan 39 sean mccann 34 and seamus anthony 
moley 30 of violating the neutrality act and the arms export 
control act and conspiring to destroy a british aircraft 
the men were arrested jan 12 following a twomonth operation by 
undercover federal agents posing as arms dealers according to a 
government affidavit 
a 47500 cash payment was made for the 5footlong 
surfacetoair heatseeking stinger missile which mccolgan put in 
a car at a west palm beach warehouse just before his arrest the 
affidavit said the other three men were arrested at a store in 
north palm beach about 65 miles north of miami 
the men were seeking the shoulderfired missile for the militant 
provisional ira for use against british military helicopters in 
northern ireland the affidavit alleged 
a us customs service agent testified in an earlier hearing 
that the defendants also expressed interest in 50caliber rifles 
detonators and plastic explosives 
if convicted the men each face 38 years in prison they were 
being held without bond at the metropolitan correctional center 
south of miami 
dowd and mccolgans lawyer frank durkan of new york say they 
have defended dozens of suspected ira members both participated in 
the socalled brooklyn five case in 1982 in which irish 
northern aid committee founder michael flannery and four others 
were acquitted of running submachine guns to the ira 
the defense in that case argued the defendants had shipped arms 
to northern ireland for 25 years with the tacit approval of the cia 
dowd said all four main defense attorneys have taken the case 
for free other defense attorneys are bruce zimet of fort 
lauderdale for moley and jo ann harris of new york for mccann

united states 17 months to dismantle the bases if no new accord was 
reached 
parliament is to debate a proposal next month to grant a

negotiators more time 
after 17 rounds with no result talks were suspended before the 
greek elections in june a shortlived conservativecommunist 
coalition put the issue on hold 
officials in washington said privately the decision to close 
hellenikon and nea makri was not related to negotiations on lease

he had been in hiding since us forces invaded panama on dec

refuge in the peruvian embassy but was turned down 
us army officials said romulo escobar bethancour a leader of 
the revolutionary democratic party that backed the previous

escobar bethancour was a major negotiator of the 1977 treaties 
that transfer the panama canal to panamanian control on dec 31

a federal judge friday lifted a ban on drug 
testing for 19 employees in the executive office of the president 
who have top secret security clearances but continued to bar 
the tests for 10 others authorized to see information only up to 
the level of secret 
in a lawsuit the employees are challenging random mandatory 
urinalysis called for by bush administration officials who declare 
that the employees hold sensitive positions and should be tested 
the employees are in the office of management and budget the 
office of administration and the office of the us trade 
representative 
us district court judge louis oberdorfer said it is 
unlikely that those with top secret clearances will prevail in 
the case although he allowed that portion of the lawsuit to 
proceed 
the judge said the permissibility of subjecting the 10 
others to drug tests is less clear and he kept the ban in place 
the government contends in effect that information classified 
as secret is by definition as truly sensitive as top secret 
information noted the judge 
on the record to date in the lawsuit the government is not 
likely to prevail on what is apparently the essence of its 
rationale that a government agency may in its discretion test 
the urine of any employee who possesses a secret security 
clearance said oberdorfer 
the judge issued the preliminary injunction may 19 covering a 
group of federal employees who do not hold white house passes 
a 1982 executive order draws the distinction between top secret 
and secret information by saying that disclosure of the former 
could reasonably be expected to cause exceptionally grave 
damage to the national security disclosure of secret information 
could reasonably be expected to cause serious damage says the 
executive order 
some 2 million federal workers have secret clearances including 
state department personnel with access to routine cables to 
custodial workers at nuclear weapons plants

a federal judge ordered manuel noriega held without 
bond friday after his attorneys repudiated the courts 
jurisdiction insisting the deposed dictator be declared a prisoner 
of war and transferred to a neutral country 
the prosecution gave several reasons why noriega should not be 
released on bail and suggested he may have placed a voodootype 
curse on four americans including the us district court judge 
himself william hoeveler and us attorney general dick 
thornburgh 
the government said the names were found at a noriega office 
where a black magic altar was discovered during the us invasion 
of panama 
prosecutors listed homes bank deposits sports cars and other 
assets worth up to 30 million including 58 million in cash 
found in noriegas panama ranch to bolster their argument that 
noriega would flee the country if necessary 
they also said noriega is an expert in counterterrorism and 
covert actions and still has a loyal band of armed followers 
mr noriega is an extraordinary danger to the community 
prosecutor myles malman told hoeveler noting that noriega faces 
145 years in prison 
hoeveler noting the defenses refusal to participate in the 
bond hearing said he had no choice but to order noriega 51 held 
without bond 
defense attorney frank rubino opened the hearing by telling the 
judge the defense would not participate because it challenges the 
jurisdiction of the us court system and his client is covered by 
the geneva convention noriega sat quietly nearby in military 
uniform listening with interpreters headphones the motion said 
noriega in a letter delivered friday morning to president bush and 
the secretary of state claimed the status of prisoner of war 
pursuant to the geneva convention 
there can be absolutely no question whatsoever that the 
invasion of panama by the united states military totally and 
completely fulfills the definition of armed conflict rubino 
said reading from the motion 
hoeveler did not consider the motion immediately and malman 
began his arguments against bond in the hearing stemming from the 
february 1988 drug indictment 
as part of his presentation malman implied that a curse may 
have been placed on hoeveler thornburgh and two other men whose 
names were found on a white sheet of paper confiscated by us 
troops at noriegas fort amador office referred to as the witch 
house because of black magic paraphernalia discovered there 
the other two named on the list were charles saphos head of the 
justice departments drug section and mark schnapp a former miami 
federal prosecutor who helped bring about the noriega indictment 
maybe i better not enter it into evidence the judge joked 
as malman handed him the list 
malman promised the government would show that noriega has a 
400000 condominum in paris and that 5800000 in cash was found 
in envelopes marked confidential in his threestory home in 
panama the prosecution also introduced photos of deposit slips 
showing that noriegas 17yearold daughter deposited 13 million 
in panamanian banks in september 1989 
the us govenment has frozen 20 million in noriega assets 
48 million in luxembourg 23 million in france 8 million in 
switzerland 16 million in austria and 35 million in other 
accounts that we do not wish to disclose at this time malman 
said 
the prosecution maintained that noriega also transferred about 
19 million from his account at bank of credit and commerce 
internationals london branch to its luxembourg branch a week after 
the indictment was unsealed it was not clear whether the deposits 
and seizures were duplicated in the prosecutions listings 
in addition to the vast sums noriega was said to have deposited 
overseas malman said noriega also had friends in countries at odds 
with the united states including cuba and libya he noted that 
moammar gadhafi had presented noriega with his and hers gadhafi 
watches which the libyan leader gives to personal acquaintances 
asked by hoeveler at the end of the session if he wished to 
rebut prosecution arguments rubino replied by reciting noriegas 
name rank and serial number 0001 
the defense motion had noted that noriega in his capacity as 
chief of state and commander in chief of the panamanian defense 
forces was recognized as the leader of the republic of panama by 
the united nations the organization of american states and 
independent governments in this hemisphere and throughout the 
world 
the defense contends that an international tribunal perhaps the 
world court at the hague or geneva must automatically be invoked 
by noriegas alleged pow status 
noriega has been held without bail since he was flown to the 
united states jan 4 and jailed in the federal courthouse basement 
here to face 12 drugtrafficking counts from the 1988 indictment 
the defense had refused to ask for bail because of the denial of 
us jurisdiction in his case prosecutors however feared that 
failure to guard noriegas rights could later undermine their case 
under a federal magistrates orders defense attorneys rubino 
and steven kollin have given prosecutors a list of two homes and 
three offices noriega used in panama in return the government was 
to supply an inventory of what was taken from the residences before 
fridays bond hearing began 
the hearing was the first time attorneys for noriega or his five 
codefendants in custody or out on bond have seen any of the 
governments case ten others named in the indictment are still at 
large 
richard sharpstein an attorney for codefendant brian alden 
davidow attended the hearing and talked briefly with noriega 
before the judge arrived 
he has a good sense of humor sharpstein said i asked him 
if he was going to watch the super bowl with george bush and he 
laughed and gave me the thumbs up

president vaclav havel of 
czechoslovakia suggested friday that eastern europen countries 
emerging from communist domination form an informal 
marketoriented union 
it is clear that our countries which only recently were

coordinating our moves 
havel said he planned to organize a meeting in april of 
government and opposition leaders from poland hungary and

yugoslavia also would be invited to the conference in bratislava

our return to europe but also the sort of europe we want to return 
to said the czechoslovak president a playwright who was his 
countrys leading dissident before communist rule crumbled last

for the first time veterans would be required 
to make down payments on va home loans to buy even the most 
modestly priced houses under a proposal in president bushs new 
budget sources say 
officials of veterans groups were quick to denounce the idea 
with one of them saying such a plan dashes the dreams of 
countless veterans of participating in the american dream of home 
ownership 
and rep sonny montgomery dmiss chairman of the house 
veterans affairs committee said simply on friday im not going 
to buy that though he added he was pleased with other aspects of 
the budget request 
i will strongly oppose all changes in the fundamental nature 
of this important veterans benefit said sen alan cranston 
dcalif chairman of the senate veteran affairs committee 
according to sources familiar with the proposal bushs 31 
billion budget request for veterans programs will include a request 
that military vets be required to make a 4 percent down payment for 
loans over 25000 
the va has already imposed a 5 percent down payment requirement 
for its mobile home loan program 
and an unofficial down payment system already is permitted to 
exist for relatively expensive houses for example a borrower who 
wants to buy an 80000 home but whose income would permit the 
purchase of only a 75000 home under the va program can pay a 
5000 down payment to make up the difference 
but such a broad downpayment requirement is unprecedented for 
the 45yearold va program instituted as american men returned home 
after world war ii 
under the bush proposal due to be released monday vainsured 
loans under 25000 would still be exempt from any down payment 
the exemption is designed to cover home improvements such as 
additions to a house 
in another area the budget for veterans will call for federal 
spending of 123 billion for health care 1 billion more than 
appropriated for the current fiscal year according to the sources 
who commented on condition they not be named 
that total would cover actual health care services provided by 
the veterans affairs department not entitlement payments such as 
disability compensation 
cranston said that if the medicalcare figure proves accurate 
veterans secretary ed derwinski has done a tremendous job in 
convincing the president that the downward spiral in va health care 
must be haulted 
federal housing administration loans also governmentinsured 
already require a 5 percent down payment while conventional home 
loans outside government programs can require down payments as high 
as 20 percent 
the gi home loan program was begun to ease the housing crunch 
for returning soldiers and to stimulate the construction industry 
after world war ii the lack of a down payment requirement has been 
a key advantage 
the program has undergone heavy losses in the past due to heavy 
foreclosures especially as a result of the oil depression in texas 
and oklahoma 
according to the va department 178000 guaranteed loans will be 
closed in this fiscal year with the average loan amounting to 
70000 
the administration also proposes to increase the mortgage 
indemnity fee from 125 percent to 175 percent that fee which 
began this month as a result of a law passed late last year is 
used to back up the home loans and to protect veterans from 
liability in case of foreclosure 
before that borrowers paid only a 1 percent origination fee 
if the 4 percent proposed down payment to the va home loan 
above 25000 is part of the budget it represents a drastic change 
in the very concept and intent of the 45yearold va home loan 
program said larry w rivers executive director of the veterans 
of foreign wars 
it is an unreasonable an unfair proposal which dashes the 
dreams of countless veterans of participating in the american dream 
of home ownership he said 
said spokesman john hanson of the american legion if thats 
going to be a plan then it seems like the va again is trying to 
make veterans bail out the home loan program a program whose 
problems veterans have not created 
and it seems very odd that raising the indemnity fee before 
its had time to work is going to be part of the solution 
veterans groups say veterans are being unfairly blamed for 
defaults they say losses are due to poor administration of the 
program especially in determining eligibility and to the va 
selling off its good loan portfolios in order to lower the deficit 
as for healthcare funding the proposed increase would still 
leave spending short of the amounts requested by veterans 
organizations 
although congress appropriated 115 billion for fiscal 1990 for 
health care but 160 million was cut from that under the 
grammrudman budget balancing law 
the total proposed increase would go largely for personnel 
costs included is 70 million in pay increases for va doctors 
nurses and other health care professionals in order to slow 
departures to higherpaying private jobs 
the veterans service groups say 134 billion is needed for 
health care funding for 1991 in a letter last december to the 
white house cranston urged bush to restore the 160 million and 
request a 2524 million supplemental appropriation for 1990

president bush will propose a 7 billion 
increase in military spending in the new budget including money 
for five b2 stealth bombers and two landbased nuclear missiles 
according to congressional sources and pentagon documents 
the budget to be released formally on monday includes a 
reduction of 38000 in military personnel the mothballing of two 
battleships and cancellation of several weapons programs including 
the marine corps v22 osprey tiltrotor aircraft and the armys 
m1 tank 
planned budget outlays for the year beginning oct 1 total 
3033 billion up 24 percent less than inflation from this 
years 2963 billion according to military spending documents 
made available to the associated press friday by congressional 
sources 
the figure includes 2921 billion for pentagon spending up 
from 2868 billion with the rest representing energy department 
spending for nuclear programs 
total budget authority for the military would be 3069 billion 
up from 3016 billion also including energy department money 
pentagon officials confirming the figures stressed that the 
spending would represent a 2 percent decline in defense purchasing 
power after inflation 
following the buildup of the early reagan years socalled 
real defense spending that is spending after inflation has 
been factored out has been declining slightly since 1986 even 
though the reagan and bush administrations have been calling for 
modest real increases the new budget will represent the first 
proposal by an administration since the 1970s for a real decrease 
the budget figures come on the heels of dramatic changes in 
eastern europe that have raised speculation that a diminishing 
soviet threat could lead to reduced military budgets in the united 
states 
defense secretary dick cheney in comments included in the 
documents said the budget represents the first steps in 
responding to changes in eastern europe and the soviet union as 
well as tighter budget constraints 
cheney said that while defense cuts were in order this is the 
worst possible time to contemplate changes in defense strategy 
defense department officials have been talking for weeks about 
military reductions that would save 180 billion over five years 
but those savings are measured against bush administration plans 
made last spring to boost pentagon spending to levels now seen as 
unrealistically high 
among the proposals in the budget is 55 billion in pentagon 
spending for five b2 stealth bombers congress last year approved 
funds for components for the five bombers in fiscal 1991 but that 
total is still expected to come under attack on capitol hill where 
lawmakers have expressed sticker shock over the cost of the 
radarevading bombers about 530 million apiece 
the budget also includes 28 billion for 12 multiplewarhead 
mx railgarrison missiles and 202 million for the singlewarhead 
midgetman missile the fiscal 1990 budget that emerged from 
congress included slightly more than 1 billion for the two 
landbased nuclear missiles 
money for the strategic defense initiative popularly known as 
star wars totals about 45 billion in pentagon spending which 
when added to about 300 million in department of energy and 
military construction money amounts to 48 billion a 1 billion 
increase over the amount congress approved last year 
the budget also includes plans to mothball two battleships the 
uss new jersey and the uss iowa and various cancellations of 
weapons programs some of which had been placed on the chopping 
block last year 
among the programs terminated are the marine corps v22 osprey 
tiltrotor aircraft the navys f14d jet fighter the phoenix and 
maverick missiles the apache helicopter the army helicopter 
improvement program ahip the f15e fighter and the m1 tank 
congress kept the v22 and the f14d alive last year over 
administration objections 
the budget calls for a reduction in active troop strength by 
38000 from the nearly 21 million and cuts in civilian forces of 
5000 and reserves by 3000 
at the pentagon a senior administration official focused on the 
idea that the spending would represent a decline in purchasing 
power after inflation is taken into account 
it means that we will be able to buy fewer planes tanks and 
ships and support fewer troops said the official who spoke 
only on condition he not be named

a mediator said friday that 
black workers and management have agreed tentatively to end a 
12weekold railway strike that killed more than 30 people and 
caused millions of dollars in property damage 
the farright conservative party denounced the settlement 
involving the stateowned south african transport services saying 
the government had capitulated to radical groups 
it is shocking that after one of the most violent strikes

charles nupen who began mediation efforts last week said 
management of transport services and officials of the south african 
railways and harbor workers union planned to sign the accord 
saturday

agreement

demanded by the 25000 strikers but the statement said nothing of 
a requested pay increase 
the company fired almost all the strikers but agreed to rehire 
them nupen said 
the walkout was illegal under legislation that bars industrial 
action against essential services the transport company employs 
about 170000 people and runs rail and harbor operations nationwide 
the workers struck nov 2 demanding that the minimum monthly 
wage be increased from 240 to 600 
numerous battles between strikers and nonstrikers followed

the failure of the meteorological office to forecast the 1987

president bush told congress friday that 
panama is now cooperating in international antidrug efforts as 
vice president dan quayle headed for meetings with latin leaders to 
soothe anger at the us invasion 
bush sent the certificnt of 
president guillermo endara has made the war against drugs a 
centerpiece of its program 
bush said panamas government and people recognize that it is 
in their direct national interest to end their association with the 
scourge of drugs citing the return of noriega to the united 
states to face drugtrafficking charges 
quayle left friday evening for honduras where he was to attend 
the presidential inauguration on saturday and meet with six 
attending heads of state later in the day the presidents of costa 
rica venezuela belize guatemala el salvador as well as honduras 
scheduled meetings with quayle 
in addition to their bilateral concerns a topic of discussion 
was expected to be the continued presence of us troops in panama 
which has particularly rankled the south americans the central 
american nations were generally less strident in their criticisms 
of the invasion 
i hope the reception is a good one quayle told reporters 
before leaving on the trip friday evening my message will be one 
of friendship consultation where do we go from here how do we 
build democracy in panama how do we build how do we build 
democracy in our western hemisphere 
asked if he expected to encounter opposition from the leaders he 
sees he replied ill find out when i get there 
quayle has stressed that he hopes to consult with the latin 
leaders on future cooperation and urge them to recognize the 
endara government rather than focusing on the past or 
fencemending efforts 
however bush has said he recognizes the hurt feelings that 
remain over the panama invasion widely viewed in the region as an 
invasion of panamas sovereignty in addition the latin countries 
did not look kindly on us troops surrounding the vatican embassy 
where noriega initially took refuge or the intrusion into the home 
of the nicaraguan ambassador 
bush said he wants quayle to explain that the invasion aimed at 
toppling noriega was not taken just to show wanton use of military 
might 
quayle travels sunday to panama where he will discuss details 
of bushs 1 billiion aid package much of which will need 
congressional approval for the spending 
on monday quayle will stop in jamaica where he is expected to 
face complaints about a 25 million cut in us economic assistance

the government confirmed for 
the first time friday that it had received a written peace proposal 
from jailed black leader nelson mandela but said its contents were 
secret 
the countrys most powerful rightwing politician andries 
treurnicht of the proapartheid conservative party demanded the 
government halt its consultations with mandela the prisoners goal 
was white surrender treurnicht said 
mandela south africas bestknown black leader is expected to 
be freed within weeks after more than 27 years in prison he is 
serving a life sentence for helping plan the start of an 
antigovernment sabotage campaign by the outlawed african national 
congress 
justice minister kobie coetsee said friday that he received from 
mandela on dec 12 a proposal titled a document to create a 
climate of understanding 
the document is confidential and enjoys the status of a useful 
background document said coetsee 
the same document reportedly has been forwarded to the ancs 
exiled leaders it is believed to suggest steps to bring about 
negotiations between the government and the anc which has the 
largest following among south africas black majority 
mandela has met regularly in recent months with government and 
antiapartheid leaders coetsee one of the officials involved in 
these meetings said last week the government might accept 
mandelas offer to serve as mediator in negotiations with the anc 
on thursday south newspaper an antiapartheid weekly in cape 
town published a policy document written by mandela urging such 
negotiations both mandela and coetsee said friday this was not the 
peace proposal submitted in december 
mandela said he wrote the policy document early last year 
handed it to a team of government officials and informed the anc 
of it he denied news reports that he had presented the document to 
thenpresident pw botha when they met in july or to president 
fw de klerk when they met in december 
de klerk who took office in august says he wants to ease 
restrictions on political activity to the extent that the anc will 
agree to talks 
mandela wrote that the negotiators crucial task will be to 
reconcile blacks demands for majority rule with whites desire for 
protection from black domination 
most africans black and white hope to see the anc and the 
government working closely together for a new era in our country in 
which racial discrimination and prejudice coercion and 
confrontation death and destruction will be forgotten he wrote 
the move i have taken to serve as mediator provides you with 
the opportunity to overcome the current deadlock he wrote i 
hope you will seize it without delay 
treurnicht whose party won 31 percent of the white vote in 
general elections last year said the government was making a 
myth of a man who had been found guilty of a crime similar to high 
treason 
what mandela and the anc demand is the transfer of power to 
the socalled majority treurnicht said it must be clearly 
understood that the white people will under no circumstances 
negotiate its own demise

president bush on friday announced another big 
increase in proposed spending this time for head start in a 
12 trillion 1991 budget he said was designed to provide 
opportunity for all 
at the same time however economists were saying the optimistic 
deficit projections underpinning bushs spending plan were 
threatened by signs of a weakening economy 
the anemic 05 percent growth in the gross national product 
reported friday for the final three months of 1989 could make 
meeting the new budgets deficitreduction goals all but 
impossible some analysts contended 
from proposed increases in spending for wildlife and recreation 
to tougher terms for homebuying military veterans details of 
bushs budget were sprouting all over official washington in 
advance of mondays official release of the spending plan for the 
year beginning oct 1 
bush himself was anything but tightlipped announcing some of 
the increases himself and telling the us conference of mayors 
that his budget would build on prosperity and together we can 
create opportunity for all 
one day after unveiling the antidrug portion of his budget 
calling for a spending increase of 11 billion he proposed what 
he hailed as the largest increase ever for head start a 500 
million gain for the preschool program for disadvantaged youths 
administration officials say the budget will repropose much of 
bushs unfinished agenda from 1989 according to administration 
and congressional officials the budget will include these 
highlights 
no new general tax hikes and a renewal of bushs call for a 
lower capital gains tax rate a tax credit for adoptions and for 
child care 
increased spending for environmental education and drug 
programs but a 85 billion slash in medicare funds and a 
requirement that veterans for the first time be required to make 
down payments of 4 percent on va home loans as small as 25000 
the most austere pentagon budget in more than a decade bush 
will propose 292 billion in new outlays up only slightly from 
current spending however the budget will include a request for 
increased spending on the strategic defense initiative to 48 
billion up from 38 billion this year 
a massive treeplanting program to help combat global warming 
and an appeal to developers not to clearcut new tracts but to 
leave as many original trees standing as possible bush also has 
promised support for elevating the environmental protection agency 
to cabinet status 
sharp cuts in a variety of energyconservation programs 
including 350 million from a program that helps poor people pay 
their heating bills and 161 million from one that helps them 
weatherize their homes 
an increase in federal spending for education by 500 million 
over this years level of 241 billion but coupled with cuts in 
the pell grant program that would knock 14000 college students off 
the rolls and cut stipends for another 13 million 
a new family savings account that would allow people to 
earn taxfree interest and dividends on money that is squirreled 
away for at least seven years with contributions of up to 5000 
per year per family 
the 1592page budget document was in its final press run on 
friday said donna alexander a spokeswoman for the government 
printing office some 24000 of the bluejacketed documents are 
being printed and they will go on sale monday at government 
bookshops for 38 apiece 
but even as the ink was drying on the final budgets to come off 
the presses a new government economic report raised fresh doubts 
about the administrations assertions that the bush budget would 
lower the federal deficit to 64 billion as required by the 
grammrudman budget balancing law 
the budget deficit was 152 billion last year and administration 
economists estimate it will decline to around 100 billion this 
year 
the commerce department reported friday that economic growth in 
the last three months of 1989 had fallen to 05 percent when 
adjusted for inflation considerably worse than had been projected 
by the office of management and budget as it put together the 
economic assumptions for the new budget 
the budget to be released on monday will project economic growth 
for this year of 26 percent even though the congressional budget 
office had issued a more pessimistic prediction of 18 percent 
slower growth has a direct impact on the budget deficit 
increasing it as revenues to the government fall the bush budget 
also assumes declining interest rates while interest rates in the 
past few weeks have been inching up also potentially adding to 
the deficit 
the recent economic figures will make total hash of the 
administrations claims that its spending outline which does not 
contain any new taxes can significantly reduce the budget 
deficit said michael evans president of a washingtonbased 
economic forecasting service 
were in the worst of all possible worlds interest rates are 
going up growth is going down evans said 
every 1 percent decline in growth as measured by the gross 
national product raises the budget deficit by 15 billion every 1 
percent rise in interest rates increases it by about 10 billion 
even before the gnp report the bipartisan congressional budget 
office predicted the deficit this year would be 138 billion far 
above the bush forecast 
chief white house economist michael boskin argued that the 
poorerthanexpected gnp showing would have only a modest impact on 
the bush budget he said the administration would not revise its 
forecasts at this time in expectation that the economy would 
rebound later this year still he predicted a period of slower 
growth

a couple has sued a maker and retailer of 
the diet supplement ltryptophan saying it gave the wife a rare 
and painful blood disorder that required hospitalization and left 
her unable to work 
federal officials suspect that contaminants in some batches of 
the overthecounter supplement caused the disorder in 1000 
americans last year and have blamed the ailment for at least one 
death ltryptophan an enzyme is sold as a natural sleeping aid 
the lawsuit filed thursday by louise and donald pangle alleges 
that she suffered rashes starting in september and later developed 
muscle aches nausea weakness and other pain 
mrs pangle 39 was hospitalized twice in november and has yet 
to return to her job said the pangles attorney joe leman 
the lawsuit catoosa county superior court names price ringgold 
drugs of ringgold and natures bounty inc and hudson corp both 
of bohemia ny as defendants he said 
it says the companies were negligent in the making testing and 
sale of the product and failed to warn the public about possible 
dangers of taking the supplement he said 
the attorney said papers had yet to be served on the defendants 
and no hearing date has been set 
telephone calls friday to natures bounty went unanswered 
outbreaks of the disorder eosinophilliamyalgia syndrome first 
appeared last year in new mexico afflicting more than 1000 
americans 
the atlantabased federal centers for disease control says the 
syndrome has caused at least one death and may be responsible for 
as many as six 
the disorder causes excessive levels of white blood cells 
researchers say people have used the substance for years without 
reported problems it was commonly sold in health food stores under 
a variety of brand names until the outbreak when most retailers 
honored a recall request from the federal food and drug 
administration and removed it from the shelves 
scientists at the cdc and the fda are trying to determine if the 
disorder is caused by the product itself or by contaminants that 
may have gotten into certain batches of it

aflcio president lane kirkland on friday put 
the power of his organization behind the free trade union movement 
in the soviet union and six visiting soviet miners said they 
wanted to follow the american lead 
the soviet miners have asked for our help we intend to honor 
that kirkland told a news conference that marked the end of a 
monthlong visit and aflcio training session for nine soviets who 
led the strike of 400000 miners last summer three of the miners 
were not at the news conference 
kirkland said his giant union which supported polands 
independent solidarity union in its darkest days would send the 
fledgling soviet movement medical supplies communications 
equipment and other materials that are essential to a trade union 
organization 
the soviet miners repeatedly thanked kirkland and the union 
saying they would keep the american example in mind as they 
struggled to build a federation of free unions from the scattered 
groups they are trying to organize across the soviet union 
in this work the afl is instructive said sergei a 
naidyonov a miner from the donetsk coal basin in the soviet 
ukraine the largest soviet coal producer and a center of the 
strike last summer 
the strike sparked a movement to create unions free of control 
by the communist party and government official soviet unions have 
been sharply criticized by the aflcio 
we no longer want to feed the bureaucrats naidyonov said 
we feel we have gained victory by starting independent unions 
the coal strike and ensuing miners demands for free trade 
unions caught soviet president mikhail gorbachev by surprise and he 
has sought unsuccessfully to persuade the legislature to ban 
strikes 
the soviet miners invited the aflcio to send a mission to the 
soviet union but kirkland said moscow authorities balked 
we regret moscows refusal to allow an aflcio delegation to 
meet with independent trade unionists in the soviet union and we 
shall continue to hope that this barrier is a temporary one 
kirkland said 
we expect the soviet governments restrictions will not make 
this endeavor an easy one and we foresee considerable difficulty 
ensuring that any material assistance we provide actually gets into 
the hands of those for whom it is intended but we will do our 
best 
aflcio aid to solidarity which continued even during the 
198183 martial law crackdown against the movement in many cases 
involved smuggling material across borders according to polish 
sources 
the us labor federation wants to repeat that success with the 
soviets and took them to new york chicago denver pittsburgh 
and the picket lines of miners striking the mcclure no 1 mine near 
abingdon va 
naidyonov said free trade unions were needed in the soviet union 
because it was clear that the official trade unions were not 
living up to expectations 
naidyonov is a member of the association of socialist trade 
unions or sotsprof which he said was attempting to coordinate 
among free labor groups organizing in the soviet union 
sotsprov is a horizontal structure he said it consists 
of local committees and seeks to coordinate efforts nationwide 
local groups include unions of miners white collar workers 
journalists and others he said

there was no warning of the crash said one passenger colombian 
businessman jorge lozano suddenly it was bumpy the ladies and 
kids were screaming 
i had time to say a prayer said lozano who suffered a 
cracked spine in the crash i put my attache case over my knees 
because i didnt have a pillow i bent over in the crash position 
in about five seconds we were crashing into the trees 
the crash occurred 15 miles northeast of the airport scores of 
emergency workers raced down narrow roads to the scene where they 
laid ladders up the steep wooded hillside and passed survivors down 
what a way to come to america one passenger told rescue 
worker jay krul 
the plane had been scheduled to land at 8 pm diane spitaliere 
an faa spokeswoman said the plane missed an approach at kennedy at 
924 pm she said she didnt know why the plane pulled away from 
the airport 
at 932 pm she said the plane reported that its no 2 engine 
was out at 934 pm the tower lost contact with the plane 
moments before the crash spitaliere said 
a veteran avianca pilot told the associated press in colombia 
that when the 707 gains altitude quickly after an aborted landing 
while low on fuel engines can shut down because the forces 
generated push fuel to the back of the tanks the pilot spoke on 
condition of anonymity 
the aps investigation source said investigators told him the 
pilot notified the kennedy tower that he was low on fuel before he 
tried to land the first time but he aborted the landing telling 
the tower he was having trouble with his no 2 engine and that the 
cloud ceiling was too low 200 feet 
other aviation sources who visited the scene and spoke on 
condition that they not be identified said the boeing 707 should 
have been able to make its landing even if just one engine retained 
fuel 
the planes voice and flight data recorders were recovered and 
sent to washington 
no homes were hit in the crash and there were no casualties on 
the ground though one part of the plane came to rest on a homes 
patio 
on board there was pandemonium there was a lot of screaming 
and groaning around me said lozano the colombian businessman 
there were bodies on top of bodies on top of bodies said 
jeff race 26 a new york city emergency medical services officer 
who lives a halfmile away and said he was the first rescuer at the 
scene some were alive some were dead limbs were bent every way 
you can imagine 
among the injured were an undetermined number of children who 
were bound for adoption in the united states cheryl simon 
cochairman of the latin american parents association which aids 
people who want to adopt said a new colombian law made it more 
difficult to bring children into the united states and there was a 
rush to beat the deadline 
a lot of the kids we got out alive said rescuer charles 
harris when you have a live kid in your hands you just pray to 
god that they will be ok the most terrible thing is when you have 
an injured mother crying my baby my baby 
the crash occurred a quarter mile from the home where the 
parents of tennis pro john mcenroe live their lawn was used as a 
morgue with at least 47 bodies wrapped in plastic and lined up in 
rows 
flight 52 had made one stopover in medellin home of an 
international cocaine cartel and some speculated that drugrelated 
terrorism was involved in the crash however matt murphy an agent 
at the federal drug enforcement administration office in new york 
said that was doubtful 
last nov 27 an avianca boeing 727 was bombed out of the sky

jorge lozano felt the flight turn bumpy 
the ladies and kids started screaming the 59yearold 
bogota businessman recalled friday hours after he was rescued from 
the wreckage of avianca flight 52 i thought we were going to 
crash 
i had time to say a prayer i put my attache case over my 
knees because i didnt have a pillow i bent over in the crash 
position in about five seconds we were crashing into the trees 
the boeing 707 plunged into a hillside thursday night on the 
north shore of long island killing 72 people and injuring 89 
lozano a grayhaired man who works for the american cargill grain 
company in bogota escaped with a cracked vertebra a gash on his 
head and a swollen tongue 
whispering in english from his bed at north shore university 
hospital lozano spoke about curious aspects of the disaster a 
low pass over kennedy airport a lack of communication from the 
cockpit and the possibility that the jet ran out of gas 
im so lucky he said my wife is flying in today to see 
me from bogota when the whole thing ended i saw a big hole i 
took my seat belt off i slid down the hole it was an opening in 
the plane right where i was it was a miracle 
lozano said flight 52 was already running late when it reached 
the fogshrouded metropolitan area 
we were told 20 minutes from landing that because of 
congestion or airport conditions we were going to have an 
additional 20 minutes before landing said lozano who sat in 
seat 4f in the first class section 
about 915 pm or 920 he said we tried to land we flew 
low i recognized the highways i thought we were going to land we 
flew by apparently the runway was not visible we went up 
circling very high then 10 minutes later it was bumpy 
and then the screaming started 
the pilot or stewardess didnt say a thing i think the guy 
ran out of gas lozano said inside the lights went off 
outside the lights were off but there was a little light inside 
the plane i guess it was run by battery 
then came the impact residents heard no jet engines roaring and 
there was no explosion authorities on the scene speculated the 
plane had no fuel left 
when the crashing stopped the hole in the fuselage appeared 
but lozano was stuck i couldnt move he said the plane had 
crashed onto a steep wooded slope a few feet from a home 
it took a long time maybe 30 minutes then the firemen 
came he said there were big lights they were trying to 
remove things 
there was a lot of screaming and groaning around me it took 
them half an hour it seemed like an eternity i was hoping people 
would help this little girl she was 18 years old she was 
screaming for her other please help my mother shes stuck under 
the seat 
looking up i saw people were being rescued on top of me they 
took me out and put me on the ground 
one of the men said this guy is much better than the 
others i said thats correct as long as you dont forget me 
you go and help the others i laid there counting my blessings 
it was a miracle

black activists ran through this 
mining city smashing car and shop windows to protest an english 
cricket team that began its first match friday despite a ban on

fiftyeight countries signed a un 
protocol on childrens rights at a ceremony friday as part of 
efforts to establish an international treaty to protect youth 
worldwide 
signing indicates a governments intent to consider ratifying 
the convention on the rights of the child adopted by the un 
general assembly in november twenty countries must ratify the 
convention to give it the force of an international treaty 
james p grant executive director of the un childrens fund 
said in creating this convention the international community 
has provided a firm foundation for a new ethic for children an 
ethic that defines children as individuals with inalienable rights 
of no less value than those of adults 
the convention stresses the importance of primary health care 
and education and recommends measures to guard against child 
labor sexual exploitation and drug abuse it sets up steps to 
protect children in cases of adoption foster care and juvenile 
justice proceedings 
a unicef report issued last month said spending by third world 
countries on armaments and debt service rather than health and 
nutrition could doom 100 million children to death by disease and 
starvation in the 1990s 
the report said that almost 8000 children die each day because 
they are not immunized nearly 7000 die daily from dehydration 
caused by diarrhea and about 6000 are killed each day by 
pneumonia 
the cost of immunizing all these children and providing 
medicines for dehydration and pneumonia would be about 25 billion 
a year it adds

the crew of a colombian jetliner warned 
controllers repeatedly they wer running out of fuel before the 
boeing 707 crashed on its second approach to kennedy airport 
killing 72 people investigators said friday 
avianca airlines flight 52 from bogota had been delayed by air 
traffic and appeared to have barely enough fuel to land before it 
slashed into a suburban hillside thursday night officials said 
the jet may have lost power in three of its four engines before it 
went down 
the planes crew however never declared an emergency or 
requested an emergency landing priority lee dickinson spokesman 
for the national transportation safety board said at a friday 
evening news conference 
eightynine people survived the crash and 72 died including the 
entire ninemember crew except for the chief steward dickinson 
said only nine victims had been positively identified he said 
the boeing 707 carried 152 passengers 
hospital officials said at least 25 of the injured were in 
serious or critical condition and more than two dozen children 
were among the injured 
some of the children were being adopted by american parents and 
were making their first trips to their new homes 
investigators picking through the wreckage of the jet in the 
woods of this isolated wealthy suburb found gauges indicating it 
had 10000 pounds of fuel left dickinson said that corresponds to 
about 6 percent of the planes capacity investigators had not 
checked the actual tanks he said 
after aborting their first attempt at landing the cockpit crew 
told the control tower repeatedly that they were running out of 
fuel or that they were low on fuel dickinson said 
in seattle boeing commercial airplanes spokesman jack gamble 
said the 10000 pounds would have been roughly the amount the jet 
needed to get to the airport but not much more 
gamble said 10000 pounds equals about 1500 gallons enough 
to land an airplane when its three to five minutes out from the 
field and the plane is in a normal landing configuration a 707 can 
carry up to 23855 gallons 
three to five minutes flight time equals about 17 miles in a 
landing configuration gamble said the avianca jetliner nearing 
the end of a 2400mile flight crashed about 15 miles northeast of 
the airport 
dickinson said investigators flew over the site early friday and 
determined the wreckage was on course for another kennedy approach 
in addition the landing gear was up and the flaps were somewhere 
between fully extended and retracted indicating that the 
airplane was in some phase of approach he said 
before the crash the plane was put in a holding pattern over 
norfolk va and new jersey for 75 minutes nbc news reported 
dickinson and an faa spokeswoman said they could not confirm that 
when it finally reached kennedy international airport the 
jetliner was forced to abort an initial landing in fog and rain 
because of warnings that it was sinking too fast descending 
too quickly and at the wrong angle dickinson said 
it was making a second approach shortly after 930 pm when the 
crew reported to the airport tower that it was having trouble with 
its number two engine the crew then reported two engines out and 
shortly thereafter the jet disappeared from the radar screens 
dickinson said 
prior to the first landing attempt the pilot laureano 
caviedes told passengers that because of heavy air traffic at jfk 
the plane would have to circle for 20 minutes according to 
statements by one witness 
but the plane spent more than an hour circling in high winds 
heavy rain and incredible air pockets said marisol velasco a 
colombian residing in new york city in an telephone interview with 
caracol a colombian radio network 
the plane rose and fell and nobody had told us anything when 
suddenly the lights went out the plane descended and we felt the 
biggest impact in the world he said 
earlier in the day a source close to the investigation who 
spoke on condition of anonymity told the associated press that 
authorities had compiled evidence indicating the plane may have run 
out of fuel there was no fire on impact and the landing was a 
lowimpact lowspeed crash suggesting that the plane glided to 
the ground also there was no fuel smell and the nose wings and 
body came down level instead of thrusting forward as they would 
have if the engines were running 
in addition witnesses said there was no explosion when the 
jetliner crumpled into several pieces in the woods 
dickinson also said there were indications that three engines 
were not working when the plane crashed the fourth engine buried 
in mud at the crash site has not yet been inspected 
the colombian radio network rcn reported that the 23yearold 
plane had been plagued by mechanical problems recently having been 
sent to the maintenance shop 37 times in the past four months the 
radio didnt say what the maintenance was for 
an avianca spokeswoman in colombia identified the cockpit crew 
pilot laureano caviedes 52 who had flown for the airline since 
1962 copilot mauricio klotz 27 with the company 3 years and 
flight engineer matias moyano rojas 44 a 24year avianca veteran 
one of those injured a 30yearold man was found by doctors to 
have four condoms packed with a white powder they speculated was 
cocaine in his intestines

two former air force base security 
policemen who pleaded guilty to stealing three fighter jet engines 
worth nearly 10 million were sentenced friday to federal prison 
terms 
the case grew from operation punchout a twoyear pentagon 
investigation of thefts from bases in the west and southwest that 
resulted in charges against nearly three dozen military personnel 
and civilians 
undercover agents running a phony military surplus business in 
the town of roy outside hill air force base bought millions of 
dollars worth of stolen military hardware over the twoyear period 
including the three engines for f16 fighter jets 
us district judge david sam sentenced airman 1st class brian 
david roth 23 to 10 years on each of five counts of theft of 
government property the terms are to be served concurrently 
in addition the judge ordered roth of chesterfield ohio to 
pay 2474950 in restitution and placed him on three years 
probation following completion of his prison sentence 
senior airman danny joe stroud 24 newton kan was sentenced 
to 37 months in prison ordered to pay 14711 in restitution and 
given three years probation stroud pleaded guilty to a single 
count of theft 
under a plea bargain last october government prosecutors agreed 
to drop 17 of the 22 original charges against roth 
roths lawyer jerold mcphee argued that while his client had 
committed a serious crime it is only a theft of government 
property albeit a lot of government property this is not a 
case of treason 
roth apologized for the crimes saying his involvement in the 
thefts began when he accidentally was issued two sets of basic 
equipment at hill and decided to sell his extra helmet as time 
went on his thievery escalated he said 
i am not sorry i got caught i only wish it had ended 
sooner roth said 
assistant us attorney bruce lubeck argued for a stiff sentence 
for roth noting that the theft of the f16 engines valued at 
99 million caused a monumental disruption of operations at 
the northern utah base he said roth was guilty of an aggravated 
abuse of trust 
strouds attorney stephen madsen said his client was a 
follower recruited into crime by roth he said he had been 
involved in thefts less than a month at the time of his arrest july 
10 1988 and cooperated extensively with government lawyers

the national transportation safety board said 
friday that a fan blade crack onethird of an inchlong introduced 
during a repair process was to blame for forcing a northwest 
airlines dc10 to make an emergency landing in denver in august 
the blade broke away and fragments punctured the left fan cowl 
in three places and partially penetrated the planes vertical 
stabilizer the ntsb said the crew shut down the engine the 
plane en route from los angeles to minneapolis landed safely 
metallurgical examination revealed that the blade separation 
had stemmed from a 034inchlong fatigue crack that began in a 
weld adjacent to a patch at the trailing edge of the fan blade 
the report said 
the examination indicated that the fatigue crack had 
originated from a small about 003inch deep discolored crack 
region introduced during the repair process 
the discoloration was so obvious the report said that the 
crack should have been detected during the repair process 
the blade had been patchrepaired by union carbide corp in 
kansas city the board said 
the safety board is concerned that other pratt amp whitney fan 
blades patchrepaired by union carbide may have similar or even 
smaller cracks that were introduced during patch repair and that 
these cracks could grow by fatigue in service producing blade 
separation and resulting in personal injury loss of life and 
substantial damage to the airplane and engine components the 
board said 
it recommended that the federal aviation administration require 
a onetime eddy current inspection of all such patchrepaired 
blades and if needed recurring inspections capable of detecting 
a propagating fatigue crack before it reaches a critical length 
robert berzok union carbides chief spokesman said the 
danbury connbased company had been working with federal 
authorities pratt amp whitney and its airline customers since august 
to inspect the more than 1000 fan blades repaired at the kansas 
city facility 
he said more than 90 percent of the blades had been inspected 
and the remainder fell in a very lowrisk category

the last leg of avianca flight 52 disintegrated 
into a series of delays ominous weather reports and increasing 
fuel worries followed by abrupt silence according to 
investigators and news reports 
cockpit voice recordings analyzed friday show the flight crew 
reported several times that the plane was running out of fuel 
before it crashed thursday night on long island 15 miles short of 
kennedy international airport 
also friday nbc news reported the flight was delayed three 
times as it flew up the east coast being placed in holding 
patterns once above norfolk va and twice over new jersey the 
delays totaled 75 minutes so long that when the pilot was asked 
if he could be diverted to logan airport in boston to avoid the bad 
weather he said he didnt have enough fuel to make it there nbc 
said 
at that point controllers ordered the plane directly to 
kennedy nbc said 
officials of the national transportation board which is 
investigating the crash refused to comment on the nbc report 
lee dickinson an ntsb member released information obtained 
from a preliminary analysis of the cockpit voice recording the 
recorder continually monitors conversations preserving the last 30 
minutes 
early in the tape there is some conversation among the crew 
about the fuel in the plane dickinson said 
a short while after the first reference to the fuel shortage 
the crew was told as the plane approached kennedy that there were 
reports of wind shear powerful downward bursts of wind at 
altitudes of 1600 feet to 500 feet 
on the final approach to the airport an alarm warned the crew 
the plane was losing altitude too quickly and was at an improper 
angle for a safe landing dickinson said 
the alarm repeatedly warned pull up pull up followed by 
another warning that the plane was sinking too fast he said 
the crew aborted its landing approach and asked the air traffic 
controller for permission to try again 
they said they would try again but they were running out of 
fuel or they were low on fuel dickinson said 
the tower gave directions for a second approach and the crew 
repeated that the plane was running low on fuel 
traffic controllers again gave them directions and asked them 
if that was ok and the crew responded ok dickinson said 
shortly after that exchange the crew reported two engines had 
shut down 
the tape ended abruptly after that but before the crash 
several ntsb officials said the recorder would have stopped 
recording if power in the airplane had been shut off several 
survivors have said all lights were shut off before the crash at 
934 pm

a prosecutor said thursday that a woman 
accused of killing her 6weekold infant in april has lied under 
oath by changing her story about a masked gunman who allegedly 
attacked and stole her baby 
paula marie sims 30 testified wednesday that the same gunman 
who stole her firstborn daughter loralei marie from her home in 
1986 also attacked her and abducted her 6weekold daughter 
heather lee last year 
assistant state attorney donald weber thursday accused mrs sims 
of changing her original account of the april abduction and slaying 
of the infant to neutralize what could be damaging testimony by a 
medical expert 
weber said mrs sims lied about the time the attack occurred 
because the expert a medical examiner said it would have been 
impossible for her to remember much about the incident if she had 
been knocked unconscious for 45 minutes as she told police 
shes changing her story as she goes weber said during 
rebuttal arguments she has specifically added facts to her 
testimony and the defense is trying to prevent me from proving her 
to be a liar 
in wednesdays testimony mrs sims said she was knocked 
unconscious for at least 15 minutes less than she said in her 
original account that meant her ability to recall events most 
likely would be clearer according to the medical examiners 
testimony 
mrs sims is charged with firstdegree murder of heather lee 
and has been charged in a separate indictment with obstructing 
justice and concealing the homicide of her other daughter no 
murder charges have been filed in that case

that besides citizens with private gun permits the new measure 
will also apply to regular police and even soldiers should they 
have firearms at home

four albanian defectors said 
thursday that anticommunist protests were held this month in their 
hometown of shkoder and police broke up one rally with clubs and 
tear gas tanjug news agency said 
the defectors said thousands of people tried to tear down a 
downtown statue of josef stalin during the protests on jan 11 and 
14 in shkoder albanias second largest city near the yugoslav 
border 
the destruction of the statue would symbolize the destruction 
of the current regime in albania one of the men told tanjug 
the four two workers and two high school students escaped to 
yugoslavia from their isolated country on wednesday over the 
heavily guarded border they were not identified by name 
they told tanjug that police did not make arrests or use force 
to disperse about 2000 demonstrators during the jan 11 protest 
but on jan 14 police fired tear gas and swung clubs to disperse 
up to 7000 people who had gathered around stalins statue 
about 60 demonstrators were detained and arrests continued for 
the next couple of days since the police filmed the jan 14 
protest they said 
the defectors said the albanian people expect radical changes 
to take place in their country this spring but did not elaborate

the regime poverty and hopelessness of life in albania 
according to tanjug 
yugoslav greek and other western media have published reports

the family of carol stuart on thursday announced a 
scholarship fund in her memory to aid residents in the innercity 
neighborhood who were put under an unfair cloud of suspicion when 
she was killed 
the dimaiti family said they want their daughter to be 
remembered as more than just the victim of a sensational murder 
they also said they hope to begin a healing process in mission 
hill where she was fatally shot oct 23 in a hoax that shocked the 
country 
the announcement was welcomed by some black leaders who have 
complained that police and the media were too willing to believe 
the claim of mrs stuarts husband charles that the couple was 
shot by a black mugger charles stuart committed suicide after he 
was implicated in the crime 
in a less conciliatory development black state legislators 
announced a bill thursday that would establish a special commission 
to investigate police work in the case 
the commission which would have limited subpoena power would 
examine how police built a case against william bennett a black 
man included in a lineup who has since been exonerated the panel 
also would try to determine where the media got information about 
bennett 
the commission wouldnt interfere with the criminal 
investigation but would examine why police focused on a black 
suspect and failed to investigate the husband earlier in the case 
said state rep byron rushing a boston democrat who sponsored the 
measure 
how did that idea last as the only valid proposition for about 
two and a half months rushing said 
immediately following the televised announcement of the 
scholarship fund more than 40 people telephoned the dimaiti 
familys lawyer and offered to donate money to the carol dimaiti 
stuart foundation 
giusto dimaiti 64 read a brief statement to reporters choking 
up during the end of his remarks it was his first public comment 
on his daughters death since the disclosure of the hoax jan 4 
she was truly the brightest of lights in our lives said 
dimaiti she will always and forever be with us mere words 
cannot express the emptiness we feel or how much we miss her 
his wife evelyn 62 and son carl 37 attended the news 
conference but did not speak dimaiti clutched his wifes hand and 
mrs dimaiti dabbed at her eyes as their lawyers took questions 
from reporters 
the fund was established for residents of mission hill where a 
massive manhunt was launched after stuart claimed a black mugger 
had shot him and his 30yearold pregnant wife 
the case drew wide attention and the badly wounded stuarts 
dramatic call for help on his car telephone was broadcast 
nationally his wife died hours later after their son lived just 17 
days after being delivered by caesarean section ten weeks after 
the shootings stuart apparently committed suicide after one of his 
brothers implicated him in the shootings 
in announcing the scholarship attorney marvin geller recalled 
the old scars of racial tension opened by the hoax 
the dimaiti family believes that carol would not have wanted 
her death to be remembered as the cause of such divisiveness he 
said carol would not have wanted to be remembered as a victim 
of a sensational murder 
black leaders in boston applauded the announcement but tempered 
their remarks with lingering concerns about the damage done mission 
hills residents 
i think its a magnanimous gesture on their part said 
louis elisa president of the boston chapter of the naacp maybe 
they can prevail on the mayor to make an apology so the real 
healing can start 
another attorney john wortmann jr said carols parents never 
suspected their soninlaw prior to his death he said their 
concerns were no more than the doubts that any parent would have 
about whether anybody is good enough for their daughter 
he said the family had no desire that anyone else be prosecuted 
in the case only that justice and the truth come out wortmann 
wouldnt elaborate 
one of stuarts brothers matthew has acknowledged getting rid 
of the gun but says he didnt know at the time that mrs stuart 
had been shot with it it was matthew who finally went to police 
jan 3 another stuart brother michael has said he learned of 
charles stuarts involvement in the crime within days but said 
nothing 
wortmann said there had been informal contact between the 
dimaiti and stuart families in recent weeks but declined to 
elaborate 
he also said the dimaiti family has made no arrangements to 
cooperate on book or movie projects he said the family knows books 
and movies will be made about the case and hope they will not 
denigrate the memory of carol stuart

former cbs news president richard s salant on 
thursday criticized the relatively new trend of sending network 
anchormen overseas to make their newscasts where big news is 
breaking 
abc nightline anchor ted koppel said he agreed with salants 
complaints but that such actions were necessary because the 
anchors are the ones who in very large measure are perceived as 
bringing in the audience 
the two appeared at a dupontcolumbia university forum on 
network news along with former nbc news president les crystal now 
executive producer of pbs macneillehrer newshour and nbc news 
vice president tim russert 
salant referring to network anchormens trips last year to 
eastern europe and west germany when the berlin wall was being 
demolished said hes against such trips known in network news 
circles as bigfooting a story 
network news divisions may consider it important but i dont 
like this business of it not being an important story unless you 
get the anchor there said salant who retired from cbs in 1978 
its better to use correspondents who know the territory and 
have long experience covering the story he said drawing chuckles 
by joking that the berlin wall doesnt go down unless the 
anchors are there 
salant who didnt single out any anchorman for criticism cited 
what he said was a large staff cbs sent to west berlin for dan 
rathers newscasts there it costs more to do that but i think 
its money ill spent he said 
koppel wrly noted that hes going to south africa this year to 
anchor his program from there and that he hoped it will be money 
well spent 
in an age of cable news and satellite when network newscasts 
are fighting far stronger competition than ever before its 
important to have someone to whom viewers are loyal koppel said 
in this new era koppel said having that familiar face 
peter jennings dan rather tom brokaw is the only thing that now 
distinguishes the networks in the eyes of many people many 
viewers 
it is the familiarity with an anchor that youve known for 
ten 15 20 years

fans of the famous teddy z may demand a 
recount cbs temporarily took it off the air to make room for 
valerie harpers new sitcom city which makes its premiere 
tonight the move does not seem wise 
city where harper plays liz gianni the harried city 
manager presiding over a colorful staff in one of televisions many 
towns with no names is somewhat to the left of whoopee 
its not just because the show has an offscreen announcer 
intone in every city there is a handful of unsung heroes that 
make the city run underappreciated overworked underpaid they 
are the bureaucrats 
nor is it because our single heroine has one of the old 
reliables of sitcoms a 19yearold daughter some shows costar 
kid sisters to vary things who has dropped out of college and come 
to live with her 
or even because the staff worries about lizs sex life its not 
clear if liz is widowed divorced or what have you one of her 
crew noting liz has a date with a councilman coming up cheerfully 
says hey miss gianni hope you score tonight 
its just that the whole show kind of falls down and goes boom 
this usually indicates that succeeding episodes may do likewise 
with luanne ponce as harpers mischievous daughter tonights 
debut foaled by executive producer paul hagguis offers harper two 
crises 
one is the daughters announcement she is thinking of having sex 
with a married man whose name she doesnt know the other is a 
bunch of coffins that have slid down a hill into the city it seems 
they accidentally were exhumed by a bulldozer rooting around in 
what is described as an abandoned cemetery 
the coffin caper touches off an emergency meeting at harpers 
rundown city hall office this of course lets viewers meet her 
mildly zany staff and the citys dim obnoxious easily bribed 
deputy mayor 
raising a point of disorder at the meeting a cubanborn 
bureaucrat liz torres says americans dont appreciate freedom and 
that her husband rots in a cuban jail just because he fought 
for freedom 
the assistant city manager todd sussman scoffs your husband 
was caught smuggling in 40 crates of teddy ruxpin dolls from 
florida 
when the cia asks for a favor you dont ask why says she 
with snappy patter like this all one can do is pray for the 
players and note that two of them provide the only good moments 
salvaging dead lines with fine timing and sly performances 
those two are james lorinz excellent in a small part as the 
young security chief of city hall and sussman 
the performance of harper who last starred on cbs in rhoda 
a spinoff of the mary tyler moore show is up to her usual 
standards but she doesnt seem at ease in city 
that is understandable given the quality of tonights script 
the whole thing is best summed up in a line by the daughter who 
says i sort of need to flounder around a while to try to find 
out what i want 
with cbs trying to avoid a third season in the nielsen cellar 
city had best find out what it wants and swiftly cbs cant 
afford to let it flounder you know what happens when any dead 
fish is left around too long

the plea came crackling over twoway 
radios in the predawn hours of feb 2 1980 you all stop killing 
each other theres blood all over no more killing no more 
hurting 
it was merely a hint of the horror going on inside new mexicos 
only maximum security prison after inmates seized control some 
prisoners were systematically and brutally murdering others 
officials later said they were settling personal grudges against 
informers 
when it was over 33 inmates were dead the worst prison riot 
in the united states since the 1971 attica rebellion in new york 
that left 43 dead 
the rebellion exposed an inadequate and mismanaged prison system 
run by an insufficient number of poorly trained underpaid and 
sometimes abusive guards in a facility overflowing with frustrated 
criminals 
in the decade since the state has spent 1275 million building 
prisons and training for guards has been improved since 1980 the 
prison system has been operated under a federal court decree 
covering 13 broad areas of prison life 
the uprising began at 2 am that saturday 10 years ago when 
inmates beat and overpowered three unarmed guards within seconds 
the convicts had smashed the newly installed and supposedly 
unbreakable tempered glass around the prison control room gaining 
control of internal locks and communications 
fifteen minutes later gov bruce kings security men notified 
him that the lights were off at the penitentiary and that there was 
no response from 15 corrections officers inside 
king ordered the state police to take up positions outside the 
prison where they were joined a few hours later by the national 
guard 
for 36 hours the inmates controlled the prison which was built 
to house 850 prisoners but held more than 1130 they burned most 
of the penitentiary buildings destroyed records terrorized their 
hostages and beat and raped other prisoners 
state medical examiner dr james weston whose office autopsied 
the dead later said most of the bodies had been mutilated and some 
had injuries suggesting torture one prisoner had been beheaded 
reporters and others listening to the twoway radio 
conversations between inmates early in the siege heard prisoners 
talking about the carnage under way 
one inmate radioed theres a whole lot of dead in a1 about 
15 that prompted another to plead for no more violence in a 
general broadcast to the prison 
clouds of thick black smoke billowed from several areas of the 
penitentiary as helpless officials outside identified the burning 
buildings the administration offices the gymnasium the 
psychiatric ward 
get a fire truck in here a riot leader called chopper one 
radioed just before dawn there are men suffocating to death 
theres fire a lot of places on fire in the chapel in the gym 
early in the rebellion the prisoners had released two injured 
guards but chopper one later told officials if you dont start 
negotiating pretty soon these remaining guards are going to get 
wasted 
corrections secretary felix rodriguez and deputy warden robert 
montoya went inside to talk with inmates but king said they had 
problems determining who was leading the rebellion 
they will start talking to one inmate and another will run up 
and say he is in charge the governor said 
at first he said there were no specific demands 
they said they were treated like kids and not like men king 
said 
the inmates did demand that there be no prosecution for any 
crimes committed during the riot but state officials refused 
later the prisoners drew up a list of 11 demands including 
better food recreation visiting conditions and educational 
opportunities an end to overcrowding and assurances there would be 
no retaliation for the uprising 
about 80 inmates who had announced they wanted no part of the 
rebellion moved to the prison ball field about 8 am saturday 
throughout the day more inmates surrendered 
by saturday night warden jerry griffin estimated about 450 had 
turned themselves in and although the prisoners were still in 
control griffin said the situation was stable 
the inmates continued releasing hostages one by one by early 
sunday morning nine still were held by midday sunday most of the 
fires had died down about half the prisoners had surrendered and 
two more guards were freed 
seven inmates had been confirmed dead and dozens were 
hospitalized some for drug overdoses after rioters broke into the 
penitentiarys pharmacy 
at 145 pm sunday about 100 guardsmen carrying m16s and 
police officers carrying shotguns marched in retaking control 
within minutes without firing a shot 
within hours the full horror began to be known 
lt richard montoya who headed the state police special weapons 
and tactics team that led the move to retake the prison said 
there was blood all over against the wall smeared around 
a blowtorch had been turned on one prisoner and a rod was rammed 
through anothers head a mutilation the medical examiner later 
determined occurred after death 
some of these guys faces are totally gone corrections 
officer fred herrera said theres nothing to identify 
national guardsmen are throwing up all over said 
corrections commission chairman steven richards 
the us supreme court earlier this month declined to consider 
new mexico attorney general hal strattons challenge to the consent 
decree governing new mexicos prisons which stratton contended the 
federal courts lack the jurisdiction to enforce 
the former inmate whose 1977 lawsuit led to the decree dwight 
duran blames efforts to overturn it on conservative 
saberrattling legislators 
he called the decree the inmates only way to prevent the prison 
system from backsliding 
ill still be around duran said and so will a lot of 
other people who believe as i do and who are knowledgeable enough 
to do battle with the saberrattlers

the realization that a recession is possible 
seems to come as a shock to a good part of the investment and 
economic fraternity almost as if they had been caught from behind 
by a mugger 
but the signals have been flashing all year long 
the rate of corporate earnings increases has been shrinking for 
a year but it wasnt until september that it seemed to grab 
attention the index of leading economic indicators has also been 
flashing yellow since last january 
industrial production has been showing weakness for several 
months and the level of corporate dividend cuts or omissions has 
been moving higher banks are in trouble inventories have been 
growing factories have cut work weeks 
nobody knows better than brokers that the sevenyear era of 
growth has encountered problems some have had their commissions 
cut their companies have run into financial problems their 
analysts have been issuing warnings 
it was there in the numbers too in the various ratios of stock 
prices to values such as the priceearnings and priceequity 
ratios which were running higher albeit not by much than their 
longterm averages 
but all the warnings might not have mattered however judging 
from the sense of shock being expressed around wall street among 
economists and in the laboratories of academe they may not have 
heeded their own advice 
that the economy was likely to slow was evident in still another 
obvious way the determination of alan greenspan chairman of the 
federal reserve to resist any substantial economic growth until he 
had conquered inflation 
while some people perhaps even including a few in the white 
house might think that any inflation rate below 5 percent is 
tolerable greenspan more than once has indicated that nothing 
above zero is acceptable 
the very attempt to achieve anything approaching zero inflation 
was in itself a warning because no person or institution can 
tinker with an inflation level that low without running the danger 
of recession 
the warnings therefore were there and seemingly ignored 
seven long years of expansion unprecedented in any peacetime 
period this century probably had dulled the sense of fear that had 
prevailed throughout the 1970s 
that dulling was evident in the annual forecasts issued during 
december when one forecast after another came out with the same 
view of 1990 a year of slow growth low inflation and underlined 
no recession 
now that recession fears have been roused it seems there exists 
a danger that those fears will cloud the outlook as badly as their 
earlier absence hid the true nature of things it wouldnt be the 
first time 
in fact while everyone is talking about a recession to come 
the factors of recovery might be taking shape the fed for 
example could be thinking about easing money restraints the 
japanese could be looking at us stocks 
the past demonstrates clearly that economic forecasters are at 
their best when little change is expected and at their worst in 
attempting to spot economic turnabouts it could happen again 
they are not alone in their failure to discover either the 
present or the future when gerald ford was president he had just 
begun a campaign to cool the economy and whip inflation when his 
economists spotted a cloud 
it was recession instead

eastern proposed that unsecured creditors be paid only 10 
percent of their debts in cash when the airline emerges from 
bankruptcy protection and another 70 percent over the following 10 
years without interest 
in return for accepting partial repayment easterns parent 
texas air corp would give the creditors 40 percent of the 
airlines equity reducing its holding to 60 percent 
under easterns two previous plans unsecured creditors were to 
be repaid in full with interest at the completion of chapter 11 
eastern owes the unsecured creditors primarily trade suppliers 
such as aircraft manufacturers around 11 billion 
easterns plan also calls for paying preferred stockholders to 
whom it owes another 1175 billion no more than 10 cents on the 
dollar in the form of new stock 
on the other hand consumers holding 45 million in eastern 
tickets made unusable by the strike that began last march 4 still 
would receive full cash payment if the reorganization plan is 
approved by the court they also would have the option of 
exchanging tickets for other eastern tickets of higher value 
attorneys for the unsecured creditors committee said they were 
reserving judgment on the new plan 
the committee will evaluate this plan as well as consider 
other options and will measure this plan against various 
alternatives said adam harris a lawyer for the group he 
declined to elaborate 
eastern also told the creditors it expects to post a net loss of 
280 million for the fourth quarter bringing losses for all of 
1989 to an estimated 850 million the airline also projected a 
125 million net loss for the first quarter of 1990

texas air had sold its stake in the nations largest airline 
holding company 
loomis sayles amp co an investment firm based in boston said 
wednesday it had sold its stake in texas air also the parent of 
houstonbased continental airlines last summer loomis sayles 
controlled 123 percent of the company 
i sold every share i owned said ken heebner loomis sayles 
portfolio manager if i had other airlines i would have sold 
them he said airline stocks are no longer attractive 
stock of houstonbased texas air continued to drop thursday 
falling 37 cents to close at 7 after plunging 137 on wednesday 
before the meeting rumors swirled that texas air itself could 
seek chapter 11 bankruptcy protection from creditors as did 
eastern last march and continental in 1983 
the fort worth texas star telegram published an article 
wednesday headlined texas air fighting rumors of its demise 
texas air spokesman art kent rejected the article on thursday 
continental is not going into bankruptcy texas air is not 
going into bankruptcy eastern is not going to be liquidated he 
said in a telephone interview from houston we are in very good 
financial condition 
kent said the three companies together have around 1 billion in

in a statement issued late thursday eastern said it plans to 
emerge from bankruptcy as soon as midyear as a strong 
competitor with 500 million in cash access to new aircraft and 
a more conservative balance sheet 
the new reorganization plan helps position eastern as a 
significant competitor and provides definite advantages to the 
consumer eastern president phil bakes said in the statement

its creditors must agree to the plan then obtain the approval of 
the bankruptcy court before the proposal can be implemented and 
eastern can emerge from bankruptcy

the securities and exchange commission has 
suspended trading for 10 days in the securities of bolar 
pharmaceutical co the generic drug maker accused of falsifying 
safety claims 
the sec said it suspended trading thursday because of the lack 
of adequate current information concerning the recent public 
disclosure that certain false documents were submitted to the food 
and drug administration 
on tuesday a house subcommittee disclosed a letter from bolars 
attorneys that indicated the copaigue nybased generic drug 
maker apparently falsified documents about safety tests for its 
version of a popular blood pressurecontrolling drug 
the sec said suspension of trading for bolar securities began at 
930 am thursday and would continue until 1159 pm feb 3 
the sec made their decision to suspend trading because the 
company did not disclose enough information and when we can we 
will a bolar spokeswoman patricia shukri said from the 
companys long island headquarters 
this whole matter is under investigation and the company 
cannot make further comment at this time she said 
bolars antihypertension drug is the only generic version of 
dyazide on the market after another company took its version off 
the market after it admitted cheating on tests required for fda 
approval 
dyazide is a widely prescribed high blood pressure medication 
made by smithkline beecham two generic versions of the drug were 
approved by the fda 
in august the fda said it would seek to remove bolars version 
of the drug claiming the drug maker may have misrepresented 
documentation and safety data an allegation bolar denied 
however the house energy and commerce committees subcommittee 
on oversight and investigations disclosed a letter from attorneys 
for bolar which said the company appeared to have used false 
documents to fight government action against its generic form of of 
dyazide 
leaders of the subcommittee said tuesday that it appears the 
company was involved in a criminal coverup and called for 
bolar to remove its generic drug dyazide from the market

a group dedicated to fighting telemarketing 
fraud is urging victims of con artists to speak out and report them 
to the authorities 
please dont suffer in silence said mike mccarey of the 
federal trade commissions consumer protection bureau 
dont be ashamed if you become a victim said linda f 
golodner executive director of the national consumers league 
report it to the authorities so something can be done to help the 
next person 
they were among the speakers at a news conference in washington 
thursday sponsored by the alliance against telemarketing fraud 
the alliance in announcing its predictions for the 10 most 
prevalent telemarketing scams this decade warned that crooks and 
con artists are updating their scams for the 1990s 
the decades new con jobs include bogus offers that 
guarantee for a hefty fee to help sell that vacation 
timeshare unit you got stuck with in the 1980s 
in another mortgage acceleration scalpers promise to help 
homeowners save money by paying off their loan obligations early 
but actually wind up costing them much more 
with each change in technology theres a new twist said 
ms golodner of the national consumers league one of the 60 
consumer groups trade associations government agencies 
businesses and labor unions that form the alliance 
the federal trade commission estimates that telemarketing fraud 
has cost consumers 1 billion a year for the last five years 
kansas securities commissioner doug mays went even further 
these people are crooks their weapons are telephones not 
guns he warned adding if you own a telephone then you are a 
potential victim for these people 
the alliances watch list of schemes aimed at relieving us 
consumers of their money includes abusive 1900 long distance 
telephone numbers that charge the unwary several dollars per minute 
often while they are kept on hold for information they could get 
for free 
the industry is trying very hard to police our end of it but 
were only one part of the equation said ken griffin a 
spokesman for american telephone and telegraph co he said atampt 
screens potential 900service customers for credit background and 
other routine information but not for how the phone link will be 
used 
although there are numerous legitimate telemarketers we want 
to warn consumers that con artists are making these types of offers 
through highpressure sales pitches providing little concrete 
information said ms golodner 
richard barton of the direct marketing association a trade 
group of about 3000 telemarketing companies said we believe 
very strongly as an industry that telefraud is very harmful to our 
businesses 
barton who also attended the news conference noted that his 
association maintains a code of ethics but an outright fraudulent 
organization is not going to pay attention to us anyway 
all of the speakers urged consumers to avoid becoming victims by 
checking out offers that sound too good to be true asking for 
explanations in writing hanging up on highpressure salespeople 
and taking their time before agreeing to buy

visitors to this border town shouldnt 
be surprised if the cold canadian beer their host offers them has 
an imported stamp on it these days 
an increasing number of canadians who live near the us border 
have taken to buying their favorite brews in the united states 
where popular canadian beers sell for as little as half the price 
charged back home 
the trend is seriously worrying the managers of beer outlets in 
border towns such as fort erie just across the niagara river from 
buffalo ny they say theyre hamstrung because of government 
controls on price and marketing 
were not on a level playing field said gordon reichett 
manager of the fort erie beer store theres no way for us to do 
anything about the marketing because were limited by the ontario 
liquor control board 
in ontario for example beer may be sold only through beer 
store outlets and provincial liquor stores and prices by law 
must be the same everywhere 
that leaves borderarea beer sellers unable to meet the 
competition from new york supermarkets which use beer as a loss 
leader to lure customers 
we use some beers as draws to get people into the 
stores said mark zee manager of a tops supermarket in buffalo 
we dont lose money on it but we dont make a lot either 
in buffalo canadian brands such as molson golden or labatts 
blue cost about 12 a case including tax deposit and the 
roundtrip toll on the international peace bridge the same beer 
costs 1965 a case at beer store outlets which control 94 percent 
of ontarios beer trade 
the price difference has existed for years but merchants on 
both sides of the border said canadians only began shopping for 
beer in the united states in large numbers about a year ago when 
the canadian dollar strengthened against us dollar and american 
stores began advertising heavily in canada 
reichett said business at his store is off 11 percent from last 
years pace 
sales would be even slower if it werent for us shoppers 
seeking premium highalcohol canadian beers that are unavailable in 
the united states those buyers now make up almost 25 percent of 
his business he says 
the fort erie people are not buying the molson dry and the 
brador and the extra stock ales reichett said its the 
american clientele and thank god for them 
canada customs does not keep statistics on beer imports but 
inspectors at the peace bridge estimate that canadian brands 
account for about 30 percent of the beer that canadians bring back 
from the united states 
jan westcott executive director of the trade group brewers of 
ontario said the problem exists throughout the provinces borders 
with new york michigan and minnesota he said high alcohol taxes 
are the culprit 
if you take 10 worth of tax off and account a little for the 
exchange rate theres not that much difference in the price he 
said we have a very aggressive tax policy with respect to 
alcohol 
even when you add in 680 a case in tax and duty collected by 
canada customs at the border its cheaper to buy beer in new york 
and thats only if shoppers declare their beer some dont and 
many who do say they often are waved through without paying duty 
theyre pretty slack on the bridges these days letting people 
go back and forth with whatever they want said larry shale 
manager of the beer store in niagara falls he said business at his 
store is off almost 20 percent in the past year 
if they were stricter in controlling what goes over the 
bridges that would help us 
customs officials say thats an exaggeration but admit many 
shoppers do get by without paying duty especially on busy days 
we get some days where the traffics backed up across the 
bridge stuart mcleod a canada customs supervisor in fort erie 
theres no way of collecting duty on every single case

w michael blumenthal the former treasury 
secretary who engineered the creation of unisys corp has 
announced his longexpected retirement after a year of losses and 
layoffs that ended on a profitable note 
blumenthal 64 the companys chairman and chief executive 
officer will retire in april to join the investment banking firm 
lazard freres amp co as a limited partner unisys said in a 
statement from detroit where the board of directors met thursday 
the board gave the ceo position to president james a unruh 48 
who also will retain the title of president blumenthal will remain 
chairman of the board 
unisys also reported its fourthquarter profit fell 84 percent 
as a weak us market offset strong international growth and 
previously announced layoffs took a toll 
blumenthal was chairman of bendix corp for five years before 
president jimmy carter named him treasury secretary in 1977 he 
resigned in 1979 to join burroughs corp and was chief executive 
when the detroitbased computer maker took over sperry corp to 
form unisys in 1986 the biggest acquisition ever in the industry 
after almost two decades of managing major industrial 
companies and 10 years at burroughs and unisys the time has come 
for my longplanned retirement blumenthal said in a statement 
for the three months ended dec 31 the company reported net 
income of 34 million or 5 cents a share on a fully diluted basis 
compared with 218 million or 105 a share in the same quarter 
of 1988 
revenue for the fourth quarter totaled 297 billion up 2 
percent from 291 billion a year earlier 
decreases in defense business and us commercial computer 
orders offset doubledigit growth in international orders unisys 
said from its blue bell headquarters the us business was hurt 
temporarily by a 230 million restructuring charge against 
thirdquarter earnings that included the layoff of about 8000 
employees and consolidation of factories the company said 
but the restructuring helped the company return to profitability 
and a positive cash flow from operations after a 6482 million 
loss in the third quarter unisys said 
for all of 1989 unisys reported a loss of 6393 million or 
471 a share in 1988 the company reported a profit of 6806 
million or 327 a share 
revenue for the year rose 2 percent to 1010 billion from 994 
billion 
unisys said inventories were cut 216 million during the quarter 
to 18 billion bringing the years reduction to 723 million the 
company had set a goal of reducing inventories by 500 million 
after they rose 628 million in 1988 to 25 billion 
we are encouraged by the very early results from our 
fundamental cost structure initiatives blumenthal said our 
program is on schedule benefits are expected to accelerate 
gradually with the full impact to be realized in the latter part of 
this year 
unisys will seek to reduce debt by 600 million to 800 million 
in 1990 in part through the sale of nonstrategic and idle assets 
blumenthal said 
overall 1989 was a difficult and disappointing year he 
said we believe we have made progress against problems unique to 
unisys such as the high inventory position entering 1989 and we 
moved decisively to adapt to the rapidly emerging new economic 
model for the industry in the 1990s these actions will facilitate 
additional progress in the implementation of our strategic plans

ual corp is encouraging united airlines 
employees to work up a formal buyout proposal for the parent 
company but still is keeping other options open 
the board for example opened the door thursday to a new bid 
from los angeles billionaire marvin davis it also said it will 
continue to explore a possible recapitalization rather than a 
buyout as a means of boosting its stock price 
separately ual underscored the financial cost of the 
6monthold ownership contest when it reported a 67 percent plunge 
in its fourthquarter earnings due largely to 60 million in 
buyout expenses 
after meeting at uals chicagoarea headquarters on thursday 
uals directors issued a statement saying a plan outlined by 
uniteds three labor unions on wednesday to acquire 75 percent of 
the carrier did not constitute an acquisition proposal 
the board instructed its legal and financial advisers to work 
with the unions in developing a formal bid 
the board also said it would consider any acquisition proposal 
made by the employee group or any third party when any such 
proposal is made 
the statement also said the board was releasing davis and 
british airways plc from agreements they signed last summer 
prohibiting them from making takeover offers of less than 300 a 
share 
davis first put ual in play last august with an unsolicited 
offer of 200 a share or 432 billion 
uals board later accepted a 300ashare 675billion offer 
from uniteds management and pilots with british airways as an 
equity partner 
that offer collapsed in october when banks refused to finance 
it precipitating a 190point plunge in the stock market 
analysts said ual may have released the parties from the 
restrictions both to avoid future lawsuits should the company be 
sold to its workers for less than 300 a share and to open up the 
field to all comers 
i think they genuinely want to get this thing over with and i 
think its fair to open the door to any and all who want to bid on 
the company said analyst stephen dexter of kemper financial 
services inc in chicago 
davis sources last week denied a report in business week 
magazine that davis was preparing a 250ashare offer for ual 
the california investor did not immediately return calls seeking 
comment on thursdays development nor did spokesmen for uniteds 
unions 
british airways spokesman sandy gardiner said his company had no 
plans to participate in a new bid for ual 
uals stock fell 3 to 15850 thursday in new york stock 
exchange trading 
the buyout proposal revealed wednesday by uniteds unionized 
pilots flight attendants and machinists would put 75 percent of 
uals stock in employees hands creating the countrys largest 
employeecontrolled company 
the unions have said they will take pay cuts and sign fiveyear 
contracts in return for majority ownership of the nations 
secondlargest airline 
but the proposal left many key issues open including the 
structure financing and price of a buyout and the role of chairman 
stephen wolf in an employeecontrolled ual 
meanwhile ual on thursday reported net income fell to 68 
million or 31 cents a share in the three months ended dec 31 
compared with 209 million or 97 cents a share for the same 
period of 1988 revenues rose to 24 billion from 22 billion 
fourthquarter expenses of 60 million related to the failed 
buyout bid were offset partially by a 407 million gain from stock 
appreciation rights also linked to the buyout attempt the company 
said those pretax items combined to depress fourth quarter 
earnings by 116 million 
a 34 percent increase in jet fuel costs also depressed earnings 
ual said 
for all of 1989 ual reported net income of 3242 million or 
1496 per share down 71 percent from 11 billion or 3787 per 
share in 1988 revenues last year totaled 98 billion compared 
with 9 billion in 1988 
ual said 1988 earnings were boosted by a 393 million pretax 
gain from the partial sale of its covia automated reservations 
system and a 5239 million gain from the january 1988 sale of 
westin hotel co

a federal bankruptcy judge promises swift 
action to help ensure that federated department stores inc and 
allied stores corp keep their shelves stocked and registers 
ringing during chapter 11 reoganization 
it will be full speed ahead in this case us bankruptcy 
judge j vincent aug jr said thursday 
aug gave the two retailers approval to continue funding benefits 
for their 100000 employees he also granted interim approval to 
draw on loans that federated and allied said they need to buy 
spring merchandise and hold their market shares against competitors 
james zimmerman president of federated stores inc parent 
company of allied and federated said the interim funding would 
allow the companys nine department store chains to continue 
business 
aug said he sympathized with us trustee conrad j morgenstern 
and creditors lawyers who argued for delays to give them time to 
go through the bulky financial agreements the retailers propose 
morgenstern who is helping steer the companies through the 
reorganization proceedings said his office has been so swamped 
that his staff will not be able to start assembling a creditors 
committee until next week 
i realize its going to put a tremendous burden on everybody 
in this room but lets face it there are no babes in the 
woods here aug told a courtroom packed with lawyers for major 
banks and other creditors were going to come to a decision in 
this case on the financing sooner rather than later 
aug approved federated and allied payments for health and 
disability insurance drug and alcohol abuse counseling employee 
educational programs and a company savings plan 
david heiman a lawyer for federated and allied said the 
payments would total more than 5 million but he said the 
companies dont know how much all of the programs will cost 
warren n rothman a federated and allied vice president for 
benefits said paying the benefits that employees earned before the 
retailers sought bankruptcy court protection would help boost 
employee confidence 
thursdays hearings were the first for the retailing divisions 
of torontobased campeau corp since they filed for protection from 
creditors on jan 15 listing debts of 75 billion it is the 
biggest chapter 11 filing in american retailing history brought on 
by debts amassed when campeau bought allied in 1986 and federated 
in 1988 
under chapter 11 the companies must get court approval to pay 
operating expenses and other bills 
aug granted federated and allied permission to draw immediately 
on bank financing to ensure shipments of imported spring 
merchandise 
federated received interim approval to use up to 50 million for 
letters of credit allied got interim approval to use up to 50 
million in working capital and 80 million in merchandise financing 
aug scheduled final hearings on the financing arrangements in 
cincinnati on feb 8 for federated and feb 9 for allied 
john zeiger a federatedallied lawyer persuaded aug not to 
delay final hearings on the bank financing agreements zeiger said 
provisions of the agreements permit the banks to withdraw from 
their commitments if the financing doesnt receive court approval 
by feb 14 
another week will be a killer on the business of allied and 
federated zeiger said thats why weve pushed as hard as we 
have 
harvey miller a lawyer for the citibankled bank consortium 
that has agreed to provide federated with 400 million in 
financing said the group includes more than 100 banks 60 percent 
of them foreign he said it would be difficult to recruit new 
supporting banks if the feb 14 expiration date passed 
allied negotiated a 300 million financing agreement with 
chemical bank 
the judge also ruled that federated and allied may maintain 
credit lines they had before the chapter 11 reorganization 
petitions were filed federated has a 1 billion credit facility 
and allied 700 million both through new yorks citibank 
he also approved federateds request to be allowed to continue 
to sell allied computerized credit services and aug permitted the 
resumption of 20 percent store discounts to federated and allied 
retirees and 600000 in bonuses promised to some employees of 
federateds bloomingdales chain

fox broadcasting co will ask the federal 
communications commission to allow it to develop into a true 
fourth network to compete with nbc abc and cbs free of rules 
that restrict network programs and sales 
fox inc chairman barry diller in washington thursday to press 
his case on capitol hill and at the fcc said his company on 
tuesday will ask the commission to relax socalled financial 
interest and syndication rules on networks 
the fcc defines a network among other things as a company that 
broadcasts at least 15 hours of television programs a week fox 
broadcasting the scrappy threeyearold company that has won a 
loyal following with such shows as 21 jump street married 
with children and gritty reality programs expects to 
achieve network status in september 
besides asking the fcc to change the rules called finsyn 
rules in the industry fox also wants a waiver from the 15hour 
programming limit so it can continue to grow diller said 
fox also wants the fcc to revise its definition of a network 
said diller 
the finsyn rules prohibit a tv network from selling to 
independent stations programs that have been presented on the 
network they also prohibit a network from having a financial 
interest in programs it does not solely produce 
fox has been airing its shows on its seven owned stations and is 
selling them to an affiliate network and to nonfoxaffiliated 
stations the selling to nonaffiliated stations would stop if fox 
qualified as a network 
fox officials claim the rules are antiquated in an era of 
multinational media conglomerates and that they stifle competition 
i think there is sympathy for our position diller said 
after his meetings we are providing the first competition to the 
three television networks in 40 years and it has been the stated 
policy of the fcc going back 40 years to do everything they could 
to encourage the development of a fourth network 
the fcc in 1983 suspended its investigation into the network 
rules after thenpresident ronald reagan intervened on behalf of 
his former colleagues in hollywood production circles 
fcc commissioner james quello after meeting with diller and 
other top fox officials predicted it would be a very close 
call whether the commission takes up the companys request 
theres a lot of merit on both sides quello said in a 
telephone interview 
congress and the fcc have said they would prefer that hollywood 
and the tv networks work out a new agreement on finsyn rules 
the rules are under attack by the three major tv networks which 
have been foreclosed from the multibilliondollar market for 
network reruns on local stations 
hollywood tv producers following a network run of their shows 
can reap huge sums in the syndication market the networks have 
been conducting lengthy and so far fruitless negotiations with 
hollywood television producers on new regulations 
nbc president robert wright has complained to house energy and 
commerce committee chairman john dingell dmich the rules make 
it more difficult for american networks to compete with overseas 
companies that can produce own and syndicate their programs

the chairmen of congress two budget 
committees want the government to change the way it tries to cut 
the federal deficit adding their voices to the growing chorus that 
says the current system doesnt work 
the two democrats rep leon panetta of california and james 
sasser of tennessee proposed separate plans on thursday to scrap 
the oftderided grammrudman deficitreduction law and replace it 
with other mechanisms 
grammrudman is no longer part of the solution panetta told 
reporters it has become part of the problem 
the proposals come amid increasing dissatisfaction in congress 
with the credibility of the budget process 
sassers plan would dangle the possibility of 17 billion in 
cuts in the social security payroll tax as a reward for each year 
lawmakers enact 30 billion in budget savings 
with this shift every working man and woman in america will 
become part of a constituency for fiscal responsibility because 
they have something to gain from deficit reduction sasser told 
reporters 
panettas idea would lower the amount of deficit reduction 
required each year but stiffen the rules by which the cuts are 
calculated and achieve a balanced budget by 1998 he said 
interest in budget honesty has been galvanized by sen daniel 
patrick moynihan dny he has sought to justify his plan to slash 
the social security tax by contending that the retirement systems 
huge surpluses make the overall federal deficit seem smaller than 
it really is 
bipartisan criticism also has been leveled at grammrudman 
which requires a series of declining deficit targets culminating in 
a balanced budget in 1993 
legislation enacted last year that claimed a savings of nearly 
2 billion simply by shifting the moneylosing postal service off 
budget was merely the latest device budget writers have devised 
to evade the laws intent the actual deficit has exceeded 
grammrudmans targets every year since the legislation was passed 
in 1985 
grammrudman simply rewards on a yeartoyear basis the big 
lie sasser told reporters 
both panettas and sassers plans would abandon the automatic 
spending cuts that grammrudman requires in most federal programs 
should the laws deficit targets not be technically met 
sassers proposal would require congress and the president to 
agree to 30 billion in deficit reduction each year it does not 
address how those savings would be found the key question that 
bedevils lawmakers and the administration every year 
if the savings target were achieved separate legislation would 
be considered paring the social security tax by 17 billion for 
that year 
sasser said his plan would result in a budget surplus by 1997 
he said it also would save workers and employers who pay the 
social security levy 475 billion over seven years or an average 
of 600 a year per worker 
panettas plan would require about 30 billion per year in 
deficit reduction through 1993 and about 20 billion annually 
after that until the budget is balanced 
any spending increases or tax cuts would have to be offset by 
equal savings gimmicks such as moving payments out of a fiscal 
year to make the deficit appear smaller would be forbidden 
panetta would not permit the social security trust fund 
surpluses to be used to make the deficit appear smaller

the bush administration should do a better job 
coordinating the sale of federally owned properties or face the 
real danger of depressing fragile real estate markets 
congressional auditors warn 
the resolution trust corp a new agency created this summer to 
dispose of as much as 300 billion in assets from failed sampls is 
prohibited from dumping the property selling real estate too fast 
for too little money 
but other agencies with vast residential real estate holdings 
such as the veterans and housing departments are not restricted 
and may try to beat the rtc to the market the general accounting 
office said thursday 
a real danger is that the enormous amount of real estate 
assets in federal inventories could tempt some federal agencies to 
quickly reduce holdings in anticipation of a growing surplus in 
real estate markets that may occur once the rtc begins to actively 
market its assets gao assistant comptroller richard l fogel 
told the house banking committee 
such a development could depress real estate markets 
generally he warned 
a plan for the sampl bailout prepared by an administration 
oversight board sheds little light on how asset management and 
disposition efforts will be coordinated and harmonized across the 
federal government fogel said 
however diane casey a spokeswoman for the oversight board 
said the rtc has been instructed to consult with other agencies and 
has already begun meeting with them 
the gao the auditing and investigative arm of congress also 
criticized the federal deposit insurance corp for failing to 
properly monitor billions of dollars of government assistance going 
to sampls that were rescued in 1988 by the nowdefunct federal 
savings and loan insurance corp 
the cost of the assistance approaches 40 billion yet the fdic 
has not given sufficient priority to managing it fogel 
said 
audits assessing the condition of bailedout thrifts and the 
governments likely liabilities were supposed to be finished for 
the most part by the middle of last year but only nine of 152 
required audits are complete fogel said 
meanwhile the congressional budget office confirming an 
earlier warning from fdic and rtc chairman l william seidman said 
the cost of the sampl bailout is quite likely to exceed the 50 
billion allotted 
the rtc is supposed to handle any thrifts failing before august 
1992 but probably wont have enough money to do that said james 
l blum assistant director of the budget office 
that means the new savings association insurance fund which 
will have 16 billion to spend from 1992 through 1999 will have 
insufficient funds he said 
the government would be left in the position of having to keep 
insolvent sampls open because it lacked the money to close them just 
as it was before the bailout bill passed 
rep henry b gonzalez dtexas chairman of the banking panel 
urged the administration to face this reality and come to 
congress with a realistic appraisal of rtcs funding needs as soon 
as possible rather than slowing down the rtcs activities and 
increasing the costs to taxpayers

american consumers who want to know exactly 
whats in their food may have to go shopping overseas to find out 
says a consumer advocacy group 
the center for science in the public interest said thursday that 
us food companies are providing some foreign consumers with food 
labeling details the firms have opposed in the united states as too 
costly and intrusive 
the labels of almost all processed foods sold in thailand 
including wellknown american products disclose the percentage 
of each major ingredient contained in the product said cspi in a 
written statement 
such labeling would reveal for example the percentage of oil 
in peanut butter sugar in a candy bar or flour in a cake 
among the products cited by the center as containing more 
detailed labeling abroad was kelloggs frosted flakes breakfast 
cereal 
joseph m stewart spokesman for the michiganbased kellogg co 
said percentage labeling could mislead consumers who are trying to 
reduce their intake of certain dietary substances we dont eat 
on a percentage basis he said 
for instance stewart said a 12ounce can of cola contains 39 
grams or 11 percent sugar by comparison the 11 grams of sugar 
in a oneounce serving of frosted flakes would equal 39 percent of 
its content 
the difference is explained by the lighter weight of the flakes 
when compared to the weight of the water in the cola stewart said 
at the moment you decide to eat the one with 11 percent sugar 
over the one with 39 percent you will have committed the sin of 
percentage labeling said stewart 
stewart said kellogg was complying with thai government 
regulations but opposed such requirements by the us government 
i never expected to find american products with that kind of 
labeling said bruce silverglade cspi legal director in a 
telephone interview 
silverglade said he discovered the detailed labeling in a thai 
grocery store last summer when he went in to purchase bottled water 
alan goldberg a spokesman for the grocery manufacturers of 
america said the food trade group opposes percentageingredient 
labeling on us food products and we will continue to based on 
propriety information and trade secrets said goldberg 
its not in the consumer interest to put that kind of clutter 
and detail on labels said roger coleman a spokesman for the 
national food processors association 
to do this kind of labeling does nothing but add to the cost 
and confusion for consumers said coleman 
it is ironic that as us food companies work to keep this 
information secret at home they have been providing the very same 
information to consumers overseas said robert parrish a cspi 
staff attorney 
consumer food industry and governmental groups already are 
wrangling over legislation that would strengthen and make mandatory 
nutrition labeling the amount of calories proteins fats and 
other microingredients for all foods

the terminally ill and those facing permanent confinement to 
nursing homes have a new source of help to pay their skyrocketing 
bills benefits from life insurance policies that usually are paid 
after they die 
the prudential insurance co of america intended to announce 
today its living needs benefit program the first massmarket 
plan that lets policyholders tap into their death benefits while 
they are still living 
prudential will pay close to the face value of a policy if a 
doctor certifies the policyholder has less than six months to live 
or has been in a nursing home for six months with little hope of 
leaving 
the world is changing in many ways prudential president 
joseph melone said people are living longer and the medical 
treatment that is keeping them alive is getting expensive these 
are real market needs that should be met 
prudential said the new program will be available to current 
policyholders with death benefits of 25000 new customers with 
policies of 50000 also can qualify there will be no additional 
cost for the service other than a small processing charge if a 
claim is made 
regulators in 10 states have already given the company 
permission to offer the program the company plans to expand the 
program to cover some 3 million policyholders throughout the 
country 
the 10 states alabama alaska arizona colorado florida 
idaho kentucky montana new jersey and west virginia 
once the company receives medical certification it will assess 
the policy figuring in the amount of interest the company will 
lose for making the early payment and deducting it from the 
policys face value 
for example the company is looking into the case of a 
57yearold electrician with a terminal bone marrow disease the 
man has three life insurance policies that would pay 186795 on 
his death 
under the new program the man could collect 184184 or a 
lesser figure with the balance to be paid to a beneficiary after 
his death 
robert hill prudentials senior vice president and actuary 
said prior to the program the man would only be able to get 73965 
before his death by cashing in the policy for whatever interest had 
accrued 
similarly a hypothetical policyholder confined to a nursing 
home carries a policy that would pay 229340 at the time of his 
death under the prudential program the man could collect the 
money in 60 monthly payments of 3810 for a total of 228600 
if he cashed in the policy he would receive 163989 
although melone stressed the prudential program is no solution 
to the catastrophic care issue facing the nation he said it would 
provide an added safety net to policyholders 
the main purpose of life insurance was the unexpected death 
he said what we are talking about here is another very 
meaningful use of a life insurance benefit 
prudentials move comes after a yearlong experiment at its 
canadian subsidiary which provided advanced payment of death 
benefits to 14 policyholders many of them suffering from aids 
other companies have taken cautious steps toward accelerated 
benefit payments 
for the past year the metropolitan life insurance co has 
offered a life insurance rider that pays 30 percent of a policys 
face value if the policyholder is the victim of cancer a severe 
heart attack alzheimers disease or a variety of other serious 
illnesses the rider costs an additional 10 percent of the premium 
much to my surprise it has not produced a significant amount 
of sales said gerry goldsholle chief brokerage executive for 
metropolitan lifes life insurance subsidiary 
goldsholle said his company was studying a program similar to 
prudentials 
john booth vice president and chief actuary for the american 
council of life insurance said living benefits has been a 
longdiscussed issue in the industry but no one has acted 
there are many reasons to introduce such a program an 
insurance company like prudential must negotiate a maze of 
different state regulations in some states like new york 
insurance laws must be rewritten to allow the plan there is also a 
question of taxes while there are no taxes on death benefits it 
is uncertain whether early payment of benefits would be taxable 
booth said other companies may overcome their hesitation after 
watching prudentials program 
if this gives prudential new sales and hurts their 
competitors the competitors are sure to run out and do the same 
thing he said

lawyers usually do the bickering in society but 
they may become the subject of the next round of trade bickering 
between the united states and japan 
almost two years after japan opened its doors to foreign 
lawyers us attorneys say barriers impede their business here 
japanese lawyers charge americans want to make japan over in its 
own legal image 
on thursday members of the japanese bar association and 
representatives of four us bar associations including those of 
new york city and california met to discuss the restrictions 
japan will continue to try to resolve these difficult issues 
but right now we cant say yes or no said go kajitani deputy 
secretarygeneral of the japanese bar association 
but us lawyers and government officials who attended the 
private talks said the japanese lawyers group which supervises 
both japanese and foreign lawyers in japan resisted any changes to 
the 1987 law that authorized foreign lawyers to work here 
foreign lawyers have a list of grievances they cannot hire or 
forge partnerships with japanese lawyers to facilitate advising 
their foreign clients about japanese law they are also generally 
barred from arbitration proceedings where most legal wrangles in 
japan are resolved thus missing out on considerable business 
and they say a requirement that foreign lawyers have at least 
five years of experience in their home countries means they can 
send only their experienced and most expensive lawyers to tokyo 
these barriers prevent american lawyers from providing 
firstrate legal services to help foreign enterprises fight it out 
in the relatively closed and difficult japanese market us 
lawyers and officials say 
these restrictions constitute an important nontariff trade 
barrier because right now foreign companies cannot go out into 
the market and get the kind of legal services they need said ned 
perry chairman of a legal services committee of the american 
chamber of commerce in japan 
foreign companies can seek the advice of japanese lawyers 
called bengoshi but many us lawyers here say bengoshi are not 
trained to be advocates for their clients like american or european 
lawyers are 
a us official said access of us lawyers to the japanese 
system is a trade priority for the united states the us 
government has requested cabinetlevel talks on the issue in late 
february 
the issue is a familiar one to top us trade officials trade 
representative carla hills was a private lawyer in washington 
before being tapped for the cabinet post and s linn williams 
hills deputy in charge of japan opened his california law firms 
office in tokyo in 1987 
of the 57 foreign lawyers who have registered to practice in 
japan since april 1987 almost twothirds are american 
japanese bar association members opposed the opening from the 
beginning saying they feared an increase of lawsuits in japan and 
an unwelcome tinkering with the way justice is administered here 
which depends more on mediation of disputes than the us 
adversarial system 
but no flood of foreign lawyers has materialized and lawyers 
say they are not asking to represent clients in japanese courts 
japanese lawyers are merely drumming up this kind of fear to 
protect their own positions said the us official who spoke on 
condition of anonymity 
with just under 14000 lawyers in japan compared to 100000 in 
the state of california alone there is little competition among 
japanese lawyers who are generally affluent and revered as 
professionals 
other us attorneys say the japanese fear bicultural law firms 
headed by americans will dominate international law in japan as 
they did for a decade immediately after world war ii beginning in 
1955 foreign lawyers were forbidden from working here except as 
trainees at japanese law firms 
but some japanese lawyers see the issue as a further us 
encroachment on the japanese system 
america will not be satisfied until japan overhauls its laws 
and regulations to guarantee american companies the same freedoms 
in japan that they enjoy at home wrote lawyer takeshi suzuki in 
the journal japan echo 
another rule foreign lawyers complain about is that they are not 
allowed to call themselves by their real names they must use the 
names of their resident partners followed by a japanese phrase 
meaning foreign business lawyer followed by the name the firm is 
known by at home 
this not only takes up a lot of space on office stationery but 
robs a law firm of the powerful advertising value of its name a 
us official says the problem will likely be resolved soon

opened up markets for investors but until thursdays announcement

interest in a hungarian light bulb company have stepped forward 
with largescale investments 
the reforms have opened what used to be closed markets to 
potential western investors in other countries such as poland

swiss watch exports jumped 20 percent 
in 1989 to a record high of more than 4 billion the association 
of swiss watchmakers said friday 
the association said swiss watch output now accounts for about 
50 percent of world production dominating the more expensive end 
of the world market 
exports to japan one of switzerlands major watchmaking rivals 
surged 70 percent to 295 million as a result the japanese 
overtook the french as the fifth largest customer the association 
said 
hong kong remains the most important market for swiss watches 
exports to the british crown colony topped 660 million in 1989 
the united states followed with purchases worth 560 million 
italy with 423 million and west germany with 327 million the 
association said 
the watchmakers association said while the number of watches 
sold last year rose only 6 percent the value soared because of the 
increase in demand for more exclusive models 
the average price for swiss watch and watch parts leaving the 
factory was 53 compared with 870 in japan and only 3 in hong 
kong the association said 
a total 425 million watches and watch parts were exported last

union representatives for usairs 6000 
pilots have accepted a proposed contract ending 17 months of 
negotiations with the carrier 
elected members of the air line pilots association met for 10 
hours at a hotel here thursday before ratifying the contract the 
first for the combined pilot staffs of usair and piedmont airlines 
alpa spokesman chris beebe said the contract provides slightly 
better pay for junior pilots improved retirement benefits for 
pilots who were with usair before the merger with piedmont and 
strengthened language to prevent usair from hiring pilots at lower 
pay to fly some classes of airplanes 
but beebe said usair gave little ground on many of the contract 
issues 
id say we are not overjoyed but we are comfortable with the 
contract he said 
the contract comes a day after usair reported a 63 million loss 
for 1989 including a surprising 102 million loss in the fourth 
quarter 
usair chairman edwin colodny told industry analysts last week 
that concluding negotiations with several labor groups is a top 
priority for usair in 1990 
the carrier is still negotiating with two unions representing 
its flight attendants and mechanics baggage handlers conclude a 
vote jan 31 on whether to continue representation by the teamsters 
union 
analysts agree the airline needs to get on to other business 
the hope of the union leaders is to now work with the 
company to help make this the profitable dependable and customer 
airline we all hope it will be said beebe 
the union representatives voted 1512 to accept the contract 
but beebe said the group decided against sending the contract to a 
vote of its atlarge membership the union had the option of 
ratifying the contract itself 
pilots who had been with usair had been without a contract since 
august 1988 former piedmont pilots contract ran out in october 
1989

the us economy hurt by slumping consumer 
demand grew just 05 percent in the final three months of 1989 for 
the poorest showing in more than three years the government said 
today 
the meager performance of the gross national product the total 
output of goods and services was certain to fan the debate over 
whether the country is in danger of toppling into a recession 
the gnp for all of 1989 rose a moderate 29 percent this 
followed growth of 44 percent in 1988 and was the slowest annual 
increase since a 27 percent rise in 1986 
while most private economists say the united states will be able 
to avoid an outright downturn a more pessimistic minority noted 
that the government statistics are subject to wide revisions and 
that todays growth rate could be lowered in coming months 
possibly to a negative number 
a recession usually is defined as two consecutive quarterly 
declines in the gnp 
the gnp report shows the economy ground to a virtual halt in 
the fourth quarter with signs of weakness everywhere said allen 
sinai chief economist of the boston co the economy is flirting 
with a recession 
but the administration which is counting on a rebound in growth 
to provide badly needed government revenues was more upbeat in its 
assessment of the gnp report 
michael boskin chairman of president bushs council of economic 
advisers blamed part of the fourthquarter slowdown on onetime 
factors such as the unusually cold december weather the boeing 
aircraft strike and the effects of hurricane hugo and the san 
francisco bay area earthquake 
boskin predicted a period of slower growth in the months 
ahead but he said the economy would rebound later in the year 
and while not ruling out a recession the presidents chief 
economist said i believe its unlikely 
he said the low growth figures could have a modest impact on 
the fiscal 1991 budget that bush unveils on monday making it 
harder to meet the goal of reducing the federal deficit to the 64 
billion required under the gramkmrudman budget balancing law 
but boskin suggested that rebounding growth later in the year 
would cancel any negative impact on the budget 
the 05 percent growth in the fourth quarter marked the 
economys weakest showing since a decline of 18 percent in the 
second quarter of 1986 
however after that one downturn economic activity rebounded 
helped in large part by a boom in us export sales that lifted the 
fortunes of american manufacturers 
but with the improvement in trade deficit slowing dramatically 
this year manufacturing unemployment has begun to rise again 
in a separate report showing further weakness the government 
said that orders to us factories for durable goods items 
expected to last more than three years rose just 59 percent for 
all of 1989 half of the 1988 increase 
on the inflation front prices as measured by an index tied to 
the gnp rose 45 percent in 1989 that was the fastest increase 
since a 62 percent jump in 1982 
the biggest drag on economic activity in the fourth quarter was 
a huge swing in consumer spending which posted a rare decline of 
01 percent reflecting a big drop in demand for new autos 
it was the first decline in consumer spending in two years and 
came after a giant 56 percent jump in the julyseptember quarter 
when consumers had rushed to buy cars to take advantage of discount 
pricing 
since consumer spending accounts for twothirds of all economic 
activity the big swing in this category had a major dampening 
effect on economic activity 
other areas of weakness included the second consecutive quarter 
in which the trade deficit worsened reflecting stronger growth in 
imports than exports 
business investment for expansion and modernization which had 
been a key source of strength dropped by 3 percent in the fourth 
quarter for the first decline in a year military spending fell by 
54 billion the biggest setback since the first quarter of 1989 
in one of the few signs of strength the gnp report showed that 
housing construction which had fallen for three consecutive 
quarters rose a modest 26 percent in the septemberdecember 
period 
it was a sign that the credit easing engineered by the federal 
reserve board are beginning to bolster the fortunes of the housing 
industry 
economists who believe the nations sevenyear economic 
expansion will continue are counting on the fed to ride to the 
rescue with further moves to lower interest rates and bolster 
economic growth 
but even optimistic forecasters believe growth this year will be 
quite sluggish with the gnp expected to rise by only 18 percent 
this is significantly lower than the projection of the bush 
administration which is counting on stronger growth to help the 
president keep his pledge of reducing the budget deficit without 
raising taxes 
the congressional budget office siding with the more 
pessimistic private forecasters projected a 1991 deficit of 138 
billion far above the 64 billion deficit limit set by the 
grammrudman balancedbudget law

the stock markets january tailspin has been 
especially dizzying for investors who had been caught up in the 
highflying hopes engendered last fall by the political upheaval in 
eastern europe 
now the letdown has many market participants wondering whether 
they erred in trying to cash in the peace dividend too long 
before it ever had a chance to be declared 
in the waning days of 1989 many wall streeters began a crash 
course of study into the prospective economic benefits that might 
arise from the spread of democracy behind the iron curtain 
the headlines stirred visions of vast new markets in eastern 
europe for many types of goods and services and of relief at home 
for the strained federal budget in the form of reduced federal 
spending 
all these hopes may prove to have a substantial basis in 
reality many analysts still say but they caution that it is easy 
for investors to get carried away any time they are confronted with 
historic changes 
in addition they note market history shows that even concrete 
signs of peace in the making dont automatically translate into a 
rapid increase in stock prices 
some veterans recall that a market top in early 1973 on the eve 
of a twoyear bear market came just as signs were emerging of an 
end to the long war in vietnam 
while the spread of capitalism bodes for bullish developments 
in the decades ahead the transition will be painfully slow and 
expensive says james stack editor of the investech market 
analyst advisory letter 
we think investor expectations have already surpassed the 
realistic benefits for the next few years 
suresh bhirud chief portfolio strategist at oppenheimer amp co 
doesnt seek to minimize the importance of what has happened 
its a wonderful surprise that the threat of a major world 
conflict has diminished significantly for the foreseeable future 
he observes 
if these countries achieve some stability we would expect a 
resurgence in demand for consumer products capital goods and 
goods and services related to infrastructure construction this 
would be icing on the cake for the world economy which is already 
much stronger than it was in the 1970s 
there are some caveats however if the move towards economic 
reform continues in most of eastern europe extraordinary demand 
for consumer goods and food commodities will be created which 
could lead to strong inflationary pressures 
in addition if political turmoil spreads to the more volatile 
areas of the world nearterm shortages of key raw materials could 
develop 
thus it is quite possible that the euphoria surrounding the 
outlook for the 1990s while probably justified from a longerterm 
standpoint could be premature in terms of 1990 or even 1991 
even in the midst of a broad market setback some fastmoving 
speculators have reaped handsome payoffs from the search for 
plays on eastern europe

federal thrift officials said today they are 
seeking a cease and desist order against neil bush one day after 
the presidents son rejected a settlement over his role as a 
director of a collapsed savings and loan 
neil bushs actions as a director of silverado banking savings 
and loan association of denver amounted to conflicts of interest 
said the enforcement review committee of the office of thrift 
supervision in washington dc 
the case will be heard by an administrative law judge if the 
order is granted the younger bush would be barred from practices 
that could constitute a conflict of interest if he ever serves 
again with a federally insured financial institution 
bush said thursday the office of thrift and supervision had 
proposed the cease and desist order but he had rejected it because 
it would imply that he had acted improperly 
in my view a settlement agreement would leave an implication 
that i misbehaved as a director of silverado bush said in a 
statement 
as i have said in the past i have nothing to hide and i have 
done nothing wrong he said therefore i have refused to 
consent to any agreement with the office of thrift supervision and 
if they choose to bring action against me i will fight the matter 
in court 
bush 34 served as a director of silverado from 1985 to august 
1988 resigning two weeks after his father got the gop presidential 
nomination 
the collapse of silverado now operating as part of columbia 
savings the largest thrift in colorado is expected to cost 
taxpayers up to 1 billion 
karl hoyle senior deputy director of the office of thrift 
supervision said in washington late thursday that bushs lawyers 
had told the agency bush intends to contest the allegations of 
conflict of interest made by thrift regulators 
hoyle said the agency wouldnt seek a more severe penalty which 
would ban bush from ever working for a federally insured financial 
institution because the office didnt believe it had grounds to 
seek it that penalty has been imposed on five former silverado 
officers 
in a related matter the federal deposit insurance corporation 
is considering whether to sue silverado officers and directors 
including bush for damages for losses to the taxpayers in the 
bailout 
the office of thrift supervision said examiners had expressed 
grave concern about silverados operations particularly its 
heavy investment in colorados ailing commercial real estate market 
they also have focused their investigation on what they said was 
an exceptionally large number of problem transactions between 
silverado insiders and borrowers 
bush who was a partner in an oil exploration firm jnb 
exploration had business deals with two of silverados major 
borrowers developers bill l walters and ken good 
bill walters had a passive 625 percent limited partnership 
interest in jnb exploration bush said because i did not 
benefit directly or indirectly from any loan or transaction between 
silverado and businesses controlled by bill walters as an outside 
director i voted in 1986 with the other directors in unanimously 
approving the walters loans and transactions brought to us by 
management 
i voted because there was no conflict of interest under the 
federal banking laws and regulations or under the laws of 
colorado bush said 
good according to bush had a more active interest in the 
financing and management of jnb exploration and as a result i 
abstained on all votes concerning good the other board members 
unanimously approved the transactions with good bush said 
he said both walters and goods relationships with silverado 
as borrowers and preferred shareholders were established before he 
became a director 
their relationships with my company which began in 1983 also 
preceded my silverado board appointment bush said 
a former federal sampl examiner james moroney has alleged that 
regulators dragged their feet on silverado because of bushs 
presence on the institutions board and other political 
connections but regulators in washington have said they 
investigated moroneys allegations and found them invalid bush has 
said he never sought to use his political connections and wouldnt 
have if asked

the japanese have gotten slammed by some 
americans for their highly visible investments in us business 
properties ranging from columbia pictures to rockefeller center 
but this past weeks slump in bond prices suggests that the us 
government and those holding its debt should put out the welcome 
mat for japanese investors in treasury securities 
over the past few years the japanese have been steady and 
substantial customers at the quarterly securities sales where the 
government has borrowed heavily to finance its expanding debt 
market watchers estimate the japanese typically buy 25 percent 
to 35 percent of new treasury issues maturing in 10 to 30 years 
as a result some analysts argue the government has been able 
to peddle its securities at lower rates of interest than it would 
have to pay otherwise 
but worries about whether japanese investors will be big buyers 
of the treasurys expected 30 billion auction of new securities 
next month have weighed heavily on bond prices 
those concerns have stemmed from a recent rise in japanese 
interest rates that has narrowed the difference in yields available 
on japanese securities relative to us notes and bonds 
william griggs a partner with the investment firm griggs amp 
santow inc said 10year japanese notes for example were 
yielding about 135 percentage points below the yields on 10year 
treasury notes earlier this month compared with a 2 percentage 
point difference at the start of the year 
while the difference in yields has since widened toward 2 
percentage points once again in more recent days william v 
sullivan jr of dean witter reynolds said the more typical yield 
spread has been 25 to 3 percentage points 
the fear among us bondholders is that some japanese investors 
will find the current yields in japan rewarding enough that they 
will decide against taking the extra risks involved in converting 
yen to dollars and buying treasury issues 
that could drive us rates higher depressing the value of 
bonds already trading in the market 
the realities of what can happen when foreign investors sit out 
a bond auction were illustrated this past tuesday when the 
resolution funding corp had to pay higher rates than many market 
professionals had anticipated to find buyers for its 5 billion 
issue of 40year thrift bailout bonds 
the japanese had not been expected to bid on the bonds which 
carry maturities of 10 years later than the treasurys longest 
security and are expected to be far less readily salable than 
treasury issues 
we didnt expect the japanese to be there and they werent 
said robert brusca economist for nikko securities international in 
new york 
he said no conclusions should be drawn from the absence of the 
japanese from the 40year auction relative to what may happen at 
the treasury auctions expected to be conducted in early february 
but some traders said the auction illustrated nonetheless that 
interest rates must often go higher than expected when the pool of 
bidders is smaller 
prices of long bonds tumbled in the wake of the 40year auction 
and got another jolt on thursday that reflected traders 
sensitivity to the importance of foreign investment in the us 
bond market 
bond prices careened lower after some press reports suggested 
federal reserve chairman alan greenspan had indicated he might 
consider the idea of reinstating a withholding tax on investment 
income earned here by foreigners the federal reserve later said 
greenspan did not favor such action 
but the market failed to revive anyway and prices lost more 
ground friday in the wake of a strongerthanexpected report on 
durable goods orders in december 
by midafternoon friday prices of 30year treasury bonds were 
down more than 25 for every 1000 in face value for the week 
their yield had risen to 854 percent from 826 percent at trhe end 
of the previous friday 
griggs suspected yields were getting high enough that japanese 
interest in the upcoming auctions will be strong 
but sullivan said it is still too early to tell we have a a 
long way to go until we bid these secutiries he said

grain and soybean futures prices closed mostly 
lower friday on the chicago board of trade amid slack foreign 
demand for us grain 
wheat futures also were pressured by improved growing conditions 
in the us winter wheat belt where recent rains and snowfall have 
helped to relieve extreme dryness 
the action marked the third daily acrosstheboard decline in as 
many sessions as prospects for a pickup in export sales have 
dimmed 
mild temperatures this month have slowed demand both 
domestically and abroad for corn and soybean meal as livestock 
feeds while increased precipitation has helped both winter wheat 
and the south american soybean crop 
in addition the soviet union a major buyer of us grains has 
been out of the market and is not expected to return at least until 
it has unloaded and distributed boatloads of imported corn that are 
reportedly jamming its ports 
at the close wheat futures were 1 cent to 4 cents lower with 
the contract for delivery in march at 381 a bushel corn was 1 
cents lower to cent higher with march at 238 a bushel oats 
were cent lower to cent higher with march at 137 a bushel 
soybeans were cent to 2 cents lower with march at 558 a bushel

the us economy slowed almost to a standstill 
in the last three months of 1989 registering a barely perceptible 
05 percent annual growth rate that was the poorest since the 
spring of 1986 the government said friday 
the weak growth in the gross national product the countrys 
total output of goods and services raised fears among private 
economists that the record sevenyearlong peacetime expansion was 
in danger of ending especially if jittery financial markets drive 
interest rates higher 
the bush administration was more upbeat however predicting 
that the sluggishness will be followed by an economic rebound 
although vice president dan quayle called the gnp report 
disappointing adding these numbers this morning were not what 
we had hoped for 
the commerce department blamed the big dropoff in growth from 
october through december on a rare decline in consumer spending a 
deteriorating trade deficit and a slump in business investment 
spending 
for the year as a whole the gnp grew by 29 percent following 
a much more rapid 44 percent increase in 1988 it was the slowest 
annual growth rate since a 27 percent rise in 1986 
even with the slower growth inflation was slightly worse during 
the year with a price index tied to the gnp rising by 45 percent 
up from 42 percent in 1988 and the worst showing since 1982 when 
it was 62 percent 
while the fourth quarter gnp advance was in line with 
expectations many economists questioned where the economy will get 
strength for a rebound 
the economy ground to a virtual halt in the fourth quarter 
with signs of weakness everywhere said allen sinai chief 
economist for the boston co my own view is that we are near and 
possibly headed into some sort of a recession 
other economists were not as pessimistic believing that the 
federal reserve would provide another dose of lower interest rates 
if necessary to spur growth 
we are on the bottom edge of the famous soft landing although 
it is somewhat softer than one might have wanted for comfort 
said robert dederick chief economist of the northern trust co 
nevertheless the odds are against a fullfledged recession 
michael boskin chairman of the presidents council of economic 
advisers told reporters at the white house that the credit easing 
engineered by the federal reserve since last june was one of the 
reasons he was optimistic that growth will rebound and the fourth 
quarter weakness will turn out to have only a modest impact on 
the budget deficit 
the administration is basing its 123 trillion budget for 1991 
due to be unveiled monday on a forecast that the gnp will grow 26 
percent this year when measured from the fourth quarter of 1989 to 
the fourth quarter of 1990 
but private analysts even the majority who are not forecasting 
a recession are decidedly less optimistic projecting a lackluster 
gnp increase this year of around 18 percent which would be the 
slowest growth rate since the recession year of 1982 
economists were split on how quickly the economy will regain 
strength michael darby commerce undersecretary for economic 
affairs predicted that gnp growth would rise above 1 percent in 
the current quarter 
he said that a variety of onetime events including the boeing 
strike the san francisco earthquake and hurricane hugo had all 
dampened growth during the last three months of 1989 
but private analysts said recent uneasiness in the stock and 
bond markets could take a toll on economic growth by pushing 
interest rates up to continue to attract foreign investors such a 
development would harm housing and other interestsensitive sectors 
of the economy 
in addition analysts noted that what little strength there was 
in the fourth quarter gnp report came from a substantial 107 
billion rise in unsold business inventories a potential drag on 
future production 
dederick said he expected that gnp growth would remain stuck at 
a weak 05 percent rate in the current quarter as well but that the 
two very weak quarters would be followed by better prospects for 
the rest of the year 
he noted that a separate report friday on orders to factories 
for bigticket durable goods climbed 25 percent in december 
following a 49 percent november gain 
the 05 percent gnp increase was the weakest quarterly showing 
since a decline of 18 percent in the second quarter of 1986 
another period of sluggish activity and one that raised fears at 
the same time the recovery from the 198182 recession was in danger 
of stalling out 
the biggest drag on activity last quarter was a huge swing in 
consumer spending which went from a robust growth rate of 56 
percent in the third quarter to a rare decline of 01 percent in 
the fourth the swing was attributed to car sales which surged in 
the third quarter as consumers responded to sales incentives only 
to slump when the incentives ended 
the trade deficit worsened for the second quarter in a row 
rising by 47 billion as export sales failed to keep up with a 
surge in imports business investment spending fell by 3 percent 
the various changes put the gnp at an annual rate of 4168 
trillion in the fourth quarter

a new employee buyout proposal for ual corp 
holds more promise than a previous employee offer that collapsed in 
october and helped cause a sudden selloff on the stock market 
securities analysts said friday 
if the price is in the 190 a share to 200 range it should 
be a doable deal said louis marckesano an industry analyst for 
janney montgomery scott inc in philadelphia 
if they have a unified proposal among the employees i 
wouldnt really think it would be that difficult he said 
machinists who represent 25000 employees in the parent of 
united airlines opposed the original employee bid on grounds it 
would saddle the company with too much debt but this week they 
said they would join with pilots flight attendants and other 
workers in the new buyout effort 
labor unity and a realistic offer much lower than the 
300ashare 675 billion bid last fall would go a long way in 
reassuring the banks needed to finance the deal another analyst 
said 
the collapse of the previous buyout offer on oct 13 scared many 
investors thought it signaled the end of the corporate takeover 
activity buoying the stock market the dow jones industrial average 
dropped 190 points that day 
if you go back and look at what the concerns were before the 
major concern most of the banks floated was the fact that the 
machinists union was not part of the buyout proposal said the 
airline analyst who spoke on condition of anonymity 
moreover he said at 300 the price was much too high if 
they can make a bid at 200 or less that will go a long way at 
satisfying that concern 
employees still have not agreed on a price for an offer and have 
not yet offered a concrete plan for its financing 
ual has been mired in efforts to define its future since last 
august when los angeles billionaire marvin davis made an 
unsolicited offer of 200 a share or 432 billion for one of the 
nations largest airlines 
this week ual encouraged employees to work up a formal buyout 
proposal but still kept other options open releasing davis from 
prior agreements prohibiting him from making an offer for less than 
300 a share some analysts doubted however that other bidders 
would resurface 
marckesano said one key issue yet to be resolved is the role 
current chairman stephen wolf would play in an employeecontrolled 
ual 
the big question is mr wolf he said im a wolf fan i 
think whatever course ual takes in the future theyd be better off 
with him steering the ship 
but the analyst who asked not to be named said machinists had 
long resented wolf the analyst speculated they joined the buyout 
bid only after receiving reassurances wolf would not be part of the 
deal 
a ual spokesman refused to comment on wolf and a spokesman for 
the machinists union did not immediately return telephone calls 
seeking comment 
the takeover wrangling thats afflicted ual has come against a 
background of uncertainty in the airline industry caused by higher 
fuel prices and signs of a broader economic downturn 
on thursday ual reported earnings of 68 million or 31 cents 
a share for the three months ended dec 31 drastically lower than 
the 209 million or 97 cents a share for the same period of 1988 
quarterly revenues totaled 24 billion up from 22 billion in 
1988 
ual said fourthquarter expenses of 60 million related to the 
failed buyout bid were partly offset by a 407 million gain from 
stock appreciation rights that were also linked to the buyout 
attempt those items combined depressed fourth quarter earnings by 
116 million 
a 34 percent increase in jet fuel expenses also depressed 
earnings ual said

news friday that economic growth slowed to a 
crawl in the last quarter capped two weeks in which major us 
companies announced more than 15000 layoffs 
the upshot according to many economists is that employment is 
sluggish particularly in manufacturing and more layoffs may be in 
the offing 
the gross national product figures released friday suggest the 
economy needs to cut production somewhat said susan lakatos an 
economist for kidder peabody amp co in general the economy is 
slowing 
the government report showed the economy grew by just 05 
percent in the final three months of 1989 the poorest performance 
since the spring of 1986 
i think youll end up with a broad pattern of increasing 
layoffs added richard b hoey chief economist at drexel burnham 
lambert inc 
in the past two weeks 
general electric co said it would eliminate about 5700 
aerospace jobs as it prepares for reduced pentagon spending 
boeing co said it would pare up to 5000 jobs also due in 
part to anticipated defense cutbacks 
grumman corp another defense contractor said it would lay 
off 300 workers and eliminate 700 more jobs by years end for the 
same reason 
caterpillar inc the heavyequipment maker said it would lay 
off 1200 workers 
merrill lynch amp co said it would lay off more than 3000 
workers as the investment house continues to reel from wall 
streets twoyear slump 
going back to the beginning of the year more than 45000 
autoworkers have been notified of indefinite or temporary layoffs 
at plants around the country 
what were seeing right now is looking dramatic because its 
big companies and big numbers ms lakatos said 
whats harder to see but even more important is that 
companies of all sizes are not hiring as many new workers due to a 
slowdown in expansion she said 
the economys manufacturing sector showed steady growth in 
employment until last summer when it stopped in its tracks ms 
lakatos said about 20 percent of all us workers are employed in 
manufacturing 
on friday the government also reported that orders to factories 
for durable goods increased 25 percent in december but that 
almost all the gain came in orders for aircraft ships and tanks 
excluding these categories factory orders would have been flat 
hoey said the companies making cutbacks in their defense 
businesses are taking prudent action because they realize the 
defense buildup of the 1980s is ending 
he believes layoffs will spread from the defense and auto 
industries to other areas of the economy this year 
what youre seeing is the early signs of what ultimately will 
prove to be a recession he said giving a minority opinion among 
wall street economists 
john hagens an economist at the forecasting firm wefa group is 
not as pessimistic 
our view is there will be more layoffs coming and the 
unemployment rate will rise but not like in a recession he said 
but he added job growth overall this year will be 
substantially less than weve had in the last seven eight years 
during the 1982 recession for example unemployment jumped to 
about 11 percent from 57 percent in 1979 
in contrast hagens firm forecasts the jobless rate will rise 
by onehalf to one percentage point this year 
you really can become overly pessimistic about job prospects 
and employment growth by focusing on bigcompany layoffs he 
said job growth continues in many service industries such as 
health and education he said 
however he added when we have very sluggish growth in the 
economy and profits extremely weak in 1989 and unlikely to rebound 
in 1990 there will be a shedding of other jobs

the stock market remained on the defensive today 
as traders studied the latest data on the state of the economy 
the commerce department reported that the gross national product 
grew at a 05 percent annual rate after adjustment for inflation 
in the fourth quarter of last year 
the figure was a bit stronger than some analysts had projected 
but observers noted that it was magnified to a great extent by 
increases in inventories which is usually interpreted as evidence 
of weakness in business activity 
a separate report showed a 25 percent rise in new factory 
orders for durable goods in december 
in the bond market where traders are especially sensitive to 
even slight changes in the perceived pace of the economy interest 
rates rose after the figures crossed financial news wires

revco ds inc the first big company to seek 
bankruptcycourt refuge from debts incurred in a leveraged buyout 
announced plans friday to sell 712 of its 1873 stores in a costly 
restructuring 
the company one of the countrys largest drugstore chains with 
a work force of 26800 people said it would refocus on operations 
in eastern states where sales are strongest 
the strategic advantages of restructuring operations have 
become increasingly clear over time said gregory k raven chief 
financial officer for the company based in twinsburg ohio a 
cleveland suburb internal and external analyses agree this is 
whats best for revco 
its announcement to shrink by more than a third came against a 
background of growing alarm about the consequences of the 1980s 
debtfinanced takeover tactic known as the leveraged buyout or lbo 
earlier this month torontobased campeau corp owner of many 
famous us department stores sought chapter 11 protection because 
it couldnt make payments on the multibilliondollar debts incurred 
to buy the stores over the last three years 
revcos drugstores will now join many of campeaus department 
stores on the auction block 
revco filed for chapter 11 protection from creditors back in 
july 1988 about a month after it failed to make an interest 
payment on about 700 million in outstanding highrisk junk bonds 
used to finance its 15 billion managementled lbo in 1986 
it was the first major lbo to seek the sanctuary of bankruptcy 
court to untangle its finances 
to cover the cost of the restructuring announced friday revco 
said it would take a record 230 million charge against earnings in 
its third fiscal quarter which will end feb 10 
the company intends to open discussions with potential buyers 
for 712 of its drugstores any sales are subject to bankruptcy 
court approval 
boake a sells chairman and chief executive officer of revco 
said he believed the majority of companys employees will keep 
their jobs the company hopes that those working in stores now 
targeted for sale would be hired by eventual buyers he said 
harrison jones manager of the revco store in downtown magnolia 
ark said he was concerned but not surprised at the news arkansas 
is one of the states where stores are targeted for divestiture 
actually i feel good about it like maybe someone in this 
general area will purchase this thing and it will be solid 
financially and theyll take it and run with it jones said 
generally employees at the store arent surprised theyre a 
little disappointed because on the surface it generally means bad 
news he said 
in october it was reported that revco was considering a 925 
million buyout bid from a texasbased group of investors that 
included billionaire robert bass well known for his takeover 
forays 
it was unclear friday whether these investors played any role in 
revcos divestment plans revco spokeswoman kathleen obert declined 
to identify any possible store buyers 
sells said it was too early to estimate how long it would take 
to complete the restructuring 
sales from the stores to be divested represent about 36 percent 
of the chains total sales the company said 
revco plans to concentrate and build on markets in georgia 
maryland new york north carolina ohio pennsylvania south 
carolina eastern tennessee virginia and west virginia 
locations targeted for divestiture include 712 revco drugstores 
currently operating alabama arizona arkansas colorado florida 
illinois indiana iowa kansas kentucky louisiana michigan 
mississippi missouri new mexico oklahoma western tennessee and

the dollar finished mixed friday weakening 
against the british pound and japanese yen but rising against other 
currencies in heavy trading 
gold prices rose on the new york commodity exchange a troy 
ounce of gold gained 410 a troy ounce to close at 42010 
republic national bank later quoted a bid of 420 a troy ounce up 
3 from thursday 
most of the days activity centered on the yen which investors 
continued to buy aggressively analysts noted that optimism about 
the future of japans governing liberal democratic party ahead of 
next months elections spurred interest in the currency 
but the dollar suffered as investors sold the us currency to 
buy yen there are fears that foreigners are withdrawing from 
us markets said marc chandler an analyst at mms international 
in chicago 
he said traders are edgy ahead of the upcoming quarterly 
refunding the treasury department is expected to announce next 
week its schedule for the sale of an estimated 30 billion in 
bonds the proceeds of which are used to keep the government 
running 
foreigners who have been attracted by relatively high interest 
rates here need dollars to buy us debt securities but chandler 
noted that rising interest rates abroad especially in japan 
have incited fears that foreigners will shun the bonds 
the dollar got somewhat of a boost from a government report that 
showed the gross national product posted a 05 percent annual 
growth rate in the final quarter of 1989 although the figure 
which represents the countrys total output of goods and services 
was the poorest showing since the spring of 1986 it was better 
than the market had expected and therefore bolstered the dollar 
initially 
the market had already priced in the number said stephen 
flanagan a vice president at manufacturers hanover trust co 
shortly after the figure was released trading turned again to the 
yen 
in tokyo the dollar closed at 14397 yen down from 14530 yen

new york the dollar closed lower still at 14280 yen compared

hawaii is making a major push toward becoming a 
world financial center attempting to remold itself as something 
more than an exotic pacific vacation spot 
efforts are underway by the states political and business 
community to lure large brokerage houses and create one or more 
exchanges that would trade stocks commodities currencies options 
and other products 
at stake for hawaii is the chance to position itself as a leader 
of the pacific rim and an opportunity to diversify its 
touristdriven economy 
we have to convince the business community both here and 
elsewhere that hawaii is more than a place to vacation said bill 
cook of the state department of economic development 
since the effort to create a honolulu stock exchange began in 
1987 talks have taken place with several exchanges including the 
new york mercantile exchange pacific stock exchange and exchanges 
in chicago and asia 
no deals have been reached and negotiations are continuing the 
talks are centered on how much assistance and incentives the state 
will provide the exchanges largely in the form of tax breaks 
important to hawaiis exchange bid is that it would fill in the 
fourhour time gap between the closing of the new york stock 
exchange and the opening of the tokyo stock exchange allowing for 
trading on almost a 24houraday basis 
what we make it easier for american exchanges to do is trade 
with asia on asian time said galen fox executive assistant for 
honolulu mayor frank fasi if you want to expand business with 
asia which is in some ways the financial center of the world 
already then you should be catering to their markets and 
interests rather than asking them to get up early in the morning 
or at midnight to trade with your markets 
its a breakthrough in thinking in terms of how important it 
is to reach asia fox said the breakthrough occurs in part 
because you can do it in honolulu 
another asset is hawaiis population base which includes a 
sizable mainland and asian population its this diverse cultural 
foundation that may convince brokerage firms on both sides of the 
pacific to set up shop here 
you have a number of people here that are very knowledgeable 
about both us and japanese markets said david bess dean of 
the university of hawaii school of business administration i 
think a knowledge base exists here that few other cities would 
have 
a honolulu exchange would allow asian brokers to trade in 
products not offered in their markets and would add to the volume 
of their newborn options trading which started in 1989 also all 
trades would be regulated by us securities laws a sales point 
being used to placate wary mainland firms 
fred sexton president of the economic development corp of 
honolulu and the man leading the exchange effort said his biggest 
challenge is alleviating the skittishness of american brokerage 
houses 
the number one obstacle is fear among american companies he 
said its not been done here and they dont know whether they 
can generate enough volume to make it successful the only way 
theyre going to find out is to do it 
diversification of hawaiis economy is a major goal of the 
1990s as state and business leaders realize the need to generate 
more professional jobs to keep the states young people from 
leaving 
tourism accounted for 39 percent of the states 20 billion in 
revenues in 1988 the most recent figures available from the state 
officials feel a honolulu financial center would create hundreds 
of highpaying professional jobs as well as bring a number of 
hightechnology firms and related financial service companies to 
hawaii 
the whole range of industries that will come in connection 
with the emergence of a honolulu financial center will be 
helpful fox said related industries like backroom financing 
and informationrelated industries these are kind of secondary 
benefits from having a financial center grow here 
because of the high costs of setting up an equities trading 
floor its likely other products like currencies and options would 
set up trading floors first with stock trading beginning after the 
foundation is laid 
what i see as a possibility is the trading of currencies 
futures and options said randy havre a broker with jd havre 
and associates its less costly and more practical than trading 
equities so if and when trading equities would be feasible it 
would have a base to build on 
gov john waihee said while hawaii stands to benefit from a 
financial center it wont come about unless the brokerage houses 
have something to gain 
theres no use coming out to hawaii and essentially processing 
the same number of trades as you would in new york the governor 
said from hawaii you can get into an entirely new market and an 
exchange can stand on its own 
the bottom line is going to be whether or not coming to hawaii 
results in the creation of new markets waihee said if it 
does than the advantage of coming here increases you can almost 
do this anywhere why not do it in paradise

gasoline futures prices rose sharply friday on the new york 
mercantile exchange showing surprising resilience to bearish 
fundamentals and leading the entire group of energy commodities to 
a higher close 
on other commodity markets pork belly futures fella while 
livestock futures were mixed precious metals advanced and grains 
and soybeans were mostly lower 
the contract for february delivery of wholesale unleaded 
gasoline surged 152 cents to 6212 cents a gallon other contracts 
settled 55 cent to 97 cents higher 
west texas intermediate crude oil finished 25 cents to 32 cents 
higher with march at 2256 a barrel heating oil was 17 cent 
lower to 28 cent higher with february at 5960 cents a gallon 
much of gasolines strength apparently stemmed from fears of 
tight supplies for delivery against the february gasoline contract 
which expires wednesday 
concerns about such a supply squeeze surface frequently in the 
energy market but usually prove unfounded 
the rally defied a bevy of negative signals including tuesdays 
weekly american petroleum institute report of a large increase in 
us gasoline supplies and the resolution wednesday of an 
eightday strike by brazilian oilworkers 
in addition a savage storm that ripped through britain on 
thursday had little effect on the north sea petroleum industry 
fears of stormrelated disruptions to pumping and refining 
operations had contributed to a runup in crude oil values on 
thursday 
the market is remarkably strong despite having a couple of 
things thrown at it over past couple days said analyst peter 
beutel of elders futures inc in new york 
porkbelly futures fell sharply on the chicago mercantile 
exchange ending a week of rollercoaster moves in the thinly 
traded market 
the contracts for february march and may deliveries fell the 
permitted daily limit of 2 cents a pound after rising more than 1 
cent on thursday and falling nearly the limit on both monday and 
wednesday 
the losses early in the week reflected expectations that 
wednesdays monthly agriculture department coldstorage report 
would show an increase in supplies of frozen pork bellies 
but the report indicated supplies were much smaller than 
expected prompting thursdays strong advance 
fridays tumble reflected weaker cash markets for both bellies 
and hogs said thomas morgan president of sterling research corp 
in arlington heights ill 
frozen pork bellies were 98 cent to 2 cents lower with february 
at 5410 cents a pound live cattle settled 23 cent lower to 12 
cent higher with february at 7927 cents a pound feeder cattle 
were 13 cent lower to 10 cent higher with march at 8342 cents a 
pound live hogs were 48 cent lower to 13 cent higher with 
february at 4925 cents a pound 
gold futures climbed strongly on new yorks commodity exchange 
amid stockmarket jitters the dow jones industrials average ended 
nearly unchanged after seesawing widely during the session 
gold futures ended 410 to 430 higher with february at 
42030 a troy ounce silver was 1 cent to 13 cents higher with 
march at 526 a troy ounce 
most grain and soybean futures fell on the chicago board of 
trade on concerns about slack export sales of us grain 
wheat futures also were pressured by improved growing conditions 
in the us winter wheat belt where recent rains and snowfall have 
helped to relieve extreme dryness 
wheat futures settled 1 cent to 4 cents lower with march at 
381 a bushel corn was 1 cent lower to cent higher with march 
at 238 a bushel oats were cent lower to cent higher with 
march at 137 a bushel soybeans were 2 cents lower to cent 
higher with march at 558 a bushel

bond prices slipped friday as the market reacted 
to government figures that showed the economy was not slowing as 
much as some had assumed 
the treasurys benchmark 30year bond which has lost about 1 
points over the past three sessions dropped 1932 point or about 
594 for every 1000 face amount 
its yield which rises when prices fall edged up to 851 
percent from 846 percent late thursday 
the government released a pair of economic reports friday saying 
the economy grew at a 05 percent pace in the final three months of 
1989 and that orders to factories for durable goods rose 25 
percent in december 
analysts said the gross national product figures matched 
expectations but many of them had been looking for a decline in 
durable goods orders 
luke haney a bond trader with the philadelphia brokerage 
butcher amp singer inc said the economic news kind of puts your 
investors on the sidelines wondering exactly what is going on 
weve just been in a tremendous downflow and there dont seem 
to be any buyers out there he added 
william griggs a partner in the investment firm griggs amp santow 
inc said the reports disappointed traders who were looking for 
signs of economic deterioration clear enough that the federal 
reserve would be compelled to encourage lower interest rates a 
move that would boost bond prices 
there was nothing in these numbers that will suggest the fed 
will ease policy right away griggs said 
in the secondary market for treasury bonds prices of shortterm 
governments were down by 116 point to 316 point intermediate 
maturities were off lsqb point to 516 point and longterm issues 
lost as much as 1116 point according to telerate inc the 
financial information service 
the movement of a point is equivalent to a change of 10 in the 
price of a bond with a 1000 face value 
the shearson lehman hutton daily treasury bond index which 
measures price movements on all outstanding treasury issues with 
maturities of a year or longer was down 331 at 115963 
in the taxexempt market the bond buyer index of 40 actively 
traded municipal bonds fell 1132 point to 91 1132 the average 
yield to maturity rose to 744 from 741 percent late thursday 
yields on threemonth treasury bills fell to 791 percent as the 
discount fell 1 basis point to 767 percent yields on sixmonth 
bills rose to 802 percent as the discount rose 1 basis point to 
762 percent yields on oneyear bills fell marginally to 803 
percent as the discount remained unchanged at 749 percent 
a basis point is onehundredth of a percentage point the yield 
is the annualized return on an investment in a treasury bill the 
discount is the percentage that bills are selling below the face 
value which is paid at maturity 
the federal funds rate the interest rate banks charge each 
other on overnight loans was quoted at 8 1316 percent up from 8 
316 percent late thursday

continental airlines said friday it had 
dismissed nw ayer as its advertising agency ending an 
association that began in 1986 
the houstonbased carrier a unit of texas air corp notified 
the agency late thursday that it was placing its advertising 
assignment up for review the agency said 
ayer is no longer continentals agency as of today 
continental spokesman art kent confirmed by telephone from houston 
we just felt it was time for a change 
he said he could not elaborate and did not know what steps were 
being taken to get another agency 
ayer had been using the theme working to be your choice in 
continentals advertising recent ads touting service to 
warmweather destinations used the line weve got your place in 
the sun 
continental planned to spend an estimated 35 million to 40 
million on its advertising this year executives familiar with the 
account said kent said he did not know the actual figure 
ayer a privatelyheld agency based in new york handles 13 
billion in advertising billings worldwide and counts among its 
clients american telephone amp telegraph co procter amp gamble co 
and general motors corp 
the decision came as a surprise to ayer executives said vice 
chairman thomas f maxey we had no indication this was coming 
he said 
ayer opened an office in houston after it was awarded the 
account in 1986 and the office currently employs about 30 people 
ten to 15 more employees work on the continental account in new 
york 
maxey said it was likely that the houston office would be closed 
after an orderly transition ayer expects to continue servicing the 
account for up to 90 days in addition to the continental account 
the houston office handles only a few small public service 
assignments at no charge 
john walsh an executive vice president who oversees the 
continental account said he understood that continentals business 
was improving although the industry has been troubled by declining 
traffic and rising fuel costs 
they said they felt they needed a change in our estimation of 
the situation the situation was good and our work was good he 
said 
kent confirmed continentals business was improving he said the 
airline earned 591 million for the first nine months of 1989 in 
contrast to a loss of 2159 million a year earlier 
texas air also owns eastern airlines which has been operating 
since march under protection of federal bankruptcy laws and has 
been losing millions of dollars 
airline accounts are particularly laborintensive industry 
executives say because of frequent price changes within the 
industry and the need to develop different print ads for each 
market 
but maxey said ayer would be interested in going after another 
airline account anyway he said the agency handles advertising 
assignments for iberia airlines air france and scandanavian 
airline system 
he said the agency is one of the finalists for four different 
advertising assignments which he declined to identify 
in 1989 ayer was fired by burger king corp after working as 
its ad agency for 18 months and producing the campaign we do it 
like youd do it the fastfood chain was spending 150 million a 
year on its advertising then 
among ayers recent notable ads have been its commercials for 
atampt longdistance service that featured people near the berlin 
wall and a commercial for phillips milk of magnesia that used a 
roll of toilet paper to illustrate the powers of the laxative

increases in inventories which is usually interpreted as evidence 
of weakness in business activity

mcdonnell douglas corp on friday reported a 58 
percent decline in fourthquarter profits as major writeoffs in 
several divisions plagued the nations largest defense contractor 
for the threemonth period ending dec 31 the company had 
profits of 60 million or 156 a share compared with 145 
million or 379 a share for the same period a year earlier 
revenue for the quarter totaled 429 billion up slightly from

writeoffs in the quarter 91 million for its ah64 apache 
helicopter 22 million for its t45 aircraft training system and 
14 million in its missiles space and electronic systems segment 
companies take writeoffs when they have to reduce the value of 
an asset mcdonnell douglas attributed its reductions to higher 
cost estimates that lowered earnings rates

three quarters of the year that contributed to a 37 percent decline 
in annual profits 
for the year the company reported profits of 219 million down 
from 350 million for the same period a year ago revenue increased 
to 146 billion from 144 billion in 1988

schedule

neil bush said friday that his father the 
president told him to do whats right when the younger bush 
said he intends to fight conflictofinterest charges leveled by 
federal thrift regulators 
the decision may put the president in the awkward position of 
appointing the official likely to decide the case but neil bush 
said after talking to his father earlier in the day that he did not 
believe the matter would pose a problem 
hes giving me the same advice he has given me for 35 years 
do whats right and im doing whats right the presidents son 
told a news conference in denver 
i will fight and although i know that taking on the feds 
is tough i intend to win 
the office of thrift supervision said friday it will issue a 
notice of charges alleging that actions by the younger bush as 
a director of a colorado savings and loan amounted to conflicts 
of interest 
the announcement came after the presidents son refused to 
voluntarily accept an order from regulators directing him to 
refrain from actions amounting to a conflict of interest if in the 
future he becomes an officer of a savings and loan a bank or a 
credit union 
i believe in the principle that if you havent done anything 
wrong dont do anything that might be an admission of 
wrongdoing neil bush said 
he was a director of the failed silverado banking savings and 
loan association in denver from 1985 until august 1988 resigning 
two weeks before his father accepted the gop presidential 
nomination 
according to karl hoyle senior deputy director of the thrift 
office the younger bushs stance triggers an administrative 
process that typically lasts a year and could stretch to as long as 
two years if initial rulings are appealed 
hoyle said the thrift office will ask an administrative law 
judge to hold a hearing on the notice of charges and recommend to 
thrift office director m danny wall that a ceaseanddesist order 
be issued against the presidents son 
but wall a reagan administration appointee who announced his 
resignation last month almost certainly will have left the agency 
by then passing on the case to a new thrift office director who 
must be nominated by the president and confirmed by the senate 
white house spokeswoman alixe glen said the presidents 
decision on a nominee for the thrift office will be made completely 
independently of this or any other case 
the december 1988 collapse of silverado now operating as part 
of columbia savings the largest thrift in colorado is expected to 
cost taxpayers up to 1 billion 
hoyle said the agency expected to make public the specific 
charges against neil bush after they are filed the agency has 
focused its investigation of silverado on what it said was an 
exceptionally large number of problem transactions between 
silverado insiders and borrowers 
the younger bush was a partner in an oil exploration firm jnb 
exploration with two of silverados major borrowers developers 
bill l walters and ken good in a statement thursday however 
bush said there was nothing improper with the connection 
bill walters had a passive 625 percent limited partnership 
interest in jnb exploration the presidents son said because 
i did not benefit directly or indirectly from any loan or 
transaction between silverado and businesses controlled by bill 
walters as an outside director i voted in 1986 with the other 
directors in unanimously approving the walters loans and 
transactions brought to us by management 
good according to neil bush had a more active interest in the 
financing and management of jnb exploration and as a result i 
abstained on all votes concerning good 
earlier this month the thrift office announced that five 
officers of silverado had accepted orders banning them for life 
from working for a federally insured financial institution without 
permission from regulators 
hoyle said the agency does not believe it has the grounds to 
seek that more severe penalty against the presidents son 
he noted that any thrift office action does not preclude a civil 
suit by the federal deposit insurance corp seeking damages from 
silverados officers and directors in compensation for taxpayer 
losses incurred in the bailout nor does it preclude any criminal 
charges if evidence indicates they are warranted 
the administrative ceaseanddesist order being pursued against 
neil bush would enable the thrift office to seek fines up to 1 
million a day for future violations according to rosemary stewart 
thrift office enforcement director 
out of the whole arsenal this is the mildest form of 
enforcement said warren l dennis a washington attorney 
specializing in sampl law its not even a stun gun or a rubber 
bullet 
dennis said both neil bush and the government are in a difficult 
position 
the government is pursuing these types of orders even for 
passive directors and they feel they cannot make an exception for 
the presidents son who is in the position of many of these 
directors of not wanting to accept even a pro forma slap on the 
wrist because they feel theyve done nothing wrong he said

atampt bell laboratories plans to announce 
the development of a computer that runs on photons instead of 
electrons creating the potential for vastly more powerful 
computers an official said friday 
the company has set a news conference for monday but refused to 
comment on its subject matter 
but an industry official familiar with the research who spoke 
on condition of anonymity confirmed the conference would be about 
the creation of a photonic computer 
such a computer would transmit information with photons the 
fundamental particles of light rather than electronic impulses 
the prototype to be unveiled monday is a fairly rudimentary 
device that runs at a low level of power but is believed to be the 
first to run on photons the official said 
scientists believe such computers some day may run at speeds 
thousands of times faster than todays versions

former grabill corp chairman william stoecker 
was acquitted friday on six counts of bankruptcy fraud in 
connection with the collapse of his financial empire 
a us district court jury deliberated for six hours before 
returning the notguilty verdicts for stoecker 32 who was charged 
with failing to disclose 255000 to the bankruptcy trustee 
appointed to oversee his estate 
until his troubles surfaced last year stoecker had a reputation 
as a financial genius who had built a multimilliondollar 
conglomerate of 22 manufacturing and retail companies all acquired 
in leveraged buyouts 
but his financial empire began to crumble in december 1988 when 
he was unable to make full payment on a 150 million loan 
a ninebank consortium that loaned stoecker the money forced the 
conglomerate into bankruptcy in early 1989 after finding that 100 
million in assets had disappeared stoecker also went into personal 
bankruptcy 
he was charged last april with bankruptcy fraud prosecutors 
said he concealed assets to maintain a lavish lifestyle that 
include mansions airplanes and expensive art 
the government alleged stoecker contributed 140000 to a bank 
account he created in his maids name they also said he hid 
another 115000 in a safe in his suburban home 
but during the weeklong trial durkin contended that government 
witnesses lied and that attorneys who testified against stoecker 
were trying to protect legal fees exceeding 1 million from the 
bankruptcy proceedings 
some of stoeckers friends and relatives in the courtroom burst 
into tears when the verdicts were read afterward stoecker said he 
felt oustanding

rjr nabisco incs junk bonds previously a 
stalwart in the volatile highyield debt market fell sharply 
friday after moodys investors service inc lowered its rating of 
the companys debt 
analysts said some of rjr nabiscos junk bonds fell 10 percent 
in value the rest of the highyield market also declined but not 
as severely 
moodys lowered its ratings on rjr nabiscos outstanding debt 
and assigned a lowerthanexpected rating to an upcoming 125 
billion bond issue the company plans 
jim lewis a corporate bond trader with prudentialbache 
securities inc said rjr nabiscos bonds which helped finance 
the record 2453 billion leveraged buyout of food and tobacco 
company were hurt by the downgrade but also have fallen this 
week in response to volatility in the stock market 
fridays decline reversed a trend in highyield trading rjr 
nabiscos bonds fared better than other issues recently when the 
junk bond market plunged in response to the failure of campeau 
corps buyout of federated department stores inc 
the rjr nabisco bonds dont look as good as they used to 
lewis said 
the bonds declined although rjr nabisco securities received 
somewhat more favorable ratings from two other companies standard 
amp poors corp and fitch investors service inc 
lewis said the moodys rating meant that the purchasers of the 
new 125 billion issue likely would have to be the same investors 
who were willing to take a risk on the earlier 4 billion in bonds 
traders had hoped to see a bigger market for the new bonds he said 
the perception is now youve shifted the major buying 
responsibility to the junkier section of the market he said 
rjr nabisco said months ago it planned the new issue to 
refinance some of its debt after completing 54 billion in asset 
sales required under its loan agreements with major banks 
moodys said uncertainties about the cash flow of rjr nabiscos 
tobacco business over the longterm led it to lower its ratings 
although moodys analyst gloria vila said we recognize that 
certain nearterm risks have been alleviated 
she credited rjr nabisco for successfully completing its asset 
divestiture program and selecting a good management team but she 
said the firm like other tobacco companies faces the problem of 
fewer smokers and possibly lower profits in the years ahead 
furthermore she said rjr nabisco has had more success with some 
of its lowerpriced brands such as doral cigarettes than with 
highermargin products such as winston 
rjr nabisco spokesman david kalis said the company could not 
comment on moodys action because the firm was required to remain 
silent while the 125 billion in bonds were awaiting approval from 
the securities and exchange commission 
standard amp poors said it had completed a review of rjr nabisco 
and had affirmed its rating of the companys debt william 
wetreich a standard amp poors spokesman said his firm had no plans 
to further review rjr nabiscos rating 
standard amp poors noted concerns about the tobacco business but 
the companys strong tobacco cash flows are still expected to 
continue growing 
the rating service also gave the new bond issue a speculative 
grade 
fitch assigned the new issue its highest rating for speculative 
or highyield debt this was the first rating fitch has made of 
rjr nabisco bonds the company only recently began evaluating the 
highyield market

utah chemical magnate jon huntsman and a 
general electric co division said friday they are attempting to 
form a 5050 joint venture that could acquire aristech chemical 
corp for more than 899 million 
huntsman holdings corp and ge plastics of pittsfield mass 
said the proposal could enable huntsman to boost his offer for 
aristech from 25 a share to at least 26 a share according to a 
letter the salt lake city businessman mailed to aristech board 
member rs evans 
aristech spokesman david higie declined to comment friday 
huntsman is in a bidding war for aristech with mitsubishi corp 
of japan and aristechs senior management which last week offered 
26 a share the senior management group is led by aristech 
chairman thomas marshall 
aristech has about 32 million outstanding shares or the 
equivalent of about 346 million fully diluted outstanding shares 
aristech stock dropped 12 cents friday in new york stock exchange 
trading to 2512 
huntsmans 25ashare offer worth about 865 million was 
rejected in november 
aristechs board in effect rejected the mitsubishimanagement 
bid on wednesday when it announced it would seek bids from buyers 
willing to pay more than 26 a share the board set a bidding 
deadline for 5 pm monday 
in his letter huntsman asked aristech to extend the deadline 
until feb 20 to give him more time to review aristechs financial 
condition and form the joint venture 
unfortunately the 5 pm jan 29 deadline for the submission 
of bids as set forth in your jan 24 letter to me will not afford 
us an adequate opportunity to conduct the necessary review 
huntsman wrote 
in view of mitsubishi corps and aristech managements 
lengthy period to conduct a complete review of aristech fairness 
dictates that we be afforded a reasonable due diligence review 
period the letter said 
huntsman has signed an agreement not to accumulate additional 
aristech stock unless he offers to buy all outstanding stock for 
25 per share or more huntsman currently owns 87 percent of the 
companys stock according to huntsman spokesman joele frank 
in securities and exchange commission documents filed thursday 
huntsman said he has signed a confidentiality agreement in return 
for receiving confidential financial data about the company 
much of aristechs holdings are former usx chemical corp

streep has been filmed for a commercial that is expected to be 
aired later in the year according to spokeswoman gail wasserman of 
american express travelrelated services co inc wasserman 
declined to say how much the actors had been paid for their 
appearances 
the commercials are being billed as video portraits and are 
the first video takeoffs on the highlyacclaimed series of print 
ads that american express has done in recent years featuring 
distinctive photographs of wellknown people who have been longtime 
cardholders 
former house speaker thomas p tip oneill for instance 
was shown seated under a beach umbrella playing cards in hand in 
one ad 
in another print ad former basketball star wilt chamberlain and 
jockey willie shoemaker were photographed together each dressed in 
white suits actress candice bergen was in another ad riding a 
horse 
the use of famous stars on tv represents a notable departure for 
american express until a few years ago the company was best known 
for its longrunning campaign featuring obscure faces introducing 
themselves by saying do you know me 
newman doesnt say a word in his 60second commercial which 
will be run during the fourth quarter of the super bowl broadcast 
the ad opens with newman a racing car enthusiast and cardmember 
since 1966 zipping up his leather jacket pulling on some racing 
gloves and heading for the track 
he is handed a miniature motorcyle and it soon becomes evident 
that he is expected to ride it in a race against a highpowered car

rorer group inc which last week 
announced plans to merge with a french pharmaceutical firm said 
thursday its earnings rose 66 percent in the fourth quarter and 40 
percent in 1989 in part because of a fee for terminating an 
earlier merger pact with another drug company 
net income jumped to 447 million or 138 a share in the 
fourth quarter from 269 million or 85 cents a share a year 
earlier sales grew 24 percent to 403 million from 325 million 
for all of 1989 the suburban philadelphia company reported net 
income rose to 865 million or 267 a share from 618 million 
or 196 a share in 1988 sales increased 13 percent to 118 
billion from 104 billion 
the 1989 earnings include a pretax gain of 199 million that 
reflected a fee paid by ah robins co inc in the fourth quarter 
for breaking off a merger agreement with rorer in favor of one with 
american home products corp 
on jan 18 rorer announced it agreed to merge with the drug 
operations of rhonepoulenc the 3 billion deal would give the 
french company 68 percent of rorers stock leaving the rest in 
public hands the resulting firm would be one of the worlds 10 
largest pharmaceutical companies 
the gain was partially offset by almost 10 million in 
restructuring costs for rorers european facilities 
it was an exceptionally good year for us around the world 
said rorers chairman and chief executive officer robert e 
cawthorn we achieved strong results even though we invested 
heavily in marketing programs and research and development to 
ensure a prosperous future 
cawthorn said results benefited from a 46 percent increase in 
sales of rorers calcitonin drugs used to treat the degenerative 
bone disease osteoporosis 
sales of maalox antacid the companys bestknown product grew 
19 percent in the fourth quarter compared with a year earlier he

the nevada gaming commission on 
thursday gave final approval to a restructuring of holiday corp 
clearing the way for the hotel and gaming company to sell its 
holiday inn chain to bass plc of britain 
under the restructuring holiday corp will retain three other 
fastgrowing hotel chains and its harrahs casinos in nevada and 
new jersey and operate under the new name of promus companies inc 
the gaming operations will account for 80 percent of promus 
revenues with the embassy suites homewood suites and hampton inns 
chains making up the remainder 
holiday corp had agreed to sell holiday inn to bass for about 
22 billion pending regulatory approval shareholders endorsed the 
plan jan 17 and nevadas gaming control board and new jerseys 
casino control commission gave their approval previously 
promus will have a more concentrated commitment to the gaming 
industry and increased financial strength commission

its not only in the best interests of the shareholders but in the 
best interests of the gaming industry of nevada 
holiday corp officials said the firm decided to sell its 
interest in more than 1400 holiday inn hotels because they were 
competing for capital against its casinos and other hotels 
harrahs president phil satre said the company is committed to 
its casinos in nevada and new jersey and the restructuring would 
allow it to continue with capital improvements at each in the 
future 
we are proud of a record of success in gaming in nevada and

are confident we can do it in the form of the promus companies 
commission members approved the plan after holiday officials 
said their legal and accounting experts assured them the 
transaction would be taxfree holiday officials said they didnt 
want to wait for an internal revenue service ruling because it
