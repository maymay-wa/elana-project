a new centerleft government headed by 
former prime minister steingrimur hermannsson took office 
wednesday enacting an immediate pricewage freeze and devaluating 
the icelandic krona 
the government in a statement issued immediately after assuming 
power announced a 3 percent devaluation of the krona a wage 
freeze until midfebruary and a price freeze until the end of 
february in a bid to stave off icelands acute economic problems 
thorsteinn palssons 15month centerright coalition government 
resigned last week after failing to agree on economic policy 
hermannssons ninemember cabinet groups his centrist 
progressive party the social democratic party and the leftist 
peoples alliance it was sworn in by president vigdis 
finnbogadottir following negotiations among the political parties 
without an election being called 
hermannsson said his governments top goal was to bring down the 
annual rate of inflation from its present level of 25 percent to 
around five percent by the middle of next year 
the fishing industry accounting for twothirds of this north 
atlantic island nations foreign exchange earnings has been 
especially hardhit by the crisis and is reported near bankruptcy 
the fishing industry has demanded a sharp devaluation of the 
krona to cut the price of its exports making them more 
competitive but a currency devaluation automatically pushes up the 
price of imports from abroad 
one us dollar was worth 4676 kronur immediately before 
wednesdays devaluation the third this year 
hermannsson was foreign minister in palssons government which 
took office in june 1987

identified as clifford mayard paul and jean marie gouffe at the ido 
lele a luxury hotel on the heights of petionville overlooking

guns grenades and grenade launchers the radio said 
opposition leader louie dejoie jr head of the national 
industrial and agricultural party and a member of the committee for 
democratic understanding told the associated press late wednesday 
it seems that the government is doing its job which is to disarm 
the macoutes 
it was a reference to the dread tonton macoutes the private 
militia during the 29year duvalier dynasty that suppressed all 
opposition 
the arrests were made in line with a communique issued tuesday 
night by the minister of defense and interior col carl 
dorfainvil calling on the people to hand in any unregistered 
weapon to the nearest military authority 
wednesdays developments prompted leaders of the confederation 
of democratic unity to urge the people not to demonstrate 
the confederation was the largest and most influential of the 
six organizations that called for the demonstration hailing 
namphys ouster nearly two weeks ago 
in a communique read over radio haiti inter the confederation 
said the macoutes are getting ready to take reprisals against 
the demonstrators 
confederation leaders told the ap the decision to cancel the 
demonstration also was influenced by reports over radio soleil of 
many calls from listeners saying that those who had perpetrated 
the massacre at the aborted nov 29 elections last year were 
going to wreak havoc on the demonstration 
thugs and soldiers killed 34 people on on nov 29 1987 the day 
general elections were being held forcing the elections to be 
called off 
the other five organizations that called the demonstration did 
not react to immediately to the confederations announcement 
dejoie whose organization is not one of the five agreed with the 
call for cancellation 
the planned demonstration had not had the support of syvio 
claude leader of the haitian christian democratic party and one of 
the most influential politicians in the democratic opposition 
claude said over radio metropole wednesday afternoon that a 
demonstration in favor of the government is a little premature 
claude said that lt gen prosper avril the new president has 
just come to power he is not in the camp of the people but in the 
duvalierist camp we ought to wait a while to see whether avril 
is on the same wavelength as the soldiers 
soldiers have repeatedly said they want to purge the army and 
government of duvalierists 
the demonstration was announced on wednesday by the leftleaning 
confederation of democratic unity the autonomous union of haitian 
workers and four other civic action groups 
hundreds of striking government workers of the state flour mill 
meanwhile demonstrated in the capital wednesday protesting the 
appointment of yves jose a duvalierist civil servant to head 
their enterprise 
the appointment of jose former general director and state 
secretary of the finance ministry under ousted president 
jeanclaude duvalier was announced over state television tuesday 
night 
a workers delegation briefly met with avril in the national 
palace to discuss the contested appointment in an interview with 
radio haitiinter ady jean maxime vicepresident of the company 
union said the delegation then reached a compromise solution with 
finance minister leonce thelusma 
strikes began wednesday in the port authority and national 
credit bank after management leadership 
on sept 17 avril was named president of the military 
government by the rankandfile soldiers of the presidential guard 
who had just ousted namphy namphy had deposed the civilian

two longanticipated indictments accusing a private 
network of illegally supplying mercenaries and arms to the contras 
steered clear of thorny questions about the groups links to the 
reagan administration or drug trafficking 
the indictments also left other questions unanswered 
thirteen men are accused of having violated the us neutrality 
act by mounting an illegal campaign to help the contras overthrow 
the sandinista government of nicaragua 
the defendants include the brother of a top contra leader the 
head of the group called civilian materiel assistance and at least 
two men reputed to have drug ties 
the latest development in the case is the governments response 
filed sept 16 to defense contentions that the neutrality act does 
not apply because the united states was effectively at war with 
nicaragua 
but the us attorneys office avoided confronting that issue 
directly in its response saying the matter should be decided in 
trial not during a special hearing requested by the defendants 
other unresolved issues include possible reagan administration 
oversight of the illegal activities the question of drug ties to 
the operation the absence of key figures among those indicted and 
the sluggish pace of the investigation which covered events in 
1984 and 1985 
the biggest question is who were the people not indicted 
says jack blum special counsel to the senate foreign relations 
committee which is preparing a report on a parallel investigation 
they are prosecuting the weakest players who by and large 
were not the movers blum said for example he notes testimony 
from his committee traced connections between cma former national 
security council aide oliver north and military intelligence but 
the indictment stopped with cma head tom posey 
two of the men who were indicted exmercenary jack terrell and 
joe adams were the most candid witnesses before prosecutors and 
congressional committees he notes they and other defendants claim 
they were working with the knowledge and cooperation of the 
government 
interim us attorney dexter lehtinen has indicated that issues 
involving north and other higherups in the reagan administration 
are in the hands of the independent counsels office in washington 
lehtinens assistant richard gregorie said that when some 
names came up in their investigation the special prosecutor told 
the miami office that the subjects had immunity 
jim wieghart washington spokesman for irancontra special 
prosecutor lawrence walsh confirms their investigation continues 
although by law he cannot comment on its targets he noted that 
walshs mandate does not include neutrality act violations the 
basis of the fort lauderdale indictments 
a key figure missing from the indictment is john hull a us 
citizen whose costa rican ranch was identified by congressional 
witnesses as a base for military operations against neighboring 
nicaragua as well as a waystation for cocaine traffickers 
the indictments do mention a march 1985 arms run to costa rica 
that congressional witnesses testified went to hulls ranch but 
the indictments never identify the shipments destination or 
mention hull 
there have been reports that hull was granted immunity by the 
special prosecutor 
i would be extremely upset if that were true blum said 
witnesses say hull was all over the place in this case 
convicted cocaine pilot gary betzner has testified hull once met 
his plane when it landed on the ranch to exchange contra arms for 
colombian cocaine 
hull has strongly denied any connection to drug trafficking but 
has acknowledged supporting the contras 
one man indicted eulalio francisco frank castro was 
arrested by the drug enforcement administration in 1983 for 
allegedly smuggling 425000 pounds of marijuana into the country 
but that charge was dropped in june 1984 the same month the 
indictment says he began training contra recruits near the gulf 
coast community of naples 
us attorney mark schnapp said castro financed the 60man 
training camp but refused to say if the money was drugrelated 
gregorie said his office decided to ignore the numerous accounts 
of witnesses who have testified to congress and talked to the media 
about the alleged armsfordrugs runs 
we had a duty to say whether their testimony was credible or 
worthwhile gregorie said 
still plaguing prosecutors are accusations made a year ago that 
thenus attorney leon kellner buckled under to thenattorney 
general edwin meese iiis pressure to put the politically sensitive 
case on hold congress investigated but both men denied making a 
key phone call and lawmakers could make no determination

a rape victim whose attacker cut off her 
arms with an ax has reluctantly given up efforts to collect a 256 
million judgment from the man after he revealed he is nearly broke 
her lawyer said 
and yet another community is trying to get rid of convicted 
rapist lawrence singleton who set off a public furor in several 
northern california communities where he attempted to live after 
being released from prison earlier this year 
mary vincent won a 256 million civil judgment in a nevada 
court against singleton earlier this year over the 1978 attack 
however her attorney mark edwards of tustin a los angeles 
suburb said monday that singleton told him during a 
depositiontaking in a san francisco hotel last weekend that his 
only income is a 600permonth social security check 
singleton has only about 200 in the bank is unemployed is 
disabled by kidney problems owns no property and has not sold the 
movie book or television rights to his story edwards said 
i guess i am going to have to give up on collecting this 
judgment for the time being but in my heart i am not going to let 
it go edwards quoted ms vincent as saying 
ms vincent is married and lives in the pacific northwest she 
was 15 when singleton picked her up while she was hitchhiking and 
raped her and hacked off her forearms 
edwards said he was contacted informally by singletons 
attorneys who offered to set up the deposition hearing 
edwards promised not to reveal information about the deposition 
for at least 48 hours after it was held to allow singleton time to 
return to his outofstate home he also agreed not to reveal where 
singleton is living 
but in pinole 30 miles east of san francisco police chief ted 
barnes told the city council monday night that singleton had been 
living there for several days 
he has some personal matters to take care of and once hes 
taken care of them he says hes moving on barnes said tuesday 
before police learned that singleton did not plan to stay in the 
town mayor phil green had said i dont want to have this guy in 
our town for 30 seconds he promised singleton would be banished 
if we have to call in the national guard 
councilman roy swearingen also had called for singleton to move 
on but cautioned the community not to overreact 
this man is hated by everyone he said im concerned that 
there will be some kind of violent act 
earlier this year singleton had been living in tampa fla

with the fighting fast and furious on 
the olympic fields the rice paddies of panmunjom seem eerily calm 
on this nomans land in limbo between south and north korea 
just an hours ride from seoul the battle being waged is one of 
symbols 
the only clear signs of the momentous sports gathering 30 miles 
away is an olympic flag taunting north korea and the signature of 
olympic swimming star matt biondi in the visitors book at camp 
bonifas the forward un command at the demilitarized zone 
more than halfway through the olympics fears of an attack by 
north korea against the games have receded 
in fact the communist north which had sought to cohost the 
games with its archrival appears to be studiously ignoring the 
international sports meet 
they havent even attacked the games in their propaganda 
said us air force capt david griffard who serves with the un 
command 
griffard is one of 375 people stationed at camp bonifas 
adjacent to the site of quonset huts where regular meetings are 
held with the north to discuss violations of the 1953 armistice 
agreement that ended the threeyear korean war 
since the olympics began most of the commentary from the 
norths loudspeakers focuses on the disappointment of south korean 
students that the games were not being held jointly in seoul and 
pyongyang the capital of north korea he said 
radical south korean students seeking unification with the 
north staged violent protests against the olympics in the months 
leading up to the games but their demonstrations have declined 
since the competitions began last week 
the men of camp bonifas about half of whom are south koreans 
have also noticed that the north is cranking up its loudspeaker 
music a little more for the constant stream of tourists visiting 
the dmz 
the blasts of music a mixture of oriental and western tunes 
are sometimes accompanied by praise for ruler kim il sung and 
exhortations to south koreans to defect 
but the souths propaganda machine is just as persistent as the 
norths 
the south koreans are encouraging visitors and reporters to take 
the opportunity to tour panmunjom making this the hottest 
attraction after the games 
as many as 18 tour buses a day cross the narrow woodplanked 
freedom bridge spanning the minestrewn imjin river and leading to 
the dmz tours offered to reporters and photographers covering the 
olympics are booked days in advance 
the visit begins with a 25minute slide presentation 
accompanied by a profusion of facts and figures about the dmz 
rattled off by a us officer 
symbols abound the americans call the mostly uninhabited gijung 
dong propaganda village the pagodalike building which serves 
as headquarters for the us and south korean armistice officers is 
known as freedom house 
less than 100 yards away north korean soldiers snap photos of 
the visiting reporters and peer at them through binoculars dont 
make any gestures to them the media group is warned 
visitors must be dressed properly no jeans shorts or 
sneakers we dont want them to think were decadent says lt 
robert feliu accompanying the group 
the troops who patrol the zone must be over 6 feet tall and over 
180 pounds in weight the north koreans tend to be shorter the 
purpose is intimidation pure intimidation says feliu 
in the battle of northsouth oneupmanship as on the olympic 
fields every inch counts 
so when the north raised its flag pole to 330 feet the south 
followed suit although the north has since upped it to 528 feet 
and the south has yet to match it 
north koreas headquarters building in the joint security area 
where the armistice talks are held is about a yard higher and 
longer than the adjacent un headquarters says cpl dale 
adkinson another military explainer but its much narrower than 
ours adkinson adds with satisfaction 
the us and south korean troops at the dmz are ever at the 
ready nothing special for the olympics says adkinson 
so on an autumn day in panmunjom the men feel as bored as ever 
the only highlight of their day is the olympic competition being 
beamed to them from seoul one hour and a world away

for those accustomed to turgid soviet 
speeches on marxist theory class struggle imperialism oppression 
of the third world and eastwest confrontation it was a revolution 
when foreign minister eduard a shevardnadze took the rostrum at 
the 43rd un general assembly on tuesday he sounded more pacific 
pragmatic and ecologically sensitive than soviet officials have 
sounded for years 
who ever thought of the ozone layer as a major soviet concern 
if one closed his eyes and listened to the englishlanguage 
translation one might not have recognized the kremlins top 
foreign policy spokesman 
shevardnadze proclaimed our vision of peaceful coexistence as 
the universal principle of international relations class 
struggle in the international arena is out he said and ideology 
is not a practical basis for conducting international relations 
there was more the senior soviet diplomat even spoke of holes 
burned in the ozone layer and the greenhouse effect of global 
warming he lamented acid rain erosion of the biosphere dying 
seas and fauna he devoted far more time and passion to 
aggression against nature than to arms control and longrange 
nuclear weapons 
we need resources to save our planet instead of destroying 
it he said 
gone were the litany of ussoviet problems and irritations 
the stark cataloging of world problems declarations on the middle 
east 
it truly was a revolutionary speech an important statement of 
soviet philosophy in foreign relations said iraqi ambassador 
ismat kittani a veteran un diplomat it was especially 
significant for its tone and style as well as its content for 
what was unsaid as well as what was spoken he added 
kittani and many other un diplomats pointed to shevardnadzes 
references to peaceful coexistence ridding foreign policy of 
ideology and improved sovietus relations which benefit the world 
the extensive references to the environment took many observers 
by surprise the urgency of shevardnadzes tone in addressing the 
globes ecological problems rivaled his past elaborations of the 
horrors of nuclear war 
faced with the threat of environmental catastrophe he said 
the dividing lines of the bipolar ideological world are receding 
the biosphere recognizes no division into blocs alliances or 
systems 
all share the same climatic system and no one is in a 
position to build his own isolated and independent line of 
environmental defense 
it is more sensible he said to abolish some military programs 
and channel funds into fighting environmental problems 
shevardnadzes third speech to the general assembly since he was 
named foreign minister emphasized what he called new political 
thinking it followed by one day the seventh and last address of 
president reagan to the 159member world body 
reagan while repeating his annual lectures on the superiority 
of us democracy and free enterprise also was significantly more 
conciliatory than in the past 
in contrast to previous years he limited his specific criticism 
of the soviet union to passing references to its human rights 
practices and he praised the thaw in ussoviet relations 
but it was shevardnadzes speech devoid of the hard news and 
headlines that attract reporters that showed the most farreaching 
reassessments in political thinking an evolution of the changing 
soviet position over the past few years since mikhail s gorbachev 
took over as kremlin leader 
it was a watershed how far the soviets have come from the 
shoepounding days of 1960 when nikita khrushchev fulminated 
against the west 
shevardnadze also repeated his calls for strengthening the 
united nations he said that while safeguarding their sovereignty 
nations should subordinate some interests to the international 
purpose of peace and to world forums

ensign karin 
berglund explained as she navigated this swedish missile carrier 
through a treacherous baltic archipelago that shes just a sailor 
like everybody else on board 
ive always been interested in sailing and the sea and i 
couldnt find anything i wanted to do more than go into the navy 
said the 25yearold officer seated at a bank of radar screens and 
navigation maps on the bridge i dont see myself as a woman in 
the navy im just one of the crew 
she is one of three women the only woman officer in the 
32member crew of the hms stockholm a 330ton corvette serving as 
the flagship of swedens hardpressed antisubmarine warfare unit 
for a nation once considered a leader of the sexual revolution 
professional military service for women came late swedens officer 
corps were opened to women only in 1980 
military life still attracts few females and many of them use 
their military training in technical professions to move into 
higher paid civilian careers 
defense ministry figures say 114 women are among the 16000 
officers in the standing and reserve services of all branches the 
highest ranking officer is col annemarie goransson a surgeon in 
the medical corps 
women are not drafted as men are but have served since early 
this century in auxiliary units as cooks cleaners or drivers more 
than 50000 women belong to these units today 
having girls on board has changed the way the men behave 
theyre much more civilized than they were said cmdr lennart 
danielsson who has women in his compliment for the first time this 
year 
unlike many ships no pinups grace the walls of the enlisted 
crew quarters where two women sleep among 12 men there are no 
curtains or special facilities but the women dont seem to mind 
it took a week or so to get used to but then it was so 
natural said sgt ewa kroog a 20yearold signals operator 
kroog said she adjusted to a male environment during basic 
training and in her signals course when she was bunked in a room 
with five other women in an otherwise allmale barracks 
of course the first week you took the towel into the shower 
with you but after that you dont think about it you get used to 
it very fast she said 
once on board ship she said it was the guys who had 
problems i knew what i was getting into when i decided to go into 
the navy the guys didnt beg to have girls here 
officers normally sleep in twoman cabins which could have been 
problematic for berglund her skipper said danielsson assigned her 
to a fourbunk cabin to avoid gossip 
shipboard romances were out said kroog who has a boyfriend on 
another ship it must be all business otherwise it wouldnt work 
down here 
the navy and air force have been more successful absorbing women 
than the army which issued a report last year that women were 
performing badly in the artillery and engineering corps but they 
often do better than men in services requiring technical ability 
the report said 
the report recommended that women remain barred from the 
cavalry armored corps and infantry which it said were physically 
too demanding the air force has no women pilots 
there is something unnatural about young girls lifting heavy 
gun carriages or running with heavy weapons the army commander 
lt gen erik bengtsson said in a newspaper interview last year 
and later came under heavy criticism for saying it 
in the navy women are not allowed to serve in submarines or as 
naval commandos where deep sea pressure could cause miscarriages 
in pregnant sailors

us olympic runner johnny l gray was 
arrested for kicking a taxi and is the third american athlete to be 
detained for unruly behavior in the past week police said today 
authorities said gray was seized by police after he became 
involved in an argument with a taxi driver tuesday night 
the driver said he blew his horn at gray because the runner was 
blocking the road gray kicked the taxi and then tried to flee but 
was caught by police authorities said 
gray was questioned at a police station then released in the 
custody of us embassy officials police said 
ron rowan an attorney for the us olympic committee said gray 
and three unidentified companions complained that the cab was 
driving dangerously and almost hit them gray was acting in 
selfdefense rowan said 
the taxi driver chased the americans with an object that 
appeared to be a tire iron but did not hit anyone before police 
intervened and detained gray rowan said 
rowan said the driver had been compensated for the damage 
the case was forwarded to the public prosecutor for possible 
action on charges of violent assault police said but the case was 
considered minor and it was unlikely that any major action would be 
taken against gray a police officer said 
gray finished fifth in the 800meter run he won the us 
olympic trials in the event and was national champion in 1985 1986 
and 1987 
police were to forward to the prosecutor today their report the 
arrest saturday of us olympic gold medalist swimmers troy dalbey 
and doug gjertsen after a marble carving was removed from a seoul 
hotel 
dalbey and gjertsen apologized for the incident tuesday 
police officials said no special consideration was being given 
to the american athletes but they indicated they did not expect 
charges to be pressed 
there have been no reports of athletes from other countries 
being arrested 
a series of incidents involving us olympic team members has 
triggered a wave of criticism in the south korean media and among 
some koreans 
newspapers have charged americans are rude and arrogant and have 
failed to behave properly during their stay in seoul 
much of the criticism appears to be part of attempts to deflect 
attention from an incident last week in which south korean boxing 
officials attacked a referee after he awarded a decision to a 
bulgarian boxer over a local favorite 
that case is also under investigation by police but there has 
been no statement on how the probe is proceeding and the case is 
rarely mentioned by the local press

the united states should not rule out the 
possibility of negotiating with terrorists to secure the release of 
american hostages former cia director stansfield turner said 
tuesday 
turner speaking at the university of kentucky said negotiation 
should be considered as a possible response to terrorism along 
with force 
referring to sundays presidential debate between vice president 
george bush and massachusetts gov michael dukakis during which 
both seemed to rule out negotiating with terrorists turner said 
the candidates said what they had to say 
they dont want to advertise to the terrorists that theyre 
going to make deals if its absolutely necessary he said as 
we hear that rhetoric we should be prepared for more deals to occur 
i happen to think without any inside information that 
theres one cooking today between iran and ourselves over the nine 
americans being held in beirut turner said 
turner a navy admiral who served as cia director during the 
administration of jimmy carter spoke to an audience of about 150

two of the nations busiest polling 
organizations have worked in nearsecrecy this election year 
harvesting opinion analyzing it carefully shielding it from 
prying eyes they are not out to make news 
they are out to win the white house 
we do states we do the nation we interpret the data and we 
make recommendations on the basis of it said irwin tubby 
harrison pollster for the dukakis campaign there is a high 
level of interest 
were doing the obvious things a few national polls a lot of 
statewide polls said robert teeter his counterpart in the bush 
campaign quite a lot of statewide polls it all depends on 
what the current problem is 
the problem is not lack of effort each of these men has more 
than 100 interviewers working the phones every day more added for 
special projects each has a hefty budget and a keenly interested 
if private audience 
neither likes to discuss his results publicly but the effect of 
their work can be seen every day in many ways polls are setting 
the agenda in the campaign for the presidency 
polling is a major part of the campaign decisionmaking 
apparatus said pollster peter hart head of walter mondales 
polling operation in the 1984 election it affects everything 
from scheduling to advertising to the very basic message components 
of a campaign 
his old nemesis president reagans pollster richard wirthlin 
agreed to understand what public attitudes are not necessarily 
whos ahead and behind is the grist that drives the strategic 
mill of the campaign 
this year the effects could not be clearer polls have put 
michael dukakis in a tank george bush in a flag factory and day 
care on page one they have encouraged sharp democratic criticism 
of bushs choice for vice president and a soft republican line on 
dukakis running mate 
behind nearly every strategic move lies a poll you have a 
choice said hart you can either make your decisions on the 
basis of your best guess or on the basis of solid information 
from polling 
as a result each campaign may spend up to 2 million on general 
election polling hart said it will probably only turn out to be 
3 percent of the total campaign budget but that 3 percent drives 
the other 97 percent 
polling long has been a marketing tool in business and its role 
is much the same in a campaign by testing themes polltakers can 
tell which issues hit the mark by testing popularity they can 
focus efforts on the states where their chances are best 
you have a limited number of resources a limited amount of 
time and a limited amount of candidates said teeter youre 
trying to figure out how to use those resources the best way you 
can to have the greatest influence on the election 
for example the bush campaign polled heavily before the super 
tuesday regional primary to decide where to spend advertising money 
and send the candidate said teeter do we spend time in florida 
or north carolina his polls found bush already had florida 
locked up we went to north carolina bush won there too 
at this stage of the general election campaign the approach is 
more tuned to broader issues and themes among them 
polls this summer showed bushs support lagging among women 
bush not vociferous on the issue before visited a virginia 
daycare center and proposed tax credits to help pay for child 
care he lags less with women now 
polls consistently have found public doubt about dukakis on 
defense last month he climbed aboard a tank in a photo opportunity 
meant to improve his image on the issue and a subsequent poll 
showed that the effort backfired he also said he supported 
research into the popular strategic defense initiative which 
earlier he had called a fantasy 
polls have found public agreement with laws requiring teachers 
to lead their classes in the pledge of allegiance and bush has 
continued to hammer dukakis for vetoing such legislation on 
constitutional grounds 
polls also have found disquiet with the qualifications of 
bushs running mate sen dan quayle of indiana dukakis brings up 
the issue regularly and hit it hard in his debate sunday with bush 
applying polls to campaign strategy can require more detailed 
analysis when bush was considering possible running mates for 
example polls pointed to sen bob dole rkan on a simple 
popularity basis but quayle was a better fit on underlying issues 
among them bushs need to assert his independence from president 
reagan with a bold stroke of his own 
still strategists are quick to stress that polls do not call 
the shots they are not alldetermining said lee atwater 
bushs campaign manager its good to have the data to help you 
make the decisions but its also helpful to have pros who know the 
flora and fauna out there 
hesitancy in the campaigns to discuss the role of polls stems 
from a fear of charges of cynical candidate packaging people 
talk about politicians responding to the polls in a pejorative 
sense atwater said 
but in fact he said from a certain standpoint i guess thats 
the way things ought to be done polls are a reflection of what 
people want he said and politicians are supposed to respond 
to what people want

vice presidential candidate dan quayle 
plunging into lloyd bentsens home turf didnt bother to mention 
his democratic counterpart but wasted no time in challenging 
bentsens running mate michael dukakis to resign his membership 
in the liberal american civil liberties union 
and while bentsen has dual races his senate reelection bid 
and the vice presidential contest quayle made it clear he also is 
operating under a dual strategy boosting the coffers of bentsens 
senate opponent and concentrating his firepower on dukakis not the 
no 2 player 
quayle has appearances today in el paso amarillo and dallas in 
his second consecutive campaign day in texas a critical state with 
29 electoral votes 
at a houston rally tuesday quayle called on dukakis to send 
back his aclu membership card 
let him renounce all their bizarre positions quayle said 
the republicans have attacked dukakis for being a 
cardcarrying member of the organization and republican george 
bush raised the issue in his debate sunday with dukakis whom he 
attempted to portray as a liberal out of touch with mainstream 
views 
quayle said that the aclu policy guide includes such positions 
as removing the words in god we trust from us currency and 
that the organization has argued for legalizing prostitution and 
drugs and advocates abortion on demand 
the aclu has disputed characterizations made by bush and a 
spokeswoman for the group said tuesday that quayle and bush were 
simplifying and misstating at the same time what we do and 
believe in 
colleen oconnor said the aclu believes the focus in dealing 
with drug users should be on education and rehabilitation rather 
than punishment a similar approach would work with prostitutes 
she said decriminalization of both she said would remove the 
profiteering and thus the availability 
dukakis aides seeking to distance the candidate from the 
organization have noted that the aclu has filed lawsuits against 
dukakis as governor of massachusetts over his plans to use 
roadblocks to catch drunken drivers and a policy effectively 
barring homosexuals from becoming foster parents 
at an el paso rally quayle said dukakis can by resigning show 
without waffling without backsliding without the famous dukakis 
shuffle that he repudiates all the outrageous positions of the 
aclu 
this is quayles first campaign appearance in texas as the 
republican vice presidential nominee bush and bentsen both call 
texas home and the texas senator has spent considerable time in 
the state campaigning not only for the national ticket but also for 
his senate reelection bid 
under a texas law passed for lyndon b johnson bentsen is 
allowed to run for the senate while also seeking national office 
quayle is attending fundraisers in the state for bentsens 
senate opponent rep beau boulter who is far behind in that 
contest 
charles black a senior bush strategist traveling with quayle 
said quayles texas appearances were designed to tie bentsen down 
and make sure boulter has a few resources and bentsen has to 
focus on the senate race 
texas is one of nine states the republicans have targeted as 
swing states that could help provide the margin of victory 
nationally 
black said quayles job in the state is to reinforce contrasts 
between bush and dukakis on the issues rather than attacking 
bentsen directly 
in fact quayle was quoted in one newspaper interview tuesday as 
saying bentsen has been a good senator and he called him a 
real gentleman 
as a matter of fact i want him to stay in the senate 
quayle told the houston chronicle 
asked whether that statement meant quayle did not really support 
boulters challenge to bentsen quayle spokesman david prosperi 
said he means that the bushquayle ticket will be victorious

british prime minister margaret thatcher 
believes it is in the western interest for soviet leader 
mikhail gorbachev to succeed in restructuring the soviet unions 
economy and increasing social freedoms 
in an interview published in wednesdays new york times 
thatcher said that what she likes about gorbachevs approach is 
the idea that enlarging the liberty and responsibility will give 
you the greater economic prosperity 
thatcher said that when she visited the soviet union last year 
i had to decide whether i thought it was in the western interest 
that he succeed and i think it is 
of gorbachevs efforts she said its a great massive 
turnaround where you have in fact been saying to people for 70 
years you dont do anything unless youve got permission to turn 
round and say well now look youve got to do quite a lot on your 
own initiative 
thatcher said britain would support the changes in the soviet 
union in every way we can without interfering she cited an 
increase in eastwest contacts and in joint ventures between soviet 
state enterprises and british companies 
but she also said that this uncertain period of change in the 
eastern bloc requires total western unity and preparedness 
she said britain would insist that the nato alliance modernize 
conventional and nuclear weapons in western europe 
thatcher said she hadnt watched the debate between presidential 
candidates george bush and michael dukakis 
im not going to get involved in your election problems for 
very obvious reasons she said

as the 100th congress rushes toward 
adjournment it finds itself increasingly tangled in electionyear 
politics and the presidential campaigns of george bush and michael 
dukakis 
even the tamest bill can find itself held hostage to political 
fortune and partisan campaigning 
proposals that have languished for years suddenly have new life 
breathed into them by lawmakers with an eye on politics home 
district polls and opponents press releases 
no single issue more sums up the electionyear mood of congress 
than the drug bill passed last week by the house and now pending in 
the senate as bush and dukakis accused each other of being soft on 
drug dealers and crime republicans and democrats in the house 
scrambled madly clamoring to lead the charge in a war on drugs 
the vote was a whopping 37530 for a package of antidrug 
provisions that even sponsors say may be unconstitutional if 
this bill becomes law americans will be less free said rep don 
edwards dcalif chairman of the house civil rights subcommittee 
but another democrat charles rangel of new york expressed the 
feelings of the majority while the bill is flawed he said at 
least all of us can go home and say we responded to our 
constituents and the nation 
with all 435 house seats and 33 senate seats up on election day 
going home is just what congress wants to do and as soon as 
possible 
senate republican leader bob dole of kansas says congress could 
adjourn this week if it would simply pass the pending appropriation 
bills and a few other relatively noncontroversial issues 
dole said many of the lateblooming issues should be left to the 
presidential election campaign and its winner we should 
determine precisely what governor dukakis and the vice president 
have in mind on these issues dole said we will have plenty of 
time next year to address each of them 
but republicans and democrats alike each have a political agenda 
that could keep them in washington well into october senate 
majority leader robert byrd dwva is telling colleagues to plan 
on weekend work and a midoctober escape 
whats keeping congress in town in addition to some money 
bills a bipartisan overhaul of the welfare system and other 
issues at least four partisan fights are running out the 
electionyear clock 
minimum wage for five days the senate debated a proposal to 
raise the minimum wage the minimum wage hasnt been increased 
since 1981 but democrats brought this plan to the floor in the 
final weeks of the twoyearlong 100th congress republicans 
filibustered saying the democrats wouldnt get action on the 
minimum wage unless they allowed senate votes on two dozen reagan 
judicial nominations languishing in committee 
byrd pulled the minimum wage bill down with both sides crying 
dirty politics 
dole complained that sen edward m kennedy dmass chairman 
of the labor and human resources committee was unleashing a flood 
of liberal social legislation just before the elections 
how many more bills are we going to get from kennedys 
committee dole asked he got his answer a few minutes later 
when the senate turned to another labor committee proposal 
family leave this bill would guarantee at least 10 weeks of 
unpaid jobprotected leave to seriously ill workers and to those 
with newborn newly adopted or seriously ill children dukakis 
supports the plan bush says women shouldnt have to worry about 
getting their jobs back after maternity leave but hasnt yet issued 
a detailed proposal 
taxes this bill makes numerous technical corrections in the 
big 1986 tax overhaul and also contains several tax breaks and the 
relatively minor tax increases needed to pay for them 
harmless 
in another year it could be approved quickly and quietly but 
this time each side has electionyear jitters 
the white house said this week it will support an amendment to 
the bill that would deny tax exemptions to hospitals and clinics 
that routinely perform abortions guaranteeing a partisan fight 
when and if it hits the floor 
on the other side byrd is afraid republicans might accuse 
democrats of raising taxes if they pass the bill 
im just suspicious of this white house byrd said tuesday 
he said he can see reagan administration officials complaining 
loudly there they go raising taxes there the democrats go 
as a result neither democrats nor republicans are going 
anywhere until the need to campaign at home overcomes the urge to 
campaign in washington

a senate tax bill that for two years has been 
gathering everything but momentum is now hung up over fears that 
president reagan will accuse its backers of favoring higher taxes 
in comparison with the giant 1986 tax overhaul legislation 
which shifted 125 billion in taxes from individuals to 
corporations over five years this bill is peanuts with a 
threeyear price tag of 23 billion 
it was launched in the summer of 1986 just to correct errors and 
clear up ambiguities in the new tax law it since has become the 
vehicle for dozens of other tax provisions whose beneficiaries 
include farmers workers who receive education assistance from 
their employers and taxpayers involved in disputes with the 
internal revenue service 
to pay for those benefits the bill would raise taxes by 23 
billion with most of the money coming from corporations 
the reagan administration has expressed support for some 
provisions in the bill and reservations about others but that is 
not good enough for senate majority leader robert c byrd who has 
implied the senate might not even consider the measure this year 
unless the administration clears up the confusion 
im just suspicious of this white house byrd told 
colleagues tuesday he said he fears that once congress passes the 
bill administration officials will pick up one of president 
reagans campaign cries of the past there they go raising taxes 
there the democrats go 
it would be well if we could get some clear unequivocal 
indubitably plain wellunderstood statement from the white 
house byrd said im just concerned the white house will stand 
on the sidelines and attack congress on the tax bill 
republican leader bob dole of kansas was asked if the white 
house will respond to byrds request 
i think they have already responded he replied they 
would support the senate bill 
but byrd said we havent gotten anything clear and 
unambiguous from the white house 
sen max baucus dmont who is managing the bill said he is 
convinced the white house supports it they agree with the 
revenueraisers he told reporters 
the latest administration pronouncement on the bill which came 
from the white house office of management and budget added another 
complication it said the administration supports a proposed 
amendment that would deny a tax exemption to any hospital or clinic 
that performs abortions when the life of the mother is not 
threatened 
the omb letter states the federal government should not 
subsidize abortion through an exemption in the tax code 
sen bob packwood of oregon republican manager of the tax bill 
and an opponent of federal restrictions on abortions said he feels 
confident that amendment can be defeated he called the omb 
endorsement a throwaway to the righttolifers 
in 1986 when the tax overhaul was being written sens gordon 
humphrey rnh and william armstrong rcolo blocked action on 
that bill with a similar amendment the obstacle was removed after 
reagan personally pleaded with the two senators saying that while 
he supported their goal he feared the controversy could doom the 
tax bill 
packwood seeking to assure byrd said the white house would 
sign the senate bill as it came out of the senate finance 
committee but any bill that moved toward the house version would 
be vetoed he added 
in comparison with the 23 billion cost of the senate bill the 
house version would cost 7 billion over three years 
among dozens of provisions in the senate bill are those to free 
farmers and some other businesses from paying the federal tax on 
diesel fuel used for offroad purposes extend expiring tax 
benefits for research employerfinanced education and legal aid 
and assistance for firsttime home buyers allow freelance writers 
to deduct expenses before their works start making money assure a 
deduction for football fans who give to their alma mater and in 
return are assured the privilege of buying season tickets

democrats and republicans alike are praising a 
sweeping welfare overhaul plan that would require some recipients 
to work for their benefits despite complaints from an advocacy 
group that the measure would drop a bomb on the poor people of 
america 
the compromise plan approved tuesday by house and senate 
negotiators is billed as the most extensive welfare overhaul in 50 
years it immediately won praise from members of both parties 
including president reagan and democratic vice presidential nominee 
sen lloyd bentsen of texas 
while workfare provisions aimed at welfare mothers provoked the 
most dispute the bill also aims to help welfare recipients help 
themselves through a combination of training education support 
services and steppedup child support collections 
house and senate negotiators formally approved the compromise 
in the works all summer on a 358 vote tuesday evening all nine 
senators voted yes each chamber must approve the compromise before 
it goes to the white house 
reagan returning to the white house from new york said he was 
very happy with the fiveyear 334 billion measure which 
contains the workfare requirement upon which his administration had 
insisted 
the presidents chief of staff kenneth duberstein said our 
indications are that in fact it is in fact a good strong 
workfare requirement which would meet the presidents test 
the reagan administration succeeded in winning a 16houraweek 
workfare requirement for one adult in twoparent households 
receiving welfare the provision affects only about 7 percent of 
the caseload would not kick in until recipients had undergone an 
intensive twomonth job search and is not effective until 1994 
but conservatives were jubilant despite the conditions 
that work requirement is indeed the nose of the camel under 
the tent said rep hank brown rcolo it is the beginning of 
a different approach to welfare 
deeply frustrated house opponents agreed with him but branded 
the requirement unfair to recipients and burdensome to states 
it does not provide education or training to make welfare 
recipients employable and does not lead to permanent jobs said 
rep augustus hawkins dcalif chairman of the education and 
labor committee it is simply a punitive approach to forcing 
people off the rolls 
some house members also said mothers required to participate in 
the work program would not receive sufficient child care help or 
safety assurances under the bill and they said people working off 
their grants in public work programs could be paid the equivalent 
of the minimum wage regardless of how much those working next to 
them were making 
but in the end many heeded the warning of rep tom downey 
dny whose subcommittee had handled the original house welfare 
bill a much more lavish proposal costing twice as much as the 
compromise 
its not as far as wed like to go but its as far as were 
going to get downey said urging his colleagues not to pump up 
welfare recipients with false hopes of a better bill to come 
the conference chairmen expressed satisfaction with their 
product 
rep dan rostenkowski dill chairman of the house ways and 
means committee called the compromise far from perfect but 
added i am confident that the families who are trapped in 
the cycle of poverty would tell us to give them a chance and pass 
this bill 
bentsen chairman of the senate finance committee said the bill 
would improve americas economic status as well as peoples lives 
you cant be internationally competitive if you have the number 
of people on welfare that we have today he said during a 
campaign stop in detroit 
the national governors association and the american public 
welfare association supported the bill but the national welfare 
rights and reform union claimed it would drop a bomb on the poor 
people of america by forcing mothers to work 
the current welfare system aid to families with dependent 
children serves 37 million families that include 7 million 
children the federal government pays out about 85 billion a year 
in cash benefits under afdc established in 1938 as part of the 
social security system 
in addition to the work requirement key elements of the new 
plan include 
600 million in federal money for a new job opportunities and 
basic skills program in its first year rising gradually to 13 
billion in 1995 states would design their own jobs programs and 
contribute matching money toward them 
parents with children under age 3 or age 1 at state option 
would be exempt from jobs participation states would have to be 
serving 20 percent of eligible participants by 1995 up to 400000 
people a year will be helped nationwide 
jobs participants would receive transportation and child care 
help welfare parents working their way off the rolls would qualify 
for a year of transitional child care and medicaid benefits up to 
475000 people are expected to continue working because of the 
transitional help 
the 23 states that do not offer welfare benefits to twoparent 
households would have to do so for at least six months of each year 
starting in fiscal 1991 that would add 65000 families to the 
rolls 
states would have to step up child support collections from 
noncustodial parents including tougher paternity determination 
requirements and mandatory wage withholding upon the court award of 
support payments 
the expense of the bill would be subsidized through a variety 
of tax moves including reducing the dependent care credit for 
higher income people and making permanent the internal revenue 
services debt collection program

illfated continental flight 1713 waited so 
long before takeoff at denver airport after a deicing that its 
wings accumulated enough new ice to hinder the jets ability to 
fly federal investigators say 
the findings of the national transportation safety board 
released tuesday said the mcdonnell douglas dc9 had been so 
thoroughly deiced that some of the deicing fluid seeped into the 
cabin 
but because of poor visibility and in part confused radio 
communications the jetliner had to wait 27 minutes in a steady 
snowfall before taking off for boise idaho 
it was airborne only a few seconds before crashing onto the 
runway killing 28 of the 82 people aboard 
the ntsb report also said lee bruecher the 26yearold copilot 
who was at the controls during takeoff rotated the plane off the 
runway too sharply causing its nose to veer up at a high angle and 
adding to its problems staying aloft 
among the dead were bruecher and capt frank zvonek 46 who had 
failed to order the jet back to the deicing pad contrary to 
airline operating procedures the safety board said in its final 
report on the nov 15 1987 accident 
the boards findings were challenged by continental airlines 
which said the investigation had not shown specifically that ice 
had accumulated on the wings of flight 1713 
the nearly yearlong investigation focused on the failure to 
deice the aircraft a second time and on the experience and 
training of bruecher and zvonek 
continentals operations manual required a plane to return to 
the deicing pad if it was delayed 20 or more minutes in the 
conditions experienced in denver that november day investigators 
said 
the failure to deice has been the cause of two other major 
aviation accidents in the past six years the crash of an air 
florida jet at washington dc in 1982 killing 78 people and the 
crash of an arrow air charter flight full of us soldiers in 
gander newfoundland killing all 256 on board 
the airline has all along maintained that the pilot of the 
departing continental jet lost control because of air currents a 
phenomenon called a wake vortex from a boeing 767 landing three 
minutes earlier on a parallel runway but the ntsb report said the 
theory had been looked at and discounted because of the relative 
position of the two planes when flight 1713 began having problems 
the safety board noted that bruecher had never flown a dc9 in 
snowy conditions and had only 36 hours of flight time in jet 
aircraft at the time of the crash he had been hired by continental 
in the summer of l987 after accumulating about 3180 hours of 
flying in propeller aircraft 
the board cited as a contributing factor in the accident the 
absence of regulatory or management controls over the operations 
of pilots with limited experience while bruecher had little 
experience flying the dc9 zvonek was a high minimum captain 
not authorized without special permission to land though he could 
legally take off under the conditions encountered at denver that 
day 
zvonek had flown 12125 hours in all aircraft including 133 
hours as a dc9 copilot but only 33 hours as a captain 
investigators said the two pilots had never flown together before 
according to the investigation bruecher had training problems 
with propeller aircraft before going to continental and in 1985 was 
fired by an air taxi company after he failed three times to pass 
his flight examination despite 30 hours of training 
at the time his examiner told the ntsb other pilots passed the 
exam after only half that much training and that bruecher had 
chronic troubles became disoriented and seemed unable to 
cope with deviations from the routine 
a year later while at rio airlines a texas commuter carrier 
bruecher failed a flight check for a more advanced aircraft and was 
described by the examiner as being behind the airplane 
after continental airlines hired bruecher in july 1987 he also 
encountered difficulties during several sessions of his formal 
simulator training for the dc9 during one session in the 
simulator he completely lost control of the aircraft with 
engine out at 2000 feet said one continental training report 
according to the ntsb 
continental spokesman bruce hicks said the airline was not aware 
of the pilots previous training problems he said when inquiries 
were made about his previous employment everything we got was 
terrific 
hicks acknowledged that bruecher had problems in one of his 
training sessions in a simulator but said he had performed well at 
other times continental has maintained that he was properly 
trained and qualified to fly the dc9

the senate has said yes to requiring plant 
closing notifications and no to raising the minimum wage now 
it is weighing whether businesses should be forced to offer 
employees jobprotected medical and parental leave 
the proposed leave act would require employers to offer at least 
10 weeks of unpaid jobprotected leave to workers with newborn 
newly adopted or seriously ill children or who are seriously ill 
themselves companies with fewer than 50 workers would be exempt 
the reagan administration said tuesday that employers should be 
encouraged but not required to respond to family needs of this 
kind and sen thad cochran rmiss said he would propose a tax 
incentive amendment reflecting that aim 
pending when the senate shut down tuesday was an amendment to 
tighten laws and stiffen penalties in the areas of child 
pornography and obscenity 
the leave act sponsored by sen christopher dodd dconn 
required at least 13 weeks of medical leave and exempted only firms 
of under 20 when it first came to the floor dodd on tuesday 
offered the substitute to reduce the leave time and the number of 
companies involved saying he was particularly concerned about big 
impersonal businesses where bosses are not familiar with their 
workers lives 
the revisions approved by voice vote mean only 5 percent of 
us companies would be affected and it would cost them 267 per 
year per covered employee a total of about 160 million dodd 
said 
all this legislation says is that for 10 weeks every two 
years if youre confronted with a crisis you dont lose your 
job dodd said i dont consider that to be an unreasonable 
idea i think its human decency i think its common sense 
congressional democrats after a protracted battle managed to 
force the administrations hand and enact a bill requiring 
companies to notify workers in advance of mass layoffs or plant 
shutdowns but the same forces trying to raise the minimum wage 
were defeated this week by a conservativeled filibuster in the 
senate 
many moderates and conservatives called parental leave an 
important benefit but fretted about the burden it would place on 
employers 
i have grave concerns about the negative effects on our 
economy that the bill could cause said sen pete domenici 
rnm we can feel real concern for those who want to spend time 
with a seriously ill child i have eight children myself and im 
inclined to support some kind of compromise on this bill 
cochran branded the requirement a very drastic departure from 
current practice and it is not really necessary in trying to deal 
with the needs of a diverse and changing workforce we should 
all be concerned about the impact it may have on other benefits 
that may be available 
the reagan administration issued a policy statement tuesday 
saying the presidents advisers would recommend a veto of the dodd 
bill in its present form 
the administration would support a proposal for parental leave 
which encourages employers and employees to agree on the leave 
policy best suited to them the statement said the 
administration would support a bill that promotes the adjustment of 
workfamily conflicts by providing incentives to employers to 
provide leave to their employees during reasonable periods at the 
birth or adoption of a child

a jury relied on scientifically invalid expert 
testimony when it decided that the antinausea drug bendectin 
caused birth defects an appeals court said in upholding a judges 
earlier decision 
the decision by the us circuit court of appeals here is the 
first to validate a lower court decision setting aside a verdict in 
a bendectin case on the ground that it was not supported by valid 
evidence 
the threejudge panel said tuesday that us district judge 
thomas penfield jackson properly ruled that the testimony of an 
expert witness for the plaintiff contradicted nearly universal 
scientific consensus 
in 1986 jackson set aside the jurys award of 116 million to 
carita richardson a 10yearold washington girl who was born 
without a right leg and with a deformed left arm and hand 
the appellate panel concluded that the experts opinion lacks 
adequate basis and therefore whether viewed alone or in 
conjunction with those of other experts did not provide the 
substantial probative evidence that would require us to leave the 
verdict as the jury rendered it 
the decision could portend a little more judicial intervention 
on scientific questions said walter olson who heads the civil 
justice reform project of the manhattan institute a conservative 
think tank in new york 
in recent years trial judges have faced a spiral of expert 
witnesses in which each side will bring in a witness who is as 
slanted toward their side as they can get away with olson said 
the jury is left with the bewildering choice between experts 
who appear to disagree on every possible point and make it look as 
if it is in dispute in the scientific world when its not quite as 
up in the air he said 
the ruling also was hailed by merrell dow pharmaceuticals inc 
which made the drug for nearly 20 years 
the decision further emphasizes the importance of focusing on 
the scientific as well as the emotional aspect of these cases 
said company spokesman bill donaldson 
merrell dow contends that the drug which was prescribed to 
treat morning sickness among pregnant women is safe but it 
stopped producing the drug in 1983 in the wake of mounting lawsuits 
the circumstances of the case are tragic and carita 
richardsons plight evokes the utmost sympathy circuit judge 
spotswood robinson wrote in an opinion joined by circuit judges 
laurence silberman and douglas h ginsburg 
but in a case such as this it not only is appropriate but 
indeed imperative that the court remain vigilant to ensure that 
neither emotion nor confusion has supplanted reason 
while expert witnesses are indispensable in a case such as 
this the court said judges are not forced to accept 
uncritically any sort of opinion espoused by an expert merely 
because his credentials render him qualified to testify 
jackson is only the second judge to set aside a jurys verdict 
against the manufacturer over bendectin the other trial judge in 
district of columbia superior court was overruled by another 
appeals court which is considering whether to order a new trial 
the company has won 22 verdicts from juries that found the drug 
was safe one of those verdicts was rendered in a joint trial of 
1150 claims against the drug 
donaldson said the company is trying to overturn four verdicts 
that the drug caused birth defects those include a 95 million 
jury award here last year that was subsequently reduced to 20 
million the jury in that case heard testimony from the same expert 
who testified in the richardson case 
barry nace the richardsons lawyer who also won the 95 million 
verdict called tuesdays decision a bad joke 
nace who vowed to appeal the ruling said it was based on 
political rather than legal reasoning 
the courts have been looking for some way to get rid of these 
bendectin cases and the hundreds of children who have lawsuits they 
want to file against the company he said 
nace said the court ignored the testimony of seven other experts 
who also testified that bendectin probably caused birth defects

lawrence b buck curtis has drilled in the 
biggest oil fields of the world on earth and at sea facing down 
the forces of nature in hopes of pulling out a core of rock 
dripping with oil 
when that happens he says you fought the odds and you won 
curtis of houston has fought the odds and won in four decades 
in the oil patch creating technology that has earned him a 
reputation as someone who has moved the industry to new frontiers 
a retired vice president of the energy giant conoco inc curtis 
was being inducted today into the national academy of engineering 
for his pioneering efforts in offshore oil production and storage 
curtis is considered the father of tensionleg platform 
technology in offshore oil and gas production that will allow 
conoco to begin unprecedented production next year in 1760 feet of 
water offshore louisiana in the gulf of mexico 
the rig will be the worlds deepest offshore production 
platform unlike a conventional platform that sits on an elaborate 
steel or concrete structure anchored to the seabed the tension leg 
platform is a floating structure tethered to the seabed with 
tubular steel mooring lines 
curtis says he believes the tension leg platform technology will 
allow production in even deeper waters as oilmen search for new 
reserves to replace depleted supplies and attempt to ease the 
nations dependence on foreign oil 
the big stuff is farther out its going to be in the 
frontier areas he says 
conoco is considering the platforms use to retrieve reserves at 
3000 feet but additional technology is needed to produce oil at 
depths of 7000 feet where curtis believes most supplies will be 
discovered 
but theres nothing that says we cant do it curtis said 
tuesday its tough technology to design but its not any worse 
than airplanes 
curtis who joined conoco in 1949 and retired from the 
houstonbased subsidiary of du pont co in january also is 
credited with installing the industrys first computerbased 
oilfield automation system and with developing 500000barrel 
undersea storage tanks for use in the waters off dubai in the 
persian gulf where no deep water port was available for tankers to 
retrieve the oil 
whether as a young engineer fresh out of the colorado school 
of mines or as a tested veteran of the oil fields of the world 
buck curtis has consistently exhibited the drive the creativity 
and the sound judgment of a man dedicated to improving current 
concepts of petroleum engineering and creating new ones charles 
dibona president of the american petroleum institute said tuesday 
at a lunch honoring curtis induction into engineering academy 
i dont feel i was a pioneer said curtis 64 i was 
trying to find a solution to a problem 
he says such technology is in the embryonic stage but must 
overcome the concern among some environmentalists that offshore 
drilling is harmful to marine life 
i dont believe anything is destructed he said it may be 
affected i think the west coast has a lot of potential and alaska 
is a frontier area that may be the biggest of all

abu nidal the palestinian terrorist who laid 
low in 1987 appears to be resuming his violent campaign with 
support from libya the top us counterterrorism official said 
l paul bremer ambassadoratlarge for counterterrorism said 
the apparent reemergence of abu nidal is indirectly linked to the 
april 1986 us bombing of libya which the reagan administration 
accuses of sponsoring various terrorist activities 
bremer also said the number of terrorist incidents worldwide 
appears to be headed for a record level of 1000 this year but the 
number of americans killed in such attacks has fallen 
the 1986 us raid on libya and western pressure has had the 
effect in the case of libya to drive the terrorism that 
libya supports into different channels so that instead of using 
diplomats and business col moammar gadhafi is doing it more 
through surrogates like abu nidal and the japanese red army 
bremer said 
us officials blame abu nidal whose real name is sabri bannah 
for machinegun attacks that killed 22 people at the rome and 
vienna airports in december 1985 
abu nidals organization also has been blamed for attacks this 
year that killed nine people on a greek cruise ship last july and 
eight in the sudan last may the tactics were similar to those used 
in the rome and vienna airport attacks 
abu nidal is believed to maintain a core operation of 300 people 
to 400 people in the libyan capital of tripoli said bremer and 
although syria closed abu nidals offices in damascus last year it 
still allows him to run training camps in the bekaa valley of 
lebanon 
despite the increase this year in the total number of terrorist 
incidents bremer said counterterrorism efforts have been helped by 
better international coordination 
we estimate at least several hundred incidents have been 
stopped by steps that we and our allies have taken over the last 
three years maybe as many as 300 some major and some not 
he said he declined to give specifics 
the bad news is that terrorism is certainly continuing 
according to the figures that we keep 1987 was the worst year 
in history we had 832 recorded incidents in international 
terrorism up from 774 in 1986 he said 
for the first six months of 1988 terrorism is up 
substantially over last year perhaps by as much as a third so it 
is possible that we will end this year with as many as 1000 
incidents maybe more which would make 1988 the worst year he 
said 
three americans were killed in terrorist incidents in the first 
half of 1988 down from 38 in the corresponding period in 1986 and 
12 in the first half of 1987 he said 
the greatest surge in terrorist incidents stems from attacks on 
pakistani civilians by agents of the kremlinbacked regime in 
afghanistan bremer said 
about half the terrorist incidents last year took place in the 
middle east and there has been an upsurge in attacks in peru and 
colombia he said 
on another topic bremer said the united states has evidence 
that tehran has sponsored terrorist incidents within the past month

heeding a decade of pressure from 
environmentalists farmstate senators say the time is ripe to 
speed up safety reviews of pestkilling chemicals some of which 
are finding their way to american dinner tables 
for the first time in many years we are hopeful that 
agreement can be reached on some simple but significant changes 
said agriculture committee chairman patrick j leahy dvt and 
four fellow senators in a letter urging support 
the bill would accelerate to nine years safety reviews of some 
600 pesticides begun a decade ago and which would not be finished 
for more than 35 years at the present pace it would send the bill 
to the manufacturers rather than to the taxpayers as under the 
current system 
the aim is to ban use of the most dangerous pesticides and limit 
the use of others which could pose a threat a number of the 
chemicals which are used to combat rodents insects and other 
forms of crop blight have been found to cause cancer and other 
severe health defects in laboratory experiments 
indemnity payments by the government to buy up stocks of banned 
pesticides would be ended for the most part they have cost 20 
million so far and even if the bill becomes law far greater 
outlays are likely before they trail off 
the bill would reauthorize the 1947 federal insecticide 
rodenticide and fungicide act whose very title might seem 
resistant to attempts to glamorize the issue 
environmentalists however sought to do precisely that tuesday 
bringing in actress meryl streep to lobby in favor of the bill 
arriving at the office of sen richard g lugar rind she said 
her chief concern was the safety of her children 
i went to cook dinner tonight and everything i pulled out of 
the refrigerator could have been harmful streep said 
lugar is among lawmakers pushing for approval of the 
housepassed measure but no lawmakers are claiming that the bill 
is the ultimate answer to the pesticide issue launched by 
naturalist rachel carson in her 1962 bestseller silent spring 
and a focus of the environmental movement ever since 
missing from the bill is any provision to get the government 
moving on a cleanup of groundwater contaminated by pesticides 
the environmental protection agency is currently surveying the 
extent of toxic chemical seepage into groundwater which feeds 13 
million wells nationwide and provides the basic drinking supply for 
117 million americans 
the capitol hillbased us public interest research group said 
recently however an inspection of epa records shows at least 34 
different pesticides in groundwater in 34 states based on 45000 
well samples 
most environmentalists are in favor of the measure but only in a 
lukewarm way some who say they oppose the bill fear that a 
barebones law with a threeyear lifespan will put the entire issue 
on ice until 1992 ruling out action on the groundwater issue next 
year 
its like there are three seconds to go until the end of the 
game and there you are on the 30yard line said compromise 
advocate maureen hinckle a lobbyist for the national audubon 
society you dont go for the touchdown you kick the field 
goal 
this isnt kicking the field goal said dave baker 
political director of friends of the earth and a critic of the

with barely a flush of anger they told tales 
of human waste spewing from train toilets onto railworkers and 
station platforms 
some accused amtrak the national passenger rail line of not 
trying to dispose of the problem 
im the one being squirted on hes amtrak official not 
being squirted and hes got the attitude george e jones of 
local 24 of the brotherhood of railway signalmen told a 
subcommittee hearing of the house government operations committee 
on tuesday 
jones and a tom matthews utah state chairman of the 
brotherhood of maintenance of way employees showed the panel a 
videotape of broadcast news stories illustrating the disposal 
problem on the rails the station platforms and graphically the 
lens of the camera 
the hearing resulted from complaints from railworkers and city 
officials whose downtown train stations have been sprayed with a 
mixture of human urine feces and shredded toilet paper as the 
amtrak trains pass through or stop 
amtrak spokesman tim gillespie told the panel the company was in 
line with federal regulations because it was exempted in 1976 by 
congress from an order to retrofit all passenger and freight 
toilets 
in addition he cited a 1978 report by the department of health 
education and welfare now the health and human services 
department indicating that there have been no identifiable 
disease outbreaks or illnesses which might be associated with 
railroad waste discharge

disease amtrak questions the advisability of spending extremely 
scarce capital and operating funds to alleviate what essentially 
amounts to a problems of aesthetics gillespie said the 
retrofitting would cost the company at least 34 million he said 
that is perhaps the most arrogant statement i have seen in a 
very long time snapped rep cardiss collins dill chairwoman

it would seem to me that amtrak would have some kind of concern

legislation 
jones the railway signalman told of a aug 17 incident near 
helper utah in which a train that had stopped to transfer a sick 
passenger to a local ambulance illegally discharged at least four

the general accounting office says converting 
a partially completed commercial nuclear reactor to a weapons 
production reactor may raise policy questions over separation of 
civilian and military nuclear facilities 
however a gao report to sen brock adams dwash said there 
were no major safety technical or other barriers which would 
preclude the washington state reactor from being considered as an 
option for the next new defense materials production reactor 
the plant 63 percent complete and owned by the washington 
public power supply system is situated on the department of 
energys hanford reservation near richland wash 
in august energy secretary john s herrington recommended 
construction of two new weapons production reactors a heavy water 
reactor at does savannah river plant in south carolina and a 
hightemperature gascooled reactor at idaho national engineering 
laboratory in idaho 
also herrington said research and development should continue 
on the possibility of converting the commercial light water reactor 
at hanford known as washington nuclear plant no 1 or wnp1 
the gao an investigative arm of congress said in a report 
dated sept 21 that while does condemnation and completion of a 
partially completed commercial power plant as a defense production 
plant do not violate the 1968 nonproliferation treaty or existing 
law it may raise policy questions 
for example such action may be criticized on the basis that 
it breaks away from the traditional separation between peaceful use 
of atomic energy and military use it said 
although doe has statutory authority to condemn the wnp1 plant 
the gao said the plants cost through condemnation is not known 
the cost could range from 30 million salvage value to 21 
billion total of the outstanding bonds 
a doe subcontractor has estimated that in addition to the cost 
of acquiring the plant the cost of completing wnp1 for production 
of tritium a hydrogen isotope used in nuclear weapons is 26 
billion 
in addition to the policy questions the gao pointed to other 
issues including 
possible need to modify wnp1s decay heat removal system 
used to remove heat from the core once the reactor is shut down 
and the stations blackout prevention system to provide auxiliary 
power in case regular sources of electric power are unavailable 
preventing recriticality a fuel meltdown condition that 
can result in an extremely severe accident the gao said this 
risk has been precluded by using 10 percent enriched uranium fuel 
rather than the 20 percent enriched fuel initially planned 
technical issues dealing with the design and manufacture of 
tritium target pins used within the reactor as well as with 
the reactors capability of meeting tritium production goals 
establishing safety requirements or standards that may be 
needed for completing wnp1 as a tritium production reactor rather 
than a commercial power facility

the air force is trying to decide whether to 
approve a contractors 520 million offer to improve the b1 bomber 
or whether to try another solution to the troubled planes 
electronic problems 
we just got the eaton corp proposal in the last month 
were looking at it and were looking at other alternatives said 
air force maj gen michael d hall 
were going to put together a plan by the end of the year but 
at this point were not sure which option we will pick hall 
said tuesday 
hall commented shortly after charles barron a representative of 
eaton said it would cost 520 million for eaton to improve the 
electronic defensive systems aboard the 100 b1s purchased by the 
air force 
that 520 million would be atop the 35 billion eaton contract 
already spent by the air force for the sophisticated computer 
systems which form the brains of the swingwing planes defenses 
the comments were made at a boston university seminar on the 
b1 which has been the subject of criticism ever since it was 
resurrected by president reagan seven years ago 
president carter terminated the plane 11 years ago but reagan 
reversed that decision saying the b1 was needed as a replacement 
for the aging b52s that are the heart of the us nuclear bomber 
force reagan also decided at the same time to go ahead with the 
radarevading stealth bomber which is known as the b2 
in 1981 reagan promised congress that the 100 b1s could be 
purchased for 205 billion a figure that has grown to 28 billion 
through inflation 
all 100 of the planes model b1bs have been delivered to the 
air force but the service has discovered that their electronic 
countermeasures systems need to be improved or the planes 
wont make it through soviet defenses and return should they be 
used during a nuclear war 
the costs to improve the b1 would be in addition to the 28 
billion already spent on the planes and some critics such as rep 
les aspin dwis chairman of the house armed services committee 
have suggested that congress should decide whether to go ahead with 
the improvements or spend the money for other weapons 
rep dave mccurdy dokla a member of the house armed services 
committee told the seminar the problems with the b1b are real 
and have to be fixed 
mccurdy said aspins suggestion about halting improvements 
wasnt likely to be fulfilled 
no were not going to park it he said thats not a 
realistic suggestion at this point since weve already bought and 
paid for the plane 
but we do have to make some decisions about what to do 
mccurdy said the eaton proposal is very interesting id not 
heard that 520 million figure before 
barron said the eaton proposal would correct flaws identified by 
the air force theres no fatal flaw in the b1b he said 
pentagon officials again defended the plane tuesday as they 
have in the past 
dan howard chief pentagon spokesman said its the best 
manned bomber in the world its light years ahead of any other 
bomber 
brig gen robert e dempsey of the strategic air command said 
can it do the mission i would say absolutely so although he 
added range would be a consideration

the use of animals in research is appropriate 
despite the pain suffered by the animals involved the national 
academy of sciences has concluded 
research with animals has saved human lives lessened human 
suffering and advanced scientific understanding the academy said 
in a report tuesday from its research arm the national research 
council 
the report was written as a response to the animal rights 
movement it noted that the animals used in research often die and 
recommended more frequent use of animals abandoned in pounds and 
shelters 
this document says that in the best judgment of people with 
diverse opinions it is appropriate to use animals in research for 
human welfare said dr dominick p pirpira one member of the 
committee that wrote the report it is the job of humans to care 
for each other 
another panel member christine stevens president of the animal 
welfare institute refused to sign the report she said it 
underestimated the amount of animal abuse in laboratories 
nationwide 
the report is scientifically flawed factually inaccurate 
morally unenlightened defensive and a disservice to animals and 
people said people for the ethical treatment of animals peta 
also charged the report was tainted because it was paid for by the 
national institutes of health and pharmaceutical companies that use 
animals in research 
about 20 million animals mostly rats and mice are used by us 
researchers yearly and fewer than 200000 of the more than 10 
million unwanted animals killed in pounds or shelter in the united 
states annually are released to researchers

syndicated columnist carl t rowan a longtime 
gun control advocate now being tried on weapons charges says he 
thought the pistol he used to shoot a backyard intruder was exempt 
from local registration laws 
closing arguments were set to begin today in rowans trial on 
charges of using an unregistered handgun in the june 14 shooting of 
a teenager who had taken an uninvited dip in the columnists 
backyard swimming pool 
if convicted of the misdemeanor charges the 63yearold rowan 
could face up to two years in prison and a 2000 fine 
district of columbia superior court judge arthur l burnett said 
tuesday that jury deliberations would begin immediately after 
prosecutors and defense lawyers finished summarizing their cases 
rowan told the jury on tuesday that in 1982 his son then an fbi 
agent left the 22caliber pistol in his fathers bedroom after 
the columnist received death threats from persons purporting to be 
members of the ku klux klan 
i was getting a lot of threats after vernon jordan former 
head of the national urban league was shot they said youre 
next nigger rowan testified 
rowan said his son was told by district police officials that he 
had a blanket exemption from the citys tough handgun 
registration laws because he was a federal agent 
he said police also told his son there would be no problem 
if rowan sr handled the weapon 
earlier rowans son carl jr testified that twice in 1982 and 
once when he was preparing to leave the fbi in 1983 he was told by 
police that he did not have to register weapons he had purchased 
for personal use 
after telling police that other members of his family might 
handle the weapon they told me that as long as it was where it 
lawfully should be if others have access to it it isnt a 
problem rowan jr testified 
rowans attorneys have maintained that the columnist and his son 
were given inaccurate advice by members of the police departments 
gun control unit about the citys gun registration policy which 
stipulates that a weapon can be used only by its registered owner 
police inspector james r lee introduced by rowans attorney as 
an expert witness on gun registration matters said tuesday that 
while rowan broke the law by using the unregistered weapon he 
should not have been prosecuted because he thought he was acting in 
selfdefense 
detective charles j jones who arrived at rowans house 
immediately after the june 14 shooting told the court that a 
sliding glass door at the rear of the house showed signs that 
someone had tried to force it open 
however jones could not say when the door was damaged 
rowan has said he shot benjamin smith 18 of chevy chase md 
because he was afraid smith was trying to enter his house smith 
who was shot in the wrist has said he was trying to leave the 
property when rowan shot him 
jones testified that evidence indicated that the shooting had 
taken place at close range near the door

on the second night of its season the 
metropolitan opera presented a series of firsts 
handels 1724 giulio cesare set in egypt in 48 bc was 
sung at the met for the first time 
trevor pinnock a british early music specialist whod never 
conducted an opera before conducted 
the met never before had a countertenor male alto on its 
stage in giulio cesare it had two 
kathleen battle was the vocal star of tuesday evening singing 
cleopatra her voice is delicate but so focused that it never 
sounds weak sound comes from her like a golden thread the 
coloratura passages arent especially glittering from miss battle 
because all her singing is sweetly spun gold 
the musical style vocal and orchestral was exemplary the 
orchestra of only 30 pieces did not consist of original 
instruments which often are out of tune handels music has 
serenity as beautiful melodies are stated repeated and 
embellished without haste pinnock managed to conduct so that often 
there also was urgency and excitement 
tatiana troyanos sang julius caesar she began with much florid 
singing making a strenuous effort to get it right which she did 
but sounding as though she had about half a voice in the last 
acts florid singing her voice was much fuller and rich though 
effort could still be heard her julius caesar didnt step forward 
as an operas title character should 
jeffrey gall a native of cleveland made his met debut as 
ptolemy cleopatras brother a countertenor role his voice is 
interesting and not unpleasant though it doesnt sound entirely 
human it sounds like a cross between a female mezzosoprano and 
words coming through a hollow reed 
the other countertenor whose role as cleopatras confidant is 
smaller is derek lee ragin who was born in west point ny and 
grew up in newark his voice sounds warmer and more a cross between 
a mezzo and a tenors falsetto 
sarah walker as the wife of pompey and martine dupuy as their 
son were exceptionally effective in large parts bass julien 
robbins also was admirable as commander in chief of ptolemys army 
one of the operas few low voices 
the production was created by the english national opera in 1979 
and has been performed at the san francisco opera and in geneva 
switzerland the womens costumes are lavish and dont attempt to 
look egyptian gowns are basically elizabethan with bustles and 
ruff collars 
the concept of the stage sets was pleasing each scene had a few 
pillars or monuments or thrones before scenes ended singers would 
step forward and a screen would drop behind them so the stage could 
be changed for the next scene it was orderly without being 
symmetrical 
john copley in charge of production john pascoe sets and 
michael stennett costumes were making met debuts 
this opera is remembered here for the new york city opera 
production which transposed the title role so that bassbaritone 
norman treigle could sing it and it made the cleopatra beverly 
sills a star

foreign minister eduard a shevardnadze 
says the soviet union has suspended the withdrawal of its troops 
from afghanistan because of persistent violations of a 
unnegotiated agreement 
also tuesday soviet leader mikhail s gorbachev told the united 
states and pakistan to come to their senses and stop arming the 
guerrillas fighting the communist afghan government 
in remarks reported by the official tass news agency gorbachev 
said pakistan was trying to install leaders in neighboring 
afghanistan to its own liking despite the wishes of the afghan 
people 
at the united nations shevardnadze said the soviets have not 
yet begun the second stage of their withdrawal from afghanistan 
half a soviet force of more than 100000 troops had pulled out by 
aug 15 
lets wait and see he told reporters it is necessary to 
stop the violations that take place it is the most important 
thing 
in a speech to the general assembly earlier he asked the five 
members of the un security council to discuss violations of the 
withdrawal agreement with afghanistan and pakistan 
as soon as soviet troops began to withdraw a nonstop 
production line of violations was set in motion said 
shevardnadze 
he did not name pakistan but the soviet union has filed 
numerous complaints with the united nations complaining that 
pakistan is allowing usbacked guerrillas to launch raids into 
afghanistan from bases in pakistan 
this cannot be allowed to happen he said were not 
complaining to anyone we have the means to make things fall into 
place but we are responsible to the united nations and therefore 
are appealing to it 
the unbrokered withdrawal accords signed in geneva on april 
14 by pakistan and afghanistan with the united states and soviet 
union as guarantors called for the soviets complete its pullout by 
feb 15 1989 
the soviets sent troops into afghanistan in 1979 after an 
invitation from a moscowbacked communist government in kabul 
pakistan has been a major backer of about 200000 
antigovernment guerrillas who have used it as a base of 
operations the united states and china have also lent support to 
the rebels 
us secretary of state george p shultz said in new york that 
the security council whose five permanent members are the united 
states the soviet union britain china and france would meet 
friday and could discuss violations of the withdrawal accords 
but he said the united states does not recognize the afghan 
government and would not invite it to join the meeting 
he said the afghan government should stop violating pakistans 
air space with war plane overflights and air raids on guerrilla 
camps 
pakistans foreign minister sahabzada yaqubkhan said that since 
april 14 afghanistan has violated the accords with air raids and 
terrorism 
he told the general assembly tuesday that the afghan air force 
has launched 387 air and ground violations of pakistani territory 
causing 40 deaths and injuring 114 people 
he also accused afghanistan of sponsoring terrorism in pakistan 
saying afghan agents mounted 259 attacks in 1987 killing 264 
people and wounding 1069 since the afghan accords there have 
almost 70 more terrorist attacks killing 74 people and injuring 
55 he said

hugh harris one of the old hands 
around the kennedy space center was asked to resolve a problem by 
a novice reporter treading the space beat for the discovery launch 
well work it in real time harris said the reporter looked 
puzzled heck in the old days everyone would have known he meant 
well cross that bridge when we come to it 
its all so different now 
the veteran space reporters the ones who covered the vanguard 
missions in the early days and grew old writing about the mercury 
gemini apollo and skylab flights came back at the start of the 
shuttle program in 1981 for this new era of ships launched like 
rockets orbiting like satellites and returning like airplanes 
but public interest faded shuttle launches stopped being a big 
deal and when challenger blew up on that freezing day in 1986 the 
journalists at the launch site could be counted in the hundreds 
television networks had long stopped watching 
this is 1988 and the space program has taken its lumps the 
russians got ahead and things are pulsing again there is a 
shuttle on the pad the hotels are full and the excitement has 
returned to the cape 
its a different kind of excitement more subdued a little 
apprehensive the memory of that awful fireball in the sky is still 
too fresh and nobody thinks of space flight any more as routine 
theres a new crowd here some people who werent even born when 
alan shepard took his little hop down the atlantic and who wouldnt 
know an eva from mtv for gosh sakes 
there are people in cocoa beach now who couldnt name the seven 
original astronauts if their lives depended on it who dont 
remember when the starlight motel was a hangout for americas 
heroes our astronauts 
these are folks who think of sesame street when you talk about 
the bird and who ask such questions as why is the fuel tank 
pointed on top answer for the same reason that automobiles are 
not shaped like cubes 
more than half to twothirds of the people never have been 
here they dont know what theyre hearing or where to go 
harris who has been running the nasa newsroom it seems forever 
said of the new crop of reporters who got the space assignment for 
this one 
you can spot them easily grabbing every piece of paper put out 
on the newsroom counter by a beefed up corps of nasa spokesmen and 
women and dont think the space agency which has taken a 
battering since challenger isnt taking advantage of this 
opportunity to shine 
its spruced up its auditorium to get rid of the tacky 
backgrounds that used to be the hallmark of news conferences its 
got tv lights and a fancy modernistic logo and representatives who 
will do standups and speak for the agency whenever they are asked 
and canny old nasa is sneaking in briefings about every program on 
its drawing boards and even bringing in experts who dont speak in 
acronyms 
ask any of the oldtimers who reminisce about the apollo 12 
launch struck by lightning in the rain what is different and 
theyll say the people 
the look and the feel of the place is different less 
adventurous somehow 
sure there are a few signs in the towns around go 
discovery good luck discovery crew and yes the chamber 
of commerce has somehow made green ribbons the symbol of upward and 
onward 
but none of the fever of the 1960s when two gemini spaceships 
were going to rendezvous for the first time and when apollo 8 flew 
to the moon circled it on christmas and came home again or even 
in 1981 when john young and bob crippen took the shuttle columbia 
up for the first time 
this crowd takes it more for granted now and that probably 
accounted for the surprise when challenger blew up spaceflight 
never was safe and nobody whod been around it ever thought it was 
since challenger the shuttle has been surrounded by so many 
protections it will be a wonder that it gets launched at all 
we went from guidelines to rules said anne mccauley 
speaking for the air force which presides over weather and range 
safety for the shuttle and senior master sgt mike beeman said 
a jet aircraft can take off in any kind of weather but when you 
launch the shuttle his voice trailed off as he held up a thick 
packet of rules 
theyre all more serious about this thing traditionally 
industry representatives have provided coffee and doughnuts in 
their own press center and theyve given away all manner of 
trinkets from sun visors to rain jackets to little shuttle decals 
to put on briefcases 
thats all gone all they hand out now is information

british prime minister margaret thatcher says it 
will be in the western interest for mikhail s gorbachev to 
succeed in his efforts to reshape the soviet union 
in an interview published today in the new york times mrs 
thatcher was asked what particularly appeals to her about 
gorbachevs policies she said its the idea that enlarging the 
liberty and responsibility will give you greater economic 
prosperity 
mrs thatcher interviewed in london on tuesday said when she 
visited the soviet union last year she wondered whether it would be 
in the western interest for gorbachev to succeed she has 
decided it would be mrs thatcher said 
concerning those efforts the prime minister said its a 
great massive turnaround where you have in fact been saying to 
people for 70 years you dont do anything unless youve got 
permission to turn round and say well now look youve got to do 
quite a lot on your own initiative 
mrs thatcher also said britain will support the changes in the 
soviet union in every way we can without interfering she cited 
an increase in eastwest contacts and in joint ventures between 
soviet state enterprises and british companies 
but she also said this uncertain period of change in the eastern 
bloc requires total western unity and preparedness 
she said britain will insist that the nato alliance modernize 
conventional and nuclear weapons in western europe 
on another subject the prime minister said she didnt watch the 
debate between presidential candidates george bush and michael 
dukakis 
im not going to get involved in your election problems for 
very obvious reasons she said

much of love canal has been declared 
safe for resettlement and nunzio loverdi who spent years trying 
to stay in the neighborhood that became synonymous with chemical 
contamination vowed to be the first back 
your home is your home no matter what happens to it loverdi 
said tuesday im going back 
state health officials announced tuesday that hundreds of former 
love canal residents may return to the homes they left after the 
neighborhood was declared a disaster by president jimmy carter 10 
years ago up to 80 other families were hoping the study would 
confirm their decision to stay in their homes near the former 
chemical dump site 
the state health commissioner dr david axelrod said that as a 
result of state and federal cleanup efforts most areas of love 
canal contain no more chemicals than other neighborhoods in this 
industrial city 
axelrod met with about 200 former residents tuesday night to 
announce his findings axelrod said however that some blocks 
remain unsafe affecting about 10 families 
the longanticipated finding was hailed by former residents who 
feared that their neighborhood would be left boarded up and mostly 
abandoned as a symbol of environmental disaster 
we didnt want to be a symbol of anything we just wanted our 
lifestyle back said loverdi a retired laborer who led a group 
of renters fighting city and state plans to tear down the lasalle 
housing project and other homes in the area 
loverdi was among the renters evicted this spring from the 
project where state officials never found contamination it is 
scheduled to be torn down because it would cost too much to 
renovate 
niagara falls mayor michael olaughlin said axelrods decision 
will be good for the city of 71000 which borders canada and the 
famous falls 
it wont mean a landslide of people moving back olaughlin 
said but it will mean the city will begin to put the nightmare 
behind it 
phyllis festor president of the niagara falls board of 
realtors said the city is having a real estate boom and that 
housing prices have increased in the love canal area during the 
last three years 
the decision was so long in coming that for most people it 
doesnt matter anymore she said 
former resident lois gibbs who now heads a washingtonbased 
environmental group said that despite resettlement love canal 
would always remain a monument to disaster 
ms gibbs pointed out that while most of the residential areas 
may be free of chemicals that only meant the chemical threat had 
been contained not removed 
ms gibbs said the state would have serious liability problems 
if new contamination were discovered in resettled areas 
love canal an abandoned waterway was used by the hooker 
chemical co to dispose of thousands of pounds of chemical wastes 
in the 1940s the company made herbicides and pesticides 
in the 1950s the canal and its contents were filled in and 
homes and an elementary school were built on top it wasnt until 
the early 1970s that residents began to notice foul smells in their 
basements and oily puddles in their yards 
they also began to notice higherthanusual incidences of 
miscarriages birth defects cancer leukemia neurological 
disorders allergies epilepsy and suicide 
there were near riots at town meetings in the late 1970s when 
the dangers from the chemicals were revealed to residents 
eventually 728 homes in a 50block area were evacuated the 
elementary school and 228 houses were demolished 
the state and federal governments filed multimilliondollar 
lawsuits against hookers parent company occidental petroleum 
corp much of that litigation is pending 
the dump site has been fenced off and surrounded with clay and 
plastic liners to prevent the chemicals from leaking into the air 
or ground water corroding drums of dioxins and other chemicals 
have been separated and complex runoff and monitoring systems built 
as part of the state ruling a committee of local officials will 
create a plan to resettle the neighborhood and assist homeowners in 
renovation

department and related agencies reagan signed on tuesday 
the board is to establish a national film register labeling 
movies according to their cultural historical and aesthetic 
interest and then report on alterations such as colorization that 
are made in a registered film

the pentagon has more than doubled its 
collection of spare parts and other materials under president 
reagans military buildup leaving the defense department unable to 
properly manage the stockpile a congressional report concludes 
the enormous unprecedented and unsustainable growth in the 
pentagons secondary inventory has simply overwhelmed the 
pentagons depots warehouses and accounting and control 
systems the study issued tuesday by the senate governmental 
affairs committee said 
the study of socalled secondary items such things as 
spares repair parts supplies food and clothing has grown from 
43 billion in value in 1980 to 94 billion 
the report the latest study by the democraticcontrolled panel 
on defense inventories said the pentagon is still doing a poor job 
of managing the stockpile despite reforms 
concluding that management of the materials has not kept pace 
with the pentagons ability to spend money on new goods the 
report said the defense department should reduce the growing volume 
of items it has in its inventory

the teamsters union must wait until monday to 
mail out ratification ballots on a newly renegotiated threeyear 
contract covering some 20000 drivers of auto transport trucks 
us district judge royce c lamberth issued a temporary 
restraining order on tuesday prohibiting the union from mailing the 
ballots for five days dissident teamsters complained that a 
quickie vote would preclude them from raising a campaign to 
defeat the accord 
the teamsters had planned to mail out the ballots today on a new 
tentative contract reached with some 30 auto transport companies 
late last week 
an earlier tentative accord reached in july was rejected by 72 
percent of the covered members in the union prompting a reopening

the bulky orange pressure suits are 
far less comfortable than the coveralls shuttle crews once wore 
and they take forever to put on but they could be lifesavers for 
discoverys astronauts 
the 75pound suits never before worn into space are to be worn 
only during takeoff and landing and come packed with parachutes 
lifeboats and radios they are part of a new escape system 
including a telescoping pole and an escape hatch that was devised 
in the aftermath of challenger although it would not have helped 
in the disaster that killed seven astronauts 
its not a very comfortable thing to walk around in but its 
got a lot of capabilities said roly rice project engineer for 
the escape system at nasas johnson space center 
its so uncomfortable in fact that nasa has cut the launch 
window the span in which liftoff could occur from three to 2 
hours to reduce the time the five crew members must spend on their 
backs inside the orbiter while dressed in the garments 
the astronauts also will have to wake up about 30 minutes 
earlier than previously on launch day because it takes extra time 
to put the suits on 
during the first four shuttle flights astronauts wore 
lesssophisticated pressure suits that were to be used in 
combination with ejection seats in case of a launch emergency but 
after the shuttle was deemed operational the seats were 
removed and the suits replaced with simple coveralls 
the rogers commission which investigated the 1986 challenger 
explosion urged the space agency to return to some type of escape 
system nasa after considering several possibilities picked the 
escape hatch and pole 
the most likely use for the escape system would be if the main 
engines failed during launch and prevented the shuttle from 
reaching orbit if the crew were unable to return to the kennedy 
space center runway or make an emergency landing overseas it would 
until now have been faced with ditching the shuttle in the ocean 
a prospect nasa officials consider unsurvivable 
the new system provides another option letting the astronauts 
bail out before the shuttle hits the ocean 
in such a scenario commander richard h hauck would ditch the 
external fuel tank and try to steer into a controlled gliding and 
subsonic flight 
at 30000 feet astronaut george nelson would blow an explosive 
hatch that would deploy the new curved telescoping pole the cabin 
would have been vented at 40000 feet so the pressure inside would 
be equal to the outside to avoid an explosive decompression when 
the hatch is blown 
the pole would jut out from the side of the orbiter and each 
astronaut would attach a ring to it and bail out beginning at 
about 25000 feet 
they basically just dive out head first down the pole rice 
said 
he said the crew should be able to bail out in about two minutes 
parachutes attached to their suits would be triggered 
automatically although they could also be opened manually the 
suits have water wings and a lifeboat stored in the prachute pack 
would open before the astronaut lands in the ocean 
each suit includes a radio a flare kit and motion sickness 
pills rice said 
theyll the astronauts be about a mile apart each in the 
ocean depending on when they exit the shuttle rice said 
to help in case the astronauts do have to leap into the 
atlantic 18 air force parachute rescuers were dispatched last week 
from florida to gambia and morocco on africas northwest coast 
well be there to catch them if they fall said tech sgt 
john smith before leaving for benguerir morocco where he heads 
the group of jumpers deployed there 
each of the two ninemember jumper groups is assigned to a c130 
hercules cargo plane that would home in on signals from emergency 
transmitters the astronauts carry with them explained the 
squadrons commander col edward behling 
the jumpers along motorized rubber boats and medical supplies 
would parachute from 3000 feet into the water near where the 
astronauts were located they would pick up the astronauts and wait 
until they could be rescued by a ship or helicopter 
nasa officials first wanted the suits to be blue but decided to 
make them orange after realizing they would be more visible in the 
ocean 
the escape system could be used on liftoff only after the solid 
rocket boosters finish firing and peel off from the orbiter two 
minutes into flight the challenger explosion occurred 73 seconds 
after takeoff when the device would have been no help 
the system also could be used on landing if the astronauts find 
they are coming down short of the runway at edwards air force base 
calif and need to bail out

the mayors office has added 200000 to the 
citys potential tab for hosting the oct 5 vice presidential 
debate bringing the estimated cost to 900000 
the cost includes about 43000 the city will pay to buy out a 
heavy metal rock concert by the scorpions that had been 
scheduled for the city auditorium mayoral aide kevin collison said 
tuesday 
the cost of staging the debate between sens lloyd bentsen 
dtexas and dan quayle rind increased largely because the city 
was forced to switch the debate site from the orpheum theater to 
the city auditorium collison said 
the auditorium was the second choice of city officials who said 
they could not afford the 200000 needed to buy out three shows of 
the musical cats that were scheduled over two days at the 
orpheum 
collison said other costs including new chairs and a new 
lighting system have driven the price tag for the auditorium 
higher than had been forecast

the soviet union says it will turn a 
controversial radar complex into an international space research 
center and has asked the united states to follow suit with radar 
sites in britain and greenland 
soviet foreign minister eduard shevardnadze made the offer 
during a speech at the 43rd general assembly on tuesday 
shevardnadze said the disputed radar complex in siberia near the 
city of krasnoyarsk could be used by a world space organization 
the united states has said it will not sign a treaty to cut 
superpower nuclear arsenals unless moscow agrees to dismantle the 
radar which is not yet completed 
us officials say the radar violates the 1972 antiballistic 
missile treaty because it is not on the outskirts of the soviet 
union facing outward as the treaty requires 
earlier this month soviet leader mikhail s gorbachev made a 
proposal similar to that of shevardnadze he also suggested the 
united states take appropriate action concerning its disputed 
phasedarray radars in greenland and britain which the soviets say 
violate the abm treaty 
by doing that we would not only lay the material groundwork 
for international cooperation in space but would also strengthen 
the abm treaty regime shevardnadze said tuesday his statement 
appeared to be the most specific soviet proposal yet concerning the 
disputed radars 
the speech came a day after reagan delivered his seventh and 
final address to the 159member world body 
the soviet minister shared reagans view of the benefits of 
improved sovietus cooperation and supported the presidents call 
for an international conference to strenghten the global ban on 
chemical weapons 
but he criticized reagan not by name for lecturing the world 
body on the supposed superiority of us democracy and respect for 
human rights 
why can the great american people have their own great dream 
and why should the cuban or the nicaraguan the angolan or the 
vietnamese people be deprived of the right to have their own 
ideals he asked

a new disposable diaper is designed to keep 
babies dry without chemicals and plastics that take centuries to 
disintegrate in landfills 
the biodegradable diaper introduced at a news conference 
tuesday along with 2yearold twin models buck and elizabeth is 
made of a newly developed plastic 
the material contains a starchfree additive that allows the 
material to be attacked by insects bacteria and enzymes in a 
landfill environment said suzanne sheltonfoley marketing vice 
president of rocky mountain medical corp a small publicly owned 
greenwood colobased company that has been selling a 
chemicalfree diaper for about a year 
the new diaper called the chemicalfree tendercare 
biodegradable takes about two years to biodegrade compared with 
an estimated 200 to 400 years for the typical disposable diaper 
she said 
the company that developed the plastic which ms sheltonfoley 
declined to identify plans to use it in other disposable consumer 
products such as garbage bags she said 
like rocky mountains chemicalfree tendercare diaper the new 
product does not contain chemical polymer salts used by other 
manufacturers in disposable diapers to absorb wetness 
such chemicals can cause eye and respiratory irritation when 
inhaled ms sheltonfoley said though she acknowledged that rocky 
mountains diapers are not as absorbent as those containing such 
chemicals 
dr richard rosenbaum a former pediatrician founder and 
chairman of rocky mountain said many parents are concerned about 
using diapers that contain chemicals although he did not know of 
any evidence that they caused health problems 
dr sidney hurwitz a yale university pediatrician and chairman 
of the american academy of pediatrics dermatology section said in 
a telephone interview that chemicalcontaining diapers pose no 
health threat to babies 
although he said he was not familiar with the new product the 
idea is great provided its safe i think everybody is 
interested in things that are biodegradable 
ms sheltonfoley said tests on babies have shown the product is 
safe 
a canadian company has made biodegradable diapers but rocky 
mountains product is the worlds only chemicalfree 994 percent 
biodegradable diaper she said 
rocky mountain has hired a diapermaker to manufacture the 
product which should be available to consumers by mail or through 
catalogs in december she said 
like the companys chemicalfree diaper the product will cost 
59 for a box of 294 newbornsize diapers about 35 percent higher 
than others on the market ms sheltonfoley said the higher price 
is due to costs associated with mailing and manufacturing 
rosenbaum said he believes parents will be willing to pay more 
for the product 
parents want to know that mother nature can degrade the 
diapers after they are deposited in the county landfill and they 
dont want chemicals added to their infants diapers he said

after watching crops shrivel in the 
summer and harvests shrink in the fall farmers have another 
drought worry before next springs planting erosion 
each little raindrop is like a little bomb said james 
pingry a us soil conservation service agronomist 
anywhere theres been drought the risk of erosion is 
greater said scott argabright an agronomist at the soil 
conservation services midwest national technological center in 
lincoln neb 
in iowa conservationists said tuesday the record pace of corn 
and soybean harvests by farmers trying to prevent further crop 
damage will only accelerate fall plowing and other fieldwork to 
prepare for next spring 
stripping away the residue of the last crop and turning the dirt 
over always has the risk that wind and water erosion will carry off 
exposed topsoil 
but this years drought left the soil drier than usual that 
means if the land is plowed it will be especially vulnerable to 
wind erosion jim ayen state resource conservationist for the 
soil conservation service of the us department of agriculture 
said in an advisory urging farmers not to plow this fall 
theres a definite correlation between plowing or tilling in 
the fall and moisture loss said james gulliford director of the 
iowa department of agricultures soil conservation division the 
best way to conserve that moisture is not to till 
in addition to unusually dry conditions drought damage to crops 
reduced the residue in the soil after the harvest cutting the 
natural protection available to soil left unplowed argabright said 
dry soil also is vulnerable to greater than usual water erosion 
raindrops break bare soil into tiny particles and water carries the 
particles away pingry said 
fall field work is often prompted by a belief that some soil 
types can be better prepared for the spring by removing crop 
residue and turning the soil over a practice gulliford said he 
does not believe is supported by research 
other farmers use as much time as available before bad weather 
sets in to prepare fields out of fears that a wet spring will delay 
planting preparations 
we dont feel theres proven economic evidence that fall 
plowing pays off gulliford said 
while iowa farmland was saturated with moisture when last 
springs planting season began a report monday said only 2 percent 
of the subsoil and 46 percent of the topsoil had adequate moisture 
a year ago 81 percent of the subsoil and 90 percent of the topsoil 
had adequate moisture and an additional 10 percent of the subsoil 
and 8 percent of the topsoil had surplus moisture 
in minnesota the years heaviest weekly rain fell last week and 
was quickly soaked into the ground unlike downpours in normal 
times there was very little standing water in fields 
in north dakota topsoil moisture is only 17 percent adequate 
and subsoil moisture is just 2 percent adequate in missouri 
topsoil is 60 percent short of moisture 
stewart melvin an agricultural engineer with iowa state 
university said fall tilling could interfere with how much 
moisture gets back into the soil 
the drought has already done the deep tillage work the cracks 
in glacial till soils will let a good rain infiltrate deep into the 
soil and recharge moisture levels you want to leave those cracks 
open melvin said 
glacial till soils deposits formed by the passage of glaciers 
are found throughout northcentral iowa 
whats got conservationists concerned this fall is that the 
rapid harvesting will leave lots of extra time available for field 
work 
normally by this time of year just 9 percent of iowas corn and 
7 percent of the states soybeans have been harvested 
but this years corn crop already was 36 percent harvested at 
the start of the week and the soybean crop was 30 percent 
harvested 
with the harvest out of the way an industrious farmer might 
begin field work for next spring said pingry 
we definitely would encourage them not to do this he said

mission control was a sea of quiet 
and prelaunch preparation today but after a long hard 2 
years an air of expectancy engulfed the center of the nations 
manned space program 
a lockdown of the control room last week put a freeze on any 
equipment changes and only authorized personnel a few controllers 
babysitting the cape canaveral countdown were allowed in today 
flight controllers have been given several days to adjust their 
body clocks because many must work through the night during the 
fourday mission at 430 am thursday a full team is to assemble 
at their johnson space center consoles to guide discovery into 
orbit a few hours later 
the flight will put nasa back in the shuttle business after 32 
months mission control takes over command of the mission just as 
the shuttle clears the launch tower in florida 
theres a sort of lets do it now attitude said steve 
nesbitt the public affairs officer here who was at the microphone 
when the challenger blew up january 1986 its been a long hard 
2 years for people throughout nasa 
some almost cant believe the time has actually come 
this is much like the excitement before sts1 the first 
shuttle flight said astronaut michael coates who is scheduled 
to fly discovery in february everybody you pass in the hall the 
first question is hows the countdown going 
said tim pelischek an engineer here you hear people say that 
theyve been waiting 2 years for this and then all of the sudden 
its just three days away and they cant believe it i think its 
more real to the flight director people but i think people are 
getting excited about it finally 
after working seven years at nasa pelischek finally gets to see 
a launch he worked on the new escape system for discovery and was 
to go to kennedy space center to help troubleshoot lastminute 
problems 
a small crew of flight controllers are monitoring the countdown 
at kennedy checking communications equipment and keeping track of 
weather conditions 
other controllers come in periodically to check documents they 
will need and to assemble creature comforts such as coffee cups and 
trash cans 
theyre going to be living out of that room for the next 
week said brian welch a spokesman at johnson 
outside the center merchants are expecting an increase in 
business as hundreds of journalists from around the world gather to 
cover the fourday mission 
as of tuesday 152 journalists registered here about 2400 
broadcast and print journalists have signed up to come to the 
center but officials expect that many of them actually will cover 
the mission from kennedy and then fly to edwards air force base 
calif for the landing 
in the surrounding community business signs carry greetings for 
discoverys five crew members and residents eagerly await the 
liftoff 
i am naturally very excited and very optimistic about the 
flight you cant put your finger on it but theres always a 
certain amount of excitement here when were ready to go into 
space said irene kochiss who lives in nearby friendswood 
of course they are going to be fine she said adding of 
course ill say a prayer for them

from portable toilets to souvenir stands 
and first aid stations the space coast is geared up for the 
tourists who are coming to watch the shuttle launch and maybe 
spend some money while theyre at it 
nobodys ever ready for something like this but we are more 
prepared than we have ever been in the past said ralph mcmullen 
director of the brevard county tourist development agency 
the countys 8300 hotelmotel rooms and 4000 campsites are 
filled the roads are heavy with traffic and restaurants and 
merchants for 50 miles up and down the coast are doing a booming 
business and today is only tminus one the day before the nation 
is scheduled to resume its space program 
tourism officials and business people are ecstatic their 
green for shuttle go program is turning out to mean greenbacks 
as well as the green lapel bows being worn by residents and 
visitors alike 
but all is not peachy 
police and transportation managers warned of traffic deadlock by 
the time the shuttle is due to lift off at 959 am thursday 
traffic backups are expected into the next county on state roads 
50 and 520 and the beeline expressway as county and local officials 
expect the mass of visitors to equal or surpass other launch 
crowds including the apollo moon missions and the first shuttle in 
1981 some advance estimates of this weeks crowd have reached 1 
million twice the number here for the first shuttle flight 
were excited about the launch i love space id love to be 
on the flight said cletus schiermann here with his wife 
dorothy from webster groves mo 
hotels as far away as daytona beach and orlando were getting 
business from space buffs and many of the tourists are expected to 
be stuck on the highways at launch time 
the majority of the time traffic is going to be at a 
standstill said sheriffs lt vernon weekly 
at least 250000 people are expected to vie for viewing spots 
along the banks of the indian river in and around titusville the 
selfstyled gateway to space thats home to 43000 residents 
cars vans and motor homes have already staked out choice areas 
all of this means megabucks says joe catrambone executive 
vice president of the titusville area chamber of commerce 
and if the launch is delayed extending visitors stays and 
bringing in more tourists this weekend we could double or triple 
what we could take in catrambone said 
on top of the freespending tourists a record 5000 journalists 
have been accredited and most are expected to be here far 
surpassing the previous high of 2700 nasa officials said 
the media are spending money everywhere said mcmullen 
then of course there are the invited vips who will have to do 
little of the sweating in getting around or the worrying and 
jostling for good viewing spaces 
about 2000 of them including at least 50 members of congress 
actor john travolta former astronauts and a saudi arabian prince 
will watch the liftoff from a special nasa vip site seven miles 
from the launch pad another 2000 overflow invitees will be on the 
nasa causeway 
the destruction of shuttle challenger 2 years ago is far from 
forgotten in this area that depends on a healthy space industry for 
much of its livelihood but the prevailing sentiment is optimism 
and its just like old times for some veteran bartenders too 
at rainbows restaurant and bar in cocoa beach they are serving a 
red white and blue concoction made up of grenadine cocoa creme 
and a mintflavored blue liqueur 
theyre called shuttle shooters

space shuttle launches had become such a matter 
of course by the morning the challenger lifted off 2 years ago 
only the cable news network and nbcs west coast version of 
today had live coverage 
the network news divisions have rediscovered the space program 
if only temporarily and will all have live coverage of the 
discovery launch scheduled for 959 am edt thursday even the 
network anchors will be on the scene in florida 
if they go back to taking off like 747s heading for paris 
well go back to a protective stance fairly quickly i would think 
but this is a major first and its going to be covered very much 
like the first shuttle launch said abc news vice president jeff 
gralnick 
its the us going for the gold said ed turner executive 
vice president of cnn its a huge gamble to reestablish 
ourselves as a force in space 
presuming a smooth launch the networks probably will not stay 
on the air for more than an hour or so abc and cbs are going on at 
930 am nbc which is covering the olympics will break in just 
before launch 
the attention to discovery is natural since it is the first 
manned us space shot since challenger but it remains to be seen 
whether the networks will continue to find the launches compelling 
enough for live coverage cnn will continue to cover space shots 
live since they are as turner said a natural for an allnews 
network 
what im curious about is how sustained will the interest 
be he said will the interest as reflected by the television 
ratings be for just that one spike or will there be sustained 
interest in the space program as it once had i tend to think there 
wont be weve sort of done it before and this is a return to 
glories past nonetheless were covering the hell out of this 
thing 
though they didnt go live nationally in 1986 the other 
networks had protective coverage in case anything went awry when 
challenger exploded they immediately broke into regularly 
scheduled programming and stayed on the air for hours as the 
tragedy sank into the public consciousness the coverage cost the 
networks a combined 9 million in lost advertising revenues 
we had begun to believe and i think we were wrong in 
believing this that shuttle launches were becoming routine said 
lloyd siegel executive producer of nbc news special coverage 
while everyone has every expectation that this launch and 
succeeding launches will be safe and successful challenger showed 
us you cannot take this sort of thing for granted

an apartment building that collapsed last 
year would be rebuilt and the families of the 28 workers killed 
would share in the profits under a settlement proposed by a 
mediation panel a newspaper reported today 
the proposal to settle cases stemming from the april 23 1987 
collapse of the lambiance plaza in bridgeport is contained in a 
memorandum written by the panel and obtained by the hartford 
courant 
i have heard about it and i think it is an excellent idea 
said joe eagan business manager of the iron workers union in new 
haven which lost seven members in the collapse 
the panel named in a bid to settle all litigation in the case 
is composed of us district judge robert c zampano and superior 
court judge frank s meadow 
lawyers representing the families and workers met with the 
judges last week and accepted the proposal according to the 
memorandum dated sept 21 the courant reported 
the panel met with defendants attorneys tuesday to outline the 
settlement proposal those attorneys have until friday to respond 
to the proposal the courant reported 
on friday hopefully we will have something a little bit more 
concrete meadow said 
attorneys familiar with the case who asked not to be identified 
told the courant they didnt know what was the total amount of 
money available for the settlement but they speculated it could 
range from 20 million to 30 million for the plaintiffs with an 
additional 20 million for other damages and for settling contract 
disputes 
the memorandum said the judges are still working to include 51 
million in the settlement for proposed federal safety fines the 
fines were levied against the contractors by the federal 
occupational safety and health administration 
the building was partially erected when it collapsed federal 
investigators blamed the equipment used in lifting huge concrete 
floor slabs into position a construction method known as lift slab 
according to the proposed settlement the building would be 
reconstructed under a court trusteeship part of the income and 
profits from the project would be distributed among the families of 
those killed and the 14 injured workers according to the 
memorandum the courant reported 
i love that idea said rep christopher shays rconn 
whose district includes bridgeport first and foremost the 
victims need compensation and there is not much to go around but 
secondly this would be a very important thing for bridgeport to 
have this meaningful project come out of the ashes 
before the accident the building was hailed as a symbol of 
rebirth for the old industrial city 
under the plan the connecticut housing finance authority which 
financed the building would finance the reconstruction an 
attorney for the agency refused to comment tuesday to the courant 
the meetings with the defendants included representatives of the 
companies and government agencies that participated in the project 
at the closeddoor meetings the judges told each defendant what 
they were expected to contribute participants told the newspaper 
the judges also applied pressure in a bid to avoid years of 
litigation the newspaper said

and the public refusing to talk about the musclebuilding and 
illegal steroid stanzolol found in his system after he won the 
100meter dash as the worlds fastest human 
but on the flight from south korea he denied using the drugs 
even though olympic officials said the results were indisputable 
i got nothing to hide johnson told the boston globe during 
the flight to new york where he then boarded another plane for 
canada i dont want to tell no names but somebodys smiling 
today 
its not the only thing in life to win a gold medal johnson 
said i still have my parents my family still loves me 
stripped of the gold and banned for life from canadian teams 
johnson cried in the back of a limousine that whisked him to his 
mothers home in suburban toronto after the grueling trip from 
seoul 
theres no gold now just disappointment said boyd plaxton 
26 of saskatoon saskatchewan one of 200 people on hand when 
johnsons plane landed 
if he had come home with the gold in tact there would have 
been a million people here plaxton said 
chaos spoiled a giltedged moment for a man who had run 100 
meters in the fastest time ever 979 seconds 
johnson surrounded by a phalanx of security guards ducked into 
a car and made a mad dash for the door when he arrived at the 
house but he apparently forgot his key and had to return 20 
minutes later with his shirt over his head 
johnson spent the 1 hour 40 minute flight from new york in the 
planes cockpit to avoid reporters 
on the way to new york however he stayed in the passenger 
cabin appearing calm throughout the flight the globe said 
as passengers realized who he was some sought autographs a 
group of flight attendants swarmed around johnson for a photo 
first i was shocked but after a while i dont care 
johnson said when asked what he felt after he was informed he had 
failed the drug test 
in canada a parade in his adopted hometown was canceled and 
promoters backed out of deals or announced their ties with the 
sprinter would expire quietly 
sports minister jean charest said johnson had tested negative 
for drugs in august and had passed eight tests in two years he 
called the stripping of the medal a national embarrassment 
johnsons family and close friends also denied he took steroids 
i know my son doesnt take drugs i know he hasnt done it i 
know it said his father ben johnson sr from falmouth 
jamaica in an interview with the toronto globe and mail 
ben loved mom too much to discredit her in any way said his 
sister claire rodney of suburban toronto 
johnson had dedicated his gold to his mother gloria and the 
canadian people it was surrendered to canadian olympic officials 
before the family left south korea on monday 
right now hes just relieved to be resting at home he wants 
to be with people who love him now not the hypocrites who 
abandoned him ms rodney said outside her mothers house 
he looks great being at home is the best medicine for him 
said ms rodney my brother is not a druggie 
his personal physician dr george astaphan also said no 
steroids were dispensed 
i never gave him any and he never told me he took any 
astaphan said in an interview in a baggage claim area 
hundreds of canadians rallied to the sprinters side 
police escorted a woman to the door of johnsons mothers home 
so she could deliver a card with more than 1000 signatures from 
canadians who sympathized with your personal devastation 
in toronto a group of restaurant employees chipped in about 
350 to charter a plane that circled the city with a banner 
proclaiming we believe you ben 
in montreal johnsons fans said they were disappointed 
the last flicker of hope just died said danny planetta who 
was watching tv at a bar when he heard monday night that johnson 
had tested positive for steroids 
when he won we won and we were raving about it the guy 
was a hero and now he is just a big disappointment

cambodian prince norodom sihanouk in favor 
again in washington after a past alliance with the communist khmer 
rouge is expected here next month for meetings with president 
reagan and secretary of state george shultz 
sihanouk will meet with reagan oct 11 and shultz the following 
day on prospects for peacefully ending the 10year vietnamese 
occupation of his country state department spokeswoman phyllis 
oakley said tuesday 
sihanouk who in the 1970s condemned american imperialism 
and lived in exile in china and north korea has been the leading 
symbol of cambodian nationalism during the past 40 years and 
the united states strongly supports him mrs oakley said 
sihanouk met shultz in thailand last july the same month he 
resigned as president of the antivietnamese resistance coalition 
in cambodia which included the khmer rouge 
mrs oakley said he continues to lead one of the two 
noncommunist groups struggling to free cambodia from vietnamese 
aggression and his leadership has been an important element in 
rallying the cambodian people and strengthening international 
opposition to vietnams illegal occupation 
she said the united states insists on complete withdrawal of all 
vietnamese troops and restoration of genuine selfdetermination 
sihanouk 65 has been in and out of favor with the united 
states and in and out of exile the past two decades 
vietnamese forces invaded cambodia in 1978 and forced the khmer 
rouge from phnom penh after almost four years of brutal rule 
vietnam earlier this summer said it had withdrawn about 13000 
troops and plans to have the last of the estimated 100000 soldiers 
stationed in cambodia removed by 1990 
sihanouk started patching up relations with the united states in 
a 1980 washington visit that included talks at the state department 
and with members of congress and cambodian refugees

years of neglect and wanton commercialism 
of fishermans wharf could be dead in the water according to a 23 
million plan to revitalize the waterfront 
the plan was announced tuesday by a coalition of city officials 
fishing interests and residents and comes years after the wharf 
became a commercial dock for tshirt shops and souvenir hawkers 
tainting its once shining reputation as a thriving gold rushera 
fishing village 
thirty years ive been waiting for this said pat flanagan 
head of the committee that helped develop the plan 
people dont come to san francisco to look at secretaries in 
the highrise buildings quipped flanagan who owns standard 
fisheries on the wharf 
at a news conference mayor art agnos announced that marketing 
studies conducted for the port of san francisco indicate that 
fishing industry improvements at the wharf can be financed without 
revenues from a commercial development 
the preceding mayoral administration had proposed funding 
improvements at fishermans wharf from the construction of a 
highrise hotel on pier 45 
at one time it appeared that this vital industry was going to 
be allowed to die because of lack of investment in modernization 
agnos said i am delighted we have at last been able to develop 
a plan for preservation and expansion of our fishing industry 
under the plan which officials hope to begin by 1990 the hyde 
street pier would be converted into a working pier for fishermen 
containing 88 new berths for active commercial fishing vessels and 
transient berthing 
the pier also would have a threeberth marine fuel station a 
work dock and hoist a convenience store restrooms and showers for 
fishermen 
the study by a consulting team showed that enough industry 
demand for space on the pier exists to make fish handling viable 
the fishing industry believes a wharf address will enhance the 
marketability of their product said carol brown one of the 
consultants they foresee developing a product trademark 
fishermans wharf seafood that will have the same appeal as 
fishermans wharf sourdough 
she said the project will cost an estimated 228 million with 
the funds to come from state and federal grants revenues generated 
from the plan and perhaps an outside developer 
our studies show that individual businesses can thrive here 
brown said the bay area is a very large market for fresh fish 
and the diversity of our population provides a market for fish 
products that do not have mass appeal elsewhere 
the plan is under review by the citizens advisory committee of 
the fishermans wharf redevelopment project the committees 
cochair chris martin said this project will succeed where others 
have failed because of the citys commitment to the fishing 
industry instead of merely commercial interests 
this is without question without compromise explained 
martin who also manages the cannery at the wharf a complex of 
shops and restaurants the other proposal was conditional on 
the hotel 
along the wharf plastic carvings of sailors and rugged 
fishermen have replaced the real thing and neon signs promoting 
every conceivable touristtype item permeate the waterfront 
however tourists still flock to one of san franciscos most 
popular attractions though at times they come away disappointed 
its kind of touristy along the strip said derek schroder 
of tucson ariz visiting the wharf on tuesday but we like the 
restaurants here

portauprince haiti ap haitis new military leaders met 
with three former presidential candidates and agreed to restore the 
constitution but balked at setting an election date a spokesman 
for one candidate said 
the government seems to desire the advancement of the 
democratic process said claude roumain political director for 
marc bazin one of the former candidates 
lt gen prosper avril haitis new president and sgt joseph 
heubreux met tuesday with bazin gerard gourgue and louis dejoie 
jr local radio stations said the three former presidential 
candidates belong to a prodemocracy group called committee for 
democratic understanding 
they asked avril for a return of the constitution which was 
approved by referendum but later suspended by lt gen henri 
namphy who was ousted as haitis leader in a sept 17 coup by 
lowerranking members of the presidential guard 
avril administrative head of the army under namphy was named 
president by heubreux and other coup leaders heubreux is believed 
to be running this impoverished caribbean country in concert with 
avril 
the principle of a return to the suspended 1987 constitution 
was admitted by the new government amendments will be considered 
only when a new duly elected legislature is in session roumain 
said 
our points of view differ however on a date for elections 
the committee and the military government agree nevertheless that 
the date will be set by an independant electoral council and not 
by the de facto government roumain added 
avril and heubreux have met with other political factions but 
have set no timetable for bringing democratic rule to haiti 
haiti was ruled for nearly three decades by dictators francois 
papa doc duvalier and then his son jeanclaude baby doc 
duvalier the younger duvalier was swept from power by a popular 
uprising in february 1986 and fled to france 
namphy exiled now to the dominican republic led a provisional 
government after duvaliers departure that was interrupted for four 
months in june by the civilian presidency of leslie manigat 
manigat was elected in militaryrun balloting that was boycotted 
by the most popular presidential candidates and marked by 
widespread irregularities 
what might have been the nations first free elections in 30 
years were thwarted last november when armed thugs killed at least 
34 people at polling stations

us treasury secretary nicholas f brady gave 
world financial leaders a formula for relieving third world debt 
and leftists smashed bank windows in a protest against the talks 
more than 100 people were arrested during tuesdays scattered 
demonstrations police said 
brady said creditors should act to slash crippling third world 
debt but only in ways that private markets accept he also ruled 
out turning over risky loans from private banks to governments and 
their taxpayers 
if we embark on a course that involves the transfer of risk 
from the private to the public sector a true and lasting solution 
to the restoration of sustained growth among debtor nations will 
have escaped he said in tuesdays speech 
several hundred demonstrators on tuesday marched from the 
offices of the west german drug company schering to a subway 
station police said some masked marchers hurled pieces of 
pavement at the windows of a bank said a police spokesman who 
spoke on condition of anonymity 
riot police hauled away about 100 of the demonstrators said a 
police spokesman who asked not to be identified 
earlier tuesday about 160 leftist radicals threw stink bombs 
and tried to block traffic to west berlins tegel international 
airport police said four people were arrested 
the violence followed about four hours of rioting in downtown 
west berlin monday night when leftist militants smashed many store 
windows dragged a car across a major boulevard and battled with 
police about 130 people were arrested and several protesters as 
well as police officers were injured according to witnesses and 
police 
the protests coincide with the annual meeting of the world bank 
and the international monetary fund with most of the finance 
ministers from 151 member governments attending the sessions of 
the sister organizations which make international loans for 
development projects will continue through thursday 
the leftwing protesters accuse the bank and fund of 
impoverishing the third world by forcing nations to adopt austerity 
measures to meet the 12 trillion in debt to international and 
private banks as well as other governments 
brady who was making his first appearance on the international 
stage at the formal opening of the talks tuesday recommended 
several devices to reduce debt one of the most important is the 
use by banks of the money owed them by debtor countries to buy 
shares in industry in those countries 
brady left for washington right after his speech on tuesday 
without giving any public indication whether or not he was 
criticizing a proposal by satoshi sumita head of the japanese 
delegation 
sumita governor of the bank of japan outlined details of the 
japanese plan earlier tuesday it would convert some third world 
debt into bonds thus further delaying repayments the bonds would 
be backed by money from the debtors themselves and held in trust by 
the fund 
the japanese plan has been viewed as a rival to the reagan 
administrations baker plan which calls in part for providing 
new loans to developing countries that enact economic 
liberalization policies brady on tuesday defended the baker plan 
devised by former treasury secretary james a baker iii 
treasury secretary gustavo petricioli of mexico whose country 
is one of the heaviest debtors with bills amounting to 104 
billion appealed for still other means of reducing debt 
some mexican debt was being sold last month for 48 cents on the 
dollar

aids will strike 150000 more people around the 
world this year more than in all previous years combined an 
independent report said 
the report released tuesday by the independent study group 
panos institute also said the virus that causes aids appears to be 
spreading at the rate of one victim a minute worldwide 
the study aids and the third world said an increasing 
number of countries are imposing aidsrelated restrictions on the 
entry of foreigners or citizens returning from abroad 
worldwide it seems likely that a new person becomes infected 
with the hiv aids virus every minute said the 200page report 
during 1988 150000 new cases of fullblown aids are expected 
as many as are thought to have occurred in all the years of the 
epidemic so far 
last week dr jonathan mann director of the world health 
organizations aids program said in vienna that he estimates 1 
million new aids cases will be reported within the next five years 
a number consistent with the panos institutes projections 
however he provided somewhat different numbers for the total 
aids cases worldwide he said said 111000 cases have been reported 
to the health organization so far but he estimated the total 
number of cases in the world is at least 250000 
between 5 million and 10 million people are infected with the 
virus but have not yet developed aids he said 
aids acquired immune deficiency syndrome weakens the bodys 
defenses against disease it is spread primarily through sexual 
contact and the sharing of syringes by drug addicts in countries 
where blood is not screened it can also be spread through blood 
transfusions no cure has been discovered 
by mid1988 176 countries had joined the world health networks 
aids reporting network 138 had reported cases of the disease and 
151 had established national aids committees the panos institute 
report said 
measured by the number of victims per million inhabitants the 
report said the worst affected country is french guyana on the 
northeast coast of south america with 113 reported cases among its 
82000 people 
of the 20 most heavily stricken countries 19 are african or 
caribbean the study said the other one the united states is 
fifth on the list with 65780 cases in a population of 244 million 
by june 1988 29 countries had imposed aidsrelated restrictions 
on the entry of foreigners or citizens returning from abroad 
double the number for the preceding 12 months the report said but 
it said research on restrictions has frequently run into 
conflicting information 
those listed as having restrictions are belgium belize 
bulgaria china costa rica cuba cyprus czechoslovakia egypt 
hungary iceland india indonesia iraq libya mongolia papua 
new guinea philippines poland qatar saudi arabia south africa 
south yemen the soviet union syria thailand the united arab

the soviet basketball team today 
defeated the united states 8276 in an olympic grudge match 
breaking a us basketball winning streak that began in 1972 
it wasnt the best of days for carl lewis either the american 
lost his bid for a second consecutive gold medal grand slam when 
joe deloach beat him by less than a stride in the 200 meters 
leaving lewis with a silver medal 
lewis already has a gold in the long jump and was awarded the 
100meter gold when ben johnson was disqualified for taking 
steroids 
the soviet basketball victory advanced to the team to the 
goldmedal game 
i am very happy and thank you united states basketball 
said coach alexander gomelski whose team played several us pro 
and college teams as it tuned up for the olympics 
as it did 16 years ago in munich this ussoviet matchup came 
down to the final few seconds 
at one point the soviets led 5137 but the americans trimmed 
it to 7976 with just three seconds left 
but after a soviet free throw the americans were hanging their 
heads on the bench while the soviets exchanged highfives 
danny manning most valuable player of kansas national 
collegiate championship last spring didnt score a point 
i dont know what to say said manning i had a chance to 
do some things out there but things just werent falling 
together 
david robinson led the americans with 19 points and 12 rebounds 
in 1972 at munich america met the soviet union for the gold 
medal and after the final three seconds were played twice because 
of referee error and a scoreboard malfunction the soviets won 
5150 
so angered was the us team that it refused to accept the 
silver medal this time the americans can win a bronze medal

an unemployed couple who defected to the soviet 
union a year ago in search of a better life are back home and 
determined to claim what they say were incentives from the us 
government to return 
by monday we will be broke so we are going to move into the 
us courthouse in erie to live theodore branch 42 said 
tuesday from a small motel here 
branch and his wife cheryle 40 said that after soviet 
officials gave them a furnished apartment and jobs at radio 
moscows north american service officials at the us embassy in 
moscow offered them the same benefits plus help resolving their 
troubled finances if they returned to the united states 
but state department officials in washington said the branches 
were offered only the same loan available to any stranded us 
citizen to finance passage to the united states 
they made promises there and now they are backing out 
branch said 
the couple will look for work but do not plan to stay with any 
of their relatives in the area because its not up to our 
relatives to take care of us he said 
the branches moved to the soviet union last october because we 
were so mad at the us government but not at the people 
were really mad now he said 
branch said that after arriving in moscow the soviets asked 
them to visit the embassy because american officials were worried 
about them he said they refused because we vowed we would never 
step inside another federal building they werent worried about us 
there why would they be worried about us here 
the soviets asked them in february to assure the us embassy 
that they were not being held against their will branch claims 
that during a subsequent meeting jill farrellybyrnes the 
embassys second secretary and vice consul said do you need 
money we have jobs for you we have a place for you to live and 
medical care 
at an august meeting the embassy officials said they could not 
help solve their problems unless the branches returned to the 
united states he said 
no one greeted them in washington as promised branch said 
i think we have been deceived we have been stripped of 
everything said mrs branch it is hard to believe that in a 
democratic society two people could be in such a predicament 
the branches want to be reimbursed for their 3000 airfare to 
return home and for their motel room 
we wouldnt be here looking for a job if they hadnt promised 
us branch said 
branch said they might return to the soviet union but are 
tired of moving back and forth across the ocean at somebodys 
whim 
the troubles that made the soviet union look good included the 
couples inability to collect 10000 in back wages from central 
florida broadcasting co despite a federal court judgment in their 
favor the two had worked for a radio station run by the company 
which filed for bankruptcy reorganization 
land they owned in erie county was declared part of a flood 
plain by the federal government and is worthless mrs branch said

other antireagan slogans painted on it it was not damaged except 
for a bent propeller said cooper 
federal aviation administration investigators examined the plane 
and found that it had fuel in it and no apparent engine defects 
it kind of points to the fact he did it crashed it on 
purpose said faa spokesman john evans 
police sgt jerry senkir said the pilot faced possible 
additional charges for carrying what authorities suspect was a 
false passport and for landing in the park 
scattered around the landing site were leaflets titled

demonstrate disapproval of the criminals in washington and to save

prevent students and buddhist monks from fleeing to border regions 
to carry on the fight for democracy arrivals at this frontier 
rebel camp said today 
there are tens of thousands of students and monks who want to 
leave the cities but cannot said ko ko a 35yearold teacher 
from rangoon who arrived tuesday at this camp of about 500 ethnic 
karen rebel soldiers next to the thai border 
gen saw maung who seized power in a sept 18 coup ended weeks 
of massive prodemocracy demonstrations last week by ordering 
troops to fire on protesters 
the official death toll since the coup is about 350 although 
western diplomats believe more people have been killed 
on tuesday burmese who fled to the rebel stronghold of ghay baw 
bo said they saw soldier summarily execute unarmed protesters who 
took to the streets to agitate for democracy 
soe hlaing a 36yearold lawyer from pegu said he saw nine 
people executed by soldiers on a bridge in the town of tharrawdy 
during his flight to the karencontrolled areas 
each was shot with a gun one bullet to the heart soe 
hlaing said 
a student from the rangoon institute of technology said he 
witnessed the sysematic killing of 10 persons in mudon south 
of the coastal city of moulmein 
many antigovernment student leaders have gone underground to 
escape the brutal suppression fleeing from militarycontrolled 
cities to wild frontier areas controlled by ethnic rebels who also 
are fighting the central authorities 
in kle day ko ko said the army is blocking routes we came 
here because the army is killing students 
he said troops are manning roadblocks in mangladon district of 
rangoon and kyaito district of pegu about 40 miles northeast of 
the capital 
students have been forced to take detours and are traveling at 
night to avoid the checkpoints said ko ko who has been writing 
underground antigovernment pamphlets under a pen name since 1975 
about 270 students have straggled into kle day and ko ko quoted 
them as saying they plan to take up arms to fight the clique that 
has repressively ruled burma for 26 years and crippled the 
countrys economy through isolationist economy policies 
we cannot fight with simple weapons said ko ko pointing to 
handmade catapults sharpened bicycle spokes known as jinglees 
and swords he said students reaching the frontier who have formed 
an all burma students democratic front will try to get arms from 
other countries he said 
min ko naing one of the top student leaders in rangoon left 
the capital the day after the coup and plans to join his 
compatriots at the border region ko ko said 
the karen armys vice chief of staff maj gen tamala baw said 
he received instructions from karen leader mo bya that 200 students 
will leave kle day for ghay baw bo about 40 miles away to receive 
military training with another 400 students already there 
other students will go to bases closer to military installations 
in the countrys interior he said 
tamala baw said the karens will ask international organizations 
to help feed the burmese students escaping to the regions under 
rebel control 
this border area is controlled by the karen national union 
which claims to field 17000 guerrillas and is allied with nine 
other rebel groups under the national democratic front the front 
does not include the burma communist party which wages its own war 
against the central government from bases along burmas border with 
china 
the karens and other minorities have denounced the rangoon 
government for breaking promises to allow them greater autonomy 
under a federal system of government which strongman ne win 
abolished after seizing power in 1962 
ne win resigned in july but is widely believed to still lead 
the government from behind the scenes

chinas ruling communist party issued a strong 
warning today to its 47 million members to end reckless spending 
and graft which have plunged the nations 10yearold economic 
reform program into crisis 
the party which of late had preached a more relaxed line 
allowing some criticism of central policies published a frontpage 
editorial in its paper the peoples daily demanding unity and 
discipline 
the individual must submit to the organization it said 
the party central committee and state council have repeatedly 
ordered reductions in the scale of capital construction and 
forbidden party and government organs to do business but these 
still go on to an unbearable extent 
the editorial said those who dont abide by the partys 
discipline must be punished 
the warning came as the partys policymaking central committee 
met for a third day in beijings great hall of the people to 
approve a twoyear moratorium in price reforms and other measures 
to reduce inflation of more than 20 percent 
the meeting of the 175member committee is closed and there has 
been no word on its proceedings since monday when the official 
xinhua news agency said the session opened with delivery of a 
report by party general secretary zhao ziyang 
the highest inflation in two decades intermittent panic buying 
and hoarding a late summer run on banks and widespread 
profiteering have convinced party leaders that the economy is out 
of control and that a pause in economic reform is needed to restore 
order 
a party work meeting before the central committee session 
announced that restoring order would be the main task of the next 
two years putting planned price and wage reforms on hold 
xinhua said zhao reiterated this decision in his report 
the peoples daily editorial emphasized the importance of the 
new policy and the need for united action to achieve the top 
leaderships goal of modernizing the long stagnant economy by 
replacing cumbersome central planning with market mechanisms 
the party insists it has not deviated from this longterm goal 
although chinas worsening inflation is in part due to loose 
central bank control and the overissuing of currency a major 
factor has been the failure of provincial and local officials to 
comply with repeated orders to approve fewer loans and spend less 
money on new office buildings and imported luxuries 
most of the purchases of cars televisions computers furniture 
and expensive appliances that have boosted national consumer 
spending to record levels in recent months have been made by 
government offices and staterun factories 
officials including party members also have contributed to the 
economic problems by engaging in black market profiteering and 
graft party discipline and morale which never recovered from the 
leftist purges of the 196676 cultural revolution has crumbled in 
the face of the getrichquick temptations presented by chinas new 
prosperity 
the peoples daily lectured our party is the faithful 
representative of all chinas peoples we cannot become a party 
of just one region just one department or just one work unit 
the partys central leadership always comes first 
this emphasis on discipline and central leadership does not 
contract the development of democracy it added maintaining that 
strong central discipline is necessary for openness and reform 
the editorial did not specify what punishment would be meted out 
to party members who disregard the call to fall in line 
it also gave no indication whether the central committee plans 
steps to remove the economic temptations that have led to 
widespread corruption 
for example with prices only semidecontrolled many goods can 
be bought both at low prices in state stores and high prices on the 
free market a common trick is to buy large quantities of an item 
at low state prices and resell them for profits on the free market

prime minister margaret 
thatcher made a surprise visit to strifetorn northern ireland 
today amid intense security against a terrorist attack 
mrs thatcher who escaped an ira assassination attempt at a 
1984 conference of her governing conservative party was to meet 
businessmen and members of the security forces in several areas of 
the province 
for security reasons the northern ireland office said no

danny morrison publicity director of sinn fein the iras legal 
political wing said the fact that mrs thatcher could only visit 
northern ireland when her travel arrangements were kept secret and 
when she was guarded by thousands of soldiers and police shows 
how vulnerable she feels and just how tenuous is british rule 
here 
the outlawed irish republican army is fighting to oust britain 
from predominantly protestant northern ireland and unite the 
province with the roman catholic irish republic under a socialist 
government 
the ira has stepped up its attacks on british soldiers this 
year killing 27 in northern ireland mainland britain and 
continental europe 
in the october 1984 ira bombing of the grand hotel in brighton 
where mrs thatcher and several hundred conservative party members 
were staying five people were killed 
a huge security operation swung into action when mrs thatchers 
plane touched down at the andergrove royal air force base outside 
belfast this morning 
accompanied by her husband denis and northern ireland 
secretary tom king the cabinet member responible for the province 
she traveled to londonderry the provinces second largest city 
her first stop was at the desmonds shirt factory which earlier 
this year announced a major expansion 
mrs thatchers visit was her second to northern ireland in less 
than a year last november she attended a memorial service in 
enniskillen for 11 people killed when the ira bombed a 
commemoration ceremony for britains war dead

president pw botha 
celebrated 10 years in power today and said he felt fighting 
fit with no plans to retire soon 
botha 72 was elected prime minister on sept 28 1978 that 
post was abolished in 1984 under a new constitution and he became 
president 
in an interview with the staterun radio network botha said 
south africa had great possibilities if its people could unite 
and replace violence with deliberation 
asked to appraise his accomplishments he replied nobody ever 
achieves what he sets out to achieve im satisfied ive made some 
progress 
in the radio interview and an interview published in beeld a 
progovernment newspaper botha said highlights of a decade in 
power included strengthening of the security forces prospects of 
improved relations with other southern african countries efforts 
to bolster the private sector of the economy and reforms that have 
eased some racially discriminatory laws and given blacks a larger 
political role 
among the low points he said were intensive criticism of south 
africa by many western countries and a split in his own afrikaner 
community because of rightwing opposition to his reform program 
asked by the radio interviewer if he was thinking of retiring 
botha said not at this stage im full of vigor 
several newspapers today reported speculation that botha would 
soon make another trip into black africa one possibility is zaire 
where president mobutu sese seko has proposed a regional summit 
meeting to discuss the war in angola and other matters 
two weeks ago botha held his first summit meetings in black 
africa traveling to malawi a longtime friend of south africa and 
mozambique a longtime adversary 
domestically botha has come under mounting criticism in recent 
years both from rightwing whites who feel his reforms are 
excessive and from blacks and white liberals who say they are 
inadequate 
the president advocates increased powersharing with blacks but 
wants the white minority to retain ultimate political control and 
maintain segregated schools and neighborhoods he opposes a 
oneperson onevote system for the black majority 
business day a johannesburg newspaper reflecting the views of 
moderate business executives described botha in an editorial today 
as a flawed leader who had backed away from a chance to push 
the country toward substantive political change 
the citizen a progovernment daily this week praised botha as 
the great reformer 
he may have been tough ruthless unbending at times but he 
also has been powerful steadfast forwardlooking and prepared to 
risk political reverses for the sake of what he believes said an

twentyeight parties have registered for 
israels november elections many of them splinter groups and 
singleissue factions with little hope of winning one of the 120 
seats in parliament 
one group is headed by a diamond polisher who threw a hand 
grenade into parliament in 1957 wounding israeli leaders golda 
meir and david ben gurion 
another party is led by a jerusalem news vendor whose single 
mission is better housing for army veterans 
in each election we have a few strange guys said sarah 
yitzhaki spokeswoman for the parliament or knesset this is the 
price of democracy 
israels electoral system encourages the formation of small 
parties and in the 1984 balloting israels nearly 3 million 
voters had a choice between 26 different parties fifteen won seats 
when registration closed at midnight tuesday 28 parties had 
entered their ranked lists of candidates election officials said 
today seats in parliament are assigned according to the number of 
votes the party wins 
prime minister yitzhak shamirs rightwing likud bloc registered 
its list after a lastminute struggle over the placement of two 
candidates members of the tiny rafiometz group 
earlier this month five likud members asked the supreme court 
to cancel an agreement in which likud promised two safe slots for 
rafiometz to lure them into the fold of the bloc the likud 
members dropped their appeal sunday under pressure from shamir 
in a demonstration of unity rafiometz member zalman shoval on 
tuesday joined the likud delegation presenting the list to the 
central elections committee 
another registrant was moshe duak 54 who was sentenced to 15 
years in prison after throwing a hand grenade into the parliament 
building in 1957 
duak who refused to discuss the incident said his topaz party 
would fight for the rights of sephardim or israelis of north 
african origin 
duak said he walked across the country often sleeping outdoors 
to collect the 1500 signatures needed to register a list 
he pulled a tattered folder containing 2144 signatures out of 
his red backpack and told the committee i dont have a phone 
but you can leave a message at the place where im studying 
parties were also required to pay about 7700 to register 
benzion koren whose movement for the homeland seeks better 
housing for army veterans sold his jerusalem news stand to foot 
the bill israel radio said 
koren ran unsuccessfully twice before he sold his restaurant in 
1981 and his coffee bar in 1984 to enter the race

twentyfive years after the assassination of 
president john f kennedy lee harvey oswalds widow says she now 
believes oswald did not act alone in the killing 
i think he was caught between two powers the government and 
organized crime said maria oswald porter in the november issue 
of ladies home journal published tuesday 
testimony by oswalds widow who married dallas carpenter 
kenneth porter in 1965 helped the warren commission conclude that 
a deranged oswald acted alone in the nov 22 1963 assassination 
when i was questioned by the warren commission i was a blind 
kitten she said 
the commission appointed to investigate the assassination 
concluded it was the work of a single gunman oswald but in 1979 
the house select committee on assassinations relying in part on 
acoustical evidence concluded a conspiracy was likely and that it 
may have involved organized crime 
since then mrs porter 47 has drawn new conclusions 
i dont know if lee shot him she said im not saying 
that lee is innocent that he didnt know about the conspiracy or 
was not a part of it but i am saying hes not necessarily guilty 
of murder 
at first i thought that jack ruby who killed oswald two days 
after the assassination was swayed by passion all of america was 
grieving she said but later we found that he had connections 
with the underworld now i think lee was killed to keep his mouth 
shut 
mrs porter said that in retrospect oswald seemed 
professionally schooled in secretiveness and i believe he worked 
for the american government 
he was taught the russian language when he was in the 
military do you think that is usual that an ordinary soldier is 
taught russian also he got in and out of russia quite easily and 
he got me out quite easily said the russianborn mrs porter 
she had emigrated from the soviet union in 1961 after marrying 
oswald who had defected to the soviets and then changed his mind 
and returned to the united states 
in the months preceding the assassination a man posing as 
oswald reportedly appeared in several public places in the dallas 
area 
i learned afterward that someone who said he was lee had been 
going around looking to buy a car having a drink in a bar im 
telling you lee did not drink and he didnt know how to drive 
and afterward the fbi took me to a store in fort worth where 
lee was supposed to have gone to buy a gun someone even described 
me and said i was with him this woman was wearing a maternity 
outfit like one i had but i had never been there she said 
mrs porter said she hopes the truth will emerge when the warren 
commission materials are declassified 
look im walking through the woods trying to find a path 
just like all of us she said the only difference is i have a 
little bit of insight only half the truth has been told

operations the united states and china have also lent support to

legislation establishing a commission to 
regulate and monitor high stakes gambling on indian reservations 
has gone to the white house following a 32384 house vote that 
completed congressional action on it 
the bill passed by the house tuesday provides for joint 
regulation by the tribes and the federal government of bingo 
lotto and certain card games it would permit casinos and horse 
and dog racing on reservations only if the tribes enter into 
specific contracts with state governments 
indian tribes faced with cutbacks in federal money and a 
limited tax base have instituted gambling operations to raise 
needed revenues bingo is the predominant but not the only form 
of gambling 
the measure would set up three classes of gaming activity two 
of which would be subject to federal regulation or monitoring 
class i defined as traditional ceremonial gaming would be left 
solely to the jurisdiction of the tribes 
class ii bingo lotto and other card games would be 
monitored by a national indian gaming commission to be established 
under the bill card games would be subject to state regulations 
regarding hours of play and betting limits 
class iii would involve all other gambling including casinos 
horse and dog racing and jaialai tribes could engage in class 
iii gambling if they enter into compacts with the state for the 
operation of such games 
the national commission would be composed of five people three 
of whom must be members of federally recognized tribes the 
president would appoint the chairman who would need senate 
confirmation 
the commission would be empowered to close tribal games 
permanently enforce the collection of fines conduct background 
investigations of employees and monitor all indian gaming 
activities 
the measure would authorize 2 million for the first year of the 
commissions operation and require that its operation be financed 
at least 50 percent by the tribes through assessments on gaming 
revenues the remainder would be paid by federal appropriations

the main opposition alliance said today it 
is sending teams around the country to organize grassroots 
opposition to the powerful military autocracy that has ruled burma 
for 26 years 
the announcement was made by the national league for democracy 
which named retired brigadier general aung gyi as its chairman on 
tuesday 
a second opposition group made up of followers of former prime 
minister u nu also has emerged to challenge the government 
stateowned radio rangoon reported tuesday the radio said the 
democracy party was formed with bohmu aung as its patron and thu 
wai as chairman 
bohmu aung was a member of burmas thirty comrades who 
fought for independence from great britain during world war ii thu 
wai was an aide to nu when the ousted prime minister led an 
unsuccessful guerrilla movement against strongman ne win from bases 
along the thaiburmese border in the early 1970s 
two other key prodemocracy leaders former defense minister 
tin oo and aung san suu kyi daughter of burmas main revolutionary 
martyr were named as top officers in national league for 
democracy 
win htein an aide to tin oo said in a telephone interview the 
alliance has started a campaign to organize at the grassroots 
level we have already sent some people to the countryside he 
said 
two teams of 10 people are traveling from town to town toward 
the central city of mandalay to help organize local chapters of the 
league he said 
the alliance will have an uphill battle against the national 
unity party formerly known as the burma socialist program party 
which has been the sole political party since 1962 and has a 
wellestablished amply funded network throughout the country 
western analysts say gen saw maung who seized power in a 
military coup on sept 18 is unquestionably behind the national 
unity party he ordered troops to gun down antigovernment 
demonstrators who for weeks had filled rangoons streets with 
massive protest marches 
saw maung has called for multiparty general elections but has 
set no date 
the government decreed tuesday that rebels foreignaided 
groups the military civil servants and organizations which 
misuse religion will not be allowed to form political parties 
under the law political parties will have to register with the 
government to contest general elections but none has yet done so 
government spokesman kyaw sann announced the official death toll 
since the sept 18 coup rose to 348 people and protesters fleeing 
the crackdown on dissidents claimed soldiers had executed 
demonstrators 
the government previously acknowledged more than 250 deaths but 
has not mentioned executions western diplomats believe troops 
killed up to 400 civilians in the first days after the coup

ptl the evangelical empire founded by 
defrocked preacher jim bakker must find a buyer by oct 14 or face 
the prospect of liquidation says the judge handling its bankruptcy 
case 
on tuesday bankruptcy trustee mc red benton missed the 
latest deadline to present a buyer to judge rufus reynolds saying 
he needed more time to work out complicated legal details of ptls 
sale 
when you get two groups of lawyers analyzing 40some pages of 
contracts you cant always agree on what everything means 
benton told the judge at a hearing thats why its taking so 
long 
reynolds said he understands the process is complicated but 
there has to be a buyer soon 
its got to end sometime he said if you come in here 
with no offer on oct 14 it may go down the drain and it may 
have to be a conversion to a chapter 7 case which means that 
assets would be liquidated 
six weeks ago reynolds had said he would order ptl shut by 
saturday if there was no buyer 
on oct 17 the first business day after the new deadline the 
judge will consider requests from two major ptl creditors fairfax 
savings and loan and arthur anderson amp co for liquidation 
at that time he also will consider a motion to foreclose filed 
by first mortgage investment co of greensboro nc which holds 
the note on about 10 acres of ptl property including the 
television and radio editing facilities 
and he will hear a request from the internal revenue service to 
terminate ptls lease with heritage ministries the nonprofit 
religious arm that was separated from ptl recently the irs argues 
that heritage ministries hasnt been able to meet its rent payments 
were at the end of the road now reynolds said if we 
dont get a sale soon theres not going to be anything for 
anybody 
ptl filed for protection from its creditors under chapter 11 of 
the us bankruptcy code in june 1987 three months after bakker 
admitted a sexual encounter with church secretary jessica hahn and 
resigned 
benton said hes still negotiating with canadian real estate 
executive peter thomas who has offered 113 million for the 
ministrys assets hes also still talking with steven mernick of 
toronto and a group of investors from washington and new york 
called capital management associates 
were after the highest initial cash payment we can get 
benton said declining to elaborate on the offers being considered 
earlier this month bakker had said he had the backing to buy 
ptl for more than other prospective buyers were offering but the 
deal fell through 
also tuesday heritage ministries president don edwards said he 
was resigning that post citing dissension in the organization 
my management style has been teambuilding i cant 
continue in the hostile environment that has built up said

was shaken when she saw the condition of robert stethem after the 
beating 
ms howes said another flight attendant uli derickson helped 
stethem to the back of the plane after the beating 
i was very upset to see him and i used to be a nurse she 
mrs derickson had to hold him by the arm support him so he 
could walk ms howes testified during the murder and air piracy 
trial of mohammed ali hamadi 
i spoke to him stethem one time when we were serving food 
as i handed him the tray the australian girl sitting next to him 
said she would help him with the food ms howes said 
i said to him how are you doing and he just nodded he was 
so badly injured she said

involvement in stethems murder hamadi was arrested at frankfurts 
airport on jan 13 1987 after customs officials discovered liquid

a second terrorist on the airplane 
the second hijacker known to the passengers as said has been 
identified in a us indictiment as hassan ezzeddine 
i believe i was more afraid of said he appeared to be more 
nervous especially with a hand grenade in his hand hamadi

howes said i dont remember no 
other witnesses have testified that hamadi had a gun just before

servicemen in beirut 
asked by chief judge heiner mueckenberger if she had an opinion 
about who killed stethem ms hesp said yes but i did not see 
the shot so it is only my opinion it would be my opinion that it 
would be said who shot 
referring to the beirut bombing ms hesp said ezzeddine told 
her and others on the jet that a friend of his had driven the 
explosivesladen truck onto the us marine compound in beirut in 
october 1983

hates americans and wondered how nonamericans could work for an 
american airline said ms hesp

pennsylvanias high court has canceled 
judicial elections seven weeks before the contests saying the 
state constitution dictates that the elections be held in 
oddnumbered years 
politicians immediately expressed disappointment over tuesdays 
ruling which came after primary races 
it is unfortunate for the voters who have already cast their 
primary ballots and the candidates of both parties who have 
campaigned for many months that these elections will not be held 
this year said morey m myers general counsel to democrat gov 
robert p casey 
republican state chairman earl baker said he had hoped the court 
would have allowed the campaign to go forward because candidates 
had been selected in the primary 
four candidates who had won primary victories for respective 
spots on the supreme and superior court found months of campaigning 
undone 
acting on a suit by attorney richard sprague the state supreme 
court issued the fivesentence decision saying the constitution 
calls for statewide judicial elections be held apart from other 
political races 
sprague said he learned about the issue after reading an article 
by duquesne university law school professor bruce ledweitz 
i knew that if it wasnt challenged now it would be challenged 
by the first litigant who lost a case before the supreme court in 
january ledweitz said tuesday 
six years ago the court acting on a superior court judges 
request permitted a supreme court election in an evennumbered 
year along with other political contests 
caseys administration said it had based its decision to hold 
the election on the 1982 decision which said statewide judicial 
elections could be scheduled as circumstances require despite 
separate language calling for them only in oddnumbered years 
one superior court candidate walter cohen former state welfare 
secretary said he was disappointed a little discouraged but not 
surprised 
the biggest losers are the voters who will be without a fully 
elected supreme court for another year said mark keisling a 
spokesman for another candidate former us rep allen ertel who 
was running for the supreme court

testimony has ended in a lawsuit 
charging that charleston county schools are unconstitutionally 
segregated but it will be spring at the earliest before a decision 
is announced 
the lawsuit which was filed in january 1981 and went to trial 
last october alleges that the 1967 consolidation of county schools 
fostered racial segregation 
the consolidation created a countywide school board to oversee 
the operations of eight existing local school districts but the 
consolidation left faculty and student assignments in control of 
the local district boards 
fiftyfive percent of the countys 43512 students are black 
and more than a third of them attend classes in schools that are 
more than 90 percent black 
the plaintiffs the justice department and the naacp legal 
defense and education fund are asking us district judge sol 
blatt jr to abolish the local district lines and order better 
racial mixing of the districts students 
the case went to trial last october and since then 80 
witnesses have appeared in 34 days of testimony spread over 11 
months the last witnesses testified tuesday 
blatt who is hearing the case without a jury will receive 
final briefs from attorneys for both sides by late winter no oral 
arguments are planned 
also tuesday the judge ruled against a school district motion 
seeking release of a 1980 memo written by the justice department 
attorney who recommended filing the case 
the district felt the memo which was believed to outline 
arguments both for and against filing suit could contain 
admissions damaging to the governments case 
portions of the memo appeared in a 1983 newspaper article and 
school district attorneys argued that since it appeared in the 
press it was no longer confidential as the justice department 
maintained 
but blatt said simply because a former employee disclosed the 
information it didnt mean the government waived its right that it 
was privileged 
he added i dont think this report contains any information 
that is of a dire need to the school district 
during the trial the school district presented testimony that 
the consolidation was a financial tool that allowed poorer rural 
districts to tap the countywide tax base 
some schools were in abysmal shape when the district was 
consolidated and many failed to meet state standards billie 
holladay who served as director of elementary instruction in the 
county from 1968 through 1985 testified tuesday 
in one school 30 elementary students were taught in a trailer 
without air conditioning in another there were no instructional 
materials for a special education class she recalled

lloyd bentsen told students at harry 
truman high school today that im ready to lead the nation as 
truman did if something should happen to the president 
the same cannot be said for republican dan quayle suggested 
bentsen the democratic vice presidential candidate and he also 
criticized republican george bush for choosing quayle as his 
running mate and for not being a stronger vice president himself 
i think anyone who runs for vice president must earn the 
respect of the american people bentsen told the students in the 
late presidents hometown and he must enjoy the trust and 
respect of his running mate 
if a presidential candidate does not choose a running mate 
with those qualifications he does not respect the importance and 
dignity of the office of vice president said bentsen who will 
debate quayle next wednesday night in omaha neb 
bentsen the texas senator recalled that vice president truman 
became president truman in 1945 when franklin delano roosevelt died 
harry truman was ready because he was smart enough 
courageous enough and loaded with the integrity necessary to lead 
the forces of the free world he was up to the job bentsen said 
like harry truman im ready he said ready to run and 
serve with mike dukakis ready to help lead america to a new era of 
greatness and if anything should happen to mike if a tragedy 
should occur im ready to lead america 
bentsens job on the stump generally has been to tout dukakis 
and attend events that complement those of the presidential 
nominee but with polls showing voter unease with bushs choice of 
quayle the campaign decided to use the visit to trumans 
birthplace to step up its attack on bushs judgment in choosing 
quayle and on the indiana senators qualifications for the vice 
presidency 
bentsen without mentioning the 41yearold quayle by name 
discussed his own experience noting that he met truman during 
bentsens first term in congress to suggest the republican was 
not up to the job 
just as we expect a president to be qualified for office and 
to be ready to lead america so must we expect the same of those 
who might like harry truman become president at a moments 
notice the 67yearold bentsen said 
bentsen also likened dukakis to truman telling the students 
that during sunday nights debate with bush they saw a democrat 
in the tradition of harry truman proud of his family and proud of 
his country talking to the people about housing and health care 
and national defense 
and in a swipe at bush bentsen praised dukakis for wanting an 
activist vice president not always in agreement with the president 
and willing to stand up for his actions 
he does not want his vice president to ever hide behind a lame 
excuse that he wasnt in the loop a phrase bush has used when 
saying he was not fully aware of armsforhostages dealing with 
iran 
on tuesday in kansas city bentsen lashed out at republican 
trade and budget policies and invited democrats who supported 
president reagan to come home to the party that cares 
at a rally at the kansas city airport he chided quayle for 
opposing legislation to give workers 60 days notice before they 
are laid off and accused the reagan administration of sitting idly 
by as america lost its dominance in the world marketplace 
theyve watched us exporting jobs instead of american 
products said bentsen who suggested that a george bush 
presidency would bring lax enforcement of the new trade law 
designed to open up foreign markets to us products 
one of the messages we send out is democrats come home 
bentsen said come home to the democratic party come home to the 
party that cares 
at his airport rally bentsen declared that dan quayle lost 
the fight against plant closing and the american people won 
he also delighted the crowd of about 250 people by saying 
were going to open the quayle season a little early this year 
earlier at a news conference in detroit bentsen predicted 
quayle would be a formidable debate opponent i think dan quayle 
is going to do very well in the debate bentsen said im not 
so confrontational 
quayle ventured into bentsens home state of texas on tuesday 
but the democrat said he wasnt worried 
i have great faith in the judgment of the people of texas 
the senator said with a smile

a crisis hot line for youngsters 
that won a presidential award last year is receiving fewer calls 
and faces a loss of funds because of confusion with costly party 
lines its founder says 
lorraine la susaweymouth who started kids line in this chicago 
suburb three years ago said her service was running smoothly until 
june 1987 when the party lines some call themselves hot 
lines became popular 
the 24hour crisis line for troubled youths is run by 
volunteers and the only cost is the price of a regular phone call 
the forprofit party lines allow kids to chat with several peers 
at once young callers have frequently racked up huge phone bills 
and created an uproar among parents 
many prevented their children from calling any hot line and 
operators who get calls from youths seeking the crisis line number 
often mistakenly give them the number of a party line said state 
sen william mahar who has joined efforts to clear up the 
confusion 
ms la susaweymouth said at one time kids line was receiving 
1800 calls a month but that number has since dropped to 400 a 
month she said the confusion threatens crisis lines nationwide 
children will call us even if they are suicidal and say 
does this cost she said 
in one instance a teenage boy who asked the operator for the 
number of teen line an adjunct to kids line for teens was 
mistakenly referred to a party line she said it was not until he 
had started discussing his problem that the boy realized his 
mistake 
he was just absolutely unhinged because his peer group on the 
party line made fun of him she said 
the service received a presidents volunteer action award in 
public safety ms la susaweymouth said 
kids are being told that were a friend they can talk to with 
their problems she said it would be a shame if we werent 
there to listen 
mahar said he has been meeting with the citizens utility board 
and illinois bell to try and iron out the confusion he said 
announcements on radio and television also are planned

southern shalamcheh sector after he was wounded in the eyes during 
a major iranian offensive against the port city of basra 
i refused and they left me without treatment i lost both 
eyes said namou an agronomist who was serving as an enlisted 
man 
the iraqis were the first prisoners released by iran since an 
aug 20 ceasefire in the 8yearold persian gulf war a fullscale 
prisoner exchange provided for under the united nationssponsored 
ceasefire agreement has been stalled because peace talks are 
deadlocked

50182 pows held by iran and 19284 by iraq 
diplomats in baghdad and tehran however believe that iran 
holds 60000 to 70000 prisoners and iraq 30000 to 50000 
the freed iraqis showed reporters injuries and scars they said 
they suffered at the hands of iranian guards in pow camps 
ministry officials said all 72 men freed last week were disabled 
soldiers handed over at the border 
namou said christian prisoners were isolated from iraqi moslem 
pows by their guards who considered them to be unclean 
many of the christian soldiers were forced to convert to islam 
under psychological pressure and torture he said 
there are an estimated 250000 christians among iraqs 16 
million moslems 
the former prisoners said that after the ceasefire was 
announced iranian pressure on them to seek asylum in iran 
intensified

country said ali hussein salman 26 who said he was captured in 
the tiab area east of the southern iraqi city of amara in 1982

pilgrims were killed in rioting in the holy city of mecca in saudi 
arabia 
more than 400 people 275 of them iranians were killed july 31 
1987 in the violence the saudis said was instigated by militant 
iranian fundamentalists in defiance of a ban on political protests 
during the annual hajj pilgrimage 
salman said his iranian guards at the takhti pow camp near 
tehran injured his skull paralyzing one side of his face and body 
when the news broke that some iranians had been killed in

moslems

about 30 members of the temple mount faithful a group that demands 
jewish control over the area known in arabic as haram elsharif

the occupied territories including a 10yearold boy who was shot 
in the head while playing on the roof of his home hospital

thousands of jewish pilgrims some singing and dancing prayed 
below temple mount at the western wall the last remnant of the 
temple to commemorate the harvest holiday of sukkot

where the prophet mohammed ascended to heaven in the 7th century 
the mount dominated by the golden dome of the rock and al aqsa 
mosques is administered by the moslem waqf a religious 
institution responsible for the care of islamic holy sites

israels 21year occupation of the west bank and gaza strip since 
the uprising began in december 278 palestinians and six israelis 
have been killed

a us attorney says a serious inquiry is 
needed into the ethics of lawyers representing a black teenager 
who a grand jury reportedly determined lied about being abducted 
and raped by whites 
the case of tawana brawley led to an intensive investigation and 
charges of a racially motivated coverup 
i think the way in which this case developed and the way in 
which people acted is something that should be a matter of concern 
for the legal profession it should be a matter of concern for the 
state said us attorney rudolph giuliani 
its certainly worth a serious inquiry he told reporters 
tuesday 
but the prosecutor steered clear of criticizing either alton h 
maddox jr or c vernon mason the brawley familys legal advisers 
im not going to single out any individuals and im not going 
to suggest that anybody did anything wrong he said 
the state grand jury investigating the case has developed 
overwhelming evidence that miss brawley fabricated the story 
the new york times reported tuesday 
miss brawley now 16 and her mother glenda refused to testify 
before the grand jury a contempt citation was lodged against mrs 
brawley but she avoided arrest and prosecution by living in a 
church mrs brawley her boyfriend and her daughter have left the 
state 
maddox mason and the rev al sharpton another brawley adviser 
accused state and local officials of a coverup without providing 
evidence to back up the claim 
the brawley family reportedly was seen leaving their home in 
virginia beach va early tuesday in a van loaded with suitcases 
for an unknown destination 
sharpton said miss brawley her mother and the attorneys would 
respond to the report within 24 hours a news conference scheduled 
for this morning was postponed until later in the day 
on tuesday sharpton called the times article nothing but a 
whole series of reckless speculations by someone who cannot back it 
up with one iota of fact 
as in the past the black activist charged that the criminal 
justice system does not treat minorities fairly 
tawana is only the last race case that a grand jury has 
suggested was a fantasy sharpton told reporters 
state attorney general robert abrams whose office presented the 
case to the grand jury said in a statement he would not confirm 
or deny the accuracy of any aspect of the times story 
giulianis office entered the case when samuel mcclease of 
jersey city nj claimed to have tapes of brawley advisers 
expressing doubts about her story 
the tapes never surfaced mcclease was charged with obstructing 
justice and brawley advisers accused giuliani of hiring him to 
secretly tape their conversations 
the times said the grand jury decided not to indict anyone and 
by law cannot criticize ordinary citizens that it does not indict 
miss brawley was found nov 28 outside an apartment complex in 
which the family once lived in wappingers falls 75 miles north of 
new york she was inside a garbage bag smeared with dog feces 
seemingly dazed and with racial slurs written on her body 
the times said the grand jury found plenty of evidence to show 
she was not abducted on nov 24 as she claimed the panel instead 
determined she stayed in the nearby apartment where her family had 
lived 
it said she possibly with an accomplice smeared herself with 
the feces wrote the racial slurs tore and scorched her clothes 
and crawled into the bag and pretended to be in a traumatized daze 
according to the newspaper 
it said that for weeks she misled doctors social workers 
police reporters and others with medical complaints and false and 
fragmentary accounts of her fabricated episode 
the grand jury speculated that her motivation may have been fear 
of punishment from her mothers boyfriend for her late nights out 
and that drugs and her relationships with shady characters may have 
played a role the times said 
the grand jury report is expected to be released within weeks 
the times said

czechoslovakia has ordered two 
british military attaches out of the country for activities 
incompatible with their diplomatic status the official news 
agency ctk reported today 
the expulsions came six days after britain accused three 
czechoslovak diplomats including two military attaches of spying 
and gave them two weeks to leave pragues embassy in london 
ctk named the two britons ordered out of prague as wing 
commander john maynard and warrant officer graeme addy 
british diplomat richard todd said both men have been at the 
prague embassy since the summer of 1986 and were given 14 days to 
leave the country 
british charge daffaires john macgregor was summoned to the 
czechoslovak foreign ministry today and informed of the decision to 
expel the two men for activity incompatible with their diplomatic 
status ctk said 
that phrase is commonly used in diplomatic parlance to describe 
activities viewed as espionage 
on sept 22 britain expelled czechoslovakias assistant 
military attache maj bedrich kramar air attache maj vlastimil 
netolicky and pavel moudry a member of the commercial section 
the british foreign office said the expulsions were a signal 
that while britain seeks better relations with czechoslovakia it 
will not tolerate the sort of activities in which pragues 
three diplomats engaged 
in relaying word of czechoslovakias expulsions ctk used almost 
identical language 
the czechoslovak side told britain the activities of the two 
britons contradicted the interest in constructive relations 
between czechoslovakia and britain and is an obstacle to their 
further development ctk said 
in london a foreign office spokesman denied the expelled 
britons were spies he said the move was definitely a 
retaliation for britain ordering the expulsion of three 
czechosolvak envoys on sept 22 
we have said we want to develop relations with czechoslovakia 
but the action of the three diplomats in london didnt help and 
this does not help either the spokesman told the associated 
press 
they the czechoslovakian authorities gave us the usual thing 
that these men were involved in the gathering of information of an 
intelligence nature said the spokesman who spoke on condition 
of anonymity

defense motions unsealed today in the case of 
panamas military ruler gen manuel antonio noriega charge that his 
indictment on drug charges was part of a scheme to renegotiate the 
panama canal treaty 
that treaty signed during the carter administration turns over 
control of the canal to panama at the end of this century 
there were attempts to modify aspects of the treaty 
noriegas attorney neal sonnett said today we argue that it 
was one of the circumstances leading up to a decision to attempt to 
get noriega out of power 
the 65page motion requesting dismissal of the indictment 
accuses the government of selective prosecution and questions its 
authority to to indict the head of a sovereign nation 
the document dated sept 14 had initially been ordered sealed 
by us district judge william hoeveler at the request of 
prosecutors 
at the time chief deputy us attorney richard gregorie said he 
feared the motions might contain information that could be used to 
influence the us presidential election 
noriega has claimed previously he has information that would 
hurt george bushs electoral chances 
but gregorie said today after reviewing the motions he had 
found nothing shocking in them and had himself moved to unseal 
the document he said he would respond next month to the dismissal

rescue workers today recovered a third 
body from a sixstory apartment building that collapsed in 
monterrey and continued to search for three other people believed 
trapped in tons of rubble 
the rescuers aided by dogs located the body of a woman soon 
after the building collapsed on tuesday the body of a man and an 
infant were found 
the search continued for two women and a 19monthold baby 
believed trapped when the building collapsed and part of it fell 
down a steep hillside 
authorities said hurricane gilbert may have been partly 
responsible for the collapse of the 3yearold cement building 
state prosecutor alejandro garza said four people were rescued 
after the collapse 
rescue teams dug by hand and carried out buckets of broken 
concrete that had been the buildings walls and floors 
the goal is to preserve the life of those that may be 
inside worker trevino berchelman said he said three teams of 
dogs brought in to sniff through the rubble all pinpointed the same 
area where the victims may be trapped but that concrete slabs 
prevented rescue workers from searching there 
salinas garcia who was in his secondfloor apartment when the 
building collapsed said he didnt realize what was happening at 
first i woke up and the roof was on top of me he said his 
face and tshirt covered with blood 
francisco javier nakashima a local police investigator said 
heavy rains from gilbert which struck this northern industrial 
city sept 17 must have contributed to the collapse however he 
said neighbors also reported the structure was leaning to one side 
six months ago 
gilbert caused widespread flooding killing at least 140 local 
people most of whom died in buses that were overturned by flood 
waters 
garza identified the dead man as antonio rodriguez 25 to 30 
years old and said he did not know the name of the dead infant 
who was less than 1 year old 
hospital officials said two of the four people who were rescued 
were treated for minor injuries and released from a local hospital

republican george bush today defended 
his proposal for a taxdeferred savings plan while saying a college 
loan program advanced by michael dukakis would put the irs on 
your tail for the rest of your life 
bush made the comments at illinois state university as he began 
a 150mile campaign swing through rural central and northern 
illinois riding in the refurbished campaign bus that had been used 
by onetime rival pat robertson 
he told a spirited college rally that illinois was vital to 
the election and that he planned to be in the state again and 
again his visit followed by one day a dukakis campaign swing 
through illinois which holds 24 electoral votes and is viewed as 
critical by both sides 
although dukakis has scorned bushs new plan for taxdeferred 
savings claiming it will save americans no more than 20 a year 
bush insisted his dayold proposal would give taxpayers a little 
nest egg 
he slashed at dukakis plan for college loans that would be paid 
back according to an individuals future earnings through tax 
withdrawals 
we do not need to put the irs on your tail for the rest of 
your life bush said under his approach the government would 
give you a loan then take a bit out of your paycheck for the next 
40 years 
he wants to spend more and i want to put more money in the 
hands of individuals not in the hands of government bush said 
traveling with bush were country singers loretta lynn and her 
sisters crystal gayle and peggy sue wright bush has been behind 
the president watching every move he makes were ready for him 
miss lynn said 
bush also ridiculed dukakis for driving a tank during a recent 
campaign stop i know what it is doing dumb things but the one 
that takes the cake is him riding around in that tank bush said 
dont tell me he doesnt have a sense of humor 
later bush chatted with patrons in a small restaurant and 
bowling alley in el paso ill and also planned brief rallies and 
stops in six other small illinois communities 
bushs taxdeferred savings plan which he calls an individual 
savings account would allow low and middleincome savers to 
defray paying taxes on interest income on savings of up to 1000 a 
year so long as the money was kept in such accounts for five or 
more years 
the vice president unveiling the plan in a speech tuesday to 
the ohio republican convention said it would help americans be 
better able to afford a home pay for college or start a 
business 
americans have increasingly gotten away from the sensible 
frugality that says put some away for a rainy day bush said 
but bush advisers suggested afterward the plan was far less 
ambitious 
the idea was designed to encourage people to put money into a 
savings account thats all said craig fuller bushs chief of 
staff its an incentive a little incentive 
michael boskin a top bush economic adviser and coarchitect of 
the proposal says it would only yield about 14 a year in tax 
savings for the maximum deposit 
but the stanford university economist added this will be an 
important additional incentive for savings 
dukakis was quick to attack the proposal 
twenty bucks a year thats mr bushs solution for average 
americans dukakis said referring to his calculations he says 
it will make them and here im quoting better able to afford a 
home pay for college start a business twenty bucks a year 
whos he kidding

the sun bremerton wash on abortion 
supreme court associate justice harry blackmun author of the 
1973 roe v wade decision that legalized abortion nationwide now 
is warning the decision may not last another high court session 
talking in the circumspect language implicitly required of high 
court justices blackmun hinted in a law school speech that 
reagan appointments especially that of associate justice anthony 
kennedy may end roe v wade 
blackmun is doing one of at least two things he actually may be 
warning that with the appointment of kennedy antonin scalia and 
sandra day oconnor roe v wades days are numbered and so is 
abortion on demand in the united states at least for some women 
in some states 
or hes implicitly urging the presidential candidates to bring 
the issue to the fore so freedom of choice backers can vote 
for gov michael s dukakis vice president george bush opposes 
abortion 
or hes hinting that he soon may resign from the court and the 
senate can allow a righttolife majority to slip in if it 
isnt careful 
the nation may be continuing its move to the right enough to 
restrict what was basically a 1960s abortion decision but neither 
is congress ready to make all abortions out of reach for all women 
blackmun correctly sees the nation turning a corner on the 
issue but thats not the same thing as reversing ones course

the columbus ind republic on air pollution 
those hazy days of summer are behind us too bad the same cant 
be said for air pollution 
according to a report acid rain has landed in our own 
backyard no longer can we smugly dismiss it as someone elses 
problem 
acid rain occurs when sulfur dioxide emitted by the tall stacks 
of power plants and factories mixes with moisture in the 
atmosphere the six states bordering the ohio river account for 
almost 40 percent of this countrys sulfur dioxide pollution 
but prevailing winds were thought to carry the pollutants north 
to canada and east toward new england 
industry particularly midwestern power companies has long 
maintained that the costs of additional antipollution 
equipment will drive up consumer costs while making it less 
competitive 
those arguments sounded convincing enough when midwesterners 
thought they had little to worry about now theres another price 
to pay

the duluth minn newstribune on the state of education in the 
united states 
do we as a nation have to worry about scientific illiteracy as 
we march into the 21st century 
the us department of education reported last week that 
american young people continue to perform poorly on science 
proficiency both in comparison with their counterparts in other 
nations and in comparison with us school students two decades ago 
the study found that only 7 percent of the nations 17yearolds 
have enough scientific knowledge to do well in college science 
courses and that more than half of americans of that age are so 
illeducated in science that they cannot perform jobs requiring 
technical skills or benefit from special job training 
but perhaps more alarming than that the study found that 
science proficiency for black and hispanic students aged 13 to 17 
is at least four years behind the levels of white students of the 
same ages and that a considerable difference in science exists 
between males and females of that age group 
one thing is clear all is not well with education in america

the saginaw mich news on us support of the united nations 
president reagans decision to pay the united nations 532 
million in back support represents a change of heart according 
to the washington post 
were not so sure our hunch is that the president planned all 
along to eventually pay the cash but he wanted to make a point 
about bloated spending among bureaucrats and us bashing in the 
general assembly 
reagan was right to cut off the money and he was right if 
somewhat belatedly to pay it back 
the united nations still pays salaries that are too fat and 
consulting fees that are too generous but reins have been applied 
reagans spotlight stemmed some of the financial abuse 
meanwhile the united states is gaining more respect within the 
united nations and the united nations is taking more steps that 
favor western interests tentative agreements respecting 
afghanistan southwest africa the iraniraq war and the 
turkishgreek division of cyprus are recent examples 
reagan did what needed to be done as a result the united

called a covert cia operation fomenting demonstrations against the

wright denies that he arrived at his conclusions from secret

wright and some of his congressional colleagues like to jump on 
the administration for not keeping congress properly informed

north jersey advance flanders nj on higher immigration 
quotas 
in a surprising development the reagan administration 
proposed a sharp increase in admission quotas for the next fiscal 
year it wants to admit 94000 refugees from around the world 
compared to its request last year of a limit of 72500 
the dramatic increase proposed is a laudable response to both 
humane appeals and practical foreign affairs concerns 
the thais and other southeast asian governments hardpressed 
financially with their upkeep of vietnamese refugees implore the 
united states to let more of those emigrate to this country 
and the united states has a special obligation in this regard 
because that flood of boat people stems in some degree from a 
failure of us policy in vietnam 
the administration has suppressed its budgetary concerns to 
advocate this enlargement of the nations welcome mat and congress 
should not hesitate to vote the additional funds that will be 
needed

democratic presidential nominee michael 
dukakis said today that as president he would sign an executive 
order barring top administration officials from lobbying the 
government if they leave their federal posts 
he strongly criticized the reagan administrations conduct 
trying to turn the issue against his republican opponent 
george bush may be satisfied with this administrations hall 
of shame dozens of top administration officials who broke the 
law and violated the public trust he may be satisfied with letting 
japan make the cars while his former colleagues make the license 
plates i say america can do better than that dukakis said 
george bush may be satisfied with the revolving door between 
the administration and private lobbying firms where selfservice 
replaces public service and dishonest consultants are ripping off 
the pentagon i say we can do better than that he said 
high government office is a public trust not a training camp 
for foreign lobbyists or a vehicle for private gain he told a 
rally in pennsylvania the executive order would prevent top 
officials from lobbying for the duration of a dukakis 
administration 
dukakis said he also would issue a second executive order 
curbing agency and department contact with former members of 
congress for some period of time 
the massachusetts governor said he would close what he called 
the deaver loophole a reference to reagan administration 
officials who left the white house and began lobbying their former 
executive office colleagues top reagan aide michael deaver was 
convicted of perjury for lying about his contacts with 
administration officials on behalf of corporations who paid him 
huge fees for his services 
dukakis has often criticized the reagan administration for lax 
ethical standards but this was his first specific proposal to deal 
with it 
his proposal to limit agency contact with former members of 
congress would be certain to cause controversy on capitol hill 
many former members of congress have joined washington law firms 
and receive large retainers for lobbying their former colleagues as 
well as executivebranch agencies 
dukakis said his executive order which he would sign the day 
i take office would cover all presidential appointees confirmed 
by the senate and all senior white house staff a total of about 
800 people 
current law prohibits government officials from lobbying the 
agencies or offices in which they work for one year after leaving 
government service dukakis would broaden that and expand the time 
period to the duration of his administration 
dukakis lost no time tuesday attacking a george bush proposal to 
allow low and middleincome americans to contribute up to 1000 a 
year to taxdeferred savings accounts 
twenty bucks a year dukakis said slowly his tone leaving 
no doubt what he thought of bushs plan to help middle class 
americans 
twenty bucks a year he repeated whos he kidding 
dukakis was also traveling to new york city today for a meeting 
with soviet foreign minister eduard shevardnadze 
dukakis aide jim steinberg said the meeting was arranged before 
the recent session between shevardnadze and bush during which the 
soviet official praised the vice president for his role in recent 
improvement in ussoviet relations 
steinberg said there was no set agenda for the meeting but that 
it would cover the whole range of ussoviet concerns 
he said the meeting would give the two a chance to meet each 
other and discuss common interests and concerns and to understand 
better their respective approaches to ussoviet relations and 
issues that affect both countries 
steinberg said the governor looks forward to substantive 
discussions with shevardnadze at the same time hes going to make 
clear that hes not the president of the united states 
dukakis also had a meeting with french president francois 
mitterand scheduled for thursday morning 
a number of foreign leaders were in new york for the opening of 
the united nations general assembly session 
outlining his plan for an individual savings account bush 
said it would allow taxpayers to put something away for a rainy 
day a bush aide said the plan would enable small savers to defer 
paying taxes on interest income on savings of up to 1000 a year 
as long as the money is kept in such accounts for five or more 
years 
the campaign said the plan which would be available to those 
with adjusted gross incomes up to 50000 would only yield about 
14 a year in tax savings for the maximum deposit dukakis aides 
calculated it would add up to a 20 benefit 
twenty bucks a year thats mr bushs solution for average 
americans said dukakis 
he says it will make and here im quoting him americans 
better able to afford a home pay for college or start a 
business dukakis said 
the democratic nominee juxtaposed bushs support for a cut in 
the capital gains tax with the gop nominees savings plan 
today after i pointed that out to him on sunday night he 
discovered the rest of america and he told just what his priorities 
are dukakis said he wants to give the wealthiest 1 percent of 
americans 30000 and the rest of us are going to get 20 bucks

president reagan today signed legislation 
implementing the uscanadian free trade agreement saying it will 
mean lower prices for consumers and many new jobs for workers 
the senate approved the bill on sept 19 by a vote of 830 with 
the presidents signature it clears the way for us action in 
phasing out tariffs on 131 billion in merchandise that crosses the 
uscanada border each year 
the agreement was approved this year by the canadian house of 
commons but leaders of the the canadian senate have said they will 
delay action until prime minister brian mulroney holds an election 
there is speculation in canada that mulroney will call an election 
shortly for late november he is four years into his term 
mulroney a progressive conservative is a strong supporter of 
the agreement but both opposition parties the liberals and the 
new democrats oppose it public opinion polls show that opinion in 
canada is about evenly divided on the issue 
reagan signed the bill in a rose garden ceremony saying this 
is a moment future historians will cite as a landmark a turning 
point in the forward march of trade commerce and even civilization 
itself 
thats a dramatic statement i know he said but the 
agreement creates the worlds largest free trade area and 
will mean lower prices for consumers jobs galore for workers and 
new markets for producers 
the bill calls for a 10year phaseout of tariffs and a number 
of other trade curbs under the pact signed in january by the 
president and the canadian prime minister 
the freetrade zone would remove barriers between the north 
american neighbors but the two countries would continue to have 
separate sets of tariffs and quotas on imports from third countries 
israel is the only country that now has a freetrade agreement 
with the united states its volume is small compared with the 131 
billion a year in goods that make canada this countrys top trading 
partner

a group representing the nations hog farmers 
said wednesday it once again will seek import duties on pork 
products from canada claiming that the canadian meat is subsidized 
and competes unfairly with american producers 
ray hankes president of the national pork producers council 
said a petition asking for the countervailing duty on canadian meat 
will be filed with the commerce department and the us 
international trade commission 
the announcment was made at a news conference during a threeday 
legislative meeting of the council in washington hankes said the 
council also would seek financial support from the meatpacking 
industry 
a countervailing duty on canadian hogs was obtained in 1985 a 
move that was upheld by the us court of international trade 
during a lengthy appeals process that import duty remains in 
effect 
but the pork producers also sought to include canadian pork 
products in the 1985 case contending that producers and meat 
packers were part of the same industry and are linked through a 
continuous line of production 
the commerce department ruled in 1985 that subsidies being paid 
to canadian hog farmers justified us duties on imports of pork 
products but the us court of international trade acting on an 
appeal by the canadian meat council overruled the commerce 
decision 
hankes said the council was successful in including an amendment 
in the recent trade law that in effect overturns the earlier 
court decision and reinstates the commerce departments authority 
to impose duties on processed pork to the full extent of subsidy 
payments made to canadian hog producers 
in 1985 the pork council predicted that if a countervailing 
duty was imposed on canadian hogs but not on pork products the 
canadians would simply slaughter more hogs and send the products 
into the united states 
that in fact has occurred the council said in 1984 
imports of pork products from canada equaled 345 million pounds by 
the end of the current year estimpated pork product imports to the 
us from canada will total 526 million pounds thats a 52 percent 
increase since the councils original petition was filed 
further the council said imports of subsidized pork are 
capturing a growing percentage of the us market and seriously 
depressing us hog prices 
the council cited a study by university of missouri economist 
glenn grimes showing that imports of pork products from canada 
depressed us hog prices as much as 381 per hundredweight 
during the first six months of this year 
council officials added that means us pork producers 
suffered a potential revenue loss of as much as 393 million in the 
first half of 1988 as a result of subsidized canadian pork imports 
gross revenue losses to us meat packers are even higher 
the council said it does not seek to inhibit free trade and 
competition between canada and the united states but does want 
to ensure that all producers and packers domestic and foreign 
operate under the same market conditions undistorted by government 
financial intervention

failure by israel to act quickly on an 
international ruling about an occupied border area claimed by egypt 
could threaten the two countries peace treaty a foreign ministry 
source said today 
an arbitration agreement signed on sept 11 1986 commits egypt 
and israel to carry out the ruling due thursday from a panel in 
geneva switzerland 
if as expected the ruling is in cairos favor it would 
require israel to surrender the taba border enclave near elat 
israel which the jewish state has held since the 1967 middle east 
war the dispute over the 250acre beachfront area has been a key 
sticking point in egyptianisraeli relations the two countries 
signed a usmediated peace treaty in 1979 
any delays from the israeli side in implementing the ruling 
will affect the surviving peace between egypt and israel said 
the source who spoke on condition of anonymity 
however the spokesman for traveling foreign minister esmat 
abdelmeguid said neither the ministry nor anybody else in the 
egyptian government would have anything to say about taba before 
the panels decision is announced 
in jerusalem an official of the israeli foreign ministry said 
israel has no intention to get around the ruling or go beyond 
the deadline he noted the agreement setting up the panel allows 
51 days to carry out the ruling we have said we will obey 
according to the letter and the spirit of the arbitration he 
said speaking on condition of anonymity 
on tuesday radio israel and other israeli media reports said 
the arbiters have decided against israel 
the ruling on taba has to be carried out by egypt and 
israel the egyptian foreign ministry source said the carrying 
out of the ruling does not need negotiations but there will be 
negotiations about the civilian procedures to settle the position 
of the israeli structures in the area 
after israel took over the barren beach israeli entrepreneurs 
established a modern hotel and a beach cabana on it the reference 
in the egyptian statement was to possible compensation for the 
facilities and rules governing israeli visits to taba 
israel refused to hand over taba when it withdrew in 1982 from 
the sinai peninsula under stipulations of the 1979 accord israels 
only treaty with an arab state

but the four major british bookmakers already had paid out by the 
time the results were announced 
that means that bettors who backed american 49 favorite carl 
lewis who was given the gold after johnsons disqualification 
will not receive anything 
mike dillon a spokesman for ladbrokes compared the event with 
a horse race 
once a man is given his medal that is akin to a horse being 
weighed in johnsons disqualification came after the weigh in 
and therefore we are settling bets on first past the post 
dillon said

the national academy of engineering announced 
wednesday the establishment of a major new international award for 
achievement in engineering and technology that it hopes will match 
the prestige of the nobel prizes 
this award is designed to focus worldwide attention on the 
critical role that engineering and technology play in improving the 
quality of everyday life robert m white the academys 
president said in announcing the award named after aeronautical 
engineer charles stark draper 
draper developed the theory and invented the technology of 
inertial guidance systems now universally used in aircraft 
submarines missiles and space vehicles 
white noted that our society tends to reward the discoverer of 
basic scientific principle but overlook the engineer who puts that 
principle into practice in products and services that yield 
societal and economic benefits 
we hope that in years to come the charles stark draper prize 
will be just as wellknown and respected an award in engineering as 
the nobel prizes are today for chemistry physics and medicine 
he said 
according to white the recipient of the first draper prize 
consisting of a gold medal and 350000 in prize money will be 
announced in october 1989 the award subsequently will be given 
every two years 
endowed by mits charles stark draper laboratory of cambridge 
mass the prize recognizes engineering and technology achievements 
contributing to the advancement of human welfare and freedom 
announcement of the award came as the national academy of 
engineering a sister organization of the national academy of 
sciences held its 24th annual meeting 
in a speech to the meeting white called for efforts by the 
government to develop a more coherent vigorous technology policy 
as a consensus emerges on the need for the federal government 
to participate in the support of the nations civil technology base 
there is no recognizable or effective governmental mechanism for 
doing so he said whereas we have a reasonably welldefined 
science structure in the federal government for support of 
scientific research a technology structure is nonexistent 
we neglect support for engineering and technology at our 
peril white said we have a science policy but no technology 
policy 
also addressing the session was mit president paul e gray who 
called for renewed development of nuclear power as a way of coping 
with the greenhouse effect global warming largely caused by the 
burning of fossil fuels 
we must make an earnest and sustained effort to educate the 
public about the risks and benefits of nuclear power in terms that 
permit quantitative comparison with other energy sources he said 
in addition to achieving a solution to the problem of nuclear 
waste disposal gray said we must develop build and test 
radically different reactor designs that pose entirely negligible 
risks of the accidental release of radioactive materials as a 
result of overheating

radical students demanding the release 
of a jailed student leader fought riot police with clubs and 
firebombs wednesday and threatened to stage violent protests during 
the closing days of the olympics 
the radicals have been able to mount just a few minor protests 
during the games and authorities said they could stop any attempt 
to disrupt events 
student leaders issued their warning after about 200 radicals 
battled police at korea university to demand the release of oh 
youngshik 
students pelted riot troopers with dozens of firebombs and some 
attacked with wooden clubs during the brief clash troopers fended 
off the blows with shields but some officers were hit by firebombs 
and their clothes were set ablaze 
why are the olympics being staged when democratic figures are 
behind bars students chanted release imprisoned students 
police in combat fatigues and visored helmets made several 
charges to push protesters back and hurled a few tear gas grenades 
the fighting was confined to the street in front of the schools 
main gate and ended when a shop hit by firebombs caught fire 
students offered police hoses to fight the fire until firefighters 
arrived 
no injuries or arrests were reported 
korea university is in northeastern seoul about 15 miles from 
the olympic park where the games are being held 
student leaders said they refrained from violence during the 
olympics but now would retaliate for the arrest of oh on sept 22 
radical leaders earlier threatened to disrupt olympic events 
including the marathon on sunday if oh was not released police 
refused to release oh and charged him tuesday with organizing major 
antigovernment demonstrations during the summer 
park sehjik head of the seoul olympic organizing committee 
said authorities were ready to deal with any threat from the 
radicals were all prepared he told reporters 
a huge banner with a picture of oh was hanging on the wall of 
the student union building inside the campus 
radical students opposed to the government of president roh 
taewoo have staged antiolympic protests to demand the games be 
shared with communist north korea 
just a handful of students have turned out for the mostly 
peaceful protests most south koreans want the games to be a major 
success and are critical of the radicals 
north korea is boycotting the olympics because its demand to be 
a cohost at the games was rejected by the international olympic 
committee the committee said the games are awarded to a single 
city and could not be shared

for the first time in six years the 
agriculture department is reporting on us aquaculture and how it 
stacks up as part of the nations food machine 
overall the departments economic research service reported 
tuesday aquaculture production has grown 20 percent a year since 
1980 production includes food and nonfood fish shellfish and 
aquatic plants 
domestic production of food fish and shellfish amounted to an 
estimated 700 million pounds in 1987 and was worth almost 550 
million at the farm gate compared with 203 million pounds and 191 
million in 1980 the agency said last year nonfood 
aquacultural production included among other items 715 million 
of baitfish and 23 million of tropical fish 
as aquaculture began to move up as an agricultural enterprise 
reports were issued in 1980 1981 and 1982 but then they fell 
victim to usda budget cuts however people kept eating more fish 
and commercial enterprises kept producing them 
during the 1980s americans have substantially increased the 
quantity of fish and shellfish in their diets despite the fact that 
seafood prices have risen considerably faster than those for some 
major competing sources of dietary protein the report said 
per capita consumption of all fishery products rose 18 percent 
to 202 pounds in 1987 from an estimated 171 pounds in 1980 
the largest sources of us fishery products are domestic wild 
harvests and imports the report said commercial fishermen landed 
a record 11 billion pounds of fish and shellfish last year with a 
wholesale value of 36 billion an increase of 18 billion pounds 
and 500 million from 1986 
imports were valued at a record 88 billion in 1987 led by 
17 billion worth of fresh and frozen shrimp lobster and tuna 
were next at 600 million and 500 million respectively 
catfish farming the large aquaculture industry produced over 
372 million pounds of products in 1987 the report said prices 
paid to farmers for catfish rose from 60 cents per pound in 
september 1987 to a record 80 cents this summer due to tight 
supplies 
most of the catfish farms are located in the south with 
mississippi the largest producer 
salmon production based in washington oregon california and 
maine and trout production centered in idaho are the second and 
third largest aquacultural food fish industries the report said 
crawfish production mostly in louisiana was estimated at 95 
million pounds in 1987 making it the largest aquacultural 
shellfish industry in the united states

the agriculture department says hog producers 
and importers have approved a program of mandatory assessments on 
themselves to promote pork and help boost the image of the swine 
industry 
assistant secretary kenneth a gilles said tuesday that 33534 
or 77 percent of the 43532 valid ballots cast were in favor of the 
checkoff plan only a simple majority was needed for approval 
the department conducted the referendum sept 78 at county 
offices 
gilles said that since a majority supported the program the 
national pork board which administers the program will continue 
to collect the assessments of one quarter of 1 percent of the 
market value of all hogs and pigs sold in the united states and an 
equivalent amount on all imported porcine animals pork and pork 
products 
the usda issued its order setting up the program on sept 5 
1986 and assessments began on nov 1 1986 but the 1985 law 
authorizing the program specified a referendum on the checkoff 
within 24 months to 30 months

no new longterm grain agreement is in sight 
yet but the agriculture department says the soviet union continues 
to buy us corn 
sales of an additional 550000 metric tons of us corn for 
delivery during the coming year were announced on tuesday 
the sales brought total corn sold to the soviets in the last 
four weeks for delivery in the 198889 year that started sept 1 to 
more than 35 million tons 
a metric ton is about 2205 pounds and is equal to 394 bushels 
of corn or 367 bushels of wheat or soybeans the 550000 tons of 
corn would be about 217 million bushels 
corn prices have been averaging about 261 per bushel at the 
farm level according to usda estimates meaning that the latest 
sale could have a farm value of around 57 million 
a fiveyear longterm grain agreement with the soviet union will 
expire sept 30 and negotiators are trying to work out a new one 
or at least an extension of the current agreement to take effect 
on oct 1 
but officials say the details of a new pact probably wont be 
worked out before the present agreement expires however the 
absence of a new agreement does not prevent further sales to the 
soviet union 
according to the current agreement the annual purchases are 
supposed to include a minimum of 4 million tons each of wheat and 
corn the soviets have the option of buying the remaining 1 million 
tons as wheat corn or soybeans with every ton of beans counting 
as two tons of grain up to a maximum of 1 million tons of grain 
equivalent 
prior to sales announced since sept 1 the soviet union had 
purchased 905 million tons of wheat and 517 million tons of corn 
for delivery in the fifth year of the agreement plus 830000 tons 
of soybeans and 13 million tons of soybean meal

sixteen police academy cadets who were 
hospitalized including one who required a liver transplant were 
not denied water or abused school officials said but the states 
top law official said the incident would be investigated further 
in the last 10 years weve trained 9800 cadets gary f 
egan executive director of the massachusetts justice training 
council said tuesday i dont know what went wrong 
the police cadets were treated at hospitals beginning sept 19 
the first day of classes for ailments ranging from exhaustion and 
dehydration to kidney failure a trainee who quit after the first 
day charged that access to water was limited 
at a boston news conference today state attorney general james 
shannon said his department was conducting the only probe into what 
happened at the training center and described egans conclusions 
as his opinion based on a very preliminary cursory 
investigation its certainly not the final word 
the academy located in agawam just south of springfield 
reopened today for academic classwork only after being shut for a 
week physical training has been suspended indefinitely 
egan said cadets had access to water during training and that 
activity on the first day was no more strenous than any other 
groups first day at the western massachusetts academy 
there was strenuous physical activities as there always was 
on that first day but we have found no one to date that was 
denied water upon request he told a news conference at council 
headquarters in this boston suburb 
the most seriously ill cadet timothy shepard a 25yearold 
pittsfield police trainee collapsed from heat stroke while running 
on the academy track and has been in a coma for a week 
he received a liver transplant early tuesday at 
presbyterianuniversity hospital in pittsburgh and remained in 
critical condition today a spokesman for family members said that 
gov michael s dukakis had telephoned them but relatives had 
asked that no details of the call be given out 
george f grady the states chief epidemiologist said the 
cadets who became ill suffered from dehydration and exhaustion he 
said 50 cadets who were tested showed slight to mild signs of 
kidney damage which can result from dehydration 
lawmakers and law enforcement officials said they would 
investigate training at massachusetts 12 police academies and 
conduct hearings on procedures 
shannon said that his departments chief civilian investigator 
a former fbi special agent has been appointed to head an 
investigation no one should make premature judgments there are 
many unanswered questions the attorney general said 
the training councils chairman winchester police chief john p 
mchugh apologized to the stricken cadets however several police 
chiefs in the western part of the state called upon the academy to 
reassign two state troopers who were leading the class that was 
stricken 
grady said it was believed the cadets became ill because they 
drank about onethird of the water they needed for the exercise 
they were doing 
asked if the cadets were at fault for not drinking enough water 
egan replied some of them were unaware of the fact that they 
were doing damage to themselves they had a chance to go home every 
night to rehydrate 
several stricken cadets told reporters they could not comment on 
their experiences at the academy without permission from 
supervisors there 
the cadet who quit after the first day mike purcell of 
northampton said the routine was severe and that trainees were 
allowed only two small cups of water before shepard collapsed 
ive been through basic training in the army and it was twice 
as bad as that he said the doctors told me that if i had gone 
back for a second day i could have suffered permanent kidney 
damage 
a spokesman at baystate medical center in springfield said 
shepard also suffered kidney problems and several of the other 
cadets received kidney dialysis six remained hospitalized

michael dukakis hit hard today at conduct in the reagan 
administration saying george bushs former colleagues include 
dozens who broke the law and violated the public trust bush 
defended his taxdeferred savings plan that stirred criticism and 
little support when he unveiled it a day earlier 
dukakis in greensburg pa said that as president he would 
sign an executive order barring former top members of his 
administration from lobbying the government as long as he was in 
office 
high government office is a public trust not a training camp 
for foreign lobbyists or a vehicle for private gain he said at a 
rally 
george bush may be satisfied with this administrations hall 
of shame dozens of top administration officials who broke the 
law and violated the public trust he may be satisfied with letting 
japan make the cars while his former colleagues make the license 
plates i say america can do better than that dukakis said 
the massachusetts governor said he would close a deaver 
loophole under which he said the reagan administration divided up 
the executive office of the president to allow someone leaving the 
white house staff to immediately lobby other offices within the 
executive office 
former white house aide michael deaver was found guilty of lying 
when he said he couldnt remember contacting former administration 
officials on behalf of corporations paying him big fees 
bush meanwhile setting out on a bus tour through illinois 
defended his proposal for a taxdeferred savings plan while saying 
a college loan program advanced by dukakis would put the irs on 
your tail for the rest of your life 
although dukakis has scorned bushs new plan for taxdeferred 
savings saying it would save americans no more than 20 a year 
bush said his dayold proposal would give taxpayers a little nest 
egg 
he slashed at dukakis plan for college loans that would be paid 
back according to an individuals future earnings through tax 
withdrawals 
he wants to spend more and i want to put more money in the 
hands of individuals not in the hands of government bush said 
democratic vice presidential candidate lloyd bentsen also hit 
hard at bush and running mate dan quayle today in harry trumans 
hometown of independence mo 
bentsen ridiculed bushs contention that dukakis is out of the 
political mainstream saying it is bushs running mate quayle who 
is an archconservative with views in line with sens jesse helms 
and gordon humphrey 
as for the prospect of a quayle presidency if the republicans 
win in november he said ill tell you if they were elected 
id pray for the good health of george bush every night 
the vice president campaigning in the midwest on tuesday 
introduced his individual savings account plan as an 
opportunity for low and middleincome savers to put away up to 
1000 a year and defer paying taxes on the interest 
bush said the system would help americans be better able to 
afford a home pay for college or start a business 
but dukakis calculating that the plan would provide a mere 20 
a year to the taxpayer questioned whether his gop opponent was 
offering a serious solution to the economic crunch facing the 
middle class 
twenty bucks a year thats mr bushs solution for average 
americans dukakis told an audience in the chicago suburb of 
melrose park he says it will make them and here im quoting 
better able to afford a home pay for college start a business 
twenty bucks a year whos he kidding 
bushs running mate dan quayle was spending his second 
consecutive day in texas with campaign appearances in el paso 
amarilo and dallas the republican vice presidential nominee was 
expected to be the focus of lloyd bentsens speech today in 
independence mo where the democrat was planning to discuss 
qualifications for the vice presidency 
in the latest public opinion poll 42 percent of 416 likely 
voters surveyed said sundays debate between bush and dukakis was a 
tie or didnt know who won more than double the 20 percent who 
expressed one of those views after the debate 
the abc news poll which included voters who had not seen the 
debate but had heard or read about it indicated the other 
postdebate polls and news media accounts reinforced perceptions 
that the debate was a dead heat 
the poll was conducted monday night and had a margin of error of 
plus or minus six percentage points 
on tuesday at an appearance in columbus ohio bush introduced 
his plan to allow small savers to defer paying taxes on interest 
income on savings of up to 1000 a year as long as the money is 
kept in such accounts for five or more years 
the gop nominee touted the plan as a way to provide additional 
money for home purchases and college educations but bush aides 
suggested later that the proposal was less farreaching 
the campaign said the plan which would be available to those 
with adjusted gross incomes up to 50000 would only yield about 
14 a year in tax savings for the maximum deposit 
campaigning in illinois dukakis suggested that bushs main 
concern is cutting the capital gains tax from its present maximum 
of 33 percent to 15 percent a benefit for the nations wealthy

prime minister margaret 
thatcher heavily guarded during a surprise visit to northern 
ireland said wednesday that britain is more determined than ever 
to defeat terrorism 
i feel strongly that terrorism must never never win she 
told a group of police officers and widows of murdered members of 
the force in east belfast if it did that would spell the end of 
democracy 
mrs thatcher stayed away from roman catholic strongholds but 
protestant demonstrators in lisburn yelled traitor traitor 
traitor and go back to england as she made her way through 
the streets where six soldiers were blown up by an irish republican 
army bomb in june 
the demonstrators oppose the 1985 angloirish agreement giving 
the irish republic a voice in northern irelands administrative 
affairs some protestants see the accord as a betrayal by the 
british and the first step toward a catholicdominated united 
ireland 
mrs thatcher who escaped an ira assassination attempt at a 
1984 conference of her governing conservative party told the 
police officers she heard people suggest that more ira attacks 
would make the public weary 
you dont know the spirit of northern ireland or the spirit of 
the united kingdom she said the more difficult things are 
the greater our resolve determination and courage to defeat that 
terrorism which is a cancer in our midst 
the ira is fighting to oust britain from protestantdominated 
northern ireland and unite the province with the roman catholic 
irish republic under a socialist government 
this year it has stepped up its attacks on british soldiers 
killing 27 in northern ireland mainland britain and continental 
europe leaders of sinn fein the iras legal political wing have 
said one aim of targeting the soldiers is to create public 
opposition to a continued british presence in the province 
security forces mounted a huge security operation for mrs 
thatchers visit her second to northern ireland in less than a 
year last november she attended a memorial service in enniskillen 
for 11 people killed when the ira bombed a ceremony for britains 
war dead 
no advance information on her itinerary was released for 
security reasons 
sinn fein publicity director danny morrison said the secrecy and 
intense security shows how vulnerable she feels and just how 
tenuous is british rule here 
mrs thatcher told the police officers that she was grateful for 
the sacrifices of their colleagues and their continued efforts to 
maintain freedom and democracy among the audience was policewoman 
alison johnston 26 who lost an eye in an ira bombing in county 
fermanagh on aug 18 
when we have got rid of terrorism and we must get rid of 
terrorism this is a marvelous country a country which can be very 
prosperous if again you can get the security that the rest of us 
in the united kingdom take for granted she said 
mrs thatcher also visited several thriving factories and 
businesses during her daylong tour john hume leader of the 
moderate catholic social democratic and labor party said he hoped 
her visit would help create new jobs

the connecticut board of parole today 
denied early release for the man convicted in the 1979 
strangulation of a 14yearold stamford girl after an emotional 
plea from the victims father 
it is an insult to our daughters memory that he could even be 
considered eligible for parole in less than nine years charlie 
hoyt told the parole board during a brief hearing today at somers 
state prison 
bruce d williams jr pleaded guilty to firstdegree 
manslaughter under a 1980 plea bargain agreement a rape charge was 
dropped under the agreement he was sentenced to 20 years to life 
in the death of hoyts daughter sandy who was lured to williams 
stamford home with the promise of her first babysitting assignment 
last week hoyt presented the boards chairman richard 
reddington with more than 23500 petition signatures urging that 
williams be denied parole 
williams 35 appeared briefly before the board today asking 
the threemember panel to review his prison record and his efforts 
to obtain a college degree while in prison he did not mention the 
girls death 
while addressing to the board hoyt broke down and had 
difficulty getting through his statement 
if there are any doubts in your minds about this monster then 
i suggest that the board take some time and view his videotaped 
confession hoyt said 
it took the board members only 10 minutes in executive session 
to decide to deny williams bid for release when they emerged 
reddington told williams that because of the extreme 
seriousness of his offense his request was being denied 
the board scheduled another hearing for september 1994 with next 
potentional rlease date of jan 12 1995 
ill be there hoyt said 
in 1983 hoyts lobbying helped prompt legislators to enact a 
law that allows victims of most serious felonies to testify at an 
inmates parole hearing 
hoyt began his petition drive aimed at keeping williams behind 
bars hoping to collect 10000 signatures but ended up with more 
than twice that 
people want to do something about the system he said last 
week 
hoyt who now lives in fairield says williams called sandy and 
said he was a doctor and needed someone to watch his child while he 
went on an emergency call 
he took her to his house though williams young child was in 
the house he tied sandy to a bed raped her and then strangled 
her hoyt said

israeli foreign minister shimon peres today 
dismissed the view held by some senior us and egyptian officials 
that the palestine liberation organization was undergoing an 
evolution toward acceptance of the jewish state 
they continue their acts of terror to this very day in spite 
of hints to the contrary peres said after a meeting with 
secretary of state george p shultz 
a change in plo policy toward israel could remove a major 
roadblock to arabisraeli negotiations 
egyptian foreign minister esmat abdel meguid told president 
reagan during a meeting on monday that senior plo leaders had come 
around to the view that israel had a right to exist and were trying 
to persuade other elements of yasser arafats organization to go 
along 
this view is shared by senior state department officials who 
detected signs of moderation in a recent speech by chairman arafat 
but peres who participated in the meeting with reagan and 
meguid said he did not understand when people say there are 
moderate people in the plo 
i know only about moderate decisions because we are not 
dealing with the psychology of people peres said we are 
dealing with the nature of the situation 
peres said he discussed with shultz steps that might be taken to 
promote peace talks in the remaining four months of the reagan 
administration shultz has warned against a continuing vacuum 
in the region 
but there was no indication that a way had been found to break 
the stalemate 
peres said there were some sweet sweet definitions in 
arafats speech in strasbourg france but it lacked any 
realistic suggestions

bentsen stepping out of michael dukakis shadow to deliver his 
assessment of the vice presidency did not mention either george 
bush or dan quayle in his speech but he made it clear he 
questioned bushs judgment as well as quayles qualifications to be 
a heartbeat away from the nations highest office 
like harry truman i think im ready the texas senator told 
students at a high school named after the former president 
recalling trumans elevation from vice president in 1945 when 
franklin roosevelt died ready to run and serve with mike 
dukakis ready to help him lead america to a new era of greatness 
and if tragedy should ever strike the president of the united 
states i think im ready to lead america bentsen said 
at a news conference after the speech democrat bentsen meade it 
clear he did not view his colleague from indiana as being up to 
that task 
ill tell you if they were elected id pray for the good 
health of george bush every night bentsen said 
polls have shown voter uncertainty over the 41yearold quayle 
and after weeks of trying to make quayle a major campaign issue 
the dukakis campaign decided to dedicate an entire bentsen event to 
a discussion of the vice presidency 
bush and quayle have tried to portray dukakis as a liberal far 
to the left of the american mainstream but bentsen tried to turn 
the issue around saying quayle is an archconservative much more 
in tune with jesse helms and gordon humphrey than he is with 
george bush 
asked if bush was in the mainstream bentsen characterized the 
vice president as someone who has repeatedly flipflopped on 
important issues 
id have to look at vice president bushs latest positions on 
the issues to be sure of that bentsen told reporters 
and he criticized bush for selecting quayle saying even 
republican senators were shocked by the choice 
in his speech bentsen recalled hearing of roosevelts death 
while flying back from a world war ii bombing mission and he also 
spoke of meeting president truman during bentsens first term as a 
congressman from texas later bentsen said he was given the 
senate office formerly used by truman 
somehow sitting in harry trumans office made me feel i had a 
lot to live up to in washignton bentsen said 
after listing his experience as a representative businessman 
and senator who rose to chairman of the finance committee bentsen 
took an oblique swipe at bush and the relatively unknown quayle 
i think anyone who runs for vice president must earn the 
respect of the american people bentsen said and he must enjoy 
the trust and respect of the president if a presidential candidate 
does not choose a running mate with those qualifications he does 
not respect the importance and dignity of the office of the vice 
presidency 
that office bentsen said should be occupied by a trusted 
adviser to the president willing to speak out when someone comes 
up with the idea of selling arms to the ayatollah in exchange for 
hostages 
bentsen in another salvo at bush said the vice president 
must be more than a backup chief executive and he praised 
dukakis for selecting a running mate who differs with him on 
several issues 
he does not want his vice president to hide behind some lame 
excuse by saying i just wasnt in the loop i wasnt in the loop 
all 17 times that was discussed bush has used terms such as 
not in the loop to say he was not fully informed about the deal 
at the center of the irancontra affair 
bentsen also used his visit to trumans hometown to paint 
dukakis as a democrat in the truman mold willing unlike bush to 
take responsibility for his actions

emperor hirohito received another blood transfusion 
wednesday and more intravenous doses of nutrients but a newspaper 
said the 87yearold monarchs strength was waning dangerously 
after nine days without solid food 
the 043pint transfusion was hirohitos eighth in six days and 
brought the total since his condition worsened on sept 19 to 68 
pints more than twothirds the usual amount of blood in the 
emperors body news reports said 
kyodo news service reported that a vehicle carrying blood was 
seen entering the imperial palace wednesday evening but the 
imperial household agency said there was no immediate plan to give 
the worlds longest reigning living monarch another transfusion 
palace officials said earlier that the emperor had discharged a 
small amount of blood a sign his internal bleeding had not stopped 
they said his condition was stable and that by evening he was 
resting but after nearly two days of stable readings his 
temperature rose to 100 degrees in the afternoon by evening it 
eased to 989 degrees still above his normal temperature of 959 
degrees 
chief palace physician akira takagi said the large transfusions 
apparently did not harm hirohitos heart or kidney functions so 
doctors planned to continue them to compensate for blood lost in 
internal bleeding 
but news reports quoted several private physicians as saying the 
emperors condition remains unpredictable due to lack of nutrition 
and high levels of bile causing jaundice 
the doctors have said they believe the emperors swollen 
pancreas may have interferred with the flow of bile possibly 
contributing to a festering internal infection also linked to the 
internal bleeding 
in its evening edition the yomiuri shimbun japans largest 
newspaper quoted sources close to the court doctors as saying that 
the intravenous feeding has clearly left the emperor without 
enough nutrition and the weakening of his overall condition is 
causing concern 
hirohito has had no solid food in nine days he has been in 
serious condition since he vomited blood on sept 19 on saturday 
his temperature reached 1026 degrees but doctors were able to 
bring his fever down with antibiotics 
palace officials have refused to confirm or deny news reports 
that the emperor has cancer and have urged the media to refrain 
from such speculation because it might dishearten the emperor who 
they say is conscious and has been watching television 
imperial household agency officials said that as of wednesday 
about 647000 people had signed their names to registries set up at 
the palace and at 11 other agencyrelated facilities around the 
country to wish for the emperors early recovery 
another 136 million others also signed their names in 
registries set up by local governments across japan according to 
national police agency figures 
under the constitution the emperor has no political power but 
signs documents already approved by the government and serves as a 
symbol of the unity of japan

the five members of the nobel prize 
committee met behind locked doors wednesday to choose the winner of 
the 1988 peace prize 
president reagan and soviet leader mikhail s gorbachev were 
mentioned as leading contenders for the prestigious award 
the committees regulations bar it from divulging names but the 
oslo daily vg speculated the superpower leaders would share the 
honor for signing a treaty to dismantle intermediaterange nuclear 
weapons and putting arms control efforts on a new course 
committee chairman egil aarvik was to announce the decision at 2 
pm 9 am edt thursday 
the committee made its selection from an initial list of 97 
candidates at a twohour session at the nobel institute a 
twostory building in the shadow of the royal palace in downtown 
oslo 
the list included 74 individuals and 23 organizations 
wednesdays session was the groups first formal meeting since 
midaugust but nobel officials indicated that a consensus emerged 
even before the final session 
the prize carries a cash award of 390000 
aarvik quashed speculation about un secretary general javiar 
perez de cuellar he said the un chief was not nominated before 
the feb 1 deadline for this years prize 
among other candidates reportedly on the list were the world 
health organization the un interim force in lebanon un 
mediator diego cordovez anglican church envoy to lebanon terry 
waite the greenpeace environmentalist group jailed african 
national congress leader nelson mandela and norwegian prime 
minister gro harlem brundtland who chaired a un environmental 
commission 
helge pharo a consultant for the committee said the list of 
candidates was whittled down to about six by the summer and was 
further narrowed at the last meeting in august 
pharo told the associated press he and a second consultant 
prepared reports and profiles of the candidates that sometimes ran 
up to 20 pages long 
the decision is by consensus and the committee members do not 
vote he said 
last years peace laureate was president oscar arias of costa 
rica for his central american peace plan 
the peace prize is the first to be announced of five awards 
founded by the estate of alfred nobel the inventor of dynamite who 
died in 1896 a sixth prize in economics was added in 1968 and 
funded by the bank of sweden 
the prizes for medicine physics and chemistry will be announced 
in midoctober in stockholm no date has been set for the 
literature prize announcement also in the swedish capital 
nobels testament dictated that the peace prize be awarded by a 
committee elected by the norwegian parliament but his reasoning 
remains a mystery norway and sweden were under one monarchy until 
1905 
the will said the prize should go to the person who has worked 
most for fraternity between peoples for the abolition or 
reduction of standing armies and for the holding and promotion of 
peace congresses 
but the committee has expanded the definition to encompass human 
rights activists such as us author elie wiesel in 1986 polish 
union leader lech walesa in 1983 soviet dissident andrei sakharov 
in 1975 and us civil rights leader martin luther king in 1964 
in addition to aarvik a retired journalist and former cabinet 
minister the committee members are history professor francis 
sejersted former prime minister odvar nordli gunnar j staalsett 
a priest and head of the genevabased lutheran world federation 
and author gidske anderson 
members are elected to sixyear terms

sen brock adams says he made an error in 
judgment by allowing a 26yearold woman to spend the night at 
his house last year but he denies allegations that he sexually 
assaulted her 
these charges are absolutely false adams dwash told 
reporters on tuesday i have never had a desire to hurt this 
woman or her family and i dont know why they are trying to hurt 
me and my family 
the woman kari tupper a former congressional secretary whom 
adams has known since she was a child has been unavailable for 
comment in washington state where she now lives with her husband 
but she has previously given interviews to a reporter from the 
washingtonian which plans to publish a story in novembers 
editions the story will also appear in fridays editions of a 
seattle newspaper the magazine said in a statement today 
the statement said ms tupper told a reporter that adams began 
making sexual advances to her in april 1985 
she also said that on the night of march 27 1987 adams offered 
her a glass of wine at his home and bragged about his sexual 
conquests after finishing the wine the magazine paraphrased her 
as saying her last memory was going to the bathroom 
she awoke the next morning naked in bed besides adams and 
his hands caressing her body the magazine said in the statement 
she claimed she was drugged 
adams spokeswoman did not immediately return a telephone call 
to discuss the article which the magazine declined to provide to 
the associated press 
but on tuesday adams claimed tupper threatened to file a 
civil lawsuit unless i paid 400000 in hush money betty and i 
refused her demands i will not be blackmailed adams wife 
betty was at his side during the press briefing 
adams 61 a former transportation secretary in the carter 
administration said he should never have invited tupper to spend 
the night at his house on march 27 when mrs adams was not around 
i made an error in judgment that put me in a position where i 
could be falsely accused he said for that i apologize to my 
family friends and the people of the state of washington 
tupper was an 18000ayear secretary with the house select 
committee on aging at the time she filed a report with the 
metropolitan police department on july 24 1987 alleging that 
adams had fondled her breasts and buttocks adams was not 
identified by name in the complaint 
she alleged that the incident took place in adams house in an 
exclusive residential section nearly four months earlier between 
915 pm on march 27 and 630 am on march 28 according to the 
report 
capt william white iii of the district of columbia police said 
the allegation of simple assault was investigated we consider 
the matter closed white told the seattle postintelligencer 
which first reported the story the us attorneys office reviewed 
the case but did not press charges 
in a twopage statement adams gave the following account of the 
events on march 27 he refused to answer any questions 
adams said tupper had asked to meet him march 27 1987 at a 
swank italian restaurant in georgetown to discuss her job 
situation at the request of tuppers family adams had helped 
tupper secure a position on capitol hill after his election in 1986 
adams said he called her office that day to confirm the dinner 
date but was told she was ill assuming the meeting was off adams 
went home to play tennis with three friends 
later that night tupper upset that adams had not showed up at 
the restaurant called him at his home to ask if she could drop by 
adams said she had visited the house in the past and had stored 
belongings in the basement 
after she arrived the pair went to a neighborhood restaurant 
but it was closed neither was feeling very well adams said so 
the pair returned to his home to get her car 
once there the woman came back into the house at this point 
i told her i was exhausted and was going to sleep adams said 
i told her that she was welcome to stay at the house if she 
was not well enough to drive home she said she preferred to stay 
and then i went to bed alone i did not sexually assault the woman 
looking back i should have called her a cab but at the time 
the suggestion seemed appropriate for a family friend who was upset 
about her job and not feeling well adams said

the main opposition group accused the 
military government wednesday of killing nearly 1000 people since 
a sept 18 coup and it registered as a political party to 
challenge 26 years of authoritarian rule 
a second prodemocracy group made up of followers of former 
prime minister u nu also registered wednesday and a third 
opposition political party announced its formation 
some burmese said soldiers were sealing off urban centers to 
prevent people from fleeing to rebelcontrolled areas to carry on 
the fight for democracy 
several hundred students have fled to the thaiburmese border 
where large areas are controlled by the karen mon shan and other 
minority groups the students are seeking military training from 
the karens perhaps the most powerful of the rebel groups 
there are tens of thousands of students and monks who want to 
leave the cities but cannot said ko ko a 35yearold teacher 
from rangoon who arrived tuesday at a karen camp next to the thai 
border 
soe hlaing a 36yearold lawyer from pegu said he saw nine 
people executed by soldiers on a bridge in the town of tharrawdy 
during his flight to the karencontrolled areas 
each was shot with a gun one bullet to the heart soe 
hlaing said 
the key opposition alliance the national league for democracy 
said it had not decided whether to participate in elections 
promised by the government under burmese law it had to register 
with the government to take part in the vote 
league spokesman win htein said the government must create a 
democratic situation by ending random arrests and allowing free 
speech and press before the league can contemplate participation in 
elections 
win htein accused the military government of killing nearly 
1000 people since sept 18 but said he had no proof of summary 
executions of antigovernment leaders the government says about 
350 people have been killed 
win htein said the league did not encourage the flight to rebel 
areas some western analysts said they believed the rush to rebel 
areas would have little effect on the struggle between the military 
government and opposition forces 
they will rot in the jungles said one western diplomat in 
bangkok they may kill a few burmese soldiers but the great 
strength of the prodemocracy side was the mass peaceful 
demonstrations and strikes in rangoon and those appear to be 
over 
win htein said the league has started to send teams from rangoon 
to organize grassroots opposition to the militarybacked political 
apparatus that has rule burma for 26 years 
retired brigadier general aung gyi was named league chairman on 
tuesday two other key prodemocracy leaders former defense 
minister tin oo and aung san suu kyi daughter of burmas main 
revolutionary martyr are top officers in the alliance 
we have already sent some people to the countryside said 
win htein in a telephone interview 
the alliance has an uphill battle to challenge the national 
unity party the new name for the ruling burma socialist program 
party 
western analysts say gen saw maung who seized power in the 
sept 18 coup is unquestionably behind the national unity party 
he ordered troops to gun down antigovernment demonstrators who for 
weeks filled rangoons streets in protest marches 
saw maung has called for multiparty general elections but has 
set no date 
the government decreed tuesday that rebels foreignaided 
groups the military civil servants and organizations which 
misuse religion will not be allowed to form political parties 
the other opposition group to register with the government was 
the democracy party the formation of the national democratic party 
also was announced but it did not register with the government

nasa today cleared discovery for 
flight giving the goahead for a launch at 959 am edt thursday 
its been a long 2 years the space shuttle administrator said 
as nasa workers prepared for the first us manned mission since 
the challenger tragedy 
richard truly briefed five anxious astronauts just minutes after 
the space agencys new launch directorate completed a preflight 
review truly described the crew as elated to be heading for 
space 
anticipation and tension rose across the nasa system as final 
preparations accelerated even the weather is looking good 
truly said the space shuttle is ready to fly 
right now we see no constraints nasa test director frank 
merlino said as the space agency said one nagging technical problem 
had been resolved were looking forward to a good countdown and 
a safe launch 
robert crippen the veteran astronaut who has oneman authority 
to approve or veto the longawaited launch effort supervised the 
meeting of nasa launch officials the group gave its approval for 
shuttle fueling beginning late wednesday night 
an equipment flaw that threatened to delay the launch was 
resolved by engineers who worked through the night industry 
contractors reported to crippen today that the problem involving a 
damaged oring on a rocket being prepared for a future shuttle 
flight should have no impact on the discovery mission 
a statement said the problem had been reviewed by all levels of 
nasa management and that a similar rocket on discovery had been 
cleared for flight 
truly said the payload is ready to fly the payload is a 
gigantic datarelay satellite to be launched from the shuttle just 
six hours after liftoff 
we have to be successful said kennedy space centers 
director forrest mccartney in reflecting on the discovery launch 
the nation could not withstand another accident like challenger 
discoverys crew frederick h hauck richard o covey george 
d nelson john m lounge and david c hilmers planned a 
leisurely day today receiving briefings on launch preparations and 
visiting with their wives at crew quarters seven miles from the 
launch pad 39b 
the technical question arose not with discovery itself but with 
a small satellite booster rocket being readied for a shuttle flight 
next february scientists want to be certain a tiny cut found on 
one of its oring seals does not exist on a twin rocket whose 
launch is discoverys main item of business 
the cut apparently was inflicted during installation and does 
not represent a design or manufacturing defect to be certain they 
worked overnight checking documentation and pressuretesting 
deliberately flawed rings 
launch for the fourday flight is set for 959 am with a 
2hour window that allows for weather or technical delays 
nasa officials said theyd done everything possible to make the 
mission safe 
you cant totally take the risk out of something like this 
mccartney said in an interview but in those last hours of the 
count ill know that we have done everything we know how to make 
this a safe flight that we have reduced the risks as much as we 
possibly can 
asked what would be going through his mind as the count ticks 
down the centers deputy director tom utsman said ill be 
saying that hopefully we have done all the right things that we 
havent taken any shortcuts that we havent overlooked anything 
id be a liar if i said i wasnt nervous but i also am confident 
though thursdays forecast called for generally clear skies 
with widely scattered showers crippen said tuesday that the 
biggest threat could come from surface winds prevalent here this 
time of the year 
he said liftoff would be delayed if winds exceeded 19 mph from 
the south because they would cause stress on discoverys aft skirt 
a crosswind greater than 14 mph also would not be acceptable at the 
shuttle runway here in case the astronauts had to make an emergency 
landing 
crippens launch directorate made up of 21 national aeronautics 
and space administration and contractor engineers and managers was 
created to overcome management problems that contributed to the 
jan 28 1986 challenger explosion that killed the seven crew 
members 
crippen said the teams initial meeting tuesday which lasted 
several hours provided an excellent review that revealed no 
problems such as the ones that never were aired before top launch 
officials prior to the challenger disaster 
the nicked oring is used as a pressure seal in an inertial 
upper stage rocket needed to boost a communications satellite to a 
higher orbit after it has been released by the astronauts from the 
cargo bay it is not the same type of oring that failed and caused 
the challenger explosion 
the 100 million satellite and its rocket already had been 
tested and approved for flight aboard discovery when the problem 
was discovered monday on similar hardware being readied for the 
february launch

steve nesbitt hopes a successful 
launch for discovery will bring his career as nasa commentator 
full circle and help erase the awful memory of being at the 
microphone when challenger blew up and left him searching for the 
right words 
i knew i had tremendous pressure to say something 
obviously he recalled recently i just felt this compelling 
need to keep talking except there was no information 
nesbitt sat in mission control on jan 28 1986 preparing to 
take over the commentary from kennedy space center as soon as 
challenger cleared the launch tower he was listening to flight 
controllers reading off altitude and velocity numbers and only 
occasionally glancing at the television screen that showed the 
ascending shuttle 
suddenly he heard the flight surgeon exclaim what was that 
i knew instantly this was terribly wrong but i had not seen 
the initial part of it all i saw was this white cloud and two 
solid rocket boosters srbs 
but i didnt see a shuttle 
nesbitt said he didnt want to speculate about the fate of the 
astronauts and the orbiter at that instant 
i just had this belated look at the television screen which 
is about like looking through a pipe you dont see the whole sky 
and youre asking yourself if there is an orbiter there ditching 
into the ocean or did it somehow come free and is flying back you 
cant immediately go announce to the world that everybody has been 
killed when you dont know that 
the three short sentences nesbitt adlibbed were replayed 
endlessly by the nations tv and radio networks flight 
controllers are looking very carefully at the situation obviously 
a major malfunction we have no downlink 
to many those words were a bewildering understatement nesbitt 
is still asked about them even at parties why did you say that 
why didnt you say it exploded 
in hindsight he said he doesnt think he could have done 
anything different 
nesbitt 37 has received a promotion at jsc from public 
affairs specialist to deputy director of the media services branch 
and discovery may be his last flight as a commentator 
i requested to be able to do this launch he said it 
would give me a feeling of having come full circle not ending my 
career as a commentator on that mission challenger would really 
mean a lot to me you dont want to leave after a failure you want 
to quit while youre successful 
hes certain hell be tense thursday morning pacing and 
drinking lots of coffee during the couple of hours before his job 
begins 
im always nervous for launches but i think ill be even more 
so for this one he said not only because i know of the things 
that can happen having seen it all but just knowing that so 
many people are going to be watching and its all under a 
microscope i better not make any mistakes

you know something important and 
dangerous is unfolding here at the kennedy space center because the 
nasa people are so nervous the industry representatives are so 
subdued and the tools of technology are so awesome 
not space technology broadcast technology 
they are all here skylink 11 starcam 8 mundo latino skycom 
7 live star 5 american uplink inc satellink 4 star 9 and of 
course space link 13 to say nothing of eyewitness news 10 newsat 
and a host of newstars too numerous to mention fiftyfive 
satellite uplinks in all 
not to be outdone by the local tv setups someone at abc 
stenciled the words jennings and gibson on a news trailer 
door presumably so the anchors wouldnt get lost among the sea of 
network news facilities later the stencil was changed to an 
incrementally less pretentious anchors office 
on wednesday nasa approved discovery for flight 
there is much to be nervous subdued and awesome about 
thursdays scheduled launch is probably the most important american 
space milestone since neil armstrong planted his one small step on 
the moon 
in the 19 years since the united states returned to the moon 
five times developed the skylab space station conducted a 
remarkable joint mission with soviet cosmonauts and invented a 
space shuttle fleet that made 24 successful flights in less than 
five years 
some of those missions were exciting and all of them important 
but none was so perilous to the american manned space program as 
the one scheduled to start at midmorning thursday the challenger 
accident in 1986 with schoolchildren watching all across the 
world cast an exceptional pall over the space program and many 
believe the shuttle program could not survive a catastrophe to 
discovery or its fiveman crew 
its got to work says rick hauck discoverys bluntspoken 
commander we clearly cannot afford to lose another vehicle much 
less another crew i dont think the manned spaceflight program 
could withstand another challenger 
no one expects another explosion but people are spooked by the 
eerie string of postchallenger accidents that doomed a titan a 
delta and an atlascentaur the previously reliable workhorses of 
americas unmanned rocket fleet 
with the past three years so bizarre and unfortunate no wonder 
the buttonmakers have dubbed this flight back to future 
the nervousness among the nasa people is easy to sense here at 
the launch site space workers will not soon take for granted that 
in a doordie business the good guys always do yet aside from 
the danger to man and machine there is an almost palpable threat 
to the nations spirit of adventure and challenge notwithstanding 
an assurance from one top nasa official that the program would go 
on no matter what 16000 people work at kennedy space center and 
practically every one of them believes that hauck is right the 
loss of discovery would ground the shuttle program again probably 
forever 
industry is subdued in part because nasa has set an allbusiness 
tone to its backtospaceflight mission and in part because a 
utahbased rocketry company named morton thiokol inc was held 
largely to blame for the challenger accident thiokol was an 
ambitious selfpromoter in the donotdie days of the shuttle 
program at one point making up posters which showed a waving 
american flag against the background of a particularily spectacular 
shuttle launch 
way to go america crowed the thiokol poster 
it was shocking to learn during the challenger investigations 
that a thiokol official had been ordered by superiors to take off 
his engineering hat and put on his management hat an edict that 
undermined company engineers who opposed making the coldweather 
launch 
thiokol has been paying liability money ever since to the 
challenger astronauts survivors and the launchsite demeanor has 
changed for all the contractors there are still souvenirs floating 
around the space center but the industry news center is a work 
room again and the company representatives are less boosterish 
more tentative 
on the wall behind the thiokol booth hangs a color photograph 
depicting the five discovery astronauts along with a printed 
reminder perhaps to the people wearing thiokol management hats 
the sts26 crew is counting on you

the communist party on wednesday harshly 
criticized undisciplined members and said they were helping to 
increase inflation and corruption that threaten economic reform 
a frontpage editorial in the party newspaper the peoples 
daily accused local party units of seeking ways to profit 
illegally from the inflation and short supplies and ignoring orders 
from beijing to cut spending 
those who dont abide by the partys discipline must be 
punished the party warned in its harshest indictment of the role 
that officials and party members have played in the growing 
economic disorder 
the editorial probably was approved by the partys top 
policymaking central committee which began a closeddoor 
fiveday session monday the committee is expected to approve a 
twoyear moratorium on price reform and measures to control 
inflation and excessive capital construction 
chinas supreme court meanwhile ordered lower courts to punish 
government officials found guilty of profiteering and speculation 
those officials have seriously disrupted the normal economic 
environment and hampered the smooth progress of chinas reform and 
construction the court said 
it ordered an end to fining guilty officials rather than 
bringing criminal charges against them 
inflation has soared from about 7 percent last year to more than 
20 percent this year overspending by government offices and 
staterun factories and widespread speculation have been major 
factors although issuing too much currency and loose credit also 
is to blame 
reports appear in the official media almost daily about local 
government officials and factory managers many party members who 
bought goods at statesubsidized prices and resold them on the 
black market for huge profits 
the peoples daily lectured party members to put the collective 
good above individual profit it repeatedly stressed that the 
individual must submit to the organization and lowerlevel party 
organs to higher ones 
we must enforce party discipline to guarantee the benefit of 
the whole it said strict discipline and unanimous action are 
good traditions of our party 
the editorial did not address recent unconfirmed reports of 
divisions in the partys highest ranks over what economic course to 
take 
some foreign reports suggest that general secretary zhao ziyang 
who a year ago promoted rapid decentralization of the economy has 
been sidelined in economic policymaking because of the high 
inflation and a surge of bank withdrawals and panic buying 
but foreign diplomats believe zhao is not in serious political 
trouble even though his plan for rapid change has been shelved 
a party work meeting before the central committee session 
announced that restoring order would be the main task of the next 
two years putting planned price and wage reforms on hold 
officials insist they have not abandoned their longterm goal of 
modernizing the economy by replacing cumbersome central planning 
with market mechanisms 
but chinese and foreign economists note that market mechanisms 
cannot function properly until artificially low stateset prices 
are allowed to fluctuate with supply and demand 
the freeze in price reform also means the irrational pricing 
that has encouraged black marketeering will continue hampering the 
partys disciplinary drive

the decision to relocate half the 
journalists from the space shuttle press center by midnight before 
launch was condemned as irrational and illogical wednesday by 
reporters assigned to the discovery liftoff 
the logic escapes me said kathy sawyer of the washington 
post 
the air force citing safety concerns in the aftermath of the 
challenger disaster is limiting the number of reporters at nasas 
complex 39 press site to 1800 more than 5000 have applied for 
credentials 
i dont understand the difference between having 4000 here 
and 1800 here said john wilford of the new york times its 
just a lousy situation 
the times and the post like all newspapers were being 
restricted to two staffers at the press site until an hour after 
launch sawyer said the limitation would make her work 
logistically much more difficult since facilities at the 
remote site are rudimentary 
studies conducted by the air force in the wake of the jan 28 
1986 challenger accident and a titan 34d explosion three months 
later have raised safety concerns about the press site 42 miles 
from launch pad 39b 
reporters restricted from the main site will view the launch 
from a location about 6 miles from the pad along the nasa causeway 
the studies concern the patterns of falling debris from solid 
rockets should they malfunction just after launch and have to be 
blown up by a signal from the ground 
jerry hannifin a time magazine correspondent who has been 
covering space launches from the beginning has protested to the 
white house and nasa 
there are far greater dangers from mosquitoes that might be 
carrying yellow fever or malaria at the secondary press site than 
from an exploding srb solid rocket booster he said 
were separated from our mission its ominous hannifin 
said ive covered world war ii korea southeast asia this is 
just part of the business its our decision 
im not convinced its totally a matter of safety i think the 
military would prefer to launch this stuff just as they launch 
titans in secrecy 
nasa is allowing its regular day shift about 12800 workers to 
be on duty

for 67500 you can buy a slice of civil 
war history 38 acres of the battleground where gen ulysses s 
grant led 33000 union soldiers against the confederates in a one 
of the conflicts decisive battles 
also included in the bargain a fourbedroom twobath brick 
house barn shed dog pens possible yankee burial trench and an 
option to dig for artifacts 
bennie machost an oilfield worker knows the history of his 
champion hill property where grants forces defeated lt gen john 
clifford pembertons 30000 men may 16 1863 grant already had 
taken jackson about 25 miles to the east vicksburg another 20 
miles to the west would soon fall 
one of the battles was fought right here the 58yearold 
machost said waving at the ridge that runs through his front yard 
this right here was the confederates left added son 
bernard machost 33 of bolton if they could have held this 
 
the elder machost bought the property three or four years ago 
but he and his wife recently purchased a new home in arkansas 
where they plan to run a convenience store 
the family believes some of the heaviest fighting occurred on 
their nowpeaceful 38 wooded acres 
the 8th illinois and the 32nd ohio regiments stormed across an 
all but impossible hollow yelling fiercely as they charged the 
mississippians and a supporting georgia infantry unit according to 
edwin c bearss in his book decision in mississippi 
bernard machost armed with maps from bearss book believes 
that hollow is on the eastern side of his fathers land 
he said the front yard was where union soldiers overran the 1st 
mississippi light artillery despite the refusal of capt samuel j 
ridley of gluckstadt to desert his guns 
ridley singlehandedly continued to fire a cannon until pierced 
by six union minie balls bearss book says 
they was begging him dont shoot dont shoot they was 
going to take him prisoner bernard machost said he wouldnt 
quit shooting so they killed him 
the 1st mississippi light artillery entered the battle with 82 
men and ended up with eight in all 3851 confederates were 
killed wounded or reported missing the union lost a total of 
2441 men at champion hill according to historian bruce catton 
ive always wondered about that bernard machost said 
pointing to a trench along the propertys western edge it dont 
look like it ought to be there naturally ive always wondered if 
it might not have been a grave 
neither father nor son have come across any artifacts 
ive always wanted to get a metal detector and i never 
did bernard machost said 
i wouldnt even know what to look for his father said 
one time i thought id get a metal detector and find a piece of 
bolt or something but i dont have time my time is valuable 
he said he has refused requests to search the property even 
from a cousin 
in fact when i see em coming like theyre going to dig i 
tell em to get off cause theyre going to get shot he said

a survey of educators in urban schools 
indicates that a lack of resources and staff creates a negative 
environment which decreases teacher effectiveness a report 
released wednesday said 
our study shows what other studies have not looked at that 
working conditions do make a difference said tom corcoran a 
researcher with the institute for educational leadership they 
effect peoples willingness to commit to the school perform their 
jobs and how much work they are willing to give their motivation 
corcoran said the institutes study entitled working in urban 
schools validates what teachers surveys had been saying for 
years 
its a practical matter to the extent that if you provide 
better working conditions you get better work out of people and 
kids he said 
the nonprofit washingtonbased institute interviewed more than 
400 teachers principals and administrators at 31 schools in five 
cities detroit denver indianapolis new orleans and rochester 
ny 
the findings in the 161page report were endorsed by the 
nations main teacher unions the american federation of teachers 
and the national education association 
of the educators interviewed 75 percent said resources such as 
teaching material and equipment were inadequate and more than 85 
percent said insufficient staff was a problem 
thirtyfour percent said poor working conditions including 
rundown school buildings and heavy workloads for teachers were 
hurting teacher performance more than 40 percent said these 
conditions were undermining teacher morale 
we cant allow shortterm needs supplies physical plant 
etc to denigrate teachers morale to the point that longterm 
goals and objectives are put off or forgotten michael usdan 
institute president said in a statement 
corcoran added there was little disagreement among 
respondents not just disgruntled teachers crying for more 
dollars principals and school administrators echoed these 
concerns 
rachel hedding a member of the rochester ny school board 
said the study tells you specifically what things will make it 
better for adults and therefore for children 
more than half of the school staff members surveyed reported 
problems with inadequate working space which they attributed to 
overenrollment reductions in class sizes and space requirements 
for special programs 
the study said one respondent underscored the pessimism by 
noting that her school had turned closets into classrooms placed 
the ditto machine in the womens restroom and the special education 
staff into an unsafe closet with no ventilation no windows and 
exposed heating pipes 
teachers often requested more support staff counselors 
specialists social workers security staff nurses teachers aides 
rather than more classroom teachers 
one teacher said we are just able to deal with crisis 
intervention no time for followthrough 
the survey recommended that school districts try to duplicate 
conditions found in the best schools adequately maintained 
physical plants staff collegiality teacher involvement in 
decisionmaking and a sensitive but strong administrative 
leadership 
when these factors are present the study said teachers 
are ready to commit long hours under minimally adequate 
conditions to meet the needs of students

the drug indictment against panamas military ruler 
gen manuel antonio noriega was a political ploy intended to 
pressure him on the panama canal treaty his attorneys argued in 
documents unsealed wednesday 
but their 65page motion asking for dismissal of the trafficking 
charges makes no reference to vice president george bush or his 
campaign as prosecutors had feared when they asked that it be kept 
under wraps 
the motion was unsealed after the us attorneys office found 
it contained none of the possible blackmail they had feared 
noriega might use to bargain with the administration noriega has 
claimed in the past he had information that could hurt the bush 
campaign 
my concern was that they would use it as some sort of 
political leverage but they didnt said chief deputy assistant 
us attorney richard gregorie i dont think there is anything 
in there that is shocking 
whatever information damaging to george bush that may exist 
that information was not going to be raised in our motion unless it 
was relevant to the case said noriega defense attorney neal 
sonnett 
instead the defense motion argued that the us government has 
no right to prosecute noriega who is a de facto head of state and 
has diplomatic immunity it also alleged he is being selectively 
prosecuted for political reasons and that pretrial publicity will 
make it impossible to find an objective jury 
the 12count indictment returned by a federal grand jury in 
miami in february accused noriega of accepting 46 million in 
bribes from colombias violent medellin drug cartel a grand jury 
in tampa indicted noriega on three marijuana importation counts at 
the same time 
the motion filed in miami and sealed sept 14 argues the 
indictment was based upon impermissible considerations including 
political and foreign policy considerations 
sonnett said one foreign policy issue was pressure by 
conservatives in the reagan administration to renegotiate the 
panama canal treaty which was signed under the carter 
administration and hands full control of the canal over to panama 
at the end of this century 
there were attempts to modify aspects of the treaty sonnett 
said we argue that it was one of the circumstances leading up to 
a decision to attempt to get noriega out of power 
the motion contains quotes from the news media made by reagan 
administration officials such as undersecretary of state elliot 
abrams that the defense says demonstrate the political nature of 
the case 
abrams for example is quoted as saying in may that the 
indictment drove noriega crazy and gave us a terrific bargaining 
tool 
the defense calling the case against noriega indictment 
diplomacy notes that in march the government offered to 
guarantee it would not seek his extradition if he fled to spain 
and in may offered to drop the indictments altogether if he left 
panama

this little piggy is to go to the market 
but her friends want her at home 
park officials at the indiana dunes national lakeshore plan to 
take adrienne the pig to the butcher but some people have launched 
a savethepig petition drive 
the pig which is more than a year old is one of several 
animals at chellberg farm 
the farm is being run as it was in the 1880s and pigs go to 
market said glen alexander assistant lakeshore superintendent 
we dont feel that its in the interest of good historical 
representation to not market pigs 
but adriennes friends say she is no ordinary pig 
its like a petting zoo here said susie cutler a lawyer 
who works in chicago everyones gotten attached to her this 
is a silly policy 
alexander counters that it is the park services role to educate 
children about the facts of life he says one of those facts is 
that pigs arent pets 
were trying to teach children that one raises little pigs for 
market size and markets them and makes them into the things they 
eat for breakfast he said 
adriennes supporters will present 300 signatures on its 
petition next week

the stripping of ben johnsons olympic gold medal 
in a drug scandal has wounded canadian pride and shamed a nation 
hungry for a hero to replace hockey superstar wayne gretzky 
its like wayne gretzky getting run over by a car said pat 
reid the canadian highjump coach 
the spirit of a nation raced with johnson when he won the gold 
medal in the 100 meters on saturday with a world record time of 
979 seconds the euphoria was dashed when johnson tested positive 
for stanzolol a musclebuilding steroid outlawed by olympic 
officials he was stripped of the medal tuesday 
dr george astaphan johnsons personal physician and larry 
heidebrecht johnsons agent insisted the sprinter had not taken 
stanzolol 
the only thing we can say is that it is a tragedy a mistake 
or sabotage heidebrecht said 
johnson a 26yearold jamaican transplant waved the canadian 
flag in triumph and dedicated his gold to his mother and all 
canadian citizens 
he returned home with a jacket over his head hurdling a hedge 
to duck reporters after flying home from new york in the seclusion 
of a jet cockpit 
it was unheroic conduct for the worlds fastest human who had 
been awarded the order of canada and a medal from queen elizabeth 
at the commonwealth games 
johnsons disgrace was heralded in canadian headlines such as 
fools gold black day for canada seconds of glory 
years of shame from fame to shame and big ben is now 
hasben 
were feeling low some of us dont want to accept what 
happened said john furedy a psychologist at the university of 
toronto in assessing the mational psyche 
we all share some of the responsibility in the sense that we 
put such tremendous pressure on these people furedy said 
trent frayne sports columnist for the globe and mail of 
toronto said johnsons victory was the biggest event in canada 
since a national team beat the soviet union in a sevengame hockey 
series in 1972 
the drug scandal brought the same sickening feeling to the 
nation as did gretzkys trade to the los angeles kings 
there was enormous exhilaration then 72 hours later there 
was this roller coaster ride to the bottom frayne said the 
ben johnson episode is a tragedy of shocking proportions 
its as if an entire country has gone into a period of 
national mourning on his behalf wrote columnist john robertson 
of the toronto star 
canadian youth took the news hard 
we look up to the guy i guess we dont look up to him 
anymore said craig brown 13 of toronto 
hes letting all his fans down he let canada down said 
donny clarke 12 
canada has always tried to escape the influence of the united 
states where its dollar is worth 80 cents now it has forfeited 
its only gold medal of the olympics 
he has left canadians hanging their heads in shame wrote 
the corner brook western star 
he tarnished the name and reputation of canada and let its 
people down said the fredickton gleaner 
but columnist gary lautens of the toronto star said the nation 
should not cover its head in shame 
what johnson did was wrong its cheating its believing the 
end justifies the means its looking for an unfair edge lautens 
said but it is also just a foot race its time somebody 
reminded us nobody tried to peddle arms for hostages nobody shot 
down a civilian airliner nobody boobytrapped a home

christian army commander gen michel aoun 
said wednesday his troops will prevent lebanon from being 
partitioned rival moslem and christian cabinets appeared to take 
steps to avoid a confrontation 
late wednesday a car bomb exploded at a syrian army checkpoint 
just south of beirut killing five people and injuring 21 police 
said they said five syrian soldiers were among the injured no one 
claimed responsibility 
aoun 53 made his pledge in an order of the day to the 
42000man army 
the lebanese army is the only source to save lebanon from 
partition in spite of all regional and international pressures 
the solution is through you and with you the crisis will end 
the order said 
any other solution without you will fail you know perfectly 
well that nothing but the army can save lebanon from occupation and 
partition aoun said 
aoun was rejected by lebanons moslem majority after he was 
appointed prime minister by president amin gemayel on thursday in 
the last minutes of the presidents term 
parliament failed to elect a new president and gemayel named a 
new cabinet to serve as an interim government the appointment 
violated an unwritten covenant requiring the president to be a 
christian the prime minister a sunni moslem and the parliament 
speaker a shiite moslem 
aoun directly controls four brigades of about 15000 men based 
in east beirut and the christian heartland north of the capital 
five other brigades of about 18000 men based in west beirut and 
southern northern and eastern lebanon have pledged allegiance to 
the government of syrianbacked acting prime minister salim hoss a 
sunni moslem 
the hoss government was scheduled to meet on wednesday with the 
intention of firing aoun and naming a prosyrian maronite catholic 
officer as commander of the army sources close to hoss said 
but hoss called off the meeting and delayed the appointment of 
a new army commander to avert a further escalation in a conflict 
between the two governments one source said speaking on 
condition of anonymity 
in another move apparently aimed at defusing the tension hoss 
who heads the syrianbacked fiveman cabinet told reporters at his 
west beirut residence that his cabinet will not make any decisions 
that will confuse government and civil service departments 
we shall try to keep them going the way they have been before 
the crisis developed hoss said 
aoun and hoss have issued contradictory directives to civil 
servants since last thursday 
aoun in his statement to the army did not mention the hoss 
government which all his previous statements branded illegal 
also wednesday former president suleiman franjieh one of 
syrias strongest maronite catholic allies in lebanon arrived in 
west beirut a day before the start of a conference of prosyrian 
leaders opposed to aoun 
it was franjiehs first visit to beiruts moslem sector since 
the outbreak of lebanons civil war in 1975 when he was president 
syria lebanons main power broker backed 78yearold franjieh 
in augusts presidential election touching off a confrontation 
with rightwing christian militants 
in a related development the new us ambassador urged moslems 
and christians to speedily elect a new president to resolve the 
impasse 
ambassador john mccarthy met with moslem leaders to discuss the 
current deadlock 
he met with sheik hassan khaled spiritual head of the sunni 
moslem sect sheik mohammed mehdi shamseddin spiritual head of the 
shiite sect and nabih berri the main shiite moslem militia 
chieftain 
mccarthy told reporters he stressed to the moslem leaders the 
importance of carrying out the elections as soon as possible 
it seems to me that the religious leaders of lebanon have a 
very firm grip on what is needed for this country mccarthy added

the dukakis campaign unveiled advertisements 
aimed at the black community wednesday but they lacked the voice 
and image of the nations most prominent black leader jesse 
jackson 
producers of the 3 millionplus ad campaign said jackson thus 
far had been unavailable to spend two or three hours taping radio 
and television spots but said they were confident of recording him 
this week 
he is committed to making advertising said frank l mingo 
president of the agency hired by michael dukakis presidential 
campaign to produce the ads we simply havent been able to catch 
up with him 
jackson last visited new york on saturday he is planning to 
tape said a spokeswoman in chicago tanya mitchell asked when 
she said we dont have any information to release on that just 
yet 
mingos print ads for dukakis do not include a photograph of 
jackson they do bear a quote 10 reasons why we must work for 
fight for vote for michael dukakis over jacksons name and a 
listing of the reasons 
the print ads show a photo of dukakis shaking hands with a black 
woman as another black woman looks on 
we made the decision that if we made a photo of rev jackson 
maybe it looks more like a rev jackson ad mingo said at a news 
conference in his manhattan office this is a dukakis ad i mean 
he is the candidate 
there has been friction between jackson and the dukakis campaign 
over jacksons role in the campagin however mingo said that has 
passed citing jackson praise for dukakis last week before the 
congressional black caucus 
other black leaders in the advertising campaign include reps 
william gray of pennsylvania mickey leland of texas john lewis of 
georgia mervyn dymally of california and floyd flake of new york 
and the washington dc delegate walter fauntroy 
mingo said ads would be placed in national black magazines and 
newspapers and in 15 broadcast markets beginning this week 
it is far easier for me to go to washington and grab a bunch 
of congressmen and sit them down in a room than it is to find rev 
jackson mingo said you have to track him down on his own 
terms and you have to sit him down 
we are working with his staff to schedule time to do it 
mingo said and of course some of that has to be when he wants 
to do it

randy newman has never been accused of having a 
sunny outlook on life and his new album land of dreams is no 
bundle of joy 
for the first time i agree with people who are depressed about 
the future the singersongwriter said its amazing how the 
imperialist nations have paid for their imperialism its almost as 
if there were a god almost but not quite 
in the albums first single its money that matters a 
narrator asks people the meaning of life they answer with the 
songs title 
we all should be smart enough to know that money doesnt make 
us happy said newman 45 the trouble is that in america the 
smart people who opt for a life that isnt based on getting rich 
who decide to teach chemistry or work for a public radio station 
get their faces rubbed in it 
through television people in this country who dont have a 
lot are constantly reminded that life could be more comfortable 
he said 
the album is newmans first in 4 years

should they need to use the space shuttles new escape system 
eighteen of the socalled pjs were dispatched last wednesday 
from here to gambia and morocco on africas northwest coast they 
are members of the 1730th pararescue squadron the only unit in the 
us military dedicated solely to rescue work 
nine jumpers from the new york air national guard are stationed 
at patrick air force base near cape canaveral to provide rescue 
assistance should the astronauts bail out of the shuttle closer to 
florida than to africa also working out of patrick are 18 other 
pjs aboard rescue helicopters 
members of the 1730th all experienced jumpers and trained as 
paramedics approached the shuttle assignment with enthusiasm 
they usually trample each other to get a mission col 
edward behling the squadron commander said in an interview 
its like a fire department you only get a fire once in a 
while 
the shuttle escape system ordered by congress after the 
challenger disaster nearly three years ago can be used only after 
the spacecrafts solid rocket boosters are jettisoned two minutes 
into the flight thus the new system would not have saved the 
challenger astronauts 
if the shuttle fails to reach orbit once the boosters drop off 
the astronauts could attempt to slide out an escape hatch and 
parachute into the ocean with the mission more than two minutes 
underway the escape would likely be closer to africa than the us 
atlantic coast 
well be there to catch them if they fall said tech sgt 
john smith who heads the group deployed in morocco 
each of the two ninemember groups jump from a c130 hercules 
cargo plane the astronauts probably would scatter several miles 
apart each has an emergency transmitter that would automatically 
activate and a motorized rubber boat and medical supplies would be 
parachuted from 3000 feet along with the pjs once astronauts 
were located 
threeperson pj teams would man their boats and begin picking up 
astronauts each working toward the middle of the drop area where 
several life rafts and survival material would be located 
our first concern is finding the astronauts said smith 
the second is that the c130 have enough fuel to stay above the 
search area and give us vectors to where each of the astronauts 
are if youre out there in rough waters you cant see someone 
whos 20 feet away because of the swells 
each pj is trained to administer drugs and intravenous solutions 
if necessary behling said experience with pilots who have ejected 
from aircraft indicates medical attention often is necessary to 
treat broken bones and other injuries 
the shuttle duty is similar to normal rescue operations 
performed by the squadron but it did require development and 
acquisition of the motorized inflatable boats equipment long in 
the planning stage but stuck there until nasa requested assistance 
with the astronaut rescue system 
nasa for some reason raises peoples priorities in the air 
force behling said he said the motorized boats will improve the 
units overall rescue capability 
the 1730th has a long association with the space program 
the navy had primary responsibility for recovering space 
capsules that landed in the atlantic after their missions the 
1730th was on standby during those earlier flights and behling said 
at least twice air force pjs located astronaut crews from 
spacecraft that landed further than expected from navy ships

rebels in afghanistan sprayed rockets into the 
capital and one missile exploding near a downtown bus stop killed 
35 people and wounded more than 150 the tass news agency said 
wednesday 
the attack believed to be the deadliest ever by antimarxist 
insurgents on kabul was reported one day after soviet foreign 
minister eduard a shevardnadze told journalists the kremlin had 
halted its military withdrawal from afghanistan 
shevardnadze on wednesday cut short his participation in the 
un general assembly session in new york to return to moscow for 
what his spokesman gennady i gerasimov said was a meeting of the 
communist partys policymaking central committee 
it was not immediately known whether the committee would discuss 
the situation in afghanistan gerasimov said the meeting would make 
highlevel personnel changes and revamp the partys structure 
in its report from kabul tass said that in the space of one 
hour extremists fired 21 surfacetosurface rockets into the 
afghan capital it did not say what day the attack occurred 
one of the rockets exploded near a bus stop in the center of 
the city killing 35 and wounding another 156 civilians tass 
said 
tass said seven people were wounded in other parts of kabul 
over the past two days it said rebel rocket bombardments caused 
civilian casualties and widespread destruction in residential 
areas of the capitals of ghazni laghman nangarhar balkh paktia 
and parwan provinces and of khost district 
for months the soviets have accused pakistan of violating 
unbrokered accords on afghanistan by funneling arms including 
rockets to usbacked rebels battling the promoscow government 
of president najib 
the agreement obligates the soviets to withdraw their more than 
100000 troops from afghanistan by feb 15 
the soviets announced that half of their troops were back home 
by aug 15 in accordance with the agreement but on 
tuesdayshevardnadze told reporters at the united nations that the 
soviets have not begun the second stage of the pullout 
he did not say how the soviets would react if the alleged 
violations continue 
lets wait and see shevardnadze said it is necessary to 
stop the violations that take place it is the most important 
thing 
soviet media made no mention wednesday of shevardnadzes remarks 
or of a pause in the soviet pullout perhaps because of widespread 
hopes kindled in the country when the withdrawal began 
valentin falin head of the government press agency novosti 
told a reporter at a reception wednesday the pause was due to the 
actions of the other side he referred to us and pakistani arms 
supplies to the afghan rebels 
although the kremlins role in afghanistan was supported by many 
soviets an increased number had begun to regard the mounting 
soviet casualties as pointless by soviet count more than 13000 
soviet soldiers died in afghanistan 
in a speech to the general assembly earlier tuesday 
shevardnadze asked the five members of the un security council to 
discuss violations of the withdrawal agreement with afghanistan and 
pakistan 
he did not name pakistan but the soviet union has filed 
numerous complaints with the united nations saying that pakistan is 
allowing the usbacked insurgents to launch raids into 
afghanistan from bases in pakistan 
this cannot be allowed to happen shevardnadze said were 
not complaining to anyone we have the means to make things fall 
into place but we are responsible to the united nations and 
therefore are appealing to it 
pakistan has been a major backer of about 200000 
antigovernment guerrillas the united states and china have also 
given support to the rebels 
the soviets sent troops into afghanistan in 1979 and presided 
over the replacement of one marxist ruler by another they stayed 
on to fight a widespread insurgency and to prop up najibs 
government 
the withdrawal from afghanistan has been one of the tangible 
manifestations of gorbachevs more conciliatory foreign policy and 
soviets cite it as proof that their current leadership is seeking 
peaceful accommodation with the west 
in washington the state department said wednesday it expects 
soviet authorities will comply with their commitment to remove all 
soviet forces from afghanistan 
there is no reason why they should not meet this obligation 
and we expect the soviets to honor the obligations they undertook 
there is no evidence they will not do this deputy spokeswoman 
phyllis oakley said

nasa officials who have said since 
the challenger disaster that spaceflight will never be riskfree 
were asked on wednesday what would happen if there were another 
catastrophe 
i think the space program certainly will survive in any 
case deputy administrator dale d myers told reporters on the 
eve of discoverys flight 
weve done everything we know to make a safe flight out of 
this thing we are certainly aware there is risk in programs of 
this nature we think its a low enough risk that we are 
recognizing it and accepting that risk 
myers said it is inevitable that spaceflight will continue 
americans want to explore he said i think the world 
wants to explore a manned spaceflight program is the next frontier 
that man has always reached for i dont think there would be a 
secession of manned space flight 
but myers added i think there would be one heck of another 
investigation before we got under way again

a severely retarded prisoner is still on 
georgias death row 18 months after a state supreme court barred 
his execution 
his trial judge retired his attorneys went on to other matters 
and the prisoner johnny mack westbrook apparently fell through 
the cracks 
the whole thing sort of slipped my mind said joe briley 
district attorney for the ocmulgee circuit hes been in no 
danger of being executed his attorney and i have discussed how the 
resentencing would be handled but you know you get involved in 
other things and you just never get back to it 
westbrooks attorney charles mathis of milledgeville said he 
had discussed the case with briley i dont think i left him in 
the lurch mathis said recently 
psychologists say westbrook has an iq of 25 to 50 and a mental 
capacity of a child 3 to 8 years old 
defense attorneys argued that westbrook had followed another man 
in 1977 when the pair kidnapped and killed two women 
although briley admitted that westbrook was unfairly treated as 
a youth he served 20 years for stealing 300 worth of property 
the district attorney described the 1977 killings as among the 
cruelest things ive ever seen i think he ought to be executed 
a defense psychologist testified that people with westbrooks 
mentality never take social rules and apply them because 
their reasoning just isnt there 
the first conviction in 1977 was thrown out the jury in the 
second trial in 1985 recommended that westbrook be given life 
without parole 
judge joseph b duke of the ocmulgee judicial circuit rejected 
the verdict on the grounds that the jury could not consider parole 
the jury then returned a death sentence 
the state supreme court affirmed the convictions but ruled 18 
months ago that the initial recommendation of mercy blocked the 
death penalty 
briley has tentatively set westbrooks resentencing for oct 13

a navy diver who died on the 
tarmac of beirut airport after being shot on a hijacked plane was 
beaten so brutally that he was too weak to feed himself a witness 
testified wednesday 
elizabeth howes a flight attendant aboard twa flight 847 also 
told a court that one of the two gunmen who hijacked the jetliner 
terrorized passengers with a hand grenade and made them squeeze 
under the seats 
ms howes who testified at the trial of hijacker mohammed ali 
hamadi said she was shaken when she saw the condition of robert 
stethem who was later shot and thrown off the plane 
she said the beatings started shortly after the athenstorome 
flight was hijacked on june 14 1985 and continued intermittently 
until stethem was killed early the next day 
ms howes said another flight attendant uli derickson helped 
the 23yearold diver to the back of the plane after he was hit 
repeatedly with an iron bar 
i was very upset to see him and i used to be a nurse mrs 
derickson had to hold him by the arm support him so he could 
walk ms howes testified during hamadis murder and air piracy 
trial 
passenger clinton suggs testified earlier in the trial that he 
heard stetham scream and hamadi said let the pig suffer when 
derickson asked the hijackers if she could loosen stethems bound 
hands 
when the hijackers permitted the flight attendants to serve 
meals ms howes said she gave stethem a tray of food 
as i handed him the tray the australian girl sitting next to 
him said she would help him with the food ms howes said 
i said to him how are you doing and he just nodded he was 
so badly injured she said 
richard and patricia stethem the parents of the slain sailor 
from waldorf md have attended the trial since it began july 5 
the elder stethem took notes on wednesdays proceedings while his 
wife sat quietly nearby 
hamadi has admitted taking part in the hijacking during which 
39 americans were held captive for 17 days but denies involvement 
in stethems murder which he blames on the second hijacker 
hamadi was arrested at frankfurt airport on jan 13 1987 after 
customs officials discovered liquid explosives in his luggage 
on wednesday hamadi dressed in a shortsleeved sports shirt 
glanced at his translator whose lips could be seen moving rapidly 
as she related ms howes testimony to him in arabic for security 
reasons ms howes did not give her nationality or home address 
she said she feared hamadi less during the hijacking than a 
second terrorist on the airplane known to the passengers as said 
and identified in a us indictiment as hassan ezzeddine 
i believe i was more afraid of said he appeared to be more 
nervous especially with a hand grenade in his hand hamadi 
appeared to be more relaxed with the gun in his hand and did most 
of the negotiating said ms howes 
other witnesses have testified that hamadi had a gun just before 
and after stethem was shot and thrown onto the runway in beirut 
where the plane was forced to land 
hamadi was the first to go down the aisle and had a gun in 
his hand the other said had a hand grenade in one hand 
later they forced all to squeeze into the seats said with the 
hand grenade in his hand forcing people to get down on the floor 
beneath the seats said ms howes 
we were forced to put our heads between our knees those who 
didnt were hit on the head she said 
asked to comment on ms howes testimony hamadi said off the 
witness stand i have absolutely nothing to say 
on tuesday flight attendant hazel hesp said she did not believe 
hamadi killed stethem 
asked by chief judge heiner mueckenberger if she had an opinion 
about who killed stethem ms hesp said yes but i did not see 
the shot so it is only my opinion it would be my opinion that it 
would be said who shot 
ms hesp said she felt hamadi was taking orders from ezzeddine 
i think said ezzeddine was the leader he seemed to be 
giving the orders she said

the state department said wednesday it is 
disturbed by israels use of plastic bullets against palestinian 
demonstrators contending that the policy is leading to rising 
casualties in the occupied territories 
according to published reports at least three palestinians have 
been killed and 70 wounded since the israeli army began using 
plastic bullets a month ago the bullets have been described by 
their defenders as nonlethal 
we believe that measures must be taken to reduce rather than 
to increase casualties among palestinian demonstrators state 
department spokeswoman phyllis oakley said 
thus we are disturbed by the rising casualties of palestinians 
in recent clashes with the israeli military we can see no 
justification for a policy admittedly designed to cause an increase 
in casualties

city officials said they hope to prosecute 
two supporters of vice president george bush who were hosts at a 
party where college students allegedly chanted the pledge of 
allegiance too loudly 
mayor roy young jr said wednesday the city considers it just 
another of many excessivenoise cases it is pursuing this 
particular one is getting a whole lot of buildup but it happens to 
be one of 17 that were done that night young said 
though the city wants charges pressed william sherman an 
assistant butler county prosecutor obtained a twoweek delay of 
the case tuesday telling a judge his office wanted to further 
investigate the incident and determine whether it could be 
prosecuted 
karen stevens and kimberly mart the two miami university 
students cited said they were ready to defend themselves against 
the misdemeanor charge of exceeding the citys allowable noise 
level 
they scurried to court after distributing campaign buttons at a 
rally for bush who appeared on the miami university campus 
tuesday bush has made the pledge of allegiance a major campaign 
theme 
ms stevens 21 and ms mart 22 said police harassed them 
even though the women said they had taken precautions to hold down 
the noise 
the police went to the party at least twice the women said they 
came the first time because they were invited to come and take a 
noise reading to make sure the sound wasnt excessive 
the second time the police came they cited the two women after 
a guest standing on a trench holding iced beer kegs jokingly led 
other partygoers in the chant of the pledge of allegiance as the 
policemen measured the noise level 
it was a calm party ms mart said we really feel like we 
were picked on there were no complaints from neighbors the 
women said 
oxfords ordinance restricts acceptable noise levels to 70 
decibels most times and 55 decibels at night police said the noise 
level at the womens party reached 85 decibels

czechoslovakia on wednesday 
accused two british military attaches of spying and ordered them 
expelled britain said the move was in retaliation for londons 
expulsion of three czechoslovak diplomats last week 
the official news agency ctk said britains most senior diplomat 
in prague charge daffaires john macgregor was summoned to the 
czechoslovak foreign ministry and told that wing commander john 
maynard and warrant officer graham addy had 14 days to leave the 
country 
both men were guilty of activity incompatible with their 
diplomatic status ctk said using a phrase that in diplomatic 
parlance means espionage 
on sept 22 britain accused three diplomats at pragues embassy 
in london of spying and gave them 14 days to leave 
the three are czechoslovakias assistant military attache maj 
bedrich kramar air attache maj vlastimil netolicky and pavel 
moudry a member of the commercial section 
in london a foreign office spokesman denied that the britons 
ordered out of czechoslovakia were spies he said the move was 
definitely a retaliation for britains expulsion orders 
we have said we want to develop relations with czechoslovakia 
but the action of the three diplomats in london didnt help and 
this does not help either the spokesman told the associated 
press he spoke on condition of anonymity 
they the czechoslovakian authorities gave us the usual thing 
that these men were involved in the gathering of information of an 
intelligence nature said the spokesman 
he said maynard 54 has been posted in prague since may 1986 
and addy 36 since june 1986 both men are married and each has 
three children 
as britain did last week czechoslovakia emphasized that it 
wanted to build better bilateral relations but said the alleged 
espionage is an obstacle according to ctk 
wednesdays expulsions brought to seven the number of 
czechoslovak diplomats that britain has ordered out since 1983 two 
were expelled in 1983 and two more in 1984 that year 
czecholsovakia expelled two britons in an apparent reprisal

the daily telegraph conservative london misgivings about 
dukakis capacity in international affairs are widespread the 
british people have had no opportunity to assess him because he has 
never visited london paris or bonn so little interest in our 
concerns is bound to be unnerving he is currently trying to 
cultivate an image of greater toughness but it will take more than 
a snapshot of dukakis in a tank to dispel the impression of a man 
with a strong disinclination to using force and who appears to 
believe that international affairs can be regulated by moral 
imperatives and consensus management 
as he demonstrated in the television contest mr bush is both 
less articulate and less managerialminded than his opponent but 
from a european point of view he has more substantial advantages 
he knows us and our problems and has seen enough of the world not 
to expect too much of it europe has no vote but is entitled to

george bush has repeatedly charged gov michael dukakis with 
ducking the ideological issue while mr reagan constantly 
invokes the dreaded l word liberal to fend off the democrats 
drive for the political middle ground 
we suspect that the republicans have got it wrong because at 
least to our eyes it is precisely the gops liberalism that has 
kept the republicans in power for eight years and may keep mr bush 
in the white house for the next eight 
the word liberal of course relates to freedom and the economic 
liberal is one who believes in free trade and the market principle 
protectionists on the other hand tend to be nationalists keen to

asahi shimbun liberalleaning we were disappointed that 
the debate gave only limited time to questions on world trade and 
americas asian policy 
customarily a tv debate is not an occasion for candidates to 
announce their new policies and what they say depends of course 
on the questions they are asked but the impression we got of the 
bushdukakis debate is that the position of the united states in

we hope the next debate will take up japanus relations and

the movers and shakers in the world of plumbing 
and wastewater treatment celebrated the opening wednesday of a new 
museum exhibit illustrating the plumbers role as guardian of the 
nations health 
the average person flushes the closet and they dont know 
what happens to the water they dont realize whats all involved 
in plumbing said william reichert chairman of the chicago 
plumbing council 
our motto is the plumbers protect the health of the nation 
the doctors take care of it but we protect it said reichert 
who began as an apprentice plumber in 1926 and now is president of 
a local plumbing and heating company 
about 200 people many of them plumbing contractors plumbing 
inspectors or plumbing engineers crowded into the new 
2200squarefoot exhibit at chicagos museum of science and 
industry 
the exhibit illustrates the flow of water in the chicago area 
from lake michigan through treatment plants into the home out the 
toilet and into sewage treatment plants 
instead of the traditional ribboncutting mayor eugene sawyer 
did the honors at a pipecutting ceremony working up a sweat 
slicing the pipe as some of the plumbers wives snapped pictures 
ive just earned my plumbing union card again sawyer 
quipped i used to be a member of the plumbers union because i 
started out in the water department as a chemist 
i understand how important it is that we in chicago have clean 
water the mayor said 
reichert proudly showing off the exhibit said it was a tribute 
to the plumbers role in modern society 
the first section features seven animated transparencies showing 
how the citys water system provides more than 1 billion gallons of 
water daily to more than 7 million people 
the next section a series of fullscale cutaway rooms in a 
house features glass pipes instead of steel or cast iron showing 
how water flows through the kitchen bathroom and laundry room 
when you flush the closet it shows how the closet works and 
where the water goes reichert said its interesting if you 
have kids you can bring them down and show them 
he pointed to a bend inside the bottom of the toilet just 
before the point where the water flows out and noted thats where 
most blockages occur 
reichert paused before a glass display case containing a fat 
twofoot chunk of weathered wood 
way back in chicago in the 1800s we had wooden water mains 
when they dug the subway they uncovered some of these he said 
and heres an oldtime closet with a wooden tank like they had 
way back when reichert said pointing out an older model of 
toilet 
the final section of the exhibit is a walkthrough theater 
describing the history and wastewater treatment responsibilities of 
the metropolitan sanitary district of chicago 
frank mucha of chicago a museum visitor was among the first to 
view the new exhibit 
i think its very nice its interesting and educational 
mucha confessed hed never given much thought to what happens 
when the commode is flushed 
i never paid any attention to it in the past i had no idea 
what happened

the federal government is becoming a 
frustrating place to work where salaries are low prestige is 
falling offices are seedy and workers are subjected to 
humiliating experiences and sapped of initiative according to a 
study ordered by congress 
as a result the study says at the very time the work is 
becoming increasingly complicated and technical the government is 
losing its ability to attract qualified employees and it is left 
with what some have suggested only half jokingly is the best of 
the desperate the report said 
the federal government faces a slowly emerging crisis of 
competence concludes the study which was conducted for the 
office of personnel management by the hudson institute a 
conservative think tank after congress directed that opm look into 
the longterm work force needs of the federal government 
opm director constance horner submitting the report tuesday 
urged congress to pay attention for without a strong and well 
qualified civil service we endanger the democracy which it serves 
the report said the governments ability to recruit and retain 
the best already has deteriorated 
it said applicants score lower in civil service exams than they 
did in the 1970s the number of graduates of schools of public 
administration entering federal service has dropped 25 percent 
since 1979 the irs hires accountants from the 54th percentile of 
the national certified public accountant exam compared to 
candidates from the 86th percentile hired by the major national 
accounting firms and at some veterans administration hospitals 
intensive care beds are unavailable because of a shortage of nurses 
the report cited these factors for those conditions 
pay it quoted a study which said federal workers on average 
get 24 percent less than comparable workers in the private 
workforce in highwage areas and highranking jobs the federal 
wage disadvantage is even greater it said 
esteem over the years candidates who campaigned for office by 
running against washington have changed the public view of 
government work into a mood of outright disdain and hostility 
it said and as a result fewer of the most talented individuals 
have entered government service 
needless aggravations among them limited advancement 
opportunities poor working conditions random drug testing even 
for those who are not suspected of drug use the practice of 
monitoring phone calls to check for personal calls and federal 
offices that are drab or even seedy 
in addition federal workers often see that unproductive 
employees are retained while those making extra efforts are not 
always rewarded the report said 
regardless of the attitudes they bring with them to 
government many federal workers soon come to believe that energy 
initiative and risktaking are less valued behaviors than going by 
the book and staying out of trouble it added 
the hudson institute is headed by mitchel e daniels former 
political director in the reagan white house the chief author of 
the report william b johnston was associate director of the 
domestic policy staff in the carter white house

a third body was found wednesday buried 
in the rubble of a sixstory condominium that collapsed and slid 
down a steep hillside residents said the building had been unsafe 
for months 
the complex built on six cement pillars collapsed shortly 
before 9 am tuesday in a fashionable suburb of monterrey killing 
a man and his baby son and a woman 
a 19monthold girl and two women were missing 
luis carlos trevino berchelman assistant attorney general in 
this northern nuevo leon state capital said rescue crews found the 
womans body wednesday but couldnt retrieve it because it was 
under heavy concrete slabs 
state authorities at the scene speculate that heavy rain from 
hurricane gilbert which ripped through the area sept 17 
contributed to the structures collapse 
one of the neighbors told us that six months ago they told the 
architect that the building was breaking loose and it was 
leaning said francisco javier nakashima state judicial police 
investigator 
asked if gilberts torrential rains contributed to the collapse 
nakashima said it had to have something to do with it so all 
this accelerated 
residents and their relatives say the building already was 
unsafe 
we knew this was going to happen resident marcela garza 
told the daily monterrey newspaper el norte 
the whole building had cracks and the frames were crooked 
said ms garza who was away from the condominium when it fell 
patrick fiehn uncle of the 19monthold girl trapped inside 
said in an interview that the buildings support pillars had been 
twisting for several months he said an engineer hired to examine 
the building just three days before the disaster told residents it 
was safe 
state and local authorities at the scene said they would not 
investigate the cause of the collapse until all the victims were 
found 
rescue teams working around the clock since the disaster dug by 
hand and carried out buckets of broken concrete that had been the 
buildings walls and floors 
we were advised to do the work by hand the goal is to 
preserve the life of those that may be inside trevino berchelman 
said 
he said three teams of dogs that had been brought in to sniff 
through the rubble including an american group from dallas all 
pinpointed about the same locations where the victims may be 
trapped 
but he said the heavy concrete slabs prevented rescue workers 
from reaching those locations 
three people were rescued shortly after the structure collapsed 
and did not suffer major injuries 
a fourth survivor maria eugenia gonzalez de rodriguez was 
dragged from the wreckage four hours after the building fell she 
was listed in stable condition wednesday at monterreys muguerza 
hospital said rebecca gonzalez a nurse on the intermediate care 
ward 
the 3yearold building had 21 residents and one supervisor but 
only 10 people were inside the building when it fell

in choosing a man unpopular with 
solidarity to be prime minister gen wojciech jaruzelski has 
signaled that authorities are not about to roll over and play dead 
in talks with the opposition 
but naming propaganda chief mieczyslaw rakowski to head the 
government may not be as harmful to chances for achieving national 
reconciliation as it initially appeared 
the selection of rakowski at a time when authorities have set 
aside their longstanding opposition to direct talks with leaders of 
the banned free trade union movement raised some eyebrows in this 
capital city 
after all rakowski and solidarity chairman lech walesa have had 
a long and bitter relationship according to acquaintances both 
thoroughly dislike each other 
rakowski then deputy prime minister was the governments point 
man in dealing with solidarity during its 15month legal period 
which ended in december 1981 with the imposition of martial law 
solidarity activists accuse the government of bad faith during 
the period while communist authorities say solidarity leaders were 
unable to control their rankandfile bringing the country to the 
edge of anarchy 
the bitter feelings were not helped after martial law when 
rakowski continued to defend the decision to crack down on 
solidarity he went so far as to challenge walesa on his home turf 
the lenin shipyard in gdansk in a dramatic televised verbal 
encounter 
taking all this into account promoting rakowski will give pause 
to solidarity activists who believed that roundtable talks 
beginning in midoctober would quickly lead to reinstatement of the 
union 
some people allied with the authorities have complained that the 
opposition has been too quick to assume that the governments 
agreement to hold talks means solidarity already has won 
by agreeing on the talks authorities succeeded in ending a 
polands most serious strike wave in seven years 
walesa has said publicly that recognition of solidarity is 
very near and another activist told western reporters that 
interior minister gen czeslaw kiszczak had already conceded a 
place for solidarity in polands future 
such statements are signs of wishful thinking on the part 
of the opposition said party journalist daniel passent who added 
that he doubts authorities are ready to recognize solidarity 
but naming rakowski to the prime ministers post does not 
automatically doom roundtable talks several political figures 
said 
it doesnt matter said walesa its a new situation 
maybe he will change his opinion about solidarity said 
independent parliament deputy ryszard bender 
in addition the roundtable talks will be conducted by someone 
other than rakowski who will have his hands full assembling a new 
governing team and coping with polands disintegrating economy 
in the three preparatory talks so far kiszczak has taken the 
lead for the government and participants said he has shown a good 
rapport with walesa 
in addition there are signs that rakowski who until the rise 
of solidarity was considered a leading liberal within the communist 
party would like to be seen again as a reformer who will bring 
greater diversity to polish government 
he told the parliament after his election that he wanted to 
bring people who backed reform into the government later 
government spokesman jerzy urban said members of the constructive 
opposition might be invited to join the authorities 
recently also rakowski has tempered his criticism of walesa 
saying the solidarity leader may have matured in recent years 
finally there remained the possibility that rakowskis tenure 
in office could be brief 
some party observers had said before his appointment that the 
next government could be transitional pending whatever agreement 
on the future government in poland is reached by the talks with 
solidarity and urban said rakowski was expected to stay until 
parliamentary elections sometime next year

the american civil liberties union with a list 
of causes running the political spectrum from the black panthers to 
lt col oliver north is somewhat bewildered to find itself at the 
center of the presidential campaign 
almost every day republican george bush criticizes his 
democratic rival as a cardcarrying member of the aclu my 
values are your values and they are not the values of the aclu 
bush told a rally on monday 
even the cardcarrying member michael dukakis has backed away 
from the group as bushs relentless criticism apparently strikes a 
chord with voters to the dismay of aclu officials the dukakis 
campaign released a list of issues on which the massachusetts 
governor differs with the group 
throughout its 68year history the group has been associated 
primarily with the left although it has come to the defense of 
clients that span the ideological spectrum from the communist 
party to the nazi party from the ku klux klan to the black 
panthers it was founded in 1920 the outgrowth of an organization 
formed to oppose us involvement in world war i and to support the 
rights of critics to speak out against the war 
you know we dont choose our clients said ira glasser the 
groups executive director if we are representing more people on 
the left its because the government is prosecuting more people on 
the left 
among those it has jumped to the defense of recently are former 
white house aides north and lyn nofziger the aclu also has 
supported in recent years the national rifle association and the 
national conservative political action committee 
most people dont associate the aclu with those causes of 
course and public education director colleen oconnor conceded 
that her role is a relatively new mission of the group she 
conceded that the aclu needs to do a better job of getting its 
message out 
if ever there was proof of it its been in the past few 
months she said 
we dont expect mr dukakis to guide his campaign by our 
agenda nor should we guide ours by his she said but our 
concern in all this is that he not fall into the trap that bush has 
laid for the aclu in suggesting that our organization is out of 
the mainstream in most of our positions 
that of course is precisely the point that the bush campaign 
has tried to make in a speech earlier this week republican vice 
presidential candidate dan quayle called on dukakis to renounce 
all their bizarre positions 
the positions most frequently cited are those on child 
pornography tax exemptions for churches decriminalization of 
drugs and prostitution and support for abortion and gay rights 
for the most part aclu officials dont deny that the 
organization holds the positions for which it is attacked 
it opposes all censorship maintaining that even child 
pornography is protected by the first amendment however officials 
stress that they favor laws that preclude the exploitation of 
children for pornography 
it opposes tax exemptions for churches on the basis that they 
amount to government subsidization of religion internally one of 
the organizations most controversial stands 
it favors the decriminalization of drugs and prostitution as 
victimless activities and it strongly supports gay rights and a 
womans right to choose an abortion 
aclu officials complain however that conservatives have 
handpicked a few of the groups most controversial positions and 
ignored the others 
we take positions on hundreds of issues and it would be real 
unusual if anybody agreed with all of them said glasser in 
fact i think its fair to say that i dont agree with all of 
them 
glasser decried the basically uninformed and mccarthyite 
flavor of the bush attacks while stressing that the aclu is 
nonpartisan and will not take sides in the presidential race 
it will however strike back at bush aclu leaders are busy 
readying newspaper advertisements speeches and the groups first 
television commercials one commercial will feature burt lancaster 
declaring i am a cardcarrying member of the aclu 
the phrase in fact seems to have gained a certain cachet in 
aclu circles ms oconnor said hundreds of people have written the 
group in recent weeks to ask if they too can be a cardcarrying 
member of the aclu

a snag in efforts to settle a 
dispute over a 350 million trust left by auto magnate henry ford 
ii has been worked out with the appointment of a guardian to 
represent his minor grandchildren 
attorneys for kathleen duross ford 48 widow of the ford motor 
co heir at first objected to another attorneys insistence of a 
guardian calling it a lastminute stall tactic 
but they later agreed tuesday to the appointment of retired palm 
beach circuit judge robert s hewitt 71 as guardian of the four 
minor grandchildren and any unborn grandchildren residuary 
beneficiaries of the trust 
the minors will benefit after the death of mrs ford who is 
entitled to receive a minimum of 15 million a year from the 
trust plus any income derived from investments 
in another ford family matter a hearing was scheduled wednesday 
in palm beach county circuit court on a motion to dismiss cristina 
fords 54 million alimony claim ford divorced cristina his 
second wife in 1980 and she claims she has been cut off since his 
death not receiving any money from fords estate 
ford who died sept 29 1987 took control of ford motor co in 
1945 from his grandfather auto pioneer henry ford 
provisions of the confidential trust became public when mrs 
ford filed a lawsuit challenging the administration of the trust 
she and fords son edsel b ford ii had disagreed over whether 
the trust should pay 1 million a year to william donaldson an old 
friend of henry fords and the third trustee to manage the money 
they also disagreed over which attorney would be counsel for the 
trust and how the money should be invested 
the trustees 14 attorneys were in court monday ready to settle 
the lawsuit and avoid the publicity a trial would generatebut the 
agreement began to unravel when james weber attorney for fords 
grandchildren said a guardian was needed 
judge vaughn rudnick who must approve any agreement refused to 
approve it without webers consent

call it the washandwear wristwatch 
its a batteryoperated digital watch that wont work unless 
its been dipped in a glass of water held under a faucet or soaked 
some other way and its name is to the point water watch 
why would someone want a watch that needs to be watered 
initially we think the novelty will be the appeal said 
andrew wroblewski whose company devereux ltd owns the worldwide 
distribution rights for the watch 
the 27yearold rochester resident said wednesday wearers of the 
watch should have fun with it 
he envisions people ordering a separate glass of water at a 
restaurant for their watch hanging their watch out the window at 
the car wash or taking off their clothes and strapping on their 
watch to take a shower 
the watch which sells for 1995 was created by a hong kong 
businessman and is manufactured in his factory he has requested to 
remain anonymous wroblewski said 
if the watches are successful wroblewski said his company also 
has the distribution rights to a water calculator and a water 
clock radio 
the watch has three small holes on the side to take in water and 
after its been drenched it will display the time and date without 
a refill for about a month depending on the humidity 
although the watchs package touts it as a new hitech 
product the watch actually uses simple battery technology 
the battery in the watch works much like an automobile battery 
that needs to be filled with liquid in order to activate a dry 
electrolyte that allows electrical current to flow through the 
battery 
wroblewski said his company hopes to sell 500000 watches a 
month beginning in october 
wroblewski said he doesnt think the watch will be a fad this 
is not just like the hula hoop or the yoyo this is useful so we 
think it will find other markets

private economists reacted with skepticism 
wednesday to george bushs proposal for new taxdeferred savings 
accounts for the middle class 
democrat michael dukakis was already using the proposal as 
ammunition for his contention that a bush presidency would favor 
the rich however republican bush defended his plan to set up 
individual savings accounts saying they would give taxpayers 
a little nest egg 
many private economists called the tax savings inconsequential 
and said it was unlikely such accounts would be used by very many 
americans 
the vice presidents proposal which he first described on 
tuesday would allow people to deposit up to 1000 annually in a 
special savings account and defer taxes on the interest if the 
money was kept in the account for a minimum of five years 
while the interest would accumulate tax free during that time 
it would be taxed at the savers regular tax rate once it was 
withdrawn 
that would mean that the only benefit to the taxpayer would come 
from additional interest earned on money that would otherwise be 
taxed immediately 
the amount of the benefit would depend on whether the taxpayer 
was being taxed at a 15 percent or 28 percent rate and how much his 
investment was earning 
michael boskin a stanford economist and a top bush economic 
adviser said that a taxpayer being taxed at a 28 percent top rate 
who put 1000 into the special savings accounts every year for 10 
years would accumulate about 500 in tax savings at the end of 10 
years this assumes that the investments earned 10 percent annually 
boskin called the plan a modest additional proposal and said 
it should be viewed as complementing other savings incentives such 
as existing individual retirement accounts and bushs proposal for 
college savings bonds in which the income from the bonds would be 
tax free if it went to college tuition 
but other economists said the modest benefits the bush campaign 
was claiming would be even less when the savings were invested for 
a shorter period of time or at lower interest rates 
this is an attempt to help the middle and lower economic 
classes save more money but it is small potatoes and it is 
questionable as to whether it will produce much of anything at 
all said allen sinai chief economist of the boston co 
the economists all said that boosting americans low savings 
rates was a worthy goal since that would free more money for 
investment in areas to boost the countrys productivity but they 
said this plan was unlikely to have much effect they said a much 
better approach would be to cut the federal budget deficits which 
would also free money for investment 
we have implemented a slew of savings incentives in the past 
several years and yet personal savings rates remain at record 
lows said lawrence chimerine president of the wefa group an 
economic consulting firm in bala cynwyd pa one reason people 
arent saving more is that they feel they cant because their 
living standards are already being squeezed 
several economists noted that dukakis had already seized on the 
disparity between bushs plan for middle class savers and the vice 
presidents proposal to cut the capital gains tax rate from the 
current 33 percent maximum down to 15 percent dukakis said the 
capital gains cut would mean an average 30000 windfall for the 
wealthiest 1 percent of americans 
george bush plays santa claus to the wealthy and ebenezer 
scrooge to the rest of us dukakis said wednesday as he waved a 
20 bill which he said represented the amount the average family 
would save with the bush accounts 
robert reischauer an economist at the brookings institution who 
advises dukakis said that someone with a moderate income taxed at 
a 15 percent rate putting 1000 in the bush account per year 
would realize total tax savings of 944 for each 1000 invested 
that saving would go to 1477 per 1000 for someone taxed at a 
28 percent tax rate reischauer assumes the investments would earn 
8 percent interest per year 
david wyss an economist at data resources inc a lexington 
mass economic consulting firm called the tax savings trivial 
i think he needed to come up with some kind of tax break for 
the middle class to balance the freebies he wants to give the rich 
with the lower capital gains tax wyss said 
but john makin an economist with the conservative american 
enterprise institute said that the bush proposal would be more 
attractive for people willing to leave their investments alone for 
longer periods 
its better than nothing but its not going to change the 
world dramatically makin said and its going to look a lot 
less attractive if you are talking five years of contributions 
and a 15 percent tax bracket

the current pentagon bribery investigation 
arises from plain criminal greed that is a sad aspect of 
life former defense secretary caspar weinberger said wednesday 
i dont believe theres anything special about the navy or 
the defense department or this situation the architect of 
president reagans defense buildup told the house armed services 
committee 
before resigning last year weinberger oversaw a doubling of the 
pentagon budget under reagan and a large increase in the pentagons 
purchase of a vast array of weapons and other items 
the justice department is investigating whether private 
consultants many of them former pentagon employees paid bribes to 
defense department officials for inside information about 
contracts chiefly within the navy such information could be the 
difference in winning multimilliondollar contracts 
no charges have been filed 
weinberger said he didnt know any of the inside details of the 
investigation and was not aware it was under way until there were 
news reports in june about the serving of subpoenas 
thats the first i heard of it he told the panel every 
once in a while before that oh youd come across an isolated case 
here and there but there was nothing systematic nothing of this 
scale until i read about the investigation 
weinberger steadfastly defended his tenure at the pentagon and 
said he and other top defense department officials had worked hard 
to root out corruption and fraud 
but rep les aspin dwis chairman of the panel asked 
weinberger why did this happen is it the system why now 
i dont know weinberger said as to why i suspect the 
simple answer is plain criminal greed it goes back to biblical 
times thats a sad aspect of life 
this socalled insider trading of information is just greed 
he continued i dont know of anything in the system that 
requires or breeds dishonesty but dishonesty is a sad fact of 
daily existence 
he did endorse restrictions on the use of consultants 
a lot of these consulting services are unnecessary he 
said i have moral problems with these 
several legislators have proposed new restrictions on the 
pentagons use of consultants but weinberger declined to endorse 
any specific proposals 
he did say the best way to restrict consultants is to have 
very strict rules and regulations with respect to reimbursement of 
contractors if the companies hire consultants 
the companies should be required to show that the consultants 
are necessary to fulfilling the contract before the consultant fees 
are reimbursed by the pentagon weinberger suggested 
weinberger called for firm oversight by both the pentagon 
and congress but again as he has in the past he criticized 
congress for being involved too deeply in details of weapons 
systems and contracts 
he also said he had ordered sharp increases in the number of 
auditors during reagans first term a time when defense budgets 
were rising steadily 
we got a lot of criticism for overauditing but it seems to 
me its better than underauditing he said 
it was the pentagon rather than its critics which uncovered 
many of the horror stories such as 600 toilet seat covers 
weinberger said 
all of those were uncovered by our own auditors he said 
and it needs to be remembered that we didnt pay them we caught 
them

the united states has reached a historic 
agreement to import chinese breeding swine in hopes of upgrading 
american pork supplies the agriculture department said wednesday 
deputy secretary peter c myers said the contract involves 
usdas agricultural service chinas ministry of agriculture and 
the chinese national animal breeding stock import and export corp 
the imports will include 144 pigs of the meishan ming and 
fengjing breeds he said the animals will be used in research 
studies under a cooperative agreement with the usdas meat animal 
research laboratory at clay center neb the university of 
illinois and iowa state university 
myers a hog farmer from missouri said he talked about the 
potential agreement during his june 1987 visit to china he said 
china has about 100 breeds of swine that represent a unique 
reservoir of unexplored germplasm that could offer potential 
benefits for the us industry 
this unexploited source could prove to be very valuable to 
the us research programs on resistance to diseases parasites and 
improvement of some production traits he said china has a 
long history in the domestication of pigs that can be traced back 
for at least 6000 years 
according to usda reports china also is the worlds largest hog 
producer at the end of 1983 for example china had an inventory 
of 2985 million hogs compared with 558 million for the united 
states at that time 
a department spokeswoman sandy miller hays said she did not 
know and could not find out immediately how much the pigs cost the 
united states or whether there might be other terms involved 
a goal of the import program is to cross the chinese breeds with 
us breeds to increase litter size while maintaining the quality 
and lean yield of pork the breeds being imported have three to 
four more pigs per litter than the average us breed 
the animals will be imported in late march 1989 after spending 
60 days in quarantine in china and meeting other health 
requirements they will be quarantined again for 120 days at usdas 
animal import center in fleming key fla before being released 
for research 
roger j gerrits of the departments agricultural research 
service said scientists hope to conduct at least five years of 
research to evaluate the animals and determine if they should be 
released for use by the us swine industry 
gerrits said that us swine geneticists recognized the 
potential value of chinese swine more than 10 years ago but 
satisfactory health and quarantine requirements were not 
completed until last year 
the three breeds selected for the research studies are highly 
prolific he said us geneticists estimate it would take at 
least 30 generations of conventional selection to increase the 
litter size of the average us swine breed to the level routinely 
produced by these chinese breeds 
each university and the usda agency will conduct its own 
research program but projects at each will be coordinated gerrits 
said provisions also have been made for the exchange and sharing of 
germplasm semen and other genetic material in case of a disease 
outbreak or other unexpected losses

prime minister david lange of new zealand said 
wednesday that strained relations between his government and the 
united states have kept him from visiting the white house even 
though all sorts of hoods go there 
lange in the united states for a speech to the un general 
assembly told abctvs good morning america the new zealand 
government was firm in its refusal to allow us nucleararmed 
ships to visit ports in his country 
the ban led the united states to end its alliance with new 
zealand 
if that means you take your army and air force and navy away 
thats bad we regret it lange said but the price of being 
defeated by a nuclear devastation is something were not prepared 
to pay 
he was asked what that meant for relations between the two 
countries 
it means that i dont sort of get taken to the white house 
lange said ive been to disneyland four times new york about 
three times in the last four years and ive never been to the 
white house 
and all sorts of hoods have been to the white house in that 
time he said without elaborating 
white house spokesman marlin fitzwater declined to comment when 
asked about the remark 
but its an easy practical relationship lange said we 
get along well with the united states we look at the world through 
your news cameras

president reagan laughed when he was asked 
about prospects for winning the nobel peace prize but aides in the 
white house had their fingers crossed in hopes thursdays award 
will cement the presidents place in history as a peacemaker 
im superstitious since one hand is crossed the other one 
cant be because it would cancel the other out quipped nancy 
reagans spokeswoman elaine crispen 
reagan and soviet leader mikhail s gorbachev have been 
mentioned as top contenders for the 390000 prize because of their 
efforts in reaching the first superpower treaty banning an entire 
class of nuclear weapons according to the nobel committee in oslo 
which will announce the winner thursday 97 individuals and 
organizations were candidates for the peace prize this year 
the first lady long has been rumored to be the white house 
resident most interested in seeing her husband crown his eightyear 
presidency with one of the worlds most prestigious awards 
but mrs crispen poohpoohed the idea that mrs reagan was 
anxious for her husband to receive the golden medal saying the 
first ladys never said a word about it and even if such an 
honor didnt come his way the couple wouldnt be disappointed 
mrs crispen predicted 
going through elections and such theyre always set for 
things to go one way or another they are very realistic about 
winning and losing she said 
when reporters queried reagan about his prospects last week 
during a visit by soviet foreign minister eduard a shevardnadze 
the president and his visitor broke out in big smiles and laughed 
while reagan said nothing shevardnadze quipped that it might be 
a good possibility that his soviet boss and reagan might meet 
once again if they were to go to oslo to receive the award 
white house spokesman marlin fitzwater said no one in the 
executive mansion has had any advance information on the 
announcement 
no one knows what will happen its not the sort of thing you 
can anticipate but it would be wonderful for the president if he 
won fitzwater said 
if reagan were to win hed be the third us president to do so 
president theodore roosevelt was the first american to win the 
award receiving it in 1906 for his diplomacy in ending the 
conflict between russia and japan 
president woodrow wilson was granted the medallion for his 
peacemaking efforts involving the league of nations after world war 
i 
any chief executive is reminded of the benchmark set by earlier 
presidents since roosevelts medal is on display across the hall 
from the oval office in the roosevelt room 
the 2inch golden medallion encased in a 14inch high 
plexiglass cube shimmers in a special spotlight on the mantel for 
all to see 
wilsons medal is now in the possession of the library of 
congress and will be placed on display at the woodrow wilson house 
in november and december in observance of armistice day 
wilsons prize was bestowed in 1920 after he failed to win us 
support for his beloved league of nations and he felt very 
vindicated by the peace prize said patricia sullivan the 
director of the museum at the wilson house 
the washington mansion was where the gravely ill president spent 
his last days in virtual seclusion 
some think reagan doesnt deserve the prize because of his 
support for the nicaraguan contras in their war against the 
sandinista government 
and roosevelt in his time was viewed by many as the antithesis 
of the peacemaker 
the prize seems somewhat anomalous inasmuch as it was awarded 
to an outspoken advocate of armed force and a scourge of 
pacifism wrote john milton cooper jr in his study of roosevelt 
and wilson the warrior and the priest 
yet it was not anomalous the policies roosevelt pursued in 
the far east and europe were aimed at averting or containing 
conflicts among the great powers and promoting international 
stability behind both the appearance and the reality of his public 
stances the president lead an almost secret life as a sensitive 
subtle diplomat cooper said

research into the growing and use of kenaf a 
fibrous plant that can be used to make paper is getting more 
attention after a decade on the back burner the agriculture 
department said wednesday 
howard e waterworth coordinator of kenaf research for usdas 
agricultural research service said 300000 is being invested this 
year in kenaf studies through agency laboratories in lane okla 
and weslaco texas another 300000 is scheduled for 1989 
industry trials including test runs by several us 
newspapers indicate that pulp from kenaf makes newsprint paper 
that is as sturdy as woodpulp paper but generally is brighter 
consumes less ink and has less ink ruboff waterworth said 
kenaf can be grown in southern us areas such as texas 
florida georgia mississippi and california he said the plants 
grow 15 to 18 feet in height in less than five months and can grow 
to around 22 feet an acre yields 7 to 10 tons of dry fiber 
the peoria ill journalstar in 1977 was the first newspaper 
to make a press run on kenaf newsprint at least eight other 
newspapers have had similar tests including the most recent in 
july 1987 at the bakerfield californian 
agency research on kenaf was suspended in 1978 when supplies of 
paper pulp were plentiful and prices were down waterworth said 
the usda has spent about 900000 to support commercial 
development of kenaf through private industry since 1986 and the 
new funds for research are expected to give additional support 
to that enterprise he said

a mexican drug trafficker was found guilty 
wednesday of aiding and abetting the 1985 torture murder of a us 
drug agent and his pilot he was the third man convicted in the 
case which strained usmexican relations 
jesus felix gutierrez 38 was found guilty by a federal jury of 
helping mexican drug baron rafael caro quintero escape to costa 
rica after the brutal 1985 murder of drug enforcement 
administration agent enrique camarena and his pilot alfredo zavala 
avelar 
felixs attorney had contended there was insufficent evidence to 
convict the former los angeles seafood store owner and suggested 
the government altered evidence 
the key evidence against felix was the testimony of a government 
informant who said he heard the defendant discuss his role in 
arranging caros escape prosecutors also showed jurors entries on 
felixs passport indicating he had preceded caro to costa rica and 
left after caro arrived 
earlier jurors convicted renee verdugo uruidez 36 and raul 
lopez alvarez 28 of conspiring and participating in the 
kidnapmurders of camarena and zavala 
verdugo who was said to be caros chief lieutenant in a 
multimilliondollar marijuana smuggling ring and lopez a former 
member of the mexican state police face possible life imprisonment 
lopez is to be sentenced oct 24 and verdugos sentencing is 
set for oct 26 
felix who is serving time on a cocaine trafficking conviction 
faces a possible maximum of 10 years in prison 
the battered bodies of camarena and his pilot were found buried 
at a remote ranch outside guadalajara on march 5 1985 camarena 
had been kidnapped outside the us consulate in guadalajara on 
feb 7 1985 
evidence showed the agent and pilot were tortured with redhot 
metal pipes and beaten so severely that camarenas skull was 
crushed 
prosecutors theorized the killings were retribution for dea 
raids on caros marijuana plantations 
attorneys for the three defendants said they were scapegoats 
used by the mexican and american governments to close an 
embarrassing internationally sensitive case 
nine men were indicted in los angeles but only three were tried 
here one defendant died four including caro were tried in 
mexico on narcotics and murder charges 
caro 37 and ernesto fonseca carrillo63 were convicted last 
week in mexico on narcotics and weapons charges caro was sentenced 
to 34 years and fonseca 11 years verdicts have not yet been 
reached on some of the mexican charges including the murder charges

a strikeplagued new england freight rail line 
hired plainly unqualified replacement engineers while strikers 
engaged in a campaign of intimidation and sabotage the federal 
railroad administration said wednesday 
the 44page report harshly criticized both management and labor 
at guilford transportation industries where workers went on strike 
nov 12 1987 following an accident at a lawrence mass freight 
yard that killed a conductor strikers returned to work this summer 
after a federal arbitration board ruled in their favor 
both management and those opposing managements position have 
demonstrated their willingness to compromise both work place and 
public safety when their economic interests are at stake the fra 
report said 
labor and management were willing to use the safety issue as 
leverage to achieve their objectives 
the agency disagreed with the unions contentions that there 
were safety problems before the strike but the report said 
engineers hired to replace striking workers were recruited from 
any available source in disregard of sound safety practice and 
simple common sense 
the result was an engineer force that resembled a patchwork 
quilt with engineers ranging from qualified to plainly 
unqualified the company was willing to compromise public safety to 
achieve its economic objective 
the union meanwhile waged what amounted to a campaign of 
intimidation against the carrier and its replacement employees 
the report said 
the fra cited more than 100 incidents of slashed air brake hoses 
plus derailments caused by objects placed on guilford tracks bear 
traps were once set where replacement employees were expected to 
walk the next shift 
whatever their economic differences may be it is essential 
that both sides keep safety separate from their ongoing economic 
disputes and make a common commitment to observe sound safety 
practices even when they are in conflict with the parties 
shortterm economic objectives the fra said 
michael maloof chairman of the united transportation union 
said he had not seen the fra report but denounced it and called 
fra administrator john reilly antiunion 
guilford vice president colin pease also lambasted the report 
saying it politicizes the process 
at no time did this railroad put employees to work who were 
unqualified when the strike began we dramatically curtailed our 
service because we did not have sufficient employees pease said 
there is no issue more important to the management of this 
railroad than safety 
the fra concluded that working conditions were safe when the 
union went on strike last year in connection with safety issues 
that conclusion differs sharply from a federal arbitration board 
ruling in june that said the strike was legitimate because of 
unsafe rail conditions 
the company was ordered to reinstate the workers and pay 
millions in back pay guilford officials are appealing that 
decision but have rehired the workers 
in february the fra announced 734900 in fines against 
guilford for a variety of safety violations

the presidents chief economic adviser said 
wednesday that slowing economic growth in the second half of the 
year should ease inflationary pressures and help bring down 
interest rates 
beryl sprinkel chairman of the presidents council of economic 
advisers said he expected overall economic growth would drop below 
3 percent in the second half of 1988 
the economy as measured by the gross national product grew at 
an annual rate of 32 percent in the first six months of the year 
sprinkel said growth could slow to 28 percent in the final six 
months and still be enough to meet the administrations target of 3 
percent growth for all of 1988 when measured from the fourth 
quarter of 1987 
sprinkel said the slower growth should help ease fears that the 
country was about to embark on a renewed inflationary spiral 
triggered by heavy demand bumping up against tight labor markets 
and high factory operating rates 
this slowdown should help lower interest rates sprinkel said 
my own view is that we can expect some relief on interest 
rates in the period ahead he said 
sprinkel said the slowdown has caused the unemployment rate to 
rise slightly in the past two months although it still remained 
near 14year lows in august the jobless rate was 56 percent up 
from 53 percent in june 
sprinkel predicted the downward trend should resume helping to 
push the jobless rate toward 5 percent 
sprinkels comments came in a briefing to reporters on the 
70month expansion since the 198182 recession a recovery which 
sprinkel credited to the progrowth economic policies pursued by 
president reagan 
the present recordbreaking expansion has raised living 
standards reduced poverty reduced inflation and created nearly 18 
million new jobs most of them good jobs at good rates of pay 
sprinkel said

industries inc to embroider the patches that adorn the space suits 
of the astronauts the companys president says

tribute to the seven challenger astronauts as it has for every 
manned mission since apollo 12 the second moon landing

sky on a plume of fire and smoke and streaking through a red 
vlike vector a multirayed sun creeps over the horizon and the 
big dipper hangs in the sky

safe mission and the red vector the symbol of aeronautics the 
traditional strength of the space agency 
the seven stars of the dipper symbolize challenger astronauts 
the patch has five colors but such emblems can have up to 19 
compared with three colors in a typical commercial or military 
design said company president bernhard conrad 
we sometimes spend a dollar and charge a dime but we do it 
for the prestige the satisfaction and the chance to sell to 
collectors he said adding that the emblems represent only a 
small part of its 11 million annual volume

michael dukakis waved a 20 bill in the air wednesday and 
ridiculed george bushs plan for a middleclass tax break as worthy 
of ebenezer scrooge the vice president said his idea would give 
average americans a chance at a little nest egg 
an aggressive dukakis also accused the reagan administration of 
permitting a hall of shame to spring up over the last seven 
years citing dozens and dozens of top administration officials 
who broke the law or violated the public trust he said he would 
crack down on lobbying by officials who leave their government 
posts 
bush tried to turn the tables on his rival criticizing the 
democrats plan to collect billion of dollars in delinquent taxes 
and to offer students guaranteed loans to be repaid through a 
lifetime of payroll deductions 
we do not need to put the irs on your tail for the rest of 
your life he said 
youre going to win by a landslide i know it country 
singer loretta lynn told the vice president as the campaigns bus 
caravan rolled through rural illinois said barbara bush you and 
i and his mother are the only three who think thats true 
most polls make the race a tight one with a little less than 
six weeks remaining to judgment day 
vice presidential candidates dan quayle and lloyd bentsen went 
through their daily campaign paces as they pointed toward next 
weeks nationally televised debate in omaha neb 
dukakis took time out from his attacks on bush to meet privately 
and pose for pictures with soviet foreign minister eduard 
shevardnadze in this country for the united nations general 
assembly meeting the soviet diplomat who met with bush last week 
said he wasnt playing favorites in the presidential camopaign 
its up to the american people to elect a president he said 
through an interpreter 
earlier dukakis stepped up his attack on bushs new plan for 
taxdeferred savings accounts as he campaigned in western 
pennsylvania 
waving a 20 bill to represent the amount the average family 
would save in a year he declared george bush plays santa claus 
to the wealthy and ebenezer scrooge to the rest of us that was a 
reference to bushs call for a cut in the capital gains tax a move 
that dukakis says would give huge benefits to the rich 
bush campaigned the old fashioned way through central illinois 
leading a eightbus caravan through a string of small towns on an 
early autumn day he mixed political offense with defense along his 
150mile route 
he said his proposal for taxdeferred savings account was a move 
designed to give taxpayers a little nest egg under the plan 
low or middleincome americans could invest up to 1000 a year in 
a longterm savings account and defer paying taxes on the interest 
only those earning under 50000 would qualify for the full 
benefit and one bush adviser traveling with the vice president 
said as the plan was unveiled tuesday that the annual savings would 
be under 20 per individual 
the vice president sought to turn the tables with an attack on 
dukakis plan to assure college financing for all under his 
approach the government would give you a loan then take a bit out 
of your paycheck for the next 40 years bush said 
at a later stop as he wended his way north on us highway 51 
he criticized dukakis for wanting to squeeze another 35 billion 
bucks out of the taxpayers pockets he said the irs would have to 
double its work force of 200000 to meet dukakis goal 
an aide to dukakis later said bush was misrepresenting the 
facts the aide leslie dach said dukakis plan to collect unpaid 
taxes would require a growth of 6 percent a year in the number of 
irs agents he said the student loan program would be government 
guaranteed but the money would come from banks not the treasury 
dukakis proposes permitting any student regardless of family 
income to receive a federally guaranteed student loan the money 
would be repaid over a lifetime through payroll deductions he also 
says he wants the government to move aggressively against tax 
cheats before he will listen to any talk of possibly raising taxes 
the subject for dukakis first stop of the day was government 
ethics and he sought to tie bush to the administrations record 
george bush may be satisfied with the revolving door between 
the administration and private lobbying firms where selfservice 
replaces public service and dishonest consultants are ripping off 
the pentagon dukakis said i say we can do better 
he said he would sign an executive order the day he takes office 
barring several hundred high officials from lobbying the government 
after they leave their posts the order would remain in effect for 
the duration of a dukakis administration 
high government office is a public trust not a training camp 
for foreign lobbyists or a vehicle for private gain he said 
dukakis running mate lloyd bentsen visited truman high school in 
independence mo and likened himself to the man who moved into 
the oval office after franklin roosevelts death like harry 
truman im ready he said ready to run and serve with mike 
dukakis 
bentsen left the impression that he doesnt think his 
41yearold rival is up to the presidency 
ill tell you if they were elected id pray for the good 
health of george bush every night the 67yearold texas senator 
said 
quayle campaigned in bentsens home state of texas helping 
raise funds for republican rep beau bolter who is challenging 
bentsens bid for a new senate term he said dukakis has close ties 
to an organization that advocates deep cuts in defense and has as 
supporters the extreme left wing of the democratic party

the education department on wednesday issued a 
report designed to aid governors state legislators and educational 
committees on how best to measure performance of americas public 
schools 
theres not much point in trying to improve schools unless you 
can measure whether the efforts are working chester e finn 
jr assistant secretary of the office of educational research and 
improvement oeri said in a statement 
were long past the days when good intentions and lots of 
activity were acceptable signs of movement now policymakers want 
and the public deserves clear evidence of actual 
accomplishment finn continued 
the 66page report entitled creating responsible and 
responsive accountability systems report of the oeri state 
accountability study group is based on an indepth examination 
of 10 states systems and a survey of 50 states and the district of 
columbia 
the study group composed of 27 members from 10 states and five 
national organizations was convened last year to examine the trend 
in state monitoring of the results of education practices 
the report details review systems in 50 states and the district 
of columbia and is intended to help states produce information that 
is reliable fair and useful for improving schools 
i think states without exception have the constitutional 
responsibility for education finn told a press conference and 
i believe that states have a responsibility that goes with that to 
know how their schools are doing 
they need to know that even if their localities dont want to 
know that he added 
the state has an obligation to see that the public is 
informed the governor is informed the legislature is informed and 
the taxpayer is informed said finn adding that local communities 
should not have the option of concealing such information from the 
public 
i think it is also desirable to have this information 
available on the district level so that the residents of district a 
can see if their kids and their tax dollars are being well 
served finn noted 
in california the report noted that the state education 
department sends a yearly report card to every school complete 
with an acheivement ranking 
in south carolina districts displaying student achievement 
gains may receive monetary awards and bonuses for gains in student 
and teacher attendance failing school districts may be subject to 
withholding of funds or state intervention the report said 
the document also attempted to address educators concerns that 
some evaluation techniques may make unfair comparisons encourage 
over testing or narrow their focus by using only standardized tests 
results 
the reports recommendations include using a variety of 
indicators to measure performance make performance data public 
consider programs rewards and incentives to encourage high 
performance and offer assistance to low performing districts 
before considering state intervention

prime minister mieczyslaw rakowski 
consulted political leaders handed out awards and gave interviews 
wednesday on a busy first full day on the job 
rakowski announced on the evening television news he would meet 
thursday with officials of the governmentsanctioned trade union 
alliance opzz which had demanded the resignation of the previous 
government 
he told a polish television interviewer he would also meet with 
other people but youll learn about that tomorrow 
the activities of rakowski the former party propaganda chief 
dominated the report of the staterun news agency pap and the tv 
news devoted 10 minutes of its halfhour program to him 
parliament on tuesday overwhelmingly approved rakowski 61 a 
hardline opponent of the banned trade union solidarity as 
polands ninth prime minister since world war ii 
the government led by zbigniew messner resigned sept 19 
following fierce criticism of its failure to achieve economic 
reform 
rakowski met with the leaders of the communistallied peasants 
party and the democratic party to start building a new cabinet 
in his acceptance speech to parliament rakowski had asked for 
two weeks to form a government of people with reformist 
attitudes to broaden the base of the communistdominated 
government 
the veteran party journalist received the soviet ambassador 
vladimir brovikov and departing italian ambassador paolo galli pap 
said 
rakowski also presented awards for achievements in the housing 
industry saying his governments success would depend on whether 
it could improve the housing situation pap said 
poles can wait up to 30 years to obtain an apartment and the 
housing shortage is a major source of public discontent 
as prime minister rakowski faces tremendous economic 
challenges authorities concede that confidence in the government 
has eroded significantly due to the failure of the economic reform 
to produce results 
inflation is running at 60 percent annually consumer goods are 
in short supply and workers are restless after staging two waves of 
punishing strikes in the worst labor strife in seven years 
the turmoil ended sept 3 when the authorities promised 
solidarity leader lech walesa that talks would be held to consider 
the unions future 
solidarity which was the soviet blocs only recognized 
independent trade movement was suppressed when poland declared 
martial law in 1981 and banned the following year

a girl with aids should be separated from 
classmates but a judge went too far in ordering that she sit in a 
glass booth an attorney for the 7yearold told a federal appeals 
panel wednesday 
eliana martinez could sit out of reach from classmates at a 
kidneyshaped table said steve hanlon the lawyer hired by the 
girls adoptive mother rosa martinez he said such a plan would 
fulfill guidelines issued by the federal centers for disease 
control 
ms martines contends it would be detrimental to her daughters 
development to sit in a glass cage but the 11th us court of 
appeals judges expressed concerns at the hearing about whether the 
alternative was to expose the other children in the special 
education classroom to the incurable disease 
the threejudge panel gave no indication when it would rule 
its a tough tough case tom gonzalez an attorney for the 
hillsborough county school board said he said no case had 
previously arisen in us courts of a retarded incontinent child 
with aids 
the cdc has concluded children exposed to aids do not generally 
pose a risk to their classmates but some unconvinced parents are 
still raising objections 
in south roxana ill school officials are bracing for protests 
thursday as 8yearold jason robertson entrs second grade jasons 
family left the st louis suburb of granite city last month saying 
theyd been harassed for their efforts to enroll him in regular 
classes there 
in august a federal judge in tampa ruled eliana could go to 
school but she had to stay inside a glass or plexiglas enclosure 
until she was toilet trained and stopped sucking her fingers 
the school board wanted the child to be taught at home but 
agreed to the partition and built it 
we believe great harm would occur to that child if she went 
into that enclosure hanlon told the appellate panel 
citing medical testimony from the trial he said the risk of 
transmitting the fatal disease to other children was a remote 
theoretical potential that testimony referred to exposure to the 
aids virus through tears saliva and urine 
appeals judge robert s vance noted that the trial judges order 
mentioned that eliana had a condition of mouth sores and cracked 
lips called oral thrush but didnt say what risk it poses 
i see a significant risk which i cant erase from my mind 
said vance he said handicapped children are known to bite each 
other which he said could spread aids if the infected child had a 
trace of blood in the mouth 
to put a child in such a situation may be sentencing those 
children to death that evidence a judge is not going to treat 
lightly he said 
hanlon said elianas doctors found no evidence of blood in the 
mouth but if bleeding developed eliana would be held out of class 
doctors believe eliana was infected by blood transfusions 
following her premature birth in puerto rico mrs martinez a 
licensed practical nurse adopted her as an infant after hearing a 
radio appeal for a homeless child 
mrs martinez attended the hearing and afterward was joined by 
eliana on the courthouse steps 
eliana will not go into that glass enclosure mrs martinez 
said she would not be happy there shes not going thats it i 
want her in a regular classroom with trainable mentally 
handicapped children just like her i think the school board has 
stalled enough

precisely the same place it was before sundays debate a 
statistical dead heat with 50 percent for george bush and 46 
percent for michael dukakis 
the national abc news survey conducted monday and tuesday among 
674 likely voters mirrored the 5046 result of an abc poll 
conducted last week the new poll had a margin of error of plus or 
minus 5 points 
an overnight poll by abc immediately after the debate found 
respondents divided on who won and none of four such polls 
measured any significant movement in support as a result of the 
event an abc poll done monday found increasing numbers calling the 
debate a tie 
abc said its polls have found the race basically a tie since 
the republican national convention last month when bush made up a 
lead dukakis had taken from the democratic convention in july

a us mediator said south africa 
angola and cuba extended on wednesday talks on ending angolas 
civil war officials said a timetable for withdrawal of 50000 
cuban troops remained a key issue 
the talks which were to end wednesday will continue and us 
mediators are confident that the remaining questions will be 
approached in a positive spirit which will result in a final 
accord us envoy chester crocker said 
crocker assistant us secretary of state for african affairs 
said in a statement the parties involved in the brazzaville 
talks continue to show a constructive attitude at the negotiating 
table 
he met separately with the south african and angolancuban 
delegations 
president mobutu seso seko of zaire meanwhile sought to arrange 
an african summit to negotiate an end to the 13yearold conflict 
said government sources in kinshasa zaires capital the sources 
spoke on condition of anonymity 
speaking on the third day of usmediated peace talks between 
south africa and an angolancuban delegation south africas chief 
negotiator neil van heerden said it is still difficult to say 
whether there will be an accord signed in brazzaville 
van heerden directorgeneral of foreign affairs department 
told reporters there is still a gulf between us and the 
angolans 
cuban spokesman alcibiades hidalgo said cuban forces could 
only leave after fulfilling all its obligations 
hidalgo added if south african continues to link the 
withdrawal of cuban troops to independence for namibia and 
requires their pullout within 12 months this could constitute an 
obstacle to the conclusion of an accord 
south africa has withdrawn its forces from angola and insists 
that angola send home an estimated 50000 cuban troops angola 
initially said it would need four years for the cuban withdrawal 
while south africa said the troops should be out in one year the 
brazzaville talks were aimed at reaching a compromise 
van heerden said south africa recognized it was difficult to 
demand the immediate withdrawal of 50000 cubans particularly 
because of angolas internal security problems the marxist 
government there has been battling the rebel national union for the 
total independence of angola which has been supported by south 
africa the united states and other countries 
african diplomats have said they hope the brazzaville talks will 
lead to a formal agreement signed at the united nations 
the latest round of talks began monday the main issue has been 
the length of time cuban troops will remain in angola once south 
africa begins its implementation of a un independence plan for 
southwest africa also known as namibia 
south africa regards the cuban presence in angola as a threat to 
southwest africa angolas southern neighbor as well as a menace 
to its own security

television cant make you feel the 
ground shake when the space shuttle starts flying and cant make 
you feel the awe as this 16storytall structure rises from the 
ground but youll see it better and longer than the people who are 
on the spot 
if the weather is clear a person in launch control can see the 
shuttle clear the tower and do its majestic 120degree turn and 
follow it until it becomes a pinpoint of light 4 minutes later 
but air force cameras at a nearby base stay with the shuttle far 
longer the home viewer clearly can see the ships spent solid fuel 
booster rockets fall into the atlantic ocean 150 miles downrange 
two minutes into the flight 
the challenger explosion 2 years ago came 73 seconds after 
liftoff when the ship was only 89 miles away from its launchpad

three children and two teenagers huddled 
together in one room died in a blaze wednesday as firefighters cut 
through iron burglar bars to reach them 
another child was in critical condition with burns officials 
said 
at this time the cause is still under investigation said 
dallas fire department investigator raymond lee 
lee said a gasoline can was found in the house all we know at 
this point is that it was bought to mow the yard he said but 
didnt know if it had any gas in it 
beverly handy of the dallas county medical examiners office 
identified the victims as jasmine jordan 1 ericka jordan 9 
jamal jordan 6 bernard jordan 16 and demetra jordan 18 
the causes of the deaths had not been determined handy said 
ketrick jordan 10 was in critical condition with burns over 
about half of his body said parkland memorial hospital spokesman 
tom geddie a blood drive had been started for him at the hospital 
officials said 
officials said the children lived with their grandmother 
52yearold molly jordan who was at work when the fire began 
called to the scene by fire officials she later was hospitalized 
for shock 
the children were found gathered in one bedroom suggesting they 
were aware of the fire officials said fire officials found the 
oldest boy bernard huddled over two of the younger children 
apparently trying to protect them on the floor between two twin 
beds 
just guessing id say it took at least five minutes longer 
getting in because of the bars said investigator doug preston 
it could have been longer a few minutes can be the difference 
between life and death 
the fire department received the call at 409 am and arrived 
with two vehicles including a barcutting saw at 412 am 
preston said 
fire investigator don howard said firefighters also were 
hampered by a love seat pushed against the house door 
it was not the first time burglar bars have slowed fire rescue 
or escape efforts in the city 
shortly after four women and three children died in january 1986 
in a house protected by barred windows and doors the dallas city 
council changed the building code requiring the bars be able to 
open on hinges from the inside 
the law wasnt retroactive in august 1987 two separate fires 
in which bars were on the windows claimed the lives of three people 
the newer dallas code requires that the bars be able to open 
from the inside preston said these were the older ones they 
cant be pulled off theyre usually bolted through the walls

democrat michael dukakis pledging to 
shut a revolving door between government jobs and private lobbying 
derided george bush on wednesday for an administration he said was 
a wheel of fortune for future foreign agents 
maintaining an aggressive assault on his republican rival 
dukakis also ridiculed bushs new taxdeferred savings plan waving 
a 20 bill to represent the amount an average family would save in 
a year he declared george bush plays santa claus to the wealthy 
and ebenezer scrooge to the rest of us 
before a large crowd that filled a street at the center of 
greensburg in western pennsylvania the democratic presidential 
nominee sought to link the vice president with allegations of 
ethical violations and illegality by former offiials of the reagan 
administration and with the lobbying for foreign governments of 
bushs own associates 
george bush may be satisfied with this administrations hall 
of shame dozens and dozens of top administration officials who 
broke the law or violated the public trust dukakis said 
he may be satisfied with letting japan make the cars while his 
former colleagues make the license plates i say america can do 
better than that 
later the massachusetts governor met for an hour in new york 
with soviet foreign minister eduard shevardnadze in a session 
dukakis said was just a chance to get acquainted 
bush met last week with shevardnadze who told reporters the 
vice president had been involved in past highlevel ussoviet 
meetings 
dukakis said afterward i made clear to the foreign minister 
that i was not here to negotiate or discuss specific proposals we 
have one president and i support president reagans effort to move 
forward on these issues right up to the end of his term of office 
but dukakis also said he brought up the plight of soviet jews 
and the pace of the soviet withdrawal from afghanistan 
shevardnadze asked which of the two candidates he preferred 
said diplomatically ill tell you after the election 
dukakis was meeting later with west german leader hans dietrich 
genscher and planned a thursday morning meeting with french leader 
francois mitterand 
in pennsylvania dukakis pledged to sign the day i take 
office an executive order toughening restrictions on lobbying by 
former administration officials an accompanying statement said he 
would issue a second order curbing government contacts with former 
members of congress for some period of time 
in a dukakis administration were not going to turn the white 
house into a wheel of fortune for future foreign agents dukakis 
said in a dukakis white house the staff is going to pledge 
allegiance to only one flag and thats old glory 
bush said last spring that he was tired of being embarrassed 
by ethical lapses in government and said he would establish a new 
ethics panel in the white house if elected to try and avoid the 
excesses of the past 
he did not go into detail 
dukakis in renewing his assault on the administrations ethical 
record cited the lobbying work of a firm whose members include 
bush campaign manager lee atwater and other campaign advisers 
george bush may be satisfied that some of his top campaign 
aides were hired guns for a bahamian government whose leaders are 
under investigation for drug activity i say america can do better 
than that he said 
dukakis aides outlined an integrity in government initiative 
that dukakis said he would sign as president it said top officials 
of a dukakis white house would be barred from any lobbying efforts 
for the duration of the dukakis administration regardless of when 
they left their government jobs 
aides said that would extend current ethics act prohibitions on 
lobbying which range from one to three years after leaving office 
depending on the type of lobbying activity they said it would also 
extend the prohibition on lobbying by former white house officials 
to include lobbying of any executive branch agency 
a description prepared by the campaign said it would eliminate 
regulations of the reagan administration which divided the 
executive office of the president into nine components a move that 
allowed former offiials of one component to immediately lobby 
officials in another component after leaving government the 
statement called this arrangement an artificial division and 
the deaver loophole a reference to convicted former reagan 
aide michael deaver 
as a result of this loophole michael deaver could only be 
charged with perjury the statement said 
dukakis aides handed out printed sheets listing 64 former 
administration officials that it said were convicted forced to 
resign or misused their office for personal gain the list 
however included some people who were later cleared and some such 
as james watt who resigned after getting into political hot water 
he was not accused of ethics violations

a jury deliberating the weapons charges case 
against syndicated columnist carl t rowan recessed for the night 
wednesday after discussing the matter for three hours without 
reaching a verdict 
district of columbia superior court judge arthur l burnett sr 
sent the jury home at 6 pm and ordered the 12member panel to 
avoid reading about or listening to broadcast accounts of the trial 
rowan an outspoken opponent of handgun use and possession has 
been charged with using an unregistered pistol and ammunition to 
shoot a youth who took an unauthorized dip in his pool 
if convicted of both misdemeanor offenses the 63yearold 
columnist could face up to two years in prison and a 2000 fine 
they came in here to prosecute a celebrity rowans 
attorney raoul carroll said at the close of a twoday trial in 
dc superior court they arent interested in the truth 
carroll also argued that rowans son carl jr had repeatedly 
been told by police officials that he did not have to register the 
weapon his father later used to wound the teenage intruder 
he was depending upon the competence and intelligence of those 
people that the district of columbia put there to advise citizens 
on gun registration carroll argued he was entirely at the 
mercy of the district of columbia 
the case centered on whether rowan and his son were misled by 
city police officials about the districts strict handgun 
registration policy and the prosecutions contention that rowan sr 
was not authorized to handle the weapon 
the handgun ordinance prohibits any person except security 
officers from registering weapons although exemptions commonly are 
made for law enforcement officers 
rowans son was an fbi agent when he tried to register the 
weapon inspector james r lee head of the citys gun control 
unit testified that rowan jr was not authorized to transfer the 
weapon to anyone 
rowan testified that he was given the 22caliber pistol by his 
son in 1982 after receiving several death threats from persons 
purporting to be members of the ku klux klan 
the columnist testified that he shot benjamin smith 18 of 
suburban chevy chase md in the early hours of june 14 because he 
thought smith was trying to break into his home 
thomas c collier the citys attorney argued in closing that 
the case before the jury was vry simple 
we are here simply because the handgun is not registered 
collier said the death threats the shooting and the issue of 
trespassing have nothing to do with this case 
police officers who investigated the shooting testified that a 
door at the rear of rowans home showed signs that someone had 
tried to break in one officer also testified that the police 
investigation revealed smith had been shot at close range just 
outside rowans home

accused regional and international quarters of involvement in 
this dirty plot

a soldier in separate incidents soldiers killed two rebels

surveillance he said the military was collecting evidence before 
we take up action 
the business executives and politicians were providing

characterizes the government today

israeli troops wednesday 
barred supporters of americanborn legislator meir kahane from 
holding his antiarab partys election convention in the west bank 
in jerusalem police banned israeli extremists from touring the 
temple mount a sacred site claimed by moslems and jews 
israeli soldiers shot and wounded nine arabs in the occupied 
west bank and gaza strip including a 10yearold boy shot in the 
head while playing on the roof of his house in the city of nablus 
hospital officials said speaking anonymously 
the army confirmed three wounded 
kahane whose kach party has called for expulsion of all arabs 
from israel and the occupied territories scheduled his convention 
for the arab city of hebron despite an army order banning the 
meeting 
i want the arabs to realize that in four years when i am 
prime minister it will be a jewish city not an arab city 
kahane said before departing jerusalem 
he led two buses and a dozen cars and vans on a threehour 
odyssey seeking a back road to hebron at times the caravan 
appeared lost and kahane at one point asked an arab villager for 
directions 
the caravan stoned by arabs in several villages was finally 
stopped by an army patrol seven miles south of jerusalem 
the rightwing likud bloc also mounted a west bank tour 
wednesday taking about 4000 israelis to visit jewish settlements 
near nablus 30 miles north of jerusalem 
benny begin son of former prime minister menachem begin and a 
candidate for parliament in the nov 1 elections told the crowd 
likud would never trade the west bank in a peace agreement 
during the tour one israeli passenger was hit in the head by a 
rock and taken to a hospital the army said israeli radio 
identified her as shoshana greidi 73 
in east jerusalem arab youths rioted for second day in the 
jabal mukaber neighborhood to protest the death of a 19yearold 
palestinian hit in the mouth with a tear gas canister monday 
police and israel radio said police fired tear gas to disperse the 
crowd 
earlier wednesday in jerusalem officers turned back about 30 
members of the temple mount faithful a group which demands jewish 
control over the area known in arabic as haram elsharif or noble 
enclosure 
the raised platform is sacred to jews as the site of the holy 
temple destroyed by the romans in ad 70 and to moslems as the 
place where the prophet mohammed ascended to heaven in the 7th 
century 
the mount dominated by the golden dome of the rock and al aqsa 
mosques is under moslem administration 
a visit by the group last year prompted violent protests by 
hundreds of palestinians and police feared moslem protests would 
be more severe this year 
gershon solomon head of the group called the ban painful 
humiliating and antijewish 
also wednesday the office of defense minister yitzhak rabin 
retracted a hardline comment issued a day earlier 
rabin said tuesday the army was intentionally trying to wound 
palestinian protesters with newly introduced plastic bullets our 
aim is to cause more casualties he said 
but his spokesman eitan haber said rabin meant to stress that 
plastic bullets were being used to avoid lethal injuries caused by 
lead bullets 
in washington the state department said it was disturbed by 
israels use of plastic bullets 
we can see no justification for a policy admittedly designed 
to cause an increase in casualties spokeswoman phyllis oakley 
said 
since the uprising began dec 8 278 palestinians have been 
killed six israelis also have died

george bush toured the small towns of 
central illinois in a bus caravan wednesday painting democratic 
opponent michael dukakis as an inexperienced liberal governor 
bent on beefing up the police powers of the internal revenue 
service 
stressing policy differences with dukakis and suggesting more 
than once that the massachusetts governor would make it easier for 
the irs to go after ordinary citizens bush declared i am with 
the american people 
bushs eightbus caravan complete with an entourage of country 
music entertainers wended its way north on us highway 51 
passing farm after farm and stopping at towns like el paso 
population 2700 and minonk population 2250 
bushs trip was intended to galvanize republicans and lure away 
democrats in central illinois to offset the traditionally large 
democratic vote in chicago and cook county 
he wants to squeeze another 35 billion bucks out of the 
taxpayers pocket bush said claiming the irs would have to 
double its workforce to 200000 people under dukakis in order to 
carry out his proposal to collect billions of dollars in delinquent 
and evaded taxes 
i have confidence in the honesty of the american people 
bush said i am not for a program that is going to increase irs 
seizures and give the irs more power 
bush rode in the first bus accompanied by his wife barbara 
and country music singers loretta lynn crystal gayle and peggy sue 
wright who warmed up the crowds with favorites such as coal 
miners daughter and praise the lord i saw the light 
 
 
bush told voters he has come under attack for criticizing 
dukakis veto of a bill that would have required public school 
teachers to lead students in reciting the pledge of allegiance 
dukakis acted after an advisory opinion from the state supreme 
court said the bill was unconstitutional 
the liberals hate it bush said referring to his criticism 
they cant stand it but i am right and i am with the american 
people on this and on voluntary prayer in school and a whole bunch 
of things i consider fundamental values 
he stressed that he supports the death penalty and dukakis 
opposes it 
bush said the united states was able to sign a nucleararms 
treaty with the soviet union last december because we 
strengthened america and knew how to negotiate with the soviets 
and i dont think this is any time to turn to an inexperienced 
liberal governor of massachusetts to handle the national security 
matters of the united states of america bush said 
after six stops and six speeches bush was having some trouble 
getting his message out he told a small audience at a del monte 
corn packing plant that the reagan administration had achieved 
success in dealing with the soviets because strength through 
peace works and wed better never forget that 
with 25 electoral votes illinois is one of the big prizes in 
the presidential race and bush has made five visits here since 
midsummer seeking an edge in a neckandneck contest 
illinois is vital to the election bush said at a illinois 
state university rally in normal at the start of the day and 
before nov 8 im going to be back again and again because the 
land of lincoln is going to be absolutely critical in choosing the 
next president 
at the rally with students bush attacked dukakis collegeloan 
proposal under which funds borrowed for school would be repaid 
over a long period by deductions from paychecks 
we do not need to put the irs on your tail for the rest of 
your life as the reward for a college education bush said 
putting in a pitch for his own plan for a college savings bond 
under which interest would accumulate tax free 
the dukakis campaign said bush misstated the programs it said 
bush claimed the student loans were government loans rather than 
bank loans and it said dukakis irs program only calls for a 6 
percent annual growth rate in the number of irs personnel 
before farm audiences bush pledged to expand agricultural 
markets resist protectionism and never impose a grain embargo as 
president carter did 
other communities on bushs sevenstop tour were wenona 
mendota and west brooklyn which with a population of 200 was the 
smallest town on the trip

president reagan on tuesday signed an 88 
billion military construction spending bill but gave agreed only 
partially to a requirement that the administration notify 
congressional committees in advance of some military exercises 
the legislation requires 30 days notice from the secretary of 
defense to specified committees of the plans and scope for any 
proposed military exercise involving us personnel if construction 
costs are expected to exceed 100000

understanding that this section encompasses only exercises where 
providing 30 days advance notice is feasible and consistent with 
my constitutional authority and duty to protect the national 
security 
the compromise measure adds to the current fiscal year 
construction budget of 83 billion but falls short of the 97 
billion sought by reagan 
the measure includes 65 million for the final stage of 
construction of a national test facility in colorado for reagans 
strategic defense initiative also known as star wars the 100 
million project will be used to test sdi components 
reagan had also sought 31 million for construction of a 
railroadbased version of the mx nucleartipped missile but 
congress appropriated no funds for the purpose leaving the 
decision on the future of the railbased mx weapon up to the next 
administration 
the measure provides 173 million to the navy to build new bases 
around the nations coasts and 50 million to build a closed 
incinerator at tooele army depot in utah to destroy obsolete and 
aging chemical weapons the army is continuing work on new chemical 
weapons although the president has called for an international 
conference to outlaw their use 
the measure was the sixth bill the president has signed out of 
the 11 appropraitions measures that congress considers each year

the united states and spain on wednesday 
concluded an agreement for eight more years of american military 
use of spanish bases 
the deal was sealed at a meeting between secretary of state 
george p shultz and spanish foreign minister francisco 
fernandezordonez 
for the first time state department spokesman charles e redman 
said no us economic or military aid will be provided for use of 
the bases 
redman said the agreement underscored that a us military 
presence in spain served the common interest of the two 
countries 
he also said the two sides were able to resolve a nuclear 
question that had become entwined in the negotiations 
spanish prime minister felipe gonzales initially had vowed to 
keep spanish territory and naval ports free of us nuclear 
weapons worldwide us policy meanwhile is to neither confirm 
nor deny the presence of such weapons on american warships or 
fighter planes 
redman said the us policy would be upheld presumably this 
means spainish authorities will not put such questions to american 
commanders 
earlier in the year the united states agreed to remove 72 us 
f16 jets from torrejon a base outside madrid the warplanes were 
shifted to italy 
this apparently satisfied gonzales initial demand for a sharp 
reduction in the us military presence in spain 
redman said us and spanish negotiators had worked hard to 
resolve all the details of the agreement were happy on both 
sides with the outcome he said 
shultz also met with polish foreign minister tadeusz olechowski 
on recent developments in the east european country a veteran 
politician and foe of the outlawed trade union solidarity 
miecyslaw rakowski was chosen prime minister on monday by the 
communist party central committee in warsaw 
redman said deputy secretary of state john c whitehead would 
visit poland oct 12 as part of a growing dialogue with polish 
authorities we are very interested in these developments 
redman said 
the us official said poland also was very interested in 
continuing to pursue the dialogue with washington

congress sent a 108 billion transportation 
spending bill for 1989 to the white house on wednesday several 
days after lawmakers made it vetoproof by removing language 
airline labor unions had championed 
the house gave final congressional approval to the measure on a 
voice vote shortly after the senate signed off on the bill with a 
voice vote of its own the house had given initial approval to the 
measure tuesday on a 39213 vote but had to consider it again 
after the senate made lastminute technical amendments 
reagan was expected to sign the legislation by saturday the 
start of the 1989 federal fiscal year it is the eighth 
appropriations bill the president has received as lawmakers rush to 
send reagan all 13 spending measures before the new year begins 
last thursday housesenate negotiators sliced laborsought 
language out of the bill that reagan had said would cause him to 
veto the entire measure 
that provision included in the house version of the bill 
approved earlier this year would have required airlines to pay 
benefits to employees whose jobs are lost or whose incomes are 
diminished due to mergers 
besides providing 108 billion in new spending for fiscal 1989 
the appropriations bill would allow the government to spend another 
147 billion on transportation programs money that would come 
from various federal taxes on fuel and air travel 
the bill would funnel 32 billion to mass transit 122 
billion to highway programs 63 billion to aviation and 28 
billion to the coast guard among other things it provides 584 
million in grants for amtrak the national passenger railroad 
the legislation not only would spend 26 billion more on 
transportation than reagan proposed in the budget he gave congress 
in february but also rearranges the priorities he sought 
in a battle that reagan has waged with congressional democrats 
since the early 1980s the president preferred dramatically less 
spending for mass transit slightly less for highways slightly 
more for aviation and no money at all for amtrak 
despite those differences the provision that most piqued the 
president was the one protecting airline workers supporters argued 
that in an era of frequent mergers workers jobs must be 
protected the administration considered it an intrusion into the 
workings of the free market 
the legislation contains sections that would block the 
construction of a shopping mall in manassas va near the site of 
two important civil war battles and prohibit the government from 
withholding federal highway aid for states whose drivers disobey 
the 55 mph speed limit legislation passed last year allowing 
states to increase their speed limits to 65 mph dropped such 
sanctions for those states 
the measure would also allow logan international airport in 
boston temporarily to continue new higher landing fees for small 
airplanes to encourage them to use other airfields 
the bill would allow logan to continue receiving federal aid 
until the federal department of transportation completes an 
investigation of the controversial program if the agency 
determines that the logan plan is illegal government assistance to 
the airport would be halted

republican vice presidential nominee dan 
quayle continuing the gop strategy of painting democrat michael 
dukakis as too liberal for american voters said wednesday that 
dukakis had close ties to a group that advocates deep cuts in 
defense 
quayle said that the group jobs with peace campaign has 
an extreme liberal agenda the main feature being a radical cut 
in the us defense budget 
on tuesday quayle called on dukakis to resign his membership in 
the american civil liberties union another group the republicans 
have attacked in saying dukakis is out of touch with mainstream 
views 
quayles latest salvo came at a fundraising rally for rep beau 
boulter who is trying to capture the senate seat of sen lloyd 
bentsen the democratic vice presidential nominee 
under texas law bentsen is allowed to undertake both his senate 
reelection bid and the vice presidential race boulter is trailing 
badly in the senate race 
quayle has barely mentioned bentsen in his campaign swing 
through texas but he told boulter we want you to be in the 
united states senate this year 
gop strategists say they want quayle to concentrate his 
firepower on dukakis not on the no 2 man on the ticket 
quayle said that dukakis was on the advisory board of the 
bostonbased group which in a 1987 fundraising mailing said it 
intended to make the federal budget a local issue by showing the 
tradeoff between military and domestic spending and supported a 
25 percent cut in defense spending 
the list of advisers to the organization reads like a roster 
of the extreme left wing of the democratic party and includes 
jesse jackson george mcgovern rep ron dellums of california and 
sen john kerry of massachusetts quayle said 
among the groups goals quayle said was to cancel the mx 
midgetman and star wars weapons systems the stealth bomber and to 
cut the m1 tank the very one mr dukakis was riding in by 50 
percent the republicans have been making much of dukakis ride 
several weeks ago in the tank at a general dynamics plant in 
detroit 
quayle said dukakis had been more than an adviser to the 
group testifying at a 1983 mock hearing launching jobs with 
peace week and praising the groups aims 
yet now in the midst of an election the man from 
massachusetts is riding in tanks claiming to support weapons hes 
previously opposed and generally trying to hide his past 
antidefense positions he said 
michael brown program director for the bostonbased group said 
that dukakis is indeed on the advisory board other members include 
dellums kerry and rep pat schroeder dcolo he said 
the groups purpose is basically to point out that there has 
been a huge increase in military spending brown said we 
do see big tradeoffs 
quayle headed to dallas for a fundraiser and rally before 
returning to washington where he will prepare for his debate next 
wednesday with bentsen 
earlier wednesday the indiana senator had an upbeat message 
when he addressed young people at an el paso job corps center that 
is rated as the nations highest in terms of placing youngsters in 
jobs advanced training and the military 
he told the mostly hispanic audience the greatest 
opportunities in life are still ahead of you 
we are confident in your future he said we are confident 
that you will be confident

a blaze dubbed the texas fire erupted at 1030 am at the mouth 
of duncan canyon 50 miles east of los angeles and the wind also 
fanned to life the embers of a controlled burn near glen helen that 
was squelched on tuesday authorities said

lord melody an outstanding 
pioneer of calypso music and a former composer and arranger for 
singer harry belafonte has died at the age of 63 
lord melody born fitzroy alexander died monday evening in the 
port of spain general hospital after a yearlong battle with cancer 
a city mortuary official said 
the official who spoke on condition that he not be identified 
said funeral arrangements were incomplete he said authorities were 
awaiting the arrival of three children who live in the united 
states he had no other information on survivors 
melody was one of the greatest and earliest professional 
exponents of calypso the lilting syncopated musical style 
indigenous to trinidad 
he first appeared on a calypso stage 42 years ago said local 
impressario holy betaudier 
melody often used his songs to make social commentaries and was 
known for his spicy ballads during the 1960s and 1970s he 
composed and arranged music for belafonte 
out of that relationship came dozens of hits which helped spread 
a mode of expression and type of music that had its origins in the 
caribbean slavery experience 
his greatest attribute was his humor said calypso judge tony 
mitchell 
i knew him for more than 30 years and i think that he was one 
of the greatest composers of calypso music his range of calypsos 
is testimony to his artistry mitchell said 
lord melodys humor was perhaps most trenchant and cutting 
against his own supposed ugliness in the 1950s he was known 
affectionately as the boo boo man

the senate approved legislation wednesday that 
would empower the government to provide 13 billion worth of 
emergency food and housing health care education and other help 
to the nations homeless people over the next two years 
the house passed a similar measure last month negotiators from 
the two chambers will have to compose a compromise bill that would 
have to be approved by both chambers before it is sent to the white 
house for president reagans signature 
the legislation known as the mckinney bill was approved by a 
voice vote it would extend for two years a law that otherwise 
would expire with the end of the 1988 federal fiscal year this 
friday 
the bill would allow the government to provide money to states 
municipalities and private agencies for rental assistance health 
care mental health services alcohol and drug abuse programs 
education and job training projects 
funds would be available for the purchase and rehabilitation of 
group homes in addition unused space at veterans administration 
hospitals would be set aside for the treatment of homeless veterans 
the actual money for the programs would have to be provided in 
separate appropriations bills 
advocates for the countrys homeless population estimated at 
between 250000 and 3 million people have been angry because so 
far the government has not fully financed the legislation in the 
first two years of the law the government has provided only 700 
million out of a possible 11 billion 
the measure is named after the late rep stewart b mckinney 
rconn one of the original sponsors of the bill mckinney died 
may 7 1987 less than three months after the legislation became

chinese foreign minister qian qichen will 
visit the soviet union at the end of this year in the first such 
working visit since the moscowbeijing split of the 1960s soviet 
and chinese officials said wednesday 
the trip points to a major warming of chinesesoviet relations 
and is expected to lead eventually to a sovietchinese summit 
a later return visit by soviet foreign minister eduard a 
shevardnadze to china also was planned but no time was announced 
qian met shevardnadze at the chinese mission on wednesday for a 
discussion of qians visit cambodia and other issues 
soviet foreign ministry spokesman gennady gerasimov later told 
reporters the two talked a lot about cambodia and called the 
talks constructive he said sovietchinese discussions on 
cambodia would continue on the level of experts and deputy foreign 
ministers 
they shevardnadze and qian agreed that actually it must be 
decided by the cambodians but other countries may help he added 
in the past the soviet union has stayed out of the negotiating 
picture and insisted that china and others discuss the matter with 
vietnam 
gerasimov said qian would also meet soviet leader mikhail s 
gorbachev in moscow and added that moscow hopes the ministerial 
visit will lead to a summit between gorbachev and chinese leaders 
the two communist powers once close friends split in the 1960s 
over ideology leadership of the international communist movement 
and other issues 
shevardnadze mentioned that almost everybody in the general 
assembly believes the overall world situation has improved with the 
improvement in sovietamerican relations gerasimov said and 
maybe now it is time to improve sovietchinese relations 
both agreed the state of chinesesoviet relations also has a 
very major influence on the state of the world at large 
chinese premier li peng indicated earlier this month that china 
plans eventually to attend a summit he said all that was needed 
was for lower level talks to reach further agreement on cambodia 
and then a summit could be put on the agenda 
china and the soviet union agreed in october 1985 to an exchange 
of visits of foreign ministers but set no date the plan stalled 
over chinas insistence that the soviets withdraw from afghanistan 
reduce soviet troop strength in mongolia on the border with china 
and persuade the sovietbacked vietnamese government to pull its 
estimated 140000 troops from cambodia 
two of these issues are in the process of being resolved the 
soviets are withdrawing from afghanistan and vietnam has vowed to 
withdraw its forces from cambodia by 1990 both vietnam and 
cambodia are communist states 
chinese and soviet vice foreign ministers have exchanged visits 
repeatedly in the last few years for talks on chinesesoviet border 
issues qian went to moscow several times in that capacity he 
became foreign minister in april 
the forthcoming visit of the 60yearold qian a russian speaker 
who has been posted in moscow marks such visit in at least 20 
years 
former chinese foreign minister huang hua went to moscow in 1982 
to attend the funeral of soviet leader leonid brezhnev but it was 
not a working visit 
the last soviet foreign minister to visit china was andrei 
gromyko now soviet president who went there in 1959 in that 
year thensoviet leader nikita khruschev came to the united 
nations and denounced china 
in an address before the general assembly wednesday qian asked 
for an international peacekeeping force and committee to monitor an 
eventual vietnamese troop withdrawal from cambodia and to supervise 
free elections 
he complained that vietnam is delaying its troop withdrawal and 
asked the assembly to adopt still another resolution its 10th 
demanding an early pullout 
qian emphasized that after a cambodian solution is reached 
china is ready to join other nations in providing international 
guarantees for an independent neutral and nonaligned cambodia 
the vietnamese invaded cambodia in late 1978 and soon replaced 
the prochinese communist regime with a prohanoi promoscow 
government during the 197579 rule by the khmer rouge it is 
estimated that about 2 million of cambodias 8 million people died 
from executions famine and civil unrest

the trail of tears wagon train left the 
hermitage of andrew jackson without a symbolic reconciliation 
between indians and the president who helped send them on a 
1000mile forced march 150 years ago 
andy jacksons done it to us again said wagon train member 
paul quick who is part chickasaw and part blackfoot after the 
wagoneers crossed wires with the ladies hermitage association 
which maintains the historic mansion 
the caravan of 11 wagons is recreating the forced march in which 
4000 indians died on the way to oklahoma 
jackson is associated with the march because he signed the 
indian removal act but martin van buren was president when the 
removal began in 1838 said fred rolater a history professor at 
middle tennessee state university 
jackson is not the person who supervised the removal of the 
indians but he had worked hard for it during his career rolater 
said 
when he became president he was determined to carry it out 
but i dont think anyone would say that he wanted the tragedy that 
occurred he wanted it to be done fairly 
when the party arrived at the hermitage on tuesday afternoon 
they were told they could stay but that the gates would be locked 
at 5 pm and no afterhours visitors would be allowed 
the decision scuttled a plan to entertain visitors tuesday night 
with stories and traditional indian dances 
the group agreed to stay in another hermitageowned field away 
from the front gate but quick said he has asked for a meeting with 
gov ned mcwherter to discuss state cooperation with the project 
fletch coke regent of the ladies hermitage association said 
the problem was with miscommunication over the details of the visit 
we tried to make them welcome for this historic event she 
said wednesday they brought much more than just three wagons 
there were campers and horse trailers 
luvenia butler executive director of the tennessee indian 
commission said she worked with the hermitage to find a suitable 
campsite 
the hermitage people were so nice they found another nice 
meadow and we relocated them there it worked out fine a man from 
nashville donated food to them she said 
quick said the party has endured rigorous conditions since 
leaving red clay historical state park sept 17 the journey is 
scheduled to end in tahlequah okla in early december 
weve slept in chicken yards and on mountain tops tennessees 
been a hard time quick said the people have been nice but 
the setups have been bad 
the wagon train was to stay at a horse riding club wednesday 
night the robertson county fairgrounds on thursday night and a 
campground on friday

harrahs sports book said wednesday it is 
refunding outstanding bets on the olympic 100meter race in which 
ben johnson was disqualified for steroid use but other nevada 
books honored similar wagers 
the canadian top finisher was stripped of his gold medal which 
was given to carl lewis of the united states who finished second 
it didnt seem fair to pay with johnson as the winner because 
he cheated said joe bachman manager of harrahs reno sports 
book but carl lewis didnt win the race either if ben johnson 
wasnt in the race whos to say what would have happened 
mike rumbolz chairman of nevadas gaming control board which 
enforces betting laws said it is up to each sports book whether to 
pay off on disqualified winners 
several nevada bookmakers said the olympic results should be 
treated like a horse race in which bettors are paid off for winners 
later disqualified 
in horse racing when a race is run and the results are 
declared official at the finish line thats that bettors are paid 
off no matter what happens later said scott hall assistant 
manager of the reno turf club 
the turf club did not put out a line on the olympic matchup the 
hilton and the aladdin hotelcasinos and little caesars sports 
books in las vegas joined harrahs in taking bets on the friday 
race and all three paid off on johnson as did books in london 
we paid off on johnson because let me ask you who won the 
race said gene mayday manager of little caesars johnson 
did we didnt ask whether he took drugs or not it doesnt matter 
he crossed the finish line first 
for betting purposes johnson was the winner is the winner 
and will be the winner agreed art manteris director of the las 
vegas hilton sports book 
bachman said less than 10000 was bet on the two men at 
harrahs with most of the money on lewis at 5 to 6 odds the line 
on johnson was 11 to 10 and was 3 to 1 on any one else in the 
100meter race 
odds of 5 to 6 would pay off 5 for each 6 bet plus the amount 
of the wager 
half of the johnson bettors were paid off before harrahs 
decided on the refund but bachman would not say how much money 
that involved 
we just lost in the deal because we paid off some bets and 
then we had to refund too he said 
in the future harrahs probably will inform bettors at the 
window that the winner at the finish line will be paid off bachman 
said

suits 
the fourday discovery mission will be the first shuttle flight 
since challenger exploded in a fireball 73 seconds after liftoff 
from the same launch pad on jan 28 1986 the accident ceded 
manned space to the soviet union which has put 16 cosmonauts into 
orbit since then aboard six flights 
asked what would be going through his mind as the count ticks 
down the centers deputy director tom utsman said ill be 
saying that hopefully we have done all the right things that we 
havent taken any shortcuts that we havent overlooked anything 
id be a liar if i said i wasnt nervous he said but i 
also am confident 
as a result of investigations since the accident the shuttle 
fleet and nasas management have undergone major changes the 
shuttle itself has had 210 modifications including the addition of 
an escape system that would enable the crew to bail out if the ship 
had to ditch in the ocean the escape system would not have saved 
the challenger crew 
the shuttle booster rockets blamed for the challenger tragedy 
have undergone an 800 million redesign 
because of the many changes hauck said the mission is 
considered a test flight well probably see some surprises but 
i dont think theyll be lifethreatening surprises he said 
many astronauts and nasa officials have been immensely 
frustrated with the time it took to fly the shuttle again after 
three apollo astronauts were killed in a launch pad test in 1967 
nasa was flying again within 21 months and on the moon nine months 
after that 
mission specialist john m lounge one of the discovery 
astronauts said the worst thing you can do to an airplane is put 
it in a hangar for three years and make a lot of changes when you 
bring that airplane back the first thing you do is a test flight 
to wring out every system and find the surprises i expect well 
see some but im satisfied all the changes are necessary and that 
well have a safer vehicle 
lounge and haucks colleagues on the flight are pilot richard o 
covey and mission specialists david c hilmers and george d 
nelson 
americas space future could depend on a safe mission 
we have to be successful said kennedy space center 
director forrest mccartney the nation could not withstand 
another accident like challenger 
you cant totally take the risk out of something like this 
mccartney said in an interview but in those last hours of the 
count ill know that we have done everything we know how to make 
this a safe flight that we have reduced the risks as much as we 
possibly can 
two problems that surfaced in recent days appeared to be 
resolved 
one had to do with a booster rocket being readied for a twin of 
the tracking and data relay satellite the discovery crew is to 
launch six hours after liftoff a cut on a small sealing oring on 
the booster rocket destined for flight next february was found to 
have a tiny cut apparently caused by a metal burr 
engineers worked overnight and said tests of rings deliberately 
flawed showed they would not leak the cut apparently was inflicted 
during installation and does not represent a design or 
manufacturing defect the engineers said 
the other snag involved the scraping off of a layer of paint on 
one of discoverys small jet thrusters used to position the shuttle 
in orbit but it was found that underlayers of the thermal paint 
were intact and that the thruster could be bypassed if need be

the bulky orange pressure suits are 
far less comfortable than the coveralls shuttle crews once wore 
and they take forever to put on but they could be lifesavers for 
discoverys astronauts 
the 75pound suits never before worn into space are to be worn 
only during takeoff and landing and come packed with parachutes 
lifeboats and radios they are part of a new escape system 
including a telescoping pole and an escape hatch that was devised 
in the aftermath of challenger although it would not have helped 
in the disaster that killed seven astronauts 
its not a very comfortable thing to walk around in but its 
got a lot of capabilities said roly rice project engineer for 
the escape system at nasas johnson space center

a senate tax bill that for two years has been 
gathering everything but momentum is now hung up over fears that 
president reagan will accuse its backers of favoring higher taxes 
in comparison with the giant 1986 tax overhaul legislation 
which shifted 125 billion in taxes from individuals to 
corporations over five years this bill is peanuts with a 
threeyear price tag of 23 billion 
it was launched in the summer of 1986 just to correct errors and 
clear up ambiguities in the new tax law it since has become the 
vehicle for dozens of other tax provisions whose beneficiaries 
include farmers workers who receive education assistance from 
their employers and taxpayers involved in disputes with the 
internal revenue service

if george bush becomes president he would be 
the 12th episcopalian to hold that office more than of any other 
denomination if michael dukakis wins he would be the first greek 
orthodox in the oval office 
both are lifelong members of their faiths 
a regular churchgoer bush is a member of st martins 
episcopal church in houston he also is a close friend of 
evangelist billy graham who spends time with bush each year at his 
summer home in kennebunkport maine 
there bush is a vestrymen at st annes episcopal church as 
well as maintaining active participation in the houston 
congregation in washington he attends various episcopal churches 
including the national cathedral 
in his family faith was a given he writes god just was 
there was no debate about it 
dukakis is a lifelong member of annunication cathedral in 
boston a regular contributor and frequent worshipper there 
attending on major holidays and sometimes on sundays 
he comes as often or more often than some other members 
says the cathedral dean the rev athanasian demos its not as 
often as i wish id like everyone to be here every sunday 
under church rules dukakis is formally barred from taking 
communion because of his marriage to a nonchristian his wife 
kitty is a jew but this is regarded a pastoral issue between 
worshipper and priest 
george stephanopoulos a boston spokesman for dukakis says 
the governor considers himself a religious man and close to the 
church religion is not something he takes lightly 
he is a personal friend of archbishop iakovos primate of greek 
orthodoxy in the americas iakovos had been pastor of the boston 
cathedral when dukakis was a lad in sunday school and his parents 
were active members 
the archbishop whom dukakis calls his spiritual father has 
often counseled with him over the years and met and prayed with him 
since he began his campaign for the presidency 
his wife who does not attend services with him recently told 
the atlanta jewish times 
we have mutual respect for the other in terms of the right and 
privilege to practice their religion as they see fit and weve 
done that 
i think im a stronger jew for having married out of my 
religion i feel very strongly about my ethnic and religious 
background and that has not diminished 
michael feels very strongly about his religious background 
and we made a decision before we were married that we would raise 
our children with both they have shared in the richness of 
both our heritages 
dukakis has drawn occasional jabs from within orthodoxy for not 
condemning abortion and for his marriage to a jew he was called an 
apostate by republican policy analyst james g jatras a greek 
orthodox 
however the greek orthodox community generally has seemed 
widely supportive of dukakis the archbishop while refraining from 
political endorsements has strongly affirmed dukakis steady 
churchmanship 
the candidate has encountered opposition and frequent picking by 
antiabortion forces like many other politicians he says he 
personally opposes abortion but doesnt want to impose that 
position on others 
he also has opposed tuition tax credits for students in private 
or religious schools and is against capital punishment 
bush on the other hand favors capital punishment and tuition 
tax credits and would outlaw abortion except to save the life of 
the mother or in cases of rape or incest 
he also wants daily prayer in the public schools and required 
recital of the pledge of allegiance 
these positions have gained him strong support from some 
evangelicals including moral majority chairman jerry falwell 
after a meeting with a group of evangelical leaders in july 
former southern baptist president adrian rogers of memphis tenn 
said i appreciate very much the bush campaign reaching out to 
evangelicals 
however prior to the current campaign bush at times has 
criticized some fundamentalists for trying to impose their will 
and dictate their own interpretation of morality on the rest of 
society 
once when pressed by an evangelical interviewer about whether 
he has had a bornagain conversion experience he said yes 
i believe in jesus and i have accepted him as my personal savior 
however he expressed annoyance at those who demand that all 
christians must know the exact day and hour their conversion 
occurred 
of the nations 38 presidents to date 11 have been 
episcopalians six presbyterians four methodists three 
congregationalists now united church of christ two unitarians 
two dutch reformed two baptists two quakers two of the christian 
church disciples of christ and one roman catholic 
two including one of the most deeply religious presidents of 
american history abraham lincoln and the man who succeeded him 
after his assassination andrew johnson never affiliated with any

like the four other schools in this most 
troubled district in massachusetts burke elementary is awaiting 
its messiah if the savior arrives this fall it wont be a moment 
too soon 
children in this overcrowded 107yearold red brick and wood 
school eat at their desks there is no cafeteria the playground is 
unsafe because slate slides off the roof the wooden stairs are a 
blatant fire hazard what passes for an auditorium contains what 
passes for a library and what passes for a speech therapy room 
test scores graduation rates and teacher salaries all rank 
among the worst in the state this impoverished district on boston 
harbor that mixes hispanic and southeast asian immigrants with 
workingclass whites spends just 2600 per pupil thats about 
1600 less than the national average and only 200 more than 
arkansas the lowest spending state 
fiftynine percent of the districts 3300 schoolchildren come 
from families where english is a second language if spoken at all 
says superintendent frank herlihy 
chelsea hasnt built a new school since 1923 and buildings like 
burke are completely inadequate in 1988 
five miles away john silber sharptongued president of boston 
university says he can change all that and gain prestige for his 
school in the bargain he has offered to manage the chelsea school 
district for 10 years and transform it into a model for urban 
school renewal 
if silber has his way his university would administer and 
finance a sort of marshall plan for chelsea schools mothers and 
pregnant teens would be counseled on nutrition and child rearing 
curricula would be revamped new schools would be built old ones 
renovated learning plans would be tailored to individual students 
there would be afterschool programs for all ages 
if silber achieves even a fraction of this it would be a 
national first a private university governing a public school 
system a fullscale social experiment aimed at transforming the 
fortunes of an entire downtrodden community from birth to old age 
i dont think its extraneous to the life of a university to 
be caught serving the community silber said in an interview 
well be making good on a lot of palaver a lot of talk that 
comes out of washington actions continue to speak louder than 
words 
many in chelsea are thrilled at the prospect of a helping hand 
but others especially teachers are bitter and mistrustful 
because they say university officials only recently saw fit to 
include them in discussions 
still others question whether its right for a city to grant 
control of its schools to a private body no matter how 
wellintentioned 
i dont think the school committee should turn over its 
authority to any private institution isnt that what democracy is 
about said elizabeth mcbride a member of the chelsea school 
committee 
in other words big questions remain before the buchelsea 
contract is a done deal where is the money coming from for bus 
grandiose reform plan who would ultimately be in charge 
concretely and specifically nothing has been settled there 
is no contract between chelsea and bu said paul devlin head of 
the massachusetts federation of teachers 
it began three years ago when 30year veteran school 
committeeman andrew p quigley independently approached silber with 
the idea of managing chelseas schools the university agreed to 
produce a comprehensive audit of the schools and develop a plan to 
revive the system 
the districts biggest problem has always been money but 1980s 
statewide taxlimiting proposition 2 hit chelsea hard funds for 
supplies were cut in half and music art physical education and 
counseling staff were laid off 
said ed greenberg a 73yearold retiree and civic leader who 
recently attended his 55th chelsea high school reunion the 
community just doesnt have the money or the expertise to turn the 
schools around this has been going on for 30 years now things are 
bad things are bad 
in a 231page proposal issued last summer bu offered a 
messianic vision of chelsea schools 10 years from now with bu at 
the helm 
chelsea schools would boast family learning centers 
addressing the education health and nutrition needs of parents and 
children alike from birth to adulthood 
curricula from kindergarten through 12th grade would be 
overhauled the first year and teachers would design individual 
learning plans for students 
community service would be a graduation requirement working 
with the city health department students parents and city leaders 
would end chelseas drug problems 
teacher pay currently lowest in the state at 
18000to30000 would be made competitive with incentive pay 
and added responsibilities for the best teachers 
by the fifth year bu projects a 20 percent improvement in 
thirdgrade reading writing and math test scores the dropout rate 
will be down to 10 percent from the current 15 percent the 
elementary schools will be freshly renovated a new high school 
ready for students

currently the buchelsea relationship is defined by a set of 
resolutions adopted by the school committee july 26 in essence an 
agreement committing both sides to work in good faith toward a 
final contract 
the key difference between the town and the university lies in 
who would run the schools the plan the university submitted in 
june proposed setting up a fivemember management committee with bu 
holding a 32 majority the chelsea school committee countered with 
a proposal that the management team consist of the existing 
sevenmember school committee and three bu representatives 
peter r greer who this summer became dean of bus school of 
education proposed a compromise sept 21 giving the chelsea 
school committee power to override bus management decisions with a 
twothirds vote he also suggested an advisory council be set up 
with parents teachers and townspeople passing along concerns to 
the university managers 
if chelsea endorses that plan the legislature must still 
approve a transfer of power from the community to the university 
chances are considered good 
beyond those uncertainties is a residue of resentment among some 
school committeemen and classroom teachers who contend that until 
very recently the university had dealt with them highhandedly 
when the bu people first came in here it felt like a grand 
jury with rapidfire questions said richard denning principal 
of prattville school another of chelseas antiquated elementary 
schools bu is going to find that its more difficult than it 
appears from my point of view we need help but not a takeover 
the only time ive seen bu people was a 15second walk through 
my classroom said christine siewko a veteran firstgrade 
teacher at burke i feel if theyre going to do a decent job 
there they are going to need teacher input 
bu is biting off more than it realizes said phyllis 
nazzaro the lead teacher of special education at chelsea high 
school we have pta meetings and only four or five parents show 
up we know the problems 
even greer who won high marks as school superintendent in 
portland maine in 197986 and served as a federal undersecretary 
of education for two years before joining bu acknowledges the 
university could have better explained its plans 
greer has promised to involve teachers and parents more in 
discussions and both sides say hes already soothed some of the 
hurt feelings 
still these questions remain 
where is the money coming from 
silber says hes confident he can get the legislature and 
private foundations to donate the 50 million he estimates is 
needed to build new schools and renovate existing ones and an 
additional 2 million or so a year to raise salaries and meet other 
operating costs of the plan 
when john silber walks into the ford foundation we know they 
are going to listen quigley said 
so far said greer the university has gotten a commitment only 
from papa ginos pizza chain to supply free pies for good students 
and 10000 from a minneapolis firm to help refine the districts 
computer network 
who would be in charge 
greer despite his proposal to give the school committee power 
to override university decisions makes it clear the university 
expects the upper hand 
bu shouldnt be asked to put its reputation and resources on 
the line and not have a certain authority he said 
silber bristles at suggestions that the university wants to 
take over chelseas schools 
the existing school committee he insisted will continue to 
have a supervisory role an evaluative role a consultative role 
and if they decide that were not doing the job right they can 
fire us 
bu has also stated it would assume the role as collective 
bargaining agent said donald menzies president of the chelsea 
teachers union we of course will take a long hard look at 
that 
silber has tried with mixed success to quell teachers concerns 
he insists that teachers and parents would be in the thick of any 
decisions to change curricula or classroom life 
it doesnt mean that because bu is involved that therefore 
comandante silber is going to say this is the way its going to 
be he said were not stupid we know perfectly well that if 
we designed a curriculum in which youve had no part that you wont 
teach it you cant make a teacher teach anything but if theyve 
had a hand in its development theyll want a hand in its 
realization 
can bu succeed 
personalities could play a decisive role 
silber is admired for raising the stature of boston university 
but is viewed with trepidation by some teachers because of his 
often stormy relations with his own faculty and his abrasive 
dealings with campus labor unions 
greer may be the key in portland he earned a reputation as a 
firstclass educator and skilled negotiator who welcomed community 
involvement 
with greer bu is finally starting to listen to us said 
teacher union head menzies

if youre in the same position as most consumer 
borrowers financial advisers say you should be aware that time is 
not on your side 
in the late 1970s and early 1980s there was a real incentive to 
borrow heavily since inflation was running at a rapid rate you 
paid off loans with cheaper and cheaper dollars as time passed 
and every nickel of interest you paid was deductible on your tax 
return no matter what you used the money for 
but those days are long gone interest rates though they may be 
nominally lower now than they were several years ago are actually 
very high in comparison to todays inflation rate 
and the deduction for consumer interest on creditcard 
purchases auto loans and so forth is fast disappearing 
under the tax reform act of 1986 just 40 percent of consumer 
interest will be deductible on 1988 tax returns 
the percentage drops to 20 in 1989 to 10 in 1990 and to zero 
thereafter 
if you have not already done so you should consider repaying 
existing personal debts as soon as possible to avoid additional 
nondeductible interest expense the accounting firm of kpmg peat 
marwick says in a booklet on 1988 yearend tax planning 
that goes especially for creditcard debt analysts say 
in some areas of the country competition between lenders has 
pushed interest rates on outstanding creditcard balances down from 
their former levels but according to the organization bank card 
holders of america the average rate still stands at 183 percent 
if you have some money you want to invest for an assured high 
return suggests the financial advisory donoghues money letter 
what better use for it than to pay off credit card debt 
we dare you to find another 183 percent sure thing today 
the newsletter says it just doesnt make sense to pay this kind 
of interest 
a special problem can arise with a car loan adds jerry karbon 
of the credit union national association a trade group in madison 
wis 
since many cars are bought today with loans extending over five 
six or even seven years their owners often face an unpleasant 
surprise when they prepare to trade them in for new models 
the cars value has depreciated as fast as or faster than the 
loan balance has been reduced so that the vehicle has no effective 
tradein value 
paying for the car over a longer period reduces the monthly 
payment but it repays the loan so slowly that it may take three 
years or more before there is any positive equity in the vehicle 
karbon says 
the timehonored way to save money on loans still applies aim 
for the highest monthly payment you can afford and the shortest 
repayment time 
in the case of auto loans it will pay off on your next 
purchase as well by increasing the net value of your tradein he 
says 
the donoghue organization even goes so far as to suggest paying 
off your mortgage faster than the loan agreement calls for if you 
can manage to do so 
on most mortgages and other debts secured by a home the 
interest you pay remains fully deductible nevertheless if you can 
work out an accelerated payment schedule with the lender the 
newsletter points out you can save yourself a lot of interest 
expense and increase your equity in your home 
that equity becomes an asset you can tap some time in the future 
for instance to pay for childrens college tuition 
as the donoghue analysts say the more equity you have in your 
home the more useful a home equity loan will be

more than two years after president 
corazon aquino took office with a vow to protect human rights her 
government has yet to shake off the legacy of repressive rule left 
by the exiled ferdinand e marcos 
officials say the campaign to end abuses and build confidence 
among the public has been hampered by a widespread distrust of 
government in the wake of 20 years of marcos rule 
its a carryover mentality said abelardo aportadera of the 
human rights commission whenever you have government 
investigating you always hesitate 
reliable figures on human rights violations during marcos time 
and during mrs aquinos years are virtually impossible to 
determine because of differences in definition poor recordkeeping 
and varying standards used by both the government and private 
groups for confirming allegations 
but criticism of the aquino governments human rights record has 
come not only from social activists and leftists but also from the 
hierarchy of the influential roman catholic church 
in a stinging commentary in august the countrys bishops 
appealed for more discipline in the military and for the 
disbanding of vigilante groups established by the armed forces to 
help fight communist guerrillas 
amnesty international and the international commission of 
jurists have also expressed concern over unresolved human rights 
violations under the aquino administration both organizations have 
cited an increasing number of unsolved killings of human rights 
workers 
in a report this year another group the churchbacked task 
force detainees claimed the number of human rights violations in 
1987 equaled or surpassed those for 1985 marcos last full year in 
power 
augusto catelo chief of the human rights commissions records 
division said 2016 cases have been filed since the commission was 
established by mrs aquino in march 1986 
he said the figure includes cases such as financial claims from 
private companies which have been reclassified as nonhuman 
rights cases but have yet to be stricken from the original list of 
civil liberties abuses 
but human rights groups say the governments figures are too 
low the task force claims that in 1987 alone 7444 people were 
arrested without warrants it said an additional 602 people were 
tortured and that 284 people were killed or wounded in 29 
massacres of civilians by vigilantes the military or armed 
private security forces 
more than 18000 families were forced from their homes the task 
force said by comparison the task force said 7253 people were 
arrested illegally and 236 families were forced from their homes in 
1985 
the task force added however that the number of those slain by 
security forces had declined sharply since mrs aquino took office 
aportadera says differences in datagathering methods were 
behind the discrepancy he also claimed the task force and other 
human rights groups are quick to label reported abuses as 
violations without confirmation 
for them a mere report with some minimum requirement will 
already be a violation of human rights he said in our case 
no if theres a report of massacre help us get the data 
the numbers and then we put it in our file 
i think it is still not that grave the situation before and 
now i think now what is positive is we are getting cooperation 
from the military and police they are more receptive now to 
integrating human rights values in the armed forces 
despite government efforts to educate soldiers on human rights 
officials say some still abuse civilians including those 
suspected of links to the new peoples army the communist 
guerrilla organization 
major abuses include the killing of 13 protesters at a land 
reform march in manila in january 1987 the massacre of 17 
civilians in lupao the following month and unsolved slayings of 
prominent leftists including rolando olalia in 1986 and leandro 
alejandro in september 1987 
the governments inability so far to identify or prosecute 
suspects in those incidents has tarnished the reputation not only 
of the human rights commission but also of the countrys entire 
legal establishment 
mrs aquinos order for the commission to investigate human 
rights violations by guerrillas as well as by soldiers has 
reinforced doubts on whether the agency can serve its purpose 
critics of the policy say the rebels commit atrocities but 
believe the commission should focus its attention on violations by 
the military police and others charged with protecting the 
citizenry 
personally human rights violations can only be committed by 
government said aportadera in the context of international 
human rights these atrocities that communist rebels commit are 
crimes common crimes falling under the purview of rebellion 
so far the commission has completed the investigation of 218 
cases which were referred to the courts in a partial review of 
the agencys records however aportadera says he has found only 
one soldier who has been punished for a maltreatment and torture 
case 
the element of distrust is there aportadera said you 
still have some elements within government that continue the 
practices of marcos

kopkamtib was abolished recently by a 
keppres which created bakorstanas to take its place 
the acronym some would call it alphabet soup is alive and 
kicking in indonesia what happened recently in translation from 
indonesian acronymania is this 
the operational command for the restoration of security and 
order kopkamtib or komando operasi pemulihan keamanan dan 
ketertiban was abolished by a presidential decree keppres or 
keputusan president which created in its place the coordinating 
agency for assisting the strengthening of national stability 
bakorstanas or badan koordinasi bantuan pemantapan stabilitas 
nasional 
acronyms and abbreviations are a national craze used to 
condense unwieldy phrases but serving in many other cases to 
compound confusion 
for one thing it is common if not preferable to use the first 
syllable instead of the first letter of words as with keppres 
the main political party is called golkar which is short for 
golongan karya and comes out in english as functional groups 
headline writers delight in the convenience offered by the 
thousands of short forms but to the uninitiated the front pages of 
indonesian newspapers resemble a lexicographers nightmare 
acronyms also are found in telephone books and on the doors of 
government offices standard dictionaries offer no help 
many say the use of acronyms first spread during the 
administration 194966 of president sukarno known familiarly as 
bung karno for brother sukarno 
during the sukarno years the habit was applied to english 
phrases as well as the national tongue bahasa indonesia 
the term neocolonial imperialism was cut to necolim 
a sports tournament for third world athletes became known as 
ganefo games of the newly emerging forces 
communist china became cinkom 
blame or credit for entrenching linguistic short cuts is usually 
pinned on the armed forces or the abri 
as early as 1976 professor takdir alisjahbana warned that the 
influential military was coining so many acronyms that the standard 
of bahasa indonesia might deteriorate he said such usage added 
nothing to the stock of new ideas but only increased the burden on 
the memory 
onemagazine editor cautioned his staff about shortening jaksa 
agung attorney general to jagung which means popcorn 
there are acronyms for most government departments and senior 
officials 
the presidents personal assistants are aspri short for 
asisten pribadi president 
the alphabet soup is sometimes flavored with numbers 
p3 is what people sometimes call the opposition political group 
partai persatuan pembangunan united development party 
then theres bp7 badan pembinaan pendidikan pelaksanaan 
pedoman penghayatan dan pengamalan pancasila 
thats the board for guidance on the means of teaching 
guidelines for the true interpretation and implementation of the 
state ideology

not so long ago such massachusetts communities as 
lowell and fitchburg were aging decaying industrial dinosaurs 
factories were closing manufacturing parks were empty and downtown 
stores were shuttered 
people had to leave to find work in taunton the largest 
landed city in the state with 50 square miles they even had to 
leave to find a movie theater 
mayor richard johnson recalls that things got so bad that 
taunton not only had no theaters it had no hotel unemployment 
ballooned to 14 percent 
the community decline has largely been reversed in a booming 
economic turnaround that has revived massachusetts cities and towns 
like taunton 35 miles to the south of boston fitchburg to the 
west and lowell to the north 
he started putting people on buses johnson says of gov 
michael dukakis personal effort to spark a revival 
dukakis claims a large measure of credit for this 
massachusetts miracle as he campaigns for the white house 
economists generally applaud his efforts but agree that 
circumstances and pure luck have made life better for rita pires 
al souza tom clark and thousands like them even as dukakis 
helped things along 
i was hurting financially said souza who was forced into 
retirement at age 55 but found work in tauntons revival i think 
hes dukakis done well for this community 
but the living isnt so easy for the parsons and parhams and 
many other bluecollar families who cant afford to buy a home 
because the prosperity has sent bostonarea house prices soaring 
between them the parsons who have three children make 21000 a 
year the parhams earn 35000 
i feel like it has gone down terry parson said of her 
standard of living in a state where jobs are so plentiful that 
mcdonalds is offering 7 an hour i feel im going backward 
ive been priced out of the market 
the parham family lives in a high crime area and the parents 
worry for the safety of their 7yearold daughter we have to 
stay here until things get a little better for us said betty 
parham i dont let my kid out unless i take her to the park or 
somewhere although the rate of violent crime in massachusetts 
has dropped and is low among major industrial states its no 
solace for the parhams 
its just unsafe for her to go in front of the door betty 
parham said of her daughter 
harvard economist ronald f ferguson said that while life is 
better under dukakis its best for higher income people its 
not that the lower income people dont have jobs but the cost of 
living remains high and it makes it difficult for them to make ends 
meet 
economists say dukakis took advantage of the sudden prosperity 
and benefited by association the dukakis campaign has been airing 
television ads that boast he reversed the states economic slide 
in one ad an announcer proclaims 
he turned around a 10year economic slide and created a boom 
that has made massachusetts one of the hottest economies in the 
country he brought people together created over 400000 jobs and 
pushed personal income to the highest levels in the nation he 
erased a massive deficit balanced 10 budgets in a row and cut 
taxes five times it wasnt a miracle it was leadership 
that may be reaching too far when the state was on the brink of 
disaster in the early 1970s with the unemployment rate at more than 
11 percent a loss of more than 100000 manufacturing jobs in 
textiles and apparel and huge budget deficits no one not even 
dukakis knew what forces were at work to change the economy from 
rusting lowtech to gleaming hitech according to david lampe he 
directs the industrial liaison program at the massachusetts 
institute of technology 
what happened next most people agree had little to do with 
dukakis the computer industry found the smart people and places 
like mit and harvard in a state rich with talent and schools 
commercial banks and venture capitalists were willing to bet on 
them a big market was waiting 
that was the engine of change the source of new jobs lampe 
said the state had little role in causing the change no 
governor can engineer an economic change as large as the one called 
the massachusetts miracle it evolved out of the resources in 
this region including a concentration of universities and a large 
number of defense contracts 
tauntons mayor johnson a democrat but no ally of dukakis says 
the governor committed money to link that city to interstate 
highway 495 a key to its economic recovery dukakis he says 
found companies looking to expand and arranged tours for their 
executives 
one of those executives was john cc fan a physicist from mit 
who didnt know dukakis and who had no idea where taunton was 
backed by venture capital fan a chinese immigrant had just 
formed the kopin corp which makes wafers for the electronics 
industry 
i dont know how the governor knew i had started the 
company said fan he called me at mit and asked me to go down 
and see him at the statehouse he encouraged me to go to taunton 
because of a new industrial park the financial package was very 
attractive 
johnson says the citys industrial park grew from six companies 
in 1982 to 52 today creating 5000 new jobs that dropped the 
unemployment rate to less than 4 percent now 
tauntons population grew by 5000 to nearly 50000 new tax 
revenues allowed the city to invest 6 million in its public 
buildings and schools and to replace more than 50 miles of 
100yearold water lines 
down the road at fitchburg which received state and federal 
funds to bring its downtown back to life mayor jeffrey bean said 
people seem to be doing much better now than they were 10 years 
ago these grants and programs encouraged business to come into 
massachusetts 
hubert jones dean of the school of social work at boston 
university says dukakis did a good job in increasing state 
government contracts to minority organizations and in improving 
human services 
dukakis pumped more money into human services than any other 
administration in my memory jones said mike dukakis has been 
a good governor the second time around i think he came back and 
corrected some big mistakes

pope john paul ii is so welltraveled that 
the focus has shifted to where he hasnt visited instead of where 
he has already stopped 
since setting out for the dominican republic and mexico three 
months after assuming the papacy 10 years ago john paul has made 
39 foreign pilgrimages stopping in 72 countries 
easily the most traveled pope in history he has flown some 
370000 miles including his trip to southern africa in 
midseptember thats like traveling from the earth to the moon and 
more than halfway back 
but if he has visited every continent except antartica he has 
yet to visit a number of key spots for varying reasons they 
include the soviet union china cuba and the holy land 
on the september trip john paul was to skirt south africa on 
the fivecountry pilgrimage but found himself stopping briefly in 
the segregated country when bad weather closed in the airport in 
lesotho the pope said the time wasnt ripe to visit south africa 
but that he wanted to make a regular visit there someday 
early in his pontificate john paul described himself as a 
pilgrim messenger who would travel the world to see his flock he 
has kept his word far surpassing pope paul vi the first jet age 
pontiff who became known as the apostle on the move 
paul made nine overseas trips between 1964 and 1970 when weary 
and 72 he halted all foreign travel 
john paul has made nine trips to latin america alone reflecting 
the importance the vatican attaches to a region expected to contain 
half the worlds roman catholics by the turn of the century 
he has also paid four visits to africa where the church has 
been making inroads as well as three pilgrimages to his native 
poland and two to the united states 
the trips are central to john pauls papacy he has bristled at 
suggestions he should spend more time at the vatican vatican 
statistics say he is away less than 8 percent of his pontificate 
or that the trips cost too much 
he chose a bishops conference in mexico on his first trip to 
reject marxistinspired liberation theology he influenced the mood 
of his fellow poles during his 1979 pilgrimage that helped lead to 
the birth of the solidarity free trade union and he expounded 
church teaching to americans in 1987 saying that dissent was 
incompatible with being a good catholic 
still to come are a trip later this year to strasbourg france 
to address the european parliament and a visit to scandinavia next 
year 
john pauls hopes of visiting the soviet union have not yet been 
realized he has disclosed that hes been prevented from visiting 
lithuania the roman catholic stronghold in the soviet union and 
insists that he must be allowed to visit with his flock on any 
pilgrimage 
the holy land is an especially delicate case paul vi made a 
whirlwind visit to israel and jordan in 1964 but that was three 
years before israel took over predominantly arab east jerusalem and 
the west bank in the 1967 war 
the vatican has not established diplomatic relations with israel 
and john paul has stressed that the palestinians like the jews 
have a right to a homeland 
the vatican says it is premature for the pope to visit apartheid 
south africa and communist cuba there has been no invitation from 
china which broke relations with the vatican in 1957 and 
established its own breakaway catholic church

nearly a year after the crash of 1987 wall 
street is still retrenching and recuperating 
the growth that doubled the number of jobs in the securities 
industry from 1979 to mid1987 has given way to layoffs mergers 
and costcutting 
stock prices have staged a modest rally this year recovering 
some of the huge losses they suffered in the slide that culminated 
in a record 226 percent drop for the dow jones industrial average 
on black monday oct 19 
but the mood and tempo of the marketplace still bear little 
resemblance to the bull market that prevailed for five years before 
the collapse 
in a business that thrives on activity buying and selling that 
generates commissions and trading profits volume has lagged all 
year even shortterm plays like stockindex arbitrage and 
maneuvers to capture dividends have lately died down 
if those gimmick transactions and trades between dealers most 
of which dont bring the street much revenue are excluded john 
connolly an analyst at dean witter reynolds inc estimates that 
volume is down 30 percent or more from a year ago 
business is contracting he said mutual fund sales have 
stagnated pension fund managers are struggling with meager cash 
inflows and lots of plan terminations 
some steps have been taken and others proposed to strengthen 
the mechanism of the marketplace which was sorely taxed in the 
worst moments of the crash 
for example the national association of securities dealers the 
organization that operates and regulates the overthecounter 
market has adopted new systems and rules to keep 
computertocomputer trading going when the pressure on the market 
intensifies 
the new york stock exchange and the chicago mercantile exchange 
have come up with plans for circuit breakers designed to 
prevent breakdowns in runaway markets 
many observers see measures like these as single pieces in a 
larger puzzle still unsolved by the financial community 
the no 1 issue is to restore investor confidence said 
william schreyer chairman of merrill lynch amp co 
the crash clearly left a lasting imprint on individual investors 
the socalled retail customers who were already a diminishing 
breed 
an opinion research corp survey conducted for the nasd in may 
and june found that 39 percent of the respondents had grown more 
conservative in their investment strategies 
more than 60 percent described the stock market as riskier for 
individual investors than it was a year earlier 
the crash brought a sudden halt to more than a decade of rapid 
growth for the discount brokerage business which caters especially 
to affluent knowledgeable individual investors and which depends 
heavily on commissions from that clientele 
in the first quarter of 1988 according to the securities 
industry association wall streets main trade group retail 
commissions fell 27 percent from the comparable period a year 
earlier 
if individual investors were frightened by the crash why didnt 
they cut back drastically on their spending causing a slump in the 
consumer economy 
the answer seems to be that as a group they hadnt plunged 
heavily into the market before the crash 
at merrill lynch one of the biggest fullservice firms 
catering to the public schreyer said only 25 percent of customers 
money was in stocks going into the debacle 
assets in those accounts stood at about 250 billion on sept 30 
of last year he said a month later they had fallen to 238 
billion but they since have rebounded to about 260 billion 
far more important than individuals as a driving force in the 
stock market are money managers at investing institutions who 
handle pension funds and other large pools of assets 
while investing in stocks or bonds may be optional for an 
individual professional portfolio managers operate in a different 
environment they are paid to put money to work within a relatively 
limited range of choices 
but since the crash money managers also have been content to 
sit with largerthanusual cash reserves parked in shortterm 
interestbearing investments such as treasury bills 
thanks in part to inflation worries and recent credit tightening 
by the federal reserve these lowrisk securities now offer yields 
of 75 to 8 percent or more 
in strong stock markets most money managers fear nothing more 
than underperformance failing to keep pace with their 
competitors and the rise of the market averages if it goes on for 
very long underperformance is a sure road to losing accounts and 
maybe your job as well 
in the 198287 bull market many observers say the performance 
race helped keep the advance going far beyond any level that made 
rational sense 
in todays cautious environment the pressure to perform while 
still present is far less intense in many a strategy meeting 
these days the talk focuses on limiting risk 
by the logic that makes the market work declines in stock 
prices end and new bull markets are born when worries are rampant 
cash reserves are high and everybody has gotten out of stocks in 
that gloomy setting there is nobody left to sell 
some wall streeters argue that the market is now at or nearing 
such a point but others arent so sure 
its too late to be really bearish and too early to become 
bullish said raymond f devoe jr an analyst at the firm of 
legg mason wood walker inc 
there will occur at some stage a major turning point said 
anthony tabell at delafield harvey tabell inc in princeton nj 
it will be accompanied by maximum pessimism and consequent large 
holdings of cash 
however there is nothing to stop the current climate of 
skepticism from continuing for a protracted period it is difficult 
to tell therefore when and where that turning point will be 
in the meantime optimists in the financial world tide 
themselves over with the thought or at least the hope that most 
of the damage from the crash has been confined to wall street 
perhaps it was just an extreme manifestation of the markets 
continuous upanddown cycle the end of an era for wall street 
but not the end of the line for prosperity in the industrialized 
world 
it always repeats itself said schreyer a market recovery 
awaits he contends and i think its going to be sooner rather 
than later 
i dont think this malaise is going to last for years

the last time the united states had a recession 
bullets were flying in the falkland islands and barney clark was 
preparing to get the worlds first artificial heart 
that was 1982 ancient history by economists standards in 
november of that year the economy began a powerful expansion that 
is about to become the longest in us peacetime history 
next month barring calamity the expansion will tie the 
peacetime record set under george washington from mid1790 to 
mid1796 economists do not foresee a recession until next year at 
the earliest 
the mississippi river may have receded from its banks this 
summer but the 1980s economy just keeps rolling along in spite of 
bad weather deficits and the worst stock market crash on record 
on the afternoon of oct 19 1987 with half a trillion dollars 
in stock wealth suddenly evaporated there were widespread fears 
that the united states could be on the brink of another great 
depression 
those fears are legitimized in a new study by christina d romer 
of the university of california at berkeley who concludes that the 
uncertainty generated by the 1929 crash was indeed a major factor 
in causing the depression of the 1930s 
uncertainty is worse than knowing the truth no matter how 
bad she quotes the magazine of wall street as having said on 
nov 30 1929 
what saved the economy from disaster a year ago were three main 
things 
the federal reserve which flubbed its job in the 1930s had 
the good sense this time to open the money spigots allowing banks 
to borrow freely and preventing the financial system from going 
into gridlock 
consumers kept spending only slightly daunted by the crash 
one reason was obvious in retrospect most americans dont own 
stocks moreover investors losses in stock portfolios were offset 
by gains in bonds which rallied 
the economy withstood the crash because it was and is 
basically healthy in october 1929 a recession had already begun 
so then what caused black monday the answer is simple what 
goes up must come down pumped up by greed and fantasy the stock 
market had gotten too high especially in comparison to the larger 
but less visible bond market which competes for investors dollars 
instead of adjusting to economic reality gradually the way 
theory says it should the market plunged in a chaotic and 
dangerous spiral that was exacerbated by computerdictated selling 
and breakdowns in the trading system 
to be sure those who say oct 19 was a warning thunderclap have 
plenty of evidence on their side 
the trade deficit is a persistent reminder that americans still 
arent winning the battle of international commerce even with a 
devalued currency 
in spite of a record expansion regional recessions have 
occurred in such places as texas louisiana west virginia and 
michigan 
auto workers steelworkers farmers miners and oil drillers 
people who work with their hands have not fared well in the 1980s 
the economys hightech transformation although necessary to 
meet foreign competition is creating a mismatch between the jobs 
that are available and the people who need work at the bottom a 
small underclass seems mired in permanent poverty 
overall living standards are rising but more slowly than they 
used to thats because productivity improvements have slowed down 
for reasons that are not fully understood 
us productivity is growing at an anemic 02 percent annual 
rate compared with 07 percent in west germany and 19 percent in 
japan the organization for economic cooperation and development 
estimates 
most troubling the united states has gone from the worlds 
largest creditor to its biggest debtor debt here is shorthand 
for all sorts of foreign investments including stocks real estate 
and companies 
optimists say foreign money will rebuild america the same way it 
did in the 19th century when london banks financed the railroads 
pessimists respond that americas foreign debt is the result of 
foolish overspending that is going into consumption rather than 
investment 
all debt including the kind americans owe to each other has 
skyrocketed in the 1980s to more than 23 times the gross national 
product bank credit analyst reported recently 
such a topheavy debt ratio has not been seen since the 
depression 
for all the legitimate complaints about the health of the 
economy though it is undeniable that growth is better than 
recession which causes human misery while leaving productive 
resources wastefully unused 
in september 1982 the tail end of the last recession the 
jobless rate peaked at a 42year high of 101 percent today 
unemployment and inflation are bouncing between 5 percent and 6 
percent 
while europe has stagnated and japans worldbeating growth has 
slowed down the united states has created 155 million jobs since 
president reagans inauguration 
economists cant agree why the united states has managed to 
avoid recession for so long one prominent idea which might be 
called the kneejerk theory gives credit to the fast reflexes of 
the bond market 
the kneejerk theory says bond holders have learned to panic at 
any sign of 1970sstyle inflation when the economy shows signs of 
overheating they dump bonds that drives up interest rates which 
dampens the economy preventing an inflationary spiral that would 
lead to a crash 
the deficit theory says the united states is able to avoid a 
recessioninducing runup in interest rates because it is financing 
its high level of spending with foreign borrowing trouble in the 
long run 
according to the new age theory investments in laborsaving 
equipment to cope with the coming labor shortage will allow the 
united states to enjoy both low inflation and a low jobless rate 
aging baby boomers will jack up the low us savings rate 
finally there is the luck theory which explains fortunate 
events ranging from the drop in the dollar which rejuvenated 
exports to the stock market crash itself which knocked down 
interest rates just as they were getting prohibitively high 
when a recession finally does hit it will be unusually severe 
because of the likelihood of rippling defaults on the record 
mountains of debt consider that farm banks and the savings and 
loan industry are in trouble even without a nationwide recession 
the federal budget deficit already high will skyrocket in a 
recession as tax receipts fall and spending goes up 
with the united states removed as an engine of world growth any 
downturn here is likely to spread to latin america and could extend 
to western europe and the far east 
there are plenty of causes for concern but then there always 
are in comparison to what people feared last october things are 
looking surprisingly good

black monday the 500 billion crash heard 
round the world left no craters on main street 
in the first hours and days afterward there were stories of 
people pawning watches and buying gold real estate markets ground 
to a halt and some highfashion clothiers in manhattan 
contemplated fire sales on suspenders 
but one year later such doomsday scenarios have given way to 
more hopeful appraisals 
while the crash instilled caution in the hearts and minds of 
investors cut the value of many stock portfolios and eliminated 
thousands of jobs on wall street other damage has been limited 
across america 
the figures say the nations wealth shrank by the equivalent of 
2000 for every us citizen on oct 19 but the reality was less 
severe in most places 
it was kind of a nonevent as far as we were concerned said 
doug fairweather director of corporate media relations for sears 
roebuck amp co the nations largest retailer 
even in new york the epicenter of the market crash officials 
say the impact on state finances was negligible 
new york is experiencing a revenue shortfall during the 
current fiscal year but really that is a result of changes from 
the federal income tax not related to the stock market said 
ann doyle spokeswoman for the state budget division 
charitable giving did not decline although the rate of increase 
in 1987 was 665 percent compared to an increase of 9 percent the 
year before said david tobin of the national center for charitable 
statistics 
home buying and retail sales slowed in many part of the country 
but other factors rising interest rates and indifference to 
fashion trends for instance were to blame for the sluggishness 
the shock of the stock market crash was mostly absorbed because 
the loss really didnt amount to 2000 per person after all most 
stock is in the hands of the upper crust not average americans 
there was an initial shock but the other shoe never dropped 
for consumers or any of the others of us said sandra shaber of 
the futures group an economic forecasting firm in washington 
thats not to deny that there was a real crash her firm 
estimated that household net worth home equity and financial 
instruments such as stocks and bonds fell at an annual rate of 
222 percent in the last quarter of 1987 
however it bounced up 97 percent in the first quarter of 1988 
and 23 percent in the second quarter 
at the time of the crash panicky investors fled to gold and 
silver traditional havens in perilous times 
dennis lemke president of university avenue coin and stamp in 
madison wis said business returned to normal quickly right 
now precious metals are more in the doldrums than last year 
at investment management and research inc in iowa city iowa 
lois james reported last year that the brokerage kept busy as a 
number of bargainhunters jumped into the market 
these investors who typically pulled 1000 to 2000 out of 
bank savings require a little extra handholding she said last 
week 
they havent seen huge gains but they havent seen huge 
losses either she said when the market goes down they get a 
little panicky 
in iowa she added the crash was not as important to the 
economy as depressed farm earnings and this summers drought 
in colorado where the crash arrived on the heels of falling oil 
prices mayor al sweney of longmont said he felt the crashs impact 
in the annual budget process which he described as the toughest in 
his quarter century in city government 
without a doubt i think the stock market affects the market 
for new construction and for investors who might have been here 
earlier sweney said his city 30 miles north of denver expects 
to attract 1000 new jobs this year but believes those jobs might 
have been filled and working sooner if not for the market 
the mayor a retired city administrator also took a personal 
hit from the crash it affected the pension fund that im drawing 
from he said 
jim birne director of career development and placement at the 
wharton school of the university of pennsylvania saw the crashs 
impact in the declining numbers of mbas going to new york 
thirtyfive percent of whartons 1988 class took jobs in new 
york compared to 42 percent in 1987 17 percent of the class found 
work in investment banking compared to 25 percent a year earlier 
he said 
what the crash did that is good for the students is it taught 
them that industries were risky birne said that was good for 
us it taught people what was going on in their own careers

the third worlds 12 trillion debt should be 
reduced but only in ways that private markets find acceptable 
us treasury secretary nicholas f brady has told world financial 
leaders 
brady also ruled out strategies that would turn over risky loans 
from private banks to creditor banks governments and their 
taxpayers and touted the use of debtequity swaps and other 
innovative devices for reducing debt 
if we embark on a course that involves the transfer of risk 
from the private to the public sector a true and lasting solution 
to the restoration of sustained growth among debtor nations will 
have escaped he said 
brady making his first appearance on an international stage as 
treasury secretary spoke at tuesdays opening formal session of 
the annual meeting of the world bank and the international monetary 
fund the meeting continues through thursday 
most of the ministers of finance from the 151 member government 
are attending the meeting along with thousands of representatives 
of banking and industry 
brady left for washington right after his speech giving no 
public indication whether or not he was criticizing a japanese 
debtrelief proposal that would allow some latin american debt to 
be converted into bonds with lengthened repayment terms 
brady defended the socalled baker plan which calls for 
providing new loans to developing countries that enact economic 
liberalization policies the plan was devised by his successor 
former treasury secretary james a baker iii 
the united states regards with skepticism proposals that may 
appear to conform to the basic principles of the debt strategy but 
which in practice will produce only an illusion of progress 
brady said indeed such proposals will make the debt problem 
intractable 
without singling out any idea brady said such measures could 
weaken international institutions and prompt political opposition 
in creditor countries 
the japanese proposal outlined by satoshi sumita governor of 
the bank of japan first was made at the toronto summit of 
industrialized nations 
it calls for some latin debt to be converted into bonds and 
payment terms on the rest of the loans to be lengthened under 
appropriate conditions to back up the billions of dollars in 
loans the debtor countries could set up special reserve accounts 
to be held in trust by the imf sumita said in outlining the 
proposal 
sumita said the countries also would have to agree to make 
imfbacked changes in their policies to foster economic growth 
it does not entail any transfer of risk from the commercial 
banks to the multilateral financial institutions or creditor 
governments sumita said 
french finance minister pierre beregovoy praised the japanese 
initiative 
efforts by countries with large surpluses are a good way to 
augment growth he said 
beregovoy also opposed shifting to governments the risky loans 
made by banks 
mexican treasury secretary gustavo petricioli speaking on 
behalf of latin american nations urged rich countries with extra 
money to set up funds that constitute an additional source of 
financing to the debtor countries in order to support their growth 
or carry out debtreduction operations 
speaking on behalf of latin american nations perticiolo called 
for an international development pact to help the heavily indebted 
developing countries 
as part of the pact he said that debtor countries should follow 
economic policies that emphasize growth that international 
agencies and banks should channel more money to the debtors and 
that the industrial nations should spread out payment terms on the 
debtors loans 
the atmosphere in berlin has been marked by widespread

british publisher robert maxwell miffed that 
macmillan inc entered into a 25 billion buyout agreement without 
telling him is reviewing his options for continuing his pursuit of 
the publishing giant 
on tuesday macmillan accepted a cashandsecurities buyout 
offer valued at 9005 a share from the investment firm kohlberg 
kravis roberts amp co 
the agreement also gave kohlberg an option to buy four of 
macmillans businesses under limited circumstances which were 
not spelled out in the announcement macmillan said details would 
be filed with the securities and exchange commission 
macmillan had set a monday afternoon deadline for submission of 
final buout offer that evening maxwell said tuesday he told 
macmillan he was increasing his offer to 89 a share in cash the 
offer apparently fell short as did maxwells outstanding tender 
offer of 8680 a share 
macmillan stock jumped 150 a share to close at 8862 tuesday 
on the new york stock exchange 
a spokesman in new york for maxwell communication corp said it 
was evaluating the kohlberg offer but would not comment on whether 
maxwell planned to raise his 89 a share bid 
maxwell said he had asked the macmillan board to inform him if 
it received a higher bid so that he could have an opportunity to 
quickly top it 
i am shocked that they would enter into this hasty 
illconceived junkbond financed offer with kkr without even 
contacting me he said in a statement 
macmillan rebutted that maxwell was given every opportunity to 
amend his bid 
earlier this month macmillan agreed to a kohlbergled buyout 
and then backed out when maxwell bettered the price 
but analysts speculated kohlbergs latest bid would end the 
auction even the most optimistic observers said the company was 
worth little more than 90 a share 
its a bidding war and it has become more than just an 
economic question at these prices said robert dunlap jr an 
analyst at brown brothers harriman amp co the issue has become who 
can eke out the highest bid 
part of maxwells motivation in pursuing macmillan lies in his 
personal commitment to create one of the worlds largest 
communications concerns he already owns major us printing 
operations and extensive media holdings in britain 
while maxwell likely could afford to top kohlbergs bid he 
said he was willing to pay a fair price but not a stupid price 
for the company said bert boksen an analyst at raymond james amp 
associates in st petersburg fla 
analysts said kohlberg kravis probably would break macmillan 
apart and put most of its emphasis on the companys information 
services 
the unit which accounted for 40 percent or 62 million of 
macmillans operating profit in 1987 has grown rapidly in recent 
years dunlap expects the unit which publishes directories 
including whos who and trade magazines can continue to grow at a 
25 percent annual rate 
if all 278 million macmillans shares were tendered 
shareholders would receive 8205 in cash 3 in notes and warrants 
valued at 5 for each share they hold the proportion of cash would 
change if fewer than the companys 278 million shares were 
tendered 
maxwell said he believed members of the financial community 
have valued the kohlberg bid at less than 89 a share 
the macmillan board approved kohlbergs initial 85ashare 
proposal in midseptember but withdrew its backing last week after 
maxwell raised his offer to 8680 a share from 80 
macmillan has been embroiled in a takeover contest since may 
when a group led by wealthy texan robert n bass proposed a buyout 
at 64 a share 
the bass group since has dropped out of the bidding with its 
last offer at 75 a share 
in an attempt to head off a takeover attempt macmillan proposed 
a financial restructuring it valued at about 6415 a share but 
the bass group challenged the plan in court and won an order 
blocking it 
the restructuring would have split macmillan into two companies 
publishing and information services and paid a special cash 
dividend to shareholders 
in addition to its book publishing and information services 
operations macmillan owns the katherine gibbs secretarial and 
berlitz language schools

the cost of all the lost time and unproductive time is a real 
loss to the industry said association president emilymay 
richards founder of the richards group an atlanta accounting

one preschool child at 7000 
its not going to be enough to win those people with just 
salaries and job change emerson said there needs to be

all areas for financing it 
emerson said the association is forming a task force to study 
and develop methods of publicprivate child care financing as well 
as lobby for child care legislation

the business ross perot has lined up for his new 
company violates a nocompetition agreement he made when he left 
his old company electronic data systems according to a suit filed 
by eds 
the suit filed tuesday in a fairfax va circuit court seeks an 
order enforcing a dec 1 1986 agreement in which perot said he 
would not compete with eds for three years said eds spokesman bill 
wright 
the same agreement precludes perot from operating a forprofit 
company until december 1989 
we are asking the court to ask perot to honor this contract 
wright said 
perot founded eds a giant computer services firm in 1962 and 
sold it to general motors corp in 1984 in december 1986 after a 
highly publicized conflict between perot and gm perot and three 
other top eds executives left the the company when gm agreed to pay 
them about 850 million 
the purpose of the nocompetition agreement was to prevent perot 
from using proprietary and strategic information about eds 
markets and services to compete with the company wright said 
perot with his public statements and marketing activities is 
showing that he has no intentions of honoring that agreement the 
suit claims 
the alleged violations include perots proposal earlier this 
year to automate the us postal service after protests by eds and 
other companies the general services administration suspended 
perots postal contract 
although he had not seen the suit perot said it really looks 
silly 
all they do is spend a lot of money on legal work he said 
in june perot founded perot systems corp and the company 
obtained a controversial nobid contract to automate the postal 
service perot has challenged the gsas suspension of the contract 
the postal service contract is just one of perots activities 
that eds claims violate the 1986 agreement 
wright declined to give other examples of how perot and his new 
company may have broken the agreement but said we dont think 
it will be hard to prove 
suffice to say its violations across a broad range of 
markets eds serves wright said 
in july perot bid on a medicaid contract which expires in 
1989 eds won the lucrative medicaid contract in 1976 helping the 
company establish its reputation nationwide

the nva in addition to representing the approximately 1300 
wineries in this country also is targeting for membership 
thousands more winegrape growers at the start of the production 
chain according to association executive director richard feeney 
the nva is a national trade association based on capitol 
hillbecause the wine industry faces serious threats from federal 
regulation because nva members need to have timely accurate 
information from washington feeney said 
feeney a congressional lobbyist and onetime director of the 
national meat association said his direct connection with wine was 
from 197074 when he was partner in a wine importing business 
feeney said the association only a few weeks old had no 
intention of vying for supremacy with californias 54yearold wine 
institute which directly represents for 520 of the states 770 
wineries 
most other wineproducing states have no organization said 
feeney contending the fact remains that if a vintner in 
virginia or oregon wants to join a national organization there 
aint any 
feeney said he did not think many other wineproducing states 
had adequate liaison with congress and federal agencies affecting 
the industry 
vintners are worried about what they see as a wave of 
prohibitionist feeling in america expressed in new label laws 
restaurant posting of toxicity warnings for pregnant women new 
taxes and a widespread antialcohol surge 
one of the nvas most ambitious programs will be to lobby 
congress to change the way federal law regards winegrapes said 
feeney who said lawmakers might be ready to look at wine 
differently 
unlike many other agricultural products grapes grown for wine 
get no subsidy and the end product is regarded an alcoholic 
beverage subject to regulation by the bureau of alcohol tobacco 
and firearms 
feeney said the time has come for wine to take its place with 
other agricultural products and to share benefits enjoyed by 
commodities such as soybeans beef dairy products catfish and 
pork 
he said he wants wine looked upon as food a desire that 
coincides with ongoing efforts of californias major vintners 
principally robert mondavi who is about to launch a privately 
financed prowine program

the united states uranium industry is 
critically ailing but the possibility for some recovery exists 
according to one uranium company official 
im convinced that the us industry is nonviable james w 
sanguinetti director of uranium marketing for freeport uranium 
co said tuesday in addressing a national industry seminar during 
a threeday meeting the fact that annual production has declined 
over 70 percent since 1980 and that exploration dollars have 
declined over 90 percent is indicative of an ailing if not dying 
industry 
howard l walton of the energy departments energy information 
administration said production of uranium the fuel source for 
nuclear energy totaled about 13 million pounds last year with 
about 85 million coming from conventional mining methods similar 
output is expected this year compared with peak production of 437 
million pounds in 1980 he said 
canada the worlds largest producer totaled 324 million 
pounds in 1987 
walton also noted that in 1987 
industry employment was at its lowest level since the 
government began keeping statistics 
surface drilling footage for uranium development and 
exploration was 196 million feet down 5 percent from 1986 and 
only 4 percent of the peak recorded for 1978 
aggregate industry assets were down by more than 55 percent 
between 1982 and 1987 from 36 billion to 16 billion as firms 
got out of the uranium business or wrote down assets 
walton said arizona texas and wyoming accounted for 77 percent 
of the total surface drilling in 1987 22 percent 25 percent and 
30 percent respectively 
sanguinetti said about 90 percent of the uranium consumed in the 
united states was bought under longterm contracts with prices 
roughly ranging from 30 to 35 a pound the remainder is bought on 
the spot market with current prices of about 14 a pound he said 
but sanguinetti said inventories are diminishing too we are 
getting close to balance but we havent reached it yet he said 
sanguinetti said he thinks the market price has bottomed and 
will show some improvement as the impending demand is felt 
utility managers are under tremendous pressure to reduce 
operating and maintenance costs and to take advantage of fuel 
prices in the depressed spot market he said but continuation of 
such policies will expose the utilities to volatile pricing that 
will be inevitable as supplies and inventories decline he said 
sanguinetti also said that as the number of operational nuclear 
plants increases along with their efficiency demand for uranium 
will increase 
he predicted a potential for producing about 20 million pounds a 
year if prices reach about 20 a pound and about 32 million pounds 
or 80 percent of americas demand at 30 a pound 
the higher the price the more viable producers there are 
sanguinetti said in the united states because of the abundance 
of reserves viability is a function of price at some point the 
whole industry will be declared viable again because of its ability 
to supply a significant quantity of uranium

buyers of new chrysler corp cars and trucks in 
washington dc can get a full refund within 30 days of purchase 
and denver buyers can trade in a car they dont like under 
experimental marketing programs 
both promotions run until nov 20 and will be pumped by chrysler 
chairman lee iacocca in television spots and newspaper 
advertisements the company announced tuesday 
they are extensions of the companys heavilyhyped car buyers 
bill of rights touted in twopage newspaper ads by iacocca 
earlier this month 
dealers in the two cities say they dont know what to expect 
but an industry analyst says she thinks similar promotions will 
follow from other us car makers as traditional cash rebates and 
percentage rate deals continue to fade 
the initial impact is not as influential as a rebate said 
cynthia certo an analyst at integrated automotive resources in 
wayne pa it is a very good imagebuilding tactic 
what the automakers are saying is they have improved quality 
and theyre going to back it up theyre saying heres the 
guarantee the europeans have been doing things like this for the 
last year and a half 
chrysler spokesman tom jakobowski said the company hasnt 
decided whether to extend the promotion as it did in 1982 when the 
company was recovering from its nearfailure 
we went back and looked at what we had done before and decided 
this program had some merits he said at this point its 
strictly a test program 
fewer than 1 percent of cars sold during the nationwide 
promotion six years ago were returned jakobowski said 
in denver chrysler is allowing customers to bring back a 
chrysler product for exchange anytime within 30 days after purchase 
for exchange on another chrysler product the buyer can trade up or 
down and pay or be refunded the difference according to the 
original contract excluding any incentives financing and 
insurance costs incurred on the first car 
the area advertising on this starts today said alex 
jannicelli retail sales manager at colorado chrysler plymouth in 
denver its a brand new thing we dont know how it will go 
over talk to me in a week 
reaction in the washington metropolitan area also has been slow 
i guess not that many people know about it said rick warn 
sales manager of rosenthal dodge in northern virginia his 
dealership is one of 47 participating in the money back promotion 
general motors corps pontiac division sponsored a promotion 
offering exchanges within 30 days or 3000 miles to california 
buyers of the grand am in the summer months fewer than 05 percent 
returned them for different pontiacs spokeswoman sheila main said 
certainly were evaluating the program for possible 
expansion she said 
ford motor co spokesman dave krupp said the no 2 automaker has 
no plans for similar offerings 
this is an incentive program we have incentives in place that 
were happy with that are proven we plan to stay with them

time inc and warner communications inc 
executives reportedly came close to a 10 billion merger last month 
but the deal fell through according to an unnamed source quoted in 
wednesdays editions of the new york times 
the newspaper said the source who it described as an industry 
expert familiar with the talks said a major reason the merger 
talks broke down was the difficulty of reaching agreement on how to 
manage the combined operations of the two media companies 
the deal aimed at making their companies so big that they would 
be almost invulnerable to a takeover reportedly was discussed in 
detail by j richard munro chairman of time steven j ross 
chairman of warner nj nicholas jr times president and gerald 
m levin time vice chairman according to the industry expert 
the proposed merger never was put to the boards of directors of 
each company because times board might have rejected it the 
industry expert said 
spokespeople for time and warner each declined to comment to the 
times on the report 
times stock soared by more than 19 a share last week on the 
new york stock exchange amid unconfirmed rumors that the media and 
entertainment giant was contemplating a buyout or restructuring 
but then fell 1025 on lack of any development 
after the stock jumped 962 a share to 11625 on sept 19 
time issued a statement saying it knew of no reason for the rise in 
its stock price 
while it is time incs policy not to comment on market 
rumors in view of the uninformed speculation about the company in 
the last two trading days time inc said today that it is not 
considering a leveraged buyout or any other transaction that could 
account for the rise in its stock price 
time closed wednesday at 10625 a share down 12 cents based 
on its roughly 58 million common shares outstanding the company 
has a stock market value of about 616 billion 
warner closed at 3550 a share up 37 cents in new york stock 
exchange trading giving it a market value of about 447 nillion 
based on its 126 million outstanding shares 
the industry expert quoted by the times indicated the merger 
talks began two months ago to consideration a combination of just 
the companies cable television operations but later expanded 
time is a leading magazine and book publisher owns the home box 
office paytelevision service and has an 82 percent stake in 
american television and communications corp a cable television 
operator with about 378 million subscribers 
warner owns warner cable the natons sixthlargest system with 
about 14 million subscribers as well as the warner bros film 
studio 
the combined timewarner operations would employ 30000 people 
and have annual sales of more than 8 billion making it one of the 
biggest entertainment industry companies

sources at international coffee organization talks 
said a us proposal tuesday on regulating supplies and prices 
would tend to benefit latin american producers at the expense of 
most african countries 
they said the effect of the us proposals for the coming year 
would be to transfer export market share from producers of the 
cheaper robusta grade to those selling the soughtafter arabica 
type 
the sources at the london talks spoke on condition of anonymity 
the bulk of robusta production about 25 percent of all world 
coffee grown from africa principally the ivory coast uganda 
cameroon zaire and madagascar the biggest producer outside the 
region is indonesia 
arabicas are grown throughout latin america with brazil and 
colombia the biggest producers kenya ethiopia tanzania and india 
are the only significant nonlatin american producers 
under the us proposal on the shape of the icos market control 
plan for the year beginning oct 1 producers would be exempt from 
reductions in export quota if the price of their type of coffee 
exceeded 125 a pound 
the average price of arabicas is just over 130 on world 
markets and robustas averaged slightly more than 90 cents 
the us plan calls for an initial 198889 global export quota 
of 58 million bags which would be cut by 15 million bags if the 
ico indicator of the average price of robustas and arabicas was 
115 or below any time during the year one bag equals 60 kilos 
or 132 pounds 
a further cut of 15 million bags would take place not less than 
10 days after the first if the indicator remained below 115 a 
pound 
the indicator currently just above 113 is likely to be 
below 115 on oct 1 thereby triggering an immediate reduction in 
the 198889 global quota industry sources said 
current prices levels are telling us that the brunt of that 
cut would be borne by robustas if the united states has its way 
said a trader 
the price of this grade was certain to be below 125 and that 
of arabicas just as certain to be above he said 
robusta producers would also risk losing out under the us 
proposal if any quota increases took place in 198889 the sources 
said 
earlier tuesday officials of brazil and colombia the worlds 
two biggest coffee producers said they were ready to open 
negotiations with consumers on a pricesupport regime following 
agreement on a joint position 
the braziliancolombian proposal calls for an initial global 
export quota of 54 million bags for 198889 the aim would be to 
defend an unchanged price range in the area of 120 to 140 a 
pound 
the 198788 ico export quota stands at 515 million bags 
according to a copy of the braziliancolombian proposal the 
198889 global quota would be increased at fixed trigger prices to 
reach 58 million bags balance between supply and demand at 
130 a pound 
it would let producers of arabica coffee have a greater share of 
any quota increase than those growing the cheaper robusta grade 
all proposals presented tuesday will be considered by a special 
contact group of key ico countries set up to try to negotiate a 
pricesupport deal for 198889 by the scheduled end of the talks on 
sept 30 
the united states the european economic community and other ico 
consumers want to increase supplies of mild arabicas in 198889 
because of growing demand for this grade and the record premium its 
price has established over robustas

the finance minister for botswana said wednesday 
that the third world should have more say in designing 
debtreduction programs 
ps mmusi a spokesman for african nations also questioned 
whether the united states and other industrialized countries 
actually used the casebycase approach to third world debt 
although a casebycase approach is allegedly used in the 
design of programs it is common knowledge that much of the work is 
done in washington and that different country programs show a very 
close similarity mmusi said at the annual meeting of the 
international monetary fund and world bank 
both institutions devote much of their efforts to helping debtor 
countries out of financial trouble the world bank also finances 
projects to help them raise their living standards 
mmusi said debtor governments should become more active in 
designing the programs which are the condition for aid from the 
world bank and imf 
third world leaders often complain that debtreduction programs 
are too austere requiring for example the elimination of food 
subsidies rather than a casebycase approach many debtor 
governments would like to see a general reduction of their debts 
and the interest they pay on them

smithkline beckman corp says a major 
restructuring of its pharmaceutical business could save the company 
100 million a year by the end of 1990 
smithkline which makes animal health care products and 
pharmaceuticals such as contac cold medicine announced tuesday it 
was laying off about 1600 workers as part of the reorganization to 
reverse declining sales 
under the restructuring the companys us and international 
drug sales and research will be consolidated and headed by john f 
chappell who has been head of the international business since 
1985 smithkline said 
to create jobs in the future we need to be a lean lowcost 
company today henry wendt smithklines chief executive officer 
said 
wendt said the restructing could result in annual savings for 
the company of around 100 million in the next two years 
he said about half of the job losses stem from the closing of 
the companys 40yearold pharmaceutical manufacturing plant in 
philadelphia smithkline employs more than 40000 workers in the 
united states and overseas 
smithkline recently announced a 25 percent drop in 
secondquarter profits the realignment will result in a 
thirdquarter charge of between 375 million and 400 million 
against pretax earnings 
nevertheless the company said it expects 1988 earnings to be 
375 to 4 a share up from a 5 percent to 10 percent anticipated 
drop in 1987s 450ashare profit the company said 
on the new york stock exchange smithkline stock closed at 
4612 tuesday down 2 a share 
if the changes are successful in handling pharmaceutical 
business more efficiently than in the past the moves will be 
successful said richard stover an analyst with alex brown amp sons 
brokers in new york they have been slow in making decisions and 
slow in commercializing products 
the company said in july it would reorganize its business 
following a lackluster firsthalf performance the company also 
predicted that earnings for the full 1988 fiscal year would be down 
by 25 percent in addition to the secondquarter decline 
our purpose remains unchanged wendt said we are a 
technologydriven company pursuing worldwide leadership positions 
in fastgrowing segments of the health care and life sciences 
markets 
we are positioning smith kline amp french laboratories our 
pharmaceutical business to receive more focused leadership and 
attention under a single organization designed to more rapidly 
commercialize current products and develop and market future 
products on a worldwide scale he said 
smithkline earlier had blamed some of its problems on the 
disappointing sales of its two top drugs tagamet an antiulcer 
drug and dyazide a drug used in the treatment of hypertension 
but wendt said at a news conference that tagamets recent 
disappointing performance was not the cause of the shakeup 
if there were strong tagamet sales and less competition we 
would still be here today talking about these decisions he said 
with the cost of developing and introducing a new drug at about 
125 million the company needs to market new products worldwide 
and consolidate research and marketing he said 
the company also said it plans to issue 5 million new shares of 
beckman instruments a subsidiary of smithkline beckman

few americans will ever forget the crash of oct 
19 1987 a day in which a halftrillion dollars in paper wealth 
disappeared when newspapers wore black headlines when 
newscasters voices betrayed fear 
people felt in the midst of history of being victims of events 
not understood it conjured gray images of bankruptcies 
breadlines unemployed mortgages foreclosed impending depression 
it was 1929 again 
those were the first impressions but they may not be the ones 
that endure because the worst did not happen the lasting memory 
may be a delightful sense of relief 
within a few weeks fear had lost its cutting edge although 
anxiety still gnawed at confidence that feeling too began to fade 
before the end of the year evolving into a mere wariness that 
economists termed healthy 
in the newer atmosphere consumers were less inclined to take on 
debt investors seemed motivated by sensible yields rather than 
instant wealth and business resolved to remain lean and 
competitive 
moreover there ensued a renewed effort by global powers to 
synchronize economic policies which heretofore had often been at 
odds promises were made to stabilize the dollar to coordinate 
interest rates and open up trade 
all in all americans surprised themselves despite frightening 
comparisons with 1929 forecasts of a further debacle in 
securities and expectations of recession by esteemed academics and 
others panic never gripped the country 
part of the reason for that was good fortune part can be 
attributed to good crisis management 
on the side of good fortune was the health of the economy which 
was growing strongly at the time of the crash with a resilience 
born of five years of expansion on the management front quick 
action by the federal reserve to open credit lines in the wake of 
the crash was key to restoring calm and liquidity 
and because most americans were not direct owners of stocks in 
the first place they were able to avoid the brunt of the crashs 
punishment 
the memories that remain therefore are those of a near miss a 
lesson learned a feeling of gratitude a determination to fix up 
the things that were wrong such as the budget and trade deficits 
it was some said a shot across the bow a warning that helped 
the world avert a disaster before the end of the year the great 
stock market collapse was even being hailed as a savior it averted 
a worse disaster some said 
in fact as the year ended fortune magazine editors asked 
who would have predicted it on oct 20th the crash has not only 
failed to make a recession more likely before mid1988 it has made 
one less likely 
when the crash occurred a feeling existed that the economy was 
overheating and headed for inflation and higher interest rates to 
be followed by a deep recession the crash slowed things 
incredibly it took the pressure off 
very little evidence of the great crash has showed up in the 
economic statistics since then confidence has remained high 
business continues to spend for capital improvements economic 
indicators show expansion continuing 
but there were effects important ones with potentially 
farreaching consequences 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
the collapse routed the madness that had pushed prices beyond 
reason a year ago stock prices got so high in relation to 
earnings per share that an investor would have been foolish not to 
buy bonds instead the crash in effect put stocks on sale by 
slashing prices 
a year after the collapse stock prices were about 12 times one 
years earnings a decline of 40 percent 
the market was healthier no question trading activity had 
quieted impossible expectations had diminished the touts and 
hucksters were being scorned people no longer believed prices 
could soar to the heavens

regulatory officials both in government and the industry seem 
more aware of the dangers inherent in the mechanics of the 
marketplace that is in the ability of markets brokers and 
technology to handle heavy volume 
various study committees have pointed to dangers in the 
activities of program traders arbitragers insiders and other 
active shortterm participants with sufficient financial clout to 
accelerate price changes 
critics continue to say however that there has been more study 
than action more talk about new rules than changes in the rules 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
the securities collapse was global not only are marketplaces 
interlinked electronically but economies are interdependent as a 
consequence monetary fiscal and trade policies of trading nations 
impact each other infinitely 
while international cooperation since the crash has been 
volatile at times with arguments raging about trade restrictions 
interest rate levels credit conditions fiscal policies and the 
like there has been some improvement 
the dollar has stabilized for the time being at least american 
goods seem more competitive abroad helping to correct the us 
payments imbalance and creating a healthier trade relationship 
among nations 
central banks throughout the world are now intensely aware that 
they must coordinate economic policies since it is known that the 
slightest problems left untended can cause financial aberrations 
detrimental to all 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
perhaps the biggest impact is still beyond easy statistical 
measurement it is a renewed sense of realism about expectations a 
vigilance about economic management a recognition that a stable 
economy requires restraints 
without a doubt most americans are less cocky about continued 
economic expansion but it is difficult to prove while almost 
certainly they are more riskconscious almost every survey shows 
them optimistic 
while hardly a day goes by without people being reminded that 
another shoe could fall somewhere in the economy that there is a 
crash impact yet to be felt the chief worries today relate to the 
basic economic cycle 
now completing its sixth year the economic expansion would seem 
to be in old age for that reason alone forecasters find it 
convenient to consider recession a possibility but they are 
forever postponing it 
the stock market itself gives little indication but it is still 
watched for clues true a feeling exists that the big crash of 
1987 seems to have been confined primarily within the securities 
industry itself 
but economy watchers realize that no sector of domestic activity 
is isolated from the rest any more than american european or 
asian economies are immune from each others specific problems 
stock markets still are viewed as longterm economic indicators 
and in spite of the mysteries it hides none remains more 
scrutinized for clues than the american marketplace

it was sunny and mild in downtown manhattan the 
morning of monday oct 19 1987 but black storm clouds had 
gathered inside the balconied trading room of the new york stock 
exchange 
at 930 am the opening bell clanged and the storm broke 
in the next 6 hours a halftrillion dollars of stock wealth 
disappeared and the dow jones average of 30 industrial stocks lost 
a recordshattering 508 points 
stock prices had fallen fitfully since late august when the dow 
jones average peaked at 272242 
the friday before black monday the average posted its first 
tripledigit decline 108 points culminating the biggest weekly 
decline since world war ii 
over the weekend investors asked themselves whether the 
fiveyear bull market had ended interest rates were climbing the 
trade deficit seemed intractable and us officials were wrestling 
with west germans over economic policy 
before trading opened stocks fell sharply in tokyo and london 
and a huge reservoir of sell orders piled up awaiting execution in 
new york the dollar plunged and gold soared to its highest level 
in almost five years 
adding to the pessimism a bulletin said the united states had 
destroyed an iranian oil platform in the persian gulf 
prices on the nyse plunged from the opening bell the dow jones 
average fell about 69 points by 10 am and an unprecedented 201 
points by 11 am 
then there was a bounce a breath of hope for the market by 
noon the average was down just 128 but then the selling resumed 
with just two modest rallies around 1 pm and 230 pm 
the most blindly relentless sellers were portfolio insurers 
whose strategy called for them to sell clients stocks or 
stockindex futures whenever the market went down 
the volume of more than 600 million shares overwhelmed the 
computerized trading system and damaged a crucial link between the 
nyse and the futures markets in chicago 
small investors were last in line to sell some brokers took 
their phones off the hook 
rumors spread shortly after 1 pm that the nyse would be 
closed and a rapid denial by the securities and exchange 
commission failed to convince nervous traders 
the bond market had fallen most of the day but began a powerful 
rally in late afternoon traders decided the crash signaled a 
recession or worse which would be good for bond prices 
shortly before 3 pm the dow jones average had lost roughly 250 
points from then on stocks went into a sickening free fall that 
was terminated only by the closing bell at 4 pm 
at 545 pm federal reserve chairman alan greenspan stepped 
off a plane in dallas and asked someone how the market closed 
down fiveoheight the official said 
for a moment greenspan was relieved thinking the person meant 
508 points instead of 508 for greenspan as for the rest of the 
world black monday took a moment to sink in

some 12000 to 17000 people in the securities industry 75 
percent to 10 percent of the work force lost their jobs as a 
result of the oct 19 crash according to some estimates few have 
found new jobs within the industry and some experts predict that 
the number of unemployed could double before the situation 
stabilizes 
were going to see more layoffs coming said perrin long an 
analyst for lipper analytical securities corp 
another 4000 to 5000 wall streeters could lose their jobs by 
the end of the year he estimates they would swell the legions of 
crash victims stockbrokers financial analysts floor traders 
secretaries and backoffice clerks and computer operators who 
process orders for stocks and bonds 
much of the impetus for new job cuts could come from the big 
brokerage companies earnings reports for the third quarter which 
are widely expected to be even worse than in the previous 
threemonth period 
they wont be good said donald mclellan an analyst for 
fitch investors service inc referring to the thirdquarter 
reports the longer this goes on the more layoffs there will 
be 
in the second quarter results already were mixed the overall 
profit of new york stock exchange member firms doing business with 
the public increased more than 25 percent from a year earlier but 
160 of the 386 companies lost money the exchange said in a recent 
report 
between september 1987 and august of this year 9186 former 
employees of brokerage firms applied for new york state 
unemployment benefits up sharply from 3500 applicants in the same 
period a year earlier according to the states department of labor 
in albany 
the maximum unemployment benefit in the state is 180 a week 
one of the lowest in the country payable for up to six months 
those who lost jobs came from three broad categories of wall 
street workers clerical and secretarial paying less than 40000 
a year brokers and midlevel management paying 40000 to 
100000 and toplevel executives pulling in over 100000 
what were seeing is an ongoing restructuring on wall 
street said samuel ehrenhalt regional commissioner in new york 
of the us bureau of labor statistics i dont think weve seen 
the end of the process 
mari terzaghi a clinical psychologist who specializes in 
patients from the financial community says she still treats many 
people suffering from what she calls the identity crash 
triggered by black monday when people develop a sense of 
themselves in money symbols then lose them because of investments 
or jobs they feel a sense of annihilation she explains 
the situation really has not gotten better ms terzaghi 
said noting that wall street types continue to come to her because 
theyre unable to reestablish a sense of control a sense of 
their selfidentity 
at least one patient developed heart problems largely because of 
postcrash stress she said 
some of the big brokerage houses are trying to put a good face 
on things and if theyre planning more layoffs theyre not saying 
merrill lynch amp co inc which cut around 4000 people or 85 
percent of its work force in the wake of the crash has recently 
started to expand in some areas spokesman fred yager said 
the expansion has been accomplished mainly through internal 
transfers rather than by hiring new employees he explained 
we have a very upbeat attitude right now yager said its 
become less of a crapshoot and more oldfashioned business sense 
merrill lynch is marking the anniversary of the stock debacle 
with a series of investment seminars around the country on oct 17 
the first big victim of the crash was ef hutton group inc 
which was absorbed in a merger last december by another wall street 
giant shearson lehman brothers inc some 5000 to 6000 hutton 
employees were squeezed out by the combination 
since then theres been a certain amount of caution or 
conservatism in terms of adding people shearson spokesman 
michael oneill said 
like the other brokerages shearsons retail business has 
suffered but oneill noted growth in other areas like merchant 
banking mergers and acquisitions and european operations 
drexel burnham lambert inc laid off 150 to 200 of its 11000 
employees kidder peabody amp cos firing of around 1000 or 13 
percent of its staff was partly due to a corporate reorganization 
that preceded the crash the firm says 
some brokerage houses are touchy about the layoff issue and 
refuse to discuss specifics 
were not doing head counts said peter costiglio a 
spokesman for prudentialbache securities inc 
some displaced wall streeters seem to be finding new jobs in the 
industry but not enough to make a real dent 
raymond james amp associates a mediumsized brokerage firm in st 
petersburg fla was swamped with job applications from 
shellshocked wall street denizens after black monday 
now though the trickledown theory is over with said 
lawrence silver vice president of marketing services for the firm 
others are turning to different industries finding jobs in 
manufacturing companies service industries and insurance companies 
usually as salesman in the latter attorneys accountants and 
financial analysts seem most able to transfer their skills to new 
jobs while brokers are having the hardest time of it 
theyre having trouble said gregory ferrara a managing 
partner of forum personnel incs lower manhattan office

down from 6774 in august 1987 the number of candidates normally 
increases from year to year the nasd says 
the sixhour exam is tough the failure rate is around 40 
percent to 50 percent there are no educational requirements just 
a 50 fee 
its given on the third saturday of every month at 36 locations 
around the country and less frequently in five foreign cities 
successful candidates get their fingerprints taken and sent to 
the fbi 
there were about 470000 nasdregistered brokers as of june 30 
of this year up from 450000 on june 30 1987 not all of the 
qualified brokers are actually practicing their craft however

computer consultant ernest harden still shakes 
his head in disbelief when he thinks about how an eleventh hour 
telephone call saved his 300000 investment portfolio 
hank his financial planner had tried to reach me two weeks 
before the stock market crash to get me to sell but i kept putting 
him off the jacksonville fla man recalled when i called 
him back i took his advice 
that was just a week before the oct 19 collapse 
while harden who had most of his portfolio in stocks was 
luckier than most investors his evolving investment strategy has 
taken a nearuniversal conservative turn lessrisky money market 
accounts and fixedincome products such as bonds or certificates 
of deposits are in these days while stocks considered too 
speculative are out 
there has been a change in appetite said marshall b front 
an economist at chicagobased stein roe amp farnham which manages 
about 11 billion in investment assets including pension funds and 
individual accounts theres much greater emphasis on capital 
preservation and less emphasis on capital enhancement 
it mirrors whats been going on in the stock market in general 
today the volume is down the level of interest seems to be quite 
modest 
after the crash many investors who had thought the 
onceroaring stock market invincible rushed to put their money 
into what they considered safe havens governmentbacked treasury 
bonds and notes cds less risky mutual funds or just plain savings 
accounts 
the amount of stock the average american family held in its 
investment portfolio declined to 201 percent in the fourth quarter 
of 1987 from 25 percent the previous quarter the peak of the bull 
market according to goldman sachs amp co 
net deposits in the nations federally insured savings 
institutions soared by 12 billion the last three months of last 
year government regulators found during those same months assets 
of money market mutual funds gained about 15 billion nationwide 
compared to a loss of about 60 billion in equity fund assets 
according to the washingtonbased investment company institute 
which tracks mutual funds 
all that money flowing out of stocks helped keep interest rates 
down at a time when some economists were forecasting a recession 
the lower rates made a lot of bondholders happy because the price 
of their debt securities rose as a result 
bonds were a very big beneficiary of the stock market crash 
noted jay goldinger who runs the beverly hills calif investment 
banking firm capital insight inc the vast majority of my money 
and my clients money was in bonds i didnt lose because of it 
those who did lose money are now diversifying more financial 
planners said while others are shopping for investments of another 
kind 
when given the decision between investing and consuming they 
clients say they would rather consume said michael stein a 
financial planner with brownson rehmus amp foxworth in chicago 
were seeing people upgrading their residences buying second 
homes or vacation homes 
theyre also spending money to furnish those new residences 
harden 45 who runs his own computer consulting business fits 
into that category he said after the crash he and his wife linda 
bought several singlefamily homes in the jacksonville fla area 
as an investment 
the most protection an investor can have is in real estate 
harden said i dont trust the stock market 
his financial planner hank madden of new yorkbased ids 
financial services inc said that the way some people 
indiscriminately poured money in the market before the crash 
contributed to its downfall by making some stocks rise too high 
too fast 
a lot of it goes back to the hamburger mentality of america 
gimme the sizzle fast madden said in times of prosperity 
people invested more on emotion than in logical planning 
since the crash many investors have decided to pay more 
attention to their investments financial advisers say that 
investors are pickier opting for stock of companies with solid 
earnings or those that can weather certain economic changes like 
rising inflation 
lenn width 69 a retired lumberyard owner who belongs to two 
investment clubs in the seattle area said he remains optimistic 
about the market even though the value of each clubs portfolio 
lost about 25 percent after the crash around the average drop for 
most investment clubs 
what it the crash really developed into was a much better 
buying opportunity width said adding that his clubs already 
have recovered at least half of their losses 
you pick up a newspaper and you see things advertised for 25 
percent and you run over and get it its the same way with the 
stock market

the stock market crash not only produced big losses but also 
took some of the fun out of investing for those who do it for a 
hobby 
interest in starting private investment clubs doityourself 
mutual funds that pool members money mainly to buy stocks has 
declined according to the national association of investors corp

more fledgling clubs also went under after the crash 
we ordinarily lose about 50 percent of the clubs in their 
first year after the crash we were losing about 70 percent 
ohara said 
the collapse in stock prices drained the value of clubs

the crash of 87 may be part of wall street 
lore but its already a fastfading memory for the moneymen who 
have kept corporate transactions moving 
mergers and acquisitions junkbond deals and new stock 
offerings snapped back with a vengeance in the first quarter of 
1988 as if making up for lost time and have marched at a heady 
pace ever since 
initial nervousness vanished rapidly as investors began to look 
upon decimated stock prices as wonderful bargains 
we essentially had a doubling up it was the logical deal flow 
from the previous quarter said les fabuss a senior vice 
president at shearson lehman hutton inc 
from january through late september more than 128 billion was 
spent to gain majority stakes in 2089 companies according to idd 
information services that compares with 1981 such deals for 
917 billion in the yearago period 
what has changed is that investment houses and brokerages have 
become increasingly dependent upon fees garnered from these deals 
its become very hard to make money out of sales and trading 
operations fabuss said as the volume of stocks changing hands 
in daily trading has eroded substantially 
despite the crash billiondollar mergers have been no strangers 
to the marketplace with campeau corps 66 billion takeover of 
federated department stores inc topping a lengthy list for the 
year 
in the junkbond sector the sale of 107 billion of the 
highyield highrisk bonds by duracell holdings corp in what 
was one of the largest speculative issues of 1988 went off in 
september without a hitch 
in addition experts say the junkbond market has attracted a 
greater number of players over the past year making the market 
less dependent upon the singular force of pioneer drexel burnham 
lambert inc which has been charged with fraud by the securities 
and exchange commission 
even the crumbling of revco ds incs leveraged buyout in 
july the first major junkbond buyout to sink into bankruptcy 
court failed to send shivers through the debt markets instead 
experts pointed to the deals poor execution sales and earnings 
projections were far too rosy and buyers failed to line up to 
purchase assets 
immediately after the crash junk bonds which are often used to 
finance corporate takeovers or restructuring plans plunged on 
average between 30 and 80 per 1000 face value but by february 
new junkbond issues again were being churned out to the tune of 
more than 1 billion a month 
in the equity markets the number of initial public offerings 
has been cut in half this year compared with 1987 but the dollar 
value remains quite high from january through august idd figures 
show companies raised 171 billion in the stock market compared 
with 194 billion in the yearago period 
size remains a handicap for some corporate dealmakers however 
though they typically are not represented statistically the number 
of young firms seeking to raise 20 million to 30 million in the 
equity markets has dropped more than 50 percent since october 1987 
estimated mark radtke a vice president at venture economics inc 
a consulting firm in wellseley mass 
in the crush to meet expenses entrepreneurs are knocking on the 
doors of venture capitalists and seeking corporate partners rather 
than relying on the public 
this sector has been hit pretty hard radtke said noting 
that only the top tier of companies are successfully going 
public 
indeed if the big guns have anything left to worry about its 
that they might miss another good fishing expedition if the market 
tanks again 
articulating a common wall street sentiment fabuss noted that 
everybodys very much aware that were there to be another crash 
it would create tremendous opportunity 
robert willard senior vice president and head of mergers and 
acquisitions at prudentialbache securities inc agreed noting 
that a certain callousness has been built up that another crash 
would be an opportunity rather than something to run from

oil prices could continue eroding through the 
years end as world economics encourage quota cheating by members 
of the organization of petroleum exporting countries some 
economists say 
on the new york mercantile exchange the november contract for 
west texas intermediate the benchmark us crude waffled in a 
16cent trading range early today shortly after 11 am edt the 
contract was down 8 cents to 1406 a 42gallon barrel the 
contract closed tuesday at 1414 a barrel after falling to 1385 
early in the day 
on sept 12 prices briefly touched 1375 the lowest since 
october 1986 
other contract months also closed lower on tuesday 
wholesale unleaded gasoline for october delivery advanced 034 
cent to close at 4559 cents a gallon while other contract months 
ended the day mixed october wholesale heating oil closed down 072 
cent at 3951 cents a gallon while other contract months also 
declined 
tuesdays price drop came amid strong disappointment with the 
outcome of the opec price committees twoday meeting which 
adjourned monday without any concrete plan for dealing with the 
world oil glut and weakening prices 
prices dropped early in the session amid continued negative 
sentiment about the price committee meeting analysts said prices 
continued deteriorating as reports circulated that us crude 
inventories were higher 
the market recovered most of its losses by the end of the day a 
turnaround that market analysts attributed primarily to technical 
factors 
some analysts said they expected slightly lower prices in the 
near term followed by a recovery if the opec committee meetings in 
october and november lead to a reduction in oil output 
but economists said tuesdays sharp drop in prices was part of a 
predictable pattern of gradually eroding prices they expected to 
continue through the end of the year and possibly beyond 
i dont think theres any doubt that economists are correct 
and were headed lower said james steel an analyst at refco 
inc market analysts are too immediate in their thinking 
economists base their predictions partly on the fundamental 
difference between production costs and selling price 
steve h hanke chief economist of friedberg commodity 
management inc in baltimore and professor of economics at johns 
hopkins university said the marginal cost of production ranges 
between 30 cents a barrel for iraq and 465 for nigeria 
the cost is much below current prices therefore everyone has 
an incentive to cheat and produce more hanke said this is 
aggravated by a situation where the biggest producer the saudis 
are running a huge fiscal deficit and other opec producers have 
severe needs also 
hanke said he did not expect the opec meetings to produce 
anything substantive for the long term any increase in prices will 
be only temporary he predicted with prices possibly plunging to 
10 a barrel over the next several months 
cyrus h tahmassebi chief economist at ashland oil inc said 
that while the opec meetings were a step in the right direction 
they were unlikely to produce any concrete solutions in the near 
term 
opecs problems are long term and they need to identify them 
as well as their objectives tahmassebi said maybe after four 
or five meetings they might come up with something credible that 
might work in the long run

a state judge has blocked warner communication 
incs 118 billion acquisition of lorimar telepictures corp 
ruling that the merger violates terms of a 1984 agreement between 
warner and its largest shareholder 
warner said today that it planned to appeal the decision 
the ruling handed down tuesday by new york supreme court judge 
walter schackman was a victory for chriscraft industries inc a 
broadcasting and manufacturing company that controls 23 percent of 
warners voting stock 
chriscraft claimed in a suit filed in july that since lorimar 
owned six television stations the acquisition violated a fouryear 
agreement prohibiting warner from owning any tv station so long as 
warner owned 25 percent or more of chriscrafts bhc inc 
broadcasting subsidiary 
warner acquired a 425 percent stake in bhc in exchange for 
chriscraft getting the 23 percent interest in warners voting 
stock 
in his 13page decision schackman said that as a matter of 
law the pending acquisition of lorimar by warner will be a breach 
of the shareholders agreement 
schackman said warner could not acquire any lorimar stock until 
the televison stations were sold or it reduced its stake in bhc 
since the chriscraft suit three lorimar television stations 
have been sold and warner reportedly is negotiating the sale of one 
of the remaining three

look again at that gun control vote in congress recently 
at issue was the brady amendment to the sweeping drug 
legislation which would have required a sevenday waiting period 
before the purchase of a handgun 
the amendments defeat was a shame but it wasnt a surprise

common cause reported that from 1983 until last july the 
national rifle association has pumped 1167908 in political 
action committee contributions into the coffers of those members of 
congress who voted against the amendment 
the vote on the measure was 228182 of the 194 house members 
who voted on the measure and had received no nra money 142 of them 
73 percent voted against the nras position 
the amendment had the support of every major law enforcement 
organization in the country these groups lost a battle 
money talks and in congress and state legislatures money 
votes the nra money bought the nra victory and the people stand

the capital times madison wis on high school football player 
injuries 
deerfield wis high school officials faced a tough decision 
this fall their football team only three seasons ago a contender 
for the state championship had fallen on hard times 
between decreasing enrollment and early season injuries to upper 
classmen the deerfield demons were fielding a team composed mostly 
of freshmen and sophomores that meant more than the potential of 
losing games it meant the potential of serious injuries to young 
players 
weve got 14 and 15yearolds going up against 17 and 
18yearolds coach pete christopherson said whats more 
important than a young persons health 
that is precisely the right question and why deerfield school 
officials were right to shorten their football season even though 
it means forfeiting three games they are putting the youngsters 
welfare first and for that they deserve a lot of credit

it grows so relentlessly that it leaves you 
little time to dwell on the impact it has on your way of life but 
that impact affects you from youth to retirement 
it is the credit society 
not long ago it was felt a student should graduate from college 
and enter the adult world brighteyed and raring to go now the 
student begins with a load of tuition loans to be repaid 
less than 20 years ago you felt sorry for the poor bloke who had 
to borrow money on the house a mortgage was there to be paid off 
and nothing provided more satisfaction than doing so borrow on the 
house what a pity 
a house today is considered a cash cow the equity to be tapped 
for what people consider essential expenditures thats the 
assumption but you wonder when you see your neighbor borrow for a 
trip to the caribbean 
you may recall that back in the 1960s it was customary to pay 
off the car loan in two or three years now you take up to seven 
years which means the car might have to be junked before the loan 
is retired 
perhaps you were one of those people who swore not to run up any 
more credit card or bank card debt since only 40 percent of the 
interest not 100 percent as before is deductible from your 
income tax have you kept your promise 
or as is likely have you been enticed into using your credit 
card by the promotional onslaught from the issuers its hard not 
to bite because the free offers come in the mail and over the 
phone often at dinnertime 
once you applied to the bank for credit but now the bank 
applies to you why not the rates they charge you on installment 
loans are better than rates they can get almost anywhere else even 
if the paperwork is onerous 
back in 1960 consumer credit amounted to about 65 billion by 
the end of 1987 it wad reached 753 billion 
that figure has been inflated of course by the declining value 
of the dollar but most of it is real growth in 1978 consumer 
installment debt as a portion of disposable personal income was 
under 155 percent and fell close to 14 percent in 1982 and 1983 
lately it has been in excess of 18 percent 
americans have a tradition of managing their credit 
intelligently but some observers wonder if borrowers will be able 
to handle the new flexible rates those that tend to rise at the 
wrong time that is when the economy in general is going the 
other way 
the credit union national association recently called attention 
to one of the newer problems in handling loans especially for 
automobiles 
imagine your surprise even shock when you learn your car is 
virtually worthless as a trade becuase you owe more on it than the 
dealer is willing to give you in trade 
the reason you probably chose longerterm financing for your 
automobile five six even seven years 
even more shocking are the costs involved in longerterm 
financing 
for example an 8000 loan at 14 percent interest for six years 
would require a monthly payment of about 165 but interest over 
the life of the loan would total almost 3870 only 40 percent of 
which is deductible 
credit is great as you read everyday in newspaper 
advertisements hear on radio and television and are informed by 
lenders who load up your mailbox with offers 
but it is also an expensive habit perhaps even an addiction 
some people are never able to shake it in a lifetime

government are not giving way easily 
powerful unions criticize the proposed sale of aerolineas 
argentinas and entel the phone company because employees might 
lose jobs or wages 
the opposition peronist party closely aligned with the unions 
complains about being left out of discussions in both deals and 
has erected obstacles to the sales in the congress 
i dont think either deal will be approved said peronist 
sen carlos tenev chairman of the committee of analysis and 
surveys that reviews the proposed sale of state companies 
the opposition portrays the sale of state property in terms of 
forfeiting the national patrimony but the party in power believes 
privatization is essential to putting the ailing economy back on 
track 
president raul alfonsin proposed the airline and phone company 
sales with an eye to reducing the bulging budget deficit and 
attracting foreign capital and technology plans also are being 
drawn up to sell shares in the state shipping line elma and divide 
the train company into cargo and longdistance passenger segments 
and offer them for sale 
the alfonsin government also has committed itself to sell its 
interests in seven petrochemical plants and is considering an 
offer by a us consortium to invest 800 million over five years 
to build and operate a natural gas processing plant 
a few years ago it was impossible to even talk about these 
things said horacio losoviz director of state companies i 
think the perception has developed that it is absolutely necessary 
to change direction due to the economic crisis 
argentina has major investments in several hundred companies 
and influences many others through import restrictions export 
tariffs foreign exchange regulations wage and price controls tax 
and investment laws 
the exploration and production of oil natural gas and coal is 
controlled by the state as is the distribution of water 
electricity and telephone lines the railroad is stateowned as are 
the main air and shipping lines and most every port 
the armed forces at their own factories make in addition to 
tanks and planes explosives for construction companies precision 
gear for automobiles farm equipment train cars industrial 
solvents tubes pipes and specialty steel products 
an estimated 2 million people work for the state of a total 
labor pool of about 12 million 
if lenin were to come here hed feel right at home said 
juan jose cresto an economics professor at the university of 
buenos aires everything is in the hands of the state 
it remains to be seen how much alfonsin can accomplish before 
national elections next may in which the ruling radical civic union 
faces an uphill struggle against the peronists other parts of 
alfonsins economic program have drawn fire for devaluing the 
national currency implementing voluntary wage and price controls 
and lifting some restrictions on imports 
the goal of the initiatives is to stem inflation running at an 
annual rate of more than 400 percent and secure new loans to cover 
the countrys 56 billion foreign debt 
but even critics of privatization concede that many things the 
state operates it does ineptly and at high cost 
argentines wait years to get their own telephones many people 
register their mail and pay higher postage in the hope it will 
arrive at its destination unopened within a reasonable time 
ferrocarriles argentinos the train company runs decadesold 
trains operated by unions that strike for reasons as minuscule as 
the lack of gloves for workmen to link the wagons 
aerolineas argentinas has more than 100 more employees per plane 
307 to 205 than does scandinavian airlines systems which has 
offered to buy 40 percent of the national carrier for 204 million 
public works minister rodolfo terragno estimates that the 13 
biggest state companies which ran a deficit of 29 billion last 
year waste 2 billion a year by paying inflated prices for goods 
and services 
for 40 years argentina has had an economic system 
characterized by the advance of the state over private 
activities said alvaro alsogaray a former economy minister and 
the presidential candidate of the centerright union of the 
democratic center that is the cause of backwardism here

president reagan as promised today vetoed 
legislation tightening curbs on textile apparel and shoe imports 
he said the bill would have disastrous effects on the us 
economy 
reagans action set the stage for a congressional override vote 
next week one prime backer estimated he was within eight votes of 
the twothirds majority needed to overrule the president 
white house spokesman marlin fitzwater said reagan vetoed the 
bill as soon as it arrived from capitol hill 
we vetoed it as soon as we got it fitzwater said 
the bill intended to protect american industries against 
foreign competition won final congressional approval last friday 
but without a twothirds margin 
reagan in a statement released by the white house charged that 
the measure would have disastrous effects on the us economy 
it would impose needles costs on american consumers threaten 
jobs in our export industries jeopardize our overseas farm sales 
and undermine our efforts to obtain a more open trading system for 
us exports president said 
this bill represents protectionism at its worst at a time 
when american exports are booming the united states must not 
embark on a course that would diminish our trade opportunities 
asked about possible repercussions of the veto on vice president 
george bushs election effort in the south where even some staunch 
republicans had backed the bill fitzwater replied its our 
belief that politics aside protectionism is the issue here 
but a chief senate sponsor of the bill ernest f hollings 
dsc issued a statement saying we gave president reagan 
exactly what he asked for 
seven years ago the european community globalized its quotas 
and president reagan recommended we globalize our quotas we did 
what the president wanted this is political demagoguery at its 
worst 
the bill would 
freeze textile and apparel imports at 1987 levels this year and 
limit growth to 1 percent annually starting in january 
freeze imports of nonrubber footwear with no provision for 
increases 
impose import quotas on 180 categories of textile products and 
30 types of footwear a system that would be reviewed after 10 
years 
set up a oneyear program under which the government would 
auctioned off import licenses and set a special quota for silk 
neckties 
rep butler derrick dsc said he hoped to vote on the veto 
tuesday we figure were about seven or eight votes off right now 
and we hope to wangle those by then he added 
i expected the veto derrick said reagan is misguided 
when it comes to his idea of protectionism he thinks theres such 
a thing as free trade and there is no such thing as free trade in 
the world 
fitzwater said he was confident the veto would not be overridden 
the house approved the bill on a vote of 248150 on friday 
earlier this month the senate approved the measure 5936

the textile and apparel industries along with a number of 
unions and their congressional allies had called the bill vital to 
halting job losses of more than 400000 in those industries 
hammered by a surge of foreignmade goods early in the decade 
worse they say those imports are still flooding american markets 
those claims are dismissed by critics who point to burgeoning 
earnings in the textile industry this year brought on by automation 
and greater efficiency in the plants 
the critics including retailers and businesses fearing new 
curbs would trigger retaliation against their exports say the 
increase in efficiency and automation were the result of the 
increased competition protectionism the critics argue would dull 
the american competitive response 
also today reagan signed legislation implementing the 
uscanadian free trade agreement saying it will mean lower 
prices for consumers and many new jobs for workers 
the action clears the way for the united states to phase out 
tariffs on 131 billion in merchandise that crosses the uscanada 
border each year leaders of the canadian senate however have 
said the chamber will delay action on the agreement until prime 
minister brian mulroney calls an election which could come in 
november

george bushs savings plan for low and 
middleincome people is likely to leave many of them scratching 
their heads and wondering if there was something left unsaid 
as described by bush it would seek to induce individuals into 
longterm savings plans with a reward many of them would consider 
niggardly in some instances it might amount to no reward at all 
under the proposal up to 1000 a year would accumulate 
taxfree if funds remained on deposit for at least five years when 
spent however interest income would be taxed at the regular tax 
rate 
this bush explained to voters would be helping themselves 
become better able to afford a home pay for college or start a 
business as well as increasing investment and economic growth 
a quick analysis of the numbers however suggests that few are 
likely to benefit a great deal unless they leave the money on 
deposit for a lifetime which rules out its use in education 
homeownership or entrepreneurship 
if for example a person deposited 1000 a year for five years 
at 10 percent interest a very generous and probably unobtainable 
rate it would seem their account would grow to about 6700 but 
it really wouldnt 
buying power is the only honest way to measure a dollar and 
inflation during those five years is likely to average something 
like 4 percent a year the net interest therefore would be 6 
percent rather than 10 percent 
that would make the fiveyear savings account worth just over 
6000 meaning a pretax gain of about 1000 however since the 
internal revenue service doesnt recognize inflation it will tax 
the apparent 1700 return 
the tax bite therefore will be either 15 percent or 28 percent 
of 1700 or roughly 475 reducing the accounts value to a net 
of just over 5500 for denying oneself the immediate use of 
money the return is about 100 a year 
more importantly a limit of 1000 a year at almost any 
realistic interest rates isnt going to help a whole lot in buying 
a house financing an education or creating seed money for a 
business enterprise 
the vice presidents team concedes that the benefits of his 
socalled individual savings account plan are small that 
concession might be especially pertinent in the housing area 
studies have shown repeatedly that the biggest impediment to 
home ownership among young couples and individuals is the down 
payment once over that hurdle many of them have the income to 
meet their monthly payments 
with this in mind housing and real estate people have advocated 
various plans under which savings placed and left untouched in 
special housing accounts should receive the same benefits as 
individual retirement accounts 
some in fact advocate that the existing ira mechanism rather 
than any new bureaucratic device be used money already in ira 
accounts therefore could be used for future retirement or present 
housing needs 
some go further while money removed from ira accounts by 
retirees is taxed at their prevailing tax rate money removed and 
invested in houses would not be taxed trust housing lobbyists to 
think of that one 
opposition to such ideas deals mainly with the cost critics say 
that a nation already scourged by deficit spending cannot afford to 
lose more revenue a general argument also exists that housing 
already has too many subsidies 
the counter argument is that americans deserve good housing and 
make better citizens when they own property moreover supporters 
contend what better way to hedge against inflation and prepare for 
retirement than to own a house 
if the vice president is seeking to encourage savings and thus 
keep the economy strong the housing supporters say why not really 
encourage home ownership 
they contend that no better forced savings plan has ever been 
devised than the house with a mortgage on it

finance leaders of industrial nations on wednesday 
questioned a japanese plan for easing the third world debt problem 
while poor countries renewed their appeals for more help 
nigel lawson the british chancellor of the exchequer told 
reporters at the annual meeting of the international monetary fund 
and world bank he found the japanese proposal a little bit 
elusive 
japans central bank governor satoshi sumita announced the 
plan tuesday as a way to help the big debtor countries like brazil 
and mexico which have a total debt of more than 220 billion 
under the plan some of the countries foreign debts would be 
converted into bonds interest on the bonds would be backed up by 
escrow accounts the debtors would set up with the imf and the 
bonds could then be sold to banks and other financial institutions 
sumita did not provide many details about the idea and some 
finance chiefs said they needed more information 
lawson said the plan would not be acceptable if it called for 
making public agencies rather than the banks bear the risk of 
nonpayment by debtor countries 
the question arises as to how the countries concerned are to 
acquire the collateral which they would place with the fund under 
the scheme he said german finance minister gerhard stoltenberg 
told reporters in essence every initiative should be welcomed 
but stoltenberg said he wanted to know more and questioned 
whether the imf should hold escrow accounts for the debtors 
we want to study that very carefully he said we want to 
see if there are other ways we have to assess whether the imf 
shouldor has to play that role 
the imf has been key in drawing up financial rescue packages for 
developing countres that cannot meet their debt payments its 
sister organization the world bank provides the countries with 
aid for economic development 
many of the finance officials from the 151 member nations of the 
organizations are attending the annual meeting which ends thursday 
the major industrial nations gave final approval over the 
weekend to a plan that would aid the poorest debtors mostly in 
subsaharan africa but the bigger debtors also would like special 
treatment 
the industrial nations have been following the baker plan for 
the debt problem that plan devised by former us treasury 
secretary james a baker iii calls in part for providing new loans 
to developing countries that enact economic liberalization policies 
but colombian finance minister luis fernando alarcon mantilla 
told the meeting the strategy envisaged a few years ago to 
resolve the debt problem has turned out to have serious 
limitations 
he complained about the economic programs the countries have put 
into place to win more financial help 
reiteration of the economic adjustment efforts he said 
is increasingly straining the peoples capacity to bear their 
consequences and the programs are floundering in an intolerable 
vicious circle 
botswanas finance minister ps mmusi said more and more 
countries are reaching the point where further austerity in the 
absence of meaningful economic growth has become politically 
socially and economically untenable 
the debtor countries want more money from the banks to get their 
economies moving but the bankers have been reluctant to do that 
lawson also threw cold water on a japanese proposal to reduce 
the weight of the dollar as an international reserve currency and 
boost the importance of a composite currency created by the imf 
the dollar and the german mark are the worlds two leading 
reserve currencies held by governments in their coffers 
sumita said it would be more realistic at this point to 
consider ways of diversifying reserve currencies to complement the 
dollars key role 
he said japan has been removing barriers to the use of the 
japanese currency the yen as an international currency 
the imf currency is known as the special drawing right or sdr 
and its value is based on a basket of currencies including the 
dollar a single sdr is currently worth 129 
the monetary unit is only a bookkeeping measure 
but french finance minister pierre beregovoy said tuesday the 
time has come to make the sdr a more widely used reserve 
currency 
lawson said there has been a persistent effort to substitute the 
dollar for the imf currency 
it hasnt come to anything said lawson and i dont 
believe it is likely to do so

the federal energy regulatory commission today 
sent the proposed merger between pacificorp and utah power amp light 
co back to its staff for further information 
the ferc staff presented the commission with a draft that would 
have permitted the merger but required the combined company to 
auction its excess transmission capacity the utility would then 
have to construct additional transmission capacity when it was 
needed 
the merger between the companies based in portland ore and 
salt lake city would create an 8 billion utility serving 12 
million customers in seven western states 
under the proposal owners of utah powers common shares would 
receive pacificorp stock worth between 3225 and 38 a share 
depending on its average closing price over the 10 days after the 
merger was approved the utility has 596 million shares of common 
stock outstanding 
commissioners asked the ferc staff to justify imposing any 
conditions on the merger and to submit a more detailed 
recommendation next week they then will vote on it individually 
without another formal meeting 
the two utilities say their merger would save them 500 million 
the first five years and that utah powers rates would drop between 
5 percent and 10 percent the proposal would make utah power a 
division of pacificorp along with the latters electricity 
business pacific power amp light co 
the merger has been approved by shareholders of both companies 
and regulators in all the states that would be affected 
a federal administrative law judge recommended ferc deny the 
combination however saying the merger would be anticompetitive 
and that the utilities had failed to show it was in the best 
interest of the public ferc staff lawyers later recommended the 
merger be approved subject to certain conditions 
pacificorp chairman don c frisbee has said his utility would 
not pursue the merger if ferc rejected it 
the proposed merger was approved by regulatory commissions in 
oregon utah washington california idaho wyoming and montana 
because utah powers electricity needs peak in the summer 
airconditioning months and pacific powers are highest during the 
winter heating season the merger would give the combined utility 
as long as a decade before it would have to build new electricity 
plants officials of the two companies have said 
the increased consumption during the winter also would boost 
utahs coal mine production utah power spokesman dave mead said 
earlier this month utah financier ian cummings chairman of the 
new yorkbased holding company leucadia national corp made a 12 
billion cash bid for a majority interest in the privately held 
utility or about 600 million less that pacificorps 
utah power officials refused to comment but wall street 
analysts were baffled why leucadia would be interested in the 
regulated utility saying they did not anticipate any significant 
earnings growth over the next few years as a standalone company 
an oregon utility watchdog organization has sued the state 
public utility commission in an effort to block the merger the 
citizens utility board claims in the lawsuit oregon ratepayers 
would subsidize utah powers ratepayers because the latter would 
receive a rate reduction 
spokesmen for the state agency and pacificorp said safeguards 
are built into the proposal that would prevent oregon ratepayers 
from subsidizing those in utah

futures prices of grain and soybeans closed mixed 
wednesday on the chicago board of trade after a late selloff in 
the wheat market crushed a broad rally 
prices for future delivery of wheat plunged about 8 cents a 
bushel during the sessions last 20 minutes in reaction to a 
report that taiwan had agreed to buy a total of 340000 metric tons 
of wheat from canada over the next three years analysts said 
the news disappointed wheat traders who had been looking for an 
increase in foreign demand for us wheat said walter spilka 
grain market analyst with smith barney harris upham amp co in new 
york 
the wheat market just broke down late in the session and that 
was enough to pull the corn market back down spilka said the 
soybeans which had rallied pretty well on the day also began to 
pull back 
most of the buying that had fueled the rally earlier in the day 
was inspired by technical market factors he said adding that the 
corn and soybean markets were jittery due to the selling pressure 
generated by the advancing harvest 
at the close wheat was 4 cents to 5 cents lower with the 
contract for delivery in december at 416 a bushel corn was 
cent lower to 2 cents higher with december at 286 a bushel oats 
were 1 cent lower to 2 cents higher with december at 245 a 
bushel soybeans were 4 cents lower to 5 cents higher with 
november at 813 a bushel

a federal judge has left unresolved whether the 
government can freeze money of innocent members in an investment 
firm that is involved in a racketeering case an issue in the 
federal campaign against securities fraud 
us district judge robert l carter hearing the case against 
five members of a small investment firm who were indicted on 
racketeering charges last month asked attorneys on tuesday to 
present legal briefs on the issue before he makes a ruling 
the case against the defendants partners in princetonnewport 
partners a small investment firm based in princeton nj has 
attracted widespread interest because they are the first securities 
professionals ever to be indicted under the racketeer influenced 
and corrupt organizations law 
convictions under that law carry enormous financial penalties 
and in this case could possibly put princetonnewport out of 
business although it and other unindicted partners have not been 
accused of any crime 
lawyers following the case have said its implications also are 
significant because of a similar indictment that could emerge 
against drexel burnham lambert inc the giant wall street 
investment firm accused by the securities and exchange commission 
of widespread securities fraud 
drexel has denied those accusations but if it or any drexel 
employees was indicted under the racketeering law a freeze on 
drexel assets could seriously compromise and possibly cripple the 
firms ability to do business 
last week a federal appeals court said the government could 
place controls on princetonnewports assets to preserve property 
that might have to be forfeited should the defendants be found 
guilty of the racketeering charges but the appellate court also 
returned the case to a lower court for more consideration 
federal prosecutors argued before carter on tuesday that the 
government should be able to reach beyond the indicted parters 
personal assets and their interest in princetonnewport should 
those assets fall short of the amount the government wants to set 
aside for possible forfeiture 
that amount has not been disclosed but is believed to be between 
30 and 50 million 
defense attorneys have said only their clients interests in the 
partnership could be subject to forfeiture 
a federal grand jury in august indicted five princetonnewport 
partners and a former drexel trader on charges they engaged in a 
racketeering conspiracy to create illicit tax losses through phony 
stock deals 
the manhattan us attorneys office has said it expects to 
issue a new indictment against them in late november which would 
replace the earlier indictment but has not given details

cincinnati bell inc acknowledged wednesday 
that it faces three lawsuits alleging that company employees 
illegally tapped customers telephones 
the phone company acknowledged the suits in a report to the 
securities and exchange commission 
two fired former cincinnati bell employees robert draise and 
leonard gates testified before a cincinnati federal grand jury 
earlier this month that they installed monitoring devices on 
hundreds of business and private telephone lines as part of their 
jobs for more than a decade starting in 1972 
they said people whose phones were tapped included business 
executives lawyers police officials a black muslim group and 
us district judge carl rubin chief judge in the federal southern 
district of ohio 
cincinnati bell has repeatedly denied that it acted improperly 
or that it ordered or authorized illegal wiretapping the company 
said it intends to vigorously defend itself 
among those who have sued cincinnati bell so far is harold 
mills a former cincinnati police vice squad commander who retired 
in january 1986 
cincinnati bell said it has not been served with any summons 
but has learned that the lawsuit complaints are similar each suit 
charges the company with having illegally engaged in wiretap 
activities violated federal and state laws and wrongfully 
intruded into the private lives of the plaintiffs 
the three lawsuits were filed in us district court for 
southern ohio each suit asks a total of 112 million in damages 
from the company cincinnati bell said in its sec filing 
draise and gates said they told the grand jury that some of the 
taps were installed on company orders while others were ordered by 
the cincinnati police and the fbi only a federal judge can 
authorize electronic eavesdropping 
cincinnati bell has said draise resigned as a repairman in 1979 
to avoid being fired after he was convicted of a federal 
misdemeanor involving a tap on a friends line gates has filed a 
federal court lawsuit contesting his 1986 firing as a supervisor 
cincinnati bell said he was fired because he was hostile and 
insubordinate

the market mimicked the weakness in gold prices 
the main buyers wednesday were commercial consumers of platinum 
said richard levine vice president of the precious metals and 
foreign exchange group of elders futures inc 
this indicates a lot of consumers of platinum have been 
waiting for a decline in price to cover their requirements there

still be there if the market goes back down

british publisher robert maxwell went to 
court wednesday to challenge macmillan incs 25 billion merger 
ageeement with a major investment firm charging that the bidding 
process had been rigged 
a day earlier macmillan said it agreed to be acquired by 
kohlberg kravis roberts amp co for 9005 a share in cash and 
securities the bid was selected above maxwells latest offer also 
unveiled tuesday of 89 in cash for each of macmillans 278 
million outstanding shares 
presenting their arguments to the delaware chancery court 
maxwell attorneys challenged macmillans lockup agreement with 
kohlberg which they said ensured the buyout firm would reap 
macmillans crown jewels even in the event the firm did not 
acquire the company 
a hearing was scheduled for oct 10 
under terms of their merger agreement macmillan granted 
kohlberg an option to buy four businesses under certain 
circumstances those businesses include macmillans direct 
marketing group the diretory division which publishes whos who 
and other directories the berlitz language schools and michie 
co which publishes state legal codes 
supporting maxwells challenge was the robert m bass group of 
texas which controls 92 percent of macmillan and which sparked 
the bidding war for the publishing and information services company 
four months ago the bass group initially offered to acquire 
macmillan for 64 a share but backed out when the price began to 
rise steeply 
bass seeks the right to choose for itself between the 
competing offers and the lockup denies us of that ability said 
josy ingersoll an attorney for bass in delaware 
in filing a motion to intervene in maxwells case bass charged 
that macmillan directors breached their fiduciary duty to bass 
and other shareholders by granting the lockup ingersoll said 
maxwell initially had filed suit challenging macmillans 
poison pill plan which makes an unwanted takeover 
prohibitively expensive that suit was amended to include maxwells 
request to block the lockup agreement 
maxwell head of maxwell communication corp had asked 
macmillan to conduct a fair auction and thus far the auction has 
been rigged said maxwell attorney dennis kelleher at the hearing 
in addition to allegations that macmillan had tied up its best 
businesses maxwell has complained that macmillan failed to honor 
his request that he have an opportunity to top any bid the company 
received 
i am shocked that they would enter into this hasty 
illconceived junkbond financed offer with kkr without even 
contacting me he said in a statement tuesday 
maxwell said he believed members of the financial community 
have valued the kohlberg bid at less than 89 a share 
in midseptember the macmillan board approved kohlbergs 
initial 85ashare proposal but withdrew its backing last week 
after maxwell raised his offer to 8680 a share from 80

percent of bethlehems outstanding common shares the rights plan

president reagan on wednesday vetoed 
legislation designed to toughen curbs on textile apparel and shoe 
imports arguing it would have disastrous effects on the 
economy at a time when exports are booming 
only minutes after rejecting the textile measure in private 
reagan went before television cameras in the rose garden to sign a 
bill paving the way for a multibilliondollar freetrade zone with 
canada 
in both cases reagan said he was acting to lower prices for 
consumers and to ensure jobs for workers 
the textile bill intended to protect american industries 
against foreign competition won final congressional approval last 
friday 
but reagan in a veto message released by the white house said 
this bill represents protectionism at its worst 
the measure won congressional approval without the twothirds 
margin needed to override a veto and white house spokesman marlin 
fitzwater expressed confidence that reagans veto would be 
sustained 
the house passed the bill by a vote of 248150 on sept 23 and 
the bill won senate approval by a 5936 vote on sept 13 
the president lavished praise on the canadian freetrade 
agreement calling it a hallmark of free trade and the 
antithesis of the textile measure hed just vetoed 
but the treaty has no force as yet because it is bottled up in 
the canadian senate and its fate depends on the outcome of the 
canadian election 
protectionism does not save jobs reagan said in his veto 
message he contended the textile bill would have disastrous 
effects on the us economy 
it would impose needless costs on american consumers threaten 
jobs in our export industries jeopardize our overseas farm sales 
and undermine our efforts to obtain a more open trading system for 
us exports reagan said 
at a time when american exports are booming the united states 
must not embark on a course that would diminish our trade 
opportunities he added 
the president called the textile and apparel industries the 
most protected sector of our economy and said they were 
undeserving of further aid 
reagan charged that prices would climb and break the clothing 
budgets of many american families if the legislation took effect 
with every move that has arisen on capitol hill to strengthen 
textile imports reagan has pledged to veto any resulting 
legislation 
for eight years this administration has pursued antiworker 
antiwages antiemployment policies in vetoing this trade 
bill president reagan refuses to give the textile apparel and 
footwear industries the time they need to prepare and modernize for 
international competition said house speaker jim wright 
dtexas of the presidents action 
fitzwater said reagan vetoed the bill as soon as it arrived from 
capitol hill on wednesday morning 
asked about possible repercussions from the veto on vice 
president george bushs election effort in the south where even 
some staunch republicans back the bill fitzwater replied its 
our belief that politics aside protectionism is the issue 
here 
the bill would 
freeze textile and apparel imports at 1987 levels this year and 
limit growth to 1 percent annually starting in january 
freeze imports of nonrubber footwear with no provision for 
increases 
impose import quotas on 180 categories of textile products and 
30 types of footwear a system that would be reviewed after 10 
years 
set up a oneyear program under which the government would 
auction off import licenses and set a special quota for silk 
neckties 
anticipating the veto rep butler derrick dsc said friday 
that he expected congress to mount an effort next week to override 
reagans action 
the house approved the bill on a vote of 248150 on friday 
earlier this month the senate approved the measure 5936 
the textile and apparel industries along with a number of 
unions and their congressional allies called the bill vital to 
stemming job losses they point to the loss of more than 400000 
jobs in the 1980s when a surge of imports hit the us market 
while acknowledging that industry earnings have recovered 
somewhat they say profits have dropped again imports still are 
flooding american markets and plants still are closing 
but the measures critics including retailers importers and 
the administration dispute those claims and warn that new curbs 
would trigger retaliation against us exports 
the opponents contend the industry is flourishing because of 
increases in efficiency and automation sparked by increased 
competition 
the free trade agreement with canada was approved by the senate 
on sept 19 by a vote of 830 
the bill calls for a 10year phaseout of tariffs and a number 
of other trade curbs under the pact signed in january by the 
president and the canadian prime minister 
the presidents signature clears the way for us action in 
phasing out tariffs on 131 billion in merchandise that crosses the 
uscanada border each year 
the agreement was approved this year by the canadian house of 
commons but leaders of the the canadian senate have said they will 
delay action until prime minister brian mulroney holds an election 
there is speculation in canada that mulroney will call an election 
for late november he is four years into his term and is a strong 
supporter of the agreement

the senate approved and sent president reagan 
on wednesday the first major revision of the nations pesticide 
control law in a decade calling for speeded up safety reviews of 
some 600 farm chemicals 
senate agriculture committee chairman patrick j leahy dvt 
told a news conference after senate approval on a voice vote that 
the measure gives us a solid start on the long walk toward 
pesticide reform 
he and sen richard g lugar rind a cosponsor acknowledged 
the measure was silent on key provisions urged by a broad spectrum 
of environmentalists but the two lawmakers called the bill the 
best that could be achieved with only weeks remaining before 
lawmakers go home for the year 
the legislation is a response to years of warnings from 
environmental groups it would set a nineyear deadline for safety 
reviews that otherwise would not be completed until the year 2024 
according to an estimate by the general accounting office 
pesticide manufacturers would assume most of the financial 
burden of the testing process through fees designed to raise 160 
million 
under the threeyear reauthorization of the 1947 federal 
insecticide fungicide and rodenticide act fifra the chemical 
companies that manufacture pesticides also would pay for storage 
and disposal of the chemicals the obligation currently is that of 
the federal government 
socalled indemnity payments that have cost the epa 20 million 
to buy up stocks of banned pesticides also would be phased out 
under the bill at least as they apply to manufacturers 
socalled end users however still would receive indemnity 
payments under the measure as would chemical companies that already 
are slated to receive them as a result of action already taken by 
the epa 
concern over the pesticide issue stems from research findings 
that some pesticides cause cancer birth defects and other severe 
health problems the chemicals are an outgrowth of world war ii 
chemical warfare research and are widely used throughout us 
agriculture 
traces of pesticides are found in many foods on the american 
dinner table 
missing from the legislation was any provision dealing with the 
growing problem of pesticide contamination of ground water 
the capitol hillbased us public interest research group said 
in a report two weeks ago that 73 pesticides were found in ground 
water in 34 states according to an inspection of epa records the 
agency said that some of the findings may have been false alarms 
but that the basic range was correct 
ground water provides the basic drinking supply for an estimated 
113 million americans and environmental groups have been pushing 
for a provision to safeguard ground water 
the senate environment and public works committee considered 
such bill earlier this year but it was not contained in the version 
approved by the house last week 
in its action the senate merely approved the housepassed bill 
and sent it on to the presidents desk because of the absence of a 
ground water provision environmentalists were only lukewarm toward 
the legislation 
as passed the bill does not even qualify for a bronze 
medal said rick hind of the us public interest research group 
on a scale of one to ten it deserves a three and is appropriately 
dubbed fifra lite 
this gives congress another excuse to postpone important 
issues like ground water farm worker safety and food safety he 
added 
chairman e kika de la garza dtexas told lawmakers that 
the measure represented the best compromise obtainable as a divided 
congress pushed toward adjournment in perhaps three weeks 
five leading members of the senate agriculture committee 
circulated a letter to lawmakers this week urging them to vote for 
the measure because it represented the only realistic way to get 
simple but significant action on the pesticide issue in this 
congress 
environmentalists have been pushing for changes in fifra since 
1962 when naturalist rachel carson sparked interest in the issue 
with her bestselling silent spring congress has acted several 
times since then but little has been accomplished in the realm of 
reviewing pesticide safety and only three such chemicals have been 
fully banned

despite massive service cutbacks for 
fall and the layoffs of more than 3000 employees eastern airlines 
president phil bakes announced a 10 percent increase in flights 
this winter 
bakes said flights would be added to the carriers schedule nov 
1 and dec 15 but would not elaborate about the increases 
the increases would be in easterns core markets along the 
east coast and in latin america company spokeswoman paula musto 
said tuesday she ruled out a return to cities eastern recently 
abandoned 
while company officials said it was too early to talk about 
possibly recalling laidoff workers union leaders said eastern has 
to bring back some workers if it plans flight increases 
the problem is the rest of the work force has been cut down to 
the bone said john knudson a spokesman for the air line pilots 
association 
the miamibased carrier earlier this month closed its kansas 
city hub halted service to 14 cities and eliminated 4000 jobs 
more than 3000 people have been laid off with others targeted for 
leaves of absence or early retirements 
many of its 3500 pilots are owed thousands of hours of vacation 
time much of which will be deferred until 1989 so as to boost 
flights this year bakes said 
bakes announced the increases to a meeting of travel agents here 
in a move to reassure agents that eastern can overcome bitter 
negotiations with its unions over contract concessions and 
financial problems 
the airline has 400 million in cash bakes said enough to 
compete effectively in its traditional east coast and latin 
american markets 
we intend to spend it as we have been on our very basic 
business bakes said 
but union officials point out that eastern has loaned 40 
million to its sister carrier continental airlines and they allege 
that asset sales are designed to diminish the unions influence 
the unions have challenged easterns layoffs and cutback plans 
and a federal appeals court in washington is expected to rule on 
the layoffs this week

audi 5000 owners are seeking compensation from the company saying 
bad publicity over sudden acceleration has reduced the cars resale 
value 
wednesdays court hearing was mostly a procedural matter in 
which rakowski asked attorneys to draft motions on how many people 
should be covered in the new class of plaintiffs 
some attorneys will ask rakowski to include people who say they 
were injured or had property damaged by audi 5000s that suddenly 
accelerated 
personal injury claims are not suited to classaction 
treatment solovy said i predict it will go down in flames 
the class would have been much better served if the settlement 
was approved he said 
the next hearing date was not set but is not expected for months 
audi based in troy mich defends the audi 5000 
its a good car its a safe car everyone should buy it 
solovy said its a silly case if the federal government doesnt 
think this is an unsafe car how will plaintiffs prove it 
robert f lisco one of the chief attorneys representing current 
and former car owners does not believe people who claim personal 
injury or property damage should be part of the lawsuit 
i think it will cause more problems than it solves lisco 
said 
the cook county case involves cars built between 1978 and 1986

galanis was sentenced wednesday to 27 years in prison for 
masterminding multimillion dollar fraud and racketeering schemes 
from coast to coast 
a federal court jury on july 5 convicted galanis 45 formerly 
of greenwich conn and now of del mar calif on 44 various 
counts of participating in a racketeering enterprise that looted 
banks fleeced investors and defrauded the government of taxes 
in a prepared statement for the court galanis admitted he was 
responsible for what happened 
my arrogance did not allow me to fully examine the events 
through anothers eyes he said i thought of myself as a kind 
man imparting good values not a racketeer 
the government in a lengthy presentence report contended galanis 
directed a sophisticated criminal enterprise consisting of a 
cohesive group of associated individuals and entitieswhose 
activities defrauded investors financial institutions and the 
public of 150 million in a series of schemes over a period of 
years 
galanis took most of the money to support the extravagant 
lifestyle to which he had become accustomed during his decades of 
unrelenting criminal activities the report said and learned no 
lesson from a previous conviction of conspiracy to violate 
securities laws 
this sentence which is in my experience the heaviest yet 
imposed for white collar crime sends precisely the right message 
to wealthy and privileged crooks who cheat to make additional 
millions upon millions us attorney rudolph giuliani said after 
sentencing 
us district judge charles brieant sentenced galanis who had 
faced a maximum penalty of 207 years in prison and 8 million in 
fines 
brieant last week sentenced galanis codefendant anthony 
marchese 48 of southport conn to 20 years in prison 
the judge agreed to allow galanis to remain free on 20 million 
bond over the governments objections 
galanis allegedly masterminded a phony oil and gasdrilling tax 
shelter scheme that netted more than 172 million in fraudulent tax 
writeoffs for about 2500 investors 
the socalled galanis organization also left a rockland 
county bank insolvent fraudulently took over a westport conn 
bank forced utah banking officials to take over another financial 
institution in salt lake city and stole 39 million from three 
california mutual funds 
the galanis organization allegedly bribed officials of the 
peoples national bank of rockland county in monsey ny 
fraudulently took over heritage bank in salt lake city seized 
control of columbia federal savings bank in westport conn through 
fraudulent misrepresentations to federal regulators and illegally 
took over isi mutual funds in oakland calif and stole 4 million 
in mutual fund assets 
peoples national bank collapsed in 1985 and was taken over by 
the first national bank of highland falls while in 1987 heritage 
bank came under the control of the state of utah 
eleven other people pleaded guilty for their roles in galanis 
various schemes and nine testified against him said assistant us

a dallas judge summarily ruled in favor of hunt 
oil co wednesday in a 1 billion suit accusing the company of 
scheming to deprive other oil companies of oil and gas concessions 
in north yemen 
arabian shield development co of dallas and dorchester master 
limited partnership of houston filed the suit against hunt oil 
chairman ray l hunt and yemenhunt oil co last october 
arabian shield is an energy and mineral company controlled by 
dallas businessman jack crichton and some saudi princes 
crichton alleged hunt and his partners in 1981 acted wrongfully 
to deprive the plaintiffs of an exclusive contract to explore and 
produce oil and gas in a 140000squaremile tract in the middle 
east nation and to win the rights for themselves 
the hunts accused crichton and his partners of filing a baseless 
suit to achieve economic rewards they were unable to win through 
direct negotiations with the yemeni government 
a motion for summary judgment was filed in july by the hunt firm 
and heard in august by 116th district court judge frank andrews 
we feel the decision by the court to grant our motion for 
summary judgment is a total and unqualified vindication ray hunt 
said in a news release 
hunt noted that several weeks after the suit was filed the yemen 
arab republic government officially refuted the allegations 
ray hunt is halfbrother to nelson bunker hunt william herbert 
hunt and lamar hunt but operates a separate energy and real estate 
empire he is not involved in the three hunt brothers financial 
travails 
andrews also ruled the defendants were entitled to recover all 
legal costs incurred in the suit 
crichton 47 was a personal friend of hunts late father hl 
hunt and a former board member of the hunt family foundation 
arabian shield and dorchester plan to appeal the judgment in 30 
days according to a statement issued by arabian shield 
this is only the first round in a fight in which dorchester 
and arabian shield intend to pursue until arabian shielddorchester 
have recovered the damages sufferedfrom the illegal actions of 
hunt oil company in securing the oil production sharing agreement 
in north yemen the statement said 
the alif field was developed in north yemen in 1984 by hunt oil 
the plaintiffs claimed crichton and several associates first 
found evidence of oil reserves in north yemen in 1955 and signed an 
agreement with the governement but political turmoil including a 
lengthy civil war prevented development of the tract 
an updated agreement negotiated in 1981 by dorchester and 
arabian shield the legal successors to the parties given the 1955 
contract was awaiting final approval of the north yemeni 
government when it suddenly was canceled the suit said 
hunt oil through its yemenhunt oil co subsidiary then was 
awarded a contract for rights to the tract in september 1981 the 
suit alleges

a federal court judge on wednesday 
dismissed a motion that would have given a group of dissident 
shareholders leverage to depose zenith electronic corps board of 
directors 
us district judge joseph j farnan dismissed the challenge 
from brookhurst partners because he said federal court did not have 
jurisdiction over the subject matter 
brookhurst spokesman tom franco said the group would sue zenith 
in delaware state court which we believe to be the correct 
forum 
brookhurst is seeking shareholder support to dump seven of 
zeniths 10 directors trim the board to six members and fill three 
of those seats with nominees committed to selling the television 
and computer maker 
brookhurst had asked the court to strike down a company bylaw 
that requires approval from all shareholders not just a majority 
for such a move 
zenith which is incorporated in delaware but based in glenview 
ill unilaterally agreed monday to such a change but franco said 
the companys action was not enough and brookhurst still was 
seeking access to the companys shareholder lists and financial 
records 
there are other claims and we believe that they remain worthy 
of the courts consideration franco said in a telephone 
interview wednesday night were hopeful that there will be a 
prompt resolution of the remaining claims 
franco said the group would file a motion thursday in delaware 
chancery court seeking to exempt brookhursts solicitation from 
zeniths poison pill takeover defense 
the plan now gives zenith the right to dilute its holdings if 
any one shareholder gains consent for change from 15 percent of the 
shares 
brookhurst is a limited partnership that owns 61 percent of 
zenith stock which makes the group the companys largest 
stockholder 
zenith stock rose 50 cents to 2062 a share wednesday in new 
york stock exchange trading
