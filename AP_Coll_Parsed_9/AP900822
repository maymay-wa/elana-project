californias presidential primary 
would be advanced from june to the first tuesday in march under 
legislation approved wednesday by a twohouse conference committee 
of the state legislature 
the proposal sent to the floors of both houses for final votes 
before their aug 31 adjournment would place californias primary 
just one week after new hampshires firstinthe nation primary 
california political leaders of both parties support the change 
saying it would transform the primary from a political afterthought 
in the presidential sweepstakes to what could be the dominant early 
primary 
were trying to become a stronger player in national 
politics state sen ken maddy of fresno the republican leader 
in the senate said wednesday 
however the 50 vote of the twohouse committee for the early 
primary plan still doesnt assure its passage assembly speaker 
willie brown a democrat said the shift wouldnt be approved in 
unless it won support from all the party leaders in both house 
maddy said he and many republican legislators prefer a plan that 
moves the presidential primary to march and all other primaries to 
september the plan sent to the senate and assembly floors leaves 
the other primaries on the first tuesday in june the same date as 
the presidential primary 
the last time the state proved crucial in the primaries was 
1972 when george mcgovern used his victory over hubert humphrey to 
capture the nomination at the national democratic convention barry 
goldwaters victory over nelson rockefeller in californias 1964 
primary was the last time the state played a role in picking the 
gop nominee for president 
the lack of influence rankles many in the state especially 
because california sends by far the largest delegations to both 
national conventions 
supporters of the measure sponsored by democratic assemblyman 
jim costa say that because of the states late primary 
presidential hopefuls of both parties ignore california except for 
brief visits to raise money for their races in new hampshire iowa 
and other early primary and caucus states 
opponents of the move say it would favor wellheeled 
presidential candidates giving those who can raise early campaign 
contributions an edge in the nations largest state 
the dispute over whether to leave californias congressional 
legislative and other primaries in june or shift them to september 
involves complicated and obscure tactical considerations political 
strategists argue about which party would benefit from shortening 
the period between the primary and general election from five to 
two months

a second grand jury to investigate the april 10 shooting of 
16yearold phillip c pannell by teaneck officer gary spath 
were here to send them our message which is they have to 
stop using officer spath and partner wayne blanco as pawns in 
their political game said steve librie president of the teaneck 
policemens benevolent association theyre trying to make spath 
a scapegoat for everything thats wrong with society 
the officers rallied outside the bergen county courthouse in 
hackensack chanting dump del tufo dump florio they then 
marched several miles from hackensack to teaneck and congregated 
outside a municipal building

with a gun have said spath fired only when he saw pannell reaching 
for a gun at his waist witnesses said pannell had his hands in the 
air when the shot was fired 
a second grand jury is to review the evidence because of a 
faulty autopsy report to the first grand jury by bergen county

the rallying police officers black and white chanted he 
had a gun 
nutley police officer steven rogers said more than 2500

karl otto poehl president of the 
mighty bundesbank is supervising the painful transformation of 
east germany into part of a capitalist state 
he assumed the job with reluctance but appears to be the right 
man for it 
with a keen sense of politics the man in charge of west 
germanys central bank swept his doubts aside and accepted the role 
thrust on him by chancellor helmut kohls decision to unite the two 
germanys more quickly than anticipated 
only days before kohl announced his plans for monetary union of 
west and east germany poehl still spoke of it cautiously as 
something that would take at least a year 
insiders say poehl was furious over kohls failure to consult 
him but the banker saw quickly which way the political weathervane 
pointed he accepted kohls decision and the west german mark 
became east germanys currency july 1 
during the monetary union poehl the politician had no trouble 
silencing poehl the economist said der spiegel the west german 
news magazine 
when the government and public opinion wanted monetary union 
poehl could not play the role of a nagging accountant it said 
poehl opposed to a 11 exchange rate of east and west marks 
succeeded in persuading the government to limit the amount that 
could be exchanged at the generous rate 
the government went along with many of his suggestions and the 
bundesbank is now firmly in control of the monetary policy 
warren oliver an economist in london said in a telephone 
interview 
east germany surrendered its monetary sovereignty to the 
bundesbank 
as guardian of the stability of the west german mark one of the 
worlds most powerful currencies poehl was concerned about the 
possible inflationary effect of giving east germanys hungry 
consumers 25 billion marks 156 billion overnight 
keeping inflation in check has been one of poehls primary jobs 
since becoming president of the central bank in january 1980 
inflation is one of the worst economic ills to germans because 
the weimar republics worthless currency contributed to the rise of 
adolf hitler 
bundesbank autonomy is guaranteed by the constitution but the 
government chooses its president the chancellor gave poehl a 
second eightyear term in 1987 even though the banker belongs to 
the leftleaning social democratic party the opposition to kohls 
centerright government 
the central bank presidency is the bestpaying government 
position in germany 600000 marks a year or 375000 
some officials in the more conservative wing of kohls coalition 
wanted poehl replaced but could find no one with his experience and 
international reputation 
analysts agree the strength of the mark would have suffered if 
poehl had not been reappointed 
poehl 60 years old and slightly stocky is the longestserving 
central bank chief in the seven leading industrialized nations and 
oliver said the most successful central banker of the last 
decade a word from poehl is enough to move world financial 
markets 
from the sprawling bundesbank headquarters on the outskirts of 
frankfurt poehl travels regularly to washington and other world 
capitals he also is a ranking officer of the international 
monetary fund 
he was born dec 1 1929 in hanover and earned an economics 
degree in 1955 in seven years as an economics journalist for 
several publications and radio stations he built good personal 
relations with important officials 
after joining the economics ministry in 1970 poehl became an 
adviser to chancellor willy brandt the next year and in 1972 the 
ministrys no 2 man 
while at the ministry he played important roles in freeing 
exchange rates and creating the european monetary system he joined 
the bundesbank as a vice president in 1977 three years before 
becoming its chief 
insiders say poehl is easygoing and relaxed at his job and once 
prepared himself for the washington heat by removing his tie and 
socks in the plane he is fluent in english loves to play golf and 
has a wit often laced with sarcasm 
he is said to have told table companions at a washington dinner 
well probably have to feed soviet soldiers now but luckily 
their living standard is lower than that of the american 
soldiers about 380000 soviet soldiers are stationed in east 
germany 
oliver the london economist said poehl was regarded as 
collegial quite open he is very cosmopolitan and is able to 
tolerate differences of style 
perhaps that comes from his journalistic background and 
journalists tend to go to him at big meetings because they know he 
has something to say oliver added the bundesbank is very 
successful in the public relations area 
poehl endorses a common european currency and european central 
bank in principle but has expressed doubts whether governments are 
ready to allow such a bank the necessary autonomy 
analysts say poehl would be a perfect choice to head a european 
central bank

they were just four of the millions who 
perished in nazi camps but in the shadow of death the jewish 
composers created a musical legacy that has outlived the horror of 
their fates 
today a musician is organizing performances of the almost 
forgotten pieces by gideon klein pavel haas viktor ullmann and 
hans krasa musicians imprisoned in a concentration camp in 
nazioccupied czechoslovakia 
its amazing and its inspiring says mark ludwig a boston 
symphony orchestra violist our mission is to make the public 
aware not only of the great talents of these artists but theres a 
spiritual resistance a spiritual form of resistance which is also 
very inspiring 
ludwig spent two years tracking down scores from composers at 
the nazi camp in terezin czechoslovakia a village north of 
prague he concentrated on the four composers who had promising 
careers in prewar prague krasas first symphony for example 
had been performed by the boston orchestra in 1926 
many of the scores came from the state jewish museum in prague 
and the terezin national monument where they had been deposited 
after the war and largely ignored others came from survivors 
entrusted with the music 
some of the pieces mainly chamber music express a great deal 
of pain and desolation ludwig said there are also others that 
are reminiscent of times past good times if you will a way of 
momentarily distracting the audience from their environment 
people are just so moved by the power because the soul is 
coming out he said during a recent interview at the orchestras 
summer home you dont have to be so sophisticated it just 
touches you its so deeply felt 
the concentration camp known as theresienstadt originally was a 
walled garrison town the camp served as a way station for 
transports to death camps in the east and as the center of a nazi 
propaganda effort 
at the camp the musical community sometimes had to keep out of 
sight holding rehearsals in attics and basements of the town 
after they learned of the makeshift concerts nazi guards at 
first allowed them as part of their efforts to create the 
appearance of a model camp later the cultural activities often 
were forbidden as a disciplinary measure 
ullmann wrote a short allegorical opera about life in the camp 
which was rehearsed but was not allowed to be performed ludwig 
said the composer almost took the score with him when he was sent 
to auschwitz but was persuaded by friends to leave the music 
behind 
to bring the music before the public ludwig founded the 
nonprofit terezin chamber music foundation so far concerts have 
been held in worcester and at a holocaust memorial service at the 
massachusetts statehouse concerts are planned next year for 
amsterdam boston and the berkshires 
the pieces mainly short works such as string trios quartets 
and sonatas carry melodic slavic influences and ludwig believes 
are destined to become part of chamber musics repertoire 
next years programs include music that hasnt been heard since 
it was first written and performed in the concentration camp a 
time when the musicians probably were never sure of their fate 
ludwig said 
you still hold that hope when you think about it creativity 
thats a form of hope too even in a horrendous environment in 
the worst of times if one is creating one is expressing there is 
a need theres a hope

iraqs invasion of kuwait has forced 
saudi arabia to make a fundamental and perhaps permanent change in 
its public approach to the outside world 
the invasion forced saudi arabia long equivocal about its links 
with the west to publicly ally itself with the united states 
despised by many arabs for its support of israel the united arab 
emirates and other persian gulf states have followed saudi king 
fahds lead declaring their support for us forces on their soil 
for more than four decades the saudis have tried to conceal 
their close economic cooperation with americans and the us 
military presence in the cradle of islam but the aug 2 overthrow 
of kuwaits royal family the oldest dynasty in the gulf region 
underlined the fragility of the gulf kingdoms and sheikdoms 
saudi unease had already been triggered by the collapse of the 
shah of iran in the 1979 islamic revolution across the gulf 
king fahd had little choice in the face of iraqi president 
saddam husseins military actions but to call in the americans and 
their allies to protect his kingdom and its vast oil fields 
the only alternative was unthinkable to sit back and watch 
saddam overrun the united arab emirates qatar and eventually 
saudi arabia itself said an arab diplomat who spoke on 
condition of anonymity 
despite lavishing billions of dollars on sophisticated military 
hardware over the years king fahds untested 120000strong armed 
forces are no match against saddams battleseasoned hordes 
like other arab rulers the saudi royal family saw that 
grassroots support for saddam among the regions 200 million 
arabs long envious of the gulfs oil riches was a mushrooming 
radical force 
since king abdulaziz founded the alsaud dynasty in the 1920s 
by conquering rival bedouin clans and forging the saudi state his 
descendants policy has been survival at any cost 
like other gulf oil states the saudis have long avoided discord 
by sheltering behind their islamic piety and consensus politics 
us ties date back to 1945 when abdulaziz made an unwritten 
alliance with the united states the americans edging out the 
british secured the first oil concessions in 1933 giving 
washington strategic interests in saudi arabia 
fahd told his estimated 8 million subjects two weeks ago that he 
had invited the americans to help him reinstate the alsabahs in 
kuwait and defend saudi arabia against a possible iraqi attack 
since then the americans have been pouring troops and materiel 
into saudi arabia fahd has sought to placate his islamic critics 
these forces from friendly powers are here temporarily and 
will leave as soon as the kingdom so demands he stressed in a 
nationwide statement aug 9 he reiterated it aug 21 
but with saddam deploying an estimated 200000 men in and around 
kuwait and showing no sign of pulling out of the former emirate 
the americans may be around for awhile 
everyone accepts that theres going to be a longterm american 
military presence said a senior gulf official who spoke on 
condition he was not named its no secret that saudi arabia and 
other gulf countries willingly accept whatever it takes to ensure 
their stability if necessary they will accept an increased 
american presence here 
thats a dramatic aboutface for the saudis who have long 
sought to play down their western orientation while paying lip 
service to arab nationalism and the palestinians struggle against 
israel 
the saudi rulers have overseen the transformation of a desert 
backwater into a modern state all the time trying to prevent 
progress from undermining its islamic roots 
much of the royal familys legitimacy rests on islam a few 
years ago fahd stressed this by declaring himself the guardian of 
islams holiest shrines at mecca and medina 
allowing american infidels in to protect the holy places has 
drawn resentment from moslem quarters 
libyan leader moammar gadhafi has for years berated the saudis 
for befriending the united states and urged moslems to stop making 
the annual pilgrimage to mecca as long as it remains under 
american military occupation 
irans islamic revolutionaries have constantly reviled the saudi 
leaders as american stooges and called for the downfall of the 
royal family 
the saudis have long discouraged outsiders peering into their 
world the thousands of westerners americans and others who keep 
the oil flowing live mostly in their own compounds 
that too may be changing with thousands of american gis 
flooding into the onceveiled kingdom 
american and other western journalists have been allowed in and 
events in saudi arabia are now daily on primetime television 
saudi newspapers which until recently ignored controversial 
subjects are now reporting the harsh realities facing the kingdom 
arab reporters however have been advised to refer to the us 
presence as part of a multinational force comprising egyptian 
moroccan and other arab units as well

us sen alan simpson and gov mike 
sullivan handily won their primary races tuesday while gop 
gubernatorial candidate mary mead took an early lead in an unusual 
twowoman race for her partys nomination 
with 154 of the states 471 precincts reporting mead had 69 
percent of the vote to state rep nyla murphys 31 percent 
simpson the senate minority whip was easily winning his third 
republican nomination with 83 percent of the early vote 
it wasnt clear which of six littleknown democrats would win 
the right to challenge simpson kathy helling a 32yearold 
college student and al hamburg who was convicted last year of 
forging names on a campaign petition were the top votegetters in 
early returns 
as it was four years ago sullivan walked away with the 
nomination tuesday he got 88 percent of the early vote in his 
primary contest with motorcycle mechanic ron suds clingman 
the governor said he would have preferred to face stiffer 
competition 
i have to say that when you watch people debating the issues 
on the other side you wish you had some primary opposition so you 
could talk about the issues said sullivan 
the hunt for the gop gubernatorial nomination pitted mead 55 
the daughter of former gov and us sen cliff hansen against 
murphy a 59yearold casper woman who has served the past 12 years 
in the state house of representatives 
meads campaign stressed her skills as a rancher and 
businesswoman and attacked sullivans economic development efforts 
murphy in turn accused mead of having a negative attitude 
toward wyoming and of failing to propose solutions to the 
shortfalls she perceived 
sullivan largely ignored the primary campaign and stuck close to 
his gubernatorial duties 
us rep craig thomas was uncontested in the primary elected 
last year to fill dick cheneys unexpired term in office thomas is 
seeking his first fullterm in the house this fall also unopposed 
was his democratic challenger pete maxfield a university of 
wyoming law professor

former hostage frank reed says his 14 western 
comrades in lebanon are forgotten deprived sick men whose plight 
is worsened by the new hostage crisis in the persian gulf god 
forbid they come out in a box he said 
whats frightening is that they could be there for 10 years 
he said in an interview tuesday they told me the day i was 
captured youre going to be here for 20 years im a very lucky 
man to be out 
reed said the 3000 americans held in iraq and kuwait will take 
priority over the six americans and eight other westerners held in 
lebanon by the iranianbacked hezbollah or party of god which is 
believed to be an umbrella group for shiite moslem terrorists 
i think it it will have an overall effect of them being put 
further and further down in the agendas said reed as far as i 
know the american government is doing nothing 
state department spokesman richard boucher said he had no 
comment on reeds remarks 
reed implored the american public to start writing people the 
president their senator their representative to make them aware 
of the humanity that supposedly exists in this country 
for gods sake were talking about almost six years that terry 
anderson and tom sutherland have been in captivity he said 
they should be freed when i left them they were sick this is 
very degenerating 
anderson 42 chief middle east correspondent for the associated 
press is the longest held of the hostages he has been in 
captivity nearly 5 years sutherland 59 acting dean of 
agriculture at the american university of beirut has been held for 
a little over five years 
the other american hostages are joseph cicippio 59 acting 
comptroller at the american university in beirut edward tracy 59 
west beirut resident alann steen 51 a communications instructor 
at beirut university college and jesse turner 42 professor of 
mathematics and computer science at beirut university college 
reed 57 lives in suburban malden he was the founder and 
president of the lebanese international school he was freed in 
april after 3 years in captivity no american hostages have been 
released since then 
reed has criticized the bush administration for its stand 
against negotiating with terrorists 
the demands of the kidnappers in lebanon include the release of 
prisoners held by israel in southern lebanon and terrorists jailed 
in kuwait and western capitals 
there are conflicting reports on the fate of the prisoners in 
kuwait some say they escaped after the iraqi invasion others say 
they have been killed some suggest they have been moved to 
baghdad the iraqi capital 
if the prisoners in kuwait got out the western nations now have 
less to offer to the kidnappers to free the hostages reed said 
the conditions under which the americans in iraq and kuwait are 
being held are not known in lebanon the hostages have been 
blindfolded chained and malnourished reed said he was badly 
beaten apparently for trying to escape twice and poisoned with 
arsenic 
reed said he was sympathetic to american families who have 
relatives among the hostages in iraq and kuwait but i believe 
theyre a hell of a lot safer in that situation than the people i 
left behind are he said

new jersey sen bill bradley knows about 
making the right moves when he sets foot on the farm soil of iowa 
almost 40 years ago as a little leaguer from missouri playing 
baseball in a regional championship in ottumwa iowa he stepped 
off first base and was tagged out the sting of being caught off 
guard has stayed with him 
a more careful bradley recalled the early misstep this week 
during his third trip to the state since 1988 
bradleys visit to the home of the nations first democratic 
presidential caucuses raised questions asked any time a politician 
of national repute steps into the iowa limelight 
i dont know that much about him said elaine baxter iowas 
secretary of state i feel good about the things ive heard the 
respect of his colleagues a very substantive person able to reach 
out to those voters in the middle i would need to see where he 
stands on womens issues economic issues and foreign policy 
standing on a flatbed truck a relaxed bradley addressed a group 
of democrats weaving tales about his pro basketball past with a 
campaign boost for iowa sen tom harkin a fellow democrat 
the crowd looking up from picnic tables applauded they laughed 
at his jokes and many walked away wanting to know more about the 
6foot5 new jersey senator 
as a speaker i thought he was really a surprise said 
gloria sullivan of des moines who anticipated a dry delivery 
bradleys appearances in winterset des moines and cedar rapids 
were read as testing the waters but arthur davis chairman of the 
iowa democratic party from 1985 to 1987 said the real question is 
whether bradley returns to iowa after this falls nov 6 election 
if we see him after november it will be because hes 
interested in exploration davis said 
bradley insists he wants to serve another six years in the 
senate 
to anyone who says anything about the presidency i say no 
im not running for president the twoterm incumbent said 
given his insistence bonnie campbell the democratic candidate 
for iowa attorney general and past state democratic chairman said 
bradleys appearance amounts to good strategy 
if you even had anything on your mind down the road what 
would make democrats think more warmly toward you than helping one 
of the most popular senators in iowa she said 
davis cautioned that iowa might have trouble with a bradley 
candidacy 
are we going to go east again although iowa did go for 
governor dukakis does the salvation of the party lie in eastern 
liberals 
bradleys iowa visit was one of his few this election season on 
behalf of fellow democrats 
he spent friday in texas with ann richards the democratic 
gubernatorial nominee hes also helping raise money for dianne 
feinstein who is running for governor of california and harvey 
gantt who is running for the senate from north carolina 
bradleys opponent republican christine todd whitman has 
accused him of neglecting new jersey interests while in iowa 
bradley argued that he was there so i can collect my chits 
with harkin who as chairman of a senate appropriations 
subcommittee holds the purse strings for several bradley health and 
education bills

the bush administrations decision to add more 
f15 fighters and heavy tanks to saudi arabias defensive shield 
against iraq has an additional benefit officials say drawing the 
onceresistant arab nation closer to the west 
international cooperation in the bid to reverse iraqs invasion 
of kuwait has opened doors long closed to washington defense 
secretary dick cheney said tuesday as he returned from a fourday 
trip to the persian gulf 
i think the degree of cooperation today in terms of us 
military presence and a collective security effort obviously is 
far greater than it has ever been before cheney said 
because the threat from iraq is so serious to the moderate arab 
rulers in the gulf region cheney said nations that previously 
have had sort of an armslength relationship with the us military 
are eager to cooperate with and support our efforts in the region 
and the efforts of the other nations involved 
the secretary was scheduled to brief bush on his trip today in 
kennebunkport maine 
cheneys highspeed swing through the persian gulf was designed 
to gain support for the usled campaign against iraq he visited 
the persian gulf sheikdoms of bahrain the united arab emirates 
oman qatar and saudi arabia to garner support for operation desert 
shield and also stopped in egypt 
with saudi arabias king fahd and defense minister prince 
sultan cheney discussed the monarchys hardware wish list to boost 
the kingdoms defenses against iraqs buildup of about 160000 
troops in occupied kuwait 
a senior pentagon official said the administration intends to 
move quickly to supply additional f15 jet fighters and heavy tanks 
to the desert kingdom 
the saudis want more than the dozen f15s that president bush 
ordered for an emergency transfer during the early days of the 
persian gulf crisis 
cheney told reporters that no specific agreements on weapons 
sales were reached during talks in jiddah 
although cheney declined to say exactly what was being 
discussed he stressed that the saudis need to improve their 
defensive hardware quickly the goal is to keep saddam husseins 
army far away from the strategic saudi oil fields 
we are obviously looking at aircraft were looking at 
munitions to go with the aircraft were looking at things like 
protective antichemical weapons gear antiaircraft capabilities 
and armor munitions cheney said they need tanks in order to 
be able to defend against iraqi tanks so were improving their 
capabilities in that area 
the saudis have purchased usmade f15cs and f15ds and own 58 
of the jets as well as 550 tanks 
but across their northern border iraqs heavily mechanized 
forces possess 5500 tanks and about 500 combat aircraft 
the united states has rushed dozens of its most sophisticated 
f15es f16s and f117a stealth fighter bombers for the operation 
but the saudis want to improve their own defensive position the 
official said 
and although the saudis recently signed a deal to purchase about 
3 billion worth of m1a2 tanks the vehicles wont be ready until 
the mid1990s that makes us stocks of m1a1 or m60 tanks 
candidates for sale given that many armored vehicles will be 
removed from europe if a conventional arms accord is reached with 
the warsaw pact 
asked about a report that cheney was negotiating a deal for a 
saudi purchase of 24 f15es the official said the talks involved 
the less sophisticated f15cs and f15ds but he also declined to 
rule out such a sale the f15e has been updated to give it a much 
wider range of operation and it is equipped with sidewinder and 
sparrow airtoair missiles 
many in congress would be sure to oppose any sale of the updated 
version given concerns for israels security the reagan 
administration was rebuffed several years ago when it attempted to 
sell the saudis the new model 
but such sales could help boost a flagging us defense 
industry which is expected to suffer if some of the proposed 
pentagon budget cuts go through 
prior to a stop in cairo egypt to confer with his counterpart 
there on desert shield cheney told reporters he was pleased with 
the support he had received during his tour 
the united arab emirates announced it would become the second 
nation in the gulf region to host foreign troops that decision 
will help the flow of food ammunition and supplies to the us 
armed forces on land and sea throughout the gulf region 
various nations are cooperating in various ways some are 
providing forces some are providing bases for our forces some 
will help with financial support cheney said

as the greyhound strike grinds well into its 
sixth month with no resolution in sight drivers are using odd 
jobs their savings or unemployment checks to scrape by 
the oldtimers some of them are having a hard time finding 
any other work said darrell horn president of a drivers union 
local in portland ore theyre very despondent but theyre not 
going to go back to work under these conditions 
the bus lines 6000 drivers walked out march 2 over a dispute 
in wages and job security drivers contend they only wanted to 
regain ground they lost after taking pay cuts over the past decade 
that dropped their salaries from 31000 to 24000 
now the bus line currently under the protection of bankruptcy 
court has told those drivers their jobs no longer exist because it 
has resumed business as usual with 3000 strikebreakers it 
hired 
we still consider greyhound as our company the one we built 
the one we gave up our wages for and vacations for just to keep 
the company afloat and give it a chance to breathe bob beard a 
greyhound driver for 29 years said from his home in suburban 
washington 
greyhound contends the union created its own problems with 
excessive wage demands it blames the companys financial trouble 
on security and legal costs stemming from initial strike violence 
it contends was orchestrated by union leaders 
drivers have found a variety of ways to make ends meet jim 
gajdos has a job hawking 1 programs at a minor league ballpark in 
boise idaho for jerry reidell in bellingham wash the dispute 
has meant switching roles with his wife hes now at home with 
their two children while she works at the postal service 
other striking drivers have taken temporary and parttime jobs 
with tour or charter bus companies some have been forced to use 
their savings or are trying to survive on unemployment and 
50aweek strike benefit checks 
most drivers enjoyed their jobs despite the pay cuts because 
of the independence and crosscountry trips strikers said 
people dont really think of us as cowboys but were kind of 
the stagecoach drivers of the 90s gajdos said theres a 
certain romance to the job 
gajdos and reidell have both dipped into their savings to help 
in the pinch of lost paychecks gajdos said that because his 
greyhound pay had dropped over the years hes used to a life 
without the extras 
i guess you could say weve been introduced to poverty on the 
installment plan gajdos said 
many local unions have food bank set up where grocers and 
charities donate canned goods and cereals for drivers 
horn said union drivers are pinning their hopes on some 
potential resolutions 
a bankruptcy judge might replace greyhound chairman fred g 
currey with a trustee willing to resume negotiations with union 
drivers 
a new york investment banking firm the blackstone group could 
take over the company a move it has been studying blackstone has 
said a takeover would include bringing union drivers back and 
possibly allowing employees to have part ownership 
a national labor relations board administrative law judge in 
milwaukee could agree with the boards general counsel and find 
that greyhound engaged in unfair labor practices that would mean 
the bus line would have to take back the union drivers and give 
them as much as 10 million a month in back pay however greyhound 
has already said it would appeal such a decision which could mean 
court battles for years 
greyhound contends its financial problems will be resolved with 
a reorganization plan that streamlines the companys operations 
but that reorganization plan isnt due until october and 
extensions on initial plan deadlines frequently are granted 
frank motsay president of local 1610 in washington said the 
drivers cause has been hurt by a lack of publicity in recent 
months especially since currey held a news conference may 7 and 
said the strike in effect was over because replacements had been 
hired 
you cant unilaterally declare a strike over when you have 
unfair labor practices hanging over your head fred currey is not 
going to end this strike by simply wishing it away motsay said 
labor leaders from other unions have privately said the drivers 
were illprepared for a walkout and should have tried other methods 
first to avoid a strike but many of the striking drivers seem 
determined to continue the walkout

at least 35000 us troops are now in saudi 
arabia or on their way and more will be going says the air force 
general in charge of getting troops to the desert kingdom 
the estimate tuesday by gen hansford t johnson while not 
precise was the clearest official indication of the size of the 
us military buildup which president bush ordered in response to 
iraqs invasion of kuwait three weeks ago 
johnson commander of the us transportation command and 
military airlift command told reporters that the equivalent of 1 
billion pounds of military equipment and soldiers had been shipped 
from us shores to the saudi desert 
he said that was comparable to ferrying 400000 us automobiles 
over that distance 
johnson said military security rules prevented him from 
disclosing the exact number of soldiers or amount of equipment that 
have been sent to saudi arabia but he said weve moved in 
essence the equivalent of a town the size of jefferson city mo 
the population of jefferson city is 35408 according to the 
preliminary 1990 census 
weve also moved all of their equipment cars trucks 
foodstuffs stocks household goods and water supply johnson 
said 
in addition to the us ground forces in saudi arabia an 
estimated 20000 sailors are deployed on warships in the persian 
gulf the arabian sea the red sea and the mediterranean as part of 
operation desert shield to defend against a possible iraqi attack 
johnson said he could not discuss planned additional 
deployments but pentagon sources have said contingency plans call 
for sending as many as 250000 troops depending on iraqi military 
moves 
an administration source gave a different figure tuesday saying 
defense secretary dick cheney and gen colin powell chairman of 
the joint chiefs of staff planned to tell bush today that the 
united states was approaching a target figure of 100000 military 
personnel in the region 
the transportation strain has fallen most heavily on the 
pentagons airlift operation johnson said because of the need in 
the earliest stage of desert shield to get as many light infantry 
on the ground in saudi arabia as possible 
he described the air operation as the largest sustained 
airlift ever over a short period of time 
besides the workhorse c141 and c5 military transport planes 
used to ferry men and equipment johnson said the pentagon has 
relied heavily on the commercial airline industry several airlines 
volunteered to provide charter passenger service he said but late 
last week the pentagon decided to commandeer 38 civilian cargo and 
passenger jets because the volunteer pool was too small 
johnson said he didnt expect to force additional commercial 
planes into service 
johnson also acknowledged that the urgent nature of the 
deployments was forcing the pentagon to put off certain safety 
inspections of the c141 fleet which has been plagued by 
structural cracks in some planes 
were taking some risk by pressing the full fleet into 
service before completing the safety review he said 
the general said the overall air and sea transportation effort 
had gone well aided in part by more than 4200 military reservists 
who had volunteered to come on active duty 
johnson told of one man who called to volunteer for duty aboard 
a merchant ship for the 10000 mile trip to saudi arabia but that 
he was a little concerned about his insurance and a few other 
little details the man was 81 years old 
we didnt call on him this time but he was ready to go 
johnson said 
the latest additions to the us military operation in saudi 
arabia include 
an undetermined number of soldiers from the 24th infantry 
division a mechanized unit based at fort stewart ga left from 
hunter army airfield near savannah on tuesday 
the tank landing ship uss manitowac and the amphibious assault 
ship uss iwo jima left port at norfolk va to pick up marines at 
moorehead city nc for the weeklong voyage to the persian gulf

the sharp rise in food stamp recipients shows 
how prevalent poverty is in america a congressional committee on 
hunger says 
at some time everyone is going to have to come to grips with 
the fact that we have this many poor people said rep tony hall 
dohio in a statement released tuesday by his house select 
committee on hunger 
the statement followed published reports about an agriculture 
department study that showed the number of people on food stamps 
rose 1 million between may 1989 and may 1990 to top 20 million for 
the first time in five years 
the agriculture department report had been requested by the 
senate appropriations committee which is still considering how 
much to allow for the food stamp program next year the house has 
approved 181 billion congress appropriated 16 billion for this 
years program 
what is remarkable about the recent growth in participation is 
that there is no consensus about its causes said the agriculture 
department which released a summary of the report this week it 
occurred even though there were no major changes in the food stamp 
program or in the economy at least as measured by the national 
unemployment rate 
hall said however that the findings in the report demonstrate 
how even a slight downturn in the economy can be too much for some 
people throwing them onto public assistance rolls 
the rise extended to 44 states and the district of columbia 
varying in size and timing from state to state nearly half the 
total increase was attributable to a rise in recipients in texas 
california and florida the report said 
the agriculture department investigators said the increases are 
so recent that much of the data traditionally used to analyze food 
stamp trends are not available 
however the study offers several possible reasons for the 
increases 
greater longterm unemployment thats not showing up in 
statistics 
more working poor 
higher food prices 
changes in the distribution of income 
more female heads of household 
changes in the immigration laws giving thousands of aliens 
legal status and making them eligible for food stamps 
improved accessibility and outreach 
the 1990 farm bill approved by the house earlier this month 
would make even more people eligible than current law with 
provisions designed to help children the nearhomeless and 
homeless the elderly disabled and rural americans who 
traditionally have not had as much access to the food assistance 
program

a prominent medical journal broke the rules of 
scientific impartiality by printing an article assuring the safety 
of a synthetic hormone that boosts cow milk production says the 
head of a foundation that is critical of genetic engineering 
jeremy rifkin president of the foundation on economic trends 
says todays article in the journal of the american medical 
association was written by two scientists who have worked for a 
leading maker of bovine growth hormone 
the editors of jama are showing a flagrant disregard for 
scientific impartiality by publishing an article written by 
scientists who have been under contract to monsanto rifkin said 
tuesday 
the general accounting office congress investigative arm and 
the inspector generals office of the department of health and 
human services are reviewing the food and drug administrations 
handling of the hormone 
the jama article says fda uses a systematic scientific 
process to ensure that all new products used by dairy farmers are 
safe and has answered all the concerns about the safety of milk 
from cows that have received the hormone 
the authors william daughaday and david barbano noted that the 
fda pronounced the hormone safe in 1985 and could approve its 
commercial use by next year 
but rifkin said protection of the public interests demands 
independent longterm studies to determine the safety of milk from 
cows that have been injected 
bgh has been overwhelmingly rejected by both farmers and 
consumers recent public opinion surveys said rifkin the 
introduction of bdh would devastate the family farm undermine the 
purity of dairy products add billions of dollars to the cost of 
dairy support programs hurt cows and pose potential health 
problems 
wisconsin and minnesota have temporarily barred use of the 
hormone 
however an editorial in jama by an outside researcher concurred 
with daughaday and barbano saying milk produced from cows 
treated with bovine somatotropin is no different from the milk of 
untreated cows 
it is both inappropriate and wrong for specialinterest groups 
to play on the health and safety fears of the public to further 
their own ends said the editorial by charles h grossman an 
immunologist at the department of veterans affairs in cincinnati

health services and educational programs for 
rural americans at high risk of getting aids must be expanded 
dramatically to stem the spread of the disease the national 
commission on aids says 
aids education is virtually nonexistent and desperately 
needed in rural communities the commission said in a report to 
the white house and congressional leaders tuesday 
this absence of information about aids has fanned an epidemic 
of fear and bigotry in rural america where people infected with 
the aids virus fear being found out nearly as much as they fear 
the disease itself the panel said 
physicians and other healthcare professionals across the 
country also must be educated about acquired immune deficiency 
syndrome because too many of them are refusing to treat aids 
patients the commissions report said 
another area of concern to the commission was access to 
experimental drugs which panel members said is extremely limited 
for minorities women and children even those who have no other 
hope 
the 15member commission that advises congress and the white 
house urged swift action on its latest recommendations as it did 
for its recommendations in two previous reports 
were very late in responding to a massive problem but 
getting later makes no sense at all said dr june osborn 
commission chairwoman and dean of the university of michigan school 
of public health 
the 13page report drew from the commissions visits to georgia 
and texas panel members heard from people who had been rejected by 
their church lost their jobs and were evicted from their 
apartments because they were infected with hiv the human 
immunodeficiency virus that causes aids 
ignorance and misinformation are seriously hampering if not 
crippling efforts to treat rural americans with hiv infection and 
aids the report said 
aids is a more severe problem in the cities but the epidemic is 
growing faster in rural areas cases of the disease rose 37 percent 
in rural areas compared with 5 percent in metropolitan areas with 
more than half a million people from 1988 to 1989 the report said 
the commission recognized recent federal efforts to include more 
blacks and hispanics in governmentfunded testing of experimental 
drugs but said we can and must do better 
blacks and hispanics account for 43 percent of all aids cases 
but they make up only 23 percent of clinical trial participants 
the report said 
children and women of childbearing age usually have been 
excluded from clinical trials but the panel said that must change 
the report also said the national institutes of health had moved 
too slowly to find drugs to manage opportunistic infections which 
are the cause of death for most aids patients the panel said nih 
should give that research a higher priority while continuing work 
on drugs that act on the aids virus 
turning to healthcare personnel the commission said it heard 
repeatedly about a serious shortage of dentists willing to treat 
people with hiv infection and aids 
the report related the experiences of one witness who said the 
only two dentists in his community who would accept medicaid 
declined to see him because he was infected with hiv 
one dentists excuse was that his office was carpeted and he 
would not be able to sterilize the room after the visit the other 
dentist said she had plants and could not take the risk of him 
infecting her plants and her plants then infecting her other 
patients the report said 
the commission also recommended creation of a comprehensive 
communitybased primary health care system supported by adequate 
funding and reimbursement rates such a system is essential for 
the care and treatment of all people not just those with aids 
the panel said 
however the panel did not outline the specifics of such a 
system

nearly three weeks after iraqs invasion 
of kuwait the first signs are showing of a gathering economic

to the persian gulf states who are major purchases of tea its 
principal foreign exchange earner 
scores of oilpoor and cashstrapped nations face inflation 
slower growth and increased debt after iraq invaded kuwait causing 
crude prices to rise from about 20 a barrel to more than 25 
the worst hit are the smaller and poorer nations of the world 
for whom increasing oil prices and un sanctions on trade with 
iraq and kuwait will drastically disrupt their already tenuous 
balance of payments 
manpowerexporting countries ranging from the philippines to

bhatty a member of an economic think tank in new delhi oil is a 
product which has the most linkages with the rest of the economy 
many of these nations have little or no capacity for refining 
crude oil so they were ready buyers of petroleum products from 
kuwait which had the most advanced refineries in the gulf

figures for july show the government heading 
toward a possible new record deficit 
the 1891 billion deficit so far during the first 10 months of 
fiscal 1990 already surpassed the entire 1521 billion imbalance 
piled up during the previous year the treasury department said 
tuesday 
and it has only 32 billion to go in the next two months to beat 
the 2211 billion record set in 1986 it is already 529 percent 
above the 1237 billion deficit compiled at the end of the first 
10 months of 1989 
the white house office of management and budget in july forecast 
a 2185 billion deficit when the current fiscal year ends sept 30 
louis crandall an economist with rh wrightson amp associates in 
new york said that much of the concern over the deficit trend 
this year has been because of weakness in receipts 
however he noted that revenues in july totaled 724 billion 
up 93 percent from the comparable month last year and said that 
doesnt seem to be getting worse 
nevertheless while individual tax revenues rose corporate tax 
revenues dropped illustrating the weak economy 
and the overall receipts were more than offset by spending which 
rose 164 percent to 983 billion 
the outlays included 32 billion by the resolution trust corp 
the government agency charged with bailing out the savings and loan 
industry the sampl bailout cost 158 billion in june and 352 
billion so far this year 
the government expects to regain much of the bailout cost by 
selling real estate loans securities and other assets from failed 
thrifts that the government says will help reduce the deficit in 
future years 
in addition to spending on the thrift bailout economist 
crandall noted other very strong spending in many categories 
particularly medicare and medicaid 
spending by the health finance administration which administers 
both programs was 25 percent higher in july than a year ago 
crandall said 
revenues for the first 10 months of fiscal 1990 totaled 8501 
billion up 43 percent from the same period of 1989 but spending 
totaled 104 trillion a 107 percent increase over the first 10 
months of last year 
the biggest spending categories as usual were the military 
social security and other programs of the department of health and 
human services and interest on the national debt 
military spending totaled 22 billion in july and 2414 so far 
this year it is projected to total 2902 billion for the entire 
fiscal year 
social security payments amounted to 196 billion for the month 
and 2031 billion for the year so far they are projected to total 
2449 billion for the year 
other hhs payments including medicare and medicaid totaled 
173 billion during july and 1614 billion thus far this year 
they are projected to total 1924 billion in fiscal 1990 
interest on the national debt amounted to 184 billion for the 
month and 2286 billion so far this year it is projected to total 
2611 billion for the entire year

jesse jackson says he wants to go to iraq as a 
journalist rather than diplomat but still thinks he can help ease 
tensions by interviewing officials and americans held hostage in 
that country 
it would not be appropriate to go there as a diplomat the 
former democratic presidential contender turned televisionshow 
host told reporters tuesday assuming such a role would interfere 
with what is a growing crisis he said 
but jackson who traveled to syria in 1984 to negotiate the 
release of a navy pilot shot down over syria said journalistic 
communications could encourage a diplomatic solution to the middle 
east crisis 
we are not certain just yet as to what our governments plans 
are for that area jackson said if on the one hand it is 
military deterrence and diplomatic initiatives then communications 
could facilitate a level of dialogue that appears to be closing 
the jesse jackson show is scheduled to begin next month 
syndicated by timewarner inc which jackson said would help 
underwrite the trip the staff of the new show is trying to make 
arrangements for the trip he said 
but he added in an interview later with wttgtv that pressure 
has been applied by the administration to discourage the trip and 
its unfortunate and it is inconsistent 
the white house and the state department denied any effort to 
discourage jackson from traveling

president bush is still in maine at 
the midpoint of his 25day holiday mixing golf with the gulf in a 
vacation marred by the biggest us military operation since the 
vietnam war 
what you dont want to do is appear to be held hostage in the 
white house to events bush told reporters as he headed off to 
his summer home 12 days ago 
but it appears theres a price to be paid for not being a 
hostage too 
at a time when young soldiers are sweltering in newly dug 
foxholes in the saudi desert gas masks attached to their garrison 
belts the president has been pictured almost daily out golfing at 
breakneck pace or chasing bluefish in the atlantic in his beloved 
cigarette boat fidelity 
polls show the public overwhelmingly backs bushs stand in 
defense of saudi arabia and by lesser margins the public supports 
his taking a vacation too 
but bush may be laying himself open to partisan attack at a 
later date with the maladroit way the white house has projected his 
image on several occasions in the past two weeks 
as democratic political consultant bob squier put it if i 
ever need it i now have a shot of bush climbing into a hot boat 
and wasting gas on the day he sent american boys to risk their 
lives for more wasted gas 
the crisis has clearly made heavy demands upon the presidents 
time at walkers point the scenic family refuge on maines rocky 
coast 
twice he has jetted back to washington he has delivered 
speeches at the pentagon and before the veterans of foreign wars 
he opened his door to jordans king hussein and saudi arabias 
prince saud and he has kept the phone lines ringing at other 
capitals 
republican pollster and white house adviser robert teeter said a 
poll that he and democrat peter hart conducted for the wall street 
journal and nbc found the public supporting bushs decision to stay 
on vacation by a 53 percent to 39 percent margin the same survey 
found overwhelming support for bushs handling of the gulf crisis 
72 to 16 percent 
teeter in an interview from ann arbor mich called the 
questions raised about bushs staying in kennebunkport purely a 
story created by the press 
ultimately what counts is how he handles the crisis and 
what the results are this we will all forget said teeter 
stephen hess of the brookings institution says the media are 
giving a false impression of how the presidency works 
its a question of image versus reality said hess a white 
house adviser in past administrations the reality is the 
presidency goes where the president is logistically they are 
perfectly supplied wherever they are and kennebunkport is not 
exactly nome alaska 
norm ornstein a resident scholar at the american enterprise 
institute said i do not think its a bad idea to send 
indirectly to saddam hussein the message that if were in a long 
war of nerves bush is not panicking hes going about business as 
usual 
and bush may be better off facing this crisis in the 
psychologically mellow surroundings of his summer home with 
wife and family rather than back in the white house grumbling and 
puttering around alone ornstein said 
but ornstein said he is puzzled by the political 
tonedeafness of bushs sojourn in kennebunkport 
every day there are pictures and sound bites of him responding 
to events in the gulf all showing him on the golf course getting 
out of the boat jogging and i dont think thats a particularly 
good image for him to be putting out he said 
it may not matter much at a time when americans have rallied 
around our commander in chief and rallied around the flag said 
ornstein but if something goes wrong his recreating is going 
to be a major piece of the attack against him

figures for july show the government heading 
toward a possible new record deficit 
the 1891 billion deficit so far during the first 10 months of 
fiscal 1990 already surpassed the entire 1521 billion imbalance 
piled up during the previous year the treasury department said 
tuesday 
and it has only 32 billion to go in the next two months to beat 
the 2211 billion record set in 1986 it is already 529 percent 
above the 1237 billion deficit compiled at the end of the first 
10 months of 1989 
the white house office of management and budget in july forecast 
a 2185 billion deficit when the current fiscal year ends sept 30 
louis crandall an economist with rh wrightson amp associates in 
new york said that much of the concern over the deficit trend 
this year has been because of weakness in receipts 
however he noted that revenues in july totaled 724 billion 
up 93 percent from the comparable month last year and said that 
doesnt seem to be getting worse 
nevertheless while individual tax revenues rose corporate tax 
revenues dropped illustrating the weak economy 
and the overall receipts were more than offset by spending which 
rose 164 percent to 983 billion 
the outlays included 32 billion by the resolution trust corp 
the government agency charged with bailing out the savings and loan 
industry the sampl bailout cost 158 billion in june and 352 
billion so far this year 
the government expects to regain much of the bailout cost by 
selling real estate loans securities and other assets from failed 
thrifts that the government says will help reduce the deficit in 
future years 
in addition to spending on the thrift bailout economist 
crandall noted other very strong spending in many categories 
particularly medicare and medicaid 
spending by the health finance administration which administers 
both programs was 25 percent higher in july than a year ago 
crandall said 
revenues for the first 10 months of fiscal 1990 totaled 8501 
billion up 43 percent from the same period of 1989 but spending 
totaled 104 trillion a 107 percent increase over the first 10 
months of last year 
the biggest spending categories as usual were the military 
social security and other programs of the department of health and 
human services and interest on the national debt 
military spending totaled 22 billion in july and 2414 so far 
this year it is projected to total 2902 billion for the entire 
fiscal year 
social security payments amounted to 196 billion for the month 
and 2031 billion for the year so far they are projected to total 
2449 billion for the year 
other hhs payments including medicare and medicaid totaled 
173 billion during july and 1614 billion thus far this year 
they are projected to total 1924 billion in fiscal 1990 
interest on the national debt amounted to 184 billion for the 
month and 2286 billion so far this year it is projected to total 
2611 billion for the entire year

up another blockade within hours further down the tracks 
the premier of this canadian province bill vander zalm 
condemned the second blockade tuesday called because of a dispute 
over land claims 
i would suggest they are doing harm and they should cease 
desist and avoid the sort of confrontational issues this could lead 
to he said 
earlier tuesday police arrested about 40 indians at seton 
portage for defying a provincial supreme court injunction ordering 
them to end their blockade of british columbia rails main line 
those arrested included three chiefs marvin bob of the 
pavilion band rod louie of seton lake and roger adolph of the 
fountain band all part of the stlatlimx nation the 
stlatlimx unhappy with british columbias response to their land

provincial government with the theft of their land 
those arrested at seton portage were taken to lillooet about 
100 miles northeast of vancouver they were to be released on their 
own recognizance after being charged with disobeying a court order 
authorities said 
when the first blockade was removed two freight trains bound 
for prince george continued a journey stalled since friday when 
the blockade began 
but before a southbound train had gone far indians from the 
lillooet peoples movement blocked the line on indian land near 
mount currie about 60 miles southwest of seton portage said ray 
pierre manager of the mount currie indian band 
pierre said the line will be blocked for at least 24 hours 
the bc rail line runs between vancouver and prince george the 
railroad said it was losing more than 635000 a day because of the 
blockade bc rail obtained the supreme court injunction saturday 
the blockade also was in support mohawks in oka quebec who 
have been in an armed standoff with police and the armed forces 
since july 11 
the dispute arose over the oka communitys plans to expand a 
golf course onto what the mohawks said was ancestral land a police 
attempt to remove a mohawk barricade led to the shooting death of 
an officer but responsibility in the death remains to be 
established 
karistanoran a mohawk spokesman said proposals now call for

destroying doors and windows of the mcdonalds another hamburger 
stand and a passing taxi police said 
no one immediately claimed responsibility for the latest 
attacks lt col pablo bernabe police chief of suburban 
valenzuela blamed rebel soldiers for the bombings 
we are inclined to believe that this was the handiwork of 
ultrarightists who are sowing fear among our people to destabilize 
our democratic government bernabe said 
the mcdonalds bombing was the latest attack since dissident 
rightwing soldiers bombed buildings of the department of trade and 
industry on aug 13 and the third since late tuesday 
a bomb shattered glass windows of a private investment building 
in the binondo district tuesday night this was followed about

two astronomers say they have discovered 
evidence that may keep abraham lincolns reputation as honest 
abe intact 
they say lincoln as a lawyer before he became president played 
fair 133 years ago when he got a murder suspect off the hook by 
discrediting a witness who said he saw the crime by the light of a 
bright threequartersfull moon 
lincoln produced an almanac that indicated the moon was setting 
and near the horizon at 11 pm on aug 29 1857 when duff 
armstrong supposedly bludgeoned a man to death after a religious 
camp meeting in illinois armstrong was acquitted 
but townspeople remembered there was indeed a full bright moon 
at the camp meeting that night some suspected lincoln of producing 
a phony almanac 
now it appears that both lincoln and the townspeoples memories 
were correct said astronomers donald olson and russell doescher of 
southwest texas state university in san marcos 
using computers to recreate the sky above central illinois on 
the night of the murder the astronomers found that what occurred 
was an unusual lunar phenomenon that caused the moon to move 
quickly from its highest point in the sky to setting 
the moon on that night was 74 percent full and near a position 
it reaches only once every 186 years in which its arc is at its 
lowest in the sky as seen by people in the northern hemisphere 
the astronomers calculate that just before 8 pm during the 
camp meeting the moon was due south and at its highest point for 
the night but by 11 pm the moon was already dropping from view 
near the southwestern horizon 
coincidentally there will be a somewhat similar event on this 
years anniversary of the slaying olson said the moon will be 
about threequarters full and low in the sky although not in as 
extreme a southern declination as it was the last time the 
186year cycle came around in early 1987 
olson said it took about six months of research and combing 
through libraries in five states to collect the data needed to 
recreate the sky 
this is really fun to blend astronomy with something else 
he said weve made a small contribution to this episode the 
books on lincoln are a little bit confusing on this 
he got the idea to investigate the almanac trial mystery 
when he saw a photograph last year of norman rockwells painting of 
lincoln in court 
being an astronomer this interested me he said i 
thought what the heck is he doing with that almanac

a fourth round of talks to end el 
salvadors bloody civil war has deadlocked with a new wave of 
leftist guerrilla attacks on government troops 
both sides said they were pessimistic about reaching any 
agreement before five days of talks were scheduled to wrap up 
today the government rejects rebel demands to dismantle the army 
and punish officers for alleged human rights abuses during a 
10yearold war that has killed 73000 people 
tomorrow the meeting will end and there will be no agreement 
on the issue of the armed forces rebel negotiator salvador 
samayoa told a news conference late tuesday 
samayoa accused president alfredo cristianis rightist 
government of failing to make any move whatever to get closer 
to the rebel position demanding that both the army and the 
guerrillas be dismantled 
it could be said that we are stuck justice minister oscar 
santamaria who heads the usbacked governments negotiating 
team said even before tuesdays session began 
he criticized the rebels for the attacks monday and tuesday that 
killed 11 people and wounded 12 a san salvador army barracks 
across the street from cristianis residence was among the targets 
the state department said rebel violence during the talks raised 
doubts about the rebels willingness to negotiate 
the guerrillas should immediately cease these attacks and 
negotiate seriously to end the war said the departments deputy 
spokesman richard boucher said tuesday in washington 
mediator alvaro de soto a personal representative of un 
secretarygeneral javier perez de cuellar said it also was 
unlikely that agreement could be reached on a ceasefire sept 15 
as originally planned 
he said the negotiations will continue as scheduled every month 
but added that given the dynamics of the process its 
impossible to arrive at a negotiated ceasefire agreement before 
sept 15 
representatives for the two sides had set the sept 15 deadline 
for a ceasefire at their first round of talks earlier this year 
and both had expressed optimism this could be done when the round 
opened friday 
cristiani has said the size of the army was open to discussion 
and talking about a purge of officers responsible for human rights 
abuses should come after a ceasefire but he says abolishing the 
army was out of the question because it is unconstitutional 
more than 73000 people have been killed in the civil war most 
of them civilians

president vaclav havel marking 
the first free commemoration of the 1968 warsaw pact invasion told 
100000 czechoslovaks that they must finish toppling the 
burdensome heritage of communist rule 
the huge crowd on tuesday overflowed wenceslas square in 
downtown prague the site of confrontations 22 years ago between 
soviet tanks and weeping angry czechoslovaks who pelted them with 
rocks and garbage 
the aug 21 1968 military intervention crushed the prague 
spring reform movement that tried to introduce communism with a 
human face 
havel the dissident playwright catapulted to the presidency by 
novembers peaceful democratic upheaval cautioned the crowd that 
reform remains unfinished 
it is the burdensome heritage of the totalitarian system that 
we havent yet come to grips with he said in many communities 
huge bureaucratic monsters continue to rule 
but soviet tanks no longer back them he said adding 
we will have only ourselves to blame if we allow them to 
overpower us it is necessary for all the people to put their noses 
to the grindstone weve lost 20 years and we cannot afford to 
lose another single day 
havels comments concentrated on the future blasting what he 
called the communist legacy inefficiency corruption and 
dilettantism that he said threatened czechoslovakias budding 
democracy 
tuesdays observances marked the first free commemoration of the 
invasion anniversary 
last year before czechoslovakias hardline communist leaders 
were ousted riot police waded into thousands of people who 
gathered in wenceslas square to remember the sovietled invasion 
and to demand reform 
the official ctk news agency estimated the crowd filling 
wenceslas square on tuesday at 100000 
it was believed to be the largest gathering there since 
novembers revolution when hundreds of thousands of czechoslovaks 
crowded the square repeatedly to press their demands for 
democratization 
those demonstrations culminated in the toppling of communist 
rule and led to democratic elections in june in which havels czech 
civic forum political movement and its slovak counterpart public 
against violence won a parliamentary majority 
alexander dubcek the reformist communist party leader who 
spearheaded the prague spring movement also addressed the crowd 
dubcek who emerged from years in oblivion to become speaker of 
the freely elected parliament was greeted with chants of long 
live dubcek as he spoke 
bulgarias premier andrei lukanov told state tv as a nation 
and as a party we must be ashamed of ourselves for taking part in 
the events in czechoslovakia in 1968 
the soviet union and warsaw pact allies who participated in the 
invasion now condemn it 
although a normal working day much of tuesday was given over to 
observing the invasions 22nd anniversary 
at daybreak costumed members of the jester society student 
group swarmed through subway stations in a mock invasion of the 
city 
also tuesday mayor jaroslav koran made seven soviets honorary 
citizens of prague the seven were arrested after they staged a 
demonstration in moscow protesting the invasion shortly after 
warsaw pact troops moved into czechoslovakia 
koran also formally stripped the honorary citizenship of soviet 
dictator josef stalin klement gottwald czechoslovakias first 
communist president and gustav husak the communist party leader 
installed by moscow after the invasion

engineers lost radio contact with the 
magellan spacecraft tuesday night for the second time in five days 
nasa said 
scientists werent immediately sure if the spacecrafts computer 
circuits would send out a radio beam in an attempt to reestablish 
communication with earth as the venusorbiting craft is supposed 
to do in an emergency nasa said 
magellans mission is to map up to 90 percent of venus surface 
using radar to peer through the planets thick clouds which 
prevent the use of optical cameras the spacecraft went into orbit 
around venus aug 10 after a roundabout 948millionmile trip it 
was launched from the shuttle atlantis 15 months ago 
they lost it at 703 pm pdt while tracking the craft with 
a nasa antenna dish near canberra australia said jim doyle 
spokesman for nasas jet propulsion laboratory 
the mishap came only hours after nasa released the spacecrafts 
first pictures of earths closest planetary neighbor they showed 
venus has quake faults lava flows like those in hawaii and idaho 
and long parallel valleys and ridges similar to those between the 
sierra nevada and the rockies 
the loss of magellan the centerpiece of a 744 million mission 
to explore venus would be a major blow to nasa which grounded the 
shuttle fleet temporarily because of fuel leaks and found the 
hubble space telescope had a flawed mirror 
doyle said that if the craft was beaming radio waves across the 
sky while spinning as it is supposed to do to in an emergency 
engineers could reestablish intermittent contact between 1203 and 
1230 am pdt wednesday 
less than seven hours before contact broke off project manager 
tony spear said that as far as engineers could tell the 
spacecraft is healthy despite a loss of contact for more than 14 
hours starting last thursday night 
the spacecrafts automatic selfprotection system made magellan 
reestablish with nasa engineers last friday morning then they 
sent magellan a command to make it stop spinning and stay in touch 
with earth 
engineers said they still havent figured out why they lost 
contact with magellan last week 
one leading theory is that a cosmic ray or a highenergy 
particle from the sun caused a blip in magellans computer memory 
said spacecraft system engineer john slonski 
were not ruling out a software flaw or some hardware 
problem or perhaps some unknown electrical fields surrounding 
venus spear said 
cosmic ray hits on spacecraft electronics can be expected to 
interfere with magellan about once each year spear said similar 
events occasionally have disrupted the pioneer venus orbiter 
launched in 1978 and the tracking and data relay satellites in 
earth orbit slonski said 
the pictures released tuesday were taken during an aug 16 test 
when magellan bounced its radar beam off venus for the first time 
as promised by nasa the pictures are 10 times more detailed 
than the best radar images of venus made by the soviet venera 15 
and 16 spacecraft and by the radio telescope at arecibo puerto 
rico they show details as small as 400 feet across or a third 
bigger than the length of a football field 
the large number of fractures and venusquake faults seen in 
images from the spacecraft suggest the crustal movements that 
shaped the landscape are perhaps even more violent than i 
imagined before said steve saunders magellans chief scientist 
at jet propulsion laboratory 
overlapping lava flows of various ages and six to 10 miles 
wide appear as bright and dark splotches he said 
but saunders said the pictures dont yet show any of venus 
major volcanoes whether any of them are active or if the planets 
crust is broken into the kind of drifting plates that carry whole 
continents across the face of the earth previous spacecraft 
revealed numerous mountainous volcanoes 
the lava flows are similar geologically to volcanic deposits 
seen on earth at hawaii and the snake river plains in idaho nasa 
said in a statement 
the parallel sets of elongated valleys and ridges resemble those 
in the basinandrange province of the intermountain region of utah 
and nevada or at the great rift valley in eastern africa they 
show that at least part of venus crust has been stretched apart 
saunders said

a japanese brewer pressured by a petition drive 
says it will revamp a beer hall modeled after the stadium hitler 
built to host the 1936 olympics 
suntory ltd made the announcement tuesday four days after 
receiving a petition signed by more than 60 people objecting to the 
fascist motif of malts stadium 
the beer hall opened three months ago in the chic aoyama 
district of tokyo it was modeled after the berlin stadium that 
adolf hitler intended to be a showcase for what he considered 
german superiority during the 1936 summer games 
four imposing columns line the front of the restaurant the 
entrance is flanked by two statues made of styrofoam and the roof 
is decorated with a horsedrawn chariot statues of athletes dangle 
from the ceiling inside 
there are no swastikas 
geraldine harcourt a translator from new zealand and american 
freelance writer leza lowitz organized the petition which 
received support from japanese as well as foreigners it demanded 
the immediate removal of decor that symbolizes the era of nazism 
which brought about the death of over 6 million people 
suntory is very insensitive to use an image of the berlin 
olympics which was the showcase of hitler ms harcourt said 
there are other possible designs suntory could have copied 
ms harcourt had earlier complained about the restaurants 
showing of a documentary on the 1936 olympics that included shots 
of hitler suntory stopped showing the film 
suntory clearly was taken aback by the criticism 
we had never thought about the connection between the berlin 
olympics and the nazis said company spokesman masashide kanzaki 
hiroko uchimi a spokeswoman for the public relations firm 
representing the bar said the idea was to introduce architecture 
with a masculine image and to emphasize it with a sense of 
aggressiveness in sports 
sports is the theme of the restaurant 
we never had any complaints from other customers here she 
said 
suntory officials met with the two petitioners and agreed to 
change the exterior to remove the offending design kanzaki said 
he said the company would publicly admit that we were ignorant 
of such historic issues and that we offended people 
ms harcourt said she was pleased by suntorys response 
the restaurant was packed monday night and it appeared most of 
the customers were oblivious to the controversy 
haruhiko sato a 44yearold interior designer drinking beer 
with a colleague said he did not connect the entrance with nazi 
germany 
we dont know much about nazi history but it has very little 
to do with us japanese especially today when we enjoy peace he 
said 
takashi saito a professor of international politics at tokyos 
gakushuin university who specializes in nazi history said japanese 
generally are less sensitive about the horrors of nazism than 
westerners 
the younger generation especially tends to be oblivious of the 
issue he said 
japan is not the only asian nation where the commercial use of 
nazi imagery has stirred controversy 
in may 1988 a nazi bar featuring caricatures of hitler and 
photos of storm troopers opened in bangkok thailand waiters wore 
swastikaemblazoned arm bands 
the owner said he picked the nazi theme because of its 
powerful catchy and emotive appeal but complaints prompted 
the bar to change its name after about a month the decor also was 
changed 
nazi symbols also have been a hit in japan a tokyo fad a few 
years ago was collecting items bearing the swastika and other nazi 
symbols

more than two dozen groups are challenging in 
court a nuclear regulatory commission decision to ease controls on 
the disposal of lowlevel nuclear wastes 
the lawsuit filed in the us court of appeals here tuesday 
says the new policy means unhealthy levels of radiation could be 
left in the soil and buildings at closed nuclear power plants and 
that radioactive contamination could drift into the ground water at 
garbage dumps 
it also alleges the nrc did not provide for adequate public 
participation before issuing the new policy in june 
the nrcs rule trades off peoples lives in favor of the 
financial interests of the nuclear industry said joan claybrook 
president of public citizen one of the groups that filed the 
lawsuit 
the nrc said it would on a casebycase basis deregulate the 
disposal of certain lowlevel atomic wastes from nuclear power 
plants hospitals laboratories and other facilities if the 
radioactive emissions are considered below regulatory concern 
other groups joining the lawsuit were the us public interest 
research group the natural resources defense council the nuclear 
information and resource service and physicians for social

a government report showing a sharp rise in 
the number of food stamp recipients demonstrates there are more 
poor people in the united states than many wish to admit says rep 
tony hall dohio 
it shows you to a certain extent the sleeping giant that is 
out there hall said tuesday in a statement released in response 
to published reports of an agriculture department study on food 
stamps 
he said the findings in the report demonstrate how even a slight 
downturn in the economy can be too much for some people throwing 
them onto public assistance rolls 
the report a summary of which was furnished by the agriculture 
department on tuesday said the number of people using food stamps 
rose by more than 1 million between the second quarter of fiscal 
1989 and the second quarter of this fiscal year 
the rise extended to 44 states and the district of columbia 
varying in size and timing from state to state nearly half the 
total increase was attributable to a rise in recipients in texas 
california and florida the report said

since 1977 for having sex with a 13yearold girl can send a 
lawyer to defend himself against a lawsuit filed by the victim a 
state appeals court ruled

with a minor at the home of actor jack nicholson he fled before 
being sentenced and now lives in paris 
the unidentified victim sued in 1988 for damages for physical

boys are just as likely as girls to have 
reading disabilities but are more likely to be diagnosed by 
teachers as having the handicap because of their rambunctiousness 
says a study published today 
the very commonly held notion that there are more reading 
disabled boys than girls is really not an accurate one said dr 
sally e shaywitz an associate professor of pediatrics at the yale 
school of medicine 
more boys than girls wind up in special education classes 
apparently because of the longheld and mistaken belief that 
overactivity and other behavior problems go hand in hand with the 
learning problem the study said 
the result has been that some boys who typically are more 
rambuctious than girls are wrongly being labeled reading 
disabled shaywitz said 
at the same time some girls and some boys are not receiving 
the help they need because they show no behavior problems shaywitz 
said 
shaywitz and her fellow researchers followed more than 400 
children from 12 towns in connecticut from kindergarten through the 
third grade the findings were reported in todays journal of the 
american medical association 
tests showed that roughly the same number of boys as girls had a 
reading disability but two to four times as many boys were placed 
in special reading classes 
dr james kavanagh deputy director for the center for research 
for mothers and children in bethesda md welcomed the study but 
said more work is needed 
its done carefully and it makes good sense he said our 
conventional wisdom has always said that boys have more of these 
problems 
about 2 million children in the united states are designated as 
learning disabled most are found to have a reading disability 
defined as a reading problem that cant be explained by a students 
intellectual ability she said 
students with dyslexia for example often reverse their letters 
or have trouble with their memory or visual perception that makes 
reading difficult children with dyslexia can be taught to read 
when their disorder is recognized 
the study found a possible explanation for the mislabeling in 
the way teachers view the behavior of boys and girls 
children who were identified by their schools as reading 
disabled but who did not meet the researchers criteria were 
significantly more likely to show behavior problems conversely 
children who needed special reading help but were well behaved 
tended to be overlooked by the system the study found 
the schools identified 27 of 198 secondgrade boys and seven of 
216 secondgrade girls as reading disabled by the third grade 20 
of 199 boys were labeled reading disabled by their schools 
compared to nine of 215 girls 
meanwhile the researchers found 13 or 45 percent of the 
thirdgraders receiving special education didnt have a reading 
disability after all 
by putting the wrong labels on the wrong individuals people 
are not getting quite the right services they need shaywitz said 
shaywitz said her study shows that doctors should not rely soley 
on schools to identify children with learning disabilities

georgias parole board says it commuted a 
killers sentence to life in prison one day before he was to be 
executed because he never was tried by a jury and because relatives 
of the victim had pleaded for mercy 
william neal moore 39 received the commuted sentence tuesday 
hours after he had won a 30day stay of execution from the us 
supreme court 
moore who had been scheduled to die today in the electric 
chair will be eligible for parole in nine years after he has 
served 25 years 
the boards unanimous decision stemmed largely from the fact 
that no jury ever weighed moores fate said board chairman wayne 
snow jr 
but he said were not suggesting there would be any 
difference in what the jury would decide 
moore had pleaded guilty to murder in 1974 but a judge 
sentenced him to die anyway a decision that would have rested with 
a jury had moore gone to trial 
the board also received messages on moores behalf from mother 
teresa and jesse jackson several nieces and cousins of the victim 
appeared at tuesdays board meeting testifying on behalf of the 
bornagain christian a family spokesman said relatives of the 
victim were very positive and forgiving of moore 
to say the least the board was much impressed by the fact 
that we did have family of the victim who asked for clemency 
thats not something we often see said snow 
he also said the board was impressed by moores good prison 
record but wasnt moved by his jailhouse conversion we hear 
that all the time 
it was the third time the board has commuted the death sentence 
of a georgia deathrow inmate since capital punishment was 
reinstated in 1976 
the other cases involved conspirators who had been sentenced to 
death when the actual killer got life in prison 
moore was convicted of killing fredger stapleton 74 in 1974 a 
friend had told moore a depressed 23yearold soldier from fort 
gordon that stapleton kept 20000 in his home according to 
testimony moore got drunk and stapleton fired at him when he 
entered the home moore shot back killing the man 
the columbus ohio native said he joined the army as a 
teenager compiled a spotless record and was weighing a military 
career when his wife his childhood sweetheart soured on military 
life and left him taking their 2yearold son

chinas senior leader deng xiaoping turned 86 
today but there was no public observance of his birthday in the 
capital 
deng who is reported to suffer from cancer has retired from 
all his communist party and government posts but still has final 
say over policy and important decisions 
dengs last public appearance was july 3 when he toured the 
asian games village and visited beijings tallest skyscraper 
reports said he walked unaided up the 28 steps to a platform on a 
track and field course and declined a seat during the elevator ride 
up the skyscraper 
he is believed to be vacationing at beidaihe the seaside resort 
to which he and other leaders retire every august 
last year newspapers marked dengs birthday by trumpeting the 
publication of a new collection of his speeches that announcement 
followed months of publicity that seemed to signal an emerging 
personality cult after the june 1989 crackdown on prodemocracy 
protesters

an actors union decision to let a white man 
play a eurasian pimp in miss saigon wasnt enough for its 
producer who says the hit london musical wont see broadway unless 
hes free to cast other roles 
cameron mackintoshs decision could cost him 600000 already 
spent and 25 million in advance ticket sales but he said tuesday 
the principle comes first 
i cannot in good conscience reschedule the production in the 
absence of a positive working environment and an understanding 
that artistic freedom of choice cannot be compromised mackintosh 
said in a statement 
mackintosh said he was willing to work out differences with the 
union actors equity and had sent a letter spelling out his 
worries 
equity had no comment on mackintoshs decision 
the union aug 7 had barred jonathan pryce from recreating his 
awardwinning role when the show comes to broadway in march 
mackintosh then canceled the show under pressure from its members 
the union reversed itself thursday 
a rapproachment could bring miss saigon to broadway in 
april the show stands to become the most expensive broadway 
production ever 
the show has a cast of 50 including 34 roles for minorities 
the pryce role is the only one in the cast that has been announced 
the musical is a love story about an american soldier in vietnam 
during the final days of the war in 1975 
equity representing 37500 members initially said it couldnt 
appear to condone the casting of a caucasian in the role of a 
eurasian 
mackintosh said equitys reversal last week was insufficient 
evidence that the union had a change of heart 
in explaining its reversal the union said pryce could come to 
broadway because he was a star actors equity has veto power 
over foreign actors in the united states but usually does not 
interfere with those deemed stars 
their decision was made solely on the technical basis of mr 
pryces acknowledged star status mackintosh said as i have 
repeatedly stated it is also essential that the profoundly 
unpleasant atmosphere currently surrounding the production be 
dispelled 
pryce won a 1977 tony for his work in comedians and won the 
olivier award the london equivalent of the tony for his portrayal 
of the brothel owner in miss saigon 
asianamerican groups had urged equity to stand firm against 
pryce citing the dearth of good roles for minority actors

a mob informant whose recordings led to 
charges against 41 people wore a wire to his own initiation 
into the mafia during which he took a blood oath to burn in hell 
if i betray my friends 
state police tuesday arrested 29 people including john riggi 
reputed boss of the decavalcante crime family and the son of 
jailed philadelphianew jersey mob boss nicodemo little nicky 
scarfo more arrests were expected today 
the arrests on charges including racketeering gambling 
bribery and drug trafficking were based on information provided 
by george fresolone an informant in the scarfo organization who is 
now in hiding authorities said 
during the yearlong investigation of the scarfo gambino 
colombo luchese genovese and decavalcante mafia families he 
recorded more than 400 conversations through this summer when he 
was initiated into the scarfo mob 
it is only the second time in history that the secret initiation 
rite has ever been recorded officials said 
during the ceremony in the bronx fresolones trigger finger was 
pricked to draw blood authorities said 
the five initiates then recited an oath may i burn in hell 
if i betray my friends in the family while rubbing out a piece 
of paper set on fire in their palms 
a gun and a knife present at the ceremony signified that members 
live by the gun and die by the gun live by the knife and die by 
the knife authorities said 
the recordings detail how the mafia families cooperated in 
setting up illegal activities and shared profits from bookmaking 
loansharking illegal video machines drug distribution municipal 
corruption union control and violence said col justin dintino 
spokesman for the state police 
although scarfo is serving a 69year federal sentence in 
illinois authorities said their investigation showed he was 
channeling messages to his organization through his son nicodemo 
scarfo jr 25 during prison visits 
the younger scarfos arrest will likely deal the elder scarfo a 
devastating blow dintino said scarfos son was someone that he 
completely trusts and whom he had envisioned as the future boss 
of the crime family dintino said

nasa says it has ruled out the possibility 
that household washers in a measuring device caused the hubble 
space telescopes focusing flaw 
just when we thought we knew were back to square one said 
charles pellerin nasa director of astrophysics its 
frustrating 
nasa investigators had suggested last week that improperly 
installed washers 13 millimeters thick might have caused the 
13millimeter flaw in the mirror which is producing blurred 
images from the orbiting telescope 
but pellerin said tuesday the investigators had only estimated 
the thickness of the washers last week when the washers were 
measured they turned out to be much thinner too thin to have 
caused the mirror flaw he said 
now he said its increasingly possible that the cause of the 
mirror flaw was a mathematical error made in transposing the design 
of the measuring device known as a reflective null corrector from 
the drawing board to the assembly room 
the 15 billion telescope was supposed to provide unprecedented 
views of outer space its 94inch primary mirror was made from 1979 
to 1982 by the perkinelmer corp whose optical division in 
danbury was bought last year by hughes danbury optical systems 
the nasa team visited hughes twice to review data and test 
results 
last thursday the investigators said there was an estimated 13 
millimeter error between the mirror and the field lens of the 
reflective null corrector which guides the grinding and polishing 
of a mirror 
the boards strongest hypothesis was that three washers had 
mistakenly been inserted into a plate that held a lens in place in 
the null corrector they werent certain though that the washers 
were to blame at all 
charles spoelhof a member of the investigative team said the 
board only estimated the washers thickness because they were still 
mounted inside the reflective null corrector and werent accessible 
when the washers were measured a few days ago at hughes they 
were found to be just 75 millimeters thick by precision optical 
standards a huge spacing difference from the estimated 
13millimeter thickness pellerin said

a felon serving on a onceobscure state board is 
holding up confirmation of a judicial nominee who once worked for 
the judge who sent him to prison for assault in 1971 
diane kottmyer a federal prosecutor nominated to the state 
superior court by gov michael s dukakis five months ago was a 
law student when joseph jo jo langone iii was given a sixmonth 
sentence she did not clerk for us district judge andrew caffrey 
until 1974 and had no involvement in the case 
but langone for unexplained reasons holds a grudge against her 
i want to bury her the 73yearold undertaker said its 
a free funeral she would go first class with the motorcycle cops 
and everything 
his opposition to kottmyer 44 who gained a reputation 
prosecuting mobsters and corrupt boston police officers has put 
the eightmember massachusetts governors council on the political 
map 
the council which is elected every four years is a holdover 
from colonial days originally intended to check the power of the 
royal governor today it approves all state expenditures and 
confirms judicial appointees nearly all its actions are routine 
because kottmyer lives in langones district outside boston 
langone must nominate her before the council can decide whether to 
approve her for the judgeship he has so far refused to do so 
langone a member of the council since 1977 initially suspected 
kottmyer had played a role in recommending that he be sent to 
prison for assaulting a drug investigator who had parked his car 
outside langones funeral parlor the investigator had not been 
keeping surveillance on langone 
though he later learned from news reports that kottmyer had 
nothing to do with his conviction langone has still pledged to 
stop her nomination 
kottmyer has refused to comment 
kottmyer helped prosecute reputed mafia figure ilario zannino 
and langone recently sent a letter to a judge asking that zanninos 
30year prison sentence be reduced but he denied his interest in 
the zannino case had anything to do with his opposition to kottmyer 
judicial officials have called on langone to remove himself from 
the nomination process former us attorney william weld a 
gubernatorial candidate has called for the councils abolition 
only in massachusetts would a convicted felon be able to pass 
judgment on the qualifications of a person nominated to the 
bench he said 
caffrey who sentenced langone in 1971 said langone harbored 
a clearly articulated bias against kottmyer and should step 
aside from the nominating process 
council members who need only be a state resident for five 
years to be eligible are up for reelection this year langone a 
democrat will meet two challengers in the sept 18 primary the 
general election is on nov 6 
state law does not prohibit people convicted of a crime from 
holding public office unless they engaged in corruption to gain the 
job 
langones district includes the predominantly italianamerican 
neighborhoods of east boston and affluent suburbs such as lexington

in 1986 and many members were arrested at that time 
police said the group initially called fiery flower was 
reorganized and in 1989 became an underground organization 
police said the group had plans to attack a munitions area where 
weapons were kept for reserve army troops the location of the 
munitions area was not disclosed and the unit the soldiers belonged 
to was not disclosed 
those under arrest tried to instigate antigovernment struggle 
among workers and students on college campuses police said 
police released several names of those arrested but none were 
wellknown radicals 
police said it was hoped other members of the organization would 
disband and no more arrests were expected 
on saturday police said 19 students had been charged with 
violating the nations national security law and another 56 were on 
the fugitive list all were charged in connection with writing 
articles in praise of north korea in campus newspapers and

probationary employees would be released in response to a weakening 
economy and a lull in the airline business 
spokeswoman susan young said the employees were hired as part of 
the planned expansion 
usair flies about 3000 domestic flights daily supported by 
55200 employees 
the cuts are across the board in most departments and in most 
geographic areas of the country young said she said specifics 
were not available but would include all types of employees 
anywhere from airport maintenance workers to secretaries 
we deeply regret that this action is necessary but these 
employees were hired in anticipation of an expansion program that 
has been reduced in light of current economic projections said 
usair president seth e schofield 
young said travel has been flat the nations economy weakening 
and the economic climate for the next 12 to 24 months does not look 
so good

1989 and a 385 million buyout of pacific southwest airlines in 
1987 since then usair has grown rapidly under deregulation and 
still has plans to add new overseas routes

a state newspaper today cautioned europe 
and japan against backing the united states in the persian gulf 
crisis saying their regional interests would be harmed if they 
walk in the steps of washington 
another newspaper warned that iraq would take war into the 
cities of attacking nations and said the soviet union also should 
realize us interests might harm those of moscow 
a third said the united states which has condemned the holding 
of foreign hostages by baghdad is the last country that has a 
right to talk about human rights 
the staterun algomhuriya warned france italy west germany 
and japan not to participate in what it termed american 
occupation of the gulf oilfields 
those nations should know where there interests lie so that 
they dont blindly follow the american schemes designed to seize 
the arab oil wells the daily said in a frontpage editorial 
the daily accused the united states of imposing its hegemony 
on the european countries and japan and trying to control their 
ecnomoies through dominating arab oil resources 
it said europe and japan risked losing longterm economic 
interests in the arab world if they supported the united states 
the newspaper said the europeans and the japanese should deal 
with the new and unified iraq which it described as a 
regional power of wealth and profound history that was a 
reference to iraqs annexation of kuwait which it invaded aug 2 
the united states and several arab nations have sent troops to 
saudi arabia to defend it against possible iraqi attack and 
several nations have joined the us by sending warship to the 
region to help enforce a un embargo on iraqi goods 
the baghdad observer warned that any flareup in the gulf will 
lead to allout war 
one should not expect the iraqis to sit idle when their towns 
and population centers are being bombarded by the us planes and 
shells iraqis will take the war into the cities of the attacking 
nations if it is attacked the paper said 
the us wants to impose hegemony on the region and as they 
put it teach naughty iraq a lesson washington wants governments 
in this part of the region to be weak enough to give in to the 
expansionist demands of israel 
it said the united states appears to believe it can do anything 
it wants with no parties daring to challenge it 
the paper said american military presence in the middle east 
means a defensive line close to the soviet union a line which 
would confront any future soviet attempt to have an influence in 
this vitally strategic area 
alqadissisya the iraqi army newspaper said he who speaks 
about human rights must first have a record book free from crimes 
against humanity 
it said iraqs step to keep foreigners in strategic locations to 
ward off an attack is different from the reality of americas 
black history and its record which is full of crimes against 
humanity and struggle of peoples whose territories were under 
occupation

a black music professor has resigned from 
dartmouth college liberating himself from repeated attacks 
during the past seven years by a conservative offcampus student 
weekly newspaper 
i wish i were leaving under more favorable circumstances 
william cole said in a prepared statement i know that many 
people will feel that the forces which are part of my leaving 
dartmouth have won a major victory however this problem is no 
longer for me to wrestle with it is a problem for dartmouth to 
wrestle with 
faculty dean james wright said cole never sought to be a 
public figure he joined dartmouths faculty to teach write and 
pursue his other professional interests but some would not permit 
this to be 
the dartmouth review targeted cole in what it said was a crusade 
against the decline of higher education once describing him as 
part of dartmouths dynamic duo of mediocrity 
the review began attacking his teaching ability and personality 
in 1983 an article that year called one music course he taught 
the most outrageous gut course on campus the newspaper also 
described him as a lean scruffy fellow who looks like a used 
brillo pad 
cole filed a 600000 libel suit against the paper that was 
settled out of court two years later for no money 
he also had a classroom confrontation with student staff members 
of the review who got a judge to rule they were unfairly suspended 
as a result a federal court threw out the white students 
discrimination claim 
cole said at the time he didnt think dartmouth recognized the 
threat the attacks posed to the institution 
its causing people irrespective of if they are black white 
male or female to think about whether they want to teach here 
he said in 1988 its causing liberalminded students to think 
about whether they want to come here 
my effectiveness as a teacher and participant in the dartmouth 
community was compromised cole said in his statement last week 
by a series of events which began in 1983 
there is a tendency to dwell upon and continue to analyze 
these issues he said for my part the end of my association 
with dartmouth is liberating 
cole said his departure frees him to concentrate on performing 
promoting music of minority artists and participating in 
multidisciplinary artistic events 
cole came to dartmouth in 1974 and taught courses in american 
jazz and the music of nonwestern cultures he has written books on 
jazz artists miles davis and john coltrane he also has performed 
in his own group wind and thunder he was awarded tenure in 1979 
and was promoted to full professor in 1985

even though domestic violence causes more 
injuries to women than auto accidents muggings and rapes combined 
doctors largely ignore the problem says a report in a medical 
journal 
but a spokesman for emergencyroom physicians says the report 
overstates the shortcomings of doctors and fails to show they are 
sometimes hampered by a lack of support services or by womens 
reluctance to implicate batterers 
twentytwo percent to 35 percent of women who visit emergency 
departments have symptoms linked to abuse either physical or 
stressrelated said the report in todays journal of the american 
medical association 
thirtyfour percent of all female homicide victims older than 
15 years are killed by their husbands or intimate partners added 
the report by the journals associate editor teri randall who 
cited fbi data from 1976 to 1987 
while most clinicians wouldnt consider discharging a patient 
with a lifethreatening condition data from emergency department 
records show that a majority of women who are victims of domestic 
abuse are discharged without any arrangements made for their 
safety to return to the same abusive relationships that caused 
their injuries the report said 
the only physicians who ask about violence are psychiatrists 
and theyre only interested if it occurs in a dream they rarely 
ask about the violent events that occur in real life dr mark 
rosenberg director of injury control for the national centers for 
disease control told the journal 
but the report just might be overstated said dr jack 
allison vice president of the american college of emergency 
physicians he said the report fails to convey that many 
communities lack shelters or other services for abused women and 
many women cover up for the wrongdoings of batterers 
in addition there are still times unfortunately when women 
go back to those relationships they choose not to go to shelter 
choose not to press charges choose not to get out of the abusive 
situation thats a real frustration for physicians he said in a 
telephone interview tuesday from greenville nc 
a 1987 study of one urban emergency department indicated 
physicians treating victims deliberately injured by other people 
rarely asked about the victims past sexual or physical abuse 
living arrangements or prospects for safety 
by not asking these questions the physician lost the 
opportunity to address the cause of the patients medical condition 
and closed the door to preventive measures the study concluded 
mildred dailey pagelow a sociology professor at california 
state university fullerton told the journal physicians will 
often say im not a law enforcement officer and im not a social 
worker im here to treat the body and she needs to see a 
psychiatrist 
yet a growing number of physicians think the treatment of 
domestic violence is a medical matter the report said 
quicker than you can put on a bandaid you can acknowledge 
the violence you can assert that this is illegal not her fault 
and that a lot of women are in this situation said dr anne 
flitcraft an assistant professor of medicine at the university of 
connecticut farmington and codirector of the new havenbased 
domestic violence training project 
you can educate her about the communitybased resources 
available to help her and ask her are you safe ms flitcraft 
told the journal 
many hospitals have instituted procedures specifically designed 
to help abused patients the report said 
for example specially designated nurses act as patient 
advocates seeing that abused women receive help from a 
psychiatrist or social worker if appropriate and supplying a 
referral list to shelters legal services and counseling services 
the report said

the parents of eight children who include 
the countrys first testtube quintuplets will receive about 1000 
a month to care for three nieces ending a fourmonth application 
process 
the state department of social service on tuesday licensed the 
home of raymond and michele lesperance for fostercare making the 
davisburg family eligible for more benefits to care for its 
children the decision was announced in oakland county probate 
court where the couple had turned in hopes of getting their 
license application approved quickly 
we are elated said raymond lesperance who had been trying 
since april to get the license 
the lesperances parents of eight children from current and 
previous marriages began caring for the 6 10 and 13yearold 
nieces last year when the girls parents sought drug and alcohol 
rehabilitation the couple was receiving 295 monthly from aid to 
families with dependent children but sought the fostercare 
license to qualify for more government aid 
oakland county probate judge barry grant had pushed the 
department of social services to act quickly 
its disturbing to me what couldve happened if these children 
were not fortunate enough to be wanted by their aunt and uncle 
grant said the system as it presently exists is not addressing 
the needs of children 
the lesperances had quintuplets in 1988 believed to be the 
first conceived in vitro and successfully carried in the united 
states michele lesperance works in a home for battered women her 
husband is a macomb county corrections officer and holds a second 
job in a toolanddie shop

west german chancellor helmut kohl wants east 
germany to dissolve and unite with his country on oct 6 one day 
before east germanys founding as a sovereign nation sources said 
today 
the preference of kohl who has been able to dictate most of the 
pace of unification throws yet another date into the politically 
charged debate over when east germany should unify 
west german government sources speaking on condition of 
anonymity said kohl wants unity to take place one day before the 
41st anniversary of east germanys founding as a communist state on 
oct 7 
the date was proposed by guenter krause prime minister lothar 
de maizieres top aide and the countys leading unification 
official kohl and de maiziere are both christian democrats who 
have been battling with the leftleaning social democrats in both 
countries over the timing of unity 
as late as tuesday de maiziere favored that unity take place on 
oct 14 when elections are held to create the five states that 
east germany will become in a united nation 
however east german social democrat spokesman helga wanke said 
today that her party rejected the oct 6 date she said the party 
was standing firm on its insistence that unity take place on sept 
15 
east germany will unite by approving a clause in the west 
germany constitution that allows former german lands to accede to 
the western nation 
the social democrats say they want unity to come in 
midseptember so that west germany can more quickly assume direct 
responsibility for east germanys failing economy 
joblessness has been climbing since east germany converted to a 
free market on july 1 but the social demcrats also want quick 
unity so kohl they say will be forced to admit the true costs of 
bailing out the east german economy 
both parties are in the midst of a political campaign to lead 
the united nation common german elections are tentatively set for 
dec 2 
an apparent east german agreement to unite on oct 14 fell apart 
tuesday amid namecalling and growing rancor the social democrats 
the nations secondlargest party defied their leader and rejected 
unity on that date 
richard schroeder parliamentary leader of the social democrats 
had agreed to the proposal he quit his post after his party 
decided not to accept it 
the conservative christian democrats hold the most votes in 
parliament and are in the best position to set the date for the 
historic merger 
de maizieres government has suffered a series of dismissals 
resignations and charges of incompetence in the past week on 
sunday the social democrats withdrew from de maizieres governing 
coalition in a dispute over unification 
six ministers have resigned or been ousted from the cabinet in 
the past week the chief of the agency set up to sell east 
germanys ailing enterprises resigned amid criticism of his failure 
to unload the businesses 
kohl wants to keep unity and electons close together he lost a 
bid to have them both held on the same day oct 14 because that 
required rewriting west germanys constitutional timetable to 
elections 
the east german parliament must approve unification by a 
twothirds majority but only a simple majority is needed to set a 
date all the major parties are committed to unification but the 
debate has been reduced to a political brawl over when it should 
take place 
many details remain to be worked out 
fighting between political parties in both germanys essentially 
in the throes of an election campaign will likely resurface 
how to distribute east german property has been a roadblock to a 
political treaty that is to mesh the two countries some of the 
property is claimed by west germans who fled the region after the 
soviet onrush late in world war ii

last week up to 1000 guards blockaded the entrance to the 
island in the east river for 36 hours protesting inmate violence 
against guards and demanding more authority to use force 
the blockade left the jail short of staff and prevented inmates 
from receiving visitors as the blockade was ending aug 14 
hundreds of prisoners rioted in anger and 162 guards and inmates 
were reported injured most of them by tear gas 
during the disturbance officers were accused of lining up some 
inmates and beating them bloody with nightsticks the city is 
investigating the accusations 
the rev irvine bryer a member of the board of correction said 
guards told him they forced prisoners into a corridor and beat them 
while shouting we control the jails not you 
the blockade ended after guards reached an agreement that 
allowed greater leeway in the use of force but a federal judge 
barred the correction department from implementing the new rules 
and ordered a compromise be reached

an iraqi tanker that ignored warning 
shots from an american warship entered the waters off yemens port 
of aden today and dropped anchor near two other iraqi ships already 
anchored there 
shipping sources said a us warship shadowed the tanker baba 
gurgur until it entered yemeni waters the tanker was one of two 
iraqi tankers that refused to stop saturday when us navy frigates 
fired warning shots across their bows 
yemen has told the un security council that it would turn away 
the baba gurgur and adhere to the united nations trade embargo 
imposed on iraq after its aug 2 invasion of kuwait 
yemeni officials would not comment on the tankers today 
however the official yemeni news agency quoted an unidentified 
foreign ministry official on tuesday as saying yemen did not intend 
to intercept or obstruct any ships 
the red sea country could still adhere to un sanctions by 
simply ignoring the tankers and refusing them permission to load 
saudi arabia used a similar ploy to turn away the two other iraqi 
tankers now anchored at aden 
those tankers the alfao and alqadissiyah left their 
anchorage in the red sea off saudi arabia last week when they were 
unable to load crude 
aden port control on tuesday said the two tankers were anchored 
outside the oil terminal in aden a western diplomat said the two 
empty tankers may have sailed to yemen just to tie up in a safe 
port 
the baba gurgur is a 36397ton iraqi products carrier a ship 
designed to pick up finished oil products from a refinery for 
delivery to distribution points elsewhere 
shipping sources said the refinery at aden has not accepted a 
consignment of iraqi crude in more than a month before the crisis 
however iraq sent crude to that refinery it said recently that 
the baba gurgur was en route to aden to pick up fuel oil stored 
there 
the baba gurgur ignored three warning shots fired across its bow 
saturday by the frigate uss bradley in the persian gulf and sailed 
to yemen shadowed by an unidentified american warship 
another iraqi tanker the khanaqin ignored six warning shots 
from the frigate uss reid in the gulf of oman that ship reportedly 
was also sailing toward yemen 
a us military spokesman speaking on condition of anonymity 
said on tuesday that the khanaqin was still under surveillance but 
he refused to disclose the location of the vessel 
shipping sources in yemen confirmed that the baba gurgur was 
anchored off aden but said they also did not know the location of 
the khanaqin 
the tankers arrival in yemen has focused unwanted attention on 
its government which has generally avoided criticism of iraq since 
it invaded kuwait aug 2 and has opposed the multinational force 
defending saudi arabia 
however oil executives in the gulf say yemen needs the revenues 
from its refinery at aden and cannot afford to run the risk of 
drawing international sanctions for breaking the embargo aganist 
iraq 
yemen has been gripped by proiraqi and antius demonstrations 
that included rockthrowing assaults on the american embassy in the 
first days of the persian gulf crisis 
gen ali abdullah saleh president since may in the merged state 
formed of north and south yemen went to washington early this year 
to foster ties with the united states

about 200 jordanian women carying banners 
and singing patriotic songs marced on the us embassy today 
demanding the united states withdraw troops from saudi arabia and 
lift the economic embargo on iraq 
the women who marched from downtown amman in blazing heat were 
stopped by police about 100 yards from the mission for about an 
hour they blocked traffic on a main avenue nearby chanted slogans 
and sang songs 
the women carried large cloth banners reading stop the 
american blockade and jordanian women protest american 
intervention 
other placards said mr bush dont stick your nose in arab 
affairs and american mothers why send your sons to die in the 
arabian desert 
small children held up bunches of flowers and placards that 
read remember the flower children make love not war 
a statement delivered to the us embassy by a delegation of 
women demanded the us troops withdraw from saudi arabia where 
they are stationed to deter a possible iraqi invasion of the 
kingdom 
they also demanded an end to the economic embargo of iraq 
unimposed sanctions were imposed after iraqs aug 2 invasion of 
kuwait and subsequent annexation of the emirate 
the united states is planning to plunge the region into world 
war iii and complete annihiliation the statement said 
riot police wearing helmets and carrying shields and truncheons 
remained seated in a truck opposite the embassys main gate during 
the demonstration 
such protests an almost daily occurrence in jordan reflect the 
predominantly proiraqi feeling of jordanians half of whom are 
either of palestinian origin or from the israelioccupied west bank 
and gaza strip 
in part because of the popular sentiment in favor of iraq king 
hussein has still not committed himself fully to upholding the un 
sanctions another consideration is that jordan exports about 40 
percent of its goods to iraq 
consequently iraqi goods continue to pass through jorans red 
sea port of aqaba a hole in the international sanctions against 
iraq president bush has said he might have us warships block 
ships leaving and entering the port

purdue university researchers 
believe they have unlocked a key in the battle against alcoholism 
they have isolated a chunk of a hormone that makes the body feel 
good after drinking alcohol 
graduate student suchitra a krishnan studied rats who were 
placed under stress and then allowed to drink alcohol under both 
conditions they produced the adrenocorticotrophic hormone or acth 
we think a fragment of the hormone is responsible for making 
the rats want to drink alcohol after the stress is relieved even 
if they were low or nondrinkers before apparently they learn to 
drink to reproduce the good feeling said krishnan 
krishnan presented her findings tuesday at the 21st congress of 
the international society of psychoneuroendocrinology in buffalo 
ny 
krishnan and pharmacy professor roger p maickel said that if a 
drug containing the same amino acids as the feel good section 
of acth were given to alcoholics it might satisfy their desire to 
drink without alcohols many bad side effects 
in the study krishnan gauged the rats alcohol consumption by 
letting them drink from either of two bottles of sweetened water 
one containing 10 percent alcohol then the rats were divided into 
two groups made up of low moderate and heavy alcohol consumers 
krishnan caused stress among one group by closely confining them 
for periods of time over several days during the confinement the 
animals all drank less alcohol than each one had before being 
stressed but after the stress ended they generally drank two to 
three times more alcohol than before 
a second group of rats was not stressed but was injected with a 
piece of the acth molecule called acth410 for several days most 
drank no alcohol during that time but several days after the 
injections stopped they began drinking at twice to three times the 
rate they had before 
the acth410 acts like a reward mechanism to the rats 
krishnan said for the most part they didnt want to drink 
alcohol at all during the injections because they were already 
getting a substantial dose of the fragment

nasa engineers today struggled to 
restore radio contact with magellan after losing touch with the 
venusorbiting spacecraft for the second time in five days 
space agency engineers failure this morning to hear from 
magellan after the link broke indicated the crafts computerized 
emergency systems didnt immediately activate to help reestablish 
communication with earth nasa said 
so the engineers at nasas jet propulsion laboratory repeatedly 
sent new computer commands toward magellans presumed position 
around venus in an attempt to tell it to radio earth said nasa 
spokesman bob macmillin 
nothing was heard hours after the commands should have elicited 
a response from magellan engineers met to plan their next step 
bad news nothing not a peep out of it macmillin said 
its kind of a mystery 
contact was lost at 703 pm tuesday while nasa was tracking 
magellan with an antenna dish near canberra australia said 
laboratory spokesman jim doyle 
the latest blow to magellans 744 million mission to map venus 
came tuesday night less than eight hours after the space agency 
released the crafts first snapshots of venus 
the pictures revealed a remarkably violent landscape shaped by 
impact craters quake faults vast lava flows and ridges and 
valleys like those in the western united states 
the loss of magellan would be another major blow to nasa which 
grounded the space shuttle fleet temporarily because of fuel leaks 
and found the hubble space telescope was impaired by a flawed 
mirror 
the spacecrafts emergency systems allowed engineers to locate 
the spacecraft on friday more than 14 hours after they lost 
contact with it the first time eight hours later they restored 
steady contact by sending magellan a command to stop spinning and 
keep one of its antennas pointed at earth 
magellans mission is to map up to 90 percent of venus surface 
using radar to peer through the planets thick clouds which 
prevent the use of optical cameras the spacecraft went into orbit 
around venus on aug 10 after a roundabout 948millionmile trip 
it was launched from the shuttle atlantis 15 months ago 
when magellans first venus pictures were released tuesday 
magellan project manager tony spear said that as far as engineers 
could tell the spacecraft is healthy despite last weeks 
malfunction 
he and other engineers said they still hadnt figured out the 
cause of the problem but spear had been optimistic enough to say 
he still planned to have magellan start its venus mapping mission 
the first week of september 
jet propulsion laboratory is known for its ability to overcome 
problems with wayward spacecraft after the twin voyager probes 
were launched in 1977 one lost contact with earth for eight days 
the radio link was restored and the probes went on to explore the 
outer planets 
spacecraft system engineer john slonski said one leading theory 
to explain last weeks loss of contact with magellan was that a 
cosmic ray or a highenergy particle from the sun caused a blip in 
its computer memory 
were not ruling out a software flaw or some hardware 
problem or perhaps some unknown electrical fields surrounding 
venus spear said 
he also said cosmic ray hits on spacecraft electronics can 
be expected to interfere with magellan about once each year 
magellan made its first pictures of venus during a test 
conducted just before last weeks malfunction 
as promised by nasa magellans first pictures are 10 times more 
detailed than the best radar images of venus made by two soviet 
probes and a giant radio telescope in puerto rico they show 
details as small as 400 feet across 
the pictures show venus is intensely fractured and faulted 
with at least part of its terrain shaped by geological forces 
even more violent than i imagined before magellan project 
scientist steve saunders said tuesday 
the pictures cover a small portion of the planet near 
hawaiilike volcanic highlands 
the pictures show plains covered by six to 10milewide lava 
flows that solidified and then were cracked by faults saunders 
said the flows resemble those in hawaii or along the columbia and 
snake rivers in the pacific northwest 
also visible are a couple of volcanic cinder cones a 
20milewide meteorite crater and long parallel sets of two to 
threemilewide valleys and ridges that look like the basins and 
ranges of utah and nevada saunders said

likely leave today for the united arab emirates the sources said 
the squadron is equipped with amphibious antitank vehicles armed 
with cannons and machine guns 
the announcement by president francois mitterrand the deployment

with his approval to enforce the un embargo on iraq france has 
dispatched eight vessels to the region with 3800 men 
meanwhile turkeys defense minister safa giray said turkey 
might join the usled multinational force if our assessment 
shows this would be to the benefit of our country 
turkey has placed its air force in a state of readiness since 
the outbreak of the crisis caused by iraqs invasion of kuwait aug 
2 but officials have denied reports of troop movements to turkeys 
southern region and of deployment of us f117 stealth fighters in 
turkish bases and partial mobilization 
at the request of the united states ankara closed iraqi oil 
pipelines through turkey and severed trade ties with iraq 
in japan the largest opposition party today urged the 
government not to send personnel to the middle east 
in a meeting with prime minister toshiki kaifu socialist party 
chairwoman takako doi said the government should honor a law 
allowing emergency personnel to be sent only to nations hit by 
natural disasters party officials said 
japan has joined other countries in imposing economic sanctions 
against iraq for its invasion of kuwait but has not contributed 
personnel or financial support to the multinational forces 
stationed in the region 
in his meeting with ms doi kaifu cited japans growing 
responsibility in international affairs kyodo news service 
reported 
japan is more dependent on middle east oil than any other 
industrialized country and obtained 112 percent of its oil from 
iraq and kuwait in the first quarter of the year 
in jiddah saudi arabia defense ministers from the sixnation 
gulf cooperation council met today to discuss defense strategy 
abdullah bishara the general secretary of the alliance told 
kuwaiti television before the meeting that the council has decided 
to muster the troops of the penisula shield rapid deployment force 
the force of up to 10000 troops has been based for the last two 
years at the northeastern saudi base of hafr albaten 
the bulk of the multinational military force has been deployed 
by the united states which is leading a huge buildup of ground 
air and sea forces in and around saudi arabia to defend it against 
possible iraqi aggression 
the pentagon has refused to disclose the precise number of 
american troops in the region or on the way but gen hansford t 
johnson the top official responsible for getting troops and 
supplies to saudi arabia indicated it was 35000 an additional 
20000 sailors are deployed on warships in the area 
in addition to tens of thousands of american troops there are 
smaller numbers of soldiers from egypt syria and morocco the 
force also includes warships from the western allies 
military officials have estimated that iraq has up to 170000 
soldiers in kuwait and hundreds of tanks and missiles 
meanwhile kuwaits ousted government pledged today to step up 
its armed struggle against iraqi invaders through guerrilla attacks 
and conventional warfare 
crown prince sheik saad alabdullah alsabah told a news 
conference in cairo that kuwaiti attacks on iraqi occupation forces 
would increase within days most of the world still considers the 
alsabah family led by emir jaber alahmed alsabah the 
legitimate rulers of kuwait 
there have been reports of kuwaiti guerrilla resistance since 
the invasion but they have not been confirmed independently 
the reports included accounts of attacks by suicide vehicle 
bombers and blowing up of iraqi tanks and fuel trucks 
in iraq the baghdad observer newspaper warned that any flareup 
in the gulf will lead to allout war 
one should not expect the iraqis to sit idle when their towns 
and population centers are being bombarded by the us planes and 
shells

nations if it is attacked the statecontrolled paper said

iraqi president saddam hussein is a destructive 
loser whose hostagetaking reflects his isolation in the region 
and the world foreign secretary douglas hurd said today 
prime minister margaret thatcher said she was deeply upset 
by reports that iraq soldiers continue to round up britons at 
gunpoint in kuwait 
our nationals should be looked after very well indeed its a 
scandal the way they are being treated mrs thatcher told 
reporters 
iraqs invasion of kuwait on aug 2 trapped 4500 britons in 
iraq and kuwait the foreign office said on monday that 137 of the 
british citizens are known to have been rounded up in kuwait and 
none in iraq 
the foreign office said today it has traced 97 of the britons 
held in kuwait and that 76 of them are at civilian installations 
press association britains domestic news agency said the 
indication was that the other 21 britons were held at military 
installations foreign office spokesmen were unavailable to 
immediately comment on the situation of the 21 
hurd expressed satisfaction with decisions tuesday by greece and 
spain to join the international naval force in the persian gulf and 
by the western european union to coordinate military action 
he said he was also pleased that the european community refused 
to close embassies in kuwait as iraq had ordered britain has 
rejected the order to close its embassy although the foreign 
office said the staff would be reduced from the current 10 to a 
core group of three or four diplomats 
you see the pressures which are building up at our 
instigation hurd said in an interview with bbc radio 
i think this policy of saddam husseins is a loser it was 
designed to weaken particularly european opionion what happened 
yesterday showed it has had the opposite effect its 
strengthening 
it portrays him instead of being a warrior as being a worried 
man sheltering behind women and children and that im sure is bad 
news for him 
hurd said that iraqs tactic of placing western citizens in 
harms way to deter military attacks was a strategy of desperation 
by a nation without any strong allies 
this human shield policy is not going to work hurd said 
if any of the hostages were harmed he said that of course 
would create a new situation we have never ruled out further 
measures neither we nor the americans the prime minister and i 
have all been very clear that we do not rule out further measures 
if the economic measures dont work 
defense secretary tom king appearing on bbctv said the 
hostages must not influence the policy of britain and its allies 
we have to take decisions in the interests of ending 
aggression we cant take hostages into account in this situation 
or we run the risk that more hostages will be taken he said 
hurd said he was encouraged the majority of arab states have 
supported the sanctions against iraq and that some have contributed 
military forces 
the fact is that saddam hussein has kicked the arabs in the 
teeth hurd said 
anyone interested in the arabisrael dispute anyone 
interested in a settlement there and a peace process there thats 
been put way on the back burner by whom by saddam hussein hes a 
loser a destructive loser hurd said

the air force bombed and strafed 
targets on the jaffna peninsula today in what military officials 
called a new offensive against the northern stronghold of the tamil 
tiger rebels 
planes dropped leaflets over the peninsula tuesday announcing an 
indefinite curfew and warning more than 850000 civilians to stay 
out of the line of fire said the officials who spoke on condition 
of anonymity 
the curfew took effect at 6 am local time today and the 
planes began bombing runs an hour later the officials said 
they said the aerial attacks were directed at identified 
terrorist targets the military was accused earlier this year of 
indiscriminately bombing civilians in jaffna 
deputy defense minister ranjan wijeratne was quoted in a 
government statement as telling foreign diplomats that the bombing 
was carried out after careful intelligence assessment to minimize 
any loss of civilian life 
the peninsula 185 miles northeast of colombo is the 
headquarters of the liberation tigers of tamil eelam the main 
guerrilla organization seeking an independent tamil state in the 
north and east of this indian ocean island 
the tigers broke a 13month ceasefire on june 11 to reopen its 
7yearold campaign for independence from the sinhalesedominated 
government 
the tigers have beseiged about 250 policemen and soldiers inside 
jaffna fort since the fighting resumed in june three other camps 
including an airstrip also are cut off by the insurgents 
officials in colombo the capital said one man in the fort was 
killed by sniper fire tuesday 
an offensive has been widely expected since july when 
government troops seized positions in several villages south of 
elephant pass which controls the causeway and the only road to the 
peninsula 
but the governments attention has focused on the east coast 
where the tigers have been pushed out of the major towns the east 
also has been the scene of communal violence among the tamil 
sinhalese and moslems in which hundreds of civilians have been 
killed 
at least 14000 people have died since the civil war began in 
1983 over tamil claims of discrimination by the sinhalese majority 
the mainly buddhist sinhalese who make up 75 percent of the 
countrys 16 million people control the government and military 
tamils who are mainly hindu comprise 18 percent while moslems 
account for 7 percent

robbery was the motive in the killings of 
three automotive parts store employees shot at pointblank range 
investigators say 
police were looking today for the killer or killers who tied up 
the super shops employees when the store closed sunday evening 
super shops president gregg koechlein would not say tuesday how 
much cash was stolen from the store but its so inconsequential 
an amount to think that three people were killed for this it 
shocks the conscience he said 
other company officials said the days cash receipts probably 
did not exceed several thousand dollars 
even if you get a million dollars is it worth executing three 
people this is just a vicious coldblooded killing theres no 
other way to describe it said city police lt houston williams 
the victims were identified as assistant manager darrell esgar 
22 of huntington beach and salesmen chad chadwick 22 of orange 
and russell williams 21 of seal beach

influence outside his region

anc in natal province for the past five year in a contest that has 
claimed some 5000 lives

six opec nations are considering 
holding an informal meeting this weekend to discuss the turmoil in 
the oil markets caused by the persian gulf crisis sources close to 
the cartel said today 
oil prices edged higher in london on crisis jitters today north 
sea brent crude oil for october delivery was valued at 2790 a 
barrel at midday up from tuesdays 2710 
in latemorning trading on the new york mercantile exchange the 
october contract for west texas intermediate the benchmark grade 
of us crude was up 64 cents to 2935 a 42gallon barrel the 
september contract for unleaded gasoline gained 174 cents to 103 
a gallon while home heating oil shot up 379 cents to 8750 cents 
a gallon 
meanwhile some tankers were being reflagged to avoid economic 
sanctions against iraq the spanish oil company compania espanola 
de petroleo sa said it planned to transfer 126000 tons of nigerian 
crude oil from a barred iraqiflagged tanker to another ship to 
allow the oil to be imported to a canary island refinery 
the spanish merchant marine had barred the iraqiflagged 
almuntanabbi from spanish ports monday but a merchant marine 
spokesman said today the deparment agreed to the transfer of the 
nigerian crude to a neutral ship 
the kuwaitiflagged triden arrow blocked saturday by spain from 
unloading 1000 tons of brazilian cotton in barcelona switched to 
the liberian flag tuesday and was permitted to unload 
regarding opec plans indonesia has suggested that six of the 13 
members of the organization of petroleum exporting countries gather 
in vienna on sunday to examine the situation according to the 
sources who demanded anonymity 
the sources stressed that no final decision has yet been made on 
whether to meet 
it may or may not be held said one source if it is it 
will be very very informal no decisions could be made at the 
gathering he said 
the idea of the consultations is apparently an attempt at a 
compromise between those countries which want an emergency meeting 
of all the cartels members and those which do not 
on monday opec announced that there was no majority support for 
a saudi arabian request to call an urgent meeting 
the kingdoms oil minister hisham nazer said last saturday 
that his country intended to increase oil production by 2 million 
barrels a day with or without opecs approval higher saudi pumping 
would make up about half of the loss of some 4 million barrels a 
day caused by the international embargo on iraqi and kuwaiti oil 
that followed iraqs aug 2 invasion of kuwait 
nazer had urged the cartel to hold an emergency session to 
discuss the situation the united arab emirates qatar venezuela 
and ecuador were said to support his plea 
irans oil minister gholamreza aqazadeh said he opposed an 
emergency meeting because there was enough crude in storage to make 
up for the loss of iraqi and kuwaiti crude 
under the indonesia proposal the sources said iran saudi 
arabia nigeria algeria indonesia and venezuela would gather for 
the informal talks 
those nations represent two committees recently set up by the 
cartel to monitor oil production and include algeria which holds 
the cartels presidency and indonesia which is the alternate 
president 
in its statement on monday opec said algerian mining minister 
sadek boussena the cartels president would hold consultations 
with some ministers before the end of the month it did not 
elaborate 
saudi arabia which pumps about a quarter of the cartels oil 
has an opecset production quota of just under 54 million barrels 
a day 
at their summer conference last month opec ministers agreed to 
limit their output to 225 million barrels a day in the last half 
of the year to try to push crude prices up to 21 a barrel 
with the gulf crisis the average price of a basket of crudes 
monitored by the group surged last week to 2529 a barrel 
the next formal meeting of the organization is not scheduled 
until middecember

here is the statement issued today by state 
department spokesman richard boucher on the situation in kuwait 
consistent with united nations security council resolution 662 
the government of the united states along with most other nations 
represented in kuwait has rejected the iraqi demand for the 
closure of diplomatic missions in kuwait and will be retaining a 
diplomatic presence in that country ambassador howell will remain 
in charge 
this is consistent not only with security council resolutions 
but also with our obligations to the american private community 
who along with other foreign nationals have been deprived of the 
freedom to leave and return to their home countries 
we will continue to insist that the iraqi occupation authorities 
accept responsibility for the protection of american citizens and 
accord them their basic rights 
we will also insist that american diplomats in kuwait continue 
to receive the full protection which their status accords them 
under international law 
american citizens should be assured that we plan to have 
sufficient diplomatic staff at the embassy in kuwait to look after 
their safety and welfare which remains our highest priority they 
will serve our community to the best of their ability 
citizens should also know that the united states government will 
continue to work with others to insist on the full implementation 
of un security council resolution 664 which demands that iraq 
permit and facilitate the departure of all foreigners from kuwait 
and iraq as well as immediate and continuing consular access to 
foreign nationals

the five permanent members of the un 
security council met today to try to draft a resolution calling for 
a military blockade to enforce international economic sanctions 
against iraq 
the soviet union has slowed us efforts to get un approval 
for a military blockade western diplomats say and the private 
meeting today was expected to discuss soviet concerns 
the diplomats said tuesday that moscow has sought clear and 
demonstrable failure of the un embargo before approving any un 
military force 
china had dragged its feet for the same reason but a kuwaiti 
official in beijing said today the chinese government promised not 
to block such a move 
the meeting was held at the french mission and involved 
representatives from the united states soviet union china 
britain and france 
on his way into the meeting us ambassador thomas r pickering 
said well be continuing our consultations in the day pushing 
toward hopefully trying to do something today if its at all 
possible 
asked if the soviets were blocking progress pickering replied 
well i dont put my finger on anybody well wait and see 
soviet foreign minister eduard a shevardnadze said in an 
interview published tuesday that some elements of iraqi president 
saddam husseins proposal to end the middle east crisis merit 
serious attention 
saddam offered on sunday to free thousands of foreign hostages 
in iraq and iraqioccupied kuwait if the usled multinational 
force protecting saudi arabia from iraqi aggression withdraws and 
the united states guarantees the un embargo on iraq will be 
lifted 
i think that there are elements which attract attention 
shevardnadze was quoted as telling the soviet newspaper pravda 
we are studying all the details all the blocks of the speech of 
the president of iraq 
the western diplomats speaking on condition of anonymity said 
the soviet and chinese objections have slowed the momentum for 
tougher measures following the nearunanimity of the security 
council in four previous votes against iraqs invasion of kuwait on 
aug 2 
the permanent security council members deliberated a 
precedentsetting proposal tuesday that would authorize foreign 
naval vessels to use minimum force in policing the un embargo no 
final action was taken any of the five permanent council members 
can kill council resolutions with a veto 
the soviets in the past week have wanted to revive the military 
staff committee before imposing a blockade the committee consists 
of military officers of the five permanent officers to coordinate 
un enforcement actions but it has never had an active role even 
during the 195053 korean war 
soviet ambassador valentin lozinsky last week told security 
council that the soviets would participate in a blockade only under 
a un flag 
for the second day in a row shevardnadze met in moscow tuesday 
with iraqi deputy prime minister saadoun hammadi but the soviet 
news agency tass gave few details of their talks hammadi also 
spoke with soviet prime minister nikolai ryzhkov who urged iraq to 
allow foreigners to leave its territory 
 
kuwaits foreign minister sheik sabah alahmed said in beijing 
today that china has promised not to veto military enforcement of 
the un embargo he met this morning with premier li peng and 
foreign minister wu xueqian but the kuwaiti official did not say 
from whom he extracted the promise 
chinese ambassador li daoyu in the first public statement about 
the beijing governments stand said tuesday that security council 
decisions thus far imply no permission for military involvement 
by big powers and their naval blockade 
under the present circumstances he told the xinhua news 
agency resort to military actions will lead to further 
aggravation of the situation and escalation of the armed conflict 
which does not help solving the problem 
he urged that efforts be channeled through the security 
councils sanctions committee before military action was authorized 
li did not say how china would vote on military involvement but 
diplomats said china was likely to abstain and not cast a lone 
veto all five permanent council members have veto power and can 
kill any resolution 
the united states britain and france were supportive of a 
unique resolution which would provide a un umbrella but not a 
un flag and command for international warships enforcing the 
embargo britains un ambassador argued that such a possible 
momentous step requires that all nations move extremely 
carefully 
in a display of unprecedented cooperation the 15member 
security council has adopted four mandatory resolutions in the past 
three weeks condemning iraqs aug 2 invasion of kuwait calling 
for sweeping economic sanctions against iraq rejecting iraqs 
annexation of kuwait and demanding freedom for thousands of 
foreigners held against their will in iraq and kuwait 
under article 42 of the un charter the security council may 
call for a blockade and enforcement of its embargo through military 
force if its earlier sanctions have been violated article 42 
never has been invoked for a un enforcement action

military experts sent to iraq before its invasion 
of kuwait continue working for the iraqi government despite a 
kremlin order to sever all trade and financial ties with baghdad a 
soviet colonel said today 
the 193 soviet experts have been training iraqi soldiers to use 
sovietbuilt weapons repairing and maintaining those weapons and 
building test ranges col valentin ogurtsov told a news briefing 
they are fulfilling their contractual duties he said 
soviet experts are not involved in military operations and did 
not provide advice for iraqs aug 2 invasion of kuwait he said 
soviet prime minister nikolai ryzhkov issued an order to all 
soviet agencies earlier today to cut business ties with iraq to 
comply with un sanctions the tass news agency reported 
the soviet union had been iraqs main arms supplier providing 
most of its modern tanks missiles and jet fighters 
but the day after the iraqi invasion the soviet union cut arms 
supplies to baghdad and ogurtsov said one weapons shipment was 
stopped in transit foreign minister eduard shevardnadze and us 
secretary of state james a baker iii signed a joint statement 
condemning iraqs attack on its oilrich neighbor 
but the soviet union together with china has slowed us 
efforts at the united nations for military action to back up the 
economic embargo of iraq western diplomats say 
foreign ministry spokesman yuri gremitskikh rejected repeated 
questions about whether the continuing work by the military experts 
violated the un emgargo and the soviet government order 
he said nationals from other countries continued to work in 
iraq although he did not identify the nations or jobs their 
nationals were performing 
iraq has made hostages out of thousands of foreigners who were 
trapped in iraq and kuwait by the invasion iraq has also moved 
some foreigners to iraqi military installations to prevent an 
attack by a usled multinational force being deployed in saudi 
arabia to protect it against iraqi aggression 
this is not a simple solution gremitskikh said dont 
single out the soviet union i dont think this presence runs 
counter to the united nations position 
ogurtsov said that when the soviet government contracted to sell 
weapons to iraq it also agreed to provide technical experts to 
show iraq how to use them 
gremitskikh said when the contracts expire the experts will 
leave and will not be replaced the contracts range from 10 days to 
one year ogurtsov said 
at the present time they work not only in training centers 
but on test ranges suppose we supplied a new type of tank it has 
new unknown capabilities to the local personnel so we build a kind 
of test range to test it this is the kind of activity they are 
involved in ogurtsov said 
we are trying to make the period of stay shorter and shorter 
but we are going to phase out the work eventually ogurtsov said 
the military experts were among 7791 soviets stranded in iraq 
after its attack on kuwait gremitskikh said soviet women and 
children would begin to be evacuated from iraq on sunday he 
indicated that iraq would then allow soviet men to be evacuated 
also today a special envoy from saudi arabia arrived in moscow 
the soviet union has no diplomatic relations with the kingdom 
gremitskikh said iraqs deputy prime minister saadoun hammadi met 
with shevardnadze monday and tuesday 
saudi arabia and moscow had full diplomatic relations until 
1938 when dictator josef stalin closed his embassy in jiddah to 
cut costs 
several attempts to reestablish ties during the 1980s faltered 
over what saudia arabia called the soviet unions belligerent 
attitude toward its 50 million moslems

the citys new police chief has two unresolved 
departmental charges against him according to a georgia bureau of 
investigation report 
atlanta police department records on eldrin a bell show the 
departments internal affairs unit recommended charges against him 
in 1989 for allegedly operating a security business in the city a 
conflict of interest and doing it without departmental permission 
the records were contained in the gbi report given to mayor 
maynard jackson prior to bells nomination for police chief which 
the atlanta city council approved monday 
bell refused to speak with reporters tuesday and denied there 
were open charges against him he also has maintained he no longer 
has an interest in a security business 
the mayor who said monday the gbi report contained nothing new 
first said tuesday there were no open charges but later criticized 
former chief morris g redding for not resolving the open charges 
before retiring last month 
the first time i found out the former chief did not do his 
duty was over the past few days said jackson who has asked 
acting city attorney joe harris to look into the matter 
the charges allege bell who will oversee a force of 1590 
officers operated a security business based in the zone he 
commanded in 1988 and that he hired offduty zone officers to work 
for his firm taking care of business inc 
the allegations against bell were made by the international 
brotherhood of police officers union 
deputy chief wj taylor who was acting chief and a finalist 
for the job said he was aware of the unresolved charges against 
bell but did not act 
i thought it inappropriate to adjudicate disciplinary action 
against another candidate he said 
he said the file was still sitting on the desk where redding 
left it when he retired i didnt read the file he said 
i had decided not to make a decision until the new chief is 
appointed i wanted to remain neutral redding said in a july gbi 
interview 
he added that if the charges were upheld bell could have faced 
a maximum one or twoday suspension

king hussein said today his country is 
heavily burdened by thousands of refugees fleeing kuwait and may 
have to slow down the process of receiving them 
on the human level we have some serious problems he told 
reporters at a nationally televised news conference 
we have received within jordan since the beginning of this 
crisis an approximate number of 185000 people of different 
nationalities 
of the nearly 120000 refugees who remain in jordan he said 
we are finding enormous difficulty in meeting the needs of these 
people or in arranging adequate modes of transport for them to 
leave jordan 
many egyptians palestinians and other mostly arab refugees 
fleeing kuwait since the aug 2 invasion by iraq have entered 
jordan 
only a few of the thousands of westerners trapped in iraq and 
kuwait including about 3000 americans have been able to flee to 
safety the rest are being held as hostages by iraq 
we may have to slow down the process of receiving more people 
unless we can speed up the movement of people to their respective 
destinations hussein said we are trying our very best to 
provide food and shelter and medical facitilities 
hussein also said he would continue efforts to help bring a 
peaceful solution to the persian gulf crisis saying any escalation 
would have a devastating effect on this region and the world 
i am in touch with leaders throughout the world and we will 
continue to do our utmost to contribute to the solution of the 
crisis to the best of our ability he said

president bush today ordered 
military reserves to active duty signing an executive order that 
calls an unspecified number of reservists to bolster the us 
military effort in the persian gulf 
the order did not give a number of reservists involved in the 
callup but press secretary marlin fitzwater said we do not 
anticipate approaching the full 200000 authority provided by law 
i hereby determine that it is necessary to augment the active 
armed forces of the united states for the effective conduct of 
operational missions in and around the arabian peninsula bushs 
executive order said 
bush sent letters to the speaker of the house and the president 
of the senate to inform them of the action telling them his order 
empowers secretary of defense dick cheney to designate the 
reservists to perform missions he may determine necessary 
an administration official said the pentagon expects to call up 
40000 reservists between now and the end of august 
the official speaking on condition of anonymity was asked if 
more could be ordered to duty later well have to see the 
official said forty thousand is initially what were looking 
at 
the callup will focus on personnel who can fill the jobs of 
active duty forces on duty in the gulf in such areas as cargo 
handling airlift food and water handling surface transportation 
medical services construction and intelligence fitzwater said in 
a statement 
while taking reservists from their normal jobs may be 
disruptive the pentagon told reporters what must be emphasized 
is that those who have been ordered to active duty are vital to our 
national commitment in this operation 
announcement of the callup came shortly before bush met here 
with cheney national security adviser brent scowcraft and gen 
colin powell chairman of the joint chiefs of staff 
it was the first time the president has activated the reserves 
since march 1970 when the reserves were called up during a postal 
strike 
presidents have called up the reserves 10 times since world war 
ii 
the 26273 reservists called up by president nixon in 1970 
helped deliver the mail during the postal strike the last 
mobilization of reserves for a hostile action occurred from january 
1968 to december 1969 when president johnson called up more than 
35000 reservists to help with the vietnam war 
white house chief of staff john sununu said this would be a 
very surgical specialized callup of personnel in specific 
jobs rather than a broad callup 
meanwhile the administration decided today to reduce the staff 
of the us embassy in kuwait but to keep it open despite a demand 
by iraqi president saddam hussein 
the state department announced the us intention to defy 
saddams demand to close the embassy by friday spokesman richard 
boucher said the decision was consistent with un security council 
resolutions and also with our obligations to the american private 
community 
bush summoned his top defense advisers to kennebunkport to get 
an update on the gulf situation cheney and powell were expected to 
report that the united states is approaching a target of 100000 
military personnel in the region said one source speaking on 
condition of anonymity 
officials have declined to give specific figures but the air 
force general in charge of transporting troops to saudi arabia 
gen hansford t johnson indicated tuesday that at least 35000 
us troops are there or en route another estimated 20000 us 
troops are at sea in the area 
the pentagon has said that reservists subject to the callup 
will serve with their units but once they report for duty some 
could be transferred to other locations 
the rationale for the callup the pentagon said last week was 
that the airlift sealift and support requirements for this 
operation are enormous 
allvolunteer reservists are well aware of their missions and 
train intensively often with the active force to be ready 
according to the pentagon 
cheney arrived in washington late tuesday after a fourday tour 
of five persian gulf states 
he met tuesday with saudi officials to share military 
intelligence and discuss the possible sale of additional f15 
fighters and heavy tanks to bolster the kingdoms defenses the 
saudis are hosting the massive buildup of us forces and equipment 
as iraq moves missiles into kuwait within target range of many 
saudi cities 
officials claim a successful trip for cheney whose meetings 
with the leaders of bahrain the united arab emirates oman and 
qatar were intended to seek support for the usled military 
operation 
the defense secretary said the bush administration also favors 
increasing aid to egypt 
fitzwater told reporters tuesday the world is united in 
demanding unconditional withdrawal of iraqi president saddam 
husseins army from kuwait 
speaking at a falmouth maine golf tournament where bush was 
playing fitzwater shot down iraqs televised offer tuesday to 
conduct talks saying the administration considered it the same 
rhetoric that weve heard before 
western nations are willing to talk to iraqi officials about the 
welfare of their citizens held in iraq and kuwait he said but 
thats not the same as negotiations over a united nations demand 
to get out 
in addition to freedom for the westerners we demand complete 
and unconditional withdrawal from kuwait that is the position of 
the united nations and thats the position of all nations 
fitzwater said

sex with saddam hussein if he agrees to free foreigners he is 
holding in iraq

arizona daily star tucson ariz on the persian gulf 
if the united states expects to hold the respect of its fellow 
members in the united nations it ought to abide by embargo rules 
against iraq and kuwait 
and if uncle sam wants broad cooperation in the un sanctions 
he will accept the un security councils guidance and restrain 
himself from military action on his own the bush administration 
thinks it has the authority to maneuver mighty us naval ships 
into the way of food and commodity ships bound for iraq and oil 
ships on their way out it doesnt 
nothing is gained for the bush administration to step outside 
the bounds of the body its trying to rally into joint action 
against iraq sanctions against iraq and tiny kuwait which iraq 
forcibly seized could become particularly potent if theyre given 
time to work 
the sanctions are vital and eventually should coerce iraq into 
negotiating but sanctions compliance cant involve warships and 
gunfire unless the security council decides the boycott isnt being 
honored lets stick to the rules

houston chronicle on the persian gulf 
if george bush and saddam hussein were eyeball to eyeball 
saddam blinked sometime on aug 7 
former secretary of state dean rusks classic characterization 
of a confrontation seems only too appropriate to the touchandgo 
moment when saddam first started backing down 
other arabs true to middle east tradition seemed the first to 
sense it 
saddam blinked when he failed to move against saudi arabia in 
that short period when he knew american forces were coming but 
hadnt gotten there yet it was the time when he could have had his 
maximum leverage taking the ground and forcing the americans to 
fight their way in if they wanted to in those dramatically 
changed circumstances 
it is no coincidence that most of the other arab states not 
directly involved moved against saddam as soon as they saw he 
didnt strike at saudi arabia during the moment of opportunity 
they sensed right the iraqi dictator has been steadily backing 
away since in one form or another 
the danger is by no means over there is still plenty of 
opportunity for explosion but saddam shifted from power to 
propaganda at the moment he chose not to fight he is trying to 
change the subject from the invasion and annexation of kuwait to an 
overall antiisraeli anticolonial panarabic struggle 
the challenge to everyone else is now to be as smart and 
cooperative in rejecting this ploy as they were in facing saddam 
down militarily

the indianapolis news on reporting the persian gulf crisis 
the pentagon has developed a bad habit of keeping the news media 
from doing their job 
beginning with the invasion of grenada the pentagon has fallen 
into a pattern of keeping the press from covering the activities of 
the us military this is a grave mistake 
after grenada it happened again in panama and it has happened 
again in saudi arabia the american public should protest loudly 
not until seven days after the united states sent troops to 
saudi arabia did the pentagon allow us journalists to travel 
along with american troops and cover the story they also waited a 
week to grant reporters access to the ships that guard the gulf of 
oman and the persian gulf 
when the united states moves troops it can and should send 
journalists along with them 
the american people have a right to know what is happening to 
their sons and daughters they have a right to know what really is 
happening in the persian gulf 
and they have the obligation to see that the pentagon begins to 
act responsibly in its dealings with the press

the oregonian portland ore on us military bases in 
philippines 
negotiations are scheduled to begin later this month over the 
future of us military bases in the philippines the treaty 
governing the bases expires next year 
the outcome is uncertain and the political situation in the 
philippines is unstable thats why the united states must continue 
to pursue alternatives to philippine bases negotiations with 
singapore for example should continue even as manila talks begin 
nevertheless the philippine bases are important and for the 
talks to have any chance of success certain steps are needed 
the united states must respond to the challenge of the 
philippine senates nationalist bloc the main group opposed to the 
bases the opinion of nationalist senators has to be considered 
because the senate must ratify any new bases treaty they charge 
the bases are a remnant of us colonial rule and benefit only the 
united states 
the bases do serve us security interests but they also 
contribute substantially to the philippine economy and security 
against outside aggression 
the united states might win points by offering to link a new 
treaty more securely to the welfare of more filipinos for example 
a new treaty could award more ship repair contracts to filipino 
companies but only if they meet us standards of competence and 
have a track record of honest business dealings 
finally us representatives must enter the negotiations with a 
clear idea of what the united states can afford

us soldiers deployed to defend 
saudi arabia are finding the biggest challenge of desert operations 
is carrying enough water 
to prevent dehydration the americans have been told to drink 
about five gallons of water a day that means when soldiers go out 
on desert patrols theyre loaded up with an extra 1015 pounds in 
backpacks that already weigh about 30 pounds 
because of the extra weight they have to stop every 15 or 20 
minutes for a break 
i usually carry four canteens with me said lt james mead 
a marine who trained in desert warfare at twentynine palms calif 
in the mojave desert 
the marines and army are assigned to the eastern province of 
saudi arabia but us defense department rules prevent identifying 
their exact location the names of enlisted men interviewed cannot 
be reported 
the logistics of hauling enough water for the thousands of 
americans in saudi arabia is just one of the hurdles facing troops 
as they settle into position everywhere soldiers go in the desert 
they drag a 5000gallon water tank in a trailer behind their truck 
although most of the men have desert experience some in egypt 
somalia and jordan the reality of a possible longterm assignment 
in the broiling sands of the arabian peninsula came as a shock 
they said it would be hot but not this hot said a marine 
as he relaxed in his shorts during a break 
the united states has not fought a desert war since 1943 when it 
joined with britain to defeat germany in north africa remembering 
that conflict not so far away a member of the 82nd airborne 
carried a copy of the book rommels desert war in his pack 
the temperature rises to above 120 degrees here creating 
furnacelike conditions particularly for airmen in flight suits 
these dont breathe real well said doug a marine cobra 
pilot pointing to his full body suit made of nomex a fire 
retardant material 
the cobra an attack helicopter is airconditioned but other 
helicopters like the huey and the ch53 both used to transport 
troops are not 
in the sun the men must stay covered from head to toe even 
wrapping a cloth around the neck to prevent sunburn all wear hats 
sunglasses and sunscreen 
chapped lips have becomed such a problem the marines have 
ordered extra balm said maj mark hughes 
the vastness and unique conditions of the arabian desert have 
posed problems 
ground troops often spend twice as long digging a foxhole 
because the sand is so fine it collapses on itself 
pilots have had trouble reading their navigational maps in a 
terrain altered by constantly shifting sands 
the intense heat affects nagivational equipment causing slight 
variations in the readings 
in addition there are the standard problems faced in any desert 
the sand clogs machinery forcing added maintenance and extra 
spare parts 
concealment becomes paramount as the men try to hide their 
position in an exposed area they use camoflauged netting to cover 
the tents 
we move at night so people wont see us said chris a 
marine platoon commander 
delivering supplies is difficult because helicopters and 
vehicles leave telltale dust clouds and tracks that are easily 
spotted by the enemy

bulldozers guarded by thousands of riot police 
wednesday began demolishing the headquarters of a radical group 
that has been fighting expansion of tokyos international airport

guarded by 6500 riot police bulldozers began demolishing iron 
fences surrounding sanrizuka struggle hall a twostory 
prefabricated headquarters built by local farmers and the extremist 
group chukakuha or middle core faction the group opposes the 
airport expansion as part of its antigovernment campaign 
four radicals occupying the headquarters defied a government 
order to leave the building which is less than a mile from a 
4400yard runway under construction 
the radicals threw bottles and chunks of cement at officials and 
reporters before police arrested them 
in a statement airport authority president kauharu matsui said 
the demolition of the headquarters is very significant for our 
smooth negotiations in the future to obtain the land still 
necessary to resume the expansion of the airport as well for the 
airport security 
the government plans to build a new terminal and two additional 
runways by the end of march 1991 to cope with overcrowding at the 
12yearold airport 
of the 2630 acres of land sought for the expansion project the 
government still needs to acquire 526 additional acres including 
40 acres held by eight farmers who refuse to move said kaoru 
shirohata spokesman for the new international airport authority 
the airport authority says the airport is handling more than 19 
million passengers a year 6 million more than its official 
capacity

newsrepublic baraboo wis on marion barry 
washington dc residents have been cheering the virtual 
acquittal of mayor marion barry on drug charges 
its a strange situation considering what should have been 
destructive testimony that barry has been a drug user 
while the mayor was found guilty of one misdemeanor drug 
possession charge a mistrial was declared on 12 other charges 
including felonies 
barry could still be retried on the charges and attorneys are 
considering such a move 
but in the meantime barry has received what amounts to a 
heros welcome from many residents of washington 
thats a sad commentary on conditions in the nations capital 
during barrys trial his defense counsel admitted that barry has 
used cocaine a very dangerous drug 
that means that barry lied to the nation and to his constituents 
when he earlier denied involvement with drugs further he used his 
office to perpetrate and advance that lie 
all the while he was factitiously engaged in a war against 
drugs 
barrys supporters have said that the trials outcome was 
vindication from a persecution by federal officials they have 
labeled it a battle between the white establishment and 
disenfranchised blacks 
in their current support of barry what they are really saying 
is that its ok to use drugs if youre black and that legal action 
against black users is racial persecution 
they have put a man above the law in a system where the rule of 
law is paramount 
barry should be ashamed and step down from public office he has 
violated the public trust yet his fans cheered the outcome of the 
trial and barry plans to run for a spot on the citys council

albuquerque nm journal on the need for students to speak 
english 
few should argue with secretary of education lauro cavazos 
insistence that children in the united states are not ready to 
learn if they cannot speak english on their first day of school 
the position particularly angers hispanics and educators 
for many nonenglishspeaking students the burden of learning 
both a new language and simultaneously studying other subjects can 
be a heavy one that child often starts dropping behind classmates 
almost immediately many never catch up an observation supported 
by high dropout statistics among the children of many minority 
groups 
criticism of the cavazos position is ethnocentric and ignores 
the fact that most of the nations commerce government education 
and communication is conducted exclusively in english those with a 
poor command of the language are at an immediate disadvantage in 
the community 
cavazos is of a generation of hispanics that recalls with some 
bitterness punishment meted out in both private and public schools 
to those who spoke spanish in the classroom practices have 
changed but the need for children to speak and understand english 
very early in their school years has not

the columbus ohio dispatch on genetic engineering 
more than 100 genetically engineered drugs vaccines and other 
substances have been approved by the food and drug administration 
these have been used against diabetes and hemophilia among other 
things in recent years the good they have done is incalculable 
but there is a downside too particularly when a genetically 
engineered substance is not considered a drug and therefore does 
not come under close fda scrutiny 
and that is what happened with tainted ltryptophan that last 
year killed 27 and injured 1500 americans the genetically 
engineered bacterium developed by a janapese drug company showa 
denko kk was widely used as a nutritional supplement and sleep 
aid 
in the genetic engineering process its believed a byproduct 
called peak e was produced which may cause ems a rare and 
sometimes fatal blood disease 
although bacteria have been used for years in the manufacture of 
biologically active substances only since 1975 have there been 
manmade alterations in the genetic structures of common bacteria 
this may be the first known example of biotechnology gone awry 
but even so it raises serious questions about the nations growing 
biotechnology industry should there be more supervision if so 
should the government do it 
fda officials have said the growing use of genetic engineering 
in the manufacture of drugs and dietary products is something the 
agency plans to look at in the future 
lets hope the agency does this before another accident produces 
deadly results

new haven conn register on margarine 
add another memo to your everything in moderation file 
gorging on margarine instead of butter is not the way to stave 
off heart disease 
a dutch study published in the new england journal of 
medicine found that margarine contains fatty acids that actually 
increase coronary risk by raising blood levels of a harmful form of 
cholesterol and lowering the levels of a form that protects against 
heart disease 
doctors are quick to caution people not to switch back to 
gorging on butter butter still has a more damaging effect on 
cholesterol than margarine doctors wisely advise people instead 
to use margarine in fact all fats in moderation 
doctors would probably also be the first to agree that you dont 
have to spend a decade in medical school to develop a recipe for a 
healthful life and lifestyle if we all adhered to the common sense 
rule of everything in moderation food exercise work

happier its excess that ruins us not moderation

at least 13 congressmen belong to national 
guard or military reserve units but they cant be called to active 
duty unless they first give up their seats 
any time there is a mobilization of guard and reserve units the 
pentagon automatically puts members of congress and other top 
government officials who are reservists or guardsmen on standby 
their name is in a computer thats about all it amounts to 
said a congressional staffer who didnt want his name used 
to see active military duty whether combat or a war of nerves 
with iraqs saddam hussein members of congress would have to first 
surrender their seats 
rep dave mccurdy dokla a captain and member of the judge 
advocates corps in the air force reserve said lawmakers werent 
likely to resign for a limited callup 
if there is an acknowledged war and the entire nation is 
mobilized mccurdy said i think well all go 
seven of mccurdys colleagues are in the reserves and five more 
are active in their state national guard units all fall under 
federal guidelines that require officials in line of succession to 
the presidency members of congress and other key officials to 
transfer from ready to standby reserve status 
they may participate in drills and training exercises and 
collect points for retirement pensions but they cannot be paid or 
activated 
rep thomas carper ddel a navy reserve commander and 
decorated flight officer in the vietnam war said he had to get a 
waiver from the chief of naval operations to keep flying and 
maintain his status as a qualified mission commander aboard a p3 
surveillance plane the type of aircraft now tracking merchant 
shipping to and from iraq 
when i was elected in 1982 i learned i could no longer hold a 
mobilization billet even though im a member of a combatready 
patrol squadron carper said 
former rep john o marsh jr a virginia democrat and later 
secretary of the army was the last lawmaker to go to war while 
still holding a seat in congress he was a major in the virginia 
national guard when he volunteered to spend a 30day activeduty 
tour in vietnam during a 1966 congressional christmas recess 
i got on a regular lift just like any other replacement troops 
going over he said only a few people there knew i was a 
member of congress the agreement i had with the chief of staff of 
the army was there would be no publicity 
since the civil war presidents and members of congress alike 
have recognized an inherent conflict in having lawmakers who 
exercise civilian control and oversight of the military 
simultaneously serve under military commanders 
president lincoln prohibited his generals from allowing 
lawmakers to join them in combat after his close friend sen 
edward baker rore crossed the potomac to take part in the 
battle of balls bluff and was killed 
denied a leave of absence for a second tour of duty in world war 
ii republican henry cabot lodge of massachusetts gave up his seat 
in congress in 1944 to join the fighting in europe he had been 
granted one senate leave to serve in 1942 with american tank crews 
in libya 
but after other lawmakers including a thenjunior house 
democrat from texas lyndon johnson demanded cameo appearance 
tours the war department in 1943 stopped activating sitting 
members of congress 
its a pretty basic conflict of interest said senate 
historian richard a baker it was inconveniencing a lot of 
people and there was a big concern that a lot of it was being done 
for political considerations 
there was also the concern that services would use reserve 
promotions to reward legislators for shepherding projects or 
weapons systems through the complex authorization and 
appropriations webs of congress 
i dont think in this day and age that you can serve two 
masters said rep bill mccollum rfla also a navy reserve

iraq in its latest use of trapped foreigners to pressure the

japanese nationals stranded in iraq and occupied kuwait to leave as 
a goodwill gesture 
earlier today iraqi newspapers had warned japan and europe not 
to walk in the steps of washington by helping the multinational 
force deployed to protect iraqs neighbor saudi arabia 
about 731 japanese and 560 french citizens were trapped in iraq 
and kuwait when iraq invaded the emirate on aug2 
meanwhile there were signs today that an escape route for 
thousands of foreigners mainly arab nationals might be 
restricted jordans king hussein said his country is heavily 
burdened by refugees fleeing kuwait and may have to slow down the 
process of receiving them 
we have received within jordan since the beginning of this 
crisis an approximate number of 185000 people of different 
nationalities he told a news conference in amman today 
we are finding enormous difficulty in meeting the needs of 
these people or in arranging adequate modes of transport for them 
to leave jordan 
baghdads latest announcement carried by the official iraqi 
news agency quoted sadi mehdi saleh the speaker of the iraqi 
parliament as saying lawmakers decided to make yet another 
goodwill gesture and allow some french and japanese nationals to 
travel out of iraq 
he did not say how many people the decision involved nor 
elaborate on when exactly they would be allowed to leave 
the move came as western governments renewed their protests over 
iraqi president saddam husseins vow to use trapped foreigners as 
human shields for vital installations in the event of an attack 
foreign secretary douglas hurd of britain today denounced saddam 
as a destructive loser whose hostagetaking reflects his 
isolation the british foreign office said 21 britons are known to 
be held at iraqi military installations 
this human shield policy is not going to work hurd said 
president francois mitterrand of france said the national 
assembly would hold an special session on monday to discuss the 
crisis he alco called the trapped westerners hostages 
when you are told that they may be freed in exchange for a 
political or military benefit they are hostages he said 
there is no need to hide behind semantics 
white house spokesman marlin fitzwater said 18 americans got out 
of kuwait tuesday but there are still 54 americans missing 13 
in kuwait and 41 in iraq more than 3000 americans are among the 
thousands of foreigners who were trapped in iraq and kuwait by the 
iraqi invasion of its oilrich neighbor 
president bush has described the americans as hostages and said 
he would hold iraq responsible for their safety 
on tuesday iraqi authorities told western ambassadors that 
citizens of seven european community nations who are in occupied 
kuwait would be allowed to leave an italian foreign ministry 
official said 
the action would affect citizens of italy belgium spain 
denmark the netherlands ireland and greece the official said 
but the dutch ambassador to iraq denied reports that dutch 
nationals are allowed to leave kuwait the dutch foreign ministry 
said 147 nationals are in iraq and 83 in kuwait 
danish foreign minister uffe ellemannjensen warned that iraqs 
reported willingness to release some european community citizens 
from kuwait could be an attempt to divide western countries who 
support sanctions against iraq and have deployed forces to the 
region 
there are 83 danes stranded in kuwait and 17 in iraq 
irish officials said today they were trying to confirm reports 
that the 50 irish citizens in kuwait would be allowed to leave 
also today iraqis detained about 130 swedes finns and 
austrians at the turkish border after an 800mile trek across the 
desert from kuwait the iraqis said their documents were not in 
order swedish officials said 
the convoy of buses and cars arrived at the border this morning 
after 30 hours of driving across iraq and were still waiting three 
hours later to cross into turkey swedish radio reports said 
the convoy was held up on the iraqi side of the border because 
local officials had not been told that it had permission to leave 
kuwait said larsolaf lundberg a spokesman for the swedish 
foreign ministry 
swedish officials had said tuesday that 250 swedes finns swiss 
and other foreign citizens had been given permission to drive out 
of kuwait 
the status of foreign missions in kuwait too was unclear 
saddam on monday demanded the closing of embassies in kuwait 
city by friday and a foreign ministry spokesman said diplomatic 
personnel who stayed will be treated as ordinary foreign 
nationals 
washington was making contingency plans to reduce the number of 
us diplomats in kuwait but us officials said today they would 
not close the embassy obviously we need to maintain an 
essential presence to take care of american citizens a us 
official told the associated press late tuesday 
there are about 120 us diplomats in kuwait they are concerned 
mainly with keeping track of the 2500 or so americans trapped in 
the emirate since iraqs invasion three weeks ago 
britain and the soviet union already have decided to scale down 
their diplomatic presence in kuwait without ceasing operations 
nine west european nations meeting tuesday in paris rejected 
the ultimatum and asserted their intention to remain open

a widely used epilepsy drug reduces the risk of 
seizures by 73 percent during the first week after a serious head 
injury but is ineffective after that a study concludes 
seizures are a hazard of serious head trauma and doctors 
routinely prescribe the drug dilantin for up to three years after 
the injuries 
however some researchers in recent years have questioned 
whether this treatment works to help resolve these doubts the 
latest study tested dilantin known generically as phenytoin for 
one year 
the study provides convincing evidence of the effectiveness of 
phenytoin in preventing seizures during the first week after 
serious head injury the researchers wrote 
an estimated 500000 americans suffer head trauma that result in 
brain injury each year about 2 percent suffer recurring seizures 
as a result 
the study directed by dr nancy r temkin at the university of 
washington in seattle was published in thursdays new england 
journal of medicine it was financed in part by 
warnerlambertparkdavis which makes dilantin 
in the research people with serious head injuries were randomly 
assigned to take dilantin or placebos 
during the first week 4 percent of those getting dilantin 
suffered seizures compared with 14 percent in the placebo group 
however over the next two years there was no significant 
difference 
in an accompanying editorial in the journal dr w allen hauser 
of columbia university said the study provides answers to 
important questions

first came several kuwaiti refugees 
expressing their gratitude for the hospitality of the saudi 
government 
next came a man involved in a land dispute a short time later 
there was a man seeking help finding medical treatment another 
came to offer a poem 
prince muhammad bin fahd bin abdul aziz the son of king fahd 
and governor of arabias oilrich eastern province had time for 
each of them 
muhammad was holding open court wednesday in his ornate palace 
continuing a tribal tradition of being host to a daily majlis 
complete with a bedouin royal guard 
in saudi arabia even the king is obliged to hold majlis and 
anyone is welcome 
some of those who brought problems or praise to muhammad on 
wednesday wore goldbraided abayas over their anklelength thobes 
the traditional white shirtdresses worn by saudi men other wore 
dingy thobes and tattered sandals 
all got a few minutes of the princes time and his promise to 
look into their concerns 
watching was a horde of reporters from the united states europe 
and japan who listened intently to discussions of local land 
disputes before seeking muhammads view on the larger dispute that 
had brought them there the iraqi invasion of neighboring kuwait 
the kuwaitis he said are welcome in saudi arabia and will be 
housed for free offered medical care and even pocket money if 
necessary 
the kuwaitis are like brothers he said any number are 
welcome in this country 
it is muhammads province which makes up 30 percent of saudi 
arabia and borders kuwait and iraq that will bear the brunt of the 
kuwaiti influx and the thousands of american and other troops 
flooding into the kingdom to defend it and its oil fields 
the eastern province would be the major prize for any invader 
it has the richest oil fields in the world the countrys 
petrochemical and other industries and is home of a sprawling 
ultramodern persian gulf port 
muhammad hopes aloud that economic and political sanctions will 
force iraqs saddam hussein to pull his troops from kuwait 
but if necessary he says saudis are ready to die for their 
country 
saudi arabia will never start war he said we are only 
defending our country 
muhammad said the american and other foreign troops were 
welcome but that he hoped they like the kuwaitis soon would be 
able to head home 
these friendly forces are here for a purpose and when their 
purpose is finished and there is no reason for them to be here they 
will go home muhammad said 
the opening of the majlis to foreign reporters was the latest in 
a series of events this past week that have given the west an 
unprecedented look at the saudi government and society 
the majlis dates to the countrys nomadic tribal days and the 
guidance of the koran that moslems confer among themselves to 
settle disputes and make policy 
there were about 100 people waiting in chairs arranged around 
the huge hall after muhammad entered everyone shook his hand and 
offered greetings those with problems formed a line carrying a 
written explanation of their problem 
muhammad tells the man seeking medical help he will have aides 
look into the matter several men with land disputes including one 
who said he faces fines for building a store without government 
permission get the same response 
with the crowd of journalists circled around him muhammad tells 
the man offering a poem we have no time now 
after the meeting he would rather talk about the local 
government and its traditions than the iraqi forces fewer than 200 
miles to the north and their impact on life in saudi arabia 
when a reporter asks if saudi arabia is likely to move toward a 
democracy muhammad looks around at the local people and says 
this is democracy saudi arabia is improving every year i 
dont think we need to change except for the better

exposure to housedust mites during infancy 
appears to be an important cause of childhood asthma in places 
where the climate is humid yearround a study concludes 
the study conducted in englands soggy south found that babies 
who lived in homes with high levels of dust mites had an especially 
high risk of suffering asthma as they grew older 
the work supports the growing belief that a variety of proteins 
from common household creatures especially cats and cockroaches 
can trigger this frequent childhood illness 
it also suggests that modern home construction including 
insulation and central heating is raising the risk of asthma 
has the modern world gone wrong about house design somewhere 
so we are doing something to make houses more of a risk to 
children asked dr thomas ae plattsmills 
plattsmills a researcher at the university of virginia is a 
coauthor of the study published in thursdays new england journal 
of medicine 
he said that between 4 percent and 8 percent of us youngsters 
have asthma the problem tends to go away as people get older but 
it can remain a lifelong problem 
his study was based on a survey of 67 children in poole 
england researchers check for housedust mites by testing samples 
of dust from their homes 
by age 11 17 children had asthma all but one had been exposed 
to high levels of housedust mites at age 1 
the tiny mites are an unseen but common inhabitant of houses 
everywhere they are especially common in places with humid 
yearround climates plattsmills said that places in the united 
states where they are likely to be a problem include florida 
seattle and galveston texas 
in the study children had an elevated risk if the house dust in 
their homes contained 500 or more mites per gram however houses 
can have high levels of mites and still look perfectly clean 
children whose asthma is triggered by housedust mites are 
allergic to a form of cysteine proteinase a protein found in the 
mites gastrointestinal tracts and droppings 
in house construction plattsmills said the critical 
offenses are carpets central heating and tight housing if you put 
these three together you raise the temperature and if you 
increase the tightness of the house without dehumidification you 
raise humidity and create ideal conditions for microbes 
walltowall carpeting is an especially cozy breeding ground for 
mites he said vacuuming fails to pick up the bugs and their 
droppings shampooing the rugs aggravates the problem by increasing 
dampness 
he offered these tips for holding down levels of the creatures 
wash blankets and pillows every 10 days 
use hot water in washing avoid coldwater detergents which 
fail to kill the mites 
use air conditioning and dehumidifiers to keep humidity below 
50 percent 
dont vacuum rugs when children are in the room because this 
stirs up the mites

the third espionage trial of former fbi agent 
richard w miller began today as the prosecution outlined its case 
against the former hapless agent and his involvement with a married 
soviet emigre 
assistant us attorney adam schiff told the judge in the 
nonjury trial that miller passed a secret document to a woman who 
later pleaded guilty to being a soviet spy 
miller wearing a tan suit over his large frame took notes 
while schiff delivered his opening statement millers two sons 
wearing gray business suits sat among the spectators behind him in 
the courtroom 
a federal judge ruled tuesday that millers statement to his 
boss that he had traded a secret us document for sex and money 
will be allowed into evidence 
at tuesdays pretrial hearing miller the first fbi agent 
convicted of spying said his 1984 confession was false and that he 
simply said what he thought his interrogators wanted to hear 
i wanted to be honest and i wanted to be so honest that the 
statements i made were to the benefit of the fbi i wanted no stone 
unturned miller said 
but later i came to the conclusion that i did not give 
anybody any document he said 
in a defense motion millier claimed as he had before his first 
trial that religion unduly influenced his oct 2 1984 meeting 
with his boss richard bretzing and fellow agent phillip 
christensen 
bretzing who was then in charge of the los angeles office was 
a bishop in the mormon church christensen also is a mormon at the 
time miller had been excommunicated from the church 
according to testimony miller asked the agents for their 
blessing during a break in his interrogation 
i looked to mr christensen and mr bretzing as spiritual 
advisers i looked to them for strength and clarity of all the 
confusion that was in my mind miller said 
but under grilling from schiff miller appeared to contradict 
the defenses contention of undue religious influence 
when you made those statements that you gave documents to a 
soviet spy those admissions had nothing to do with religion did 
they schiff asked 
after a long pause miller answered no 
us district judge robert takasugi refused to suppress the 
admission on tuesday saying he would take into account the 
question of religious influence when he weighs the admission as 
evidence takasugi is hearing the case without a jury 
in two earlier trials miller a 20year veteran of the agency 
was portrayed as a fat bumbler who had an affair with a married 
soviet emigre 
prosecutors said miller now a private investigators assistant 
became bitter and vengeful after repeated fbi reprimands over his 
ballooning weight and inept performance 
they said he was easily recruited as a spy who passed secrets to 
svetlana ogorodnikov in exchange for sex and 65000 in cash and 
gold 
but his lawyers said miller actually wanted to save his career 
by trying to infiltrate the kgb 
miller admits he had an affair with ms ogorodnikov but denies 
ever passing her government secrets ms ogorodnikov and her 
husband nikolay ogorodnikov pleaded guilty to conspiracy to 
commit espionage and were sentenced to prison 
miller was imprisoned for five years before being granted bail 
in october 1989 by the appellate court he was released from prison 
in november 1989 after posting 337000 bail 
the 9th us circuit court of appeals said the jury in the 
second trial wrongly heard about millers lie detector tests

john zaccaro jr has been a model 
probationer and should be released early from probation on a 
cocaineselling conviction his lawyer argued today 
the son of 1984 vice presidential candidate geraldine ferraro 
was convicted two years ago of selling onequarter gram of cocaine 
for 25 to an undercover officer while a student at middlebury 
college in vermont in 1986 
zaccaros attorney charles tetzlaff argued that zaccaro should 
be released from probation early because he is beginning his first

dc and would have to return monthly to new york state which is 
supervising his probation 
the district of columbia wont accept any probation cases unless 
there is less than a year in the term

probation but tetzlaff said that under new york state regulations 
zaccaro would be eligible for release from probation in december 
addison county states attorney john quinn argued that zaccaro

arrested while in a college atmosphere and now he is back in that 
atmosphere 
vermont district judge francis mccaffery made no immediate 
decision on the request to dismiss zaccaro from probation 
zaccaro served three months of his sentence under house arrest

a former top aide to us attorney general 
dick thornburgh pleaded innocent wednesday to drugrelated charges 
that resulted from a federal investigation of alleged drug use by 
public officials 
henry barr who worked for thornburgh at the justice department 
and in harrisburg when thornburgh was pennsylvanias governor is 
apparently the highestranking present or former federal official 
to face drug charges said gordon zubrod the prosecutor in charge 
of the case 
barr pleaded innocent to four counts during a brief hearing 
before us district judge edwin kosik 
barr 47 of suburban harrisburg is charged with one count of 
cocaine possession two counts of lying to federal officials about 
drug use and one count of conspiracy he was indicted earlier this 
month in an investigation that has resulted in guilty pleas from 
two former deputy state prosecutors 
after the hearing zubrod said he expects barrs lawyer to try 
to have the indictment thrown out if that bid is rejected zubrod 
said the case could be heard in october 
zubrod said that while no additional indictments are pending 
the investigation into alleged drug use by other public officials 
remains active last week he gave the impression that the case 
against other officials was closed 
barr and his lawyer charles scarlata refused to comment on the 
case after the hearing 
the indictment accused barr of using cocaine at a suburban 
harrisburg home on april 8 1989 when he was a special assistant 
to the us attorney general 
it also alleges he lied about drug use on a federal form the fbi 
uses to check the backgrounds of people in sensitive jobs and 
repeated the lie in an interview with federal agents 
if convicted on all counts barr could face up to 12 years in 
prison and fines of 510000 
court documents filed in connection with the investigation show 
that barr was implicated by former state deputy attorney general 
richard guida who pleaded guilty last week to one count of cocaine 
distribution 
in a brief filed earlier this summer guidas lawyer paul 
killion noted that his client informed the fbi he had used 
cocaine with henry barr the target of this investigation on new 
years eve of 1984 and on other occasions in 1985 and in 1987 or 
early 1988 
the documents also identify several other people who allegedly 
saw barr use cocaine 
barrs ties to thornburgh extend two decades when barr was a 
federal prosecutor in pittsburgh and thornburgh was the us 
attorney there 
after a stint with the state attorney general in which barr 
successfully prosecuted defendants in a lotteryfix case barr 
served as a top legal aide to thengov thornburgh from 1982 to 
1986 
he followed thornburgh to washington in september 1988 serving 
as the justice departments liaison to the drug enforcement 
administration and other agencies 
barr left the department in may 1989 two days after guida 
learned he was a target of the federal investigation and is now a 
lawyer in private practice 
thornburgh removed himself from the investigation earlier this 
year when he learned that barr was a target

confessed 
we always did crazy things like that ron zero said of the 
antics of the stores latenight stockers wed hang dolls in the 
aisle or put ken and barbie in the barbie house with barbie 
spanking ken

it brings back memories of the invasion of 
panama when american soldiers blared rock music at the vatican 
embassy to drive gen manuel antonio noriega to surrender 
but this time american gis are the target of musical mayhem as a 
convenience store hoagys corner in tillicum 45 miles south of 
seattle plays loud countrywestern music to keep them from 
loitering in its parking lot 
the 24hour store a subsidiary of southland corp which also 
owns 7eleven stores rigged up speakers and last thursday began 
playing a countrywestern radio station around the clock 
rocky ford general manager at the tillicum hoagys corner 
store says the music does a good job of keeping gis from nearby 
camp murray and madigan army hospital from buying beer and food and 
settling down in the parking lot with their car stereos on high 
sometimes 100 or 150 people are there with their radios 
blaring rap music says ford weve never had a problem with 
them in the store its when they get their food to go outside 
with just one weekend under his belt ford says the music 
deterrent has worked some customers complained about the music as 
they entered the store but once theyre inside they listen to 
milder music 
the idea of playing awful music defined as anything that 
people who hang out cant stand came from employees at 
southlands british columbia division in 1985 
now 10 7eleven stores in the vancouver area pipe muzak mood 
music outside because young people go elsewhere rather than listen 
to such alltime favorites as petula clark or perry como said len 
mcgeouch the divisions loss prevention manager 
its not the style the younger generation likes mcgeouch 
said its not bon jovi 
its a backwards way of keeping people away but you could 
turn it around and say its for the kind of people you want to 
attract said leslie ritter marketing manager for muzak the 
seattlebased company that provides the tapes 
but the tillicum store isnt that subtle store managers decided 
to tune in to a countrywestern station because at the volume they 
wanted the mood music got distorted 
other merchants and even nearby residents dont seem to mind or 
at least they havent called to complain 
they play it loud enough so you can hear it all the time 
said susan pidarson assistant manager of a 7eleven store just 
down the highway its really good music

jewish leaders said wednesday a german 
unification treaty must contain a clear statement of responsibility 
for the victims of nazi tyranny 
in recent years jews have warned that younger germans may begin 
to shirk the legacy of nazi germany where 6 million jews were 
murdered 
as the two german nations come closer together jewish leaders 
want the past clearly spelled out in the preamble to the treaty 
linking both states 
we are insisting that becomes part of the unification 
treaty said heinz galinksi chairman of the central council of 
jews in germany that is our demand 
galinski in a statement distributed by his west berlin office 
recalled that he had given a draft paragraph to west german 
chancellor helmut kohl on july 18 
in the draft the 77yearold survivor of the auschwitz 
concentration camp specified german responsibility for the nazi era 
galinski told the associated press he was very disappointed 
when west german interior minister wolfgang schaeuble responded by 
suggesting that the treaty contain general wording about democracy 
peace and human rights 
there was no specific reference to the 12years of nazi rule 
galinski said the nazis came to power in 1933 
schaeuble is leading the west german team negotiating the treaty 
with officials from east berlin 
jewish leaders insist the passage should specify the 
singularity of the nazi era and acknowledge germans 
responsibility to all the victims of hitlers tyranny 
in addition to the jews who died the nazis killed hundreds of 
thousands of gypsies homosexuals and others deemed undesirable by 
the regime 
the treaty is considered of enormous importance to the 
approximately 36000 jews in west germany and the almost 400 
practicing jews in east germany 
with the date of unity racing closer possible east german 
reparations to holocaust victims have been the subject of separate 
talks with jewish leaders for four decades east germanys 
communists refused to pay compensation to jews saying that as an 
antifascist state they were not liable for hitlers crimes 
after the fall of the communists last year the democratically 
elected government in east berlin offered to pay compensation 
but frankfurt jewish community spokesman michel friedman said he 
was pessimistic on the subject of reparations and said he fears the 
matter may be left unresolved until after formal unification

three days after the seabrook nuclear 
plant launched into regular operation the reactor on wednesday had 
its eighth unplanned shutdown since connecting to the regional 
power grid may 29 
the 66 billion reactor was running at 100 percent power when 
the turbine generator prompted an automatic shutdown said plant 
spokesman ron sher 
seabrook began supplying enough electricity for 1 million homes 
sunday after a fivemonth testing program 
all seven shutdowns since the reactor was connected to the new 
england power grid were turbinerelated and the plant was shut down 
for about a month in april for turbine modifications 
todays shutdown occurred during scheduled maintenance 
activities that were taking place on a turbine control system not 
the turbine itself sher said 
seabrook opponents see the shutdowns as confirmation of their 
longheld predictions 
weve been talking about construction problems bad quality 
control for years said sam miller of the clamshell alliance 
the plant took 10 years to complete 19761986 and its 
operating license was delayed until last spring by people 
protesting emergency evacuation plans near the plant

sri lankan troops landed on rebelheld 
jaffna peninsula by ship wednesday and began advancing on a 
government fort that has been besieged by rebels for the past 10 
weeks officials said 
a western diplomat said it was the first movement by government 
troops in six weeks on the peninsula a key stronghold of the rebel 
tamil tigers militia 
the diplomat called the move a significant offensive but 
said government forces were in no position to unleash a knockout 
blow against the rebels the diplomat spoke on condition of 
anonymity 
authorities said ships ferried 750 to 1000 troops to a naval 
base in the north the troops then launched an offensive to relieve 
the garrison trapped in jaffna fort the naval base is about 12 
miles from the 200yearold fort 
jaffna 186 miles northeast of the capital of colombo is the 
headquarters of the liberation tigers of tamil eelam the major 
rebel group fighting for tamil independence from the ethnic 
sinhalesedominated government 
government planes tuesday dropped leaflets on jaffna announcing 
an indefinite curfew and warning the 850000 civilians there that 
the government would mount air strikes against rebel positions 
most civilians on the peninsula are tamils 
the curfew took effect at 600 am wednesday and warplanes 
began bombing runs one hour later said the officials who spoke on 
condition of anonymity 
the bombing apparently was a diversionary tactic while the naval 
vessels landed the troops ashore the officials said 
army commander lt gen hamilton wanasinghe flew to jaffna to 
supervise the operation the military said 
in a statement released by his office deputy defense minister 
ranjan wijeratne assured diplomats there would be no indiscriminate 
bombing of civilians and that any action would be taken only 
after careful intelligence assessment to minimize any loss of 
civilian life 
but a western diplomat said sri lankas small illequipped air 
force has nothing that is able to pound tiger positions with any 
degree of precision 
at least 14000 people have died since the rebels took up arms 
against the government 
the tigers who have accused the government of discrimination 
against ethnic tamils are demanding an independent state in the 
north and east where tamils are most numerous 
tamils who are mostly hindus constitute 18 percent of the 
population of this indian ocean island while sinhalese who are 
mostly buddhist make up 85 percent of the population and dominate 
the military and government 
jaffna fort was surrounded june 11 when the tigers broke a 
13month ceasefire and resumed their sevenyearold civil war 
against the government 
about 250 sri lankan police and soldiers are in the garrison 
which has survived on supplies dropped from highflying aircraft 
it was unclear whether the forces would try to lift the siege or 
whether the fort would be evacuated 
officials said one man in the fort was killed by rebel fire 
tuesday raising the garrisons casualties to nine in the past 
month 
wijeratne briefing colombobased diplomats wednesday said he 
proposed evacuating the fort and handing it over to the 
international committee of the red cross 
he said the red cross agreed to the plan and was waiting for 
authorization from the government to discuss it with the rebels

university square the site of a 
53day antigovernment demonstration that sparked a bloody 
crackdown in june was again occupied by demonstrators wednesday 
about 700 protesters cut off traffic in the square the 
capitals central intersection and pledged not to leave until 
their demands were met 
the new protest began when a governmentsanctioned rally held by 
the democratic christian revolutionary party in nearby union square 
turned into an antigovernment demonstration 
university square was blocked for 53 days by antigovernment 
protesters until midjune when the police moved to clear the 
square in the violence that followed thousands of miners 
responding to a call for help from the government beat protesters 
and passersby and terrorized the capital for two days 
the violence left six people dead according to an official 
count 
demonstrators have since held antigovernment protests in the 
capital but until now they were careful not to disrupt traffic in 
the square 
staterun television reported that bucharest student league 
president marian munteanu an organizer of the previous rally told 
authorities that students were not involved in the current protest 
in june munteanu was beaten by miners and hospitalized then kept 
in preventative detention for six weeks 
on wednesday the demonstrators in the square shouted slogans 
equating president ion iliescu with former communist dictator 
nicolae ceausescu who was deposed and executed in last decembers 
revolution 
wednesday marked eight months to the day that ceausescu fled 
bucharests communist party headquarters by helicopter with his 
wife elena the couple was captured and executed after a summary 
trial on christmas day

evidence that he cannot endure prison conditions the court was 
expected to decide thursday whether to free the younger ceausescu

genocide but the prosecution has largely failed to provide 
concrete evidence that he issued orders to fire at demonstrators

arabamericans say theyve been subjected to 
isolated cases of violence since the middle east crisis began and 
they worry that the antiarab mood could become far worse 
saddam hussein is an international renegade its unfair to 
stereotype all arabs said jawad f george executive director of 
the national association of arab americans arabs are replacing 
the soviet union as the enemy of the united states 
in san francisco a professor received a death threat after 
telling a newspaper he favored a negotiated settlement to the 
crisis an arabamerican newspaper editor in detroit was told in a 
phone call he would be killed if any americans were hurt in kuwait 
cleveland police shouted ethnic slurs at an egyptian grocer and 
jailed him for a night after a minor dispute with youngsters in his 
neighborhood a young palestinian walking in a chicago supermarket 
with his mother was hit and told to go back to iraq 
the los angeles office of the arabamerican antidiscrimination 
committee received obscene phone calls 
whenever there is a crisis in the middle east the 
arabamerican becomes a scapegoat said albert mokhiber the 
committees director of legal services 
mokhiber said the 1985 terrorist attack on the cruise ship 
achille lauro that led to the death of an american passenger was 
followed by the letterbomb murder of prominent arabamerican alex 
odeh 
mosques were attacked after the 1985 hijacking of a twa aircraft 
to beirut bricks were thrown through the windows of 
iranianamericans during the hostage siege in tehran 
the potential for trouble may be far worse in this case than 
anything weve ever seen mokhiber said the entire arab 
community is going to be vilified 
he and other arabamerican leaders said americas 25 million 
people of arab descent already are being negatively linked to iraq 
only 150000 arabamericans are of iraqi origins and many of those 
are refugees from persecution in their homeland 
theres obviously a potential for tarring all arabs with one 
brush said ann joyce of the americanarab affairs council 
anyone in the field sees this as a disaster 
arabamericans say tv comedians radio talk shows and political 
cartoonists are creating an antiarab hysteria by depicting 
ayrabs as ugly hooknosed burnoosedraped sheiks or 
terrorists they are referred to as camel jockeys or 
sandblowers 
one georgia radio station sponsored a towel head contest 
other stations are promoting songs with antiarab lyrics 
jim zogby president of the arabamerican institute said arabs 
have always been depicted in movies as sinister and lacking in 
humanity 
people dont know who we are he said its terribly 
troubling to our community 
khalil barhoum of the san francisco chapter of the 
antidiscrimination committee said threatening phone calls received 
by bay area arabamericans made them realize theres a lot of 
bigotry were all americans and we should have a right to voice 
our opinions 
but many arabamericans are apparently choosing to muffle even 
moderate opinions until the crisis subsides 
theres a feeling of vulnerability a dread fear that if 
shooting begins what is sitting under the surface will rear its 
head rather vehemently zogby said 
detroit home to americas largest arabamerican community of 
250000 has escaped major confrontations thus far 
but theres tension and paranoia and fear said sam baraka 
a palestinian doctor and official of detroits arab chaldean 
council 
its very inflammable here and people dont want to speak 
he said 
enough is enough we are american citizens said one 
washington dc arabamerican woman who declined to give her name 
we dont need to be maligned people say go back where you 
came from but we came from here

pat bryden has performed thousands of 
marriages but wednesdays ceremony was different it was her own 
ms bryden 58 is the marriage registrar at gretna the 
scottish village known worldwide as the place where eloping couples 
crossed the english border to tie the knot 
for her marriage to expoliceman archie smith however she 
chose to walk down the aisle in nearby st andrews church 
although ive married thousands of couples over the years i 
never thought it would happen to me im very very happy said 
the bride who wore a blue suit with a pleated skirt and a pink hat 
about 100 wellwishers greeted the couple outside the church 
which was filled with 200 guests 
i was hoping for a quiet wedding but it wasnt to be pat is 
too wellknown said smith 59 
smiths wife rita died in 1988 and a few weeks later his home 
in the scottish town of lockerbie burned down in the wreckage of 
pan am flight 103 which was blown up in flight by a terrorist 
bomb ms bryden a longtime family friend went to console him 
and his two children and love blossomed 
he needed a lot of support at that time she said i was 
there with him 
changing laws and social mores have made it much easier to marry 
in britain and young lovers no longer arrive breathless with angry 
parents in hot pursuit 
the romantic allure lingers however and gretna still attracts 
some 1400 couples a year making ms bryden one of the worlds 
busiest marriage registrars 
ms bryden who had never married has worked in the gretna 
registry service for about 40 years twenty years ago she was 
authorized to perform marriages and has officiated at about 10000 
her office is in a small building which also houses a dentists 
office and couples sometimes recite their vows to the whine of a 
dentists drill 
from a legal point of view theres nothing special about 
gretna couples could wed just as easily anywhere else in scotland 
but they come here for the romance ms bryden said 
the villages associations with love and marriage ensure their 
wedding will be something different something to remember all 
their lives she said 
gretnas romantic associations date back to 1754 when an act of 
parliament outlawed irregular marriages in england no longer 
could couples simply declare themselves married in front of

russian federation president boris yeltsin on 
wednesday became the first highranking soviet official to tour the 
chain of islands the soviet union seized from japan after world war 
ii 
yeltsin visited kunashir island in the south of the chain known 
to the soviets as the kurils and to the japanese as the northern 
territories 
he stressed the islands should remain under soviet control but 
said they should be demilitarized 
this is a place that doesnt deserve to be given up yeltsin 
said according to an account by the independent news service 
interfax 
the official soviet news agency tass said it was the first time 
in postwar years that a leader of such high rank had visited the 
islands his visit was cut short because of an approaching storm 
soviet president mikhail gorbachev refused to open a dialogue on 
the disputed islands during a meeting last month in moscow with the 
speaker of japans parliament 
the small group of islands stretching north from the northern 
japanese island of hokkaido were seized by soviet troops in the 
last days of world war ii and the dispute has kept japan and the 
soviet union from signing a peace treaty to formally end the war

here is a transcript of president 
bushs news conference wednesday 
president bush let me make a brief opening statement and then 
ill be glad to take any questions 
first secretary cheney and general powell have just given me a 
very full and i would say encouraging briefing on the status of 
our deployment to the persian gulf this has been a very 
complicated mission calling for precision calling for maximum 
coordination with saudi arabia and the other nations providing 
forces the process has gone smoothly and weve now moved what 
amounts to a mediumsized american city completely capable of 
sustaining itself all the way over to the middle east 
and the secretary reports that the men and women in the armed 
forces have performed with extraordinary ability their morale is 
high and theyve accepted the challenge of their mission with 
extraordinary dedication to duty and im very proud of each and 
every single one of them and i want them to know that the american 
people are behind them 100 percent supporting them strongly 
and its also crucial that everyone understand we are not in 
this alone we stand shoulder to shoulder right there in the middle 
east with the armed forces of 22 other nations from the middle 
east from europe and around the world 
secretary dick cheney reports an impressive alliance of 
multinational forces that stands behind the united nations resolve 
that iraq completely and unconditionally withdraw from kuwait with 
the restoration of the legitimate government in that country the 
united nations has provided enormous leadership to the whole world 
community in pursuing this objective and voting the sanctions 
necessary to carrying it out 
and lets be clear as the deployment of the forces of the many 
nations shows and as the votes in the united nations show this is 
not a matter between iraq and the united states of america it is 
between iraq and the entire world community arab and nonarab 
alike all the nations of the world lined up that oppose aggression 
and as our forces continue to arrive they can look forward to 
the support of the finest reserve components in the world we are 
activating those special categories of reservists that are 
essential to completing our mission the united states considers 
its reserve forces to be an integral part of the total military 
command these essential personnel will soon be joining the 
cohesive organization required to support the military operations 
in and around the arabia peninsula and i have the highest 
confidence in their ability to augment the active forces in this 
operation we continue to pursue our objectives with absolute 
determination 
i might add that i talked to the four leaders of congress today 
and i am very pleased that they are giving us the strong support 
they have been speaker foley sen mitchell sen dole 
congressman michel and the world simply cannot waver in its 
opposition to the threat that iraq has placed on the doorstep of 
all nations who cherish freedom and the rule of law 
now what i plan to do is take some questions and then i know 
youll have more questions for secretary cheney and general powell 
and then the discussions that weve had with these two gentlemen 
and with secretary eagleburger and gen scowcroft our chief of 
staff and bob gates will continue for a little while this 
afternoon before they return to washington 
but dick i am very grateful to you for your mission 
successful mission and both to you and colin my sincere thanks 
for the superb leadership you are giving the united states 
military the superb leadership you are showing in working with 
other countries as we pursue these high moral objectives 
q mr president the soviets have voted with us in the security 
council for the economic sanctions but we learned today that they 
have 193 military advisors still advising the iraqi army on how to 
use sovietbuilt weapons against the allied forces do you call 
upon them to pull those people out 
a well i think that frankly id like to see iraq do what is 
civilized and permit foreigners who want to leave leave but im 
not going to comment on that because i dont have this information 
that youre telling me about maybe dick cheney can comment on it 
later 
q sir may i just follow sir 
a yeah 
q youve talked to a least a dozen world leaders right from 
here in the past week and a half have you called president 
gorbachev and will you call president gorbachev for his help in 
the crisis 
a secretary baker talked to foreign minister shevardnadze less 
than two hours ago and we are in close touch with the soviets at 
this point i can say we are getting superb cooperation from the 
soviets there may be some differences 
in fact i think its fair to say weve been discussing some of 
them regarding the timing of certain further un action but i 
have no argument with the way in which they have cooperated and i 
would expect that secretary cheney would agree on that point 
more

<TEXT>
q could i follow on that sir 
a yes yes 
q talking about the un the action that you would hope to 
have the us forces fired across the bow of a ship that then was 
allowed to continue on and is now in yemen why did they not pursue 
that farther do you want to wait until you now have that un 
authority 
a well you know we feel we have all the authority we need 
and the world leaders ive talked to particularly francois 
mitterrand and margaret thatcher agree that we have all the 
authority we need we have been trying and i think prudently so 
to work with other countries around the world and the more 
unanimity we get out of the united nations for example the better 
so we are prepared to intercept shipping but where i stand now 
is im talking to my top advisors here and have been on the phone 
to secretary baker a couple of times in the last two hours talking 
about should the united nations should we give the united nations 
more time to take more productive action and it has taken 
productive action obviously the chapter 7 was a significant step 
so i think weve made clear to the shipping that they can be 
stopped and that we have the forces to stop them right now and i 
believe that gen powell would back me up on what ive just said 
so my question is how much more united nations action is 
required and so im going to continue the discussion asking for 
the advice of my officials here but at this juncture im not 
prepared to say whether were going to insist on un action before 
we go further but i think the record the signal must go out to 
the world that many countries are prepared to fully enforce these 
sanctions and if theres some un action that will help so much 
the better 
q how long will you wait for that un action 
a we havent made a determination i think the signal is out 
there as we pursue certain vessels and clearly have superior have 
the demonstrated ability to board these vessels that we can do it 
so now the question is how much more un action is beneficiary 
benefits this idea of the world staying more closely together and 
i might be prepared to give a little time speaking just for the 
us were only one country there important one though it may be 
in order to get more collective action 
but on the other hand i need more advice in terms of the 
logistics where these ships are what the signal would be if we go 
ahead and take action to stop them which we could confidently do 
q mr president despite demands from the iraqis that the us 
and other countries close their embassies in kuwait and remove all 
their diplomatic personnel the state department announced today 
that the us would not do that why have you decided to take that 
course of action and how can you possibly enforce that 
a because the occupation of iraq is illegal under international 
law and other countries agree totally that we must not take the 
position that this illegal regime can shut down legitimate 
embassies as a result of their aggression thats why 
q but with iraq in military control of kuwait how can you 
possibly hope to enforce that 
a well my view is lets wait and see what happens i dont go 
into these hypothetical questions id like to explain this because 
i know theres a lot of them out there as to what i might not or 
might do under certain circumstances but here i think most 
countries that im aware of and id defer to secretary 
eagleburger would agree that they will not go along with agreeing 
to this kind of affirmation of iraq aggression aggression that has 
been thoroughly condemned by the united nations 
q id like to ask please about your hostage policy you were 
very firm the other day in warning saddam not to harm the 
americans but i wonder as commander in chief sir do you 
consider the us has been provoked right now 
a consider what 
q has it been provoked has the united states been provoked now 
a i dont think its a question of the united states i think 
its a question of the whole world is being provoked by this 
illegal action outrageous action 
q do you have a plan for getting 
a i dont discuss hypothetical contingencies 
but i would reiterate it is of grave concern to all the 
countries whose leaders ive talked to 
q mr president 
a yeah 
q will the united states give safe haven to our citizens in 
kuwait and iraq if in the embassies if 
a if citizens came to the embassy seeking support and help 
clearly we would do that

q do you have plans to draw down the number of americans in our 
embassy in kuwait 
a id like to defer that question to secretary eagleburger when 
i continue this there has been talk of it indeed i think were 
talking about taking down some personnel but id like to ask him 
to be a little more definitive 
q mr president how constrained do you feel by the americans 
trapped in kuwait as you make your decisions 
a how 
q how constrained do you feel as you make your decisions by the 
plight of the americans in iraq and 
a i think any decisionmaker in the united states or in any of 
these countries is concerned about the lives of innocent civilians 
innocent people and so you weigh that very thoroughly against your 
actions having said that international law in this case the 
chapter 7 sanctions must be enforced 
q mr president you said last wednesday at the pentagon that 
part of what were fighting for standing for in the desert is our 
way of life part of our way of life is heavy usage of energy much 
more so than any other industrialized country we havent really 
heard you call upon americans to conserve as part of this crisis 
a i call upon americans to conserve 
q do you want to elaborate 
a no i think we ought to conserve in times like this on the 
other hand were doing everything we can to guarantee that we 
dont panic americans and that there will be an adequate supply of 
hydrocarbons but i think it is a good time to conserve so im 
glad you reminded me of that and i would call upon americans to 
conserve and i think that doesnt mean that life screeches to a 
halt and therefore i would say that but i also think that were 
going to be able to guarantee an adequate supply of petroleum 
q mr president how many reserves are going to be called up as 
a first step 
a i will defer that question to secretary cheney 
q mr president do you sense any frustration or even 
desperation in the recent statements weve been hearing out of iraq 
a i certainly sense a sense of isolation i think the urgency 
in these statements and the high immoderate tone is due to 
worldwide isolation 
and i think thats very clear and i think hes trying to whip up 
support and make this iraq versus the united states indeed it is 
iraq versus the rest of the world and i talked to leader after 
leader after leader talked at length to helmut kohl today and 
hes been making just that point and will continue to make that 
point 
but yes i think there is some of that feeling that as they 
become isolated from their arab brothers and they are and as 
they become isolated from traditional trading partners and they 
are there is a sense of irrational urgency there 
q how seriously do you take his public threats 
a the united states wont be threatened 
q mr president the other day you called on americans for 
personal sacrifice but you didnt really elaborate were you 
talking about economic deprivation or were you 
a no i was not particularly talking about economic 
deprivation im think of families whose plans have been severely 
altered by this im thinking of more of that kind of thing when i 
made the statement 
q are you preparing americans for the possibility of war and 
american deaths 
a i think any time you move american forces and any time you 
are up against what most of the world now considers to be an 
outrageous violator of international law that the best thing is to 
be prepared 
q mr president king hussein today in jordan suggested that 
perhaps you moved too precipitously in his words that if there 
had not been this buildup that we might not be in the situation 
were in and that saddam hussein might have withdrawn was there 
ever any signals anything that suggested that that might have been 
in the case 
a no and the king regrettably did not have much support in 
the arab world for that position you recall the vote at the arab 
summit he certainly had no support for that position in the united 
nations and as the united nations moved toward chapter 7 
and i would simply remind people who hear that allegation that 
it isnt just the united states its the rest of the world but 
when we are invited by a friend to help defend it against 
aggression that has recently taken place and that threatens to take 
place again were going to respond and thats a good signal to 
send to friends around the world 
and i might say the request for support was not taken without 
reason the saudis were very much concerned and let me just 
recite the history for the american people here he had said 
saddam hussein had said were withdrawing i believe it was on 
a sunday and they had a picture of one truck people frantically 
waving goodbye to the beloved brothers in kuwait as they went north 
and at the same time there was truckload after truckload of 
armor and mechanized equipment moving south 
now were not dumb when we see that nor are the saudis nor 
are the other countries that are rejoicing as dick cheney will 
tell you in the fact that we moved but i think its important to 
keep reminding people of why the saudis felt threatened and 
probably today still feel threatened

iraq claimed two unidentified aircraft 
crossed from saudi arabia into iraqi territory on wednesday and 
violated its airspace 
iraqs official news agency quoted an unidentified military 
spokesman as saying two aircraft coming from saudi arabia 
penetrated the southern iraqi border and ranged some five 
kilometers three miles in iraqi airspace 
the spokesman did not identify the planes nor say whether they 
were military aircraft but iraqs military spokesmen normally 
report only on military activities 
us military forces including aircraft and thousands of 
personnel have been in saudi arabia since iraqs aug 2 invasion 
of kuwait 
the iraqi spokesman said the overflight was reported at 1104 
am wednesday he said the planes flew at an altitude of 36000 
feet with their speed reported at 435 mph 
in his short statement to the agency monitored in nicosia the 
spokesman did not say if the aircraft turned away voluntarily or 
were chased away by iraqs air defenses or air force jets 
it also could not be determined if the spokesman was referring 
to a penetration of iraqs own southern border with saudi arabia or 
that of kuwait iraq says kuwait is now part of iraq after its 
invasion and subsequent annexation 
no other details were immediately available 
last week iraq protested to the ankara government the alleged 
violation of iraqs northern airspace by two turkish planes

the racially motivated slaying of a black teenager by a mob of 
young whites 
john vento 21 who was supposed to be the prosecutions star 
witness until he backed out of a deal to cooperate was convicted 
july 3 on two counts of unlawful imprisonment and four counts of 
menacing hes been in jail since march when he surrendered to fbi 
agents in ohio 
after nine days of bitter deliberations that followed a weeklong 
trial a jury acquitted vento of the most serious charge 
intentional murder but deadlocked over a second murder count and 
a riot charge 
following the trial vento also was charged with seconddegree 
manslaughter 
justice thaddeus owens set a sept 17 trial date on the 
unresolved charges vento is to be tried with a codefendant 
charles stressler whos also charged with seconddegree murder 
four other whites are to be tried later in connection with the

iraqs radar systems described by one expert as a 
sophisticated mishmash from all over could pose the first 
serious challenge to us stealth aircraft military analysts said 
wednesday 
the us air force sent 22 f117a stealth fighters to the middle 
east monday and experts said that even with the highly 
sophisticated air armada assembling in the gulf they could play an 
important role 
stealth is a new system and it would be folly not to take 
the opportunity to use it under operational conditions said don 
kerr an aviation analyst with the international institute for 
strategic studies 
the ungainly matte black jets designed to penetrate radar 
without detection have seen combat only once during the us 
invasion of panama in december 1989 
les aspin chairman of the house of representatives armed 
services committee dismissed the use of the hightech 
fighterbomber in panama as a pentagon ploy to win support for the 
expensive aircraft in congress 
one stealth plane in panama dropped its bombs on a hill instead 
of its intended target but a defense department investigation 
concluded the accident was caused by human error 
air force col anthony tolin until recently a stealth wing 
commander said this week that the presence of the f117a stealth 
planes in the gulf could be an important psychological weapon 
tolin is now assistant deputy chief of staff of the tactical air 
command at langley air force base in virginia 
but stealth would face an iraqi air defense system that military 
analysts in london described as costly and uptodate 
iraqs radar equipment is a mishmash from all over mostly 
from the soviet union but some from france and china said henry 
dodds an aviation specialist with janes defense weekly 
dodds who endorsed the us decision to deploy stealth said 
iraqi radar and air defense systems worked well during the 
eightyear war with iran but he said the iranian air force is 
small poorly trained and inexperienced 
the americans are a very different matter i suspect the 
iraqis have never come up against electronic warfare before said 
kerr 
he said however western forces should not be overconfident 
its not a question of sophistication what you have to 
remember in military matters is that the enemy only has to get 
lucky once kerr said 
the f117a stealth fighters were built by lockheed co at a 
secret plant in burbank ca 
at 426 million per plane not including research and 
development costs the fighters are one of the worlds most 
expensive the us air force says it has 56 of them 
the stealth will operate alongside an impressive array of 
fighter aircraft carrying some of the worlds most sophisticated 
electronic warfare equipment 
the us military buildup in the middle east includes 48 f15 
fighters an unspecified number of b52 bombers airborne warning 
and control system radar planes f16 fighters a10 attack jets 
and reconnaissance aircraft 
carrierbased air power totals at least 100 planes while the 
marines are taking 150 aircraft including harrier vertical takeoff 
fighters and a6e intruder bombers of the type used to attack libya 
in 1986

president bush ordered the first mobilization 
of reservists since the vietnam war on wednesday declaring the 
parttime soldiers essential to completing our mission of 
opposing iraqs saddam hussein in the middle east 
officials said as many as 40000 weekend warriors could be 
in uniform by the end of the month 
we continue to pursue our objectives with absolute 
determination bush said of the persian gulf buildup he spoke 
at a news conference at his vacation home in kennebunkport maine 
after signing the order for the pentagon to call up reservists 
officials declined to identify units that would be activated or 
to say when they would be called but army sources said some could 
be called up within 24 hours of bushs order 
defense secretary dick cheney appearing alongside bush after 
returning from a sixcountry trip to the persian gulf said he 
would decide exactly how many reserves to call up after he meets 
with the military service chiefs thursday 
in a further sign of the scope of the us military buildup 
bush also authorized cheney to extend enlistment terms of 
servicemen the pentagon said it had no immediate comment on how or 
when it might use that authority 
the callup won quick support from the chairmen of the armed 
services committees in both the house and senate 
rep les aspin dwis called it an appropriate and essential 
act and sen sam nunn dga said the action would give 
military planners greater confidence in the availability of 
reserves in future contingencies 
the last time reserves were activated for military purposes was 
1968 when 35280 were called up by president johnson following the 
tet offensive in vietnam and the north korean seizure of the us 
surveillance ship pueblo in 1970 president nixon ordered a callup 
during a mail strike 
bush meeting with cheney and colin powell chairman of the 
joint chiefs of staff at kennebunkport signed an executive order 
that stated 
i hereby determine that it is necessary to augment the active 
armed forces of the united states for the effective conduct of 
operational missions in and around the arabian peninsula 
cheney and powell had been expected to report to him that the 
united states was approaching a target of 100000 military 
personnel in the region said one source speaking on condition of 
anonymity 
presidential press secretary marlin fitzwater said in a 
statement that the actual number of reserve personnel to be 
called to active duty will depend upon the operational needs of the 
armed forces in the gulf area 
while not saying which reserve skills bush wanted to tap 
fitzwater noted that the reserves are an integral part of military 
airlift food and water handling surface transportation cargo 
handling medical services construction and intelligence 
a pentagon statement said some reserves called to active duty 
would be shipped to saudi arabia while others would remain on us 
shores replacing troops already dispatched to the mideast 
these reservists will support operation desert shield by 
joining active duty units deployed in and around the arabian 
peninsula or by filling critical military support vacancies in the 
united states or elsewhere the statement said 
an administration official said the pentagon expected to call up 
40000 reservists between now and the end of august 
short of declaring a national emergency the president can 
mobilize up to 200000 of the nations 12 million reservists for 
as long as 180 days it is up to the pentagon to determine how the 
total is divided among services 
at this time we do not anticipate approaching the full 200000 
authority provided by law fitzwater said 
while taking reservists from their normal jobs may be 
disruptive the pentagon statement said what must be emphasized 
is that those who have been ordered to active duty are vital to our 
national commitment in this operation 
the call to arms for americas civilian militia is the first 
real test of the pentagons ability to field an effective fighting 
force since it began shifting more wartime responsibility to the 
reserves 17 years ago 
after the draft was abolished in 1973 the pentagon adopted a 
total force concept that moved many key tasks such as supply 
transport medical services and communications away from the 
professional soldiers to parttime civilian reservists 
the change was designed to ensure that no sustained conflict 
would be fought without the use of reserves the idea was that 
following the publicly unpopular vietnam war the white house would 
be forced to measure national resolve early in any future military 
crisis by bringing civilians into the fighting force 
reserves also are cheaper than active duty forces 
with the moneysaving element in mind many in congress have 
urged that even more warfighting responsibility be shifted to the 
reserves as the united states shrinks and restructures its armed 
forces in response to the end of the cold war 
reserves are now integral to any largescale military operation 
for example more than half of the armys combat forces and 
twothirds of its combat support and service support manpower are 
in the army national guard and army reserve 
the navy reserve maintains 93 percent of naval cargo handling 
battalions and the air force relies on reserves to man 92 percent 
of strategic interceptor aircraft in the continental united states 
and twothirds of its medical evacuation crews

for the fourth time a citywide police dragnet 
was being deployed in hopes of snaring the socalled zodiac gunman 
three previous dragnets failed to catch the gunman who killed 
one man and wounded three others in predawn attacks between march 
8 and june 21 
i dont know whether we scared him off chief of detectives 
joseph borrelli said during a briefing tuesday at police 
headquarters 
hes not a fool the chief said of the gunman he has to 
assume that we have taken certain extraordinary measures in certain 
particular areas he didnt want to get caught so he went someplace 
else 
the fourth dragnet was in anticipation of a possible attack 
thursday the gunman in the past has attacked on thursdays at 
intervals of 21 or 63 days 
the elusive gunman had vowed in rambling letters to police and 
the media to shoot eight others claiming a victim for each of the 
12 astrological signs so far his victims have been a scorpio a 
taurus a gemini and a cancer 
thursday was considered a key night by a task force of 50 
detectives because it was 63 days from the gunmans last attack 
june 21 it also could be significant because the astrological sign 
of virgo begins thursday 
detectives on the zodiac task force have followed up on nearly 
2000 leads and eliminated about a dozen suspects each of the 
three dragnets has cost the city 25000 in overtime 
investigators have even checked fingerprints from the city 
morgue against two partial prints found on the gunmans letters in 
an effort to determine whether the gunman had died 
if the gunman eludes the dragnet again the task force may be 
reduced borrelli said 
the gunman claims to be the same zodiac who terrorized san 
francisco during the late 1960s and the early 70s killing six 
people police doubt that but think he may be getting his ideas 
from a book about the san francisco attacks

jordan strained by the daily influx of 
thousands of refugees fleeing from iraq and occupied kuwait 
announced wednesday the closure of its northeastern border 
the announcement of the midnight closure 5 pm edt of 
jordans border with iraq came shortly after king hussein said 
42000 foreigners escaping iraq and kuwait crossed into jordan 
during the day that is the largest number since the persian gulf 
crisis began aug 2 with iraqs invasion of kuwait 
the announcement from interior minister salem msadeh said the 
border was being closed because of concern for the health 
situation of the arrivals and to ensure suitable arrangements for 
their stay in jordan 
until we provide them with suitable shelter we find ourselves 
obliged to close the jordanian border for the foreign arrivals from 
iraq as of midnight wednesday 
transportation here is limited and people jam air terminals 
the port and highways mosques hospitals schools and other public 
buildings have been pressed into makeshift accomodations for the 
masses many of whom were left penniless when kuwaiti banks 
suddenly closed after the takeover 
jordans hussein said earlier wednesday that his country may 
have to slow down the process of receiving them because of the 
strain the influx is causing 
hussein said during a news conference that about 185000 people 
of various nationalities have flooded the kingdom the last three 
weeks 
a senior security official said jordan has asked iraq to 
decrease the flow of people the official said most of the refugees 
had entered jordan through the ruweishid border post 210 miles 
northeast of the capital amman 
many are driven across jordan in bus and truck convoys escorted 
by police to the syrian or saudi border the same day of their 
arrival others leave through charter flights from ammans two 
airports 
egyptians are the largest single group of foreigners fleeing 
kuwait and iraq though 54000 egyptians have already passed 
through jordan more than 25000 have been stuck in the bottleneck 
of their only exit point jordans red sea port of aqaba

unlike many other events that have briefly 
depressed wall streets markets in recent years the showdown in 
the persian gulf keeps driving down stock prices weeks after it 
first hit the headlines 
one reason for this persistence analysts say is its timing 
when iraq invaded kuwait the news intensified recession worries 
that were already mounting fast in the financial world 
a second more emotional factor has been the unhappy memories 
the crisis has evoked of the dreary investment climate that 
prevailed for so long in the 1970s when trouble erupted in the 
middle east 
as measured by the dow jones average of 30 industrials the 
stock market topped out at a record closing high of 299975 in 
midjuly more than two weeks before iraq pulled off its surprise 
attack aug 2 
from that peak through wednesdays close the average fell 
43960 points or 146 percent to its lowest level in more than 
six months 
through late july the market dropped as economists debated 
whether a muchheralded soft landing in business activity was 
turning into something more disruptive 
when the hostilities flared in kuwait sending oil prices 
soaring a good many analysts who had taken the norecession 
view began to switch sides 
iraq caught both us and the world totally off guard in its 
kuwaiti invasion observes edward nicoski at the minneapolis 
investment firm of piper jaffray amp hopwood inc yet the storm 
clouds were hovering weeks earlier over wall street 
it is interesting how the market can foreshadow reallife 
events 
among all the numbers that dictate the moods of wall street the 
most dramatic change has been in the price of oil from around 16 
a barrel at the beginning of the summer to more than 31 as of 
wednesday 
this surge dashed investors hopes that the federal reserve 
would see enough encouraging evidence on inflation to justify 
adopting a stimulative monetary policy that would foster lower 
interest rates 
it also conjured up visions of stagflation a term coined 
in the 1970s to describe a combination of high inflation and 
stagnant economic activity 
in some schools of economic thought these two problems were 
once considered almost mutually exclusive but they came together 
in the oil shocks of both 1973 and 1979 
those conditions in turn bore a large share of the blame for a 
generally poor performance by the stock market throughout the 70s 
the markets woes grew especially acute in the fall of 1973 
when members of the organization of petroleum exporting countries 
declared an embargo on oil shipments to the united states 
over a span of less than two months from oct 12 through dec 5 
of that year the dow jones industrial average fell from 97863 to 
78831 or 195 percent further sharp declines followed in a bear 
market that lasted for another year 
many economists have hastened to declare that todays situation 
differs greatly from the setting in which those events unfolded 
for one thing they say industrial countries have markedly reduced 
their relative reliance on oil to fuel their economies 
for another world politics have changed dramatically so that a 
nation such as iraq in a militant position cannot readily play 
communist and capitalist powers off against each other the way it 
once might have done 
nevertheless say some analysts the stock market cares most 
about economics and it is now groping for a new level that 
reflects a gloomier outlook for investors consumers workers and 
business planners 
the economy continues to limp along the edges of recession 
said david resler chief economist at nomura securities 
international in new york 
the mideast crisis and all its ramifications reinforced the 
emerging consensus that things are more likely to get worse before 
they get better

king hussein warned wednesday that any 
escalation of persian gulf conflict could have a devastating 
effect and said he will embark on a new round of talks with arab 
leaders to defuse it 
i still believe there is a chance to resolve the problem 
hussein said at a news conference 
the king also told reporters the flood of refugees entering 
kuwait from iraq and kuwait had severely strained jordans 
resources hours later jordan announced that because of the 
influx it was closing its northeastern border with iraq shutting 
one of the few escape routes left for foreigners fleeing that 
country 
the closure took effect at midnight 5 pm edt according to a 
government announcement 
hussein hinted at the closure during his news conference saying 
the influx of refugees since iraqs aug 2 invasion of kuwait was 
so great jordan may have to slow the process 
speaking in the palace to a room crowded with journalists 
hussein said he believed we are almost facing a crisis of the 
world gone mad he declined to say where he would go or with whom 
he would meet when he begins his new peace mission 
published reports say the kings position revolves around three 
principles iraqi withdrawal from kuwait restoration of the 
kuwaiti ruling family to power and negotiations in an arab 
context to resolve the iraqkuwait dispute 
about 200 jordanian women carrying banners and singing patriotic 
songs marched on the us embassy on wednesday demanding the 
united states withdraw its troops from saudi arabia and lift the 
economic embargo on iraq 
such protests an almost daily occurrence in jordan reflect the 
predominantly proiraqi feeling of jordanians half of whom are 
either of palestinian origin or from the israelioccupied west bank 
and gaza strip 
in part because of popular sentiment in favor of iraq king 
hussein has still not committed himself fully to upholding un 
sanctions against iraq 
another consideration is that jordan depends heavily on trade 
with its neighbor through the red sea port at aqaba sanctions 
would add to the kingdoms economic woes 
asked whether he was siding with his close ally iraq or with 
the united states in the conflict he said my country is not 
siding with anyone but itself and with the arab people and its 
hopes and aspirations 
any escalation of the conflict would have a devastating effect 
on this region and the world he said 
the king added that he did not believe iraq planned further 
expansion 
i believe that as far as you can tell iraq is holding a fully 
defensive posture and i have the impression that the arab forces 
arrayed against iraq in the area are in a defensive posture 
hussein said 
hussein said his country was seeking to clarify with the united 
nations what trade with iraq is barred by the un resolution 
ordering sanctions against iraq 
there is an area of ambiguity that we have been trying to 
clarify with the un as to what an embargo means what is 
permitted to flow and what is not permitted to flow and hopefully 
this will be clarified he said 
pressed by reporters about what trade might be conducted under 
the sanctions he replied i dont know medicines 
foodstuffs these details are not clear

salvadoran government and guerrilla 
negotiators ended six days of unmediated peace talks on 
wednesday deadlocked in what one participant called a dialogue of 
the deaf over the future of the military 
each side accused the other of intransigence 
rebel chiefs said the stalemate made escalation of the war 
imminent 
another round was set for sept 13 in san jose 
the two sides agreed this year to pursue accords permitting a 
midseptember ceasefire un mediator alvaro desoto acknowledged 
as delegation members did earlier that absence of agreement here 
made that virtually impossible 
rebel delegate salvador samayoa said escalation of military 
action is almost inevitable as a result of the governments 
intransigence and the absence of progress 
were speaking two different languages it is a dialogue of 
the deaf francisco mena a senior guerrilla field commander 
said the picture is this were getting nowhere in negotiations 
so lets have at it with the irons 
the farabundo marti national liberation front the insurgent 
army known as the fmln submitted an 18point document the first 
demand is for total demilitarization of society by means of 
disappearance of the two armies 
the conservative administration of president alfredo cristiani 
backed by the united states says it is willing to restructure 
reform and reduce the armed forces but not to abolish them 
justice minister oscar santamaria the chief government 
delegate characterized the rebel position expressed in san jose as 
a setback from the position advanced last month 
army col mauricio vargas also a government negotiator termed 
the new document a low blow 
the nearly 11yearold civil war has killed an estimated 72000 
people most of them civilians 
the fmln insists that military impunity for widespread violation 
of human rights end international rights organizations have blamed 
the military and militarylinked death squads in the deaths of up 
to 30000 suspected opponents in the past 10 years but not one 
officer has been tried for such a crime 
the rebels demand a purge of the high command to ensure 
subordination to civilian authority and guard against abuses by a 
reformed security force 
the fmln proposes that a civilianled police force be created to 
take the place of the army following the lead of costa rica 
costa rica abolished its army in 1949 it is the only central 
american land that has enjoyed peace relative prosperity and 
democracy in recent decades 
in previous talks the rebels demanded trial and punishment of 
officers implicated in four notorious human rights cases including 
the 1980 assassination of archbishop oscar romero and last 
novembers massacre by soldiers of six jesuit priesteducators 
their housekeeper and her daughter 
the new document adds demands for punishment of those 
responsible for two other cases and for murders massacres and 
bombardments of civilians that have occurred during the 
negotiation it seeks investigations to determine responsibility 
for 20 other specific crimes in addition to all the crimes 
murders disappearances and massacres committed since 1979 
our position may appear to be maximalist but this is what is 
needed to create a new society said mena a former army captain 
who switched sides in 1981 
the rebels last november launched the wars biggest offensive 
and say they are prepared to make another major military push 
rebel sources speaking on condition of anonymity say they are now 
better prepared to counter government air power because they have 
acquired dozens of antiaircraft missiles 
the insurgents say they bought the missiles on the black market 
army and western intelligence sources suspect at least some of the 
missiles were provided by sandinista military commanders in 
nicaragua or donated by cuba 
this was the fourth round of talks that began in venezuela in 
may negotiations to date produced one accord on human rights 
signed last month

soviet military experts continue to train iraqi 
soldiers to use their sovietbuilt weapons three weeks after moscow 
cut weapons supplies to protest the invasion of kuwait officials 
said wednesday 
the revelation appeared to open cracks in what had been 
unprecedented ussoviet unity in the 3weekold persian gulf 
crisis 
col valentin ogurtsov said 193 unarmed military experts were 
finishing their contractual obligations to show iraqis how to 
use stateofthe art tanks jet fighters and missiles and to 
maintain and repair the hardware 
ogurtsov and foreign ministry spokesman yuri gremitskikh 
insisted the experts were not advising president saddam husseins 
government and were not involved in military operations 
since iraqs aug 2 invasion of kuwait gremitskikh has 
maintained he did not know what the military experts were doing in 
the arab nation 
confirmation they were still working came only hours after 
soviet prime minister nikolai ryzhkov ordered all soviet agencies 
to sever commercial ties with iraq to comply with un sanctions 
the soviet union sold more than half the weapons baghdad bought 
between 1982 and 1989 
the day after the invasion of kuwait the soviet union halted 
arms supplies to iraq its longtime ally and ogurtsov said 
wednesday one shipment was stopped in transit on the same day 
foreign minister eduard shevardnadze and secretary of state james 
a baker iii signed a rare joint statement condemning iraqs attack 
on its oilrich neighbor 
but the revelations wednesday and reports from the united 
nations that the soviets were slowing efforts to get un approval 
for military force to enforce economic sanctions appeared to 
undercut the initial appearance of unity 
at a news conference in kennebunkport maine president bush 
said he was not familiar with the report on the soviet military 
advisers he said he had no argument with the soviet response to 
the persian gulf crisis at this point i would say we are 
getting superb cooperation from the soviets bush said 
in moscow meanwhile gremitskikh and ogurtsov fended off 
questions for more than an hour about whether the military experts 
continuing work violated the un economic embargo or the soviet 
order 
dont single out the soviet union gremitskikh said i 
dont think this presence of a very small number of military and 
technical experts runs counter to the united nations 
position 
he said nationals from other countries continued to work in iraq 
but did not identify their professions or their countries 
gremitskikh said that when the contracts expire the military 
experts will leave and will not be replaced ogurtsov said the 
contracts ranged from 10 days to one year 
the colonel said that when the soviet government contracted to 
sell weapons to iraq it also agreed we would send technical 
experts to help the iraqi military to learn how to use the arms 
supplied 
we supply the new type of weapons and if the local personnel 
is not acquainted with such a weapon our expert goes there and 
teaches the method of using that type of weapon he said 
at the present time they work not only in training centers 
but on test ranges suppose we supplied a new type of tank it has 
new unknown capabilities to the local personnel so we build a 
kind of test range to test it this is the kind of activity 
they are involved in 
ogurtsov asked why military experts were not recalled as part 
of the soviet arms embargo said its not for me to say the 
decisions are taken not by us but at the political level 
the military experts were among 7791 soviets stranded in iraq 
which closed its borders after the invasion in all 21000 
foreigners were caught in iraq and kuwait including 3000

rep newt gingrich the no 2 house 
republican parted with the bush administration wednesday in saying 
he will propose a taxcut package when budget talks resume next 
month 
gingrich renewed his criticism of the idea of raising some taxes 
to fight the federal deficit a concept president bush accepted 
last june in a reversal of his oftrepeated opposition to new taxes 
gingrich rga said that with a weakening us economy 
threatened even further by the persian gulf crisis the priority 
for budget bargainers should be to adopt policies that would help 
the country avoid a recession 
id find it very hard to understand an argument for a tax 
increase in the face of a weak economy gingrich told reporters 
he said that tax cuts stimulating the economy must be part of any 
deficitreduction package 
gingrich one of the budget negotiators also criticized 
democrats in general and senate majority leader george mitchell 
dmaine in particular in connection with the budget talks 
he cited democratic failure to propose a deficitreduction plan 
at this years budget negotiations and the opposition of many 
democratic lawmakers to bushs effort to cut the capital gains tax 
rate 
theyre following a strategy of taking the risk that americans 
will be put out of work for the political advantage of the 
democratic party gingrich said 
he said there is now a danger of a recession which frankly i 
believe senator mitchell has frankly been planning for and which i 
think his behavior has clearly helped lead to 
a spokeswoman for mitchell declined to comment on gingrichs 
remarks 
white house officials and congressional leaders have been trying 
to hammer out a package of 50 billion in tax increases and 
spending cuts for next year and 500 billion over five years 
their negotiations which started in may have produced no 
agreements the bargainers plan to resume their efforts as congress 
returns from recess next month 
gingrich said he was considering a package of tax cuts worth 
perhaps 10 billion to 15 billion that he will propose when budget 
talks resume next month 
it will be clearly dramatically less expensive than a 
recession gingrich said of the taxcut package 
he said the proposal may include reducing the capital gains tax 
rate providing tax breaks for firsttime home buyers and 
dramatically boosting the personal exemption allowed on income tax 
he is also considering proposing cutting the social security 
payroll tax setting up new iras and providing more tax breaks for 
manufacturers he said 
the lawmaker said he was discussing his plan with other 
republicans and with the white house

marchers clad in skimpy lingerie marched 
through the capital wednesday demanding the city be declared an 
erotic play zone free of repressive laws requiring clothing 
carrying with banners bearing slogans such as lace makes men 
sexy the 12 men and three women marchers shouted bodies are 
beautiful and look whos wearing costumes here 
parade organizer fred wagforth dressed in white panties a 
garter and fishnet stockings urged the 400 spectators to take 
off their clothes and be all genders now 
society creates authoritarian dualism between males and 
females we want to experiment with gender roles and open up new 
terrain for ourselves wagforth said 
a lingerie liberator clad in a womens slip and lace jacket 
challenged men in the audience to prove they werent wearing mens 
underwear by taking off their pants 
a spectator moved by wagforths statement stripped to his 
underwear and joined the throng saying marching would allow him to 
get a better tan 
i think its a fun idea i think people are afraid of their 
bodies don peterson said 
besides the demand for an erotic zone wagforth told city 
officials that police should carry sexual accessories rather than 
weapons 
people need to stop the repressive institution of democracy in 
america wagforth said 
two men one dressed in a womens bra and panties and another in 
a lace outfit led the march carrying a sign that said march for 
erotic action take your desires for reality 
about 20 police officers monitored the event directing traffic 
and following the group as they marched on the sidewalks and 
shouted to observers to take off their clothes and join them a few 
people snapped pictures as the group passed 
duane tessmer who watched from the sidelines said he thought 
the group had a statement to make but were going about it the 
wrong way 
theyre screwed up theyre doing this for their own greed of 
walking around in clothes like that he said

donnita cole knows how to wait 
she has acquired the art of patience through three decades of 
fearing for her husband an overseas oil worker familiar with 
quamires like the one that has trapped him in the middle east 
since the 1960s john cole of odessa texas has endured a coup 
in libya an attempted coup in indonesia two nigerian revolutions 
and one in iran 
now the 50yearold employee of houstonbased oge drilling co 
is among about 3000 us citizens detained three weeks after 
iraqs saddam hussein invaded kuwait on aug 2 
the persian gulf crisis is for the cole family yet another in a 
string of crises 
hes not an adventurer hes just trying to make the best 
living he knows how to for me and the kids mrs cole 48 said 
in a telephone interview wednesday from odessa 
and theres more while mrs cole is wearing a yellow ribbon for 
her missing husband she is also flying an american flag in front 
of her home as a reminder of family members on military standby 
her 22yearold twin sons both army combat specialists and a 
soninlaw with the air force are waiting to find out whether 
theyll be sent to the gulf one of the sons whose names mrs cole 
wont reveal was sent with the us troops to panama in december 
weve never really thought about it but we have not led a 
dull life mrs cole said but as far as going out and looking 
for excitement we havent its just that its happened to us 
during the iranian revolution cole escaped from an offshore rig 
by boat and ended up in bahrain mrs cole who was living in 
malta spent nine days without word from her husband listening to 
tales of atrocities from fleeing refugees 
that decadeold experience helped prepare her for this one she 
said 
it hasnt made it easier but its helping me handle it 
better it is never easy to handle anything like this she said 
you learn how to wait and i am not a patient person not at 
all 
mrs cole was planning to join her husband in kuwait aug 15 
instead she is waiting for news from her husband a network of 
families with relatives either deployed or held in the middle east 
are helping her sort through fears both as a hostages wife and as 
a military mother 
i think two different sets of thoughts sometimes they fit 
together and sometimes they dont she said 
but for now she said the whole family is focusing on seeing 
john cole come home she said even one of her two daughters whose 
husband is on standby in the air force is preoccupied first with 
her fathers welfare 
right now shes just worried about her daddy were just 
taking it one step at a time mrs cole said 
of course shes worried about her husband and her brothers 
but right now theyre not there yet we dont mean to be 
unfeeling but weve got to have our worry priorities in order

jordan closed its border with iraq at 
midnight wednesday as the country found itself unable to handle the 
flood of tens of thousands of refugees fleeing iraq and kuwait 
the announcement of the border closure came just hours after 
king hussein told a nationally televised news conference that 
42000 foreigners had entered jordan on wednesday the largest 
number of arrivals in a single day since the aug 2 iraqi invasion 
of kuwait 
interior minister salem masdeh said jordans northeast border 
with iraq would close at midnight wednesday 5 pm edt 
msadeh said the border was being closed because of concern for 
the health situation of the arrivals and to ensure suitable 
arrangements for their stay in jordan 
until we provide them with suitable shelter we find ourselves 
obliged to close the jordanian border for the foreign arrivals from 
iraq as of midnight wednesday he said 
at his nationally televised news conference king hussein said 
his country is heavily burdened by the flood of refugees 
on the human level we have some serious problems the 
jordanian monarch said 
we may have to slow down the process of receiving more people 
unless we can speed up the movement of people to their respective 
destinations hussein said we are trying our very best to 
provide food and shelter and medical facilities 
the number of arrivals wednesday easily exceeded the huge influx 
of 30000 foreigners who entered jordan on friday a jordanian 
security official said most of the refugees had arrived in the last 
10 days 
hussein said about 185000 refugees have crossed into jordan 
since aug 2 and only 67000 of them have moved on to other 
destinations the overwhelming majority of arrivals have been arab 
and asian nationals about 40 percent of them egyptians 
of the nearly 120000 refugees who remain in jordan he said 
we are finding enormous difficulty in meeting the needs of these 
people or in arranging adequate modes of transport for them to 
leave jordan 
transportation is limited in this poor country and people jam 
air terminals the port of aqaba and highways mosques hospitals 
schools and other public buildings have been pressed into makeshift 
accommodations 
hussein said six refugees have died in jordan two adults and 
four children but he did not say how they died 
security officials earlier had said a number of people died of 
heat exhaustion or sunstroke after the arduous overland journey 
through the desert from kuwait and iraq 
a senior security official speaking on condition of anonymity 
said jordan has asked iraq to decrease the flow of people the 
official said most of the refugees had entered jordan through the 
ruweishid border post 210 miles northeast of amman 
many of the refugees were left penniless when kuwaiti banks 
suddenly closed after the aug 2 takeover 
i have spent 12 years of my life working in kuwait and saving 
my money for the future and i ended up losing all of it said 
ahmad mohammad saleh a laborer from yemen who was staying at a 
mosque all my efforts and hard work were wasted he said in 
tears 
many are driven across jordan in bus and truck convoys escorted 
by police to the syrian or saudi border the same day of their 
arrival others leave through charter flights from ammans two 
airports 
egyptians are the largest single group of foreigners fleeing 
kuwait and iraq though 54000 egyptians have already passed 
through jordan more than 25000 have been stuck in the bottleneck 
of their only exit point jordans red sea port of aqaba 
they are waiting in cars and buses or under the blazing desert 
sun for space on the egyptian ferries that can handle only about 
3000 people daily 
egyptian ambassador mahab muqbel said wednesday his government 
had begun an airlift to relieve the congestion and would increase 
the number of ferries 
israel offered to allow egyptians overland passage from aqaba 
through a 10mile strip of israeli territory the strip forms a 
wedge at the top of the gulf of aqaba between jordanian and 
egyptian land egypt rejected the offer 
the congestion at aqaba is duplicated on a smaller scale in some 
parts of the capital hotels in amman are full the airport is 
jammed and the embassies of most asian and african countries are 
besieged 
the minister of religious affairs ali faqir ordered all 
mosques in the country to provide shelter and food for the 
foreigners jordanian charitable organizations are distributing 
thousands of free meals 
the security official said in an interview that government 
records showed that 193 american citizens as well as 38 britons had 
crossed at ruweishid since aug 7 he said almost all were arabs 
with dual nationality 
the iraqi government is preventing the departure of an estimated 
20000 westerners trapped in iraq and kuwait and intends to use 
them to deter possible attacks on strategic points such as military 
installations

from his vacation retreat in wyoming 
secretary of state james a baker iii sought the help of the soviet 
union wednesday in enforcing a worldwide economic blockade of iraq 
the response he got from foreign minister eduard a shevardnadze 
on the telephone was a request for a slowdown at the united 
nations us officials told the associated press 
but they said shevardnadze did not threaten a soviet veto or 
any other means to stop the united states from seeking approval of 
a military blockade 
in fact the officials said the soviets are using their close 
ties to iraq to urge the release of westerners including 
americans trapped in iraq and kuwait 
in any event the bush administration asserts it already has 
legal authority to enforce the embargo with or without a new un 
resolution 
the security council by a vote of 130 approved the embargo 
aug 6 and by unanimous vote on aug 9 declared iraqs annexation 
of kuwait void 
baker went to wyoming on vacation last week leaving deputy 
secretary of state lawrence eagleburger in charge at the state 
department 
the veteran us diplomat was at the white house sunday night 
advising president bush on the gulf crisis and again was at his 
side wednesday in kennebunkport maine 
at the same time baker has kept a hand in he talks frequently 
to bush by telephone as well as to other senior officials 
including brent scowcroft the presidents national security 
adviser 
the soviets supported bush from the outset on economic sanctions 
as a way of trying to compel iraq to reverse its occupation of 
kuwait bush on wednesday described soviet cooperation as 
superb 
state department spokesman richard boucher on tuesday called it 
excellent 
soviet support is critical as a permanent member of the un 
security council the soviets could block any resolution with a 
veto and moscow has had a long and warm relationship with iraq 
even though the soviets ordered a cutoff in weapons shipments 
soviet military experts continue to train iraqi soldiers in using 
sovietmanufactured weapons 
us officials who spoke on condition of anonymity said moscow 
had given washington assurances no advisers had assisted the iraqis 
in their assault on kuwait 
and yet the officials said the soviets gave the same 
assurances about iraqs eightyear war with iran and still were 
detected within range of the fighting 
the topic did not come up in bakers conversation with 
shevardnadze they said instead they talked mostly about the 
situation at the united nations 
the soviets want to let a certain period of time to pass before 
adopting a resolution calling for a military blockade the 
officials said 
one reason is the presence in moscow of a senior iraqi diplomat 
deputy prime minister sadun hammadi he has met with shevardnadze 
prime minister nikolai ryzhkov and igor belonsov who is overseeing 
the evacuation of soviet citizens from the gulf 
the soviets would like to wait at least until hammadi concludes 
his visit before approving a military blockade the officials said 
i dont think we are in serious disagreement a us 
official said but the soviets are hesitant to move as quickly as 
wed like to in enforcing the sanctions they are not working 
against us but we are looking for their support not just their 
acquiescence

president bush said wednesday the 
united states could stop iraqi shipping in the persian gulf right 
now but was weighing how much time to give the united nations to 
take further action backing up economic sanctions against iraq 
bush flanked by top military and national security advisers 
answered questions on the mideast crisis at his vacation home after 
signing an order calling up us reserves for military duty for the 
first time since the tet offensive in the vietnam war 
the president praised his military chiefs for the smoothness of 
the massive us military buildup in the saudi arabian desert and 
the gulf waters saying the pentagon had deployed the equivalent of 
a mediumsized american city 
he then went back inside for more consultations with his 
national security team including discussion of whether to give 
the united nations more time to take more productive action 
asked about iraqi tankers that failed to stop despite us 
warships warning shots bush said i think weve made clear to 
shipping that they can be stopped and we have the forces to stop 
them right now 
at the united nations the five permanent security council 
members considered a resolution authorizing military force to back 
up sanctions against iraq but reached no agreement on the 
precedentsetting proposal 
in washington us officials speaking on condition of anonymity 
said secretary of state james a baker iii had sought the help of 
the soviet union in enforcing a worldwide economic blockade of iraq 
but baker who telephoned shevardnadze from wyoming where the 
secretary was vacationing was asked in turn by foreign minister 
eduard a shevardnadze to slow down us efforts at the un the 
officials said 
bush made clear that international backing was important saying 
repeatedly that the united states was not standing alone against 
iraq 
this is not a matter between iraq and the united states of 
america it is between iraq and the entire world community arab 
and nonarab alike he said we are not in this alone we stand 
shoulder to shoulder right there in the middle east with the armed 
forces of 22 other nations 
asked if his recent comments and actions were meant to prepare 
people for the possibility of war and the loss of american lives 
bush said 
i think any time you move american forces and any time you are 
up against what most of the world now considers to be an outrageous 
violator of international law that the best thing is to be 
prepared 
on other mideast subjects 
bush was asked how constrained he felt by the 3000 americans 
trapped in iraq and kuwait including some taken by the iraqi army 
to vital military sites he said any decisionmaker in the 
united states or in any of these countries is concerned about the 
lives of innocent civilians innocent people you weigh that very 
thoroughly against your actions but he added that the un 
sanctions must be enforced 
he declined to answer when asked about a report that the 
soviet union still had 193 military advisers in iraq despite the 
united nations embargo moscow has supported 
at this point i would say we are getting superb cooperation 
from the soviets he said noting that baker had talked earlier 
in the day with shevardnadze 
bush said the united states would not comply with iraqs order 
to shut down the american embassy in kuwait city by friday and he 
doubted other nations would either the state department announced 
earlier it would draw down all but essential diplomatic staff 
he said the occupation of kuwait is illegal under 
international law and other countries agree totally that we must 
not take the position that this illegal regime can shut down 
legitimate embassies as a result of their aggression 
he said the us embassies in iraq and kuwait would provide safe 
haven to americans who managed to reach them 
bush said increasingly hostile statements from baghdad about 
the united states betrayed a sense of irrational urgency there 
saddam he said is trying to whip up support and make this 
iraq versus the united states indeed it is iraq versus the rest 
of the world 
bush said he had conferred at length by telephone wednesday with 
west german chancellor helmut kohl he also spoke with greek prime 
minister constantine mitsotakis continuing his daily round of 
conversations with global leaders on the gulf crisis 
the president midway through a 25day vacation in maine that 
has repeatedly been interrupted by crisis planning urged americans 
to conserve energy but said supplies for now are adequate and he 
disdained a suggestion that he might want to keep his 
twomilepergallon speedboat fidelity docked 
im going to keep using my boat and i hope the rest of 
america will prudently recreate i dont think weve reached the 
point where i want to call on everybody in the recreation industry 
to shut it down or everybody thats taking a vacation in america 
to shut it down bush said 
we are doing everything we can to guarantee that we dont 
panic americans and that there will be an adequate supply of 
hydrocarbons but i think it is a good time to conserve i would 
call upon americans to conserve 
reporters asked bush to prod the saudis not to restrict the 
american news media from covering operation desert shield 
bush gave an equivocal reply saying we are the guests of 
saudi arabia in their country the more coverage the better as 
far as were concerned 
he also said referring to reporters who manage to reach iraq 
that they should ask tough questions and be totally objective 
in their coverage 
asked about the saudi foreign ministers statement tuesday that 
iraq was willing to put all the cards on the table and 
negotiate bush said if theyre willing to put all their cards 
on the table thats good including complying with 
international law that would be good 
bush in his executive order said the callup of reserves was 
necessary for the effective conduct of operational missions 
in and around the arabian peninsula 
the president sent letters to congress informing leaders there 
of his action that empowers cheney to designate the reservists to 
perform missions he may determine necessary 
it was the first time the president has activated the reserves 
since march 1970 when the reserves were called up during a postal 
strike the last time reservists were called up for military duty 
was in january 1968 when the vietcongs tet offensive led 
president lyndon b johnson to call up more than 35000

president bush on wednesday called 
on americans to conserve energy but said he has no intentions of 
giving up vacation jaunts on his power boat 
bush said during a news conference at his vacation home that 
there is no reason to expect an oil shortage despite a reduction 
in world oil supplies cause by iraqs invasion of kuwait and a 
subsequent international embargo on iraqi trade 
im going to keep using my boat and i hope the rest of 
america will prudently recreate said bush who has taken 
excursions on his boat fidelity during his vacation 
i dont think weve reached the point where i want to call on 
everybody in the recreation industry to shut it down or everybody 
thats taking a vacation in america to shut it down the 
president said 
persian gulf tensions have meant a 42 millionbarrel daily 
reduction in oil on the world market but there had been a supply 
glut and other oil producing nations are expected to make up much 
of the shortfall 
before iraq invaded kuwait the united states was importing 
between 600000 and 700000 barrels per day from the two nations 
about 4 percent of total us oil consumption there are 42 gallons 
of oil in a barrel 
bush declined to say what conservation measures he favors last 
week energy secretary james d watkins proposed boosting us oil 
production while asking drivers to trim their gasoline use by 
keeping tires properly inflated and obeying speed limits 
were doing everything we can to guarantee that we dont panic 
americans and that there will be an adequate supply of 
hydrocarbons the president said 
i think it is a good time to conserve so im glad you 
reminded me of that and i would call upon americans to conserve 
bush said in response to a question that doesnt mean that life 
screeches to a halt

president bush and defense secretary dick 
cheney said wednesday they would welcome freer media access to us 
troops in saudi arabia but its up to the saudis to allow it 
we are the guests of saudi arabia in their country bush 
said during a news conference at his vacation home in 
kennebunkport maine and the more coverage the better as far as 
were concerned 
asked by a reporter if he meant were at the total mercy of 
saudi arabia that theres nothing we can do bush said he wasnt 
saying that and handed off the question to cheney 
cheney said us officials would try to secure freer access for 
journalists but acknowledged that ultimately the saudis are in 
charge 
i do not have the final authority over what kind of access the 
government of saudi arabia grants to our press he said well 
work with the government of saudi arabia to provide as much access 
as we can 
in the final analysis he said theyll make the decision 
but obviously we will be advocates for the concept that there 
should be significant coverage of us forces in saudi arabia 
available to the american people 
the questions to bush and cheney were prompted by reports that 
the saudis are beginning to restrict media coverage and may order 
most foreign journalists out of the country possibly by weeks end 
bush after saying he supported freer coverage raised the 
subject of the work of journalists who went to iraq and talked to 
officials there 
when people travel to countries like iraq and countries of 
that nature i hope the press coverage will be totally 
objective he said i hope the same tough questions are asked 
in every country as they are in this country and im speaking of 
iraq particularly 
asked by a network reporter if he were criticizing coverage 
bush replied im not criticizing dont be so sensitive about 
it 
cheney commenting on the prospects for freer access in saudi 
arabia said the saudis may not see eyetoeye with the us media 
on what constitutes free and unrestricted coverage 
theyre very private in their personal lives and i think we 
have to respect their culture just as they respect ours cheney 
said 
by the same token i think it is important that we have an 
adequate flow of information to the american people about what our 
young men and women are doing in saudi arabia and im hopeful that 
well be able to arrange that he said 
cheney said coverage had been pretty good so far under 
difficult circumstances there are a lot of stories being filed 
out of saudi arabia he said 
however 11 major news organizations expressed concern about 
current and prospective restrictions in saudi arabia in a letter 
wednesday to bush 
the media said minimum access has been available through the 
defense department pool and extremely limited unilateral 
representation with more severe limitations in the offing 
we respectfully request that the administration do everything 
in its power to gain full media access to saudi arabia and to the 
american presence there the groups said perhaps accreditation 
through the american military would be the correct solution 
the letter was signed by officials in the washington bureaus of 
abc cbs nbc and cnn the associated press time and newsweek 
magazines and the washington post wall street journal new york 
times and los angeles times

prime minister yitzhak shamir warned iraq on 
wednesday that it will pay a terrible and fearsome price if it 
tries to drag israel into the persian gulf conflict 
shamir said president saddam hussein of iraq is trying to 
involve israel so he can present this war as an arabisraeli war 
and then the whole arab world would have to back him 
he denied iraqi claims that israeli soldiers were taking part in 
the us military buildup in saudi arabia and that disguised 
israeli pilots and warplanes took part in the american effort 
israel had no involvement whatsoever in this storm from the 
beginning nobody can blame israel that it played some role 
here shamir said on israel television in his first major 
interview since iraq invaded kuwait on aug 2 
those elements who wish to drag us into this whirlpool and 
maybe plan to attack israel know perfectly well that if they try to 
do it they will pay a terrible and fearsome price people of 
israel are not ready to play with their fate 
shamir acknowledged anxiety existed among the israeli public and 
that the government was worried over this hour of emergency 
but he refused to calm israelis by divulging details about iraqi 
military capabilities 
saddam has said he will retaliate by attacking israel with 
chemical weapons in event of a us military strike israeli 
military experts conflict on whether iraqi missiles can carry 
chemical warheads 
israel has said it will retaliate if iraq attacks and launch a 
military strike if iraqi troops enter jordan which is between iraq 
and israel 
shamir assured jordans king hussein that israel will not attack 
his country first and was only interested in the stability of 
husseins throne 
banging his fist on the table he then assured israel the army 
was ready for battle and will know how to defend israel at the 
hour of emergency 
shamirs comments came after a senior government official said 
war between the united states and iraq seemed inevitable and 
military analysts estimated that israel would probably be dragged 
into such a conflict 
the bottom line is that the united states and iraq are on a 
collision course said the official speaking on condition of 
anonymity 
the americans are continuing to amass troops and you dont do 
that unless you have the intention of using them at the same time 
you dont see the iraqis offering anything that can provide a 
reasonable basis for negotiations 
shamir declined comment when asked about this scenario saying 
his job was to consider israeli response to any eventuality 
but military analysts several of whom regularly get leaks from 
senior army officials agreed with the assessment 
most israeli observers believe that its likely the situation 
will escalate into fighting between the united states and iraq 
said joseph alpher deputy head of tel aviv universitys jaffee 
center for strategic studies 
if and when fighting between the united states and iraq breaks 
out then iraq most likely will try to drag israel into it in order 
to rally arab support 
the escalation in the gulf poses a dilemma for israel 
while israel sees itself as americas chief ally in the region 
its role has been to keep a low profile so as not to break up the 
alliance against iraq us officials have tried to build with other 
arab nations 
differences over how low israels profile should be were evident 
in arguments among cabinet ministers over whether the government 
should distribute gas masks to the public to protect against a 
possible iraqi attack 
some officials called for immediate distribution defense 
authorities maintain this could panic the public or sent a wrong 
signal to iraq government leaders met on wednesday to consider the 
question but delayed a decision by creating a special ministerial 
committee

the united states bolstered its forces in the persian gulf on 
wednesday with a callup of reserves and jordan closed its border 
with iraq because of the strain of thousands of evacuees fleeing 
iraq and occupied kuwait 
baghdad meanwhile claimed that two aircraft flying in from 
saudi arabia penetrated three miles into its airspace an 
unidentified military spokesman quoted by the official iraqi news 
agency did not identify the planes or say whether they turned back 
voluntarily or were chased by iraqi planes 
it also was not clear if the spokesman was referring to a 
penetration of iraqs own southern border with saudi arabia or that 
of kuwait which baghdad now considers part of iraq 
on the diplomatic front cracks appeared in what had been 
unprecedented ussoviet unity in the face of iraqi aggression 
reports from the united nations said moscow was slowing efforts to 
win un approval of a resolution allowing warships to enforce 
sanctions against iraq 
in moscow officials disclosed that soviet military experts 
continue to train iraqi soldiers in the use of their sovietbuilt 
weapons three weeks after moscow cut arms supplies to protest the 
invasion of kuwait 
secretary of state james a baker iii telephoned soviet foreign 
minister eduard shevardnadze to urge moscow to cooperate more fully 
in isolating iraq a state department official said speaking on 
condition of anonymity 
the state department announced it would defy saddam husseins 
demand to close the us embassy in kuwait by friday but said it 
would reduce the staff other nations including britain have 
announced plans to do the same 
department spokesman richard boucher said the decision was 
consistent with our obligations to the american private 
community 
about 2500 americans have been trapped in kuwait and an 
estimated 500 in iraq since iraqi forces invaded kuwait on aug 2 
there are about 120 us diplomats in kuwait 
iraqi took over its neighbor and drove out the ruling family 
after accusing kuwait of stealing oil from a field that includes 
land both sides claim iraq also blamed kuwait for a loss in vital 
oil revenue saying it drove down world oil prices by cheating on 
its oil production quota 
jordans announcement that it was closing its border came 
shortly after king hussein told a news conference a total of 42000 
foreigners had crossed into jordan during the day the largest 
number since the crisis erupted 
interior minister salem msadeh said the border was being closed 
because of concern for the health situation of the arrivals and 
to ensure suitable arrangements for their stay in jordan 
hussein also said he would embark on a new round of talks with 
arab leaders in hopes of defusing the crisis he declined to say 
where he would go or with whom he would meet 
speaking in his palace to a room crowded with journalists 
hussein said he believed we are almost facing a crisis of the 
world gone mad 
many egyptians palestinians and other mostly arab refugees 
fleeing kuwait have entered jordan only a few westerners have been 
able to flee to safety iraq is holding the rest in a bid to force 
the withdrawal of the usled multinational force defending saudi 
arabia from iraqi aggression 
president bush ordered the pentagon to call up reserves for 
active duty in the gulf he did not say how many units were called 
up but sources said as many as 40000 may join operation desert 
shield by the end of the month 
it was the first activation of military reserves in 20 years 
at the same time the united states intensified the military 
buildup in the persian gulf the aircraft carrier saratoga steamed 
through egypts suez canal toward the red sea to join a growing 
american flotilla a canal spokesman said 
us and other warships have been shadowing iraqi vessels in the 
gulf to enforce the un embargo one of those vessels an iraqi 
tanker that defied warning shots from an american warship reached 
yemens port of aden wednesday and dropped anchor near two other 
iraqi ships in the harbor yemen had told the un security council 
it would turn away the tanker and adhere to un sanctions 
the five permanent members of the security council met wednesday 
to discuss a possible military blockade to enforce the sanctions 
but moscow was holding back western diplomats said saying the 
soviets want proof of the embargos failure before approving 
military force 
china had dragged its feet for the same reason but a kuwaiti 
official in beijing said wednesday the chinese government promised 
not to block such a resolution 
us ambassador thomas pickering said the five permanent council 
members the united states the soviet union britain china and 
france were making progress drafting a resolution

president bush on wednesday opened 
the way for a us company to help build a space port in australia 
for a commercial firm that eventually hopes to launch americanmade 
satellites with soviet rockets 
bush authorized the state department to grant a license to usbi 
co of huntsville ala a subsidiary of united technologies for 
the company to participate in the project at cape york australia 
the launch site would be operated in conjunction with the cape york 
space agency 
bushs approval was needed because of security restrictions on 
sharing of technology with foreign countries it allows planning 
for the project to proceed but does not give a final sign off 
whether americanmade satellites will ever be launched from cape 
york is only a hypothetical question at this time said a source on 
the presidents national space council who asked not to be named 
no us satellite manufacturer vendor or user has said he 
wants to launch on a soviet rocket the source said usbi has 
been invited by the aussies to help design and run the facility 
they need their expertise thats what the license is all about 
usbi would provide program management engineering and 
development for the launching facility and the soviet union would 
provide the boosters the united states government has no 
involvement except to approve the license said white house 
spokesman steve hart 
the final license for the project could only be granted upon 
completion of agreements among the soviets australia and usbi he 
said the agreements must provide that the soviets provide boosters 
only for the single launch site and that us regulations on 
technology transfers to the soviet union will be observed the 
white house said 
those agreements are expected to be worked out in the near 
future 
hart said the governments intent is to ensure fair competition 
in international commercial space ventures 
usbi executive vice president al reeser said in a statement that 
the licensing will enable us to be a major participant in 
international launch services 
we are pleased usbi is able to support the cape york space 
agency it is a big step for us 
the cape york space agency is a private international consortium 
that hopes to provide launch services needed to support commercial 
space ventures 
the consortium was started by more than 60 firms from several 
nations

the international committee of the red cross is 
treading gingerly in the gulf crisis fearing to anger iraq by 
concentrating on the fate of western hostages 
highlighting its precarious position was prime minister margaret 
thatchers accusation that the icrc had failed to act to protect 
the thousands of trapped foreigners 
there was no direct comment from the allswiss agency 
traditionally pledged to confidentiality in its role as impartial 
monitor of the geneva conventions 
a spokesman merely noted that the icrc has been in touch with 
all states concerned since early august to ensure protection of the 
civilian population in both iraq and kuwait 
the head of the agencys middle east section flew to baghdad 
monday with a personal message from icrc president cornelio 
sommaruga dealing with all issues of humanitarian concern 
sources familiar with committee thinking said its first aim is 
to continue practical work to help all people requiring assistance 
focusing on the trapped westerners would raise doubts about its 
neutral stand the sources added 
the icrc has been seeking authority to visit kuwait to find out 
about the medical food and other needs of the population it has 
also been seeking to gain access to foreign nationals but without 
success 
the text of the 1949 geneva convention on the protection of 
civilians suggests that iraq is clearly in violation of its 
provisions iraq joined the convention in 1956 
but so far the icrc has stopped short of saying so publicly 
by the announced transfer of foreigners to strategic locations 
baghdad violated article 28 stipulating that the presence of a 
protected person may not be used to render certain points or areas 
immune from military operations 
a 1977 additional protocol elaborates on that but neither iraq 
nor the united states has ratified it 
the text says the presence or movement of civilians shall not 
be used in attempts to shield military objectives from attacks 
or to shield favor or impede military operations 
the 1949 convention says the taking of hostages is 
prohibited and that all aliens must be free to leave the 
territory of a party to a conflict unless their departure is 
contrary to the national interests of the state 
internees must not be held in areas particularly exposed to 
the dangers of war and they have the right to be visited by icrc 
delegates a special section dealing with occupied territories 
includes a prohibition of individual or mass transfers of 
persons from there to the territory of the occupying power 
kuwait is an occupied territory according to a un security 
council resolution but so far iraq has not allowed icrc delegates 
to visit there 
the section on occupied territories has been cited by the icrc 
on repeated occasions in denouncing israels policies in the west 
bank and gaza strip 
but the organizations position in israel is relatively strong 
because the jewish state cannot afford the bad publicity of barring 
the 42 icrc delegates working there 
in contrast any public stand by the icrc against iraq might 
spell an end to its humanitarian mission in the gulf crisis 
sources familiar with icrc concepts said the agency has to be 
pragmatic and that it must not risk blocking its work for a 
question of principle its baghdad delegation includes 37 members 
the sources who declined to be identified further said the 
icrc had to maintain credible neutrality in this confrontation and 
to stress that it is not an instrument of western or any other 
governments 
the geneva conventions say it is up to signatory governments to 
make sure they are respected 
the decision by neutral switzerland a nonun member to join 
the un sanctions against iraq has increased difficulties for the 
icrc the agency is known to have had serious misgivings when the 
bern government proposed joining the world body a proposal that 
was overwhelmingly defeated in a 1986 referendum

nbc the only one of the three major us 
networks not yet allowed into iraq since the persian gulf crisis 
accused iraq on wednesday of denying it entry because of seven 
highly critical nbc reports since 1988 
it said it was being censored by that nation because of nbc 
reports that include ones on iraqs use of poison gas on its 
kurdish minority iraqs efforts to obtain triggers for nuclear 
weapons and the countrys biological weapons development program 
nbcs rivals also have reported on those stories 
nbcs unusual statement came as cable news network said that 
iraq had granted it entry visas for washington columnist rowland 
evans who does two cnn weekend shows and a cnn crew the visas 
are good for thursday and friday 
we expect to have them in there tomorrow said cnn spokesman 
john bianchi 
despite repeated and aggressive efforts by nbc to get 
similar visas nbc news has still been denied access to iraq 
nbc news executive vice president don browne said in a statement 
we can only conclude that we are being censored by the iraq 
government singled out because of a series of exclusive reports 
on nbc nightly news he said referring to a list of seven nbc 
reports on the program 
cbs and abc crews led by anchorman dan rather and ted koppel 
respectively were allowed into baghdad last week with koppel the 
first us network journalist permitted in since iraqs aug 2 
takeover of kuwait 
iraq officials have since ordered all of them out the last 
network contingent to leave was from cbs it left baghdad on 
tuesday 
cnns evans who writes the syndicated evans and novak 
column with robert novak is being sent to baghdad instead of a 
regular cnn correspondent because of his long expertise in middle 
east affairs said bianchi 
it isnt yet known if evans will be able to arrange an interview 
with iraq leader saddam hussein bianchi said we dont know what 
theyll get or what theyll be allowed to get

two weeks after the fbi settled a racial 
harassment case brought by black agent donald rochon the agency 
named its topranking black field agent to investigate allegations 
brought by rochon the fbi said wednesday 
as part of the settlement of the rochon case the agency agreed 
to conduct a full investigation of rochons claims and make the 
findings public by next april said rochons attorney david kairys 
of philadelphia 
we are confirming that paul philip will be heading an 
investigation looking into the allegations made by mr rochon 
fbi spokesman carlos fernandez said wednesday 
philip 43 currently heads the field office in san juan puerto 
rico he is the only black agent in charge of a bureau field office 
the appointment by fbi director william s sessions was made 
very very recently fernandez said but it had not been 
announced because we have investigations all the time being 
headed by special agents we dont make announcements about that 
the new york times reported wednesday on the appointment 
rochon had charged in civil lawsuits that he was racially 
harassed by white agents when he worked in the fbis chicago 
office among other things he claimed his family received 
threatening telephone calls and letters including one that 
contained a photograph of the dismembered body of a black man 
another contained a bulls eye superimposed with a picture of a 
black man 
attorneys for the 40yearold rochon and the fbi signed an 
agreement the week of aug 5 that settled the 3yearold legal 
battle the settlement brought rochon full pay and pension 
benefits possibly worth a total of more than 1 million kairys 
said 
several members of congress accused sessions in april of 
tolerating discrimination allegations denied by sessions 
a federal judge ruled in september 1988 that the fbi had engaged 
in widespread discrimination against its hispanic employees 
officials acknowledged earlier this year that the fbi had settled 
three other racial discrimination suits including one involving 30 
employees of the fingerprint identification section 
philip has a tough assignment said one congressional 
source who spoke on condition of anonymity but the source added 
we think its significant that he reports directly to the 
director and he has a team of eight agents working for him he 
certainly has the manpower to do the job 
fernandez said it was not clear where philip will be based as he 
conducts the investigation 
hes not going to be in any one particular place fernandez 
said hell go wherever the investigation takes him 
rochon has been on disability leave since april because of 
emotional stress and the settlement keeps him on disability leave 
until he is eligible to retire in 11 years kairys said in 
addition the fbi agreed to award rochon some back pay for a 
promotion the agent claimed he was unfairly denied and will pay 
rochons former wife susan an undisclosed sum of money as 
compensation

a contract clause citing war as a valid 
excuse for canceling hotel reservations helped save a national 
guard group about 10000 wednesday 
because of the crisis in the persian gulf there are about 600 
fewer national guard members than expected at the 19th annual 
conference of the enlisted association of the national guard of the 
united states said master sgt tony nathe he is president of the 
private lobbying group which has about 60000 national guard 
members 
the conference opened tuesday at the hyatt regency hotel where 
the group had expected about 1500 members to attend meetings over 
four days nathe said 
attendance suffered because a large percentage of the group 
normally flies to the event in national guard transport planes as 
part of training for national guard pilots he said most of those 
planes were unavailable because of the conflict nathe said 
because the group filled less than 80 percent of its reserved 
block of rooms at the hyatt it faced a charge of about 10000 for 
use of meeting rooms that otherwise would have been free he said 
they hotel managers were saying come on youre not going 
to meet your block nathe said i told them to look at the 
war clause 
a clause in the hotel contract said the agreement was subject to 
acts of god war government regulations disaster strikes 
civil disorder curtailment of transportation facilities or other 
emergency 
actually theres been no war declared but officially theres 
been no declaration of war since world war ii and you know weve 
been in combat since then said sgt robert metcalf a conference 
organizer 
it was pretty hard to hold them to the contract because of 
that clause said bill gannage the hotels executive assistant 
manager of food and beverage its necessary to be as flexible as 
possible based on the circumstances in the middle east 
the group had made 400 room reservations at the hyatt and needed 
to occupy 320 of the rooms to have free use of the meeting rooms 
said mike pileggi a conference organizer the group only filled 
193 of the rooms pileggi said 
softening the blow the guard group agreed to have a banquet at 
the hyatt on friday the banquet had been scheduled for another 
site in minneapolis but was switched because fewer people than 
expected had signed up metcalf said

a company that makes a fiveminute aids test said 
wednesday it has recalled a batch of 11000 because of weak 
readings for the presence of antibodies against the deadly virus 
our quality control department found that the performance in 
this particular lot no longer meets our quality control release 
standards said christina pappas a spokeswoman for 
worcesterbased cambridge bioscience 
pappas said the 11000 tests packed in 140 kits represent 
only a fraction of the companys sales for the test the tests are 
designed for use by physicians in clinics 
the bioscience test is the only fiveminute aids test that has 
received approval from the food and drug administration according 
to an fda spokesman other tests must be sent out to testing 
laboratories for results 
pappas said that as far as the company knows there have been no 
reports of false test results either positive or negative 
the company has notified all its customers and is replacing kits

the cost of cleaning up the exxon valdez oil 
spill off the coast of alaska helped give the state the fastest 
growing per capita income in the nation last year the government 
said wednesday 
alaskans per capita 1989 income totaled 21656 for each man 
woman and child up 126 percent from the year earlier according 
to revised estimates by the commerce departments bureau of 
economic analysis 
that was nearly double the national average growth rate of 66 
percent the average per capita income was 17596 
per capita income is the annual total personal income of 
residents divided by the states population personal income is 
income received from all sources less personal contributions for

was the only state east of the mississippi river to make the top 10 
the four western states had fast nonfarm income growth 
mainly in manufacturing construction and private servicetype 
industries the report said 
the five farm states had fast growth in farm income 
mainly reflecting a rebound from the 1988 drought it said 
much of alaskas earnings came from the lumber food processing 
and oil and gas industries the report said 
but it added a strong gain in transportation earnings 
reflected expenditures for cleanup operations associated with the 
oil spill in march 1989 hotel services and retail trade also 
showed strength in alaska these industries supplied shelter and 
food for workers involved in the clean up 
hundreds of miles of alaska shoreline were fouled when the 
tanker exxon valdez slammed into a charted reef march 24 1989 
releasing nearly 11 million gallons of north slope crude oil into 
the water 
it was the nations biggest oil spill coating hundreds of miles 
of shoreline and killing hundreds of otters and thousands of birds 
and other animals 
last summers 2 billion cleanup program involved more than 
10000 workers and 1000 boats 
north dakota had the second fastest per capita growth rate up 
99 percent it was followed by hawaii 97 percent montana 94 
percent south dakota 86 percent idaho 83 percent iowa 82 
percent maine and nevada 8 percent each and washington state 
78 percent

convicted killer mark hofmann the forger 
of mormon historical documents who used bombs to cover his tracks 
was in critical but stable condition wednesday following a drug 
overdose officials said 
hofmann 35 serving a life sentence was found unconscious at 
utah state prison shortly after noon and was taken to the 
university of utah health sciences center said hospital 
spokeswoman anne brillinger 
brillinger confirmed that for the second time in less than two 
years hofmann was being treated for an overdose of antidepressant 
drugs she said he was conscious but still listed as critical 
hofmann pleaded guilty in january 1987 to seconddegree murder 
in the oct 15 1985 pipebomb slayings of steven f christensen 
30 and kathleen webb sheets 50 he also pleaded guilty to theft 
by deception in his fraudulent document dealings which netted him 
hundreds of thousands of dollars 
hofmann has said he killed christensen to prevent him exposing 
his trafficking in fraudulent mormon historical documents and left 
the second bomb outside the sheets home as a diversion 
hofmann became the chief suspect in the two bombings a day after 
the explosions when a third pipe bomb blew him from his parked car 
in downtown salt lake city hofmann claimed he meant to kill 
himself but police scoffed at that notion saying he was seeking 
another victim 
hofmann was hospitalized after a guard was unable to awaken him 
for his noon meal said dave franchina a state department of 
corrections spokesman hofmann was being housed in a 
maximumsecurity unit with a convicted killer who was taking a 
routine cold medication franchina said hofmann wasnt taking any 
prescription medication he said 
hofmann didnt have access to the infirmary but could mingle 
with other inmates for four hours a day franchina said 
investigators found nothing during an initial search of the cell 
on sept 15 1988 hofmann was rushed from the prison to the 
same hospital in critical condition after taking an overdose of 
antidepressants in quantities sufficient barring medical aid to 
have caused his death

banned from export 
cowley was formerly associated with space research corp of 
brussels belgium founded by gerald bull a canadianborn us 
citizen 
bull credited with being the worlds leading designer of 
longrange guns was was mysteriously murdered outside an apartment 
in a brussels suburb on march 22 and his heirs said later the

his technology was used by israel south africa and both sides in 
the iraniraq conflict 
bull was said to be working for iraqi president saddam hussein 
on a satellite to be launched from a rocketpropelled shell fired 
from a huge cannon at the time of his death 
cowley who was charged previously in other dealings was 
released on bond of 48000 until oct 10 by magistrates in 
sheffield northern england 
british customs officers in april seized large tubes that they 
said could be used to construct a giant gun barrel trucks heading

140nation conference reviewing implementation of the 1970 treaty 
he did not specifically name any countries in referring to the 
question of clandestine procurement of nuclear technology but he

richard w miller turned to espionage out of 
frustration with his life and career and his infatuation with a 
soviet spy a prosecutor alleged wednesday as the former fbi 
agents third trial began 
his brand of espionage was a crime of dollars and cents it 
was a crime of lust it was a crime of dissatisfaction for him it 
was even a crime of boredom assistant us attorney adam schiff 
said in opening statement 
most of all the prosecutor added it was crime of pure 
selfishness and selfinterest 
millers defense attorney joel levine denied the agent had 
traded secrets for sex and money and contended he actually started 
his relationship with a soviet spy to infiltrate the kgb so he 
could score points with the fbi 
miller was trying to resurrect his career and to coin a 
phrase snatch victory from the jaws of defeat levine said in 
his opening statement 
miller wearing a tan suit over his large frame took notes 
during opening statements two of millers sons sat among the 
spectators behind him in the courtroom 
the court session wednesday marked the beginning of the third 
trial for miller the first fbi agent ever accused and convicted of 
espionage 
his first trial ended in a hung jury and the second resulted in 
a conviction later overturned by an appeals court because of trial 
errors 
the latest trial is being held without a jury before us 
district court judge robert takasugi who took over for judge david 
kenyon after presiding over the first two trials kenyon 
disqualified himself from further action 
the defense had requested takasugi decide the case to avoid 
another hung jury that could prompt yet another trial 
miller arrested in 1984 was imprisoned for five years before 
being granted bail in october 1989 by the appellate court he was 
released from prison in november 1989 after posting 337000 bail 
as in the previous trials attorneys on both sides portrayed 
miller as an overweight bumbler of an fbi agent so absentminded 
he once left his keys in front door of an fbi field office when he 
left for the night 
once again the prosecution sought to link millers problems at 
work to his relationship with soviet spy svetlana ogorodnikov whom 
he met in 1984 
schiff said that in 1984 millers career was down in the dumps 
he was spending 40 hours a week listening to wiretaps and had been 
given a twoweek suspension for failing to meet an fbi weight 
standard 
millers marriage was crumbling and his financial problems were 
so bad he was taking out cash advances on his credit card and 
holding an outside job selling advertising for shopping carts to 
make ends meet 
richard w miller was ready for a private rebellion said 
schiff the evidence will show that richard w miller did not 
start his fbi career intending to be a spy but a spy he became 
for miller ms ogorodinkov offered a solution to all his 
problems the prosecutor said 
the two began a sexual relationship and miller accepted 65000 
in cash and gold for giving her an fbi document outlining us 
intelligence goals schiff said 
miller was infatuated with svetlana ogorodnikova he enjoyed 
spending time with her enjoyed sex with her said schiff 
he then saw her as a terrific opportunity to make a quick buck 
and a very big buck 
the prosecutor said that when miller discovered the fbi was on 
his trail he admitted several times to passing the document to 
her and at one point even referred to documents in the plural 
the validity of the admissions are central to millers defense 
takasugi denied a defense pretrial request to exclude the 
statements from the trial 
his attorneys contend miller tried to tell the truth but that 
fbi agents with the preconceived notion he was lying grilled him 
until he told them what they wanted to hear 
the defense also pointed to religious admonitions miller got 
from his boss richard bretzing a bishop in the mormon church 
those admonitions and other conversations pressured miller into 
an admission levine said 
mr miller became very emotional from those admonitions 
and in fact cried on both occasions said levine 
levine noted the fbi had tried in 1982 to use ms ogordnidov to 
get into the kgb with no success and details of the investigation 
were in a file miller had reviewed 
the defense attorney acknowledged miller was a bad agent in 
many respects but levine contended it was millers shortcomings 
that prompted him to try to infiltrate the kgb without 
authorization

the bush administration decided wednesday to 
reduce the staff of the us embassy in kuwait but defied iraqi 
president saddam hussein by refusing to shut down 
saddam has set friday as the deadline for the us and other 
foreign embassies to close and shift operations to baghdad the 
iraqi capital 
asked what would happen next president bush said well wait 
and see 
there are about 60 american diplomats and about 60 dependents in 
kuwait city the state department ordered all the dependents 
including nearly 30 children to leave 
a number of us diplomats also were ordered to leave state 
department spokesman richard boucher said those officials no longer 
were needed because their jobs involved dealing with the overthrown 
kuwaiti government he declined to say how many were involved 
about 2500 americans are trapped in the persian gulf country 
some may have been rounded up with other westerners and sent to oil 
refineries and other industrial sites as a deterrent to us 
military attack 
on monday bush described the americans in kuwait and about 530 
in iraq as hostages he has insisted unsuccessfully so far that 
they be permitted to leave 
mohamed sadiq almashat the iraqi ambassador to washington was 
summoned to the state department on wednesday to receive a special 
appeal for the release of 12 americans with what boucher described 
as urgent medical problems 
he gave a noncommittal reply and was expected to convey the 
request to baghdad a us official said afterward 
boucher said the us intention to keep the embassy open was 
consistent with un security council resolutions and with our 
obligations to the american private community 
the reduction in embassy staff was announced in a separate 
message for broadcast to americans in kuwait by the voice of 
america and the british broadcasting co 
the iraqi government has from the beginning of this situation 
stated that diplomats are free to leave kuwait the message said 
we are taking them at their word and have ordered the departure 
of all dependents and staff that do not have a mission in kuwait at 
this time 
the first group of us diplomats and dependents designated to 
leave kuwait will depart in the next day or so boucher said 
another eight americans who worked for united nations agencies 
in kuwait and their families may have reached jordan tuesday night 
he said 
britain the soviet union and several other nations already had 
decided to reduce their diplomatic staffs in kuwait but to keep 
their embassies open despite saddams order 
american citizens should be assured that we plan to have 
sufficient diplomatic staff at the embassy in kuwait to look after 
their safety and welfare which remains our highest priority 
boucher said 
the announcement made no reference to a staff reduction it 
stressed that ambassador nathaniel howell and other american 
diplomats in kuwait will serve our community to the best of their 
ability 
we are determined to continue working for your release from 
kuwait and your safe return to your families it said 
the broadcast advised americans thinking of leaving kuwait to 
plan their route carefully it said iraqi forces were under 
orders to stop and detain anyone identified as a us citizen a 
british citizen trying to leave the country was shot and killed 
the broadcast said 
until now the state department and the embassy had advised 
americans not to try to leave kuwait without permission about 500 
americans ignored the advice and got out 
asked why the message had been changed boucher said the 
situation for americans has changed we try to provide our best 
advice 
one problem confronting administration decisionmakers is 
whether the american diplomats will be able to leave easily or 
safely boucher said iraq had given assurances they would not need 
exit permits 
last week when iraq demanded that americans and britons in 
kuwait gather at hotels the embassy conveyed the order but gave no 
specific advice a handful of americans went to the hotel found no 
iraqi authorities there and left the next day 
saddam on monday warned diplomats in kuwait to close their 
embassies by friday and transfer their missions to baghdad 
otherwise a foreign ministry spokesman said they will be 
treated as ordinary foreign nationals 
nine western european nations meeting tuesday in paris 
rejected the ultimatum

abdallah died nov 26 from a gunshot during a dispute with 
denard at the presidential palace denard admits being in the same

glass beads found in hydrogen lines 
from the space shuttle columbia contributed to its fuel leaks nasa 
said wednesday 
the shuttle has been outfitted with new fuel plumbing and is 
scheduled to lift off sept 1 carrying the astro observatory 
weve looked for contamination we dont see any said 
william lenoir head of nasas space flight program 
workers on wednesday replaced part of a valve on one of 
columbias three main engines that wasnt working properly 
were comfortable with the hardware we have on the pad 
lenoir said 
nasa scrubbed its attempt to launch columbia on may 30 when 
hydrogen leaks were detected during fueling atlantis also was 
found to have a hydrogen leak but in a different spot 
columbias hydrogen lines were removed for inspection and seals 
on a 17inchdiameter valve were found to leak lenoir said the 
valve is in a pipe that carries liquid hydrogen from the shuttles 
external fuel tank to the main rocket engines 
about 100 to 200 tiny glass beads were found when the seals were 
disassembled along with some metal chips lenoir said nasa 
officials dont know how the debris got there 
parker hannifin corp which makes these parts called fuel 
umbilicals at one point was using the beads for other projects in 
the building where it made the shuttle parts lenoir said nasa 
doesnt plan to take action against the california company he said 
weve no evidence at all that says that something wrong has 
been done here that anybodys quality has escaped from us 
lenoir said 
nasa plans to improve its test procedures for the disposable 
external tanks to prevent similar problems in the future lenoir 
said 
inherently that makes it more expensive which is why we 
didnt in the first place he said weve no reason to believe 
that our acceptance test procedure was at fault or caused any 
problems were just trying to buy some more margin 
the space agency is designing a more efficient valve that should 
be ready in about two years lenoir said 
if largerthanallowable leaks are detected during fueling for 
the sept 1 launch the mission will be called off again lenoir 
said

riot police fired teargas and 
shotguns wednesday to break up student demonstrations that snarled 
traffic in panama city for several hours eight students were 
reported injured by gunfire 
students from all over the capital took to the streets to 
protest a supreme court ruling upholding a decision by the national 
institute to expel five of them for rowdy behavior 
the institute a high school dropped the students for taking 
part in a street demonstration two months ago that turned into a 
riot and featured the vandalism of local stores 
as a result of wednesdays demonstrations education minister 
ada gordon announced she had ordered the institute closed until 
security conditions are restored 
students at the institute told reporters at least 55 people were 
hurt during clashes with police but an official at the social 
security emergency room who identified himself only as dr soto 
said in a telephone interview he knew of only eight who were 
injured none seriously 
soto said the eight were treated for superficial shotgunpellet 
wounds and allowed to leave 
for hours the demonstrators tied up traffic along fourth of 
july avenue bordering the panama canal and other main 
thoroughfares 
students from the institute the university of panama the 
school of arts and at least a dozen other high schools threw rocks 
at police trying to redirect traffic until the riot squads appeared

took office eight months ago said he was getting fedup with 
student disturbances 
endaras predecessor dictator manuel antonio noriega was 
removed by a us military invasion in december and was flown to 
miami for on trial for drug trafficking and money laundering 
the government has been patient and has been acting with a 
very soft hand but it must also protect citizens rights to be on 
the streets he told reporters 
a few youths just cannot curb their right to transit or cause 
damage to property and society i am soft handed and i am glad that 
im softhanded but the time comes when one must act he added

troubleplagued nasa restored steady 
radio contact with magellan on wednesday after losing touch with 
the malfunctioning spacecraft for the second time since it started 
orbiting venus 
engineers received radio signals from magellan at about 433 
pm pdt showing that its secondary antenna obeyed computer orders 
and was firmly pointed at earth allowing them to maintain a 
continuous link with the wayward spaceship said tommy thompson 
magellan science manager at nasas jet propulsion laboratory 
it took a ton off our shoulders he said were going home 
with smiles on our faces 
intermittent contact had been restored at 1232 pm pdt when a 
brief blip of a radio signal was received by nasas deep space 
network tracking station in goldstone calif that was about 17 
hours after contact was lost tuesday night laboratory spokesman 
bob macmillin said 
you could hear cheers and clapping when we reacquired the 
signal thompson said 
in an attempt to prevent further communications breakdowns 
engineers were sending additional computer commands to magellan to 
disable some of its safety systems said thompson those systems 
cut off communications with earth on aug 16 and again tuesday 
night when they detected some unknown problem aboard magellan 
the spacecrafts 744 million mission to make the best pictures 
of venus yet had been scheduled to start the first week of 
september but likely will be delayed until the problem is 
diagnosed and fixed thompson said 
the patient is resting comfortably and is strong and healthy 
but needs an operation and we dont know which operation right 
now he said of magellan 
the spaceships first radio blip to earth on wednesday afternoon 
indicated the spaceship finally had accepted repeated computer 
commands to start spinning and send radio signals into space so 
that some of those signals reached earth he added 
engineers received more intermittent signals before sending 
magellan orders to stop spinning and keep an antenna aimed at 
earth those orders restored steady radio communications 
earlier national aeronautics and space administration officials 
expressed optimism they would overcome the problem 
i wouldnt say people are thrilled but nobodys panicking 
were very optimistic well be able to regain contact with the 
spacecraft figure out whats wrong and continue the mission 
ellen stofan assistant to magellans chief scientist had said 
the successful conclusion of magellans latest crisis averted 
at least temporarily another severe setback for nasa 
the agency temporarily grounded its shuttle fleet this summer 
due to hydrogen fuel leaks and also discovered the 15 billion 
hubble space telescopes performance was badly impaired by a flawed 
mirror 
planetary scientist steve wall said magellans radio signal 
fluttered in and out of contact before fading away tuesday night 
indicating an unknown problem made the spacecraft turn so the 
antenna it was using at the time no longer pointed at earth 
we do not believe anything like a massive failure occurred 
he said 
venus and magellan were almost 149 million miles from earth on 
wednesday wall said venus is earths nearest neighbor and is the 
second planet from the sun 
magellan was designed to use radar to peer through venus thick 
clouds to make the most detailed pictures and maps yet of the 
rugged landscape where temperatures reach 900 degrees fahrenheit 
due to an outofcontrol greenhouse effect 
the spacecraft was launched from the shuttle atlantis on may 4 
1989 then looped around the sun 1 times traveling 948 million 
miles before it slid into orbit around venus on aug 10 
magellan first lost contact with earth for more than 14 hours 
starting the night of aug 16 then its automatic safety systems 
made the spacecraft spin slowly while beaming radio signals across 
the skies until some reached earth 
that resulted in eight hours of intermittent communications 
then engineers sent commands that restored a steady radio link 
the safety systems didnt automatically make magellan start 
spinning when its radio link failed for the second time starting at 
7 pm tuesday wall said the signal fluttered for 13 minutes 
before fading out 
that happened less than eight hours after nasa released 
magellans first test pictures of venus the pictures showed that 
at least a small part of the planets surface has been violently 
shaped by quake faults and vast volcanic lava flows 
stofan said prime suspects as the cause of magellans 
communications problem are defects in its computer programs or its 
hardware 
engineers had said tuesday the leading theory to explain last 
weeks outage was that magellans electronics were briefly 
disrupted by a cosmic ray or a highenergy particle from the sun 
jet propulsion laboratory is known for designing spacecraft to 
fix their own malfunctions 
voyager 2s main receiving antenna failed after its launch in 
1977 leaving it deaf for about a week until the probe 
automatically switched to a working backup receiver laboratory 
spokesman jim wilson said the probe successfully completed a 
12year exploration of jupiter saturn uranus and neptune last 
year

if theyll be tapped 
if the call comes well go said jeffrey smith a new york 
city accountant and army reservist right now im a little 
nervous but i stand ready to go as everyone else does 
if you sign on the dotted line you have to expect to pay the 
piper said joseph bellavia a 43yearold pharmaceutical 
salesman from reading mass he said hes ready to go but his 
family including eight children doesnt want him to go 
president bush ordered the pentagon on wednesday to call 
military reserves to active duty for the first time in 20 years 
the callup includes national guard units and army navy air 
force and marine reserves guard troops sent previously to the 
middle east were responding to calls for volunteers rather than a 
federal callup 
officials didnt identify the units that would be activated or 
say when they would be called 
but a spokesman for north carolinas national guard said some of 
its units had been called into duty we are aware of units that 
have been called we are going through verification rosters said 
lt col baron hignite

bureau in washington told the 19th annual conference of the 
enlisted association of the national guard of the united states 
meeting in minneapolis

joined the army in april 1979 and did three years active duty hes 
been a reservist every since 
anybody who says theyre not scared theyre lying said 
smith 
on the other hand angela adinolfi 22 a reservist who works at

us embassy in tehran was 20 when he was freed since his return 
has has had frequent speaking engagements and has run 
unsuccessuflly for congress 
iowa national guard officials expected iowa units would be 
called up but said it would likely involve only a few troops 
i am not anticipating that we get word this afternoon and we 
leave tonight said warren lawson iowa national guard adjutant 
general who said officials generally provide for an orderly 
deployment 
this is what were all about its like being a volunteer 
fireman you hope theres never a fire but if there is one you 
know youre ready to deal with it said ray martyniuk a 
spokesman for new jerseys department of military and veterans 
affairs which oversees the army and air national guard 
were not doing anything special right now except for our 
normal business but our mission is to train for something like 
this said col alex garcia deputy commander of the 111th air 
defense brigade in new mexico which includes the 744th medical 
detachment 
some employers were taking stock of their personnel to determine 
the effect a callup might have on their workforces 
fhp health care of utah reported that as many as 45 of its 
employees could be called to active duty 
every department is looking at how this may affect them so 
they can be prepared we will strongly support our employees while 
they are there there is strong company support for the american 
and united nations positions said company spokesman james w 
mcpherson iii 
master sgt mary lou bornmann a spokeswoman at new york citys 
fort totten said many reservists have contacted their commanders 
volunteering for active duty fort totten is headquarters of the 
77th army reserve command 
weve had more people volunteering than we know what to do 
with she said i dont think anybody expected this now but

east german lawmakers ended their anguished 
and muchridiculed battle over the date of unification and early 
thursday voted to merge the foundering nation with west germany on 
oct 3 
parliament burst into applause when parliaments president 
sabine bergmannpohl announced the truly historic event 
after an 11hour parliament session that lasted until thursdays 
predawn hours lawmakers voted 294 to 62 to make oct 3 the day the 
nation becomes part of a single germany seven lawmakers abstained 
the date was a compromise between the major factions in 
parliament after weeks of battling that tore apart the broad 
coalition government of prime minister lothar de maiziere 
earlier lawmakers rejected a proposal by the small german 
social union party to unify immediately 
parliament also passed a treaty that will allow allgerman 
elections on dec 2 the west german parliament is to vote on the 
same treaty thursday easy passage is expected 
east germany in effect has approved a clause effective oct 3 
in the west germany constitution that allows former german lands to 
accede to the western nation 
it is a major psychological boost to a nation troubled by 
economic and political chaos 
de maiziere urged lawmakers to accept oct 3 as the historic day 
of german unity and end the seemingly pointless squabbling over 
whether unity should take place in august september or october 
many people have gotten the impression discussions over a date 
are more important to us than the solution of crucial problems 
he told parliament 
a binding commitment and an end to the discussion are long 
overdue he said 
the weekslong dispute was the result of a power struggle 
between the christian democrats of de maiziere and west german 
chacellor helmut kohl and the leftleaning social democrats in both 
nations 
the two parties are jockeying for the best political advantage 
heading into dec 2 elections for a united german government 
many lawmakers acknowledged the convoluted wrangling in recent 
days seemed to have lost relevance as average east germans struggle 
with rising joblessness and higher prices 
i ask you who even understands our desires asked gregor 
gysi head of the reformed communists the thirdlargest party in 
parliament 
the lawmakers met in special session to try to resolve 
differences over the date of unity 
the social democrats insisted it occur sept 15 as east 
germanys secondlargest party their approval is needed to pass a 
unification proposal 
de maizieres christian democrats on wednesday as a compromise 
proposed oct 3 as the merger date 
kohls conservative government said earlier in the day that 
unity could occur on east germanys oct 7 birthday or one day 
earlier 
kohl has been able to orchestrate most of the unity process 
he and de maiziere his east german ally previously backed 
merging the two countries on oct 14 but the social democrats 
balked 
the social democrats want unity quickly so west germany can more 
quickly assume direct responsibility for east germanys failing 
economy 
joblessness has been climbing since east germany converted to a 
free market on july 1 
the social democrats also want early unification so that kohl 
will be forced to admit the staggering costs of bailing out east 
germany and its 16 million residents this could cost the christian 
democrats at the polls in december 
west germany says it is crucial that unity not occur before the 
oct 12 meeting in new york city of foreign ministers from the 
35nation conference on security and cooperation in europe 
the meeting will cap a series of negotiations between the four 
world war ii allies the united states the soviet union britain 
and france and the two germanys on the global aspects of german 
unity 
west germany has proposed that the results of talks on 
international aspects of german unity be presented at the this 
meeting 
in those negotiations the soviet union dropped its opposition 
to nato membership for a united germany in exchange for a promise 
its troops in what is now east germany can remain there for up to 
four years also reached was an agreement that a united germany 
would not try to claim lands forfeited to poland after nazi 
germanys defeat in 1945 
unemployment has been climbing since east germany converted to a 
free market on july 1 factories have been unable to compete with 
an invasion of western products 
the debate over the pace of unification and the problems with 
the economy has led to the resignations or dismissals of six 
ministers in de maizieres cabinet the past week and the decision 
by the social democrats to leave his coalition 
in the end the compromise was agreed to by the social democrats 
and another party that earlier had left de maizieres coalition in 
the dispute the liberal faction

of money and was stranded 
thirtyfive members of the troupe headed for new york where a 
rival soviet circus promoter put up money to send them home the

problems with its tour promoter and its financial backers pulled 
out 
the group came to atlanta in may seeking to get its tour back

dormitories and church shelters while pursuing funds 
the circus animals were seized by creditors and are being held 
in new york 
the group left atlanta with airline tickets paid for by steven 
e leber a new york businessman who promotes the official moscow 
circus he said wednesday he is putting up about 50000 to get the 
circus members home and take care of some of their us financial 
problems 
leber said members of the bim bom circus asked him for help 
they were starving he said they were at the end of their 
rope

with his circus and its troubles were threatening the reputation

leber said he previously had helped 27 members of bim bom who 
had gone to las vegas return home leber and circus members at the 
airport didnt know how many of their colleagues planned to stay

nicaraguas legislature on wednesday 
defeated a bill from president violeta barrios de chamorro asking 
pardons for at least five men involved in the 1978 murder of her 
publisher husband 
the national assembly rejected by a 5130 vote with eight 
abstentions the bill submitted by mrs chamorro last thursday she 
had sought the pardons as part of her campaign to pacify her 
warscarred nation 
pedro joaquin chamorro the popular publisher of the afternoon 
newspaper la prensa was ambushed and shot to death by gunmen on a 
managua street on his way to work jan 10 1978 
the assassination set violent protests that rallied opposition 
groups around the leftist sandinista national liberation front the 
sandinistas then overthrew dictator anastasio somoza in july 1979 
and seized power 
a decade of war between the sandinistas and usbacked contra 
rebels followed in which tens of thousands died mrs chamorro 
succeeded sandinista leader daniel ortega on april 25 after 
winning elections in a rout three months earlier 
five men were arrested tried convicted and sentenced from 20 
to 31 years imprisonment for pedro joaquin chamorros murder which 
was widely believed to have been carried out on orders from the 
somoza regime 
but mrs chamorros bill as sent to the legislature could also 
extend pardons to suspects from the somoza regime who had planned 
the assassination 
until mrs chamorro took office la prensa was nicaraguas only 
opposition newspaper and her husband is still fondly remembered by 
people for exposing corruption and human rights abuses under somoza 
although the contra war has ended nicaraguans remain bitterly 
split over many national issues the economy is still in tatters 
and the sandinistas are the countrys single biggest party 
assembly speaker miriam arguello called for secret balloting 
wednesday so that the controversial pardon issue could be voted 
freely across party lines 
mrs chamorros 14party united national opposition coalition 
ranging on the political spectrum from hardline conservatives to 
communists and socialists holds 51 seats in the 92member 
legislature 
the sandinistas have 39 and the revolutionary movement union and 
the social christian party one each

former black panther revolutionary 
johnny spain who was freed from prison by a court order two years 
ago was formally found suitable for parole wednesday by a state 
panel 
but spains confusing struggle with state parole authorities 
isnt over one member of the panel that voted 21 to ratify his 
earlier release said she would refer his case to the full state 
parole board for review 
it is unclear what would happen if the parole board declared 
spain unfit for release since he has already been freed by a state 
judges order 
board of prison terms spokeswoman phyllis scott said her agency 
was considering the matter despite the court decisions because 
the board has never made a decision on suitability for parole and 
the board is responsible for determining suitability 
spain 41 who was originally imprisoned for a 1966 murder and 
was later involved in a bloody uprising at san quentin prison has 
taught at the university of california berkeley and stanford 
university and lectured elsewhere in the two years since his 
release 
he also works at a social service agency for the disabled and 
homeless in richmond 
following nearly two hours of deliberation david brown the 
chairman of the threemember parole panel said the ruling was 
largely because spain has functioned as a lawabiding and 
productive citizen since his release a state judge ordered him 
freed in 1988 after he served 21 years of his murder sentence 
panel member maureen oconnell cast the no vote 
spains attorney said after the hearing that oconnell also 
referred the issue to the full state parole board which triggers 
an automatic review of the panels decision 
during the hearing the prosecutions representative deputy los 
angeles district attorney mark vezzoni argued that spain shouldnt 
be paroled because he is capable of further violence 
americans are hopelessly romantic they glorify criminals with 
time the blood of their victims seems to turn to dust and blow 
away with time vezzoni told the panel 
but spain said he had demonstrated his suitability for parole 
he told the panel members he was irritated with some of their 
questions because they appeared antagonistic but he said he 
demonstrated his maturity by keeping his temper 
spains original conviction was for killing a man during a 
robbery attempt at a bus stop 
he allegedly was involved in an escape attempt on aug 21 1971 
with fellow san quentin inmate and black panther leader george 
jackson three prisoners including jackson and three guards were 
killed 
spain was convicted in 1976 of the murders of two guards 
although he didnt directly participate in the killings 
but the conviction was thrown out after federal courts found 
that spain didnt get a fair trial the state prison terms board 
which had previously cited the san quentin uprising in denying 
parole was told by the courts that it could no longer consider 
that 
spains attorney dennis riordan accused vezzoni of making 
thinly veiled references to the san quentin uprising at the hearing 
responding to questions from parole board members spain said he 
was remorseful about the murder disputed the panels 
characterization of him as a former drug abuser and blamed 
numerous prison conduct violations in the 1970s largely on being 
forced to wear restraints every time he left his cell

the national election board on wednesday 
barred former dictator jose efrain rios montt from running for 
president in elections scheduled for nov 11 
the conservative threeparty coalition supporting the retired 
generals candidacy has three days to appeal through the courts 
and rios montt said he will try to have the decision reversed 
we didnt expect this i didnt expect it but we are 
prepared to continue playing the game rios montt told a news 
conference after the ruling was announced 
he called it a decision by group of citizens who are unaware 
of what the true rule of law is 
election board director felix castillo milla announced the 
decision at a heavily guarded news conference he said the ruling 
was based on provisions in the guatemalan constitution 
in its resolution rejecting rios montts candidacy the election 
board said neither the head and leaders of a coup armed 
revolution or similar movement that has altered the constitutional 
order nor those who have assumed the head of government as a 
result can run for president or vicepresident of the republic 
the supreme court in a nonbinding opinion sought by congress 
last year said rios montt cannot be president or vice president 
because of a constitutional ban on the holding of those posts by 
people who assumed power in a coup 
rios montt took power after a march 1982 military coup that 
overthrew president fernando romeo lucas garcia as president he 
sent more than a dozen leftists before firing squads including 
five during a visit by pope john paul ii 
rios montt ruled until august 1983 when the army replaced him 
with gen oscar humberto mejia 
rios montt was nominated to run for president by the democratic 
institutional party national unity front and guatemalan republican 
front 
a bornagain christian rios montt campaigned on a tough 
lawandorder platform making a good showing in early polls among 
voters concerned about the countrys rising crime rate 
human rights workers have worried that rios montts 
eyeforaneye brand of justice would lead to further abuses in a 
country already plagued with them so far the only candidate 
qualified by the election board to run in the presidential race is 
former guatemala city mayor alvaro arzu irigoyen of the national 
advance party 
the election board has yet to rule on the applications of at 
least seven other candidates including jorge carpio nicolle whose 
name was submitted by the national center union and the national 
authentic central 
nicolle a journalist lost in 1986 to incumbent president 
vinicio cerezo 
candidates have until sept 12 to register the winner of the 
election will replace cerezo who succeeded mejia after being 
elected to a fiveyear term in january 1986 
there will be a runoff on jan 6 if no candidate wins a majority 
in the nov 11 election

trip to the persian gulf 
i think the degree of cooperation today in terms of us 
military presence and a collective security effort obviously is 
far greater than it has ever been before cheney said 
because the threat from iraq is so serious to the moderate arab 
rulers in the gulf region cheney said nations that previously

the fall of communism has brought a sense 
of unraveling to the balkans where the new democracy holds fragile 
sway over emotional peoples tormented by ancient ethnic hatreds 
longsuppressed nationalism and economic backwardness bedevil 
the transition throughout the former soviet bloc but nowhere is 
the danger of national dissolution or even armed conflict so great 
as in the balkans 
balkan peoples have little tradition of democracy and have 
endured centuries of brutal outside domination 
they are fiercely proud of their ethnicity and often settle 
scores in blood scars inflicted by the past are as fresh as if 
incurred yesterday the thirst for revenge runs deep 
the past hangs over the whole of politics as elsewhere in 
europe with the difference that in the balkans there has never 
been a juridical arrangement of all these matters said nikolai 
todorov one of bulgarias foremost experts on the region 
the heritage is very difficult to overcome because there are 
compact masses of nationalities which were included in new states 
built on the national principle he said alluding to such 
minorities as bulgarias 1 million ethnic turks the 2 million 
hungarians in romania and the scattered ethnic groups of yugoslavia 
before communism arrived balkan borders were shifted constantly 
by battles between outside rulers often in the names of their 
religions the orthodox south slavs the ottoman turks moslems who 
dominated the southern balkans for centuries and the hapsburgs 
roman catholics from the north 
in world war ii fought in most of europe as a struggle between 
democracy and dictatorship balkan countries gained and lost 
territory at the whim of outside powers in yugoslavia about 1 
million people were killed in largely fratricidal conflict 
as recently as 1989 old hatreds drove 300000 ethnic turks from 
bulgaria it was europes biggest emigration in 40 years 
balkan peoples accustomed to violence far from western europe 
and often isolated in mountain valleys even from one another 
traditionally have felt secure only in the very ethnic 
consciousness that nurtures more conflict 
religion a folk song ones land or village exercise a greater 
hold because they have proved more lasting than the different 
masters of this strikingly beautiful region 
added to the mystical sense of ethnicity are the legacies of 
great empires at one spot in central sofia an orthodox church a 
mosque a lenin statue and a sleek sheraton hotel face one another 
bulgarians must untangle a complex heritage of ottoman and 
soviet repression and orthodox acquiescence in the status quo in 
order to make reality of the very different jargon of democracy 
human rights and market economy 
new concepts of freedom and the watchword europe are 
invoked almost as if they could magically overcome the burdens of 
history and economic backwardness transforming the balkans 
instantly into france 
the political impossibility of such rapid change is obvious even 
in such tangibly european cities as ljubljana capital of slovenia 
the northern yugoslav republic next to austria and italy 
nationalism is only part of the problem a slovenian 
journalist said on condition of anonymity there is also the 
politics of small nations 
among the slovenes who number just under 2 million almost all 
prominent politicians businessmans journalists and intellectuals 
know each other graft and intrigue can flourish in such tight 
circles as they traditionally did in the hapsburg empire to which 
slovenia belonged for centuries 
circumstances like that make it difficult for the often 
europeanized intellectuals of the balkans to follow the east 
european tradition of doubling as farsighted politicians 
romania for instance has suffered since its revolution in 
december from the refusal of most leading intellectuals to join any 
political party 
an outspoken independent media virtually nonexistent in the 
balkans is just one aspect of democracy difficult to achieve 
the media often inflame passions rather than soothe them 
especially in yugoslavia whose fragile federation of six 
quarrelsome republics seems destined to dissolve 
a print war many fear will lead to shooting is being waged 
between serbia the largest republic and the only one where 
communist leaders refuse free elections and croatia which elected 
a centerright government in march 
serbia has demonstrated a readiness to get tough by its actions 
in kosovo a southern province that was the heart of ancient serbia 
and now is dominated by ethnic albanians serbia claims they seek 
union with neighboring albania 
at least 60 ethnic albanians have been killed in confrontations 
with security forces ethnic albanian media and institutions have 
been virtually eliminated 
such tactics by serbia have encouraged the efforts of relatively 
prosperous slovenia and croatia both roman catholic parts of the 
old hapsburg empire to draw away from the rest of yugoslavia 
repression in kosovo also could prove dangerous if democratic 
reform took hold in albania the provinces ethnic albanians about 
85 percent of the population then could press in earnest for union 
with brothers across the border 
romania and bulgaria face the problem of sharing power with 
minorities at the political level where daily life is largely 
determined 
bulgaria holds its first free local elections in october ethnic 
turks are expected to win in kurdzhali and other towns that were 
paralyzed this summer by strikes of ethnic bulgarians who feared 
turkish domination 
in romania local elections scheduled for next year could give 
hungarians control of transylvania the western region adjacent to 
hungary 
whether the romanian elections even will be held remains a 
question there are increasing rumors in bucharest that the army is 
preapring to take over 
economic chaos everywhere in the balkans feeds fears of a rapid 
slide away from democracy 
ante markovic the federal premier of yugoslavia has curbed 
inflation but the newly convertible dinar is overvalued and prices 
in some areas are higher than in austria although pay averages 
only 280 a month 
reduced soviet oil shipments and the latest middle east crisis 
have caused an energy crunch in bulgaria and romania both 
introduced rationing of sugar and other staples in august and 
everyone seems to expect a hard winter

three friends whose ethnic groups 
hate each other were having coffee together watching what little 
of the world passes by in this sleepy village on the hungarian 
border 
they chatted amiably a serb a croat and an albanian belying 
the centuriesold tendency of their fellows to be at each others 
throats for ethnic and religious reasons 
to yugoslav media and politicians the internal conflict is the 
culmination of a power struggle building since the death in 1980 of 
josip tito who founded communist yugoslavia and ruled it for 35 
years 
how it comes out will determine whether the six divergent 
republics stick together or yugoslavia becomes the first country in 
postwar europe to split up 
for mladen kresic the serb and his two friends tension is 
more personal who spits at whom and which old acquaintances turn 
their backs 
at this point its a confrontation between individuals its 
not a confrontation between two groups he said speaking of 
serbs and croats 
kresic a 44yearold auto mechanic said he could not recall 
another time when tension was so high in branjin vrh a mainly 
croatian village in a serbdominated area of croatia 
anything could happen he said and sighed 
serbs and croats are the two largest ethnic groups in 
yugoslavia relations between them have grown worse since croatia 
the secondlargest republic held free elections in april 
elections in three other republics this fall are expected to 
exacerbate ethnic tensions and political divisions 
the centerright croatian democratic union won croatias 
elections the communist leaders of serbia yugoslavias largest 
republic accuse the party of being too nationalistic 
abiding divisions lend heat to the debate 
croats ruled by the hapsburgs for centuries are roman catholic 
and write in latin script serbs dominated by ottoman turks for 
more than 500 years are orthodox and use cyrillic script 
media in the two republics argue everything from who killed who 
in the estimated 1 million deaths from fratricidal fighting during 
world war ii to how to divide economic spoils redraw borders or 
develop democracy 
we have to solve several problems at once said stjepo 
martinovic executive editor of fnesnik croatias main daily 
newspaper 
as in say czechoslovakia there are the questions of 
culture parliamentary democracy and a market economy 
but here we have two other big questions the position of the 
republics and the national question which hasnt been solved 
during the socialist period it officially didnt exist 
in beli manastir a serbian town down the road from branjin vrh 
judge tihomir stojanovic said there is no democracy there is 
only nationalism 
nationalist feeling rising throughout the old soviet bloc is 
particularly dangerous in yugoslavia where pockets of one 
nationality like croatias half million serbs are scattered 
through the feuding republics 
the idea of yugoslavia as a federation uniting the scattered 
southern slavic groups gave stojanovic and other serbs in croatia a 
feeling of security they could be yugoslavs first then serbs 
for croatians like neven jurica a leader of the croatian 
democratic union yugoslavia was an institution that denied croats 
full sovereignty over their affairs and money 
he confidently outlined plans for a new croatian constitution to 
be presented in october he has no doubt it will pass the croation 
parliament which his party dominates 
its a complete change of yugoslavia as it currently exists 
jurica said the yugoslav idea is only based on ideological 
theses it is definitely dead 
a new yugoslavia can be based only on a new agreement of common 
interests he said echoing the views of the new centerright 
government in neighboring slovenia 
to protect themselves from what they see as rising croatian 
nationalism many serbs living in croatia joined a new political 
party slobodan milosevic the communist leader of serbia even 
talks of demanding a border change to protect croatias serbs 
milosevic and the slovenes have quarreled for two years over 
democracy and serbias repressive treatment of the ethnic albanian 
majority in its province of kosovo the ancient serb heartland 
most political observers say the newer conflict between the 
serbian communist leaders and the new croatian government will 
decide yugoslavias fate 
in branjin vrh 17yearold dalibor hosovic a croat said he 
wished there were no differences but that weddings always make 
them clear 
when they sing a croatian song you see who is croat and who 
is serb its the expression on their faces

wolfram grimm was 20 when he 
signed on at the big potassium mine outside this grimy industrial 
city at 46 hes out of work like hundreds of thousands of other 
east germans 
i really dont know what im going to do now he said 
standing in a long line at the bitterfeld employment office i 
dont deserve this kind of treatment after 26 years of sweat and 
hard work 
chancellor helmut kohl of west germany promised no east german 
would be made worse off by the july 1 economic merger of the two 
countries 
whatever the promises there are people like grimm all over the 
formerly communist east hard workers who have been demoralized by 
losing their jobs and seeing prices of nearly everything zoom 
upward 
east german officials say more than 12 million people about 10 
percent of the working population are either out of work or on 
drastically reduced hours 
experts say east germany will climb out of its economic morass 
as inefficient plants close and capitalism takes hold thats 
little comfort to those being forced to make the first sacrifices 
in return for a promise of prosperity that could be years in coming 
social problems are growing in tandem with the hard times 
jobless youths loiter or lean against store fronts drinking 
vodka or beer 
crime was rare under the stalinists partly because of the 
fearsome secret police since abolished now regular police have 
trouble keeping up with theft alone 
its everything from pickpocketing to thieves cutting the 
straps of ladies pocketbooks said said dietmar kiehne police 
spokesman in bitterfeld 60 miles south of berlin these are not 
things we are accustomed to 
while old inefficient plants fail many east germans rise to 
the challenge of unification shops and businesses are springing up 
all over the country craftsmen who worked for stateowned 
enterprises now work for themselves 
budding capitalists face many obstacles however 
ingo jung helps run a used car lot in bitterfeld offering 
volkswagens bmws and other cars bought in west germany 
business was brisk in the first few days of economic union when 
his fellow east germans had wallets stuffed with west german marks 
but caution soon prevailed 
a lot of people are really afraid theyre going to lose their 
jobs so theyre cutting way back on what they spend jung said 
the economic woes are many 
western investors wary of antiquated heavily indebted 
operations are not rushing to help rescue east german companies as 
bonn had predicted 
industrial production is plummeting according to the west 
german central bank east german output in the second quarter of 
this year fell 95 percent from the same period a year ago 
coffee and electronic goods are cheaper since july 1 but prices 
of many basic goods have increased enormously west germanys 
economics ministry said east german bread prices rose 122 percent 
in a month and postal rates went up 230 percent 
workers are striking for job security and east germanys 
economic problems are beginning to burden west germany 
west germany already provides huge amounts of financial aid but 
more is needed bonn will have to provide an extra 45 billion to 
cover programs for the evergrowing number of jobless east germans 
initial west german predictions were that unemployment in the 
east would reach 440000 by the end of 1990 it now appears the 
number will surpass 1 million not including people on reduced 
hours 
highly industrialized cities like bitterfeld suffer most 
thousands of workers have been laid off or given short hours in its 
soft coal and potassium mines filmmaking factory and giant chemie 
ag chemical complex 
many big industries like chemie ag are in economic limbo along 
with their employees of its 16000 workers 5000 are on short 
hours 
the company has ecological as well as economic problems the 
bitterfeld complex formerly known as ckb has been one of europes 
worst polluters dumping raw chemical waste into streams that feed 
the elbe river 
it would cost a fortune to raise chemie ag to western 
environmental standards several of the complexs operations 
already have closed and others probably will follow 
company officials say staff will have to be cut drastically if 
it is to attract investors who can turn chemie ag into a 
profitable ecologically safe operation 
asked to assess the firms future company officer wolfgang 
koppehel said we think it will survive but certainly not 
without pain

there is a small village north of 
albuquerque where people wait all summer to hear a sirens wail 
it is a call to action for the indians of pueblo jemez renowned 
for their ability to fight wildfires somewhere there is a fire 
and the first ones to reach the towns community center will be 
hired to fight it 
everybody whether theyre naked or eating or whatever has to 
run thats when the physical training comes in handy said 
lawrence tosa who coordinates the jemez crews 
similar crews from navajo hopi apache zuni and smaller tribes 
are called upon each year as fires flare across the country 
wildfires that closed yosemite park for the first time in its 
history were battled by crews that included apaches from eastern 
arizona 
other recent california fires have been fought by northern 
cheyenne acoma santo domingo taos mescalero and navajo crews 
said dennis orrick fire intelligence officer for the state 
department of forestry and fire protection 
the indians do everything from digging fire lines to lugging 
water pumps 
theyre invaluable to us if they were not available wed 
have real difficulty finding other people to fill that void said 
lee singer public affairs officer for the cibola national forest 
theyre really known for their ability to work their 
endurance said ray kirgan a fire management officer for the 
bureau of indian affairs 
they come from the mountain region they are hunters they do 
woodcutting theyve fought bears in the woods they know how to do 
the work without being told its almost automatic he said 
kirgan 51 should know an apache firefighter for 30 years he 
still can pass the strenuous step test a physical fitness 
requirement 
indians always have been firefighters on their own land but it 
wasnt until after world war ii that they turned to firefighting 
for the us government as a source of income 
people were back from the war and employment was down said 
kirgan they were living off the land and they were trying to get 
some income so they started organizing 
the mescaleros apaches of southern new mexico were the first 
indian firefighters to be exported when they were sent to help 
battle a california fire in 1948 kirgan said the bureau of indian 
affairs trained them gave them hard hats and sent them to work 
alongside the forest service crews 
they were so good that other states just started calling 
kirgan said in new mexico each spring 150 to 200 mescalero 
apaches apply for firefighting jobs about 50 are hired and go 
through three days of training they then are on call 24 hours a 
day if called to a fire they may work 12 to 16hour shifts for 
14 days without a break base pay is 798 an hour 
its seasonal undependable and dangerous work but for indians 
like clemente toledo summer firefighting is an important source of 
income 
you make more money in fewer hours at a faster pace said 
toledo 32 who grows corn and chili on his farm and works at odd 
construction jobs like most indian reservations and pueblos jemez 
suffers high unemployment 
toledo slim and muscular is a crew boss responsible for 
coordinating about 15 men at a fire in five years he has been 
sent to fires in northern california tennessee west virginia and 
elsewhere 
he spent 29 days in oregon in 1988 there was a lot of work a 
lot of hours and the food was great we were there for 29 days on 
my two days of rampr i toured the coastline ate pizza and got 
tshirts made for the crew 
the jemez crews known as the eagles achieved national fame in 
the 1950s and 1960s when they were recognized as the top 
firefighters in the country 
there has been one major change since that time in jemez and 
elsewhere women began joining the firefighting ranks in the late 
1970s 
reyes panana 29 a mother of three who has been separated from 
her husband for more than a year joined the jemez roster this fire 
season after waiting for several years shes one of 15 women 
firefighters 
the issue of womens rights didnt influence her decision to try 
her hand at firefighting she said she just needed a job 
and the men dont treat the women firefighters any differently 
she said 
we enjoy ourselves when we get back to camp we talk to each 
other we share we work together she said 
when her grandfather died in 1982 panana a ninthgrade 
dropout looked for a way to feed and clothe her children she took 
up pottery which she sells to tourists but pottery doesnt bring 
in much money firefighting does 
at first my kids were scared for me to go to a fire 
they started crying that first fire she said 
they had heard about the deaths of four jemez firefighters in a 
1986 car accident at an idaho forest fire and they thought i 
wasnt going to come back she said 
now theyre excited because of the money ive been bringing 
home and the things ive been buying them i bought them bunkbeds 
clothes and shoes 
tosa said his firefighters dont get hazard pay or benefits and 
he wishes they did but hes quick to add if they went out 
there for the money they would sit around all day doing nothing 
and get the same money 
they are professionals they have pride in what theyre doing 
its a family sort of attitude they all put in the same effort 
he said 
the only reward i really hope for and pray for is to bring all 
my people home standing on their own two feet and the faces i see 
on payday

they consider themselves modernday 
disciples of jesus christ but they wear cloth of a different kind 
tshirts jeans tattoos and harleydavidson motorcycles are 
their priestly uniforms and spreading the word of god to outlaw 
bikers is their mission 
guy girratono robert kaps and the rev dale crofford have been 
bikers since their youth and each has had his share of trouble 
girratono served time for armed bank robbery and assault 
crofford served time for assault with intent to kill kaps rode 
aimlessly around oklahoma moving from one job to another 
it wasnt until they reached the lowest point in their lives 
that they found god they say through people who cared in 
turn they seek to bring jesus into the hearts of motorcycle gangs 
i just have a real heart for these people i lived that life 
in my younger years and i got saved said the bearded crofford 
dressed in a harleydavidson tshirt jeans and heavy work boots 
an outfit similar to what he wears when he preaches to his 
congregation at the wellington holy christian fellowship church in 
wellington mo 
i believe that you can be a christian and be you and this is 
what i am said crofford 48 when not preaching crofford works 
in a motorcycle shop in the kansas city area 
i just believe that these guys and girls out there need to 
know that god loves them exactly where theyre at he said we 
can be christians ride motorcycles love god and still dress this 
way 
for years crofford wore a suit and tie on the pulpit but felt 
awkward 
what does a preacher look like anyway i dont know he 
saidi believe that if saint peter would have lived in this day 
and age he would have been a biker thats the kind of man he was 
the three men spend many weekends attending bikers rallies 
across missouri they hold outdoor services each contributing his 
unique talent 
crofford knowledgeable about the bible preaches the gospel 
kaps a baritone sings the hymns girratono a diplomat of sorts 
preaches and uses his contacts with gang leaders to give the three 
a safe haven in the bikers camps 
girratono 51 said he has spent years cultivating the leaders 
of outlaw bike clubs in kansas city so the three can move freely 
within those circles 
i can move in their rallies in their groups in their 
festivities without a threat of reprisal of any kind girratono 
said they know me they respect me and i have their blessing so 
to speak 
some biker gangs treat their ministry with indifference others 
with curiosity 
ive had some who have come to me and cried crofford said 
ive had some who have come to me and said i want to change but 
i dont know how ive had some whove said im not going to go 
to a religious blanketyblank church 
the important thing is that were there to help if they have a 
need 
during many bikers rallies club members often indulge in drugs 
and alcohol girratono said we want to introduce them to a 
better way of life a life free from the bondage of alcohol or 
drugs and illicit sex 
once a biker shows an interest in their message the second part 
of their mission begins preparing bikers to withstand persecution 
and getting mainstream churches to accept them tattoos and all 
even if a person comes to christ from this biking community 
for that man to walk into a church next sunday morning and sit down 
and receive the word of god like anybody else off the street is not 
going to happen in most cases girratono said 
we hope to give them a good enough grounding so they are not 
hurt their emotions are very delicate 
the three also hope to convince mainline churches to receive 
these kinds of people rejection by the church is a familiar and 
painful feeling for kaps 
lonely and down on his luck at the age of 19 kaps walked into a 
tulsa okla church looking as he does today wearing a ragged 
tshirt jeans and work boots 
one of the church members told him to clean up and put on a tie 
he was taken by the elbow and escorted out of the church 
it was some time before he made his way back to a church 
when not attending bikers rallies the three often participate 
in community activities to benefit the less fortunate 
in march they joined more than 450 bikers on a 100mile charity 
ride to benefit the homeless the bikers donated more than 23000 
to the city union mission in kansas city a privately funded 
homeless shelter

george bush was running for president and vice 
president while jimmy carter struggled with the hostage stalemate 
in iran now facing an even more perilous hostage crisis bush 
clearly is mindful of policy pitfalls he saw and criticized a 
decade ago 
while there are parallels there is a major difference in 
confronting iraq the administration has international backing 
arab allies and united nations sanctions carter didnt 
this persian gulf crisis began over iraqs invasion of kuwait 
and developed into a hostage situation as well president bush 
dropped the semantic shield on monday and said that foreigners 
detained in kuwait and iraq clearly are hostages until then the 
administration had avoided using the word 
i will hold the government of iraq responsible for the safety 
and well being of american citizens held against their will bush 
said the carter administration had held iran responsible for the 
tehran hostages taken when radical students stormed and seized the 
us embassy 
that crisis began exactly one year before the 1980 election that 
carter lost to ronald reagan iran freed the hostages as president 
reagan and vice president bush took office in 1981 the stalemate 
dominated carters last year in office and became a politically 
crippling symbol of impotence the carter administration fashioned 
the deal that got them out reagan got the benefit 
the bush administration wants no replay in this middle east 
confrontation 
carter stuck close to the white house early in the embassy 
hostage crisis bush clearly is determined that he will not be 
confined to quarters because of the situation in the persian gulf 
so he is vacationing aggressively golfing fishing boating at 
kennebunkport maine between crisis conferences and telephone 
calls bush also is campaigning for republicans in this falls 
elections 
its important for the american people to see that hes not 
holed up in the white house as has happened in the past press 
secretary marlin fitzwater said recalling carters reaction to the 
seizure of the tehran embassy hostages 
in 1980 bush criticized carter for not acting sternly enough 
soon enough against iran as a candidate for the republican 
presidential nomination he became a prime critic of the democratic 
white house breaking out of what had been an informal political 
truce on the hostage issue 
he advocated economic warfare against iran a break in 
diplomatic relations and military action he supported the rescue 
mission ordered by carter even though it had failed i hope he 
takes further action and i hope he takes it today bush said 
after the abortive rescue attempt 
he favored sanctions said he would support a blockade 
some of the steps bush urged upon the democratic white house 
then are steps taken now against iraq for its takeover of kuwait 
an economic embargo chief among them some are not options this 
time 
in this hostage crisis the regime of saddam hussein is 
scattering americans and other westerners at military and 
industrial sites that could be targets in an air strike trying to 
use captured civilians as a shield against attack 
the sheer number of civilians and their dispersal rule out the 
kind of rescue mission carter attempted in the spring of 1980 a 
helicopter raid that was supposed to free 53 americans held at the 
us embassy in tehran but never got there 
there are more than 3000 americans in kuwait about 530 in 
iraq among some 21000 westerners 
so long as the iraqi hostage crisis remains a crisis president 
bush is likely to hold his broad public support for the way hes 
handling it an nbc newswall street journal poll conducted 
saturday and sunday put approval at 72 percent 
but that public backing can erode when todays crisis drags into 
tomorrows long tormenting standoff 
and the taking of hostages is a formula for stalemate 
so it has been in the case of the six americans still held 
hostage by moslem radicals in beirut so it was when the embassy 
hostages were taken captive in tehran on nov 4 1979 
president carter has had a fourmonth ride on the crest of 
public support for whatever he did dealing with the iranian hostage 
crisis candidate bush said in 1980 that period is now 
coming to an end 
in the broader persian gulf crisis bush could face the same 
problem 
when carter tried to get action at the united nations bush 
noted at the time it proved impotent but eastwest contention has 
eased the cold war era is over and the bush administration is 
working throughheasures to enforce the embargo while seeking 
international backing 
bush said there are hard choices ahead and the situation could 
get tougher 
campaigning as reagans vice presidential nominee in 1980 bush 
said the tehran embassy hostages were still in captivity that fall 
because of carters failed foreign policy he did not try to spell 
out a way out i have no specific answer nor am i empowered to 
come up with one he said that fall 
he is now

gary franks is just the type of person 
you would expect to run for congress high school basketball star 
yale graduate real estate developer and city alderman 
but hes also black and a republican a combination that hasnt 
been seen in the house for more than half a century 
franks is one of three black republicans trying to break the 
jinx this year the others are former cincinnati councilman j 
kenneth blackwell in ohios open 1st district and louisville 
businessman al brown who is challenging rep romano l mazzoli in 
kentuckys 3rd district 
basically the whole republican philosophy is selfhelp 
said franks 37 it worked for his family he said and is far 
preferable to dependence on welfare or other government programs 
franks is the youngest son of a mill worker who moved from north 
carolina to work in waterburys brass factories his mother is a 
lifelong republican and he speaks often of his family when he 
explains how he came to his views on selfsufficiency 
my father came here about 55 years ago from north carolina 
franks said he had a sixthgrade education barely could read 
barely could write and my parents raised six children i have 
three sisters who hold doctorate degrees today 
the last black republican in the house was oscar de priest of 
chicago who was elected in the hoover landslide of 1928 and served 
three terms 
the predominantly working class district franks hopes to 
represent is only 4 percent black and he is up against a 
wellknown democrat former congressman and tv anchor toby moffett 
but no one is discounting the threeterm alderman who has won 
respect from democrats and republicans alike during his tenure 
of the three black republicans running for congress this year 
franks is the only one seeking a seat that has been held by a 
republican during the 1980s the incumbent gop rep john rowland 
is running for governor 
rowlands coattails are expected to help franks as is franks 
strong base in waterbury and an infusion of support from the 
national party 
voters in connecticuts 5th district a mixture of small towns 
suburbs and old industrial cities couldnt have a clearer choice 
franks is a fiscal conservative who preaches the virtues of the 
work ethic and the evils of a federal tax increase he favors a 
constitutional amendment to ban flagburning and supports a womans 
right to choose an abortion 
i believe in less government he said recently i believe 
that we dont have to tax and spend constantly to maintain our 
society 
moffett 46 went to congress as a naders raider with the 
watergate class of 1974 and served four terms before two 
unsuccessful bids for statewide office us senate in 1982 and 
governor in 1986 
moffett took a job as a television anchorman in hartford after 
his 1986 defeat when he moved into the 5th district to run for 
rowlands seat he immediately became the frontrunner despite 
being labeled a carpetbagger by opponents within and outside the 
party 
when i see mr moffett i think of the 70s said franks 
you think of jimmy carter you think of interest rates at 21 
percent you think of an unemployment rate of over 7 percent 
jay marlin moffetts campaign manager turns the tables by 
tying franks and his fiscal ideas to the reagan economic record 
if he wants to take credit for the reagan years he can take 
credit for a tax cut for the wealthy that hurt the middle class 
for the greatest deficits in history and for the savings and loan 
crisis marlin said 
that franks even won the gop nomination is considered a small 
miracle in waterbury he needed nine ballots at the partys 
convention last month to get its endorsement on the first six 
ballots he finished dead last 
but republican strategists say franks has a good chance of 
beating the betterknown moffett in a district where there are 
roughly 97000 registered democrats 83000 republicans and 107000 
unaffiliated voters 
from a purely political point of view hes from the right 
place waterbury said john mastropietro who is managing 
rowlands campaign for governor its extraordinarily difficult 
for a democrat to win the district without winning waterbury

as part of nbcs preseason double pump of 
six new series ferris bueller a highschool sitcom destined 
for mondays gets its first pump tonight 
let us all stand now and say like wow 
true the newcomer may be overshadowed by tonights real drama 
how a rerun of foxs the simpsons fares in the shows new 
thursday slot against outtakes and highlights from nbcs reigning 
champ the cosby show 
but ferris based on ferris buellers day off the 1986 
movie that starred matthew broderick probably will do well in the 
nielsens tonight because its appearing right after cosbys special 
a dramatization of the phone book would get high ratings there 
but nbc might be better off with the phone book perhaps 
starting with the name mahatma kane jeeves 
this ferris about a highschool junior who uses charm and 
wit to glide through life is a case of noshow 
it stars charlie schlatter who vaguely resembles a younger 
emilio estevez like george burns when he had a series and gary 
shandling during his nbcs ferris talks to the audience before and 
after his scenes 
well nbc is trying to avoid the traditional 
nbcs ferris starts tonights previewdebut by acknowledging the 
movie that gave birth to this series matthew broderick as me 
he asks with a sly grin holding up a lifesize carboard poster of 
the star 
no way hes too whitebread too twodimensional 
armed with a chainsaw he saws off the posters head and half of 
one shoulder having sardonically noted this is television this 
is real 
well that sure is a kneeslapper as are his introductions of 
his older sister jennifer aniston his parents cristine rose and 
sam freed and his hypochondriac best friend brandon douglas 
ferris is given to sayings like my life consists of two 
states of consciousness un and sub 
but mom gets off a snappy line now and then as when she tells 
her daughter a little less makeup jeannie youre going to 
school not the mall 
you may be surprised to learn this show is set in southern 
california 
naturally he and his sister attend a high school near the 
beach this is so ferris can cut class to go to the beach and maybe 
audition for baywatch or something 
the school of course has a mean principal richard riehle he 
is so dim he grimaces whenever ferris outwits him but this is 
because nbc is trying to avoid the traditional 
viewers who stay beyond the first monologue will find tonights 
show revolves around the first day of school and a beautiful 
transfer student ami dolenz for whom ferris goes bonkers in his 
sophisticated teen way 
they also will find hes one of those kids who is ahead 
he can computerhack false attendance records provide teacher 
parking passes to students change the school lunch menu swing a 
stretch limo or even send the principal through a trap door with 
just the touch of a button 
and by neddies hes also glib but hes not the only one whos 
fast upstairs when the principal tells his sister shes late and 
snarls know that that means she fires right back with this 
yeah i wont go to heaven 
all things considered this show is the malibu version of 
situation comedy surfs up wits down

his body is crippled and his voice a whisper 
but sanford meisner goes on 
meisner turns 85 on friday aug 31 less than a week after 
public televisions american masters profiles the man regarded 
as one of the countrys best acting teachers 
the only time im enjoying myself is when im teaching he 
says and that enjoyment has lasted more than 50 years 
for some five decades meisner has taught acting at the 
neighborhood playhouse in new york not as well known as lee 
strasberg uta hagen or stella adler he has been called the 
theaters bestkept secret 
but not to his pupils the list of devoted meisner disciples is 
impressive joanne woodward robert duvall gregory peck tony 
randall eli wallach anne jackson peter falk gwen verdon and 
more 
what he wanted from you was truthful acting peck recalls in 
the television tribute and the proof of that is the number of 
people that have come out of there who set standards of 
acting themselves and changed a great deal about american acting 
today physical ailments have slowed but not stopped meisner an 
auto accident in 1984 smashed his left leg and hip cancer of the 
larynx robbed him of his voice more than 10 years ago but he 
learned to speak again by inhaling air into his esophagus and 
forcing out sounds 
still meisner loves to talk about acting dissecting what it is 
and isnt 
i have a definition which i use meisner said the other day 
during an interview acting is the ability to live truthfully 
under imaginary circumstances 
the ability to learn lines is not enough he said actors have 
to make the text come to life 
only the actor knows how to find the truth inside himself and 
out of which comes the reality of the text my job is to help with 
exercises which permit whats going on inside to come to the 
surface 
meisner teaches in new york los angeles and on the caribbean 
island of bequia where he has a home each summer he holds two 
fourweek sessions in bequia for 25 older more professional 
students if they make it through these workshops the students go 
to california for a twoyear course that begins in november and 
ends in may 
he has little use for rules about acting and scoffs at 
intellectual theorizing about the craft 
acting is doing and meaningful acting is doing under 
emotional circumstances he says 
in new york meisner heads the acting department at the 
neighborhood playhouse he gets all the new students usually 
between 75 and 100 in september each day these green recruits 
have to go through a series of exercises mostly dealing with the 
development of spontaneity and concentration later there are 
classes on character development in november he turns them over 
to teachers he has trained himself 
when meisner teaches he uses a microphone to amplify his raspy 
often indistinct voice but his opinions are as clear and sharp as 
ever 
todays students are somewhat vulgar he said maybe its 
television they dont have much grounding in the theater and what 
they do know is superficial everyone just wants to make money and 
thats in television 
meisner was born in brooklyn the son of hungarian immigrants 
he was groomed to become a furrier like his father but he 
discovered the theater at age 19 and didnt look back instead he 
became an actor 
meisner was one of the founding members of the influential group 
theater led by harold clurman lee strasberg and cheryl crawford 
and which was a major force on broadway in the 1930s he appeared 
in some of the companys biggest hits including men in white 
awake and sing and golden boy 
meisner began teaching at the neighborhood playhouse while a 
member of the group theater the company folded in 1941 but meisner 
kept teaching at the playhouse and only occasionally made 
appearances on stage his screen appearances are also rare hes 
best known for his work in the films the story on page one and 
tender is the night 
but he urges his pupils to do all kinds of work especially 
plays if they want to improve at their craft 
acting is fun he says on the television show dont let 
that get around

for songwriter oliver leiber 
something as simple as the title to a cheap novel can inspire a hit 
single 
stuck once when his car broke down leiber killed time at a 
secondhand bookstore flipping through the covers of horrible 
cheesy drugstore romance novels then a title grabbed him 
opposites attract 
that was enough to give him the gist of a funky song that 
eventually became a no 1 smash for singer paula abdul 
i look at a title as the complete picture in a way this is 
what im building up to this is the big payoff said leiber who 
also wrote and produced abduls hits its just the way that you 
love me and forever your girl 
so if this title is the payoff how did i get there and what 
is going to make that feel like a payoff 
titles are not the only things that come to leiber by accident 
the son of rock and roll hall of fame lyricist jerry leiber he 
originally wanted to be a session drummer in new york city but 
after coming to minnesota in 1983 for chemical dependency 
treatment he stayed to play drums and guitar for local bands 
if you had told me that i would go to minneapolis minnesota 
and thats where i would make it in music that would have been the 
most ludicrous idea to me said leiber who grew up in manhattan 
these days though hes not entirely comfortable with his 
thoughts of living part of the year in los angeles i associate 
so much of my success and the good stuff thats happened with being 
here he said i get scared that somehow im going to lose 
whatever it was 
in some senses the 29yearold leiber is following the lead of 
his father who with composer mike stoller wrote such 1950s 
classics as jailhouse rock and kansas city 
i dont think i would have been a writer or a musician if i 
wasnt his son he said i think i went into that for that 
reason 
but the younger leiber whose hoop earrings and reddish 
dreadlocks give him a bohemian look never had lengthy walks on 
the beach with his father to discuss the art of songwriting 
there was no sitting on his lap and this is how you do it 
son none of that he said 
while his father was from the old school of songwriting 
yellow manila pad bottle of hennessy three packs of camel 
straights late at night oliver leiber has a more modern 
approach 
after recording an instrumental track in the basement studio of 
his suburban home leiber will pop the tape into his car stereo 
cruise around and sing along into a microcassette recorder 
theres something about motion for me and not being stagnant 
and sitting and not being at home and not having the phone ring or 
the dog wanting to play that creates a certain freedom he said 
leiber worked with his father and brother jed on la 
la a song heard in the 1985 movie to live and die in la 
three years later obsessed the first record leiber wrote and 
produced by himself was featured in the movie bright lights big 
city 
he then collaborated with twin cities singer st paul on the 
single rich man abdul was choreographing the video for rich 
man in los angeles when she heard a tape of its just the way 
that you love me and flipped over the tune according to 
leiber 
dan brennan leibers manager at the time got that song and two 
others forever your girl inspired by leibers exgirlfriend 
from fargo nd and originally titled small town girl and 
opposites attract placed on abduls 1988 debut album leiber 
produced all three songs which became hit singles abdul calls 
leiber my hero in her albums liner notes 
leiber seeks inspiration from hooks short catchy phrases a 
title can come from something overheard in the studio or from a 
dictionary of cliches he consults he likens songwriting to a 
reverse process of connectthedots 
i sort of have the picture and i backtrack and i go how did 
i get here what are the steps that are going to make this thing 
work he said 
simplicity is the key to a good pop song leiber said if you 
really cant say it in a sentence youve got too much going on 
a big fan of his fathers songs leiber remembers what his 
father told him about success he used to say to me when youre 
it youre just it the minute you start thinking what was it i 
did how can i be it the moment has already passed

youre watching an interesting documentary on 
pollution of a kentucky river switch channels and come back a few 
minutes later to find a yuppie rap video on the same station 
dont worry theres nothing wrong with your set its just tom 
weinberg testing the limits of television 
weinberg is executive producer of the 90s an hourlong 
showcase of independent videotape makers and producers that zips 
through topics such as politics religion the environment and 
culture at a pace designed to dazzle but never bore its viewers 
the weekly collage now in its second run of 13 shows is sent 
to more than 90 public and cable television stations across the 
country many of them run it between 10 pm and midnight 
the time slots dont seem to bother weinberg and his cohorts 
who are having fun with their latest attempt to alter the message 
and the medium 
part of it is we want to change the world in ways that make it 
more fun more humane more responsive says weinberg 46 who 
has a 1960s social conscience and a 1990s love for technology 
part of it is that its an incredibly absorbing pastime the 
process of making tv 
the television theyre making is not like standard commercial 
television or the other avantgarde shows on public stations the 
advent of a new generation of inexpensive but sophisticated video 
cameras has enabled tvquality production of unconventional 
lowbudget pieces and even amateur contributions 
one program includes panamanians speaking out about the us 
invasion of their country a look at the destruction of brazilian 
rain forests and a segment on residents of a chicago public housing 
project 
another includes a report on prochoice and antiabortion forces 
demonstrating outside a los angeles abortion clinic a fathers 
conversation with his cerebral palsystricken daughter a wacky 
piece on three women who call themselves the advice ladies and 
offer their wisdom free on the streets of new york city and a 
caustic look at pat boone and a minister reminiscing about boones 
miracle rescue from a bad investment 
segments can run from 10 seconds to 10 minutes the material is 
cut spliced and interposed with graphics at the whim of the 
producers 
its very different rougher says kevin harris program 
director for public television stations wgbh and wgbx in boston 
the subject matter is really all over the place 
weinberg says viewers are supposed to enjoy the show at whatever 
level they can understand and appreciate 
theres a lot of nuance and you interpret it differently than 
i do he says 
he and his small staff produce the 90s in a small downtown 
office filled with overnight delivery envelopes and stacks of 
videotapes they sift through 30 to 40 tapes a week 
the works come from many sources independent producers looking 
for an outlet for their work unsolicited contributions and 
correspondents under contract to produce segments for the program 
the finished product is presented to the public television 
system by sponsoring station kbdi in denver the home of weinberg 
colleague john schwartz whose screen credit is chief 
bureaucrat it also is fed via satellite to cable stations 
the first 13 episodes were fed in november through january with 
a commitment to be run on 25 pbs stations a 350000 grant from a 
corporation for public broadcastingpublic broadcasting service 
fund will ensure a third season with at least 13 new shows and a 
broader pbs audience weinberg says 
grants from the john d and catherine t macarthur foundation 
helped the show get started 
weinberg a chicago native with a penchant for cigars greasy 
cheeseburgers and the chicago white sox got an mba from new york 
university in the late 60s and worked at the family bakery before 
getting involved in video in the early 70s 
he helped found tvtv a group of filmmakers and producers who 
made their mark with a pair of video documentaries about the 1972 
democratic and republican national conventions that gained critical 
notice 
later he helped found the center for new television a 
notforprofit haven in chicago that provides resources for video 
producers 
weinberg also created image union a locally produced 
awardwinning pbs program featuring short works by independent 
filmmakers and producers 
weinberg might be doing something that no one else is but he 
might not be able to reach mass audiences 
there is so little invention and so much convention in 
television says j fred mcdonald curator of the museum of 
broadcast communication in chicago there is not much room for 
artistry in an inventive sort of way 
harris says the 90s will never capture a large audience 
even on public television 
if it really was broad enough to get a lot of exposure it 
wouldnt be the kind of show it is he said 
but others believe weinberg may yet win the influence he wants 
and just might influence what people are doing on television

the sinking of the uss indianapolis and the 
subsequent courtmartial of its captain constitute the us navys 
worst moral disaster as well its worst sea disaster said the 
author of a new book on the affair 
journalist dan kurzman author of fatal voyage contends 
capt charles mcvay was made a scapegoat to mask mismanagement by 
high navy officials in the tragedy that claimed 880 lives in the 
closing days of world war ii 
a japanese submarine torpedoed the unescorted cruiser in the 
western pacific ocean on july 30 1945 after the ship had 
delivered components for the hiroshima atomic bomb to tinian island 
in the northern marianas 
for five days survivors clung to a few life rafts or bobbed in 
life jackets as dehydration exposure and swarming sharks killed 
hundreds of their companions military officials did not know the 
ship had gone down and the survivors were found by chance 
mcvay a highly decorated admirals son became the first 
captain ever tried by the us navy for losing a ship in battle 
in a highly publicized courtmartial he was found guilty of 
gross negligence for failing to maintain his ship on a zigzag 
or antisubmarine course even though mcvays orders did not 
require him to zigzag 
i think he was railroaded theres no other word for it they 
simply wanted to protect their own necks kurzman said in a 
telephone interview from new jersey 
fortyfive years later mcvays family is still fighting to 
clear his name kurzman hopes his book will help them 
kurzman conducted more than 100 interviews and reviewed 
thousands of navy documents to write his tale of mcvay and the 
horrifying days his men spent in the ocean between guam and the 
philippines the torpedo hits sank the indianapolis within 15 
minutes and about 800 of the ships 1196 crewmen were able to 
abandon ship the cruiser sent an sos but its radio apparently had 
been knocked out 
the men initially were confident of rescue but watched in 
frustration as planes passed high overhead without spotting them 
for the most part they were without food or fresh water 
delirium set in after a day and some men began attacking other 
survivors others died in agony after drinking sea water some 
believing there was a spigot with fresh water several feet down 
tore off life jackets and dove down never to resurface still 
others swam toward imaginary islands or dove to underwater hotels 
at night sharks would swim off with dozens of the men leaving 
only bloody streaks on the oily water 
no one thought to check for the indianapolis when it failed to 
arrive at leyte and no highlevel navy officer was disciplined for 
failing to respond 
survivors might never have been found had not a plane on an 
antisubmarine patrol spotted an oil streak left by the sunken 
ship only 316 men survived the ordeal 
kurzman said navy officials desperate for a scapegoat quickly 
fixed blame on mcvay son of former us asiatic fleet commander 
adm charles mcvay ii 
against the recommendation of adm chester nimitz commander in 
chief of the us pacific fleet who said mcvays failure to 
order a zigzag course was an error in judgment but not of such 
nature as to constitute gross negligence secretary of the navy 
james forrestal ordered that mcvay be courtmartialed 
kurzman said his book contains new information proving that 
mcvay was wrongly tried he uncovered a navy document that admits 
the charge of failing to zigzag probably had nothing to do with the 
loss of the ship one memo characterized the charge as 
supertechnical 
testimony by the japanese sub commander flown in from japan by 
the prosecution and an expert witness for the defense suggested 
that zigzagging probably would not have saved the indianapolis 
the navy had information that four japanese submarines were 
operating between guam and the philippines one had sunk the 
destroyer uss underhill six days earlier kurzman said that 
information could have alerted mcvay to be more cautious but it 
never reached the captain or the routing officers on guam who sent 
the indianapolis out unescorted 
the information was kept under wraps for security reasons 
kurzman said 
kurzman said information that might have cleared mcvay was 
edited out of public documents and the navy has refused to release 
it 
found by the navy to be unfit to ever command a vessel again 
mcvay was assigned to a shore job in new orleans he was 
transferred to the retired list in 1949 with the rank of rear 
admiral because of earlier combat citations but he never escaped 
the ghosts of the indianapolis he was haunted by letters and 
telephone calls from dead crewmens relatives who blamed him for 
their loved ones deaths 
my father hated to open his mail on any given holiday said 
his son kimo wilder mcvay a promoter in honolulu usually these 
cards said something like if it werent for you my son brother 
etc would be with us this easter christmas fathers day etc 
the elder mcvay plagued by a number of personal problems shot 
himself in the head with his service revolver in the front yard of 
his litchfield conn home in 1968 
a white house assistant told kimo mcvay in 1983 that no 
authority exists for the secretary of the navy to change the 
findings of the courtmartial and said presidential pardons are not 
awarded posthumously 
their argument is theres no precedent but theres no 
precedent to the fact that hes the only us captain 
courtmartialed for losing a ship in battle that isnt 
democracy kurzman said if theres no machinery then create 
it

greek orthodox archbishop iakovos has instructed 
priests at worship services this sunday to read an encyclical from 
the ecumenical patriarch urging protection of the natural 
environment 
unfortunately mankind in our day under the influence of an 
extreme rationalism and hedonism has lost the sense of the sanctity 
of the created world says patriarch dimitrios i of 
constantinople 
the teaching letter says this violation of natures laws is 
not for the fulfillment of basic human needs but aims at 
satisfying increasing appetites and desires encouraged by the 
dominant philosophy of a consumer society 
dimitrios considered first among equals among leaders of 
worldwide eastern orthodoxy says the result of continued abuse of 
natures gifts will be ultimate selfdestruction for 
humanity 
setting sept 1 as a special day for prayers for the 
deliverance of creation from harm inflicted by human hands 
the letter urges protection of the natural world which god 
created in all its its beauty

east european baptist church leaders 
have appealed for overseas help in responding to a spiritual 
hunger awakened by recent political changes in their countries 
the door is open for evangelism said soviet baptist union 
leader gregory komendant who led a 156member soviet delegation to 
the 16th baptist world congress in seoul 
komendant said the political changes initiated by soviet 
president mikhail gorbachev have created an unbelievable 
spiritual hunger but he said evangelism will not be easy in the 
soviet union mainly because of a lack of books facilities and 
funds 
komendant and other church leaders from east european nations 
said religious freedom and civil rights have greatly improved in 
their countries with western evangelists now allowed to come 
freely 
the sixday seoul congress drew about 10000 baptist church 
leaders including 200 delegates from east europe it was sponsored 
by the usbased baptist world alliance which claims 36 million 
followers in 145 countries

religious forces often critical of us military expeditions 
have indicated general support for americas intervention in the 
present middle east crisis 
they see the situation as different in this case although they 
like most others in and out of government hope for a nonviolent 
solution 
protestant eastern orthodox roman catholic and jewish 
representatives have backed in principle president bushs stand 
against iraqs invasion of kurwait including steps to resist it 
the national council of churches including most major 
protestant and eastern orthodox denominations denounced the 
unjustifiable act of aggression by iraq against kuwait adding 
the council supports the demands of the international 
community for a speedy and complete withdrawal of iraqi forces 
those demands have included united nations sanctions against 
iraq and sending of multinational forces including those of the 
us to prevent an iraqi military drive into saudi arabia 
although the council and many religious leaders have strongly 
criticized some past us military initiatives such as in panama 
granada and military aid in central america that hasnt happened 
this time 
one reason there hasnt been that kind of criticism is that 
the taking of kuwait was so wrong going into that little country 
and gobbling it up said carol birkland head of the interchurch 
councils middle east committee 
ms birkland of chicago also secretary for the middle east of 
the evangelical lutheran church in america said the churches 
sometimes are accused of kneejerk antigovernment criticism 
of us foreign interventions 
but thats not true she said as the reaction this time 
demonstrates we look at each situation on a casebycase 
basis she added and in this instance weve been generally 
supportive of the us stance 
the situation is different she said she added that with 
the end of the eastwest cold war and humanitys immense relief at 
sovietamerican cooperation we thought we had moved beyond this 
kind of thing 
but there still is the old pattern we can only hope and pray 
there will be no further violence 
archbishop daniel e pilarczyk of cincinnati president of the 
national conference of catholic bishops said the iraqi invasion 
was devoid of provocation or any justification 
it poses a severe threat to international peace he said 
noting that the international community has responded through the 
use of multiple sanctions against iraq 
although not commenting on particular us tactics as was the 
case with the interchurch council the official catholic statement 
asked prayers for the members of the armed forces and their 
families 
it also urged prayers for continued international cooperation 
to protect both human rights and peace 
the american jewish committee commended president bush for the 
forceful leadership you have demonstrated in the crisis urged a 
firm and collective response to the naked act of aggression 
perpetrated by iraq and added 
american determination to resist saddam husseins bid for 
power sends a powerful signal to the world that ruthless tyrants 
cannot violate international law with impunity nor attempt too 
hold the worlds oil supply hostage to their will 
the rev emilio castro general secretary of the world council 
of churches said in a statement in geneva the council opposes 
strongly iraqs seizure of kuwait and supports the uns firm 
stand and action about it 
urging the arab league to go further in mediating the 
conflict castro said we call on all nations concerned to 
exercise patience and good will by refraining from use of force or 
show of force 
the rev j bryan hehir a roman catholic specialist on 
international affairs of georgetown university commended the un 
call for sanctions and said deployment of us and other troops 
could be regarded a means of preserving peace rather than 
aggravating hositlities 
you can argue that the movement of forces is designed to be a 
deterrent to further aggression he told catholic news service 
in that sense i think thats wise 
robert t hennemeyer director for justice and peace of the us 
catholic conference in washington said us church officials 
regard this as a clear case of aggression that thereby would meet 
the just war criteria 
by that criteria he noted a nation is justified in helping a 
friend attacked unjustly 
evangelist billy graham endorsing bushs call for prayer said 
the persian gulf situation is potentially one of the most 
dangerous threats to world peace and stability since world war ii 
upheavals there also could have major spiritual 
implications he said these events are happening in that part 
of the world where history began and the bible says where 
history as we know it will some day end 
let us pray that god will give wisdom to all those leaders 
whose decisions can make a difference there he said let us 
pray also that god will intervene and bring peace to that troubled 
region

the smallisbeautiful fraternity of

the grand champion burton ale was made by one of the six giant

michael jackson an englishman who calls himself the worlds 
bestknown beer writer declared that burton ale really is a very 
serious english bitter a classic example of an english bitter 
he rhapsodized about the beautiful balance of the sweetness of 
the malt and the flowery floral character the drier 
characteristics of the hop i think in the end the hop wins

definitely an exception in the eyes of the campaign for real 
ale the festival sponsor 
on the whole we dont think that the national brewers do a 
particularly good job said stephen cox spokesman for the 
organization 
that doesnt mean that we dont give praise where its due 
and burton ale is actually an example of a national brewer doing 
something that we think is right

in the color of sandy adobe it looks more like 
a school than a home it is in a way a school for life 
the rev joe carroll who grew up in a twobedroom bronx 
tenement with his parents and eight brothers and sisters thought 
he knew all there was to know about poverty when he built this home 
for the homeless less than five years ago 
but in the interim the goodhumored roman catholic priest with 
painfully arthritic knees says he has learned as much from the 
homeless as he has taught them about adjusting to society 
gone is his old notion that homelessness or other ills such as 
drug abuse can be wiped out 
homelessness is a problem that has been around forever he says 
problems cant always be solved but they can be managed 
so father joe as he is known in this slum neighborhood on the 
edge of downtown san diego is working in his pragmatic way not to 
eradicate homelessness just to manage it 
our society cant tolerate the idea that some americans live 
poor he says but were going to have to come to the realization 
that theres an element of every society at the bottom yet i keep 
hearing that homelessness and homeless kids are a recent 
phenomenon never had that in the united states before 
well how did father flanagans boys town get started he must 
have found runaway kids somewherewhat did charles dickens write 
about exactly what weve got today weve always had people living 
on the streets in the sewers the bridges kids taken advantage of 
by criminals using drugs what has changed since dickens time 
carroll used to believe like others that jobs were the answer 
that he says he no longer beieves some 60 percent cant work 
most because they are illiterate 
carrolls revised methods are built around what the homeless see 
as important and his knowledge of what unrelenting frustration can 
do to the human soul 
stage one is for the people who come in from the street its a 
crash pad for the night a flophouse a dormitory with a place to 
shower and get your laundry done a warm clean bed 
residents sign in every day for seven days for a bed then they 
sign up weekly for a bed once they pass 30 days the bed is theirs 
until they miss seven days in a row without telling the center 
carroll says there is no attempt to change behavior patterns 
but a bed unused is a bed denied someone else you go out on a 
binge and crash a couple of nights in the park but you know youre 
going to have a bed to come back to 
in stage one residents can earn their way to semiprivacy then 
privacy by being a good tenant they can move to doubleoccupancy 
cubicles in another large dormitory this entails additional 
responsibility keeping the place clean and doing laundry for 
newcomers it can all lead to a job and a room of ones own 
all the way through you can see the goals theyre within 
reach you can taste it you can see the other guys being more 
successful carroll says some guys may never ever move out 
of stage one some for whatever reason cant change their basic 
mentality but god bless them theyre still welcome 
about twice a year the street people get new clothes donated by 
big retailers 
adjacent to the shelter for street people is the st vincent de 
pauljoan kroc center for homeless families 
at the center residents are offered job training schooling in 
the english language assistance in getting welfare or veterans 
benefits legal services advice on housing beauty care and how 
best to use food coupons in the newspaper 
for many of the children it is the first time they have had an 
opportunity to go to school the first time they have seen a 
doctor three small rooms are a multigrade school at present but 
new quarters are under construction 
it has been something over a half dozen years since father joes 
bishop looking at the meager efforts to help the homeless told 
him to get things off the ground since then carroll now a 
monsignor has collected millions of dollars in donations what 
started as a thrift shop and soup and sandwiches at the back door 
has grown into a small village of hope 
the current wellequipped but tiny clinic soon will move into a 
10000squarefoot space in a new building there is one staff 
physician but 70 others who volunteer one staff surgeon backed up 
by 34 volunteers 
one of the medical volunteers bought 30000 worth of clinic 
equipment with his own money volunteer dentists are buying the 
equipment they need to operate in the new clinic 
a veterinarian comes in once a month to give shots and care for 
residents pets 
almost every part of the shelter serves double duty the dining 
room is a basketball court at night when there is an overload it 
is covered with cots whenever the temperature goes down to 40 
degrees the shelter is open all night on those nights regular 
capacity of 450 beds can be increased by an additional 350 
the kitchen also supplies the soup kitchen where carroll began 
his operation less than a mile away it prepares 2800 to 3000 
meals a day 
six days a week it is manned by volunteers from the catholic 
workers movement on sunday by volunteers from temple beth israel 
the alumni of the center are spreading through the city of san 
diego when carroll turned his car over to the valet for parking at 
symphony towers the valet was a graduate he said that without the 
centers help i couldnt have been able to turn my life around 
now he is sharing an apartment and going to college

its difficult to test a porsche 911 without feeling sentimental 
this is the car that retained its fluid roundnosed shape from 
the 1960s while the others in the auto world tinkered first with 
boxlike designs then aerodynamic forms 
this is the car that retained its big round headlights rear 
aircooled sixcylinder engine and little dashboard gauges while 
others added popup headlights digital speedometers and overhauled 
their engines 
this is a car that still turns heads and brings out the racer in 
people pull up to a stoplight and watch the driver in the next 
lane give you a glance and rev his mazda engine deep down he 
knows he wont beat the porsches 060 55second performance but 
he wants to try anyway 
the carrera 2 tiptronic that i drove included new features as 
well as the old revered ones there are now airbags for both the 
driver and front seat passenger antilock brakes are standard so 
is powerassist steering 
but perhaps the most intriguing new feature for 1990 was the 
dual function tiptronic transmission which offers urban drivers 
the option of automatic shifting or clutchless manual shifting 
the driver simply puts the gearshifter on either the automatic 
or manual side of the gearbox after shifting out of park or 
neutral in automatic the car behaves as if it has an 
automatic transmission it shifts itself 
on the manual side the car waits for the driver to move through 
the four gears just push the shifter forward at appropriate times 
and a red light on the dashboard will move from one number to the 
next to indicate what gear youre in the driver downshifts by 
pushing the gearshifter toward the back of the car theres no 
clutch 
ill admit this took some getting used to early on i kept 
putting my left foot down on the floor as if there was a clutch 
and i wasnt always picking the best times to shift 
but once i got the hang of it i found how fun this car could 
be in second gear my head snapped back into the headrest and the 
front of the car came up as i accelerated in manual i could 
manipulate the gears to get the maximum power and sweep up behind 
another car to pass with ease 
the 36liter sixcylinder engine was simply superb and at 247 
horsepower the most muscular ever in a 911 gas mileage might not 
be the greatest at 16 miles per gallon in the city but you 
dont get a 60000plus car like this and then count pennies at 
the fuel pump 
there is a back seat if you want to call it that but dont 
expect it to carry anything more than a briefcase and some clothes 
i was so scrunched sitting back there even sideways sitting 
alone i couldnt stretch out my legs and my head was nearly in my 
lap its best to plan on pulling the seat down and using the area 
for storage space 
and be sure to get used to riding low to the ground the porsche 
911 set me at eye level with the bottom half of the license plate 
on a misubishi montero in front of me while this can be somewhat 
unnerving in city traffic the low squat design of the 911 helps 
the car really hug the road and corner beautifully 
in the test car the spokes on the steering wheel sometimes 
blocked my view of those red lit numbers on the dashboard that 
indicated what gear i was in i also noticed considerable noise as 
the tires worked the roads and i had to keep pushing a button to 
get the rearwindow wiper to keep the back window clear in a 
downpour the wiper only takes a couple swipes then turns itself 
off 
but those mild complaints matter little to the 911s serious 
fans identified by company spokesman hal williams as independent 
entrepreneur types with average annual household income of 
140000 threequarters of purchasers are men average age 42 
the 1990 model year was the first for the tiptronic 
transmission and porsche planned to make just 650 of the 911 
carrera 2 tiptronics for the us market williams said that as the 
model year was winding down nearly all tiptronics already had 
buyers 
now the 1991s are beginning to arrive at porsches charleston 
sc port they are identical to the 1990s except that some new 
colors have been added and the base price has climbed 38 percent 
from 61280 for a 1990 model to 63650 for a 1991 the new colors 
include a vivid cobalt blue metallic and a superbright coral red

the vietnam war left cherie rankin a 
legacy of sadness denied and tears delayed 
as a 24yearold red cross worker confronted every day by death 
and suffering she was unable to cry when youre in a war she 
says you have to turn off the feelings in order to do the work 
for more than a decade after she came home in september 1971 
just thinking about vietnam produced headaches and shed become 
sick to her stomach at a reunion of red cross workers in 1984 she 
threw up until then she says she had no idea how vietnam had 
affected her 
now 20 years later she is making a sentimental journey back to 
help restore some of what the united states destroyed and to shed 
her tears 
ms rankin is part of a group of nine americans paying their own 
way over to help rebuild a medical clinic near hanoi destroyed by 
us bombers 
the team which is leaving in early september is the third to 
return to build badly needed medical facilities under the auspices 
of the veterans vietnam restoration project in garberville calif 
during september and october they will work with former vietnamese 
enemies who now are comrades in peace 
ms rankin now 44 will revisit the fields where the men she 
knew died and walk the grounds of the da nangarea orphanage where 
she fed clothed and played with the pitifully maimed children of 
war 
while i was there i never felt the sadness and i carry 
around some pain for those children she said being able to do 
the crying on the spot would be helpful being near firebases 
where many men who died i knew whose faces i see in my mind to do 
some crying for them 
she remembers flying in helicopters to the american firebases to 
boost the soldiers morale she is in field hospitals holding the 
hands of mortally wounded gis they clutch her tightly she is 
their last link to life 
the babyface of a young gi she met in da nang while he was 
awaiting his assignment is forever fixed in her mind he was so new 
his boots still were spitshined a few days later she saw him 
lying in a field hospital with tubes sticking out of him and the 
right side of his face blown away 
i went over to him and held his hand she said i reminded 
him i had seen him the other day and i think i said to him im 
sorry he flicked his eyes he couldnt talk but he gripped my 
hand 
within minutes he was dead that was my first death 
experience i marked that as the period of time where i numbed out 
when i saw that kid there i really wanted to run i wanted to go 
home i wanted my mother 
sometimes she still can hear the familiar whirring sounds of 
the helicopters and her mind drifts back she now feels the fear 
she repressed and she shakes at the thought of it 
dreams of vietnam invade her sleep if she doesnt remember 
them there always are the pillows across her body to remind her 
during the war red cross workers pulled mattresses over their 
bodies to protect themselves during rocket attacks 
i will wake up startled and all of my bed pillows are 
lined up the length of the bed she said even if i dont have 
a clear memory of the dream im acting as though i were 
experiencing it 
other images are of the children for whom she cared they are 
scorched by napalm blinded by bombs their arms and legs are 
missing 
among her poignant photos is one of an orphan an amerasian boy 
born to a vietnamese mother and american father he sits forlornly 
a fly rests on his face one of his legs is missing blown away by 
a mine 
he represents vietnam to me said ms rankin this is the 
child of the war and it says it all to me 
but there were rare moments of joy amid the poverty and pain a 
reminder is another photo this one of three grinning orphan boys 
throwing their arms around her one is blind one is missing part 
of his leg and one is retarded 
i love it ms rankin said just look at how happy i am to 
see those kids and how happy they are to see me how much physical 
touch is being shared 
ms rankin who originally is from west palm beach fla went 
to vietnam in september 1970 just out of florida state university 
in tallahassee she did not believe in the war but had faith in the 
men who were fighting like her younger brother doug a marine 
i went to visit my brother she said even though i had 
questions about the war i really undertstood why the guys were 
there and i wanted to do what i could to help them i also wanted 
the adventure and to find out why we were there see for myself 
despite her reservations and the sexism and sexual harassment 
she sometimes encountered she didnt question the us 
governments morality or motivation 
i was so red white and blue my blood was lavender ms 
rankin said i think we fell into two categories in their mind 
we were either virgins or whores their favorite girlfriend or 
sister or we were there to be propositioned 
i feel i was a pawn of our government coercing soldiers to 
fight red cross women were held up as home and apple pie this is 
what youre fighting for the way the military used red cross 
women was sexist we were there to be their decoration 
were flying out in helicopters in dresses 
when she returned home a year later the formerly gregarious 
woman withdrew into herself seeking solace in solitude for many 
years i would be afraid to be in crowds i did not like going to 
social events she said 
but that has improved through counseling at a veterans center 
ive had therapy off and on for 10 years she said i 
figure its the rest of my life not necessarily anymore because i 
have impairment for any level of functioning but its a matter of 
growth knowing yourself learning about yourself its an ongoing 
process

she first went into therapy for help with some marital and 
childhood issues 
i had no idea vietnam affected me until around six years 
ago she said 
she and her husband divorced in 1983 partly due to the war 
i closed the book on vietnam when i got back like everybody 
else did she said my husband had been a war protester and we 
never talked about vietnam he was not comfortable talking about 
it neither was anybody else in the country 
at the vietnam reunion in new york city six years ago the 
whole thing started opening up everything started coming to the 
surface she said just after she arrived she got a throbbing 
headache that lasted for a day and a half until she threw up 
i felt better after i did that she said its taken me a 
long time i would have physical responses to thinking about 
vietnam or talking about vietnam that would last sometimes for a 
couple of weeks now i have a little bit of an emotional response 
after i talk about vietnam 
ms rankin herself is a psychotherapist while in vietnam she 
will do some construction work but she also will serve as the team 
shrink coleading a discussion group 
she is one of hundreds of veterans returning in recent years to 
try to sort out the real war as well as the war in their minds 
it profoundly affected your life whether youre conscious of 
it or not she said i think many of us who make that 
pilgrimage back become conscious that it affected our lives and 
theres something we havent resolved or havent put to rest i 
think people go back to do that

no sooner did donald trump win some 
time to restructure his troubled financial empire than the clock 
began ticking for his next showdown with gambling regulators in 
october 
the casino control commission voted 50 to approve a bailout 
plan that pledges trumps three casinos as collateral for a 65 
million loan he received to make a bond payment on the trump castle 
hotel and casino 
but the commission decided to call trump in early for 
relicensing hearings on all three of his casinos because of 
questions surrounding his finances trump wasnt scheduled for the 
hearings until the spring but the commission wants to see him in 
october 
we must hold a financial stability hearing as soon as 
possible said acting commission chairwoman valerie armstrong 
the casino control act requires all casino enterprises to 
maintain financial stability integrity and responsibility 
we have approved the pledges without inquiring into whether 
the three trump properties continue to meet these standards and it 
is surely our obligation to conduct that inquiry as quickly as we 
can ms armstrong said 
the october hearing comes one month before trump must make a 47 
million bond payment due nov 15 on the trump taj mahal casino 
resort the state division of gaming enforcement which reluctantly 
endorsed trumps bailout said the developer will not make that 
payment under present conditions 
november is just around the corner and thats the immediate 
problem we face said thomas auriemma a deputy attorney general 
with the division if the money had not been advanced the whole 
trump organization would have faced in our opinion total 
collapse 
trumps attorneys also argued that his empire could have 
crumbled without the commissions approval 
ms armstrong said the commission shared the divisions lack of 
enthusiasm for the plan but would approve it as the best immediate 
hope for the solvency of trumps three casinos 
this is obviously a situation in which there are no good 
answers for mr trump or new jersey she said whether we 
approve or disapprove this restructuring our action will be 
fundamentally unsettling the risk of substantial economic 
disruption at the casinos will be less with the restructuring than 
it is without it 
trump wearing a blue tie blue suit and bluestriped shirt 
whispered occasionally during the 30minute hearing to his top 
executives but otherwise stared straight ahead unsmiling and with 
his lips pursed 
he repeatedly told a throng of reporters and camera crews 
afterward that the ruling left him happy he also restated his 
belief that his plight was not unusual because he feels the country 
is in a recession once the economy improves his assets will 
rebound he said 
this is a big hurdle and im happy trump told reporters 
maybe you can focus on someone else now 
trump said the first task of the financial restructuring would 
be to focus on the taj mahal 
since its opening april 2 the taj has either fallen short or 
just reached the 13 million a day in gross gaming revenues that 
analysts say it needs to break even 
the taj mahal lost 144 million on gross revenue of 126 
million in its first three months ended june 30 according to 
figures released last week by the casino association of new jersey 
trump plaza hotel and casino had a profit of 876000 on gross 
revenues of 834 million while trump castle lost 81 million on 
gross revenues of 634 million 
in approving the bailout package the casino commission cited 
the benefits of an immediate infusion of 65 million deferred 
interest payments on outstanding loans and a requirement that 
banks holding at least twothirds of the loan find trump in default 
before action can be taken against him 
the approval also came with several reservations about the trump 
organization which has compiled more than 32 billion in debt on 
trumps casinos manhattan real estate trump shuttle airline and 
yacht the casinos bear responsibility for roughly 13 billion in 
debt 
ms armstrong said the agreement contains destabilizing features 
for the casinos including a link between the three properties that 
could prompt foreclosure at two trump gaming halls if financial 
problems arose at a third 
even more disturbing is the link the restructuring forges 
between the fate of the casinos and that of other trump assets 
ms armstrong said using a possible bankruptcy at the trump 
shuttle as one possible example 
trump faces 5405 million in overdue debts 2405 million of 
which he has personally guaranteed ms armstrong said he will 
face an additional 1695 million in debt by the end of april 
commissioners and the division both said trumps problems stand 
out as clear reasons why other casinos should avoid assuming huge 
amounts of debt

companies are jamming government phone lines to find out what 
benefits they are obligated to provide employees who may be called 
to active duty as military reservists 
small business operators said tuesday they would have the most 
difficult time filling the gaps created by absent reservists called 
to support operations in the persian gulf 
it can be hurtful its all ive been thinking about said 
ted thomas a dentist in solo practice in clinton nc i have no 
one to cover for me and my patients would have to go elsewhere for 
treatment it would almost be like starting over once i return 
thomas and others like him may request exemptions if called but 
they would have to prove severe hardship and even then there 
are no guarantees military experts said 
for big business the impact is softened by bigger numbers 
we probably have 9600 employees total probably 40 to 50 are 
involved in the reserves so that small a ratio in essence wouldnt 
have that big of an impact said disney reece director of human 
resources for memorex telex corps storage systems group in tulsa 
okla 
medical personnel as well as people with expertise in 
communications and electronics are likely to be in highest demand 
at the department of veterans affairs medical center in 
northport ny on long island hospital officials are making 
plans to replace anyone called to duty administrative assistant 
marlin schuh speculated the impact will be minimal unless they 
took some of the critical specialists like a skilled surgeon 
though federal laws were put in place in the 1940s to protect 
reservists from losing their jobs confusion abounds the number of 
businesses seeking information on the law has tripled in the past 
few days compared with normal august activity said maj austin 
smith at the defense departments national committee for employer 
support of the guard and reserves 
the committee is scrambling to get guidelines out in overnight 
mail to district offices that can work with businesses on a local 
basis 
the vast majority of employers are perfectly willing to adhere 
to the law but an awful lot of them dont understand what the 
provisions are because it is used so seldomly said john tieso of 
the labor departments division of veterans reemployment rights 
under the law reservists called out of the civilian work force 
must be treated like any worker on an unpaid leave of absence when 
they return businesses large and small must give them their old 
jobs back or ones of equal stature with full seniority 
in addition reservists are due any increase in pay or benefits 
that other workers received while they were gone but the law also 
gives employers the right to lay off a reservist if it can show the 
job was eliminated while he or she was away at duty 
though employers arent required to provide medical benefits 
many allow reservists to continue coverage if they pay their own 
premiums 
theres a good possibility that corporate coverage is better 
than government coverage said one officer who asked not to be 
identified 
reservists who serve more than 30 days are covered by the 
militarys medical plan a potential problem arises tieso said 
for those who serve under one month 
many businesses that have called the labor and defense 
departments to check on the law have indicated theyll continue 
medical benefits for reservists during the initial 30day period 
in a relatively unknown situation where they dont know how 
long its going to be it could be five days 15 days or 150 days 
some employers are simply saying hey dont worry about it 
well take care of it until you get home tieso said 
so far employers arent balking over the law tieso said most 
of them want to make it easier for these guys to go off to service 
its a nice way to do business he said

a synthetic hormone that can boost milk 
production in dairy cows by 10 percent to 25 percent has cleared 
all the safety testing it needs and merits approval for commercial 
use doctors say in a medical journal 
the hormone bovine somatotropin or bst has been banned 
temporarily in two states but the doctors wrote in wednesdays 
journal of the american medical association that it causes no 
changes in milk composition of any practical importance to 
consumers 
the minor differences in milk composition shown between 
unsupplemented and bstsupplemented cows are well within normal 
biological variation in milk composition they wrote 
the authors dr william h daughaday of washington university 
school of medicine in st louis and david m barbano of the food 
science department at cornell university in ithaca ny each have 
done consulting or research work under grants from one of its four 
manufacturers monsanto co the journal said 
however an editorial by an outside researcher concurred with 
their conclusions saying milk produced from cows treated with 
bovine somatotropin is no different from the milk of untreated 
cows 
it is both inappropriate and wrong for specialinterest groups 
to play on the health and safety fears of the public to further 
their own ends said the editorial by charles h grossman an 
immunologist at the department of veterans affairs in cincinnati 
daughaday and barbano noted that the food and drug 
administration pronounced the hormone safe in 1985 and could 
approve its commercial use by next year a possibility that has 
raised concerns among groups opposed to genetic engineering 
the hormone is produced by a method similar to that used to make 
synthetic human insulin 
critics say not enough research has been done to be sure milk 
produced by cows injected with the animal hormone would be safe for 
people 
grossman said hysterical reaction produced laws in wisconsin 
and minnesota temporarily barring the use of bst for at least a 
year 
however in january the chairman of the senate agriculture 
committee sen patrick leahy dvt called for an investigation 
of the fdas review of the hormone after allegations that the 
review had been inadequate

a federal judge supervising an overhaul of the 
manville trust fund for the first time limited fees to plaintiffs 
lawyers for settling claims involving asbestosrelated diseases 
us district judge jack b weinstein who has ordered an 
overhaul of the cashstrapped trust tuesday limited the amount 
lawyers can charge clients to 20 percent of settlements in 
emergency cases 
weinstein last month froze all payments by the trust pending a 
reorganization plan except to victims who can demonstrate financial 
or medical hardship the freeze is in place until sept 6 when a 
financial restructuring plan is due 
an estimated one third of more than 1 billion paid to asbestos 
victims since the trust was established in 1988 has gone to 
attorneys handling the cases limits on payment arrangements 
between attorneys and their clients was not ordered when the trust 
was formed as part of manville corps bankruptcy reorganization 
weinstein has been highly critical of the amount received by 
lawyers and had promised to reduce the payments so victims could 
receive more money in the future 
the matter of fees is now being considered in connection with 
a restructuring of the trusts payment program weinstein wrote 
in his order ongoing discussions with representative plaintiffs 
lawyers are continuing 
the fee cap applies only to hardship claim settlements under 
which claimants must prove extreme financial need based on number 
of dependents disease prognosis prior settlements assets and 
liabilities and other income 
under weinsteins ruling for settlements paid out over time 
the 20 percent fee limit may be collected only as each payment is 
received so that victims or their families always receive 80 
percent of each check 
attorneys were expected to challenge the cap many plaintiffs 
lawyers have argued they have earned the amount charged by virtue 
of more than a decade of work by some attorneys in the asbestos 
litigation 
the judge had made it clear that he anticipated some type of 
reduction though i think the reduction is more than is justified 
given the amount fo work that goes into these cases said stanley 
levy a leading asbestos plaintiffs lawyer 
it also raises the question of whether he really has the 
authority to interfere in the contractual relationship between a 
client and the attorney levy said 
us bankruptcy judge burton lifland who presided over the 
manville reorganization refused to impose a limit on attorneys 
fees no other judge has sought such a limit before 
the trust to date has settled close to 24000 claims for more 
than 1 billion from people with lung cancer and other respiratory 
diseases caused by inhaling asbestos fibers mostly during 
shipbuilding and other construction 
but the trust faces 130000 more claims it cant meet and has 
paid only two thirds of the money it owes in settled cases the 
reorganization order came after the trust said it was out of money 
to pay new claims it said would not be met until well into the 21st 
century 
the trust also is under fire for a decision to hire a public 
relations firm on a 10000 monthly retainer with a 15000 monthly 
cap the trust has paid the firm robinson lake lerer and 
montgomery about 30000 so far 
it is unclear whether the payments violate weinsteins freeze on 
payments but the judge has been notified about the public 
relations firms hiring one of his law clerks said tuesday 
the trust eventually is expected to be consolidated with a group 
of asbestosmaking companies that say they cant meet asbestos 
claims into a single classaction lawsuit before weinstein

if you wondered why oil is worth fighting for 
take a look at fortune magazines latest ranking of the worlds 
billionaires 
the two richest people on the face of the earth are oil barons 
the magazine reported tuesday 
sultan haji hassanal bolkiah oilrich leader of the tiny 
pacific sultanate of brunei retained fortunes top title for the 
fourth straight year with an estimated worth of 25 billion 
unchanged from 1989 
saudi arabias king fahd and clan a focus of the persian gulf 
crisis ranked second with assets worth 18 billion also unchanged 
from last year 
fortune spokeswoman emma dockendorff said those estimates were 
based partly on oil prices in midjuly when one barrel of crude 
fetched about 18 
prices have since surged to about 28 a barrel following iraqs 
aug 2 invasion of kuwait and the us move to protect neighboring 
saudi arabia that price jump would make the sultan and the king 
potentially even wealthier 
the ranks of fortunes richest bankrolled by assets ranging 
from oil to sneakers to ball bearings swelled by 25 names this 
year to 182 individuals and families controlling a combined empire 
worth 4713 billion 
thats up about 7 percent from last year and enough to erase the 
us budget deficit trade deficit and a good chunk of the savings 
amp loan bailout tab 
fortune released the fourth annual ranking in its sept 10 
issue it said the average entrants wealth was only slightly 
higher compared with last year after adjusting for inflation 
but the average fortune was still worth about 26 billion 
which if invested in 75 percent us treasury bills would earn 
534000 a day 
true you shouldnt feel too sorry for folks who have their 
own islands and castles use reniors for wallpaper and control in 
the aggregate 4713 billion fortune said 
as competitor forbes magazine did in its annual list released 
last month fortune ditched the sultan of new york donald j 
trump whose real estate and casino empire is bogged down in debt 
the magazine had estimated his holdings at 17 billion last year 
fortune placed trump in a separate category of fallen tycoons 
who also included troubled takeover strategist james goldsmith and 
convicted financier michael milken 
ranked third on fortunes list was the reclusive mars family of 
the united states whose holdings include mars inc candy bars 
uncle bens rice and kalkan pet food worth 125 billion 
fourth was britains queen elizabeth ii the wealthiest woman 
with an untaxed personal fortune of 117 billion in riches ranging 
from 267000 acres of royal real estate to racehorses crown jewels 
and a vast stock portfolio 
fifth was the newhouse family of the united states owners of a 
large media empire worth 115 billion sixth was the reichmann 
family of canada with extensive real estate holdings valued at 
111 billion tied for seventh were yoshiaki tsutsumi japans 
richest industrialist and arkansas retailing mogul sam walton 
both valued at 73 billion eighth was john w kluge of the united 
states owner of media giant metromedia inc valued at 70 
billion ninth was tsai wanlin and family of taiwan owners of a 
construction and insurance empire worth 65 billion 10th was the 
thomson family owners of canadas biggest newspaper chain at 62 
billion 
american newcomers included the stephens family of arkansas 
owners of investment banking energy and real estate holdings worth 
17 billion the parfet family of kalamazoo mich owners of a 
large stake in the upjohn co drugmaker worth 15 billion and 
philip knight head of the nike inc athletic footwear maker 13 
billion 
foreign newcomers included alicia and esther koplovitz of spain 
owners of a 22 billion construction and banking fortune hiroshi 
termachi owner of a 18 billion japanese ball bearing business 
and john spyros latsis european head of a saudi arabian shipping 
and oilrefinery network worth 18 billion 
the magazine based estimates of net worth on what it called 
published information or appraisals of asset values to 
qualify each prospect needed a net worth of 1 billion or more 
after subtracting debt 
fortune said the united states remained home to the greatest 
number of billionaires at 58 twenty were from the persian gulf 15 
from west germany nine from italy and eight in japan down from 
12 last year

italian financier giancarlo parretti 
has paid another 50 million towards pathe communications corps 
13 billion purchase of mgmua communications co 
tuesdays payment brings to 303 million the total of 
nonrefundable down payments that parretti has made since march 
when pathe began making monthly installments of roughly 50 million 
another 50 million deposit is due sept 20 and the agreement 
calls for parretti chief of pathe to come up with the nearly 950 
million balance by oct 23 
the company is confident it will complete the deal as 
planned said pathe spokesman craig parsons 
parretti and kirk kerkorian who controls mgmua agreed to the 
monthly installments after pathe failed to come to terms with its 
major backer time warner inc 
for the fourmonth extension granted pathe mgmua stockholders 
will get 2150 a share from the deal up from the original 20 a 
share 
time warner had agreed to provide a 650 million loan to pathe 
for the deal in return for a lien on the valuable united artists 
film library and extensive distribution rights to pathe and ua 
movies 
but that part of the deal fell apart and time warner has sued 
pathe for 100 million accusing pathe of breaching its contract 
by among other things doubleselling some distribution rights 
the media conglomerate said pathe apparently never was able to 
meet one of the terms of the deal that it come up with the other 
half up with the 13 billion in money that was not borrowed 
pathe countersued for 500 million saying time warner had 
breached its contractual duty to provide the 650 million loan

putting the privatelyheld media company up for sale and plan to 
use the proceeds for preserving the environment 
there are some real environmental crises right now that we 
have the opportunity to meet harriet stimson bullitt said 
if we have a chance to contribute to the salmon coming back to 
a clean river or to see the sparkle of the water and smell the 
freshness of the air and the earth of the forests and to see the 
forests continue to grow that would be the most exciting 
prospect for us she said 
bullitt chairwoman of the executive committee of king and 
priscilla collins chairwoman of the board said they expected more 
than 500 million from the sale 
they said they wanted to put more money into their bullitt 
foundations environmental efforts and wanted to find a 
satisfactory buyer before either of their deaths forced a sale

1200 employees 
the company could be worth as much as 650 million said media 
analyst bishop cheen of paul kagan associates in carmel calif 
he said the company may have to be sold in pieces since credit

three years ago stephen f bollenbach saved 
hotelgaming giant holiday corp from a hostile takeover attempt by 
developer donald j trump now hes trying to save trump from 
himself 
trump recently picked bollenbach as chief financial officer for 
his debtswamped gambling and real estate holdings to satisfy a key 
creditor demand 
banks had agreed to loan trump 65 million this summer on the 
condition he appoint a financial officer by sept 30 among other 
things the loan was needed to help make a payment on junk bonds 
used to finance trumps three atlantic city nj casinos which 
were put up as collateral for the loan 
bollenbach who joined the trump organization several days ago 
after being cfo for holiday spinoff promus cos of memphis tenn 
will serve as a liaison between trump and the banks he says hes 
confident he can help his old adversary escape the clutches of 
borrowed money 
weve got some really terrific assets like this hotel the 
47yearold bollenbach said during an interview at trumps posh 
plaza hotel bollenbachs home in new york but they draw their 
business from the northeast an area thats in an economic 
downturn 
bollenbach said trump will have to overcome a dwindling pool of 
financing sources thanks to the collapse of the highyield 
highrisk junk bond market and stricter lending policies among 
commericial banks 
its put him in a bind he said in a recent interview we 
need to finance our way through the slow times the solution is to 
make sure we keep costs down 
but easing the flamboyant developers 33 billion total debt 
burden will take some time bollenbach conceded 
bollenbach has begun by turning his attention to atlantic city 
which like the real estate industry remains in a slump he said 
hes looking for cheaper ways to attract casino customers and 
increase gambling revenues 
this is their customers selected form of entertainment but 
like all selected forms of entertainment youve got to make sure 
you dont spend more on getting your customers there than its 
worth he said 
the new jersey casino association said atlantic citys 12 
casinos recorded their first losing second quarter since gambling 
began there in 1978 trumps recently opened taj mahal alone lost 
141 million 
bollenbach the son of a southern california milkman is a 
personable family man with saltandpepper hair and a closecropped 
beard he and his wife barbara share homes in memphis and 
greenwich conn 
he said he hadnt meet trump until this summer but the two have 
known of each other for years 
bollenbach is credited with fending off trumps takeover attempt 
of holiday corp in 1987 a year after bollenbach joined the firm 
the company which owned harrahs casinos and smaller hotel 
groups in addition to holiday inns had been considered 
undervalued that prompted some shareholders including trump to 
increase their stakes in holiday 
bollenbach was behind a 24 billion recapitalization plan that 
ultimately raised holidays debt and made the company less 
attractive as a takeover target 
we borrowed 28 billion paid a 65 dividend to shareholders 
and over the next couple of years we sold real estate he 
explained 
the plan kept trump away but it also made him between 18 
million to 30 million richer bollenbach noted 
holiday was sold to british brewing giant bass plc last spring 
promus was spun off after the sale 
bollenbachs business career took off in 1968 when he went to 
work for daniel k ludwig a phoenix ariz shipping magnate and 
industrialist who also owned a chain of savings and loans he 
worked his way up through ludwigs company and was its chief 
financial officer when he was hired by marriott corp in 1981 
bollenbach said marriotts thenchairman gary wilson broadened 
the role of cfo to make it more involved in the total business 
although there was a certain comfort in working at promus a 
great job with people i like to work with bollenbach says hes 
ready for his next challenge one that is likely to raise his 
public profile 
i keep thinking of what andy warhol said about everybody being 
famous for 15 minutes he said id settle for four or five 
maybe even two

although more than half of the 195000 dalkon 
shield claimants have been paid more than 23 billion is still 
available to women who were injured by the birth control device a 
trust fund official said wednesday 
the fund contained 25 billion when it was established last 
year but a significant portion still remains because of the size 
of payments thus far and the fact the fund is drawing 500000 per 
day in interest said julie freeman the funds manager of claimant 
relations 
ms freeman said the trust fund would shrink more rapidly as 
more large claims are paid 
the dalkon shield intrauterine device manufactured by the 
richmondbased ah robins co in the 1970s was used by nearly 4 
million women around the world said linda hightower of atlanta 
director of the dalkon shield victims association 
lawsuits filed by women who claimed to be injured by the device 
forced robins to file for bankruptcy reorganization in 1985 women 
who used the product reported a variety of injuries including 
sterility miscarriages and pelvic inflammatory disease 
robins later was acquired by the american home products 
pharmaceutical company 
ms freeman said most of the claims paid so far were filed under 
an option that limits payments to 725 under that option 
claimants do not have to document their injuries 
a second option allows claims of up to 5500 while a third 
provides for substantially higher payments ms freeman said 
she said the fund was not releasing a figure on how high those 
claims could reach 
ms hightower said the largest settlement she has heard about 
was 195000 
the trust wont say how many option 3 claims theyve paid 
she said they say theyre three months ahead of schedule i 
dont know what their schedule was but it must have been real 
slow 
ms freeman said she is satisfied with the progress in settling 
the claims she said about 81000 claimants still must decide which 
of the three options to pursue before payments can be made women 
have until next july 1 to make a decision payments are pending for 
about 15000 claimants who have chosen an option 
women who have not yet filed a claim still may do so ms 
freeman said however late claims will be the last ones 
considered she said 
ralph pittle a seattle lawyer whose firm represents more than 
900 claimants said his company continues to receive calls from 
women who were injured by the device but did not know they could 
file a claim 
granted there was an extensive advertising campaign but not 
everyone watches tv listens to radio or reads newspapers he 
said some people just have a hard time surviving

grain and soybean futures prices closed higher 
wednesday on the chicago board of trade 
trading was mixed and sluggish through much of the session but 
prices firmed on the belief that the soviet union is in the market 
for cooking oil 
rumors surfaced late the day that the russians were buying or 
interested in buying bottled vegetable oil from south america 
said victor lespinasse an assistant vice president with dean 
witter reynolds inc 
he said this report was enough to lift prices higher in most 
trading pits 
at the close wheat was 2 cents to 3 cents higher with the 
contract for delivery in september at 282 a bushel corn was 1 
cents lower to 1 cents higher with september at 253 a bushel

kuwait oil tanker co hopes to charter 
some of its 30 oil and products tankers that have been idled by the 
iraqi invasion of kuwait oil industry sources said wednesday 
the tanker company an affiliate of the staterun kuwait 
petroleum corp wants to offset the losses its incurred because 
of the aug 2 invasion 
oil industry sources said one chartering deal is already under 
discussion and could be completed next month the tankers have been 
on charter to kuwait petroleum and would now be subchartered said 
the sources who spoke on condition they not be named 
none of kuwaits fleet of oil and products tankers was caught in 
the country at the time of the invasion some are still delivering 
crude oil loaded before the invasion to the kuwait petroleum 
international network in europe 
the 30 tankers have a total of 256 million tons capacity but 
the cutoff of kuwaiti oil installations and refineries leaves 
kuwait petroleum with substantial excess tanker capacity industry 
sources said 
with the oil installations and refineries in kuwait cut off by 
the iraqi occupation kpc is concentrating on the refining and 
marketing operations in europe which are run by kuwait petroleum

the washington post co on wednesday said it 
has joined with american personal communications inc to develop a 
new pocketsized wireless telephone service for the washington 
area 
marylandbased amc is the general partner in the limited 
partnership which expects to begin testing an experimental phone 
system by the end of the year and be fully operational by the end 
of 1991 the companies said 
initially the system would allow only oneway outbound calling 
in washington and its maryland and virginia suburbs much like pay 
phones such service already is in use in great britain 
the companies could jointly invest up to 6 million in the 
testing phase post spokesman guyon knight said he would not 
speculate on what the overall development cost would be 
the system is one of a number of federal communications 
commissionsanctioned experiments in personal communications 
networks that proponents hope eventually will replace existing 
cellular and wired phone systems particularly in office buildings 
these proponents envision that someday all calls will be made 
not to locations but to people wherever they are who would carry 
tiny phones with them 
wayne n schelle amcs chairman said these new types of 
wireless phones are expected to be smaller lighter and less 
expensive than todays portable cellular phones 
every member of a family or employee of a business will be 
able to carry a phone in their pocket in the same way they 
currently carry their keys or wallet schelle said in a statement 
the folding phones which will resemble a travel alarm clock 
may be sold for as little as 75 amc says 
customers would be able to make calls whenever they are in range 
of refrigeratorsized transmitting stations that would link callers 
with the public phone network or to other users of the wireless 
system 
the system will use digital spread spectrum technology that 
allows a single call to switch back and forth continually to 
whatever frequency is available the lowpower radio signals will 
have ranges of only a few hundred feet which means they will have 
less tendency to interfere with each other 
this approach should dramatically increase the capacity and 
thus lower the costs for a personal communications network 
compared with todays cellular systems which use more power to 
operate over longer distances on a relatively restricted number of 
channels however the lowpower devices do not work well in moving 
automobiles 
amc received permission from the fcc earlier this year to test 
the new phone service for up to 2000 users but the fcc is still 
deciding whether to allot precious radio airspace to these new 
types of services 
the companies said that if the fcc approves full development of 
the new service it will consider expanding to other us cities 
the washington post co whose holdings include the washington 
post newspaper in 1983 won a cellular phone franchise with amc for 
the washingtonbaltimore area the post no longer is in that 
partnership knight said

the federal governments sale of oil and gas 
leases in the gulf of mexico on wednesday drew few participants 
but officials said the low turnout had nothing to do with iraqs 
invasion of kuwait 
many people might expect the middle east to affect the sale 
but oftentimes big oil companies have already developed their 
bidding strategy said ed cassidy deputy director of the 
minerals management service of the department of interior 
one of the oil company representatives who asked that his name 
not be used said most companies had already budgeted this years 
exploration before the iraqkuwait invasion which has pushed crude 
prices up 70 percent and made exploration for untapped reserves 
much more attractive 
shell offshore inc offered the high bid of the day 637 
million for a tract off cameron la 
wednesdays high bids totaled 1624 million in all 70 
companies put up 2409 million for the 4792 tracts offered each 
tract is about 5000 acres and most lie off the texas coast 
cassidy said the area has traditionally yielded more natural gas 
than oil 
thats another reason why the middle east crisis is not 
directly affecting this sale he said 
officials said the area held potential reserves of 100 million 
barrels of oil and 148 trillion cubic feet of gas 
todays sale is a bit smaller that we expected but theres no 
direct correlation to the middle east situation said charlie 
howell a mobil representative its just a matter of generating 
the prospects

the boeing co has taken its insurance companies 
to court in a bid to settle an 80 million dispute over who should 
pay to clean up toxic wastes at two seattlearea sites 
the insurance companies have refused to pay for cleanup closts 
they contend boeing knew it was polluting western processing in 
kent and queen city farms in maple valley 
but during opening statements in court tuesday boeing attorneys 
told a us district court jury that the aircraft manufacturer 
never expected its practices would cause widespread pollution at 
the sites 
boeing believes its insurance policies should have been 
honored and they have not been said robert sayler an attorney 
for the company 
boeing has told its insurers it could be liable for cleanup 
costs at 13 sites in six states which could run into hundreds of 
millions of dollars 
boeing dumped 24 million gallons of liquid wastes into pits at 
western processing and queen city farms 
in the 1980s the company agreed to pay the bulk of the cleanup 
costs more than 80 million at the sites under courtordered 
consent decrees with the federal environmental protection agency 
sayler said boeing began using queen city farms in 1957 because 
it preferred a remote lagoon over dumping its wastes in the 
duwamish river or puget sound boeing had been barging its wastes 
to sea for dumping before 1957 said charles gordon another 
company attorney 
in 1964 gordon said boeing began taking its wastes to western 
processing because that company was recycling the state also 
recommended the move 
boeing never anticipated the problems that would occur at the 
sites and the companys decisions must be viewed in the context of 
environmental standards that have evolved over the years sayler 
and gordon told the jury 
the insurance companies named as defendants include aetna 
casualty amp surety co hartford accident amp indemnity co insurance 
co of north american and ronald e smith amp cos an association of 
syndicates that includes lloyds of london

stephen a schwartz president of the 
playskool division of toymaker hasbro inc has stepped down in a 
management shakeup that would have moved him down the corporate 
chain of command 
hasbros announcement tuesday said schwartz 41 resigned to 
pursue other business opportunities 
under schwartz playskool was hasbros fastestgrowing division 
during the past two years taking on the fisherprice unit of 
quaker oats co 
playskool whose products include mr potato head and 
tinkertoys generated about 352 million in domestic sales last 
year or about 25 percent of hasbros 14 billion in worldwide net 
sales 
under the new arrangement schwartz would have reported to 
alfred j verrecchia who has been made chief operating officer for 
hasbros domestic toy operations schwartz had been reporting 
directly to alan g hassenfeld hasbro chairman and chief executive 
paul h valentine toy industry analyst at standard amp poors 
corp said schwartz who joined hasbro in 1978 was one of the 
guiding lights of hasbro through the 1980s when the company grew 
rapidly 
but recently hasbros sales have lagged and verrecchia may have 
been appointed to oversee domestic toy operations because he has 
more of a financial background analysts suggested 
hassenfeld did not comment in the statement about schwartzs 
departure and was not available for comment the management 
restructuring cuts in half the number of people reporting to the 
chairman and will allow hassenfeld to concentrate on strategic 
plans for the company verrecchia said

crude oil futures soared above 30 a barrel for 
the first time in nearly five years wednesday as traders reacted 
to fears of military escalation in the middle east showdown 
nervous trading also pushed unleaded gasoline futures to a 
record high closing price 
analysts said world supplies were starting to feel the crunch of 
4 million barrels of crude lost each day through the boycott of 
iraq and kuwait the saudi arabians also curtailed some previously 
arranged sales of jet fuel and other products to accommodate the 
massive military buildup on their soil 
the main factor here in the crude market apart from a concern 
of hostilities is simply the fact that opec continues to drag its 
feet in getting higher production said bob baker an analyst 
with prudentialbache securities inc 
indications that saudi arabia and venezuela want to increase 
production have not materialized into any more oil 
the price of october contracts for light sweet crude shot up 
251 per 42gallon barrel to close at 3122 on the new york 
mercantile exchange oil last traded above the 30 threshold on 
nov 26 1985 
unleaded gasoline prices on the merc closed at 1043 per gallon 
for september delivery up 299 cents over tuesdays record close 
of 1013 per gallon the nearterm contract has closed higher for 
six straight trading days 
those following the industry said consumers will be paying even 
more for gasoline at the pump although analysts said there was no 
firm way to translate the rise in futures prices to a predictable 
rise in retail prices 
one analyst said a 1cent rise in unleaded futures can mean a 
1cent increase at the pump 
wall street traders were generally surprised by the abrupt jump 
of crude over the 30 per barrel mark 
as long as this standoff continued i had expected pretty 
volatile markets in the 25 to 30 range said stephen smith an 
oil analyst with bear stearns amp co 
annlouise hittle a senior oil analyst with shearson lehman 
brothers inc said markets shot up partially in reaction to news 
that saudi arabia was cancelling some of its sales contracts in a 
move to supply oil products to the international military forces 
that have converged on the persian gulf 
the concrete news that came into the market this morning was 
the cutback in saudi arabias product export availability hittle 
said first we lost kuwait 690000 barrels a day now the far 
east and some us majors have lost volume from the saudis on top 
of that there is also a lot of concern that this situation could 
get worse 
traders had no firm numbers for the size of the saudi cutbacks 
hittle said 
while markets were still open wednesday afternoon president 
bush announced he was ordering military reservists to active duty 
in the persian gulf telling a news conference that the united 
states will not retreat from the hard line it has taken against 
iraqi leader saddam hussein 
the conference was not reassuring to the market hittle said 
what the market is looking for at this point is a clear sign 
that there will not be any military escalation its still nervous 
everybody is still buying if theres a change in the political or 
military situation then well see a change for sure but i cant 
predict that 
inventories of oil available to the world market have declined 
by about 80 million barrels from the 250 million barrel range 
since iraq invaded kuwait on aug 2 smith said 
the saudis and the venezuelans and the united arab emirates 
have been talking about increased production to offset the missing 
oil but so far its been mostly talk smith said 
in other products traded on the merc home heating oil rose 764 
cents per gallon to 9135 cents for september delivery while 
natural gas moved up from 1420 to 1428 per 1000 cubic feet

here are selected excerpts from the 
new jersey casino control commissions ruling tuesday allowing 
donald trump to use his three casinos as collateral for a 65 
million loan 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
there are two essential restructuring documents the credit 
agreement and the override agreement 
under the credit agreement seven banks will grant a 65 million 
line of credit to trump the initial draw will be 40 million 20 
million of which will replace 20 million previously loaned to meet 
an interest payment on the trump castle bonds the remainder is to 
be used in accordance with a business plan 
interest on borrowings under the credit agreement will be 
payable currently principal repayment will be deferred until the 
agreement expires the agreement is for three years extendable to 
five years at trumps option if he satisfies various conditions 
including supplying a new business plan acceptable to the seven 
banks covering the additional two years 
the override agreement is between trump and the nine banks which 
hold the 1 billion in restructuring debt 840 million of which 
hold the 1 billion in restructuring debt 840 million of which 
affords potential recourse for trump because it is guaranteed by 
him or is debt of a partnership in which he is a general partner

agreement the principal and in most cases the interest on the 1 
billion will be deferred for five years in addition the banks

as long as there is any outstanding loan under the credit 
agreement the seven signatory banks may declare a default by a 
vote of the holders of twothirds of the outstanding amount of the 
loan upon the occurrence of an event of default 
events of default include 
a payment default under the credit agreement 
the breach of any term of the credit agreement 
the failure to keep any loan document in full force and effect 
a payment default on any indebtedness of trump or his 
affiliates other than the trump shuttle of over 5 million 
a bankruptcy or other judicial declaration of insolvency by 
trump or any of his affiliates 
the failure of trump or any of his affiliates to make payments 
to certain employee benefit plans 
any judgment of over 5 million against trump or his 
affiliates other than the trump shuttle which remains unpaid for 
80 days 
any material adverse change in the condition financial or 
otherwise of trump or his affiliates 
any governmental action which materially and adversely affects 
the ability of trump and his affiliates to operate the casinos 
any restructuring of the equity of any casino company 
trumps death or incapacity 
if a default is declared following any event of default the 
seven banks may take any action provided in the credit agreement 
including foreclosing on the equity in the casinos

if the commission is in fact convinced that the restructuring 
will leave the casinos more stable than it found them petitioners 
contention that we need not conduct a full stability hearing at 
this point is persuasive whether the record establishes the 
salutary effect of the restructuring is however a difficult and 
troublesome question 
it is obvious that the restructuring will confer substantial 
benefits on the trump organization and on the casinos as assets of 
that organization there will be 65 million in fresh capital and 
the debt service on 1 billion in existing loans will be deferred 
there will also be a moratorium on recourse against mr trump 
which will have the effect of protecting his assets including the 
equity in the casinos from creditors 
on the other hand there are features of this restructuring 
which could be extremely destabilizing to the casinos 
absent the restructuring if one of the casinos were to default 
on its existing debt it would presumably attempt to reach an 
accommodation with its lenders such as a debtforequity exchange 
failing that it might suffer a foreclosure of the casino hotel and 
a sale to a qualified buyer in the alternative it might go 
into bankruptcy 
the commission has dealt with all of these alternatives in the 
past and could surely deal with any of them again with respect to 
a trump property as of today none of these alternatives with 
respect to one trump casino would necessarily have any effect on 
the other two if the restructuring is effectuated however each 
of these alternatives will be an event of default and could 
lead to a foreclosure on the equity of all three properties thus 
the restructuring links the fate of the three properties and 
increases the likelihood that financial problems at one would lead 
to foreclosure of the others 
even more disturbing is the link the restructuring forges 
between the fate of the casinos and that of other trump assets if 
for example the trump shuttle goes into bankruptcy or employee 
benefit fund payments are not made at the new york plaza hotel or 
real estate taxes are not paid on the penn railroad yards the 
credit and override agreement banks could calla default 
we are thus being asked to tie the fate of the three casinos to 
a host of events which have nothing to do with their individual or 
collective financial condition 
we are being told that foreclosure on the casino equity whether 
through judgments or bankruptcy of the trump organization is a 
virtual certainty without this restructuring but may be avoided if 
the restructuring is consummated 
this is obviously a situation in which there is are no good 
answers for mr trump or for new jersey whether we approve or 
disapprove this restructuring our action will be fundamentally 
unsettling 
it is clear that absent some form of restructuring the casino 
equity will be reached by creditors holding liens on the noncasino 
assets second in view of the enormous time and effort put into 
this proposal and in view of the absence of noncasino assets in 
which the trump organization has substantial equity it is highly 
unlikely that rejection of this proposal will lead to another 
restructuring which will not include a pledge of the casino equity 
the risk of substantial economic disruption at the casinos will 
be less with the restructuring than it is without it

a growing supply of pork and a break in cash market prices 
combined wednesday to send hog futures prices skidding at the 
chicago mercantile exchange 
pork bellies also were big losers with the contract for 
delivery in august falling the limit 2 cents a pound for the second 
straight day 
on other markets petroleum futures surged ahead strongly 
grains and soybeans were mostly higher and gold advanced 
hog futures were dragged lower by the nearby october contract 
which was down as much as 110 cents a pound 
that contract reflected a fairly substantial break in fresh 
pork loins this week and in cash hogs said charles levitt 
senior livestock analyst for shearson lehman hutton inc 
in addition theres a seasonal increase in hogs being brought 
to market thats causing some supply problems he said 
bellie futures were undercut by two days of sharp declines in 
the price of fresh pork bellies 
an added problem for pork prices may appear friday when the usda 
issues its monthly cold storage report 
this report could show a very large supply of turkeys in 
storage levitt said if it does there could be some cheap 
turkeys around that could compete with some of the pork products 
during the fall and winter holiday seasons 
cattle prices settled higher rebounding from losses suffered 
after a government report last week showed a large increase in 
cattle placed on feed lots 
the big increase was in july and these animals wont be coming 
to market until the end of the year 
well still have some tightness this fall said levitt 
live cattle settled 15 cent to 42 cent higher with the 
contract for delivery in october at 7822 cents a pound feeder 
cattle were 35 cent lower to 35 cent higher with august at 8952 
cents a pound live hogs were 75 cent lower to 02 cent higher 
with october at 4855 cents a pound and frozen pork bellies were 
60 cent to the limit 2 cents lower with august at 4572 cents a 
pound 
deepening fears on the middle east crisis sent oil futures 
soaring past the 30 mark on the new york mercantile exchange for 
the first time since nov 26 1985 
west texas intermediate crude oil advanced the limit 1 on the 
distant contracts to 251 on the october delivery which settled 
at 3122 a barrel heating oil was 431 cents to 764 cents higher 
with september at 9135 cents a gallon and unleaded gasoline was 
295 cents to 566 cents higher with september at 10411 a gallon 
precious metals futures advanced on the commodity exchange in 
new york but lacked the volitility of previous days despite sharp 
movements in oil prices 
the situation in the middle east is too uncertain said john 
oconnell manager of futures research for refco inc in new york 
most of the guys trading in gold have turned a little 
cautious he said any fall in crude could hurt them as well 
gold futures settled 330 to 4 higher with the august contract 
at 411 a troy ounce 
grain and soybean futures prices were mostly a little higher on 
the chicago board of trade 
trading was mixed and sluggish through much of the session but 
prices improved on the belief that the soviet union is in the 
market for cooking oil 
rumors surfaced late the day that the russians were buying or 
interested in buying bottled vegetable oil from south america 
said victor lespinasse an assistant vice president with dean 
witter reynolds inc 
wheat futures were 2 cents to 3 cents higher with the september 
contract at 282 a bushel corn was 1 cents lower to 2 cents 
higher with september at 253 a bushel oats were unchanged to 1 
cent lower with september at 116 a bushel and soybeans were 3 
cents to 7 cents higher with august at 615 a bushel

each of the nations big three automakers 
on thursday are expected to give the united auto workers union 
comprehensive proposals for new threeyear contracts 
its likely that the uaw will not have much immediate reaction 
as they compare the documents from general motors corp ford motor 
co and chrysler corp 
the proposals will help the union decide probably on tuesday 
which company will be chosen as the unions target in this round of 
talks if tradition holds the union will use a contract reached 
with the target company as a pattern for contracts at the other two 
automakers most of the speculation about the target company 
centers on gm 
what happens here at these tables and at general motors and 
chrysler in the next few days will have a direct bearing as to who 
that target company will be uaw president owen bieber said 
wednesday during a visit to ford 
since all of them have indicated they would like to be the 
target they have a decision to make of whether they would be the 
quarterback or the substitute sitting on the bench 
automakers like to be the target since it gives them an 
opportunity to form a pattern agreement to their liking rather than 
one meeting the needs of a competitor 
chief ford negotiator jack hall declined wednesday to discuss 
the upcoming proposal saying only we think it is going to be 
responsive to the needs the union has expressed to us 
bieber has been making the rounds at each of the big three this 
week reminding negotiators that less than four weeks remain in the 
lives of the current agreements 
the three contracts cover more than 450000 active workers and 
expire sept 14 
bieber on wednesday visited ford where the atmosphere at the 
main bargaining table and in subcommittee meetings is less charged 
than at gm or chrysler 
as he did at gm on monday and was expected to do thursday at 
chrysler bieber said he was disappointed that ford had not offered 
a comprehensive proposal before now 
if i had my druthers i would wish that we would be further 
along than we are bieber said however i would also say that 
im convinced that there is ample time left to conclude an 
agreement provided that the pace picks up considerably now 
the uaw has been irritated at chrysler chief negotiator anthony 
st john talking about contract proposals with the media before 
describing them to the union st john said the company was 
interested in an employee ownership plan for the company forming a 
multiemployer healthcare trust to cut medical care costs and a 
new way to figure profit sharing 
uaw vice president stan marshall whos in charge of the 
chrysler department has said each of the proposals are as good as 
dead 
tensions rose at gm earlier this month when members of local 
659 at a flint parts plant walked off their jobs for six days in a 
local contract dispute 
that strike which affected production at seven assembly plants 
and a variety of component factories was unopposed by uaw national 
leaders it resulted in a contract guaranteeing the size of the 
work force at the plant for years to come 
the uaw has said job security is its top issue

pressure from competitors prompted several airlines wednesday to 
hold off fare increases even though the price of jet fuel keeps 
rising because of the persian gulf crisis 
american airlines continental airlines delta air lines and 
usair all said wednesday they would delay raising fares until aug 
30 
americans 53 percent fare increase originally was to have gone 
into effect thursday american based in fort worth texas cited 
competitive pressure for its delay the third since fare hikes were 
first announced aug 10 
if one airline decides to do something different they would 
gain a competitive market position and other airlines simply cannot 
allow that to happen said american spokeswoman mary oneill 
delta based in atlanta first planned to raise fares on aug 
15 and then this thursday but delayed the move to aug 30 in a 
competitive response to other airlines 
other major airlines have also responded to the middle east 
standoff by announcing a mixture of fare increases and discount 
rates designed to lure more passengers

the us commerce department has granted 
control data corp an export license to ship the most powerful 
computers ever sent to the soviet union from the west the company 
said tuesday 
control data will ship six cyber 960 mainframe computers worth a 
total of 32 million to the soviet union beginning in september 
the company said 
soviet president mikhail s gorbachev visited control data 
during his june stop in minnesota and viewed a demonstration of the 
cyber 960 computers gorbachev also spoke on the need for greater 
technological and commercial cooperation between the united states 
and the soviet union 
the computers were ordered by the soviet research and 
development institute of power engineering and will be used to 
analyze safety factors in the operation of civilian soviet nuclear 
power reactors 
the company applied for the export license last november and 
announced the soviet order on dec 12 1989 
control data worked with the us departments of commerce 
state defense and energy to put in place safeguards that the 
computers will be dedicated to safety analysis of civilian nuclear 
reactors the company said 
the soviet unions civilian nuclear power program is one of the 
largest in the world with about 50 plants in operation according 
to a control data statement last year half of the soviet unions 
nucleargenerated electricity was produced by plants designed by 
the institute that has ordered the control data computers the 
company said
