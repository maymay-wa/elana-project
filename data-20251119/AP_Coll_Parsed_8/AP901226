rep bill frenzel is retiring after 20 years 
in congress a move that mystifies many other lawmakers he 
explains it simply i have grown weary of 90hour weeks 
the 62yearold minnesota republican is leaving capitol hill at 
the peak of what both republicans and democrats call a productive 
house career 
hes highly respected by members on both sides of the aisle 
rep martin sabo dminn said 
as top republican on the house budget committee and one of the 
most outspoken fiscal conservatives on the taxwriting ways and 
means committee frenzel commanded national attention in the 
business community 
he also gained a reputation as one of capitol hills resident 
curmudgeons sometimes seasoning his observations with gentle 
sarcasm 
rep willis gradison rohio recalled that frenzel once 
described himself as a kind of doormat to be walked over by 
ambitious majority members 
i dont think thats true gradison added 
a fiscal conservative but prochoice on abortion frenzel was 
virtually assured of winning reelection for as long as he liked in 
his third district taking in the prosperous southern and western 
suburbs of minneapolis 
but the job proved exasperating at times frenzel said in an 
interview part of it was the grind of early morning breakfasts 
allday meetings and late night sessions on the house floor he 
said with only a touch of exaggeration that added up to 90hour 
weeks 
and these marathon rounds were compounded by agonizing deadlock 
over how to cut the ballooning federal deficit 
the budget was an acute frustration frenzel said i cant 
express how horrible it was over the last six months 
he tried repeatedly without success to impose acrosstheboard 
cuts on spending bills 
in october frenzel put his personal popularity on the line to 
plead with house members to support a deficitreduction package of 
500 billion over five years reached after months of negotiations 
between congressional leaders and the bush administration 
the lawmakers gave him a standing ovation but voted against him 
frenzels favorite targets over the years have included a 
burgeoning federal bureaucracy protectionism in foreign trade 
congressional perquisites and a campaign finance system he deemed 
out of control 
he played a major role in writing campaign finance reform 
legislation following the watergate scandals and was dubbed the 
father of the federal election commission 
the legislation put size limits on political contributions and 
required campaigns to report them to the commission its files in 
turn provide the public with a listing of who gives money to the 
candidates how much and how the funds are spent the measure is 
credited with ending the era in which wealthy fat cats 
bankrolled congressional officeseekers 
frenzel later became an expert in tax policy he fought 
successfully in 1978 and 1981 for cuts in the capital gains tax he 
believed would stimulate economic growth 
in 1990 after years of trying he got the house to impose 
limits on free congressional mail what frenzel called the last 
black hole of congress 
just what comes next is uncertain 
frenzel said he would like to become a political analyst or 
resident sage with a think tank or a private company 
but he did not rule out a bush administration post and his name 
has come up in connection with the position of us trade 
representative the incumbent carla hills has been mentioned as a 
possible successor to pete wilson who is leaving the senate to be 
governor of california 
many former members of congress who like frenzel do not want to 
leave washington wind up staying on capitol hill as lobbyists 
but frenzel plainspoken as usual said that was out of the 
question 
if i dont want to be the dog he said i dont know why 
id want to be the tail of the dog

an internal audit by the agriculture 
department says field offices of the farmers home administration 
are often still sloppy in determining whether producers qualify for 
emergency loans 
the departments office of inspector general said the review 
involved fmha emergency loans made to help farmers recover from 
losses caused by drought and other natural disasters in 1988 
in its semiannual report for the period april 1 through sept 
30 auditors said they checked 71 loans totaling 21 million in 18 
county fmha offices in four states locations were not identified 
our review disclosed that controls were not adequate to ensure 
that loans were made only to eligible farmers in correct amounts 
the report said we found that county offices approved 43 
borrowers for excessive loans totaling over 600000 
the report which is required by law every six months said 
similar error rates in the fmha emergency loan program had been 
reported in prior audits going back to 1983 
emergency loans nationally totaled 735 million in the 1989 
fiscal year and represent a small part of total fmha financial 
activity overall the report said the agency as of june 30 1990 
had more than 11 million borrowers who owed about 523 billion 
but the flaws in the emergency loan program raise old questions 
about fmhas attention to proper procedures when dispensing federal 
credit and aid to impoverished farmers 
for example the report said fmha had not crosschecked with 
other department agencies notably the agricultural stabilization 
and conservation service and the federal crop insurance corp to 
determine eligibility for crop losses 
we found 42 cases where fmha personnel had not received or not 
used complete records of acres yields or benefits from ascs the 
report said in addition current law requires fmha to use 
average monthly market prices to compute loss amounts however we 
found that these prices were not always used 
the uditors also found the fmhas national office in washington 
had not ensured that state officials of the agency were in full 
compliance with the rules 
the report recommended that fmha review emergency loan action 
plans of state offices update loan training conduct field 
assessment reviews and take other steps to improve administration 
of the program 
in a related finding by auditors the fmha was said to have 
insufficient controls to ensure that county offices consider 
prospective borrowers participation in the 10year conservation 
reserve program when seeking loans or servicing of existing debts 
under the crp farmers can idle fragile crop land and receive 
annual federal rental payments in return the idled land must be 
planted in protective grasses or trees 
auditors checked 97 cases in which fmha borrowers had land in 
the 10year conservation program and found errors in 82 of them 
only one of 13 county offices checked had obtained lists of crp 
payments from ascs offices and most of the farm and home plans 
filled out for borrowers seeking loans or restructuring did not 
show the crp payments 
 
washington ap agriculture department scientists say 
orangered oriental persimmons can be a rich source of vitamin c 
jerry a payne of the departments agricultural research service 
said in a report issued here on wednesday that certain varieties of 
the oriental persimmon provide 218 milligrams of ascorbic acid per 
100 grams of fruit 
oranges and other citrus fruit normally contain 40 to 70 
milligrams of ascorbic acid per 100 grams of fruit he said 
payne who works at the agencys southeastern fruit and tree nut 
research laboratory in byron ga said oriental persimmons are 2 
to 4 inches in diameter and should not be confused with the 
smaller seedier american type that grows wild in the south 
the vitamin analysis was done in cooperation with ron 
eitenmiller of the university of georgia 
weve had good success growing the oriental persimmon as far 
north as central georgia payne said this is unusual 
especially since the fruit is as tasty and as sweet as those grown 
in california hawaii and florida 
roy lee smith who grows fruit and vegetables in sumter county 
ga said he has an experimental plot of fuyu a japanese variety 
of persimmon he said the crop may have promise in the southeast 
but the market would have to be determined smith said 
timing and selection of the best varieties to grow would be 
important

most americans have not planned for critical 
medical decisions they some day may have no control over but nancy 
cruzans righttodie struggle made them more aware of their 
options experts say 
the publicity surrounding ms cruzans case said doron weber a 
spokesman for the society for the right to die generated a 500 
percent increase in the requests we receive 
weber said his new yorkbased organization has filled 800000 
requests for sample living wills and similar documents since the 
supreme courts decision in the cruzan case last june 
the volume from all over the country which we tracked 
directly from the cruzan case was incredible we had to start a 
night shift he said 
john pickering a washington lawyer who heads the american bar 
associations commission on legal problems of the elderly said ms 
cruzans case increased tremendously the publics knowledge of 
the existence of such documents as a living will and a durable 
power of attorney for health care 
i think this increased awareness will help prevent the tragic 
kind of situation nancy cruzan and her parents found themselves 
in he said 
ms cruzan 33 died wednesday 12 days after a feeding tube 
that had kept her alive in a vegetative state for eight years was 
removed at her parents request the decision was controversial 
david osteen of the antiabortion national right to life 
committee said her death diminishes hope for thousands of 
medically dependent people nationwide 
ed grant of americans united for life expressed sympathy for 
what ms cruzans family has suffered through the past eight 
years 
he said however that his organization is troubled by a move 
toward passive euthanasia 
the cruzan familys effort to end the lifesustaining treatment 
was the focus of a threeyear legal battle that led to a landmark 
supreme court decision june 25 
the court recognized a constitutional right of competent adults 
to refuse all medical treatment but it ruled against ms cruzans 
parents because they had not offered clear and convincing 
evidence she would have wanted to die 
the case returned to missouri courts and a state judge allowed 
removal of the feeding tube after hearing new evidence that ms 
cruzan had said she would never want to live like a vegetable 
pickering said the cruzan case also was instrumental in passage 
of a new federal law originally called the patient 
selfdetermination act 
this is a farreaching piece of very good social 
legislation he said it will require all hospitals and nursing 
homes that receive medicare or medicaid funding to tell all 
patients of their righttodie options under their state laws 
the federal law takes effect in november 1991 
right now only 5 to 10 percent of all adults have a living 
will or a durable health care power of attorney pickering said 
i hope this new law will help raise that percentage 
all but nine states have specific statutes spelling out 
righttodie rights but in some of those nine states 
massachusetts michigan nebraska new jersey new york ohio 
pennsylvania rhode island and south dakota court rulings and 
common law provide some right of individual determination

in the barracks or the locker room nobody 
thinks twice about threatening to whip kick or otherwise manhandle 
the oppositions rear end its different when presidents get down 
and graphic 
that may make it an effective way to turn up the volume when the 
man in the white house doesnt think somebody is paying attention 
as in president bushs holiday message to saddam hussein 
if we get into an armed situation hes going to get his ass 
kicked 
there are certain amenities about the purposeful presidential 
use of such terminology for public consumption 
its not done on tape or on camera except inadvertently better 
to have it relayed second hand leaving just a little room for 
doubt that a leader so eminent would talk that way 
and it cant be done often or it would become too ordinary to 
attract attention 
besides theres always a risk of a backlash a former governor 
of massachusetts francis w sargent once used the aword at a 
governors conference and said his mother called to tell him she 
was going to wash his mouth out with soap 
then again its hardly an xrated term and it is right there 
in the dictionary ass vulgar slang the buttocks bushs 
latest usage was widely quoted on radio and television and in 
print 
after bush met with a group of congressmen on dec 20 rep 
elton gallegly rcalif said the president had told them that he 
doesnt think saddam hussein understands that there really will be 
war if he doesnt get out of kuwait 
the greatest potential for preventing any kind of an armed 
confrontation is to make sure that saddam hussein be made really 
aware that to quote him that if we get into an armed situation 
hes going to get his ass kicked gallegly said 
while others confirmed the remark bush was circumspect asked 
later whether it was an accurate quotation the president arched 
his eyebrows and said nothing 
hed been more forthcoming after accidentally putting a similar 
observation on the record during the 1984 campaign when he was 
vice president we tried to kick a little ass last night he 
said after a campaign debate with rep geraldine a ferraro his 
democratic opponent bush made the comment while shaking hands with 
dockworkers at a campaign rally in new jersey unaware that there 
was a boom microphone close enough to pick up his words 
later on he said he wasnt apologizing i stand behind it i 
use it all the time my kids use it everybody who competes in 
sports uses it 
ronald reagan expressed some doubt about the campaign comment 
saying he wasnt inclined to believe his vice president had said 
it 
reagan himself didnt go beyond keister which is slang for 
rump 
in 1983 irked that information about his budget and other white 
house business was finding its way into print reagan ordered a 
crackdown ive had it up to my keister with these leaks he 
told his staff 
no such gentler euphemism would do for jimmy carter when sen 
edward m kennedy was preparing to challenge him for the 1980 
democratic presidential nomination 
if kennedy runs ill whip his ass carter said at a white 
house dinner with democratic congressmen 
i was startled said thenrep william m brodhead dmich 
i thought my ears were deceiving me i said excuse me mr 
president what did you say and carter replied if kennedy runs 
ill whip his ass 
he did and carter did but strong words arent enough reagan 
won the white house

a senior national police official says soviet 
troops in eastern germany are now deserting at the rate of 15 to 30 
a week a newspaper reported today 
die welt also quoted the head of the federal police office 
hansludwig zachert as saying police daily register 20 to 30 legal 
violations attributable to soviet troops mostly thefts and traffic 
violations

domestic security the newspaper said 
the report comes as many germans have tried to boost morale of

doctors are excited about a genetically engineered 
blood clotting agent that could let hemophiliacs treat themselves 
with preventive injections the way diabetes sufferers do 
the clotting protein made by gene splicing also should end fears 
hemophiliacs might catch bloodborne diseases such as aids 
about 60 percent of hemophiliacs in the united states were 
unknowingly infected with hiv the aids virus during the early 
1980s the virus contaminated clotting proteins derived from human 
blood 
new purification techniques have made bloodderived hemophilia 
treatments free of hiv but some experts worry that other microbes 
might infiltrate this treatment again if blood remains the sole 
source 
hemophiliacs have an inherited disorder that prevents them from 
making enough factor viii a protein essential for blood clotting 
to stop bleeding after accidents and operations and to prevent 
damaging bleeding in the joints they must take factor viii 
injections 
two companies are testing recombinant factor viii made through 
gene splicing techniques that should provide the treatment without 
possible contamination from microbes or impurities 
we are all tremendously excited about this it represents a 
tremendous advance said dr jeanne m lusher of childrens 
hospital of michigan in detroit 
lusher participated in the first largescale testing of 
recombinant factor viii the study in todays new england journal 
of medicine showed that it works just as well as the natural 
variety 
alan brownstein executive director of the national hemophilia 
foundation said that absolutely safe factor viii could allow 
hemophiliacs to take regular preventive doses of factor viii just 
as diabetics take insulin 
it offers the potential for people with hemophilia to have an 
interim cure brownstein said 
the reason why people with hemophilia do not treat themselves 
as diabetics do preventively is because we are still talking about 
a humansource product he said if we find a product around 
which there is zero question then people could basically be rid of 
the potential of bleeding episodes 
last year baxter healthcare reported on preliminary use of its 
variety of recombinant factor viii on two patients in the latest 
report cutter biological described results of testing its 
competing product on 107 hemophiliacs both forms of factor viii 
are being considered for approval by the us food and drug 
administration 
the results were excellent said cutters dr richard s 
schwartz we could demonstrate that biologically recombinant 
factor viii behaves similarly to plasmaderived factor viii 
most of the patients in the study had been using the genetically 
engineered factor viii for nearly two years the treatment 
effectively controlled their bleeding and caused no unwanted side 
effects 
there is an inherent risk with using any human plasmaderived 
blood product lusher said the main advantage is that since 
these products are not derived in any way from human blood there 
is no risk of transmitting human bloodborne viruses 
the recombinant products also should help assure a steady 
supply two years ago hemophiliacs experienced a shortage of 
factor viii after a mix up in hiv screening at the american red 
cross a primary producer forced it to withhold about 7 percent of 
the nations total production

the agriculture department is recalling 502 
pounds of canadian kosher frankfurters from a monsey ny retail 
store after federal inspectors found contamination by food 
poisoning organisms 
usda authorities said wednesday that the store the meat 
showcase is cooperating in the recall of continental strictly 
kosher beef frankfurters made in montreal canada 
it is the only store in the united states that has received the 
product said the departments food safety and inspection service 
the 14ounce packages are labeled product of canada and bear 
the crown inspection seal of canada they also bear the mark 
establishment number 472 and have no sellby date 
the problem was discovered by usda inspectors in a routine 
import reinspection in buffalo ny 
ronald j prucha associated administrator of the usda agency 
said no illnesses have been reported he said consumers should 
return the suspected franks to the place of purchase 
the suspected bacteria can cause listeriosis which was 
described as a rare but potentially serious disease 
listeriosis is believed to pose little risk for healthy 
people the agency said but it said those with weakened immune 
systems including infants the elderly and the chronically ill are 
most vulnerable 
symptoms in adults include the sudden onset of flulike symptoms 
such as fever chills headache backache and sometimes abdominal 
pain and diarrhea newborns can exhibit respiratory distress 
refusal to drink and vomiting 
consumers with questions about the recall can phone the 
departments tollfree hot line at 18005354555 between 10 am

president bush spending the holidays at camp 
david md faces a full platter of unfinished business when he 
returns to washington next week and what a difference a year has 
made 
the final days of 1989 found bush enjoying the holiday season on 
a friends ranch in beeville texas basking in the success of the 
us invasion of panama 
the most pressing controversy at the time it seemed was 
whether us armed forces were right to blast the vatican embassy 
in panama city with rock music in an effort to drive manuel noriega 
out of hiding 
the toppled panamanian dictator did flee the embassy into us 
hands in early january and bush saw his approval ratings in public 
opinion polls soar to 80 percent 
now 12 months later complex foreign and domestic policy crises 
confront the president and none of the major problems seem likely 
to have a quick or decisive resolution 
in the past year the president abandoned his nonewtaxes 
pledge got bloodied in a knockdown budget debate with congress and 
saw his party lose seats in the november midterm elections 
he also ordered the largest deployment of us forces since the 
vietnam war watched the nation slip towards a recession and wound 
up taking actions that angered civil rights activists republican 
conservatives environmentalists and broccoli farmers 
the most demanding piece of unfinished business of course is 
the persian gulf crisis and the jan 15 deadline set by the 
united nations at the administrations behest for saddam hussein 
to pull his iraqi troops out of kuwait 
bush has not signaled whether he will mount a military strike 
soon after that date and even though it now appears unlikely the 
united states will act against saddam on jan 15 bush told 
congressional leaders last week that he surely would not wait as 
long as summer 
there have been no signs that saddam is any nearer to buckling 
to the pressure of international sanctions and the usled 400000 
troops deployed against him in saudi arabia and the persian gulf 
after months of dashing around the country and the world bush 
was keeping an unusually low profile in his 11day stay at the 
presidential retreat in the catoctin mountains of maryland about 
60 miles northwest of washington 
he just needs to recharge his batteries said a white house 
official speaking on the condition of anonymity 
hell need fresh batteries for the coming weeks 
congress returns on jan 3 two days after the president and 
his persian gulf policy will be the no 1 topic after both houses 
take care of the business of organizing themselves 
also facing the president is a decision on a budget for fiscal 
1992 the first one under the 500 billion fiveyear 
deficitcutting agreement struck between the white house and 
congress in the fall 
the economic slump and the cost of operation desert shield will 
send the deficit soaring complicating the job of putting together 
a budget the fiscal blueprint will be submitted to congress the 
first week in february 
furthermore bush apparently is going to abandon yet another 
campaign pledge as he works out the new spending plan his call for 
a cut in capital gains taxes 
although the administration contends that cutting the tax rate 
on capital gains profits from the sale of stock real estate or 
other assets would generate growth and gain revenue for the 
treasury it cant prove it 
and under the budget pact anytime a tax cut or spending 
increase is proposed it has to be offset by a tax increase or a 
spending cut in another area ten days ago bush said he would give 
up the capital gains idea because he could not find the savings 
elsewhere in the budget perhaps as much as 20 billion by some 
estimates to pay for it 
some other decisions facing the president 
he must select a new chairman of the republican national 
committee to replace his first choice former national drug policy 
director william bennett who spurned the offer after being told by 
white house lawyers hed have to give up a lucrative book contract 
and outside speaking engagements 
he soon must fill a vacancy on the federal reserve board 
created more than six months ago with the resignation of vice 
chairman manuel johnson 
he must complete work on a longdelayed national energy 
strategy the plan is snagged in an internal administration feud 
over how much the government should involve itself in conservation 
efforts

a late christmas card from your 
procrastinating uncle harold wont be the only thing missing from 
your mailbox today your annual greetings from the internal revenue 
service wont be in the mail either 
the irs after years of sending its tax packages out on the day 
following christmas has decided to give taxpayers a brief 
reprieve 
this year the forms will go out on friday three days following 
christmas 
we want to move it away from the christmas holiday to allow 
folks to enjoy that period of the year as long as they possibly can 
before we throw a wet blanket on them said arthur altman 
director of the irs tax forms division 
the packages which cost the government 29 million to print and 
mail have been waiting at local post offices for weeks and a few 
taxpayers may have already received theirs from eagerbeaver letter 
carriers who disregarded the dec 28 date 
however the bulk of the packages will be distributed in the 
period from friday through the first week in january 
the tax forms for the second year in a row will feature few 
changes a pleasant relief following the massive revisions brought 
about by the 1986 rewrite of the tax law 
among the modifications this year 
the personal exemption the amount you may exempt from 
taxation for yourself your spouse and each dependent increases to 
2050 up from 2000 last year 
the standard deduction claimed by people who do not itemize 
rises to 3250 for a single person up from 3100 last year the 
exemption for a couple increases to 5450 up from 5200 last 
year 
families with income as high as 20264 may qualify for an 
earnedincome credit up from a limit of 19340 last year the 
maximum credit available is 953 
the basic tax rates remain the same at 15 percent 28 percent 
and 33 percent but the tax brackets have been widened so that more 
income will be taxed at a lower rate thus compensating for the 
effects of inflation 
only 10 percent of interest paid on credit card debt auto 
loans and other personal debt will be deductible on 1990 returns 
down from 20 percent last year 
the irs said it expects 113 million returns will be filed this 
year and that 70 percent of all taxpayers will get refunds the 
average refund last year was 900 
twothirds of all taxpayers are expected to file the long form 
1040 which is used by persons who itemize deductions the other 
onethird will use either the simpler form 1040a or the nineline 
form 1040ez 
in an effort to encourage use of the shorter forms which are 
easier to process the irs made an important change to the form 
1040a this year which will allow 45 million elderly persons to use 
it to report retirement income they previously could report only on 
the longer 1040 
these taxpayers will receive the shorter form with an 
explanation of the change 
the irs is again encouraging people eager for their refund 
checks to use an electronic filing service the fee normally ranges 
from 25 to 50 but it usually means a refund check will be mailed 
out in two weeks to three weeks versus the five weeks to six weeks 
it takes to process a refund from a paper return 
people who need tax forms other than those included in their 
package can call a new irs tollfree telephone number 
1800taxform 18008293676 
one new feature in this years tax package represents an effort 
by the irs to bury a myth concerning the preprinted mailing labels 
which many people have feared contained codes making the taxpayer 
vulnerable to audits 
the irs has gone through and explained what each of the letters 
and numbers means on the labels in the hopes that more people will 
use them and thus cut down on irs processing errors 
we are trying to assure taxpayers than none of the numbers in 
the label are a secret code that says audit this return

dismissing demands that he stand aside sen 
donald w riegle jr says he will keep plugging away as 
chairman of the senate banking committee while defending his 
conduct against new ethical questions in the keating five savings 
and loan scandal 
riegle intends to convene hearings early next year on providing 
money for the resolution trust corp the agency selling off assets 
of defunct thrifts and he has prepared legislation to rescue the 
government fund that guarantees bank customers deposits 
he likely will call federal reserve chairman alan greenspan to 
testify in february just the type of setting that attracts heavy 
media coverage and gives lawmakers a forum for expressing concern 
about the victims of a slowing economy 
but while the michigan democrat busies himself for work 
overseeing an industry in financial distress he also must defend 
his own integrity against fresh questions in the heavily publicized 
keating five hearings and fend off republican calls to relinquish 
his committee chairmanship 
he has compromised himself and he should step down said 
ronna romney a republican national committee member from detroit 
theres no question that his behavior has been highly unethical 
hes become a symbol of this whole scandal of all thats wrong 
with the system in washington 
the detroit news issued a similr call earlier this month after 
james grogan thrift executive charles h keating jrs former 
lobbyist and corporate counsel gave the most damaging testimony 
against riegle since ethics committee hearings began nov 15 into 
the ties between the lawmakers and keating 
grogan the first keating insider to go before the panel 
appeared under limited immunity meaning his testimony could not be 
used against him unless he committed perjury 
he insisted that riegle had proposed and arranged an april 2 
1987 meeting between chief banking regulator edwin gray and four 
senators to discuss problems of keatings irvine califbased 
lincoln savings and loan the institution later was taken over by 
the government at an expected cost to taxpayers of 2 billion 
the 1987 meetings are the focus of the ethics committees probe 
of riegle and sens alan cranston dcalif john glenn dohio 
dennis deconcini dariz and john mccain rariz the committee 
is investigating whether the senators improperly intervened with 
regulators on behalf of keatings thrift after receiving a total of 
13 million on contributions from the businessman and his 
associates 
grogans assertion directly contradicted riegles sworn 
statement to the committee in march that he arranged neither that 
meeting nor another a week later involving five senators 
including himself and regulators from the federal home loan bank 
board 
but grogan also said he did not believe keatings donations to 
the five senators prompted them to assist keating in fighting 
thrift regulators or that keating expected such 
riegle 52 whose political fortunes have plummeted at home has 
been absent from most of the keating hearings as have the other 
four senators who are under investigation he has strongly denied 
any wrongdoing the hearings are in recess until jan 2 
riegle received 78250 from keating and associates for his 1988 
reelection campaign and returned the money following newspaper 
disclosures of the contributors ties to keating saying he wanted 
to avoid an appearance of conflict of interest he denies the 
donations motivated him to help keating 
in an interview riegle shrugged off his difficulties 
its fair to say im a battlehardened veteran of everything 
that comes with this job he said you take everything in 
stride and ive learned to do that were just plugging away 
democrats meet early in january to vote on committee 
chairmanships and theres been no hint that riegle might be asked 
to step down 
in washington even the political opposition is standing firm 
behind riegle 
i didnt see any evidence this year that his riegles 
performance had been impaired in the least sen jake garn 
rutah said 
garn said he would reserve judgment on riegles future until the 
ethics committee concludes its work i havent seen anything that 
shows me any ethics violations but thats a very preliminary 
opinion he said 
whatever the outcome of the keating probe riegles political 
fortunes seem to hang in the balance in a detroit news survey 
earlier this fall of 800 registered voters 62 percent said they 
would not vote for riegle this year had he been on the ballot and 
23 percent said they would riegle was elected to a third term in 
1988 with 60 percent of the vote 
that survey was taken before the public hearings began that 
produced grogans testimony 
the lobbyists testimony followed assertions by ethics committee 
counsel robert s bennett that riegle played a much more 
instrumental role in initiating the april 2 meeting with chairman 
gray than he recalls 
riegle emotionally defended himself in an opening satement last 
month 
his attorney thomas green cited inconsistencies in grogans 
testimony and described the disagreement over riegles role as 
not a big deal

trade analysts in the agriculture department 
say it is still unclear whether eastern europe will emerge as a 
long term thriving market for us farm products 
in fact there is a possibility eastern europe will develop into 
a competitor of american grain producers 
mike dwyer of the departments foreign agricultural service said 
many people hope these countries will experience rapid growth as 
they move toward market economies 
but it is possible that eastern europe may show economic decline 
in the short run if so he said that could mean some us export 
opportunities as the countries try to make up the gap between 
supply and demand 
dwyer whose comments appeared in the january issue of 
agexporter magazine said he was less optimistic about us 
sales to eastern europe over the long haul 
over the next five years there is a real possibility that 
eastern europe excluding the soviet union could become a 
significant net exporter of some bulk agricultural products such 
as grains and thus emerge as a competitor with us he said 
until recently they have been only marginal net exporters of 
grain 
dwyer said he thinks certain sectors will emerge sooner than 
others as the eastern european countries retool their economies and 
global competitiveness 
i believe agriculture primarily grain and livestock will be 
among the regions first sectors to emerge from this transition 
he said light industry such as textiles and leather also 
should do well 
many of the countries already have fairly substantial farm 
economies and fertile land dwyer said consequently some may 
emphasize grain and livestock products for export 
while over the long run this does not bode well for expanding 
us grain sales it does offer opportunities for oil seeds 
soybeans and meal as a livestock feed for east european herds 
which i expect will increase he said herd increases in turn 
may also boost sales of us genetics 
but eastern europes desire to export should also create some 
demand for us cotton and cattle hides for the manufacture of 
textiles and leather 
over the very long term as their economies really start to 
grow and their incomes rise these east european countries may 
develop into markets for us highvalue products that have 
already been processed dwyer said but that is going to take a 
while and we can expect intense competition from eastern europe 
itself as well as the european community 
 
washington ap the soviet union has signed a new cooperative 
agreement with the agriculture department to continue looking for 
natural enemies of insect pests and moscow sent along hundreds of 
parasitic wasp eggs to help seal the pact 
richard soper of the departments agricultural research service 
said the eggs which were laid in larvae of the apple coddling 
moth were turned over to the agency recently by nikolai popov of 
kishinev moldavia 
popov is vice director of the allunion institute of biological 
methods in plant protection he gave the larvae to the usda agency 
on dec 20 
the usda scientists hope the infested larvae can help conquer 
the coddling moth a major pest of apples in the united states 
this pest is the proverbial worm in the apple soper said in 
a report issued by the agency but parasitic wasps lay their eggs 
on or inside the worm young wasps that emerge from the eggs then 
feed on the worm 
soper said the wasps dont sting people or animals he is the 
agencys national program leader for research on natural or 
biological pest controls 
the new cooperative agreement signed by popov and usda officials 
calls for further scientific explorations next year in the soviet 
union and the united states 
 
washington ap reserve stockpiles of frozen food going into 
the holiday season were generally larger than they were a year ago

butter up 37 percent cheese 29 percent eggs 29 percent fruit 
juices 17 percent chicken 14 percent turkey 29 percent 
vegetables 18 percent and potatoes 7 percent 
inventories of frozen fruit however were down 7 percent the 
report said total red meat supplies were down 3 percent because of

president bush is spending a quiet christmas 
vacation at a secluded mountaintop retreat but aides say the 
looming showdown in the persian gulf is never far from his mind 
bush celebrated christmas with his wife barbara his children 
and grandchildren in the privacy of the presidential lodge at camp 
david md the menu of the familys christmas dinner included 
turkey sweet potatoes green beans and pie 
the white house declined to reveal other details of the 
presidential christmas apparently under orders to allow bush a 
wellneeded rest after the hectic months that began with iraqs 
aug 2 invasion of kuwait 
but camp david is only 60 miles northwest of the white house 
allowing bush to be close at hand in case an emergency arises in 
the gulf aides said thats the reason he called off his annual 
christmas turkey hunt in texas 
to keep on top of developments bush has been getting daily 
reports since arriving at camp david last friday for his 11day 
vacation he spends several hours working each day spokesman steve 
hart said 
the president returns to washington on jan 1 just two days 
before congress and he is expected to face some pressing questions 
from lawmakers regarding his intentions toward iraq 
two weeks later on jan 15 is the deadline set by the un 
security council for iraqi withdrawal from kuwait the council has 
authorized the united states and its allies to forcibly remove 
iraqi troops if they fail to withdraw from kuwait by that date 
the administration also is still trying to arrange a visit to 
baghdad by secretary of state james a baker iii bush proposed 
last month that baker meet with iraqi president saddam hussein to 
press home the administrations determination to use all means 
necessary to evict iraq from kuwait 
but iraq insists the meeting take place on jan 12 only three 
days before the un deadline and bush thinks thats cutting it 
too close 
baker who said he would be willing to forgo christmas at home 
if saddam would see him on dec 25 spent the holiday in his 
hometown of houston 
bush conferred christmas eve with his top military advisers 
defense secretary dick cheney and gen colin l powell chairman of 
the joint chiefs of staff 
both just back from five days in saudi arabia reportedly told 
bush that commanders in the field predict us troops wont be 
ready to fight until the beginning or middle of february

the pentagon has banned the news 
media from covering the bob hope tour and toned down the show to 
avoid offending the saudis and prevent the iraqis from using the 
visit as propaganda fodder 
hope was to take his show to the marines in the northern saudi 
desert today wrapping up a threeday tour 
the 87yearold comedian whose tours for us forces over the 
past 50 years have included such sirens as joey heatherton and 
brooke shields lamented on tuesday that he had to leave behind 
marie osmond and the pointer sisters 
the saudis prohibit female performers 
hope joked about having to do an allmale show with only his 
wife dolores to sing white christmas as a finale 
the comedian also told a news conference tuesday that he 
eliminated a lot of jokes so as not to offend the rulers of 
this moslem desert kingdom 
i know exactly what theyre doing the kings running the 
place they have their religion and their beliefs and you have to 
kind of abide by it he said what bothers me is they dont 
want any entertainment and they still invited me 
hope is not the first entertainer to be restricted during 
operation desert shield comedian steve martins visit in october 
was kept lowkey and ms shields reportedly was asked not to come 
most women in the country appear in public completely veiled and 
the sexes are not supposed to mingle outside private homes 
the us central command said in a statement tuesday that it 
restricted coverage of hopes threeday tour for security reasons 
and because media coverage however wellintentioned has a very 
great likelihood of being exploited by the iraqis for propaganda 
purposes 
the iraqi government has attempted to stir up moslem 
fundamentalist opposition to the presence of western culture in 
saudi arabia home to islams holiest sites 
the us military has been at pains not to offend sensibilities 
in this moslem kingdom where all other religions are banned 
hope said he made seven stops on christmas eve including a show 
for 7000 troops in riyadh the saudi capital 
among those in the audience at the riyadh show were gen norman 
schwarzkopf commander of us forces in the persian gulf and his 
deputy lt gen calvin waller 
waller made headlines last week when he said us combat units 
wont be ready for war with iraq by the unimposed jan 15 
deadline for iraqi troops to pull out of kuwait or face possible 
attack 
hope said he got a lot of laughs when he told the troops 
that president bush called waller and said from now on youll 
be known by your first name an allusion to saddam hussein who 
is also commonly known by his first name 
any jokes about saddam 
ive been working on hussein a hell of a lot hope said 
saddam he thinks hes saddam santa claus now saddam claus 
thats his new nickname now and you know what saddam is spelled 
backwards mad ass 
the comedian who put on nine christmas shows in vietnam said 
he hoped these would be his last performances in the gulf region 
i hope we never have another war he said

a shooting war in the middle east probably 
would cause sudden turmoil in the nations securities and futures 
markets but they should recover quickly most market professionals 
say 
in new york big board officials point to a series of 
circuitbreakers developed after the 1987 stock market crash to 
slow down computerized trading or temporarily halt it if the market 
plunges or skyrockets more than 250 points 
should there be a surge in buying selling or volume these 
circuit breakers would serve to slow the market down and give 
everyone a chance to assess what has taken place and make an 
investment decision new york stock exchange spokesman richard 
torrenzano said 
if you had the outbreak of a sudden major shooting war in the 
middle east i suspect that short term the market would go into a 
freefall said robert kirby chairman of capital guardian trust 
co in los angeles but i also wouldnt be surprised at all if it 
closed higher two or three days later he said 
the chicago mercantile exchange has said it would stop trading 
stock index futures contracts based on a range of stocks if the 
new york stock exchange closed but the nyse isnt saying what it 
will do in case of war 
im not going to say theres a plan in place or not in place 
until you know whats been presented to you said richard 
torrenzano a spokesman 
kirby a member of the commission appointed by president reagan 
to investigate the 1987 crash said a suspension of trading is 
the only fair way to handle this kind of situation 
market shutdowns except for the occasional power outage in new 
york or chicago are rare 
the nyse shut down at the beginning of world war i from july 31 
to nov 28 1914 
that was largely because of fears that goldhungry europe would 
sell off its securities in new york and take the gold home 
sparking a possible economic collapse in this country said stock 
market historian robert sobel 
the new york markets also shut for the end of world war ii in 
1945 and after president john f kennedy was assassinated in 1963 
sobel said he didnt think the stock market will panic if war 
breaks out in the gulf because this is an event that we can look 
ahead and think about when it happens people have plans all 
ready 
the 1987 stock plunge of more than 500 points he said caught 
a lot of people unaware its the ones that catch you unaware that 
cause panics 
federal regulators say they have plans to head off panic in the 
markets should the shooting start but what those plans are 
theyre not saying 
the securities and exchange commission which oversees the 
stocks bonds and mutual funds markets says it has developed plans 
for emergencies and has been discussing them with the exchanges 
the commodity futures trading commission which oversees futures 
contracts in key commodities such as oil also has planned for 
disruptions a cftc insider says plans include coordinating 
information among various markets 
but do we have a plan so that if x happens well do this no 
because i think whatever x we put down or y or z there would be q 
r and s on top of that said the source who spoke on condition 
of anonymity 
without war the dow jones industrial average a key stock 
market indicator is expected to break through 3000 points in 
1991 said yale hirsch who produces the stock traders almanac 
but if the crisis ends badly the dow could sink to 2000 next 
year he added

john tower says its not what his former 
senate colleagues did to him that hurts its the way they did it 
tower a fourterm texas senator and former republican chairman 
of the senate armed services committee suffered an ignominious 
defeat in march 1989 when the senate turned thumbs down on his 
nomination to become secretary of defense 
what was happening to me could have happened in an evil 
kafkaesque society tower writes in a new book it couldnt 
happen in the united states it couldnt happen in the us 
senate 
in the book consequences a personal and political memoir 
tower denies allegations aired before the senate that he was an 
excessive drinker and a womanizer who held close ties to defense 
contractors 
he also tries to settle a few scores 
sen j james exon dneb is a genuine boozer tower 
writes sen ernest hollings dsc is the senate bully a 
study in arrogance and pomposity sen robert c byrd dwva 
has a tendency to resort to flatulent indignation 
he says sen sam nunn dga the chairman of the senate armed 
services committee who led the fight against the nomination was 
motivated by presidential ambitions 
if nunn had suspected that he would end up looking like an 
unscrupulous mudslinger who would stop at nothing to achieve his 
objectives perhaps he would have satisfied himself with making a 
few critical comments expressing whatever reservations he may have 
felt even to the point of indicating that i was on probation and 
then voting to approve the nomination tower writes 
but sam nunn was blinded by his own ambition 
nunns press secretary scott williams said the senator would 
have no comment on the book which is to be published by little 
brown and co in february 
calls to other lawmakers last week also drew no responses 
tower says nunn was upset from the beginning about his 
nomination by bush 
he believes that nunn who played a major role in advising 
michael dukakis on defense issues during the 1988 presidential 
campaign was upset by towers attacks on dukakis policies tower 
campaigned for bush 
in addition tower had advised former president reagan to veto 
the 1989 defense authorization bill legislation that nunn helped 
work out tower suggests nunn still was smarting from reagans 
decision 
i did not regard nunn as an obstacle and that was a fatal 
misreading of the situation tower writes in hindsight what 
lay before me however was not confirmation as secretary of 
defense but a political killing field prepared by the chairman of 
the senate armed services committee 
tower criticizes the ranking republican on the armed services 
committee sen john warner of virginia for failing to lead the 
fight for the presidents nominee 
to keep on good terms with sam nunn he ceded the rights of 
the republican minority to object to a course of action that was 
inimical to its best interests tower wrote 
warner who spoke on the senate floor on towers behalf during 
the confirmation fight was the lone senator to respond to the 
book 
youve got to know john tower as we do its his texas 
style warner said thursday 
towers attacks on exon as a heavy drinker are not new during 
exons reelection fight against republican hal daub in november 
tower campaigned for the gop candidate and made the same 
accusations exon denied the charges 
tower does not limit his criticisms to the senate the former 
senator believes that white house counsel c boyden grays 
inexperience in handling the nomination contributed in some ways to 
its demise

for mayor john landreth the fourth 
flood in 18 months really took the cake his 50th anniversary cake 
when we opened the banquet hall up on sunday there was a 
foot of water and the cake was floating on the floor said his 
wife mildred 
in addition to ruining the party at the legion hall the flood 
on piney creek caused 500000 in damage and forced more than 160 
people from their homes 
now landreth is ready to take on the army corps of engineers 
we dont need another study the mayor said tuesday we 
need the damn creek fixed take what money would be spent on the 
studies and get in there and do some corrective work 
the creek has been studied by the corps since 1957 when floods 
almost wiped the town out landreth said he witnessed his 
first flood in spring city 60 miles north of chattanooga in 1921 
at age 6 
the corps last year offered to do a free 18month preliminary 
study a comprehensive twoyear study and finally another 18month 
feasibility study on how to stop piney creek from flooding 
during a threeweek period starting in june 1989 the creek 
flooded three times and caused up to 225000 damage over the 
weekend more than three inches of rain pushed the creek over its 
banks and flooded the town of 2250 
we know what needs to be done we dont need somebody in 
washington or nashville sitting behind a desk looking at it on 
paper and telling us what needs to be done the mayor said 
but we didnt qualify for federal disaster assistance last 
time we got no federal help and very little state assistance 
the creek drains a 20000acre watershed and winds downstream 
with two sharp bends near city limits straightening the curves 
would be the quickest and easiest solution to the flooding problem 
landreth said 
the army corps of engineers was unavailable for comment because 
of the christmas holiday the corps has jurisdiction over flood 
control on many national waterways 
landreth said a group of businessmen and a city crew cleared 
another problem creek town creek last spring without a permit 
the creek stayed within its banks over the weekend 
a businessman wanted to clear out the bends in piney creek last 
spring and was encouraged to do the work out of sight the mayor 
said but the man was reported to the corps which halted the work 
he said 
the mayor met monday with a representative from gov ned 
mcwherters office 
if we cant get some cooperation from the corps this time 
and im going to ask the governor to intercede for us we are just 
going to get in there and do it anyway and work on it until we get 
stopped and hauled to jail landreth said 
we cant just keep sitting here waiting for the next flood

school suicideprevention programs for teenagers 
can do some youngsters more harm than good researchers said today 
columbia university researchers said they found little evidence 
that such programs reduced suicides or suicide attempts according 
to a study in todays journal of the american medical association 
there was some evidence of unwanted effects on teenagers 
who have attempted suicide researchers from columbias medical 
school 
discussing the topic openly often stirred up suicidal feelings 
subjects of the study said of those who had tried to kill 
themselves before taking part in school counseling 267 percent 
thought the programs increase the chances that youths will attempt 
suicide 
attempters exposed to programs were significantly less likely 
to recommend that the programs be presented to other students and 
significantly more likely to indicate that talking about suicide 
makes some kids more likely to try to kill themselves the study 
said 
there is a clear need to evaluate such programs to determine 
their efficacy and safety 
the team headed by david shaffer director of the division of 
child and adolescent psychiatry at the medical school studied the 
impact of prevention programs on the attitudes of students in the 
ninth and 10th grades who said they had tried to commit suicide 
the researchers found that those teenagers continued to believe 
suicide was a possible solution to their problems and that they 
would be less likely to seek help or discuss their feeling with 
peers who havent tried to kill themselves 
suicide is the third leading cause of death among people 15 to 
24 years old 
a psychiatrist not connected with the study said he was not 
surprised by the results 
you cant just get kids not to commit suicide by just 
educating them about the problem and telling them where to get 
help said dr jan fawcett chairman of the department of 
psychiatry at rush presbyterianst lukes hospital in chicago and 
an authority on suicides 
its not an intellectual exercise theres more to it than 
that 
the study evaluated the impact of schoolbased suicide 
prevention programs on 973 teenagers 63 of whom said they had 
tried to kill themselves 
the students were divided into two groups with 524 
participating in prevention programs including 35 suicide 
attempters the 449 others 28 of whom had tried to take their 
lives did not participate in the programs which were conducted 
by specially trained teachers 
the warning signs of young people at risk were described in the 
programs some of which lasted as long as three hours the programs 
were intended to raise awareness of teenage suicides and 
recommended counseling among participants who were surveyed about 
their attitudes before and after the programs 
researchers also concluded that the attitudes of suicide 
attempters who did not participate in the programs were not 
significantly more negative than those who did 
fawcett said prevention programs should treat suicide like an 
illness such as depression or stress which can be treated with 
the help of friends family and professionals 
the programs must be careful not to focus too heavily on suicide 
and should instead concentrate on the factors that often lead to 
it he said 
the problem is deromanticizing suicide fawcett said kids 
are very suggestible they see reports about suicide on television 
and may begin to see suicide as a way to end their troubles or make 
their parents feel bad they may not have a concept of death as a 
final consequence

people who think the modern chemicalsaturated 
environment is making them sick may simply be suffering mental 
problems a university of iowa research group says critics called 
their study naive and sloppy 
patients diagnosed with the syndrome known as environmental 
illness often get sick after exposure to everyday items like 
processed foods newsprint gasoline and clothing 
belief in the condition also called multiplechemical 
sensitivity varies in the medical community with some doctors 
doubting its existence altogether 
its my belief that people diagnosed as having environmental 
illnesses in most cases do have something wrong a garden variety 
emotional disorder said dr donald w black who headed a study 
at the universitys medical school published today in the journal 
of the american medicine association 
beginning in june 1988 blacks research team studied 23 people 
diagnosed as suffering from environmental illnesses fifteen or 65 
percent showed symptoms of past or present mental disorders like 
depression anxiety or obsessive compusive behavior the study 
said 
in a 46member control group of healthy people 13 or 28 
percent showed symptoms of mental disorders the study said 
the research was naively conceived and porly set up said dr 
leo galland a new york internist who treats people diagnosed with 
environmental illness 
comparing the mental conditions of environmental illness 
patients against healthy people rather than the mental states of 
people suffering medically accepted chronic ailments was a 
critical flaw galland said 
being sick tends to make people depressed he said i 
dont think theres ever been a study done comparing healthy 
community members with a group of patients who suffer from a 
chronic illness that hasnt found more psychopathology among the 
patient group 
comparing the mental conditions of environmental illness 
subjects with those of people with asthma for example might have 
proved his claim he said 
a group of medical practitioners called clinical ecologists 
believe that common chemicals in the air and physical environment 
can upset the bodys immune system leading to nausea respiratory 
problems headaches and other ailments the study said 
some patients have reported hypersensitivity to rugs paneling 
deodorant bedding and other everyday substances some sufferers 
have sought out toxic free environments by giving up their 
urban jobs and moving to the desert or mountains 
a lack of an acceptable definition for environmental illness as 
well as a lack of an established test for the disease has led much 
of the medical community to dismiss the concept the researchers 
wrote 
another critic said even if the iowa teams conclusions were 
valid toxins in the environment could have contributed to the 
mental disorders 
i dont think any psychiatrist can tell me what causes mental 
illnesses like depression and neurosis said dr max costa 
professor of environmental medicine and pharmacology at new york 
university medical school 
chemicals can enter the brain and produce toxic effects he 
said 
blacks research team also criticized the use of nonproven 
treatments on people diagnosed with environmental illness those 
treatments include special diets wearing filter masks and using 
douches or enemas of spring water coffee or yogurt 
the variety of treatments seems to be limited only by the 
imagination and resourcefulness of the clinician the doctors 
wrote 
the studys findings suggested that many victims of 
environmental illnesses turned to clinical ecologists because other 
doctors could not provide a reason for their symptoms researchers 
wrote 
the study subjects clearly believed that their clinical 
ecologists had something to offer them that others did not 
sympathy recognition of pain and suffering a physical explanation 
for their suffering and active participation in medical care

a government intelligence agency today 
announced the arrest of 31 students on charges of forming a north 
koreandirected organization that sought to overthrow the 
government 
the agency for national security planning also said more than 70 
other members of the group called chamintong were being sought 
chamintong is an acronym meaning independence democracy and 
unification 
in a statement the intelligence agency said chamintongs goal 
was to form a unified korea by 1995 under north korean leader kim 
il sungs leadership it said the organization would resort to 
armed fighting if necessary 
the agency said the 31 arrested were believed to be core members 
of chamintong which was formed in 1988 with guidance from a 
clandestine north korean propaganda outlet 
chamintong has about 800 members the agency said 
investigations found that chamintong has manipulated the 
chondaehyop a dissident student alliance to stage antigovernment 
and antiamerican activities in the name of seeking 
democratization it said 
chondaehyop has been involved in sometimes violent 
demonstrations demanding the pullout of american troops and 
overthrow of the seoul government in favor of unification with the 
north the agency said 
the 31 arrested included chondaehyop chairman song kapsuk 24 
a senior at chonnam university in kwangju who was arrested in 
october the agency did not say when the others were arrested 
the announcement said the agency seized 700 pieces of evidence 
including computer disks containing instructions received via north 
korean radio and printed materials containing chamintongs 
clandestine programs 
chamintong members pledged allegiance to kim il sung when they 
joined the revolutionary organization 
the intelligence agency statement urged a national campaign to 
crush the nations pronorth korean and communist rings which it 
said have about 10000 regular members overall and can mobilize up 
to 200000 followers anytime 
security forces have arrested about 100 radical student leaders 
in a crackdown that began in september when the two koreas agreed 
to open highlevel political talks 
the two koreas have held three rounds of prime ministers talks 
aimed at easing hostility since september but so far have failed to 
make any tangible progress because of mutual distrust 
north korea has consistently criticized the south for arresting 
dissidents and radical students who have made contact with or 
visited the north

a finding earlier this year that alcoholism may 
be caused by a single gene has come under question by government 
researchers 
the new study did not rule out the possibility that alcoholism 
is genetically caused at least in part but the study said the 
gene in question is probably not especially linked to the disease 
you can look at our data lots of different ways but you dont 
find support for the linkage said dr david goldman of the 
national institute on alcohol abuse and alcoholism 
a study published in april found the gene called the dopamine 
d2 receptor gene in 69 percent of severe alcoholics studied but 
in only 20 percent of the nonalcoholics 
goldmans research team found the gene present in 38 percent of 
the alcoholics studied and in 30 percent of people chosen at 
random casting doubt on the earlier report according to a study 
in todays journal of the american medical association 
a coleader of the earlier study said monday he stands by its 
findings 
we never said this particular gene form would be widespread in 
all of alcoholism were just talking about a group of very severe 
alcoholics dr kenneth blum said in a telephone interview monday 
from san antonio texas 
blum is chief of the addictive diseases division in the 
department of pharmacology at the university of texas health 
science center in san antonio 
he said the government study had several inadequacies failure 
to adequately define severe alcoholism failure to screen out 
possible alcoholics from the control subjects who were compared 
with alcoholics and exclusion of alcoholics who had active medical 
disorders including cirrhosis which afflicts many longtime 
alcoholics 
blums team studied genes from the brains of 35 alcoholics who 
had died compared them with genes from 35 nonalcoholic cadavers 
and reported the results in the april 18 journal of the american 
medical association 
he said his team had since confirmed its findings in genes of 50 
living alcoholic subjects 
though scientists in general have agreed for years that 
alcoholism is probably caused by both genetics and environment 
blums published report was the first to identify a particular gene 
as a possible culprit 
goldmans team studied genes of 40 living alcoholics and 127 
living people from a random population sample 
it is always possible that there is a subgroup of alcoholics 
out there who have this gene goldman said in a telephone 
interview monday from bethesda md 
but his teams study did not support a widespread or consistent 
association between the d2 receptor gene and alcoholism their 
report said 
the body contains an estimated 100000 genes each of which is 
reproduced identically in the nucleus of every cell and serves as 
part of a persons hereditary blueprint 
goldman declined to guess how many genes could be important 
identifiers of alcoholism 
the important thing that people should take home from this 
whole thing is not that theres not a genetics of alcoholism he 
said but that we still have a long way to go in exploring it

a womans body exhumed from a paupers grave 
earlier this month is not that of candy heiress helen brach missing 
since 1977 according to local authorities but a federal agency 
says the case is still open 
cook county medical examiner robert stein said that he a 
forensic ornithologist an anthropologist a radiologist and 
another medical examiner studied the body 
its definitely not helen brach stein said monday as far 
as were concerned the case is closed 
mrs brach heiress to the brach candy co fortune had an 
estimated net worth of 17 million when she disappeared in 1977 
after checking herself out of the mayo clinic in rochester minn 
she was 65 her estate is now valued at more than 50 million 
she was declared legally dead in 1984 most of her money went to 
the helen brach foundation a charitable trust 
an unidentified body was found in a suburban forest preserve in 
1978 stein ruled then that the body was not the missing heiress 
and it was buried 
but the federal bureau of alcohol tobacco and firearms 
developed information during a racketeering fraud investigation 
that led them to request a new examination of the body this year 
said atf spokesman jerry singer 
the body was exhumed dec 11 
the bureau still considers the case open and is awaiting results 
of forensic tests including dna before reaching any conclusions 
singer said 
we have to refrain from commenting because all the tests have 
not been finished and theres no timetable as to when the 
examinations will be completed singer said

the city has consistently awarded the nations 
most expensive school bus contracts without competitive bidding to 
companies linked to organizedcrime figures a newspaper reported 
today 
contractors and lawenforcement officials told the new york 
times that unions influenced by suspected organized crime figures 
control the costs and hiring practices of many of the bus companies 
the city employs 
one company that transported disabled children in brooklyn was 
run by a man who has admitted to being a mafia hit man the times 
said 
during the 198990 school year the city spent an average of 
1701 each to bus 136000 pupils of those 39000 are 
handicapped the rest do not live within walking distance of their 
schools 
according to the times 
robert bering who has admitted to participating in mafia 
murders obtained about 22 million in contracts 
julius bernstein an official in the amalgamated transit 
union local 11811061 which represents most of the citys 3000 
school bus drivers acknowledged in an interview that he had met 
with men identified as leaders in the gambino and genovese 
organizedcrime families he said the meetings were unrelated to 
union or school bus matters 
frank dapolito described by the fbi as a captain in the 
gambino family is the personnel manager for a group of companies 
that have 12 million in contracts this year 
edward lino another reputed gambino captain who was slain 
last month controlled a company that received 82 million in 
fees 
stanley litow deputy schools chancellor for operations said 
problems relating to mounting bus costs and organizedcrime 
influence were certainly disturbing 
he told the times that methods of awarding and supervising bus 
contracts were being reexamined 
local 1181 president john ambrosio disputed allegations that his 
union has driven up the cost of bus contracts 
we have not got a stranglehold ambrosio told the times 
we have stabilized the industry by putting every contractor on an 
even keel with the same contract terms 
largescale competitive bidding for school bus contracts has not 
occurred since 1979 the report said 
instead the school board renews existing contracts with 
costofbusiness increases new york city school officials said 
bidding is unpredictable 
the times said new york pays more per pupil than any other large 
district in the country and in many cases spends almost twice as 
much as nearby suburban school systems 
it reported los angeles had the second highest perpupil cost at 
1639 but that officials there said 70 percent of the buses are 
used for integration and that some round trips are up to 80 miles 
milwaukee with competitive bidding had the lowest big city 
cost at an average cost of 683 per pupil per year 
the lowest cost was 333 in fairfax county va which has its 
own fleet

albanian communists held a national 
conference today to debate radical changes in their hardline 
policies before elections in february when they will face 
opposition candidates for the first time 
more than 1000 delegates from local branches of ruling 
albanias labor party gathered behind closed doors at the 
parliamentary presidium in the center of the albanian capital 
tirana local journalists said 
during the oneday meeting delegates were to hear president and 
party chief ramiz alia propose reforms to the party platform the 
journalists said 
the reforms were to include opening up the flagging centralized 
economy removing restrictions on religion and improving human 
rights standards 
the feb 10 elections would be the first multiparty ballot since 
the communists took power in 1944 and plunged the balkan nation 
into decades of political and economic isolation 
alia reversed 46 years of hardline policy earlier this month by 
allowing the creation of noncommunist political organizations the 
move came after student protests over slumlike dormitories led to 
riots and fullblown demands for democracy in europes last bastion 
of stalinism 
gramoz pashko a founder of albanias newly formed opposition 
democratic party said the communists were trying to win support 
and stay in power by promising reform but he said even sweeping 
changes within the labor party could not reverse the harm done by 
decades of communist rule 
if the people support the communists they will do even more 
damage to the country and to themselves he said in a telephone 
interview from tirana 
but he added the opposition would welcome us diplomatic 
relations with tirana as soon as possible given the new 
realities in albania 
the united states and all western governments should have ties 
so they can press the government to make political pluralism real 
not just on paper he said 
pashko said the democratic party would continue pressing the 
government for a postponement of the elections to allow the 
opposition more time to prepare an effective campaign communist 
authorities on monday rejected the opposition calls for a 
postponement 
alia was expected to propose a new radical platform that 
will take a critical stance toward the past and try and open up for 
the future shkelqim beqari a journalist at the labor party 
daily zeri i popullit said in a telephone interview from tirana 
he said the delegates would then debate how the party should 
campaign for the elections 
the first opposition party the democratic party was legalized 
within days and is planning to contest the elections but although 
statues of the late soviet dictator have been removed across the 
country as alia moves cautiously toward reform the communists 
still control virtually every sphere of public life making 
effective opposition difficult 
more than 200 of the hundreds arrested in the rioting were tried 
and at least one of more than a dozen people sentenced was given a 
20year prison term some others received 15 years 
the government on monday rejected the new partys request to 
postpone the elections for several months to allow it more time to 
prepare a campaign

about 30 people were killed 
the court in fez postponed until jan 8 the trials of 33 other 
people on that date it will also continue the trial of mohamed 
titna alaoui head of the fez branch of the general moroccan 
workers union which along with the democratic work confederation 
called the general strike 
a tanger court on friday sentenced 28 people to three to 
fivemonth prison terms and a court in sidikacem sentenced nine 
people to oneyear terms 
in rabat two opposition parties istiqlal and the socialist 
union of popular forces demanded the government publish the 
identities of those hurt and killed in the violence and the names 
of foreign powers the government has claimed were interfering in 
the unrest 
the moroccan government meanwhile continued this week its 
negotiations with unions and employers on priority measures 
promised after the disturbances the official map news agency 
reported among the measures under consideration are increases in 
minimum wages and in social allocations

assembly until elections can be held 
surinamese stayed home from work today a regularly scheduled 
national holiday their only information on the coup came from 
radio and television broadcasts newspapers do not publish on 
christmas day or the day after 
leo morpurgo editor of the morning daily de ware tyd said 
there were no apparent restrictions on the press or on civil rights 
following the bloodless coup in this georgiasized nation on south 
americas northeastern coast 
in a christmas day radio address the acting army chief said the 
military regime would set up an interim government hold elections 
within 100 days and relinquish power 
the army is not bent on having and keeping power said cmdr 
ivan graanoogst who heads the military police and is no 2 in the 
military chainofcommand he said a nonpolitical government 
cabinet would be appointed within a week 
the united states and dutch governments condemned the christmas 
eve coup in the former dutch colony that toppled the 3yearold 
elected government of president ramsewak shankar 
the coups mastermind was thought to be cmdr desi bouterse who 
resigned as army chief just hours before shankar was toppled 
bouterse and shankar had been engaged in a long and bitter dispute 
bouterse has not been seen or made any public statements since 
the coup he ruled this nation of 400000 people for eight years after 
seizing power in a 1980 military coup and has wielded considerable 
power behind the scenes since shankars government was elected by a 
landslide in november 1987 
appearing on television tuesday night army spokesman hubert 
eersel said the army would adhere to five principles 
he said the army would be guided by the constitution approved 
in a plesbiscite in october 1987 recognize the national assembly 
and seek the legislative bodys guidance on economic matters 
he said the democratic and constitutional state will be the 
guiding principle for all proceedings and that all treaties 
signed since independence from the netherlands in 1975 will be 
respected fully 
it was not immediately clear how the coup might affect an 
insurgency that has crippled the mining of bauxite a major export 
used in producing aluminum a peace agreement between guerrillas 
and the ousted government was opposed by the army 
in washington state department spokeswoman sondra mccarty urged 
restoration of the civilian government 
we condemn this violation of constitutional order in 
suriname she said we call on the surinamese military to 
restore power immediately to the democratically elected authorities 
of that country 
the dutch foreign ministry said it sharply condemns the 
undemocratic seizure of power by the surinamese army 
the military notified the government that it was taking control 
while shankar and his cabinet met late monday night in emergency 
session at the presidential palace according to a government 
official 
the official said the president and the other officials decided 
to go home and offer no resistance thereby avoiding bloodshed 
not a single shot was fired the official said on condition of 
anonymity 
reached by telephone tuesday at his home shankar said he and 
his ministers were not under house arrest and had complete freedom 
of movement 
im free to go wherever i want to he said 
bouterse in his resignation statement cited differences with 
shankar whom he described as a joker 
the final straw bouterse indicated was shankars alleged 
failure to intervene when dutch authorities denied the military 
leader visas and refused to allow him to be interviewed by 
reporters on three separate stopovers in the netherlands this 
month 
bouterse announced his resignation saturday on his return from 
his latest trip to ghana and switzerland 
bouterse and shankar however have been at odds ever since the 
1987 election in which shankars threeparty coalition the front 
for democracy and development easily defeated the militarybacked 
national democracy party 
the military leader bitterly opposes the governments attempt to 
negotiate settlement of a costly insurgency by surinames bush 
negro minority who seek better living conditions 
bouterses former bodyguard ronny brunswijk launched the 
guerrilla war in july 1986 that closed bauxite mines in the eastern 
part of the country

king michael romanias former monarch returned 
to his swiss exile today after being expelled by the bucharest 
government less than 12 hours after he had arrived o a surprise 
visit his first in four decades 
the 69yearold former king returned to romania exactly a year 
after the execution of communist dictator nicolae ceausescu in a 
popular revolution the monarch had been forced into exile with the 
communist takeover 43 years ago 
the romanian government already facing mounting strikes and 
protests by an opposition that accuses it of being a communist 
regime in disguise apparently feared the visit by michael might 
stir up unrest it unceremoniously threw him out on the ground that 
he had not secured permission to visit 
after ceausescu was overthrown the former king had announced 
himself ready to return from exile as head of a constitutional 
monarchy if my people want me to come back 
the national salvation front which took power during last 
years revolution in romania and won subsequent elections extended 
no invitation for him to visit and had refused to grant him a 
visa 
in june the former king accused the front of leading the 
country back toward communist dictatorship 
before being put on a romanianchartered flight to switzerland 
this morning michael termed his expulsion a rather sorry state 
of affairs 
the plane carrying the former monarch and a small entourage 
landed at zurich airport today airport officials said the king 
was traveling by connecting flight to geneva where he lives 
michael had arrived on tuesday night at bucharests otopeni 
airport on his private plane from switzerland 
he was accompanied by his wife ana de bourbonparme his 
daughter sophie and several journalists and aides they were met 
by another daughter margarita who was already in romania on a 
visit 
michael was to have attended a mass there today and leave 
romania tonight 
but soon after the group arrived the interior ministry issued a 
statement saying the three family members had arrived without visas 
and crossed the border fraudulently 
sophie insisted that michael had received a visa 
my father received a visa just like this one she said 
displaying her passport with a separate stamped visa document she 
said officials had taken her fathers danish diplomatic passport 
michael also said he had a visa 
danielle maillefer a spokeswoman for michael said premier 
petre roman had strongly advised him not to come but did not 
give a firm yes or no 
she said michael felt he has a role to play in romania and 
so decided to ignore romans advice 
the former king who is of the house of 
hohenzollernsigmaringen ruled romania twice for short periods he 
first succeeded his grandfather ferdinand in 1927 as michael i 
after his father carol left the country 
after returning in 1930 carol acceded to the throne and ruled 
for 10 years michael was then crowned again and reigned until he 
was forced to abdicate when the communists took power in 1947 he 
later declared the abdication invalid 
during world war ii he ruled briefly under gen ion antonescu 
who was allied with the axis led by nazi germany michael is seen 
as important in the 1944 coup that removed antonescu allowing 
romania to change sides and support the allies 
he helped install a government with a token communist presence 
the communists rigged elections in 1947 and forced michael to 
abdicate

grenade for crowd control said a us navy spokesman cmdr

the vessel en route to the iraqi port of basra carried 800

island the ship was secured and escorted to a nearby 
anchorage he said 
neuhart said the trouble started when the sailors approached the 
pilot house of the freighter and a number of the crew attempted 
to hold the boarding party members back and grab their weapons 
he said members of a female peace delegation aboard the ship 
which included americans also joined in the fracas but that 
neither the crew nor the women used weapons against the boarding 
party 
he said that in the fracas one of our guys was knocked over 
by one of the women 
the iraqi shipmaster claimed that there were two heart attacks 
and two miscarriages because of the boardings but a us navy 
medical officer found the claims unfounded neuhart said

did not require medical evacuation and there were no injuries 
said neuhart

three jewish west bank settlers were freed from 
prison today after serving less than seven years of a life term for 
killing three palestinian students and maiming two west bank mayors 
in the early 1980s 
scores of chanting and dancing settlers carried the three on 
their shoulders out of maasiyahu prison in the central israeli town 
of ramle 
dozens of israeli jurists and lawmakers outside the prison 
protested the release saying it will encourage jewish extremism 
in the occupied gaza strip meanwhile troops shot and killed a 
palestinian today after he stabbed three soldiers patrolling the 
shati refugee camp the army said 
palestinian reports identified the slain man as ala abdullatif 
obeid 30 from shati doctors at gazas shifa hospital said he was 
shot at least 30 times 
his death brought to 780 the number of palestinians killed by 
israelis during the 3yearold uprising against the occupation of 
the west bank and gaza strip another 322 palestinians have been 
slain by fellow arabs most on suspicion of helping israel 
fiftyseven israelis also died in the violence 
two of soldiers who were stabbed were in fair condition at tel 
hashomer hospital in tel aviv and the third was treated for a minor 
wound at soroka hospital in beersheva the army spokesmans office 
said 
the three settlers freed today were the last of a 28member cell 
called the jewish underground to be released from prison 
the group carried out bombings and attacks aimed at palestinian 
officials mosques and the islamic college in the occupied west 
bank 
menahem livni the leader of the group who as released today 
said he was not sorry for what he did though officials who reduced 
the sentences had said the three settlers expressed remorse 
the use of the word regret in this case is childish livni 
told israel radio after he left prison with the two other convicted 
settlers shaul nir and uzi sharbav 
livni and other settler leaders claimed the group was pushed to 
violence because the government didnt crack down hard enough on 
palestinian militants 
there is a grave shortcoming in the way the government is 
dealing with arab terror this shortcoming has persisted for 10 
years livni said 
in israel a life sentence usually means the inmate must serve 
at least 20 years there is no death penalty except for nazi war 
crimes 
president chaim herzog reduced the sentences of the three men to 
10 years in 1989 after being convinced that the three had 
expressed unambiguous and honest regrets the presidents 
spokesman said at the time 
two weeks ago a parole committee cut the terms by another third 
for good behavior 
this is a message of contempt for human life of making a 
difference between one type of life and another and it violates 
the basic tenet of equality before the law said yitzhak zamir a 
former israeli attorney general protesting outside the prison 
the three settlers released today had been jailed since they 
were arrested in april 1984 all three were convicted in july 1985 
livni was convicted of masterminding three june 1980 car 
bombings that maimed two west bank mayors bassam shaka of nablus 
and karim halaf of ramallah and blinded an israeli police 
explosives expert 
shaka wheelchairbound after losing his legs in the explosion 
said the early release was part of israeli government policy to 
encourage extremists to act against palestinians 
nir and sharbav were found guilty of breaking into the islamic 
college in the west bank town of hebron in july 1983 throwing a 
hand grenade and firing wildly three students were killed and 30 
wounded in the attack 
livni who planned the attack on the college said the victims 
were not innocent 
the islamic college is a hornets nest of terror and there is 
nonstop incitement there livni said 
the jewish underground was also blamed for unsuccessful 
attempts to plant bombs on five arab buses in east jerusalem and to 
blow up the dome of the rock one of islams holiest monuments

here are excerpts from recent editorials in newspapers in the 
united states and abroad 
 
dec 23 
the oregonian portland ore on the soviet union 
soviet foreign minister eduard a shevardnadzes surprising 
resignation is a tremendous shock to the west on two counts it 
potentially takes a westernlooking and trusted negotiator from a 
key position shevardnadzes reason a reactionary trend toward 
dictatorship shows how uncertain the soviet unions future 
including its relationship with the west really is 
shevardnadze has been a key associate of soviet president 
mikhail gorbachev and that team has been a good one from the 
western perspective the international result has been breathtaking 
the effective release of eastern europe from the soviet grip and 
the breakup of the warsaw pact as a military force 
within the soviet union however the situation is chaotic a 
political revolution of rising expectations has unleashed yearnings 
for independence among various soviet republics 
the food supply and other economic indicators have gotten worse 
many are calling for forcible imposition of central control 
its no surprise that such disorder brings cries for order at 
any cost but shevardnadzes warning is as chilling for the west as 
for the soviet congress that he issued it to dictatorship is 
coming i say this with all responsibility nobody knows what kind 
of dictatorship it will be and who will come what kind of 
dictator and what kind of system 
from the western perspective the hope is that reform doesnt 
break down in the soviet union the reactionaries shevardnadze 
warned against are likely to hold the old brooding russian view of 
the world particularly the west as a threat and never to be 
trusted 
the best policy for the west is one of benign noninterference 
to show we are ready to be friends with whatever manifestation the 
soviet union takes if it is equally ready 
we can hope for reform but must be ready to work with whatever 
results 
 
dec 24 
the birmingham ala news on the soviet union 
shevardnadzes resignation on principle certainly is 
something we havent seen much of here in the west from soviet 
political leaders in the past those moves took place behind the 
kremlins dark walls 
and shevardnadzes warning that if a dictatorship is created 
theres no guaranteeing who the next dictator will be must be 
considered 
but its clearly a warning more for gorbachev and the soviet 
people to consider than for us weve seen soviet dictators before 
our way is clear 
we must maintain a strong military force we have to keep the 
nato alliance viable arms reduction talks must continue but our 
negotiators should be as diligent as ever in assuring that any 
agreement reached is verifiable and enforceable 
and while we might prefer dealing with gorbachev and our 
interests may best be served if he remains the soviet leader we 
cant bank solely on him 
if shevardnadze was trying to tell us anything by his abrupt 
resignation that probably was it 
 
dec 23 
the providence ri journalbulletin on the soviet union 
for a year now everybody has been celebrating the end of the 
cold war recent events in the soviet union however might make us 
more comfortable with the word truce as disturbing as it is 
eduard shevardnadzes resignation as soviet foreign minister at 
least concentrates the attention of everyone east and west on the 
seriousness of the crisis in the soviet union 
does mikhail gorbachev really stand on the side of democracy and 
openness and how far is he willing to go to fight for these 
principles his enemies are at the gates perhaps within them and 
he cant dither too much longer before casting his lot 
the lesson for the west that we should not tie our plans too 
closely to individual leaders in a place as unpredictable as the 
soviet union and we should not necessarily expect the more benign 
regime of the recent past to continue 
it is worrying that powerful forces have expressed 
everincreasing resentment about the soviets declining world 
influence about the loss of control of eastern europe and so on 
the soviets will still be in a position to threaten the west if new 
leaders should decide to act on these resentments

san francisco chronicle on the persian gulf 
generals have been known to fire from the verbal hip sometimes 
with a naive insouciance about just what it is they are saying 
and their words potential consequences 
in the case of lieutenant general calvin waller however this 
deputy commander of american forces in the gulf was simply being 
candid about what many have already intimated american troops are 
not yet at peak strength and efficiency for what may be an 
extremely difficult desert operation 
his words take some of the pressure off january 15 that looming 
date on which seemingly saddam would retreat or we would attack 
generals may be isolated but they sense the hazards of war more 
acutely than diplomats 
let the attack come if it must when we are ready

beacon journal akron ohio on minority scholarships 
the bush administrations partial retreat from its assault 
against college scholarships for blacks and other minorities was 
wise but it did not go far enough 
in shifting gears rapidly and with clear nudges from an 
embarrassed white house michael l williams assistant secretary 
for civil rights in the us department of education left standing 
at least part of his original and unfortunate ban on scholarships 
designated for minorities 
in retreating however williams said colleges could award such 
scholarships without penalty as long as the money came from private 
donations or federal funds designed to aid minority students he 
then said colleges would not be allowed to use money from their 
general operating budgets for scholarships based on race 
how such a farreaching policy could have been set in motion 
without presidential knowledge defies understanding why it was not 
totally reversed is now even more of a mystery especially since 
bush made it clear ive long been committed to such 
scholarships

the repository canton ohio on the war on drugs 
lets not get too excited about those government figures that 
show a drop in the use of cocaine over the last five years lets 
just be cautiously optimistic 
health and human services secretary louis sullivan said the 
latest figures show some progress in the effort to change attitudes 
and drug habits and president bush said the statistics demonstrate 
that our hard work is paying off 
maybe so but were a long way from being out of the woods the 
statistics also reflect the fact that many adolescents are 
experimenting with drugs and the number of people who use cocaine 
daily has increased since 1988 
this means the nation has a long way to go before anyone can 
declare that the drug menace is under control we all must keep 
fighting

the presscourier oxnard calif on commercial banks 
contrary to the chicken little scenarios gaining currency on 
capitol hill the banking industry is not about to go the way of 
the beleaguered savingsandloan system 
for starters banks have been more tightly regulated than the 
thrifts that stricter oversight is one reason banks made 26 
billion last year while the sampl industry lost 19 billion 
many thrifts disintegrated during a period when the government 
gave them a free hand to make risky investments under the cover of 
federally guaranteed deposit insurance banks always have been 
subject to much stricter government control 
in addition many failed sampls were undercapitalized and thus 
vulnerable to looting by larcenous managers as publicly held 
corporations major banks are required to open their books to 
public scrutiny so such abuses are much easier to detect promptly 
despite several weak years the banking industry is still 
capable of regaining its financial health with a timely assist from 
congress

chicago tribune on the elections in haiti 
last weeks elections in haiti were praiseworthy for what didnt 
happen as well as for what did unlike in 1987 when 37 people died 
in election day violence at the hands of thugs believed backed by 
the army the military this time provided security at the polls 
rather than trying to subvert the democratic process 
voting was generally peaceful as 70 percent of registered 
haitians turned out to elect rev jeanbertrand aristide a priest 
who advocates liberation theology by a sizeable majority 
aristide appealed to the young and the poor by stressing 
selfreliance social justice economic reform and the elimination 
of corruption in a country where annual per capita income is under 
400 the poor are the constituency to champion from now on 
though it will be the powerholders the military business 
leaders landowners who can be expected to watch the 
priestpresidents every move looking for missteps to exploit for 
their selfish ends

the commercial appeal memphis tenn on the messiness of 
democracy 
watching former dictatorships hold elections you realize what 
inexperience with freedom means what looks to a hardened westerner 
like the normal roughandtumble of a campaign may shock and 
mortify a pole 
in any event slander charges have been brought against 
stanislaw tyminski defeated in polands recent presidential race 
a curious upstart candidate who returned from 22 years in canada 
and peru to run from president tyminski got the worlds attention 
by outpolling the prime minister in the first round but then he 
lost by a big margin to lech walesa two weeks later after a bitter 
campaign 
tyminski enraged poles with his communist connections shady 
past and fierce attacks on the prime minister and walesa one 
local prosecutor overreacted however when the candidate falsely 
accused the government of selling off state property too cheaply 
if convicted of insulting the polish state tyminski could go to 
prison for six months to eight years 
one sympathizes with the wish that democratic politics could 
always be scrupulously fair campaigns always clean but veterans 
of democracy know better 
they know too that the way to counter a candidates lies is by 
exposing them publicly not by trotting out the very law the old 
communist government used to silence dissidents or anyone else it 
wanted to punish

the daily telegraph london on the soviet union 
the resignation of eduard shevardnadze provides dramatic 
confirmation of what the outside world has suspected fr months 
that the soviet union is teetering on the brink of dictatorship 
the enormous authority which parliament has handed to mr 
gorbachev his own prevarication over radical changes and his 
frequent references to the importance of law and order suggest that 
he is prepared to halt or even reverse internal reform for the 
sake of holding the country together 
 
dec 21 
the independent london on the soviet union 
the lights are going out in the soviet union the resignation of 
mr eduard shevardnadze is the despairing gesture of a sincere and 
exhausted man who does not want to be associated with the journey 
into darkness because he has supported reform so fully he takes 
with him a large portion of mr gorbachevs credibility he will 
also be a loss to his country in other ways for he played a 
central role in its opening to the world and its rapprochement with 
the west

the sunday telegraph london on the soviet union 
much western piety surrounds western fears of soviet 
dictatorship doubtless it would be bad in comparison with 
western democracy and a free market but gorbachev seems incapable 
of creating that happy combination the democracy he has produced 
is it seems a drag on the free market 
instead of accepting the necessity for unemployment straight 
away as mrs thatcher did when she started reforming the british 
economy in the early eighties mr gorbachev encouraged people in 
the name of democracy to express dissent if they thought he was 
doing things wrongly those with vested interest in the existing 
order slowed him down the soviet union now has the blessings of 
political freedom but not the blessings of economic freedom 
a dictatorship might well be secure enough to withdraw 
guaranteed employment and thus force workers to emerge from their 
ageold sloth it could break up the collective farms and parcel 
them out among private owners just as those earlier dictators the 
first bolsheviks did the opposite farmers would then have the 
incentive to produce food for the city shops 
democracy and the free market are not dependent on each other 
that they exist together in the west is because of something akin 
to an evolutionary miracle asian countries with free markets have 
become rich without much democracy britain herself was the richest 
country in the world long before most of her people had the vote 
naturally we in the west fear a new soviet dictatorship because 
we fear it might revive the soviet military threat to us that is 
the only good reason for fearing it we should not continue 
sentimentally to suggest that mr gorbachevs freedoms and mr 
gorbachev himself are essential to the wellbeing of the soviet 
people

the times london on the persian gulf crisis 
the gulf confrontation has revived the spirit in which the 
united nations was conceived a force for world order through which 
the civilized nations could join to counter aggression notably 
aggression against small states that many arab and third world 
nations have aligned themselves with this vision of a new world 
order is as significant as the unity between the superpowers 
what has emerged in the past six months is the possibility of a 
total realignment in the vast military might built up during the 
cold war a realignment in the cause not of regional selfdefense 
but of world order the world illserves itself by criticising the 
pain through which the united states is now passing as it debates 
its inevitably dominant role in this order 
american power for all its inadequacies its hesitations its 
ineptitudes remains unquestionably the best hope that civilized 
standards will triumph a high price may yet be extracted the gulf 
may erupt and swiftly give the lie to too much christmas optimism 
but war has never been a painless route to a greater peace the 
year fast closing has shown a glimpse of that peace and marked out 
the route there have been few more hopeful years than 1990

straits times singapore on cambodia 
the irony might as yet turn against hanoi and its phnom penh 
satellite it is not they but the battle hardened and logistically 
strong khmer rouge that can gain most from a breakdown of the peace 
process 
without a return of more vietnamese troops to cambodia or the 
even more unlikely arrival of other sympathetic foreign forces 
the phnom penh regime is no position to deal with the khmer rouge 
militarily 
it would appear to be in the interests of all concerned 
therefore for vietnam and its lackeys to try and make a success of 
the talks on cambodia opening in paris this week 
using sovereignty as a wedge against peace is not only 
unsustainable but might prove to be counterproductive if there 
is no peace what cambodia will have is not sovereignty but war 
the khmer rouge has never been known to find that preference 
distasteful

an israeli newspaper reported today that 
secretary of state james a baker iii will likely meet saddam 
hussein in baghdad for talks on jan 9 but a us official said no 
date for any negotiations had been set 
the independent daily maariv attributed the report to accounts 
reaching jerusalem from israeli diplomats based ontheir talks 
with us colleagues 
but in washington state department spokeswoman sondra mccarty 
said there was no such agreement on talks aimed at resolving the 
persian gulf crisis 
our embassy in baghdad is in almost daily contact with the 
iraqi foreign ministry there has been no iraqi movement on the 
question of dates she said she declined to elaborate 
israels foreign ministry said it had no information on any 
meeting between baker and the iraqi president prime minister 
yitzhak shamirs spokesman avi pazner also said he had no 
knowledge of such a proposal 
ruth yaron spokeswoman for the israeli embassy in washington 
also said we have no knowledge of anything of the sort she 
called the newspaper report pure speculation 
maariv said the meeting was set amid apparent secret 
negotiations between the united states and iraq 
the iraqi president has said for months that any resolution of 
the gulf crisis should be linked to a settlement of the 
israelipalestinian conflict saddam has recalled his ambassadors 
from the united states the united nations and several western 
european nations in past days giving rise to speculation that a 
new diplomatic initiative was in the works 
the paper said senior officials in washington told israeli 
representatives that baker would agree to visit baghdad on jan 9 
despite its proximity to the jan 15 united nations ultimatum for 
an iraqi troop pullout from kuwait 
saddam has previously offered to receive baker in baghdad on 
jan 12 but the white house has rejected that date as being too 
late it has said any date after jan 3 would not be acceptable 
saddam is also said to be demanding that the un security 
council pass a resolution linking iraqi withdrawal from kuwait to a 
settlement of the palestinian issue the israeli newspaper hadashot 
quoted the jordanian daily al shaab as saying saddam would announce 
such a plan in the next few days 
the united states and israel both have opposed any linkage 
between the iraqs aug 2 seizure of kuwait and israels 23year 
occupation of the west bank and gaza strip 
maariv said a jan 9 bakersaddam meeting could be linked to 
plans by a top aide to baker dennis ross to visit israel on jan 
7 to discuss new middle east peace proposals 
the foreign ministry spokesman said ross was expected to come to 
israel on jan 7 or 9 
the state department appears to be putting together a proposal 
for opening peace talks between israel and arab countries in tandem 
with holding municipal elections for 17 million palestinians in 
the occupied territories maariv said 
maariv also reported military movement along israels border 
with jordan and israels chief of staff lt gen dan shomron 
warned iraq may try to use jordan as a springboard for action 
against israel 
shomron said in a statement broadcast on israeli radio stations 
that jordan was liable to find itself despite its will or that 
of its leaders caught up in iraqi moves 
an army spokesman declined comment on the reported military 
moves along the jordan frontier the military routinely refuses 
comment on reports of military maneuvers 
the spokesman whose name cannot be used under army regulations 
added there was no change in the armys level of alert since a 
heightened preparedness was declared at the outset of the gulf 
crisis

shopkeepers across the country looked for bargainhunting buyers 
today hoping to clear out slowmoving holiday merchandise that 
made this a lackluster season 
today is traditionally one of the busiest shopping days of the 
year as hordes descend to return gifts and comb aisles for 
afterchristmas deals 
generally i think retailers would be quite pleased if their 
sales matched what they were a year ago said david a 
williamson a retail analyst for the advest group inc an 
investment research company in hartford conn 
profits will be at least 10 percent below a year ago he 
said today 
consumers were very tight with their dollars williamson 
said retailers had to be very promotional just to get customers 
into the stores let alone buy stuff 
prospects for a reversal of the lackluster holiday shopping 
season were slight with much of the country mired in economic 
recession but buyers who take advantage of steep markdowns on 
christmas cards decorations and wrapping paper might help ease 
storekeepers pain somewhat 
prechristmas sales were hurt by the economic slowdown 
especially in the northeast and fears of possible harder times if 
war breaks out in the persian gulf analysts said 
were slightly below expectations said matthew howard 
senior vice president for marketing at sears roebuck and co the 
nations largest retail store chain 
a surge in the three days before christmas helped he said 
monday other highprofile retailers also reported an 11thhour 
jump in sales but the extra business wasnt considered enough to 
turn the season around 
retailers traditionally count on christmas sales for up to half 
of yearly receipts

the line was short wednesday as a bitter wind 
whipped around the mao tsetung memorial hall where the late 
revolutionarys body lies under glass 
even on maos 97th birthday few ordinary chinese seem 
interested in remembering their former leader who died 14 years 
ago 
when they do remember its not always with respect 
theres a joke that says senior leader deng xiaoping seeking 
advice telephoned the late premier chou enlai in heaven and mao 
in hell when deng got the bill there was a huge charge for the 
longdistance call to heaven but no charge for calling mao 
local calls are free the operator explained 
other jokes make fun of maos infatuation in the 1930s with 
movie actress jiang qing for whom he divorced his wife he married 
jiang who became the screeching violenceinciting policewoman of 
the arts during the 196676 leftist cultural revolution 
the cultural revolution remains the main blight on maos image 
as leader of the communist struggle against imperialism and founder 
of what is officially called new china 
during the reformist 1980s maos heirs in power were too busy 
dismantling his farming communes and rebuilding the legal 
structures he destroyed to spend much time commemorating him 
but since the party was challenged by huge prodemocracy 
protests last year mao has made a bit of a comeback in official 
circles 
activities to mark the birthday were more numerous than in 
recent years and included performances of maos poetry set to 
music and scholarly forums on mao thought 
the peoples daily said a new book was published compiling 
remarks by mao that could apply to the recent collapse of socialism 
in other countries reflecting the partys position that his ideas 
remain a living relevant force 
at the mao memorial in tiananmen square however there was 
nothing to mark the day as different from any other 
line up four across a museum guard barked at chinese 
visitors most speaking in outoftown accents who waited to enter 
at midmorning they filed through in groups of about 50 one group 
every five minutes or so many ignoring the sign at the door that 
said please take off your hat 
guards allowed visitors little time to pay respects to mao who 
lies under a national flag in a glass coffin only his face 
preternaturally pink and shiny is exposed visitors were ushered 
along the sides of the room separated from the coffin by at least 
10 feet and by large clear plastic partitions 
memorial officials said attendance for the day was about 17000 
but the figure seemed exaggerated souvenir vendors outside 
selling plastic thermometers bearing maos picture and mao tsetung 
memorial hall chopstick sets say daily attendance is generally 
under 5000 
the memorial was closed for most of 1989 ostensibly so the 
building could be repaired however a westerner who first saw 
maos body several years ago said it appeared some touchup work 
also was done on the body 
officials said maos one surviving son one of two daughters and 
three grandchildren visited the memorial and brought flower 
wreaths as they do each year ordinary visitors were not allowed 
to see the family who are rarely mentioned in the official media 
it was not known if maos widow jiang now 74 and believed 
still in prison marked the day in any way 
filming recently began in beijing of yet another movie about 
mao following several similar warera epics last year the new 
movie about the death of a son in the korean war will try to show 
a new side of the stern leader his human face and love for his 
family the studio said 
a scene shot in the ballroom of the historic beijing hotel 
showed mao and several dozen aides all in their 50s and 60s 
foxtrotting with a host of pigtailed teenage girls jiang was not 
shown

senior leader deng xiaoping made his first public 
appearance since july voting in citywide elections in the capital 
on wednesday the 86yearold leader widely believed to be 
suffering from cancer appeared frail 
deng was shown on state television moving steadily but a bit 
shakily up to the voter registration table where he sat down to 
sign his name his daughter held his arm as he walked to the ballot 
box and dropped his ballot in 
however the official xinhua news agency described deng as 
walking vigorously to the polling station inside zhongnanhai the 
communist partys vast redwalled compound in central beijing 
with a beaming smile on his face deng received a voting slip 
from a young election worker after showing his electors card 
xinhua said 
deng had not made a confirmed appearance in public since july 
when he visited the asian games village a japanese newspaper 
recently reported that a tourist saw deng and president yang 
shangkun eating dinner in a public restaurant but there was no 
official confirmation 
since the last sighting of deng rumors had circulated that he 
was on his deathbed as happens whenever he is long absent 
although deng retired nearly a year ago from his last official 
post there is fear that his death will leave a power vacuum with 
no single leader strong enough to hold together competing 
ideological and regional factions 
some western diplomats however say to a certain extent that 
has already happened deng lost prestige as a result of the 
democracy movement in 1989 and its bloody quashing by the army and 
hardliners reportedly have criticized him directly in 
behindthescenes debates over chinas future course 
the party leadership has been unable to agree even on a new 
economic blueprint for the next five years suggesting that deng is 
no longer playing policymaker and power broker as he had since 
1978 chinese sources said the party finally opened a longdelayed 
central committee meeting on tuesday to discuss the fiveyear plan 
but that deep divisions remained 
several recent articles in the official media have summed up 
dengs achievements completely in the past tense as if he no 
longer were contributing to the party 
the television news also showed premier li peng communist party 
general secretary jiang zemin and other top leaders casting their 
ballots in zhongnanhai 
the election was for delegates to district and county peoples 
congresses chinas lowestlevel representative bodies and the only 
offices directly elected by the public 
the congresses have no legislative power and act mainly as 
conduits for citizens ideas and complaints but they are the basis 
for chinas assertion that it has a democratic system beijing has 
18 such congresses with a total of nearly 17000 delegates 
given chinas oneparty system the campaign was a placid 
affair with no debates or candidate advertisements and little 
contact between candidates and voters nominations are made chiefly 
by closeddoor committees and candidates must have good ideological 
credentials 
the law permits at most two candidates per seat but in practice 
the ratio is generally lower in the zhongnanhai district for 
example xinhua said deng and other voters were to choose two of 
three candidates 
ballots were to be counted by hand with results taking several 
days to tabulate

the worlds top auction houses have set up shop in 
berlin seeking to acquire and sell treasures kept hidden during 
communist rule in eastern euope 
sothebys the worlds largest art auction house has chosen a 
former prussian palace in eastern berlin as the site of its new 
office the previous tenant was the germansoviet friendship 
society 
rival christies has selected a posh groundfloor setting just 
off the kurfuerstendamm western berlins most fashionable shopping 
boulevard 
the arrival of the two major auction houses could signal the 
start of a revival of berlins prewar role as germanys major art 
center 
both aim to explore the art world of the formerly communist 
east largely closed off to capitalist dealers durin the cold war 
sothebys had long thought about going to berlin with the 
opening of the wall it became necessary to open said h josef 
koenig director of the berlin office 
koenig says he gets offers every day from eastern germans 
seeking appraisals of silver paintings or antiques they had 
hidden for years 
the objects include old meissen porcelain pieces of biedermeier 
furniture silver jewelry and paintings sometimes works of real 
value appear and can make their owners rich 
shortly before unity on oct 3 an east german from dresden 
showed up at the frankfurt branch of sothebys with a painting he 
had inherited the retired worker had hidden the painting after the 
1945 red army invasion and kept it secret from east german 
authorities who had forbidden private ownership of art 
experts identified the painting as a portrait by the 
20thcentury german expressionist emil nolde the work out of 
sight for half a century had been given up for lost by art 
connoisseurs it was valued at 900000 
nobody knows what is over there said koenig 
to find out christies hired peter betthausen former director 
of the national gallery in what was east berlin and a specialist in 
german art of the 19th and 20th centuries to head its office 
christies is also staffing its berlin office with experts to 
assess the value of objects offered focusing on silver and 
jewelry 
sothebys eastern expansion does not stop in berlin it already 
has an office in budapest and another is planned for prague in 
1991 
berlin was an art center in 1933 when nazi leader adolf hitler 
took power but the nazis banned many artists and in 1939 publicly 
burned more than 1000 works they deemed offensive 
socialist realism became the predominant style when the 
communists came to power in eastern berlin after world war ii 
artists who did not conform could not exhibit 
the unstable postwar political situation also affected west 
berlin the city found it hard to attract valuable works for 
museums while the city was divided 
sothebys sponsored a public exhibition that drew large crowds 
in october to see modern paintings by such artists as kandinsky 
matisse and modigliani 
christies flew in former nato secretarygeneral lord 
carrington now chairman of christies international for the 
official dec 10 opening of its berlin offices 
however it may take a while for berlin to become the site of 
the kind of spectacular auctions held regularly in london auctions 
are most likely to fetch higher prices in london where the public 
is more international than in berlin

americans connected to us embassies in six 
middle east and two african countries are being ordered home or 
permitted to return voluntarily as a result of unstable 
conditions related to the persian gulf the state department said 
today

other six countries had been announced earlier the official said 
there has been strong proiraqi sentiment in jordan and king 
hussein has been an outspoken advocate of a negotiated settlement 
to the gulf conflict the sudanese government meanwhile generally 
has been supportive of the iraqi position 
the statement indicates concern over the possibility that 
proiraqi sentiment in the eight countries could be directed at 
us diplomatic offices large antiamerican demonstrations have 
taken place in the sudan and jordan 
following is the list of actions concerning the safety of us 
citizens which had been taken previously 
dependents and nonessential personnel are being sent home from 
us embassies in sudan and yemen

theyre not exactly art treasures but there 
is a certain creativity in the items on display at carlas sandwich 
shop just outside the gates of florida state prison 
the collection confiscated from inmates by many of the shops 
customers ranges from a felttip pen concealing a razor blade to a 
vienna sausage can with a hidden compartment for drugs 
carla hawthorne owner of the shop and a former correctional 
officer hopes to eventually open a law enforcement museum that 
will show people the kinds of things officers deal with 
inmates run a con game on people mothers wives 
grandparents then they come down here and really see whats going 
on she said they are naughty boys inside 
she said visitors to the eatery which is near three 
jacksonville area prisons are sometimes surprised by the 
contraband that inmates imaginatively fashion from everyday items 
among the items on display are a key to a door lock made from a 
disposable razor blade and a variety of knives fashioned from 
pieces of wood metal and plastic glass there also are several 
zip guns in which small metal tubes are fashioned into crude 
weapons in which sulfur shavings from match sticks are used to fire 
nails or other projectiles 
but not all inmate creations are deadly mrs hawthorne also has 
on display toaster ovens made from cigarette package foil and light

prime minister nikolai i ryzhkov the target of 
relentless criticism over the economy suffered a heart attack 
after a government reshuffle left his job in doubt he was said 
wednesday to be out of danger 
soviet president mikhail s gorbachev visibly saddened 
delivered the news to the congress of peoples deputies in a slow 
soft voice 
a very difficult event last night nikolai ivanovich ryzhkov 
had a heart attack a coronary there is no threat to his life 
but thats the situation we wish him a return to health were 
very sorry 
a spokesman for the council of ministers or cabinet headed by 
ryzhkov said by telephone that the prime minister was out of danger 
and resting in a hospital on wednesday ryzhkov 61 was under 
constant surveillance but no other information was available 
said yuri i tyunkov 
the deputies reacted with silence to the news then returned to 
their days agenda on granting gorbachev more presidential powers 
the 2250member parliament had voted tuesday to eliminate 
ryzhkovs council of ministers and create a new cabinet under 
gorbachevs control it was unclear whether ryzhkov would retain 
the post of prime minister in the revamped body 
ryzhkov has been accused of delaying radical reforms that some 
consider necessary for halting the countrys economic crisis 
last fall rhzykovs conservative economic reform plan was 
pitted against a more radical plan pushed by russian republic 
leader boris yeltsin that put gorbachev in the middle of the 
fractious political battle that continues to paralyze the 
government 
in his face you could see the imprint of the constant worry 
about what was going on in the country and all the things people 
were saying about him said nadezhda a kryuchenkova a deputy 
from tambov she said she was among ryzhkovs critics 
the heart attack testifies to the fact that he really took to 
heart everything that the country was going through said air 
force marshall alexander n yefimov im very sorry that he will 
not be taking active part in government work for awhile 
yefimov said he believed ryzhkov would have been the top 
candidate for prime minister in the reorganized government but 
that now deputies did not expect ryzhkov to return to work any time 
soon 
his ouster long had been demanded by reformers but gorbachev 
stood by his friend 
ryzhkov was appointed by gorbachev in 1985 shortly after 
gorbachevs own ascent as communist party chief 
during his first years as prime minister ryzhkov was largely 
regarded as a faceless technocrat until he took control of a 
highprofile politburo commission overseeing relief efforts for 
victims of the december 1988 earthquake in armenia 
during his fiveyear tenure ryzhkov eliminated 25 ministries 
and oversaw the dismantling of dozens of other central offices a 
task he has described as a battle royal 
it was the same bureaucracy he had climbed through to become 
prime minister that job was considered the secondmost powerful 
before gorbachev proposed the new structure that would subordinate 
executive power to himself 
ryzhkov was born on sept 28 1929 to a miners family after 
graduating from the urals polytechnical institute with a degree in 
engineering he began working in 1950 at the giant uralmash 
machinebuilding complex in sverdlovsk where 20 years later he 
became its directorgeneral 
he joined the communist party in 1956 and became active in 
politics with his appointment to the supreme soviet commission on 
planning and budget in 1974 in 1981 he became a full member of 
the partys central committee 
in 1985 six weeks after gorbachev became general secretary 
ryzhkov was appointed a full member of the communist party 
politburo he was named chairman of the council of ministers in 
september of that year

on the whole id rather be in the bronx 
says alan j mergel a lawyer who specializes in personal injury 
cases if im a plaintiff id rather be there than any place in 
the world 
the bronx the borough where justice is tempered with 
generosity at least by juries in civil trials and especially if 
the city of new york is a defendant 
if they are not actually vehicles for the redistribution of 
wealth bronx civil trial juries are certainly more liberal than 
their counterparts 
according to a threeyear study by the new york jury verdict 
reporter bronx jury verdicts favor the plaintiff 79 percent of the 
time compared with 39 percent across the city line in westchester 
county and 57 percent nationally and almost one in five bronx 
personal injury verdicts exceeds 1 million 
why are bronx juries so hard on civil trial defendants notably 
the city the transit authority and any other governmental entity 
whose lawyers happen to walk in the courtroom door 
william kunstler the radical defense attorney says its 
because the bronx is a poor persons county a third world 
county filled with jurors who are skeptical of authority and 
eager to help the underdog 
more than two thirds of the boroughs residents are black or 
hispanic most are members of the working or lower middle classes 
people who are generally less willing or able to get themselves 
excused from jury duty than professionals 
if youre picking a jury you dont want an accountant says 
mergel those analytical minds tend to have trouble giving money 
away 
the bronx is famous for the runaway jury verdict one so 
generous that deep down not even the plaintiffs lawyer expects it 
in september for instance a jury awarded 93 million to a 
30yearold dishwasher who was intoxicated when he fell onto a 
subway track and was hit by a train 
francisco marinos lawyer argued that his client should have 
been removed from the subway platform after a token clerk noticed 
he was drunk the trial judge ruled the verdict was not supported 
by the evidence and ordered a new trial 
transit authority lawyer wallace gossett complains that even if 
a judge changes such a verdict people hear about the jurys 
award and rush into the courtroom with grandiose ideas about what 
they can recover 
victor kovner the citys lawyer makes no effort to conceal his 
disdain for the plaintiffs paradise in queens or staten island 
many more jurors pay property taxes he said and realize that 
the money comes out of their pockets 
whether or not bronx jurors are really robin hoods is almost 
beside the point lawyers think they are and that influences how 
most suits are settled out of court 
earlier this year mergel was negotiating a settlement in a 
judges chambers in westchester county his client an elderly 
woman who had fallen down a flight of stairs had been offered 
50000 by the defendant 
when mergel demurred the judge asked him do you know where 
you are if you were down there the bronx i wouldnt tell you to 
take it so mergel settled for 50000 if the stairway had been 
in the bronx he says he would have demanded twice as much and 
probably have gotten it

just three weeks before the un deadline for iraq to withdraw 
from kuwait or face possible attack an israeli newspaper said 
today that washington and baghdad had set a date for talks the 
state department denied the report 
the independent daily maariv quoting israeli diplomats in 
contact with american officials said secretary of state james a 
baker iii will likely meet with saddam hussein in baghdad on jan 
9 
but in a speech to jordanian politicians visiting baghdad 
tuesday saddam didnt appear willing to negotiate his position 
saying he wouldnt leave kuwait until the liberation of 
palestine the united states has refused any linkage between 
iraqs withdrawal from kuwait and the palestinian question 
also today in the arabian sea helicopterborne us sailors 
fired warning shots and then seized an iraqi vessel loaded with 
sugar and bound for the iraqi port of basra military spokesmen 
said in a fracas aboard the ship sailors were confronted by iraqi 
crewmen and female peace activists aboard the vessel 
us officials reported no injuries in the confrontation 
naval units of the multinational force arrayed against iraq are 
enforcing a unordered trade embargo aimed at forcing iraq to 
relinquish kuwait 
as tensions increase in the gulf the us state department took 
steps today to reduce the number of americans in the region 
it asked all nonessential personnel and dependents of us 
government workers to leave jordan and sudan before the jan 15 
deadline the united nations has set for iraq to withdraw or face 
the possibility of war 
the state department also recommended that us citizens defer 
travel to the two countries both of whose populations generally 
support iraq 
the state department also has said that proiraqi sentiment 
could be directed at americans in yemen mauritania bahrain the 
united arab emirates qatar and the eastern province of saudi 
arabia and therefore has recommended that nonessential personnel 
leave those countries as well 
the israeli newspaper said senior officials in washington told 
israeli representatives that baker would visit baghdad on jan 9 
despite proximity to the united nations jan 15 deadline for iraq 
to leave kuwait 
the newspaper said the date for talks aimed at resolving the 
gulf crisis was apparently set amid secret negotiations between the 
united states and iraq 
a state department spokeswoman however today denied any date 
had been set and an israeli foreign ministry spokesman said he had 
no information on such an agreement 
our embassy in baghdad is in almost daily contact with the 
iraqi foreign ministry there has been no iraqi movement on the 
question of dates said sondra mccarty the state department 
spokeswoman in washington 
saddam has previously offered to receive baker in baghdad on 
jan 12 but the white house has rejected that date as being too 
late it has said any date after jan 3 would not give iraq time to 
withdraw by the un deadline 
earlier this week however it was learned that iraq had 
recalled its ambassadors from western europe the united states and 
other nations there was speculation that iraq was planning a new 
diplomatic initiative 
diplomats in the region say saddam might be willing to make 
concessions if he can secure linkage between resolution of the 
persian gulf crisis and efforts toward establishing palestinian 
selfrule in the israelioccupied territories 
the united states has rejected linking an iraqi pullout from 
kuwait to the palestinian issue 
but maariv said a jan 9 bakersaddam meeting could be linked to 
plans by assistant secretary of state dennis ross to visit israel 
on jan 7 to discuss new middle east peace proposals 
the state department appears to be putting together a proposal 
for opening peace talks between israel and arab countries in tandem 
with holding municipal elections in the occupied territories the 
paper said 
maariv also reported military movement along israels border 
with jordan and israels chief of staff lt gen dan shomron 
said iraq might try to use jordan as a springboard for action 
against israel 
an israeli army spokesman declined comment on the reported 
military moves iraq has lately escalated threats to attack israel 
saying missiles would be fired at the jewish state if war breaks 
out in the gulf 
in his speech tuesday broadcast on iraqi state radio saddam 
again tried to link the palestinian question with iraqi withdrawal 
from kuwait 
let all the fleets and israel hear palestine comes first and 
it must be liberated he said 
saddam also reiterated his claim that kuwait was unjustly 
removed from iraqs rule by british colonial rulers he challenged 
western powers massing in the persian gulf to put the question of 
kuwaits future to an arab referendum 
why do they not hold a referendum to see the inclination of 
the majority of the arab people saddam asked

the massachusetts economy may be 
hurting but it had little impact on the bakery run by the nuns at 
st scholasticas priory the sisters fulfilling a mandate that 
they be selfsufficient did so well they were forced into a 
choice prayer or profit 
prayer won 
we couldnt keep up said mothr superior mary clare 
theres a great demand for it but to keep up to make a profit 
in todays automated world wed either have to produce so many 
that it would be destructive to our life of prayer or else go 
under 
the decision of the contemplative benedictine order was reached 
unanimously at a meeting last month mother mary clare said 
just before christmas the priory stopped using nine parttime 
workers from the community and trimmed 120 stores from its delivery 
list a market that stretched from nearby worcester to cambridge 
45 miles to the east 
mother mary clare wont disclose any financial information but 
the bakery provides the main income for the 20 nuns who also have 
a small publishing enterprise 
prayer is our main work she said actually prayer is 
interrupted by our work not the other way around work is fitted 
into two free time slots between 1030 am and 1230 pm and 
from 230 pm to 530 pm 
on a recent december day all was quiet at the bakery which is 
in a greensided building tucked among the trees lining petershams 
main street the priory proper consists of two buildings of gray 
and brown stone that evokes abbey architecture 
the bakery was set up five years ago to fulfill the religious 
orders requirement of selfsufficiency through manual labor 
that attention to detail lies behind the success of the priorys 
baked goods mother mary clare said 
the fruitcake orders are overwhelming theyre not ordinary 
fruitcakes they are our own special recipe and they dont have any 
of the preservatives she said 
after a writeup in yankee magazine weekly orders for goods 
were topping the thousands many for area stores and supermarkets 
but now the priory fills only a few store orders and 
concentrates on a mailorder business a workload the nuns say is 
easier to schedule and doesnt require the volume of wholesale 
many people have been phoning and writing and saying well 
im glad to hear that we can get it through the catalog mother 
mary clare said 
its not an intrusion on our contemplative life the way the 
other is she said 
the more relaxed pace left nuns feeling relieved she said we 
realized this was the direction god wanted us to take there was 
great peace and unanimity

in da up dey got a strange way of 
talkin eh a researcher says he has found the upper peninsulas 
real core of yoopanese the local lingo of cromers kromers and 
cudighis koodighees 
translation yoopanese is spoken by yoopers inhabitants of the 
up cromers means hats cudighis are sausages 
northern michigan university researcher stewart kingsbury calls 
the center of this linguistic mother lode the iron mountain 
triangle a region from marquette to bessemer to iron mountain 
including the keweenaw peninsula it isnt really a triangle but 
thats kingsburys word for it 
our dialect area received its heaviest influence from canadian 
english kingsbury said torries as those loyal to the british 
king were called fled into canada after the revolutionary war 
carrying their dialect with them 
then the loggers who came down from canada carried it into the 
upper peninsula so its roots are in a new england dialect 
as proof kingsbury offers his test words cost foster dog and 
water people in massachusetts and the michigan town michigamme 
probably will pronounce them the same way 
but underneath the canadian influence which punctuates yooper 
talk with plenty of eh is the mark of immigrations of 
finnish cornish and italian settlers 
yoopers use words like youse and dem just like people in 
the italian neighborhoods of the bronx kingsbury said 
as strange as their accent might sound to outsiders in some 
cases upper peninsula residents say words the way they should be 
said most americans wrongly call a sauna a sawna but yoopers 
know it right sowna

as of jan 1 federal workers will lose some 
options to make money on the side and theyll face tighter 
restrictions as well on what they can do even if they quit the 
government 
under the ethics reform act of 1989 government workers will not 
be allowed to take pay for giving speeches making other public 
appearances or writing articles even those unrelated to their 
jobs 
other provisions also effective jan 1 will curtail the 
contacts that exgovernment officials can have with former 
colleagues and with foreign clients 
the most restrictive rules cover cabinetlevel officials and 
other top presidential appointees they will be barred from 
lobbying anyone in the executive branch for a year after leaving 
their government jobs 
some already have cited the tighter conflictofinterest 
standards as a reason to quit before the new year and at least one 
lawsuit has been filed by federal workers who see the honoraria ban 
as an infringement of their right to free speech 
the increased focus on government ethics was cited by outgoing 
drug policy adviser william bennett when he walked away from a new 
job the republican national chairmanship after being advised by 
the white house that he should refrain from taking outside income 
to avoid any appearance of conflict even if technically legal 
i think clearly the bush administration has placed a real 
priority on the area of ethics and has said everybody better pay 
attention people are much more cognizant of potential 
conflicts said don campbell spokesman for the office of 
government ethics 
officials in his office say the most controversy surrounds the 
new honoraria ban affecting all government workers 
already proposals are circulating in congress to relax the rule 
somewhat but in the meantime it means internal revenue service 
worker jan adams grant of ogden utah will no longer be able to 
supplement her salary by writing articles about camping and the 
environment for such magazines as womans day and camping today 
grant joined the national treasury employees union suit seeking 
a declaration that the honoraria ban is unconstitutional insofar 
as it applies to activities which bear no connection to government 
service 
the new rules also 
bar former officials who have worked on trade or treaty 
negotiations from using their inside information to advise a 
client 
bar senior government officials from representing any foreign 
government or political party before any government agency except 
congress for a year after leaving office 
extend the oneyear ban on lobbying by cabinetlevel and high 
white house officials to cover not just the department where an 
individual worked but the entire executive branch of government 
limit any outside income for highlevel noncareer workers to 
15 percent of the governments executive level salary ii which 
will be 125100 on jan 1 
the pentagons top procurement officer john a betti said he 
was resigning effective dec 31 so that he would not be covered by 
the ethics restrictions earlier nasa lost several key employees 
who cited similar grounds for quitting earlier than they had 
planned 
bennett in turning down president bushs request that he head 
the republican national committee was unhappy with the rule 
barring him from representing the interests of outside employers to 
the white house for one year after his departure from the drug 
policy post 
bennett had a keen interest in making money on the lecture 
circuit according to the government ethics office bennett 
wouldnt have had a problem if he was just paid to make a speech to 
a group but he would have been prohibited from directly 
representing that groups interests to the white house 
as republican chairman bennett would have been constantly in 
touch with the white house over political issues and that would 
present a clear appearance if not legal problem according to 
white house counsel c boyden gray bennetts brother senate 
ethics committee special counsel robert bennett agreed with that 
assessment 
you add it all up and it does not look right gray said 
white house personnel director chase untermeyer said he gets few 
queries from officials or prospective appointees about 
postemployment conflicts despite the new rules 
it may well be that a lot of people including white house 
staffers dont think about the day they have to leave he said 
when that day comes he said there may be a lot of gulping 
as they learn what they can and cannot do

an intoxicated man falls and is hit by a new york subway a 
pedestrian is struck at a phoenix intersection with no traffic 
signals an inmate in illinois is beaten into a coma by another 
prisoner 
all sue the cities for damages and get multimilliondollar 
awards doled out by juries a judge even gives away city hall to 
settle one case 
a dozen years ago cities enjoyed the same broad immunity as 
states against such lawsuits but a 1978 us supreme court 
decision opened the floodgates 
the court said cities their agencies and city officials may be 
sued for violating an individuals civil rights damages could be 
awarded if the violation occurred while a city ordinance or 
official policy was being followed 
today some cities pay out millions each year as a result of 
damage suits new york city alone pays out between 150 million and 
200 million in los angeles 308 million was used to cover 1132 
suits filed in fiscal 198990 
in general terms its a shame because as a nation what were 
doing is suing ourselves into oblivion said steven atkins city 
administrator in iowa city iowa every time we turn around we 
cant take any action without the threat of some kind of 
litigation 
cities get sued because were here said lewis leigh 
executive director of the washington cities insurance authority an 
insurance pool for 70 cities in washington state 
they assume were good for some part of damages just because 
were around the law is fairly consistent in finding fault 
with cities we have to just grin and bear it 
struggling east st louis ill lost its city hall building 
when it couldnt pay off a judgment the city had so little money 
that a judge in september awarded city hall to a man who was 
braindamaged in a beating by another inmate in city jail he sued 
and was awarded 34 million the city is appealing 
pat dennis an assistant city attorney in oklahoma city says 
such lawsuits are a growing problem in her city 
many times they feel that the police used excessive force just 
putting handcuffs on them ms dennis said or they allege the 
jail is inadequate or the food is no good the imagination is the 
only thing that is the limit to what kind of suits there are this 
is their revenge 
a number of cities queried by the associated press said the 
number of lawsuits hasnt changed much in recent years 
people are always suing the city said roderick mcdougall 
phoenix city attorney they have a traffic accident and claim 
there was something wrong with the roadway or theyre hit by a car 
and claim the crosswalks werent clearly marked 
this year phoenix was ordered to pay 6 million in damages for 
failing to install traffic signals at an intersection near a high 
school the money went to a paralyzed victim of a traffic accident 
at the intersection phoenix is appealing the award 
philip shiner assistant los angeles city attorney said the 
number of lawsuits filed against the city have decreased but the 
settlement and verdict amounts are on the increase 
you can have one case in a given year that goes haywire or 
you can have two cases that skew the statistics shiner said 
inflation and attorneys fees in some cases increase the value of 
the case 
charleston wva city attorney john charnock thinks juries 
tend to rule against the city in such lawsuits 
i just think they look at the city and say they got plenty 
of money he said the city is a deeppocket defendant 
my own theory is one of antigovernment said albuquerque 
nm city attorney david campbell who said lawsuits against his 
city are increasing at 8 to 10 percent a year 
if youve ever had your dog picked up if youve ever been 
ticketed by the cops if youve ever had your water service cut off 
or a pothole in front of your house for weeks then you get a 
chance to serve on a jury and if the defendant is the city its 
payback time he said 
new york city successfully appealed a 93 million jury award to 
a dishwasher who was intoxicated when he fell onto a subway track 
and was hit by a train he argued that the transit authority should 
have followed its own rules and removed him from the platform after 
a token clerk noticed he was drunk he also argued the station was 
too dimly lit 
an appeals court set aside the verdict and ordered a new trial 
wallace gossett a transit authority lawyer says judicial 
review of jury verdicts saves the day for agencies such as his 
theres a problem however people hear about these enormous 
verdicts and rush into the courtroom with grandiose ideas about 
what they can recover

president bush should use the navy and air 
force to get iraq out of kuwait but not us ground forces a 
former top us arms control adviser suggested wednesday 
a ground assault on saddam husseins entrenched army in kuwait 
and iraq could put saddam at an advantage paul h nitze wrote in 
an opinion piece published in the washington post 
the object of strategy in a serious contest is to deny the 
opposition any possibility of finding a winning strategy of its 
own said nitze who was an arms control adviser in the reagan 
administration 
nitze wondered why president bush has committed so many ground 
forces in his 400000troop commitment against iraq in saudi arabia 
and the gulf 
why was such a commitment made he wrote was it because 
the us army in order to enhance its prestige as being a 
necessary part of joint offensive action in the gulf at a time of 
impending budget cuts did not wish to see the navy perhaps 
eventually augmented by selective air attack but without active 
participation of the army progressively squeeze iraq into full 
compliance with the un resolutions 
nitze said that if iraq were to have the enormous advantages 
of being dugin in prepared positions and of being on the 
defensive can saddam not have confidence that they could hold 
their own against us and allied forces traversing more than 100 
kilometers of desert for the attack 
in sum nitze wrote shouldnt the president bush now 
capitalize on saddams release of the hostages by switching his 
tactics to the more certain and prudent approach of giving the navy 
and the air force time progressively to squeeze the iraqi forces to 
the point where they would either themselves take offensive action 
against wholly unfavorable odds or better still where iraq would 
decide to comply with the un resolutions

one seaman aboard this 
hospital ship has two things that set him apart from the rest of 
the us military an iraqi passport and a brother fighting for 
iraqi president saddam hussein 
the 21yearold escaped iraq for the united states during the 
middle of the 198088 iraniraq war and he has been in the navy 
for two years 
he is still not sure how his mother arranged his airplane ticket 
out in 1984 but guesses it took a large bribe 
a lot of kids were coming home in body bags and my mother 
didnt want me to said wael using only his first name because 
his entire family remains in baghdad 
his only brother then 16 had already been drafted wael is 
sure his brother is back in the military because iraqi president 
saddam hussein has mobilized everyone up to age 33 since he invaded 
kuwait on aug 2 
i dont know what border he is on maybe the border with iran 
maybe turkey wael said but most likely kuwait 
he has not talked with his brother in at least eight months and 
the conversations they had before that were always terse because 
they were believed tapped he learned a little during two visits 
from his mother 
the brother said the elite republican guard was deployed behind 
his regular army unit to make sure it held firm against the 
iranians 
if people wanted to chicken out they just shot them if they 
tried to retreat wael said 
while his brother was fighting wael was living with his 
grandmother and uncle in paramus nj he joined the navy after 
graduating from paramus high school in june 1988 
i love the culture and the people and felt like i owed 
something to the people he said 
as a child he worshipped saddam wael remembers the time he and 
his brother hurled themselves out of the house halfdressed when 
they heard saddam was visiting a nearby school 
they were ecstatic because the iraqi president kissed his 
brothers hair and patted wael on the head 
we thought he was a hero he said 
that feeling gradually changed as the war with iran dragged on 
his fathers insurance business collapsed although the welltodo 
family maintained a comfortable life neighbors who publicly 
denounced the war disappeared 
iraq was easy to forget when wael was far away but memories 
are returning now 
baghdad is a beautiful city he said i miss swimming in 
the tigris river fishing there 
he hopes his family does not know he is in the persian gulf he 
told his relatives in the united states if anyone from iraq got 
through on the telephone to tell them he had gone to college and 
had yet to get in touch 
my mother would have a heart attack if she knew i was here 
he said 
as a medical photo assistant on the hospital ship one thats 
committed to treating anyone brought on board he will not be 
directly involved in fighting his fellow citizens 
he dreams of american planes bombing his homeland 
i wake up sometimes crying wael said 
he does not advertise his nationality among his shipmates but 
even those who know treat him normally wael said despite his 
military service he has yet to apply for us citizenship worried 
about official reaction to his iraqi origins 
im glad im on this side he said they are fighting for 
something thats not worth fighting for

nancy cruzan whose case led to a 
landmark us supreme court decision on the right to die died 
peacefully wednesday her parents by her side and euthanasia foes 
camped outside the hospital 
the 33yearold womans death at the missouri rehabilitation 
center came 12 days after a feeding tube implanted in her stomach 
nearly eight years ago was removed under court order at her 
parents request 
the cruzans had said their daughter who was left in what 
doctors called an irreversible vegetative state from a car 
accident would not want to continue living 
she remained peaceful throughout and showed no sign of 
discomfort or distress in any way joe and joyce cruzan said in a 
statement 
knowing nancy as only a family can there remains no question 
that we made the choice she would want the cruzans said 
nancy we will always love you and hold your memory in our 
hearts 
funeral arrangements were not announced 
the cruzans had fought for three years to allow their daughter 
to die and the case eventually reached the us supreme court 
in its 54 decision in june the court blocked the cruzans from 
withholding food and water in the absence of clear and 
convincing evidence she would have wanted to die 
after former coworkers testified they recalled ms cruzan 
saying she would never want to live like a vegetable a state 
judge ruled such evidence existed and gave permission dec 14 to 
remove the tube 
a spokesman for the society for the right to die said the 
ramifications of the case would be farreaching 
they supreme court judges found that there is a 
constitutional basis for the right to refuse treatment spokesman 
doron weber said from new york there is a constitutional basis 
for the right to refuse treatment 
we feel that nancy cruzan has made legal history but her 
dying is an entirely private matter 
ms cruzans courtappointed guardian attorney thad mccanse 
had agreed with the family that allowing her to die was in her best 
interest 
im grateful that the ordeal is over for nancy and the 
family said mccanse i also feel they can be proud that nancy 
has had an impact so people can make plans about things that are 
terrible things you hope never will happen 
but the rev joseph foreman of atlanta a founder of the 
antiabortion group operation rescue called ms cruzans death a 
tragedy with dangerous implications 
i think in the next few years you will see an entire industry 
spring up around putting people to death whom family friends and 
so forth have deemed to be no longer of use to anybody foreman 
said 
there will be wings of hospitals devoted to putting people to 
death like this 
after the tube was removed euthanasia opponents went to court 
seven times to try to force the state to resume feeding ms cruzan 
but were turned back for lack of legal standing 
nineteen demonstrators were arrested dec 18 when they stormed 
the hospital in an attempt to reattach the tube they were ordered 
to appear in court jan 3 on charges of trespassing and unlawful 
assembly 
antieuthanasia activists had maintained a roundtheclock vigil 
outside the hospital since dec 14 ten who had slept on the 
hospital steps tuesday night left a few hours after ms cruzans 
death was announced 
ms cruzan suffered severe brain damage when her car ran off a 
road as she drove home from her job at a carthage cheese plant jan

an estimated 10000 americans are in such conditions 
she suffered from seizures vomiting bleeding gums and 
diarrhea her care at the staterun hospital cost missouri 
taxpayers 112000 a year 
ms cruzans case prompted state and federal righttodie 
legislation 
it also spurred interest in living wills which spell out a 
persons wish for treatment and in using power of attorney to 
authorize someone else to make medical decisions if the individual 
is unable to do so 
as of july at least 41 states and the district of columbia had 
living will laws which allow individuals to make their wishes 
about medical treatment known in advance of a crisis that may 
render them unable to speak 
in november president bush signed legislation creating a sort 
of medical miranda warning under the law effective in 
november 1991 patients in medicare or medicaidsupported 
hospitals or nursing homes must receive written information 
explaining their righttodie options under their state laws

paperwork 
he just wanted to come back and be in the office a little 
bit white house spokesman steve hart said wednesday 
he said bush had no plans for staff consultations although it

hurrying back to deal with any pressures relating to the persian 
gulf crisis

bush was bored to tears midway through his 12day stay in the 
maryland countryside

the state department on wednesday ordered 
nearly 300 americans to leave jordan and sudan well before the 
jan 15 deadline for iraq to withdraw from kuwait 
jordan borders iraq and israel and has sided with president 
saddam hussein at times in his dispute with the united states over 
the 4 12month occupation sudans moslem fundamentalist 
government has supported the iraqi leader as well 
richard boucher a state department spokesman cited unstable 
conditions for the order it applies to about 80 americans in 
jordan and about 200 in sudan some are dependents of us 
officials in the two countries and others hold jobs considered 
nonessential 
boucher said the jordanian and sudanese governments were 
providing effective security to americans and other foreigners 
we nonetheless believe it prudent in the current circumstances 
to issue the order he said 
the order coincided with an extended impasse with iraq over 
president bushs proposal for highlevel talks in washington and 
baghdad 
the state department said there was no iraqi movement toward 
setting up a visit to baghdad by secretary of state james a baker 
iii 
with the jan 15 deadline for an iraqi pullout from kuwait 
approaching the two sides refused to budge from their proposed 
timetables for baker to meet with saddam 
the debate could soon become academic baker has said he would 
be willing to fly to baghdad only between dec 20 and jan 3 while 
iraq proposed jan 12 and held firm even after baker rejected the 
date as too close to the deadline for the withdrawal of all iraqi 
troops 
tariq aziz the iraqi foreign minister was originally scheduled 
to come to washington dec 17 but his meeting with bush was called 
off in light of the dispute over bakers trip 
maariv an israeli newspaper said baker probably would be in 
baghdad to see saddam on jan 9 but the state department and the 
israeli embassy said the report was erroneous 
in iraq joseph wilson iv the senior american diplomat at the 
us embassy telephoned nizar hamdoon the iraqi deputy foreign 
minister wednesday and reiterated bakers proposition 
weve offered 15 dates boucher said we were forthcoming 
but they have not shown themselves willing to avail themselves of 
our offer 
earlier sondra mccarty a state department spokeswoman told 
reporters there has been no iraqi movement on the question of 
dates 
other us officials said iraq has held consistently to jan 12 
in the nearly daily conversations wilson has held with hamdoon and 
others in the iraqi foreign ministry 
and don davidson a white house spokesman said jan 3 would 
remain the cutoff for baker to visit baghdad 
meanwhile the state department and the israeli embassy disputed 
the report in maariv which quoted unidentified israeli diplomats 
that baker probably would go to baghdad jan 9 
ruth yaron spokeswoman for the israeli embassy in washington 
said we have no knowledge of anything of the sort she called 
the newspaper report pure speculation 
baker remained in houston on vacation there was no indication 
at the state department a day after christmas of any special 
diplomatic activity on the crisis in the persian gulf 
the jan 15 deadline set by the un security council last month 
indirectly threatens iraq with military action if its troops do not 
depart the resolution was maneuvered through the council by the 
bush administration

us navy sailors trying to search a 
sugarladen iraqi ship in the arabian sea on wednesday fired 
warning shots when crewmen and women peace activists tried to stop 
the search 
the boarding was the most chaotic among the thousands carried 
out by the usled multinational forces enforcing the un trade 
embargo imposed to drive iraq from kuwait 
no injuries were reported in the 30minute predawn fracas in 
which british and australian sailors backed up the helicopterborne 
team from the uss trenton 
crew and passengers tried to hold the boarding party members 
back and grab their weapons said a us navy spokesman cmdr 
mark neuhart they tried to physically block the way to the pilot 
house 
lt col greg pepin told a military briefing in saudi arabia 
that the sailors fired pistols in the air as a warning and used 
smoke and noisemaking grenades to control the crowd aboard the 
11333ton vessel the ibn khaldoon 
it was more vocal than physical resistance neuhart said he 
said the presence of the peace activists and some reporters might 
have contributed to problems with the boarding near masirah 
island 
proiraqi press reports refer to the ibn khaldoon as the peace 
ship and say it was en route to the iraqi port of basra in a 
demostration of support for saddam hussein and his efforts to solve 
the persian gulf crisis 
the ship had an iraqi crew of 40 as well as 240 passengers 
mostly palestinian and iraqi women baghdad radio monitored in 
nicosia said women aboard were from 10 arab countries italy 
china the united states and japan 
sailors who searched the freighter found it carried 800 tons of 
sugar and other cargo such as rice cooking oil and milk all 
prohibited under the un trade embargo imposed to force iraq from 
kuwait 
the ship was later escorted to a nearby anchorage neuhart said 
the shipmaster agreed to divert the ship to an unidentified port to 
discharge the cargo he said the passengers could then resume their 
voyage to basra 
a doctor from the uss trenton an amphibious transport dock was 
sent to the ibn khaldoon after the shipmaster claimed the boardings 
caused two heart attacks and two miscarriages neuhart said 
the medical officer found no evidence to support the claims 
he said after consultations the master agreed that there were no 
injuries 
since the un trade embargo went into effect the us navy 
alone has challenged 5888 ships boarded 714 and diverted 30 
mainly in the arabian and red seas pepin said that in 10 of the 
interceptions warning shots were fired 
but the scuffling was somewhat unusual he said of 
wednesdays boarding 
the vessel which gave its departure point as aden yemen was 
first intercepted by the australian guidedmissile frigate hms 
sydney early wednesday but refused repeated requests to stop for a 
search 
the us sailors were the first to board the ship when it did 
stop 
that team was backed up by seaborne crews from the hms sydney 
the uss oldendorf and uss fife a british ministry of defense 
spokesman said royal marines from the hms brazen also descended 
onto the bridge of the iraq vessel from a lynx helicopter

civic leaders are worried the city is burning 
its bridges by refusing to pay for one 
years of shoring up relations with northern kentucky communities 
could come apart if the city refuses to pay its 10 million share 
for a new bridge over the ohio river development officials said 
this is foolishness we dont need said john williams 
president of the greater cincinnati chamber of commerce no one 
benefits from a fight between the north and south sides of the 
river 
one repercussion of the bridge debate is renewed sentiment among 
some kentucky leaders to rename the greater cincinnati 
international airport which is in northern kentucky 
four years ago former kentucky gov martha layne collins 
proposed that the airports name be changed to reflect its 
location cincinnatians were horrified 
but the movement is gaining strength again now that the city is 
backing out of the bridge project williams said 
ive already heard rumblings about it on that side of the ohio 
river he said 
irvin callery a city commissioner in covington ky is one of 
those doing the rumbling 
im prejudiced but ive always thought its name should be the 
greater covington airport he said it only makes sense 
the bridge thats at the center of the dispute has been proposed 
because studies show that the existing bridges becoming overcrowded 
as more people build homes in northern kentucky and work in 
cincinnati roughly 15000 northern kentuckians work downtown 
standing in the way of the 559 million project is the 
cincinnati city councils refusal to put up the 10 million because 
of a tight budget and other development projects that have higher 
priority 
a jan 7 deadline has been set for the city to change its mind 
if the city council doesnt change its mind the money set aside 
by ohio and the federal highway administration is likely to be 
shifted to a bridge linking maysville ky and aberdeen ohio 
about 45 miles east of cincinnati 
weve got the money to build this bridge but we cant get it 
done because cincinnati has not made a financial commitment said 
doug alexander a press aide to kentucky gov wallace wilkinson 
bernard hurst director of the ohio department of 
transportation said the state was losing interest in the bridge 
project because weve been working with the city for more than 1 
years and weve been unable to get the city to agree on a funding 
package 
if the bridge isnt built efforts to build up relations with 
northern kentucky could come unraveled williams said 
we have worked like heck to build some trust and communication 
between both sides of the ohio river and now this happens 
williams said

a political action committee founded by rep 
dick armey rtexas has agreed to pay a 3000 fine to settle 
charges that it violated federal election law officials said 
wednesday 
a spokesman for the federal election commission said the pac 
established by armey accepted an illegal contribution and failed to 
file proper and timely election reports in 1988 
commission spokesman fred eiland said armeys policy innovation 
political action committee or pipac agreed on oct 2 to pay a 
3000 civil penalty the sixmember commission approved the 
agreement dec 20 
armey founded pipac to help elect likeminded conservatives to 
the house it contributed 21500 to 30 candidates this year 12 
were elected 
armeys spokesman ed gillespie described the violations as 
just basically technical errors 
these were charges made by armeys political opponent john 
wayne caton gillespie said wednesday the fact is that more 
serious charges were proven to be false and were dropped 
the fec however said it initiated the complaint against pipac 
the settlement agreement covers a variety of complaints ranging 
from failure to file reports on time to accepting an excess 
contribution 
eiland said the committee accepted three contributions of 2000 
each in 1988 from james lightner the retired chairman of 
electrospace systems inc of richardson texas a defense firm now 
owned by chrysler corp the limit on contributions from an 
individual to a pac is 5000 a year 
eiland said the pac received the 2000 contributions from 
lightner in february june and september but disclosed in an 
october report that lightners total contributions for the year 
totaled just 5000 
gillespie however said the excess contribution should have 
been attributed to lightners wife ida 
eiland said the pac was also 110 days late in filing one 
election report and 11 days late in filing another

three jewish radicals were freed wednesday 
after serving less than seven years for killing three arabs and 
maiming two palestinian mayors in car bombings they were greeted 
as heroes by fellow jewish settlers 
the three members of the jewish underground that carried out 
attacks in the west bank in the early 1980s had their original 
life sentences reduced three times by israeli president chaim 
herzog they were released on good behavior 
in the occupied gaza strip israeli troops shot and killed a 
palestinian after he stabbed three soldiers on patrol in the shati 
refugee camp the army said 
doctors at gazas shifa hospital said the palestinian was shot 
more than 30 times palestinian reports identified him as ala 
abdullatif obeid 30 from shati 
the army reported two of the stabbing victims were in moderate 
condition and the third was slightly injured 
brig gen shmuel zucker division commander in the gaza strip 
noted that the attack followed a rash of stabbings that have been 
grabbing headlines 
everyone who intends to hurt an army patrol tries to do this 
with a knife when he cant get a gun he told army radio 
the death brought to 780 the number of palestinians killed by 
israeli soldiers or civilians during the 3yearold uprising 
against israels occupation of the west bank and gaza strip 
at least 322 palestinians have been slain by fellow arabs most 
on suspicion of helping israel fiftyseven israelis also died in 
the violence 
dozens of west bank settlers danced and chanted outside 
maasiyahu prison in the central israeli town of ramle as the three 
former members of the underground menahem livni shaul nir and 
uzi sharbav were released 
members of the crowd hoisted the three men on their shoulders 
and noam arnon of the gush emunim settler movement praised them for 
their love of israel 
they are heroes because they decided to sacrifice themselves 
their future their families for the security of jews he said 
on israel radio 
tiran pollock a leader of the antiarab kach movement said on 
army radio that the underground created a spirit taken up by other 
israelis you see it on the streets you see it more and more 
the underground has only begun he said 
about a dozen israeli liberals held a counterdemonstration to 
protest that the early release of the men would encourage attacks 
on arabs 
this is a message of contempt for human life of making a 
difference between one type of life and another and it violates 
the basic tenet of equality before the law said yitzhak zamir a 
former attorney general 
leftwing legislator yossi sarid also condemned the early 
release 
what i conclude from this is that in order to be a murderer 
and then to go home peacefully after a very short time the most 
important thing is that you kill an arab and in this way you 
turn a lawful government into a joke sarid said on israel 
television 
the three settlers were the last of 27 members of the jewish 
underground to be freed from prison 
the group carried out car bombings that blew the limbs off two 
west bank mayors bassam shaka of nablus and karim halaf of 
ramallah and a grenade and gun attack that killed three students 
and wounded 30 others at hebrons islamic college 
failed attempts to bomb five arab buses and blow up the dome of 
the rock one of islams holiest monuments were also blamed on the 
group 
livni the leader of the group was asked by israel radio 
wednesday if he was sorry for his actions 
the use of the word regret in this case is childish he 
replied he said he acted because of the governments failure to 
combat arab terror 
herzog reduced the sentences of the three men to 24 years then 
15 then 10 after announcing the last reduction in 1989 the 
presidents spokesman said herzog was convinced that the three 
had expressed unambiguous and honest regrets 
two weeks ago a parole committee cut the terms by another third 
for good behavior in israel a life sentence usually means the 
inmate must serve at least 20 years 
livni was convicted of masterminding the car bombings and nir 
and sharbav were found guilty of the hebron attack they were 
arrested in april 1984 and convicted in july 1985 
shaka who is wheelchairbound after losing his legs in the 
explosion said wednesday that the early release was part of 
israeli government policy to encourage extremists to act against 
palestinians

sales of existing homes showed a modest 3 
percent increase in november a real estate trade group said 
wednesday some analysts took the report as a possible harbinger of 
better days ahead for the slumping housing industry 
the national association of realtors said that sales of existing 
singlefamily homes last month posted their first increase since a 
51 percent advance in august 
sales had fallen 94 percent in september and 38 percent in 
october pushing the annual sales rate to its lowest level in 
almost six years 
the 3 percent november rise lifted sales to an annual rate of 
314 million units still 12 percent below where they were a year 
ago 
some analysts however said they believed the november increase 
could at least mark the end of a twoyear slide in housing although 
they cautioned against looking for much of a rebound before spring 
although the worst is probably over for the housing sector it 
is going to be a long bottom said david wyss an economist with 
drimcgraw hill inc mortgage rates have not come down that much 
and with home prices still declining people are afraid to buy 
wyss said that he expected to see housing sales begin to rebound 
in the spring helped out by the aggressive credit easing being 
conducted by the federal reserve 
allen sinai chief economist of the boston co said a rebound 
in the depressed housing industry will be critical if the country 
is to avoid a lengthy recession since there is little prospect that 
other segments of the economy will be showing much strength 
home sales and housing construction have really been in a 
recession for two years now housing is traditionally the first 
sector into a downturn and the first sector out and we think that 
will occur this time as well he said 
analysts credited the slight improvement in november to 
continued declines in mortgage rates rates on 30year fixed 
mortgages which have fallen to the lowest levels in three years now 
stand at 964 percent 
harley e rouda president of the realtors group said he 
believed that consumers had been scared away from potential 
purchases in august and september because of the turmoil in 
financial markets following iraqs aug 2 invasion of kuwait 
once mortgage rates settled down consumers felt more at ease 
about buying a home rouda said 
the median price for a home in november was 91300 down 17 
percent from the midpoint level in october and down 19 percent 
from the median price a year ago 
the november sales increase was led by strength in the south and 
west sales in the south jumped 73 percent to a seasonally 
adjusted annual rate of 132 million units although this was still 
5 percent below the sales pace set in november 1989 
sales rose 2 percent in the west to an annual rate of 500000 
units 
sales continued to slump in the northeast falling 2 percent in 
november to an annual rate of 490000 units down 17 percent from a 
year ago 
sales in the midwest were unchanged in november from the october 
sales rate of 820000 units

garry kasparov of the soviet union retained 
his title as world chess champion on wednesday with a draw in the 
22nd game staving off a challenge from fellow soviet anatoly 
karpov 
the two ended the 22nd game of their chess championship series 
in a draw after the 43rd move the halfpoint each player received 
put kasparov ahead in the scheduled 24game series 1210 
the 27yearold kasparov needed a 1212 tie in the series to 
retain the title 
despite kasparovs clinching a tie in the series the two rivals 
must continue playing to see who wins the majority of the 3 
million purse if there is a draw after 24 games the purse will be 
split 
kasparov won the title from karpov in 1985 and defended it in 
1986 and 1987 karpov took the championship in 1975 when american 
bobby fischer refused to defend the title he won in 1972 
kasparov playing white arrived promptly at the 5 pm 11 am 
edt starting time at the palais des congres fidgeted with his 
pieces awaiting the arrival of karpov then made his first move 
advancing his kings pawn before his rival entered 
karpov 10 minutes late made an identical first move 
the game had been delayed by a week karpov had called a timeout 
last saturday then the organizers called a technical timeout on 
christmas eve twice postponing the game 
the series began in new york in october 
kasparov had won the last three times he has had white in the 
nine games in lyon 
karpov had only won twice in the 21 previous games of this 
series 
the two soviet grandmasters have had six draws in the french 
portion of the championship they drew 10 times in the 12 games 
played in new york between oct 8 and nov 7

king michael romanias former monarch returned 
to exile in switzerland wednesday after being expelled by the 
bucharest government less than 12 hours after he arrived in his 
homeland on his first visit in 43 years 
the 69yearold former king returned to romania one year after 
the execution of communist dictator nicolae ceausescu in a popular 
revolution the communist takeover in 1947 forced the monarch into 
exile 
the bucharest government called michaels brief visit a cheap 
sensation government spokesman bogdan baltazar said in a 
statement that michaels presence in romania was totally 
illegal 
the romanian government facing mounting strikes and protests by 
an opposition that accuses it of being a communist regime in 
disguise apparently had feared the visit by michael might stir up 
unrest it threw him out on grounds he had not secured permission 
to visit 
in bucharest wednesday about 300 protesters marched up the main 
boulevard shouting king michael king michael the opposition 
civic alliance called for a referendum on restoring romanias 
former constitutional monarchy 
the statement also urged parliament to condemn the expulsion and 
invite michael back 
sorin botez vice president of the opposition national liberal 
party protested the expulsion saying his majesty the king is a 
romanian and has been the first and perhaps the greatest victim of 
communism 
after ceausescu was overthrown the former king had said he was 
ready to return from exile as head of a constitutional monarchy 
if my people want me to come back 
the national salvation front which took power during last 
years revolution in romania and won subsequent elections had 
refused to grant him a visa however 
in june the former king accused the front of leading the 
country back toward communist dictatorship 
before being put on a romanianchartered flight to switzerland 
wednesday morning michael termed his expulsion a rather sorry 
state of affairs 
the plane carrying the former monarch and a small entourage 
later landed at zurich airport airport officials said the king 
was traveling by connecting flight to geneva where he lives 
michael had arrived in bucharest late tuesday on his private 
plane from switzerland 
he was accompanied by his wife ana de bourbonparme his 
daughter sophie and several journalists and aides they were met 
by another daughter margarita who was already in romania on a 
visit 
they were stopped by police and escorted back to the airport 
the former king who is of the house of 
hohenzollernsigmaringen ruled romania twice for short periods he 
first succeeded his grandfather ferdinand in 1927 as michael i 
after his father carol left the country 
after returning in 1930 carol acceded to the throne and ruled 
for 10 years michael was then crowned again and reigned until he 
was forced to abdicate when the communists took power in 1947 he 
later declared the abdication invalid 
during world war ii he ruled briefly under gen ion antonescu 
who was allied with the axis led by nazi germany michael is seen 
as important in the 1944 coup that removed antonescu allowing 
romania to change sides and support the allies

a leading christian warlord said 
wednesday that lebanons newly formed government is incapable of 
ending lebanons civil war because of its strong tilt toward syria 
the makeup of the government does not insure the minimum 
degree of an independent authority we shall not abandon our right 
to free sovereign decision making rightist warlord samir geagea 
told a news conference 
the commander of the mainly maronite catholic lebanese forces 
the christians main militia also appealed for urgent arab league 
intervention to rescue a peace plan it brokered to reconcile 
lebanons warring factions 
this is an imbalanced government which cannot possibly 
reconcile the main antagonists of the civil war geagea said 
nonlebanese considerations and interests are dominant in the new 
cabinet 
geagea and george saadeh leader of the phalange party the 
maronites mainstream political force have rejected the posts 
assigned to them in prime minister omar karamis new cabinet 
the 1 million maronites make up the nations largest christian 
sect and have dominated in lebanon since it gained independence 
from france in 1943 
at least two other christians on wednesday refused their posts 
in the new cabinet of 30 warlords and politicians that was formed 
monday to oversee a moslemchristian national reconciliation 
michel sassin a greek orthodox named minister of labor said he 
would take up his post only if geagea and saadeh join the 
government nadim salem a catholic who was appointed minister of 
public works also said he would not join the government unless 
phalangists and the lebanese forces end their boycott 
geagea and saadeh have said the dominant representation of 
prosyrian factions in the new cabinet implies it has been dictated 
by syria both called it a fait accompli government 
syria is lebanons main power broker it has 40000 troops 
stationed in northern eastern and central lebanon under a 1976 
peacekeeping mandate from the arab league 
but the arab league last year sponsored a special session of the 
lebanese parliament in the saudi town of taif that approved a peace 
plan based on moslemchristian equal powersharing 
the plan also calls for the disbanding of lebanons militias by 
march 21 and for the syrian army to gradually withdraw from beirut 
and major towns over the next two years and redeploy in east 
lebanons bekaa valley 
geagea and saadeh contend they represent the major christian 
fighting forces and that no national reconciliation is possible 
without their participation as the main christian negotiators 
president elias hrawi a maronite and karami a sunni moslem 
have tried both directly and through intermediaries to persuade 
geagea and saadeh to join the new government 
karami has to present his cabinet to parliament next week to 
seek a vote of confidence 
seven christian and moslem warlords have been appointed state 
ministers without portfolios in the new cabinet to gain their 
approval of a plan to disarm and disband their militias 
geageas 6000member lebanese forces control more than 70 
percent of lebanons christian heartland north and northeast of 
beirut

the united states believes saddam 
hussein may attack israel and try to break the international 
coalition of forces arrayed against him if he fears war is 
inevitable a us military intelligence expert said wednesday 
the iraqi president is showing no sign of withdrawing from 
kuwait and it looks increasingly likely that hundreds of thousands 
of iraqs troops will have to be forced from the emirate said air 
force lt col tom coury a member of the us central command 
intelligence staff 
he warned that iraq which has the most extensive chemical 
arsenal in the third world would likely use such weapons against 
attacking coalition forces 
coury was one of three speakers at the first regular weekly news 
briefing by the us central command held in a hotel ballroom in 
the saudi arabian capital and broadcast live by cnntv 
the military deliberately chose 6 pm for the briefing to avoid 
any comparison with the daily 5 pm briefing during the vietnam 
war dubbed 5 oclock follies by reporters if hostilities 
break out in the persian gulf there will also be daily briefings 
with the jan 15 un deadline for iraq to pull out of kuwait 
only three weeks away coury said we see absolutely no 
indication that saddam hussein intends to withdraw from kuwait 
he said a key indicator that saddam intends to stay in kuwait 
for the long haul is the tremendous resources he is 
spending to fortify the small oilrich nation at a time when iraq 
is being subjected to un economic sanctions 
lt col greg pepin an army artillery officer selected as the 
regular military briefer said iraq is estimated to be losing 100 
million in revenue a day or 3 billion monthly 
coury said for the immediate future we think he saddam will 
attempt to avoid conflict while working to erode both us public 
support and allied cooperation 
as a last resort if he fears war is inevitable he could 
initiate open conflict which may include a provocation with israel 
and an attemt to decouple the coalition forces he said 
asked whether he believed it was realistic for iraq to attack 
israel coury said i think it is very realistic 
israel has kept an uncharacteristically low profile since the 
aug 2 iraqi invasion of kuwait to keep from upsetting the fragile 
coalition of western and islamic forces confronting saddam 
coury said saddam continues to pour both men and materials 
into the country and along his flank to the west 
the iraqi leader is constructing massive defenses in kuwait 
including trenches minefields barriers and hundreds of miles of 
barbedwire fences he said 
iraq now has over a halfmillion troops thousands of tanks 
2500 armored personnel carriers and 2700 artillery pieces in 
kuwait and southern iraq coury said 
he said iraqi troops in kuwait are being adequately supplied 
though he would not elaborate 
on the fighting quality of the iraqis he said the ground 
fortifications are formidable but they more of world war i vintage 
and well be looking at a technologically superior force going 
after that sort of defenses 
the republican guards who were in the vanguard of the invasing 
troops are the most capable forces he said 
exactly how the remainder of the army would react under 
combat under invasion of their own country its difficult to 
say he said 
iraq has thinned out its ground forces along the iranian border 
to reinforce defenses in kuwait coury said along the turkish 
border iraq has mainly infantry with some heavy units 
overall iraq flight activity has generally increased with a 
definite increase in fighter training and operation he said 
but although iraq has the largest air force in the middle east 
with over 700 combat aircraft coury said they are no match for 
the combined strength of coalition airpower 
maj gen dane starling central commands director of 
logistics said saddam still has time to withdraw everything from 
kuwait by the jan 15 deadline

federal authorities on wednesday were seeking a 
motive for two highpowered explosions that knocked out power at an 
electrical substation and at a hotelcasino just outside this 
gaming resort city 
they also were trying to determine whether the two saturday 
night blasts caused by dynamite or some kind of high explosive 
were related to the detonation of a smoke bomb at the same 
hotelcasino a short time later 
there were two separate explosions and we believe they could 
have been related said sig celaya resident agentincharge of 
the las vegas office of the federal bureau of alcohol tobacco and 
firearms 
no injuries were reported in the explosions which caused an 
estimated 650000 damage and left 3000 nevada power co customers 
without electricity for several hours authorities said they had no 
suspects and no arrests had been made 
the first blast destroyed a nevada power co substation at jean 
about 30 miles southwest of las vegas damage was estimated at 
400000 
a second blast a short time later destroyed an emergency 
generator at the nearby nevada landing hotel and casino and blew 
out windows on one side of the complex causing an estimated 
250000 in damages guests were transferred to other hotels 
the explosions were similar in size and detonation celaya said 
wednesday 
a man in the casino set off a smoke grenade after the second 
explosion said celaya we dont want to speculate on the 
situation he said 
we dont know if the smoke grenade was related to the two 
bombings celaya said it could have been anything from using 
the grenade to provide light to a robbery situation 
no robbery demands were made and no robbery took place he said 
las vegas metro police and clark county fire department 
investigators joined the atf in searching for clues 
evidence from the blast sites was sent to the atfs laboratory 
in san francisco celaya said 
nevada landing reopened this week a company spokeswoman 
declined to comment on the explosion and smoke bomb except to say 
that the hotelcasino had received no threats

iraq testfired a surfacetosurface 
missile wednesday but the projectile was aimed away from the 
multinational forces massed in saudi arabia the us central 
command said 
the command said in a statement it had received indications 
that iraqi armed forces conducted activity that included the 
firing of another surfacetosurface missile within iraq 
previous such firings put some of the 300000 american forces 
deployed in operation desert shield on a heightened state of alert 
but the us command would not comment on the current alert status 
the missile landed in iraq the flight path of the missile was 
away from us and coalition forces the firing appeared to be part 
of an additional training or testing mission the statement said 
no further details were available on the type or exact direction 
of the missile fired or on the methods used to detect it 
us troops were already on heightened alert because of the 
possibility of a terrorist attack over the christmas and new year 
holidays 
last friday some us forces went on a lowlevel alert for a 
possible chemical attack after a missile firing it turned out to 
be an israeli missile test fired into the mediterranean 
british and us military officials reported that iraq test 
fired scud missiles from east to west on dec 2 prompting some 
units to don gas masks against a possible chemical attack 
if the missiles were fired north to south they would hit saudi 
arabia 
the los angeles times reported last week that iraqi test firing 
of three mediumrange missiles apparently took us military 
officials by surprise 
the first launch of the series was completed before american 
satellites and sensors noticed it the times reported and israeli 
and us officials readied their air forces 
the iraqis are estimated to have 500 to 1000 surfacetosurface 
missiles of various types either sovietbuilt ss1 scudbs or 
iraqi variants 
baghdad bought 1500 to 2000 scudbs during the 198088 war 
with iran and launched scores during that conflict

gov william donald schaefer personally 
apologized wednesday for a state work crew which mistakenly cut 
down seven trees bordering arun vohras yard 
we made a mistake and were going to do everything we can to 
rectify it said schaefer in a visit to vohras home in this 
washington suburb 
the governor accompanied by several aides including state 
transportation secretary james lighthizer made the 40mile trip 
from annapolis to see vohra and the stumps that remained along the 
highway outside his house after the saga known familiarly as the 
bethesda chain saw massacre 
one of the felled trees was a massive cedar 80 feet to 100 feet 
high that was a great tree admitted the governor 
schaefer called the treecutting incident a result of missed 
communications we made a mistake and we learned said 
the governor 
the story of the seven destroyed trees all on a state 
rightofway began last spring when vohra notified the state 
highway administration about a diseased pine tree on state property 
in front of his house 
a few days later he came home and found that tree still 
standing but six other awesome trees two pines three 
blooming dogwoods and a giant lilac had been cut 
he complained and soon another state official came to his house 
and was shown the suspect tree vohra said he marked the tree with 
a ribbon but then next time around he returned from work and 
found the massive cedar a few feet from the pine tree had been cut 
the pine tree still was untouched 
i acted a little crazy recalled vohra he called the 
governors mansion in annapolis his state delegate his 
congresswoman and the state department of natural resources and 
the story began to get some press 
vohra was informed this week that the governor wanted to visit 
so he made coffee and ordered some extra food for his guests 
as the entourage arrived vohra expressed surprise at all the 
attention given his loss i had no idea this would ever happen 
he said 
schaefer said we want to do the right thing and promised 
the state would replace whatever trees vohra chooses im tree 
conscious said the governor reminding reporters he has vowed to 
plant 1 million trees in maryland 
the two men posed atop the stump that once had been the massive 
cedar nearby was the pine that started all the trouble state 
officials have since said its not diseased at all but only the 
target of woodpeckers

another 300 trailer homes have been moved into the disputed 
territories in the past year oron quoted sharon as saying 
oron said sharon insisted the government was not steering soviet 
immigrants to the occupied territories in keeping with american 
conditions for 400 million in loan guarantees voted by congress 
this year 
but oron argued that a housing shortage in israel could easily 
propel immigrants to the occupied territories 
people go where there are apartments whether they are 
immigrants or old timers oron said 
sharon never said it was being built for immigrants but i 
think hes putting the issue at risk since the americans are 
unequivocally against their money reaching the territories oron 
added 
a communique from sharons office said a total of 33000 
trailers were to be purchased over the next year but did not say 
where they would be parked 
sharons spokesman nimrod granit was not available at his 
office to comment 
sharon a former defense minister has led the jewish settlement 
effort in the occupied lands since 1977 when he first joined an 
israeli cabinet as agriculture minister 
labor party leader shimon peres has also accused the government 
of indirectly pushing immigrants to move to the occupied 
territories by moving trailers there 
once the trailers are built there they will say we have no 
choice the immigrants have no place to live and they will be 
forced to move there peres was quoted as telling a party forum 
on dec 13 
in washington state department deputy spokesman richard boucher 
on wednesday said israeli authorities have provided assurances that 
they are not going to direct immigrants from the soviet union 
beyond the green line israels internationally recognized 
border until 1967 
he also reaffirmed us opposition to israels policy of 
establishing settlements in the territories calling the activity 
an obstacle to peace 
soviet immigration has totaled more than 170000 this year and 
construction of housing in israel has fallen far short of demand 
israeli reports say construction is under way on less than half 
of 45000 apartments planned for this year 
they said sharon promised the committee that all would be in the 
building process by the end of the fiscal year in april 
meantime immigrant families are doubling up in apartments in 
some israeli towns many arriving in the past month have been put 
up temporarily in hotels and army bases

what do greg lemond joe montana and garry 
kasparov have in common 
all three are world champions in their sports the last five 
years not once or twice but three times 
kasparov the reigning world chess champion finished off 
anatoly karpov for the third straight time in the championship 
finals with a draw on wednesday and proved once again that he is at 
the top of his sport like cycling champion lemond and san 
francisco 49ers quarterback montana 
lemond has won the worlds most prestigious race the tour de 
france the last three times he has competed in it 
montana is considered the finest quarterback in pro football 
and has four super bowl rings to disprove naysayers 
now kasparov world chess champion since 1985 has reaffirmed 
himself as the worlds premier chess strategist 
kasparov was aprodigy starting to play chess at 4 
he was born april 13 1963 in baku azerbaijan and was 
originally named gary kimovich weinstein at six after the death 
of his father he was taken in by his mothers family and adopted 
her name klara kasparova 
kasparov soon showed his chess potential winning the soviet 
junior championship at 13 and the world junior title at 17 
he challenged karpov for the world title in 1984 which resulted 
in a notable confrontation 
karpov went ahead 50 in a match when draws didnt count 
kasparov came back to narrow the score to 53 
suddenly after five months and 48 games the international 
chess federation decided to call off the contest saying it was for 
the good of the players 
kasparov took the championship outright in 1985 by a score of 
1311 to become the youngest champion in the history of chess at 
22 
he retained the crown in 1986 in a series split between london 
and leningrad 125115 
in their last meeting in seville in 1987 karpov led 1211 
going into the final game 
kasparov unshaven and needing a victory to even the series and 
retain his title played aggressively rallied to win the game and 
save his title 
it was an electric atmposphere the final day and a 10minute 
standing ovation to the cheers of torero torero that 
traditionally hail bullfighters accompanied the triumph 
kasparov went for the kill this time scoring a convincing win 
over karpov 
after playing to 10 draws of 12 games in new york kasparov won 
three of the last seven games with three draws to beat karpov 
the two men who are known to dislike each other differ in 
temperment looks politics and even playing style 
kasparov is talkative and flamboyant playing chess with 
creativity and decisiveness 
karpov 39 is often protrayed as a colorless introvert who 
plays with surgical precision 
i have two loves karpov has said communism and chess 
normally chess is a battle between two individuals kasparov 
once said in an interview but in my case with karpov its a 
fight between two different mentalities in russia i identify him 
with the system ive been fighting 
karpov represents the power authorities kasparov said in a 
previous interview he was soviet leader leonid brezhnevs boy 
when brezhnev was in power and is president mikhail gorbachevs 
boy when gorbachev is in power 
the pairs personality clash has endured more 150 encounters in 
official competition over 700 hours 
but in lyon after a draw or a decision they often discussed 
their play almost amicably 
i know him he knows me kasparov said in an interview 
you have to realize he is the only serious opponent for me i am 
talking chess with the no two in the world 
kasparov is the highestrated player in the history of the 
sport with 2800 points in rating chess grandmasters the previous 
best was 2785 by american chess genius bobby fischer who held the 
world title from 1972 until he refused to defend it in 1975 that 
allowed karpov to take it until kasparaov came along 
married last year kasparov dabbles in other fields he likes 
jogging tennis and has attended a number of games of the soccer 
club moscow spartak 
he founded one of the first computer clubs in the soviet union 
and was an advocate for getting paid his prize money in 
tournaments that led to soviet tennis players natalia zvereva and 
andrei chesnokov also demanding their winnings rather than 
splitting them with the state

saddam hussein said the american army would lose a war with iraq 
because it doesnt have right on its side washington took 
steps wednesday to pull american civilians from the increasingly 
tense persian gulf region 
in the arabian sea meanwhile us and other sailors enforcing 
the un trade embargo aimed at forcing iraq from kuwait fired 
warning shots in a fracas with crew members and female activists 
aboard an iraqi ship 
but there were also reports of renewed diplomacy in the 
4monthold gulf crisis an israeli newspaper said wednesday that 
washington and baghdad had broken a deadlock and set a date for 
talks 
the independent daily maariv quoting israeli diplomats in 
contact with american officials said secretary of state james a 
baker iii will likely meet with president saddam in baghdad on jan 
9 the state department denied any date was set 
jan 15 is the un deadline for iraq to withdraw from kuwait or 
face possible attack 
saddam has recalled his ambassadors from western europe the 
united states and other nations but there is speculation iraq is 
planning a new diplomatic initiative 
in an interview broadcast wednesday by mexican television 
though saddam spoke only of war 
it is certain that the american army will be defeated 
saddam told mexicos televisa network but you know why because 
it does not have right on its side because the american army 
has left its land has come to kill a people who live in 
security and in stability 
in riyadh saudi arabia a us intelligence officer gave a 
bleak assessment wednesday of peace prospects air force lt col 
tom coury of the us central command intelligence staff said us 
officials think saddam may attack israel to break up the 
international force opposing him if he believes war is inevitable 
we see absolutely no indication that saddam hussein intends to 
withdraw from kuwait coury said 
he also said it is likely iraq will use chemical weapons if it 
is attacked 
in another development the us central command said iraq 
testfired a surfacetosurface missile wednesday the projectile 
was aimed away from the multinational forces massed in saudi 
arabia officials said no other details were available 
in his broadcast comments saddam reiterated he would not allow 
the united states to set a date for his meeting with baker 
washington has suggested a meeting on or before jan 3 but saddam 
has insisted talks be held jan 12 
the iraqi people reject that its president receives orders 
from outside saddam said 
washington also appeared to have little optimism about the 
crisis the state department asked all nonessential personnel and 
dependents of us government workers to leave jordan and sudan 
before the jan 15 deadline 
the state department recommended that us citizens defer travel 
to the two nations both of whose populations generally support 
iraq 
it said earlier that proiraqi sentiment could be directed at 
americans in yemen mauritania bahrain the united arab emirates 
qatar and eastern saudi arabia it had recommended nonessential 
us personnel leave those countries as well 
meanwhile us sailors enforcing the un trade embargo boarded 
an iraqi ship near masirah island they were involved in a 
30minute melee with the crew and female peace activists from 10 
arab countries italy china the united states and japan 
a us navy spokesman cmdr mark neuhart said the trouble 
started when us sailors approached the pilot house of the 
freighter and a number of the crew attempted to hold the boarding 
party members back and grab their weapons 
the sailors fired warning shots a smoke grenade and a 
noisemaker grenade for crowd control he said there were no 
injuries he said 
the 11333ton ibn khaldoon carried 800 tons of sugar in 
violation of the un sanctions proiraqi arab news reports have 
dubbed the vessel the peace ship and said it was sailing to the 
iraqi port of basra in a demonstration of support for saddam and 
his initiatives for solving the gulf crisis 
the israeli newspaper said the jan 9 date for talks aimed at 
resolving the gulf crisis was set amid secret negotiations between 
the united states and iraq but a state department spokeswoman 
denied any date had been set 
diplomats in the region say saddam might be willing to make 
concessions if he can win linkage between resolution of the gulf 
crisis and efforts toward establishing palestinian selfrule in the 
israelioccupied territories 
the united states and its allies have rejected linking an iraqi 
pullout from occupied kuwait to the palestinian issue 
but maariv said a jan 9 bakersaddam meeting could be tied to 
plans by dennis ross director of the state departments policy 
planning staff to visit israel on jan 7 to discuss new middle 
east peace proposals 
the state department appears to be putting together a proposal 
for opening peace talks between israel and arab countries in tandem 
with holding municipal elections in the occupied territories the 
paper said

prompted federal authorities to exhume the body singer said 
he and other state and federal authorities have refused to

un secretarygeneral javier perez de 
cuellar may seek help from member nations consulates in israel to 
monitor the safety of palestinians in israelioccupied territories 
un officials said wednesday 
they said he was consulting through the interntional committee 
of the red cross about using the consular staff in israel of the 
164 nations that signed the 1949 fourth geneva convention on 
protecting civilians in occupied lands 
the security council told the secretarygeneral last thursday to 
discern the views of the signatory nations about a possible meeting 
to discuss implementing the geneva convention and helping 
palestinians 
signatories include the united states britain france canada 
and others 
perez de cuellar also is considering expanding the un relief 
and works agency which cares for palestinian refugees to observe 
and report on the palestinians situation in the gaza strip and 
west bank israel seized the territories in the 1967 mideast war 
the officials speaking on condition of anonymity said any 
change in the agencys mandate was unlikely in view of israeli and 
us opposition to expanding unrwas role 
they said no decisions have been made the un chief is on 
vacation until jan 4 
the security council resolution adopted unanimously asks the 
secretarygeneral to monitor and observe the situation in the 
occupied palestinian territories on an urgent basis using the 
united nations personnel stationed there and appointing the 
necessary staff to accomplish this task 
arab nations called it an important first step in council 
involvement to protect palestinians in the israelioccupied 
territories 
they say the council must act evenhandedly in opposing both 
iraqs occupation of kuwait and israels occupation of the 
territories by subjecting israel to economic and other sanctions 
like iraq 
perez de cuellar says he will send his personal emissary 
jeanclaude aime to study the situation but has yet to announce a 
trip 
he also accepted an israeli invitation to visit but no date was 
announced unrwa created in 1949 has 2300 staff in the region

private banks bankers and politicians then began to organize large 
rallies against the measre

irans spiritual leader on wednesday 
rejected the latest concessions of author salman rushdie saying 
his death sentence for offending moslems remains in effect 
rushdie issued a statement in london on monday embracing islam 
it stated that the author would not seek the printing of a 
paperback edition of his novel the satanic verses and would 
not allow its translation into any more languages 
the late ayatollah ruhollah khomeini irans leader called for 
rushdies death in february 1989 for allegedly defaming islam in 
his book 
in a statement carried by tehran radio irans spiritual leader 
ayatollah ali khamenei said wednesday the death sentence still 
stands 
god willing from now on no one will dare insult the great 
messenger of god and islamic sanctities khamenei said in the 
statement monitored in nicosia 
he said rushdies contention that he had not meant to cause 
offense would do him no good 
quoting khomeini he said that even if he rushdie repents 
and becomes the most pious muslim on earth there will be no change 
in this divine decree 
the satanic verses has sold 1 million copies it has been 
translated into 15 languages 
the radical daily newspaper jomhuri islami stressed that the 
death sentence is irrevocable and it called on rushdie to prepare 
to die 
if rushdies repentance and his return to islam are seen as a 
sign of his bravery naturally it is necessary that he shows 
greater bravery and prepares himself for death the 
farsilanguage newspaper said wednesday 
he will die anyway but he will be better off to choose his 
way to eternal salvation courageously before a son of islam fires 
the coup de grace it added 
the editorial was reported by irans official islamic republic 
news agency and monitored in cyprus 
rushdie has been in hiding since khomeini called for his death 
and tehran put a 1 million bounty on his head 
iran cut diplomatic ties with britain over the rushdie affair 
the ties were restored sept 27 after british officials publicly 
conceded the book had offended moslems and said the government had 
no wish to do so 
khamenei said wednesday that rushdies statement demonstrated 
that western arrogance has been forced to retreat step by step 
he added that the edict and the commitment of moslems around 
the world to implement it is showing its first results 
iranian president hashemi rafsanjani who has attempted 
gradually to rebuild irans ties with the west has not rescinded 
the death edict but his supporters have indicated they are willing 
to let the decree lapse

garry kasparov of the soviet union retained 
his title as world chess champion wednesday with a draw in the 22nd 
game defeating his longtime rival countryman anatoly karpov 
the pair ended the 22nd of the 24match chess championship 
series with a draw after 43 moves the halfpoint each player 
received put the 27yearold kasparov ahead 1210 allowing him to 
remain champion 
i was really nervous because i didnt know what to do whether 
to play for the win or draw kasparov said afterward then my 
life became much easier when i had the worse positions and i had 
to fight for the draw and i obliged 
though kasparov has clinched the title the two must play two 
more games to determine how the 3 million purse is split if there 
is a 1212 draw after 24 games the purse will be split evenly if 
kasparov gets another draw or win he gains 17 million 
kasparov won the title from karpov in 1985 at 22 he was the 
youngest champion in chess history he defended the crown by 
beating karpov in 1986 and 1987 
karpov had taken the championship in 1975 when american bobby 
fischer refused to defend the title he won in 1972 
kasparov playing white arrived promptly at the 5 pm 11 am 
edt wednesday the starting time at the palais des congres he 
fidgeted with his pieces awaiting the arrival of karpov then made 
his first move advancing his kings pawn before his rival 
entered 
the 39yearold challenger 10 minutes late made an identical 
first move 
they went into an opening known as the ruy lopez with the 
zaitsev variation seen before in the second fourth and 20th 
games kasparov won the second and the 20th using white 
but karpov playing aggressively pulled slightly ahead by the 
25th move and had two pawns well advanced before kasparov captured 
them 
by the 30th move kasparov had a pawn clear on the queens side 
of the board as well as three more pawns but black had a knight 
both players still had two bishops and their queens along with 
their kings 
the pair traded bishops and then on the 38th move karpov 
offered a queen exchange 
kasparov thought about it for 10 minutes and then moved his 
queen to put karpov in check 
karpov moved out of check but kasparov put karpov in check 
forcing a perpetual check situation 
karpov realizing the forced draw was the likely outcome looked 
at kasparov and shook hands implicitly offering the draw and 
giving kasparov the world title again 
kasparov showed little emotion talked over the game briefly 
with karpov and then smiled when being interviewed 
the two men who are known to dislike each other differ in 
temperment looks politics and playing style 
kasparov is talkative and flamboyant playing chess with 
creativity and decisiveness he is reformminded in his politics 
karpov is often protrayed as a colorless introvert who plays 
with surgical precision i have two loves karpov has said 
communism and chess 
normally chess is a battle between two individuals kasparov 
once said but in my case with karpov its a fight between two 
different mentalities in russia i identify him with the system 
ive been fighting 
the 22nd game had been delayed a week karpov had called a 
timeout saturday then the organizers called a technical timeout on 
christmas eve twice postponing the game 
kasparov rallied to beat karpov after committing what he called 
the worst blunder of my career during the first round of play 
in new york it occurred in the seventh game when kasparov 
misplayed a bishop and gave karpov an advantage that allowed the 
challenger to win and tie the series at 35 points each 
however kasparov won the previous three times he had white in 
the nine games in lyon karpov had only won twice in the 21 
previous games of the series 
the two soviet grandmasters had six draws in the french portion 
of the championship they drew 10 times in the 12 games played in 
new york between oct 8 and nov 7

former dutch colony the state department advised americans on 
wednesday not to travel to suriname and told us citizens in that 
small south american nation of 400000 people to stay indoors 
the foreign ministry in caracas venezuela said it would refuse 
to recognize surinames new military government and asked for a 
firm response to the bloodless coup on christmas eve that 
ousted president ramsewak shankar 
a report from paramaribo capital of suriname quoted shankar as 
saying he and his ministers were not under house arrest and that he 
had complete freedom of movement he was reached by telephone at 
his home late tuesday 
a newspaper editor in suriname leo morpurgo of the morning 
daily de ware tyd said on wednesday that the military has not 
restricted the press or civil rights since the overthrow 
venezuela emphasized however that the november 1987 elections 
that brought shankar to power in january 1988 expressed the free 
will and sovereignty of the surinamese people and said the coup 
must be condemned as as an intolerable violation of democracy 
this is a regression in the process of latin american 
democracy said a communique from the office of foreign minister 
reinaldo figueredo 
it demanded immediate restitution of the shankar government and 
said the international community should taken necessary 
measures to restore the president a first step might be foreign 
governments refusing to recognize the new suriname government a 
government source said speaking on condition of anonymity 
shankar was ousted in an uprising led by acting army chief cmdr 
ivan graanoogst who then pledged to hold elections within 100 days 
and relinquish power 
the army has not spelled out what motivated the coup but is 
expected to blame shankar for not restoring economic health 
the coup mastermind was thought to be lt col desi bouterse 
who resigned as army chief hours before shankar was toppled he and 
shankar have long feuded 
bouterse ruled suriname for eight years after seizing power in a 
1980 military coup and wielded considerable power even after 
shankars government was overwhelmingly elected three years ago 
surinamese citizens stayed home from work wednesday a regularly 
scheduled national holiday their only information about the coup 
came from radio and television newspapers there do not publish on 
christmas day or the day after 
the army leaders who seized power in suriname a georgiasized 
nation on south americas northeastern coast pledged allegiance to 
democratic principles they promised to govern in consultation with 
the elected national assembly until elections can be held 
the army is not bent on having and keeping power graanoogst 
said in a christmas day radio address he said a nonpolitical 
government cabinet would be appointed within a week 
graanoogst is chief of military police and no 2 in the military 
chain of command 
bouterse has not been seen or made any public statements since 
the coup 
it was not immediately clear how the coup might affect an 
insurgency that has crippled the mining of bauxite a major export 
used in producing aluminum the army opposed a peace agreement 
between guerrillas and the ousted government 
in the 1987 election shankars threeparty coalition the front 
for democracy and development easily defeated the militarybacked

the government wrongfully seized a rental 
building where tenants dealt drugs because the landlords were not 
allowed to defend themselves against the action an appeals court 
ruled wednesday 
the seizure was carried out under a federal civil forfeiture law 
that allows prosecutors to take property used for narcotics 
activity 
the 2nd us circuit court of appeals said a judge improperly 
approved the seizure based only on a finding that the owners 
harvey and helen lehrer were aware tenants dealt drugs in the 
brooklyn building 
the forfeiture law adopted by congress in 1988 includes a 
clause designed to protect landlords it states that the government 
cannot seize buildings if the owners can prove they had no 
knowledge of drug activity or that they made reasonable efforts 
to prevent illegal use of their property 
the court said the couple didnt get the chance to show they 
took steps to curtail drug activity 
the appeals court reversed an order approving the seizure and 
sent the case back to us district judge thomas platt to allow the 
lehrers to further defend themselves against the forfeiture 
in december 1988 drug enforcement administration agents raided 
the building and found heroin cocaine cash and drug 
paraphernalia after the raid the us attorneys office took 
steps to seize the building 
bernholtz said the building has been sealed and vacant since the 
raid

the economics staff of the federal trade 
commission said wednesday it again had urged the federal 
communications commission to abolish rules that keep broadcast 
television networks from owning program rerun rights 
the ftcs economics bureau first urged abolition of the rules in 
september it expanded its comments to include several proposed 
modifications of the financial interest and syndication rules 
which commonly are called finsyn 
one proposal would regulate negotiations between program 
producers and networks negotiations about which the economists 
said we do not find compelling reasons to adopt any of the 
proposed restrictions 
a proposal that would modify but not abolish the rules may 
lead to a result that is less desirable than either complete 
elimination or complete retention of the rules the bureau said 
our analysis of these options leads us to continue to believe 
that the best course for the fcc is to repeal completely the 
existing finsyn rules the bureau said 
the justice department also has said the rules should be 
eliminated 
the fcc plans to decide next year whether to keep junk or 
change the rules adopted 20 years ago when the broadcast networks 
had a much larger shae of the primetime viewing audience than 
they have today 
the rules permit the networks to own only the overseas rerun 
rights to the primetime shows they produce themselves and bar the 
networks from any financial interest in other primetime programs 
including any interest in offnetwork or syndicated showings 
the ftcs economics bureau comments frequently on proposed 
regulations of other federal agencies and state agencies generally 
urging views that would result in increased competition

president roh taewoo on thursday 
named a new prime minister and foreign minister and reshuffled 
eight other cabinet posts in a bid to spruce up his partys image 
before next years elections 
ro jaibong 54 a chief aide and former university professor 
was named to succeed prime minister kang younghoon who reportedly 
asked to retire from public life 
ro holds a doctorate in political science from new york 
university he would be expected to lead south koreas delegation 
in a fourth round of highlevel talks on easing tensions with 
longtime rival north korea scheduled for february 
the new foreign minister was career diplomat lee sangok the 
ambassador to switzerland and a former vice foreign minister 
cabinet changes were also made in trade and industry labor 
unification information sports transportation communications 
and education 
presidential spokesman lee soojung announced the shakeup at a 
news briefing thursday 
park sehjik chief of the seoul olympic committee that staged 
the successful 1988 summer olympic games was named mayor of seoul 
the changes were seen as an attempt by the governing democratic 
liberal party to spur public support before local elections to be 
held in 1991 
rohs fiveyear term ends in 1992 he has made dramatic progress 
in foreign relations by expanding seouls ties with socialist and 
former communist nations but support for his domestic policies is 
at an alltime low 
roh has changed the cabinet several times since taking office in 
february 1988 
on wednesday the agency for national security planning a 
government intelligence agency announced the arrest of 31 students 
on charges of forming a north koreandirected organization that 
sought to overthrow the government 
it said in a statement that more than 70 other members of the 
chamintong group were being sought and that the organization has 
about 800 members 
the agency said the goal of chamintong an acronym meaning 
independence democracy and unification was to form a unified 
korea by 1995 under the leadership of north koreas communist 
chief kim il sung it said the organization would resort to armed 
fighting if necessary 
the agency said investigations found that chamintong has 
manipulated the chondaehyop a dissident student alliance to stage 
antigovernment and antiamerican activities in the guise of 
seeking democratization 
the two koreas have been separated since 1945 and fought in the 
195053 korean war

the governments 1990 census figures awarded 
political clout to california and the south on wednesday and 
carried good news to republican presidential candidates for at 
least the rest of this century 
at the same time the numbers diminished the political strength 
of states in the northeast and midwest and set the stage for power 
struggles in every state except the six which now have only one 
congressional district each 
as a result of the census count congressional district lines 
will be redrawn in every state except those six and 19 
congressional seats will be shifted 
eight states will gain representation and power in congress 
thirteen will lose seats and clout 
california will be the chief gainer adding seven more 
congressional seats bringing its total to 52 florida will gain 
four going to 23 texas will gain three going to 30 and one 
additional seat in the house will go to five states arizona 
going to six georgia to 11 north carolina to 12 virginia to 
11 and washington to nine 
new york going down to 31 will lose three seats two seats 
will be lost by four states illinois going to 20 michigan to 
16 ohio to 19 and pennsylvania to 21 
eight states will lose one each iowa going to five kansas 
to four kentucky to six louisiana to seven massachusetts to 
10 montana to one new jersey to 13 and west virginia to 
three 
in presidential elections the figures make winning easier for 
republicans because states which the gop usually carries will gain 
votes in the electoral college while states which the democrats 
depend upon will have less importance 
a states number of votes in the electoral college equals the 
total of its congressmen and its two senators so in the 
presidential elections of 1992 and 1996 california which no 
democrat has carried in a presidential election since 1964 will 
have 54 of the 270 electoral votes a candidate needs to win the 
presidency or one out of five 
the other states with new electoral college importance are also 
in the west and sunbelt regions tending in recent years to go 
republican 
the political consequences advantage the republicans said 
stephen hess political analyst at the brookings institution a 
research organization the republican vote has tended to come 
more from the new west and the burgeoning sunbelt 
curtis gans director of the nonpartisan committee for the 
study of the american electorate disputed what he said was the 
widespread view of the census figures as a windfall for the 
republicans 
he said republicans will gain in congressional elections but 
only in the short run 
most states that gained seats did so because of growing hispanic 
populations gans said and hispanics of the class that is 
expanding the population in california florida new mexico and 
arizona tend to vote 21 democratic eventually thats going to 
tell probably within the next decade only in florida where 
cubanamericans favor conservative candidates can the republicans 
anticipate longterm gains he said 
redistricting battles will start soon in the 43 states which 
will have more than one representative in congress and they 
promise to be particularly painful in states which must eliminate 
seats held by incumbents 
in new york for example redistricting may mean that democratic 
reps charles schumer and stephen solarz both representing 
brooklyn will have to compete for a single seat in the game of 
musical chairs that a new census sets off every decade 
it is no coincidence hess said that both have built up 
campaign war chests in the milliondollar range anticipating a 
costly battle to stay in congress or perhaps a costly race for a 
post elsewhere perhaps the senate seat occupied by republican 
alfonse m damato 
the six states which have only one congressman and thus avoid 
redistricting are alaska delaware north dakota south dakota 
vermont and wyoming montana in losing a congressman in 1992 will 
join that list

a newspaper reporter who received copies of 
confidential fbi documents during the trial of nine organized crime 
figures said wednesday he knew who sent him the material and 
promised the source anonymity 
the us attorneys office in pittsburgh wants to recover the 
documents from two newspapers and three television stations so 
investigators can trace the leak 
initially six news outlets that received the documents were 
subpoenaed to give them to a federal grand jury the tribunereview 
of greensburg relinquished the documents 
attorneys for the pittsburgh press the pittsburgh postgazette 
and television stations kdka and wpxi filed motions to quash the 
subpoenas television station wtae also received the documents but 
did not join in the motions 
during a hearing postgazette reporter mike bucsko said he 
received the documents in the mail several weeks before other news 
organizations did bucsko said he knew the source and had promised 
anonymity 
assistant us attorney linda l kelly didnt ask bucsko to 
identify the source in court 
us district judge donald j lee took the matter under 
advisement and will rule later 
attorneys for the news organizations argued that relinquishing 
the documents could ultimately identify the source whether 
reporters know the source or not 
the government claims the documents known as fbi 302 reports 
have value as evidence prosecutors have said whoever mailed the 
documents could be prosecuted for obstruction of justice or 
contempt of court 
the reports were capsules of debriefings of federal witness 
marvin droznek the reports were among many shared by the 
government with defense attorneys in the trial of nine organized 
crime figures 
a jury oct 29 convicted reputed organized crime underbosses 
charles chucky porter louis f raucci and seven others of 
racketeering and related charges 
the convictions ended an eightweek trial that prosecutors 
called the largest ever involving organized crime figures in

the year was one of rampant homicides and 
violence in los angeles county but public tolerance of the 
bloodshed is even more troubling the sheriff said wednesday 
in the past sheriff sherman block said a homicide report would 
bring news media running to the scene 
now they call and ask is it a routine murder block 
said we have routine murders homicides become box scores 
like the baseball games there doesnt seem to be the level of 
outrage i think there should be at these events 
block called 1990 a year of pluses and minuses for his 
department the largest minus being the conviction of six deputy 
sheriffs on charges of skimming drug money but he said he was 
proud of the majority of honest people who make up his 
12000member department 
block said the years most troubling development was the 
explosion of gangrelated homicides responsible for pushing murder 
figures up 32 percent in areas of the county policed by the 
sheriffs department 
there were 158 gangrelated homicides within the sheriffs 
jurisdiction during the first 11 months of this year way up from 
104 during the same period last year and shattering the record of 
116 set for all of 1989 
the sheriff said a report that 22 people died violently over the 
christmas weekend was not unusual 
what troubles me is the apparent tolerance of violence that we 
have developed in this community block said

nancy cruzan was driving home from work 
when her 1963 rambler ran off the road she was found face down in 
a ditch and stopped breathing for about 15 minutes 
the accident left the vibrant young lover of children and 
animals in a vegetative state for nearly eight years and it 
produced a landmark righttodie ruling that allowed for ms 
cruzans death wednesday after her feeding tube was removed 
ms cruzan worked at a cheese plant at the time of the accident 
in 1983 for six months in 1978 she worked as a teachers aide at 
a school for deaf and blind children in joplin 
each day ms cruzan fed melissa a severely handicapped 
3yearold who suffered from an involuntary reflex that caused her 
to thrust out her tongue when food touched her mouth 
ms cruzan repeatedly had to stick a tube filled with food down 
the girls throat 
we agreed if we were ever in a car accident or impaired to the 
point of melissa we would not want to live like that a fellow 
teachers aide marianne smith recalled in court last month 
judge charles teel jr considered mrs smiths testimony and 
that of two other former coworkers when he granted the request of 
ms cruzans parents dec 14 and allowed her feeding tube to be 
withdrawn 
ms cruzan 33 died with her parents at her side in the 
missouri rehabilitation center 12 days after the tube was removed 
the accident that disabled ms cruzan occurred about 1 am jan

apparently took a curve too fast and her car overturned 
a state trooper found ms cruzan lying face down in a ditch she 
wasnt breathing paramedics got her breathing again but not 
before her brain had been deprived of oxygen for an estimated six 
to 20 minutes most probably for 12 to 14 minutes court records 
showed 
joe cruzan a construction worker remembered his daughter as 
mischievous 
she was always the clown but not a smart aleck and yet for 
all her orneriness she was just as cute as she could be he

iraqi president saddam hussein has told a 
television interviewer that israel is the prime mover behind the 
persian gulf crisis and as such would receive the first iraqi 
blow if war breaks out 
the remark was contained in an interview broadcast after 
midnight wednesday by the spanish private network tele 5 which 
earlier paraphrased saddams threat in a news release saddam spoke 
to the network saturday in baghdad 
saddam blamed the crisis on what he said were us attempts to 
preserve its international influence and on israels 
expansionist policies he also expressed surprise at the soviet 
unions position in the conflict deeming it irresponsible and 
unjust 
we consider that the responsibility for the problems for the 
arab conflicts falls on israel and the zionists it is they who 
have pushed bush into the deadend street in which he now finds 
himself he said referring toi president bush 
because of that and in the case we suffer an aggression we 
consider israel a participant in other words if we must suffer 
the first blow whether at the front or here in baghdad and 
whether or not israel participates directly in the aggression they 
will suffer the second in tel aviv 
saddam reiterated his position that no peaceful solution to the 
conflict can emerge unless steps are taken to provide palestinians 
with a homeland 
for us the arabs the palestinian cause is the main issue 
the central axis of our struggle he said 
he said the iraqi people do not give the slightest 
importance to the united nations jan 15 deadline for iraqi 
troops to leave kuwait although he said iraq was suffering under 
the unsponsored embargo 
the un security council authorized the use of force by us 
and allied troops if iraq fails to withdraw from kuwait which it 
invaded aug 2 and later annexed 
he said iraq was ready to fight but left open the door to 
dialogue 
we advocate peace and dialogue but if others want war and 
aggression we are decided to crush that aggression saddam 
said we are not worried by threats the most fundamental thing 
for us is to preserve our spiritual integrity our dignity and 
our sovereignty 
he said soviet foreign minister eduard shevardnadzes 
resignation last week showed that many soviets opposed the 
governments decision to back the unsponsored embargo against 
iraq 
shevardnadze danced to us secretary of state james bakers 
tune and he didnt have a clearly defined point of view in any 
case whether it was shevardnadze or someone else who was 
responsible for soviet foreign policy the soviet posture is 
neither just nor responsible the iraqi leader said 
saddam said the united states sent troops to the gulf to 
preserve power after the end of the cold war 
the decline of the soviet union has made the united states the 
only superpower in the world the united states needs to control 
middle east petroleum to keep excercising influence over europe 
japan and probably in a later phase over the soviet union he 
said 
saddam said arab leaders lined up against iraq in the conflict 
were not heeding their peoples will 
we want to see the heads roll of aggressors and traitors and 
we also want the decline of leaders who preach injustice and 
practice aggression he said

the faithful who gathered at holy family roman 
catholic church hoped it wouldnt be the last christmas celebrated 
in the deteriorating church one of the few buildings to survive 
the great chicago fire of 1871 
parishioners need to raise 125000 more by new years eve to 
save the 130yearold victorian gothic church said dick barry a 
spokesman for the holy family preservation society 
were going to make our goal the rev george lane said 
monday our motto is say prayers and send money 
about 20 parishioners braved 10degree temperatures to gather on 
the church steps wednesday night for the first candlelight rosary 
service to be held one hour a day for five days 
the society of jesus which owns the church has threatened to 
tear it down and sell the property unless the parish can raise 1 
million of a 3 million repair bill by the deadline 
construction on the church began in 1857 by 1860 it was the 
thirdlargest church in the united states its 226foot bell tower 
was the tallest structure in chicago and its stained glass windows 
were the first installed in the city 
when fire broke out in october 1871 and devastated the city 
holy family only five blocks from where the fire began was 
unharmed it was one of only five public buildings spared by the 
fire 
the rev arnold damen jesuit founder of the parish vowed 
that if the church was spared seven lights would burn perpetually 
at the churchs shrine to our lady of perpetual help lane said 
the seven lights now electrified still burn in the church 
today even though the main section of the building has been closed 
for six years 
the congregation has been using the side chapel since falling 
plaster made the main room unusable but the main nave is still 
structurally sound and seats more than 1200 so church officials 
would like to reopen it after repairs 
barry said the church needs repairs to its slate roof and its 
copper sheeting as well as work on its downspouts and interior 
plaster 
the first 1 million would go for that and wed use the rest 
for less urgent things like renovating the interior and adding 
modern improvements he said 
barry said generous former parishioners and alumni of the 
adjoining st ignatius college prep one of the citys oldest and 
most prestigious roman catholic high schools helped them near 
their goal 
one auto dealer from the suburbs a graduate of st ignatius 
gave us 50000 last week he said another graduate who has a 
large italian restaurant threw banquets for us and gave us all the 
proceeds 
if the parish makes the deadline for raising the first 1 
million it then will have some breathing room to come up with the 
rest of the money 
barry said the jesuits have pledged a 750000 maintenance fund 
and a union has offered to do 50000 worth of electrical work for 
free

the us population stood at 249632692 as of 
the 1990 census the government said wednesday in a numerical 
portrait of a nation growing far more rapidly in the sun belt than 
in the industrial north and agricultural heartland 
california the nations largest state added more than 6 
million people in the decade a 261 percent increase to 29839250 
people 
wyoming remained the smallest state with 455975 people down 
29 percent from 1980 
nevada was the biggest population gainer in percentage terms 
and florida and arizona each grew by more than onethird as 
millions of americans flocked to the sunshine 
west virginia was the largest loser in percentage terms 
in all the population increased by 102 percent from the 
226504825 people counted in the 1980 census below the 114 
percent population growth recorded from 1970 to 1980 and the 134 
percent rate from 1960 to 1970 
the information was contained in the census bureaus first 
release of final figures really tentative final figures 
from the 1990 count the information will be used for everything 
from readjusting the size of each states congressional delegation 
to parcelling out federal aid 
in political terms the population shifts will give california 
seven new house seats and add lawmakers to seven other states 
thirteen states will lose representation 
because of the importance of the population estimates some 
states and cities are likely to challenge the tallies and a final 
count isnt expected until next summer 
the cost of the 1990 census from planning begun in 1984 to a 
final release of data in 1993 is estimated at 26 billion by the 
bureau 
still locked in census bureau computers to be doled out over 
the next several years is a wealth of information about age 
race living conditions and other details of america near the turn 
of the century 
besides wyoming four other states lost population the biggest 
percentage loser was west virginia whose population dropped by 76 
percent to 1801625 other states losing population were iowa 
down 43 percent and and north dakota down 17 percent the 
district of columbia also lost population 45 percent 
the sharpest gainer in percentage terms was nevada that states 
population grew by 507 percent to 1206152 besides california 
other states with gains of more than 25 percent were florida up 
334 percent arizona up 353 percent and alaska up 374 
percent 
the pacific states were the fastest growing region 234 
percent followed by the mountain states 206 percent and the 
south atlantic states 188 percent by contrast the east north 
central states grew a bare 11 percent and the west north central 
states 31 percent 
some regions went against the broader trend new england which 
had a boom in hightech industry during the 1980s grew by 72 
percent the east south central states grew only 39 percent 
because of the high financial and political stakes the census 
numbers and the way they were obtained are certain to draw 
continued sharp scrutiny 
more than 6000 local governments challenged the accuracy of a 
preliminary count based mainly on the april 1 census taken by mail 
the census bureau responded with a series of recounts and an ad 
campaign urging people who thought they had been missed to come 
forward 
the final national population total was nearly 4 million people 
more than the preliminary number released by the bureau earlier 
this year 
commerce secretary robert mosbacher has until july 1991 to 
decide whether to adjust the census numbers to account for a 
statistically determined undercount of minorities an adjustment 
would increase political representation of areas with a high 
percentage of minorities and lower that of other areas 
california will gain seven seats giving it 52 in the 435member 
house florida will gain four texas three and arizona georgia 
north carolina virginia and washington one seat each 
new york will lose three seats illinois michigan ohio and 
pennsylvania two seats each and iowa kansas kentucky 
louisiana massachusetts montana new jersey and west virginia 
one seat each 
the 1990 census for the first time counted some americans living 
abroad the total included 922819 members of the armed forces 
civilian employees of the federal government and their dependents 
the comparable numbers from 10 years earlier counted only people 
living within the united states 
the census bureau on wednesday released two sets of 1980 
numbers the 226504825 figure used by the bureau for comparison 
with the 1990 national total was released in december 1980 but was 
later adjusted slightly to get rid of minor problems the adjusted 
figure was 226545805 
the 1990 population count was nearly 64 times the 3929214 
counted in 1790 the first census in the nations history by 1900 
the population had reached 76212168 
in 1950 the first census after world war ii the population was 
151325798 
in january the census bureau will begin sending information on 
small areas in some cases the size of a city block to state 
legislatures so they can begin drawing new congressional and 
legislative boundaries 
that process will be completed by april 1 
the bureau will put off releasing detailed demographic data 
until after the decision on adjusting the figures

iraqs invasion of kuwait and the heartstopping standoff that 
ensued in the persian gulf was by far the top news story of 1990 
according to a poll of associated press news editors and broadcast 
news directors 
the gulf crisis received 2506 points to finish well ahead of 
the news story that placed second the reunification of germany 
that story got 1460 points in voting by 327 editors and news 
directors 
the no 3 story also unfolded abroad the economic and 
political reforms that have racked the soviet union 
the first domestic story to make the list was the continuing 
savings and loan debacle which finished fourth 
finishing fifth was the warming of relations between the two 
superpowers followed by congress difficulties with the 1991 
budget americas economic downturn developments in eastern 
europe panama president manuel noriegas surrender and 
preparations to prosecute him and the end of the margaret thatcher 
era in britain 
the top 10 stories 
1 when saddam husseins iraqi troops overran the tiny emirate 
of kuwait in the predawn hours of aug 2 they set in motion a 
dizzying sequence of dangerous events a united nationsordered 
embargo against iraq a buildup of american and other forces in the 
region the taking of foreign hostages as human shields for iraqi 
military sites and their later release 
by septembers end the price of oil reached 40 a barrel 
nearly double what it had been before the invasion 
on nov 29 the un security council voted to give iraq until 
jan 15 to pull out of kuwait or face a possible military strike 
the world is waiting 
2 east and west germany became one nation again on oct 3 
ending a division that began at the end of world war ii 
reunification had been an impossible dream just a year before 
but that was before east german protests for democratic freedoms at 
the end of 1989 brought down berlin wall since 1961 the cold wars 
most palpable symbol 
free elections were held in east germany in the spring of 1990 
and the communists were sent packing the soviet union accepted 
nato membership for the united germany removing the last serious 
obstacle 
3 soviet president mikhail gorbachevs ambitious program of 
economic and political reforms foundered in 1990 although 
gorbachev won a new fiveyear term as president and tightened his 
control over the communist party his nation was torn apart by 
ethnic unrest rebellious republics disgruntled hardliners and 
shortages of bread sugar meat cigarettes and other goods 
4 the sampl mess got messier in 1990 and the tab to us 
taxpayers was revised upwards to 500 billion over 30 years the 2 
billion failure of charles keating jrs lincoln savings and loan 
the biggest bailout yet came to symbolize the troubles of hundreds 
of thrifts 
keating who faces federal fraud charges accusing him of 
misleading investors on the safety of junk bonds made 13 million 
in political contributions to five senators who intervened on his 
behalf with thrift regulators the senate ethics committee held 
hearings on the five donald w riegle jr dmich alan cranston 
dcalif john mccain rariz john glenn dohio and dennis 
deconcini dariz 
a federal judge found the presidents son neil guilty of 
conflict of interest for failing to disclose business ties with 
developers in his role as director of the failed silverado banking 
savings and loan association 
5 gorbachev may have faced mounting headaches at home but 
relations with the united states were never warmer bush and 
gorbachev who won the nobel peace prize for easing international 
tensions met three times during the year the first meeting was in 
washington to sign chemical weapons agreements the second was a 
oneday summit in helsinki finland to discuss the persian gulf 
crisis 
the third meeting was in paris in november for the 34nation 
conference on security and cooperation in europe its highlight was 
the signing of a farreaching conventional arms control agreement 
by leaders of north atlantic treaty organization countries and 
warsaw pact nations 
6 after five months of sometimes acrimonious negotiations 
congress and bush cobbled together a 1991 budget package in 
october in addition to spending cuts the 250 billion deficit 
reduction package provided for tax increases belying the 
presidents most popular pledge read my lips no new taxes 
republicans campaigning for reelection felt betrayed 
7 bush said the nations economy was in a serious slowdown 
federal reserve chairman alan greenspan used the phrase 
meaningful downturn but virtually everybody else was calling 
what was happening in the last half of 1990 a recession 
the statistics were mostly bad novembers unemployment rate 
jumped to a threeyear high of 59 percent singlefamily housing 
starts fell to levels unmatched since the 198182 recession the 
october trade deficit took an unexpected leap to 116 billion in 
october the worst monthly trade gap in 2 years the dow jones 
industrial average which had flirted with 3000 in july was some 
400 points lower in december 
in a bid to stimulate the economy the fed cut its discount rate 
the interest it charges on loans to member banks for the first 
time since 1986 
8 soviet troops began pulling out of poland czechoslovakia 
hungary and east germany after noncommunist governments came to 
power in those nations for the first time since world war ii but 
economic difficulties and ethnic tensions kept under wraps during 
communist rule flared under looser regimes and threatened the 
fledgling democracies 
in poland solidarity chairman lech walesa was elected president 
in a landslide victory in december 
romanians clashed with hungarians in disputed areas of romania 
and separatist demands threatened to dissolve yugoslavia in 
albania the last bastion of stalinist rule the government 
formally recognized the first opposition party in decades and 
scheduled elections for early 1991 the same week more than 150 
people were tried for antigovernment acts after protesters burned 
and ransacked buildings in four provinces 
9 on jan 3 panamanian president manuel noriega stepped out of 
the vatican mission where he had taken refuge and surrendered to 
us authorities he was brought to florida and charged with 
accepting 46 million in bribes to turn panama into a way station

noriega had been scheduled to go to trial this january but his

on his deathbed at georgetown hospital 
behind the closed door of room c6316 central intelligence agency 
director william j casey whispered two words 
washington post investigative legend bob woodward according to 
his own account was bent over the dying chief asking if and why 
casey had participated in the irancontra scandal 
i believed casey replied 
so too apparently did the executive producers of a new abc 
series about the cia called under cover debuting jan 7 
belief in what however like caseys cryptic answer is not 
really clear 
that cia agents are not all evil spies plotting to overthrow 
banana republics in farflung corners of the world that like john 
q public said agents are fathers mothers little league 
supporters and also concerned about the office dental plan 
thats part of it left to the imagination in the twohour pilot 
of under cover is why its characters do what they do and if 
they truly believe in the agency they work for 
coexecutive producer william broyles jr former editor in 
chief of newsweek founding editor of texas monthly vietnam 
veteran and cocreator of abcs china beach said the lead 
characters of under cover are trying to do the right thing in 
a sometimes difficult and unethical situation 
these agents like soldiers are often the foot soldiers of 
agents and policies that they disagree with broyles said in a 
recent interview at his warner bros office 
the makers of under cover find themselves in a somewhat 
similar and awkward position it is broyles and john sacret young 
who created the new series as well as china beach 
and it is china beach that under cover is replacing 
theres an irony in it thats certainly not lost on me said 
broyles 
the acclaimed vietnam war series china beach is going on 
hiatus the victim of three different time period changes in as 
many seasons and a drop in viewership 
whether china beach will be renewed is doubtful 
young is equally doubtful about the success of under cover 
i cant imagine that it will succeed he said 
the reason being its time period of 9 pm saturdays an hour 
not known for attracting huge numbers of network viewers many of 
those who do tune in are watching nbcs successful golden girls 
comedy series 
young calls under cover a program about how a man thinks 
hes doing a job and its really affecting his life whats 
happening is getting under the skin 
international espionage will do that to a person especially 
when bullets needles and torture are involved 
you dont want to whitewash the cia young said you tread 
a fine line which creates a horrible and horrid situation 
imagine the series story meetings what to do about the cias 
historic involvement in foreign affairs chile for example fidel 
castro mining nicaraguan harbors the troublesome problem of 
overthrowing foreign leaders deemed to be unfriendly 
the story line of under cover concerns husbandandwife spy 
team dylan and kate delamico anthony john denison and linda purl 
who are anxious to put down roots live in the suburbs go to 
little league games and otherwise live the american dream 
wife kate soured on the company a while back and no longer 
spies husband dylan while professing his desire for an agency 
desk job ends up in the soviet union on a mission to save glasnost 
and becomes part of a convoluted doubleagent scenario that leaves 
certain members of the agency unsure of whether dylan works for 
them or the kgb 
meanwhile back at the agency the yuppies are threatening to 
take over with their flyover satellite pictures and 
technologydriven spying 
dylan and kates boss stewart merriman runs around imparting 
words of wisdom such as were the only thing between order and 
chaos and in our business things are not always what they 
seem 
he should try dropping in on twin peaks the bizarre 
nighttime soap opera that follows under cover 
over there theyve got this gauntlooking giant who appears in 
visions and says the owls are not what they seem 
 
elsewhere in television 
tv and just say no the academy of television arts amp sciences 
has arranged for 15 public service announcements denouncing 
substance abuse to be broadcast nationwide in 1991 the spots 
represent prize winners in the academys annual campaign against 
substance abuse filmvideo college competition

in increasing numbers american consumers are 
shunning the glittery malls and choosing to shop in huge drab 
buildings where service is almost a missing element 
but prices are lower in warehouse purchasing clubs the stocks 
are huge and the economy is in the doldrums the combination is 
proving irresistible people will put up with a lot for a bargain 
so many people are willing to pay the 25 membership fee that 
entitles them to go to the warehouse clubs and purchase everything 
from luggage to lettuce in a single trip 
the service isnt great says marlene green of randallstown 
md interviewed during a shopping trip in a warehouse club outside 
of washington but ive shopped at the warehouse for so long im 
a veteran i generally know where everything is and once you can 
figure that out its easy 
the prices are so low that im willing to trade service to 
save money 
charles steinbreuck president and chief executive officer of 
the pace membership warehouse chain based in englewood colo says 
one reason for the success of the format is that consumers are 
tired of paying hidden costs of dealing with major retailers 
lower overhead costs and not having to pay for mass media 
advertising campaigns allows us competitive advantages over 
traditional retailers he says 
by doing direct mailings to our individual members and the 
small businesses we serve theres no need to pass along to 
consumers the costs of trying to appeal to the masses 
gerry warren of piscataway md who joined pace in 1985 says 
he sees the difference in the nearly wholesale prices offered by 
the warehouses as compared to shopping at grocery store chains 
this really surprised me the quality of the merchandise 
offered by the warehouse i thought it was going to be one of those 
deals where cheap stuff is just marked down to get rid of it he 
says 
but i can tell you the quality is as good or better than i 
can get elsewhere and its saved me a lot of money in the past 
five years 
sandra shaber an economist with the futures group in 
washington says when the nations economy goes into a decline no 
matter how brief consumers go where they can get the most for 
their money 
when the economy gets soft usually consumers are willing to 
trade down in price as long as theres not much of a drop in 
quality ms shaber says 
you cant just be cheap you have to have something of value 
to offer you have to have popular products available the 
warehouse has to have a neat professional appearance and it has to 
be convenient she said 
sonyia soper a shopper at the pace warehouse in laurel md 
says she first shopped at the outlet last year and now makes the 
majority of her purchases there 
the prices are the main inducement i can buy more for 
less money than going around the corner to laurel centre mall they 
have to pay for all of the glitz associated with being in a mall 
and who gets stuck with the bill you shoppers do she says 
pace opened its first warehouse store in denver in 1983 and 
currently has 62 outlets nationwide it has 3 million members who 
are charged 25 annually and serves about 800000 small 
businesses 
the company a wholly owned subsidiary of the kmart corp will 
do a projected 25 bilion in sales this year 
pace and the san diego califbased price club whose 
membership dues are also 25 a year are the frontrunners in the 
effort to capture dollars that are usually spent at supermarkets 
department stores and specialty shops 
the popularity of the warehouse stores which started in the 
west is rapidly spreading to the heavily industrialized northeast 
ms shaber says since that is where the nationwide economic 
slowdown is being most severely felt warehouse stores are 
targeting the region for growth 
whenever and wherever money gets tight consumers look for an 
alternative to mainstream markets for goods and services she 
says 
were seeing the backlash from the early 1980s when brand 
names were so strong that they squeezed out generic brands from the 
marketplace that cycle has run its course and people now want more 
purchasing power for their money 
sales at the warehouse clubs have increased substantially in the 
past six years prices are usually 20 percent to 40 percent below 
what is charged by traditional retailers 
costs are lower because of the size of the stores usually about 
100000 square feet because they do not permit credit card 
purchases and they offer minimal customer assistance 
steinbreuck says the economic downturn is a factor in the recent 
popularity of the warehouse stores another is their convenience 
we sell food fresh and frozen and meats we sell electronic 
equipment and appliances we sell automotive supplies we offer 
something that most retailers lack the ability to offer several 
different categories of merchandise in one location which means 
that our customers can shop at their leisure and save gasoline

some people who claim to know how free markets 
work are doing things that make you wonder such as raising their 
rates in an attempt to offset declines in business 
basic economics texts say that to do so is the road to ruin but 
dont try telling that to bankers and many other financial 
institutions executives who already have decided to put the theory 
through another test 
they wouldnt be the first to try for years automobile 
companies tried to cover higher costs by higher prices only to be 
forced by lagging sales into rebating some of the increases the 
steel industry tried it before them 
the wall street journal recently suggested that higher costs 
were behind its 50 percent price increase drawing from fortune 
magazine a commentary on the importance of reading the journals 
own freemarket editorials but the journal isnt the only 
publication by a long shot that is taking the higher price course 
its happening throughout the country 
with business falling you might think that financial 
institutions might consider lowering some fees for services but 
throughout the industry there are plans to raise them instead 
citibank raised several fees 25 percent or more 
savings institutions are working their way through an absolute 
financial debacle one that has swallowed up hundreds of outlets 
and scared away customers of many who survive but they too are 
doing it 
instituting or increasing fees for services can better define 
relationships with customers according to savings 
institutions published for members of the us league of savings 
institutions 
according to an article to boost fee income adds up in 
dollars and sense traditional fees involve services such as 
safedeposit boxes checks returned for insufficient funds 
stoppayment requests money transfers 
fees for many of these are sure to go up but it is likely that 
some notsocommon fees also will head in that direction in 
addition you may find that local branch managers will less apt to 
waive fees 
that latter practice says michael wilson a researcher for the 
league is often a key factor in the poor performance of some 
branches in the new thinking imposition of the fees may rid the 
branch of unprofitable customers 
the savings institutions article describes what it indicates 
is a highly profitable moneyraiser used by one bank it circulates 
a magazine to bigbalance customers and sells advertising in it 
thats not all 
more important it says is the real gravy which comes in 
the form of commissions paid by a travel agency on every cruise 
advertised in the magazine and booked by a bank customer 
will such practices work theoretically they arent likely to 
succeed over a long period of time if customers feel the services 
offered arent worth the price or are available at a better price 
from a competing institution 
however in a crisis and that is how many in the business view 
their condition they may help an institution to survive 
securities brokers did it you may recall and they survived for a 
while but with institutional business declining many are 
rethinking policies and seeking to attract individuals 
one of the key questions of course is whether the institutions 
will offer improved services or simply try to squeeze more money 
out of the existing level of service or perhaps even allow it to 
decline 
customers reaction will have something to say about it too will 
customers better appreciate the services offered when they have to 
pay for them or as could very well happen will they tend to feel 
exploited 
if you continue to believe that the laws of the market place of 
supply and demand havent been rescinded then you must still 
believe the practices may be a shortterm phenomenon and that 
price competition will return

the 1991 toyota tercel 2door deluxe is not your basic econobox 
it has a remarkaby smoothshifting fivespeed manual 
transmission 
it has contemporary rounded exterior styling and clean modern 
interior 
and it doesnt have a hatchback sibling for 1991 toyota 
eliminated the hatchback design thats standard fare at the low end 
of the car market and decided to offer the tercel in upscale 2and 
4door sedan models that have trunks 
we want to keep toyota buyers for the long haul so we dont 
punish them in their first experience with us said bob mccurry 
toyota executive vice president 
the tercels starting price of 6488 also is noteworthy its 
unchanged from the previous model year and makes the new tercel the 
lowest price car with a trunk in america it compares with the 
6995 honda civic 3door the 7999 nissan sentra and the 6597 
daihatsu charade 3door 
the aps test tercel a 2door with a base price of 7798 
performed well it wasnt a barn burner what with its 15liter 
inline 12valve fourcylinder engine capable of producing 82 
horsepower at 5200 rpm i also had to really push the clutch to 
the floor so the key would activate the ignition 
but the car does accelerate faster than the previous tercel 
model and the fuel economy of 29 miles per gallon in the city and 
35 mpg on the highway was appreciated it was a pleasure too to 
note the fine mating of the transmission with the engine i rarely 
felt a jerk as i shifted gears 
there was some road noise but not as much as might be expected 
toyota added extra sounddeadening material thats also used on the 
camry and worked to minimize vibration 
the cars suspension macpherson strut in front and a torsion 
beam in back was decent and took bumps and turns quite well 
fit and finish were superb toyota has reduced the size of body 
panel gaps on the exterior 
the interior was spartan though not necessarily cheaplooking 
ventilation ducts were modern and round and could be turned easily 
and directed for maximum effect gauges were large and easy to 
read 
as expected the cars equipment was basic the vehicle did not 
have power windows power locks a clock tilt steering or a remote 
trunk lid release and the rear windows do not open the trunk 
floor had a vinyl cover but there was nothing to cover the bare 
metal on the interior trunk sides 
the floor mats were a 55 option and power steering a real 
help in tight turns in parking lots cost 250 
the car had seat belts for five but the middle person in back 
sits up quite high on an awkward though cushioned resting spot 
i was glad to see that legroom in back was ok if the front seats 
are up a ways but my knees were pushed into the seatbacks when the 
seats were all the way back on their tracks toyota said the new 
tercel has 9 percent more interior space than its predecessor with 
an average of 1 inch added to each interior dimension 
the automaker looks to sell 130000 of the 1991 tercels which 
were introduced in november that would be up from approximately 
100000 for the 1990 model tercel 
the tercel has been in the united states since 1980 and has 
averaged about 100000 sales a year spokesman jim fewel said 
tercel buyers traditionally have been young single and female 
seventy percent of tercel buyers are women with a median age of 
31 fewel said thirtyfive percent are married and 54 percent are 
college graduates median income is in the upper 20000s he said 
with the exception of the 1987 model tercels have ranked better 
than average or much better than average since the 1984 model year 
according to consumer reports magazines trouble reports from 
owners the 1987 tercel ranked average

christian broadcaster pat robertson now off the 
campaign trail but still plugging for believers engagement with 
political issues worries the persian gulf crisis could be turned 
against israel 
he says iraqi leader saddam hussein has set the machinery in 
motion by which a world military alliance and arab nations 
eventually might isolate israel and spark cataclysmic events 
if tha happens it would bring some heavenly intervention to 
protect israel robertson said in an interview certainly 
events are marching in that direction and very rapidly 
he doesnt offer any timetable or specific scenario for such 
convulsions as do some endoftime sifters of biblical clues but 
as a firm backer of israels nationhood he does see hints of it in 
the present turmoil 
robertson in a wideranging conversation also foresaw a 
sharpening struggle for the pinacles of power in this country 
in government the courts schools and news media and predicted 
religious values would regain ascendancy 
its a multifaceted struggle but the people of faith are 
going to prevail he said a profound spiritual awakening is 
coming in this country in this decade 
he elaborates his views in a new book the new millennium 
published by word publishing of irving texas and it foresees a 
conflict between secularism and judeochristian standards 
similar themes threaded his unsuccessful 1988 campaign for the 
republican presidential nomination and he said that campaign 
accomplished a goal even though he didnt win 
my main purpose was not to see me elected but to get 
christians involved in the public arena and in politics and 
theyre in there he said 
i found there is an enormous reservoir of profamily 
prochristian values in this country these people are in it for 
the long haul within the next 10 years they may be the most 
powerful political force in america 
robertson 60 is back as president of his financially rebounded 
christian broadcasting network and chancellor of its affiliated 
graduate school regent university at virginia beach va 
he brushes aside the idea of another presidential bid 
chuckling he said im so glad that bush got handed the deficit 
the savingsandloan crisis and the middle east i dont know what 
to do 
he said he has no plans whatever to run again but earlier 
this year he set up a national votereducation organization the 
christian coalition to alert grassroots supporters to issues 
it has about 50000 participants so far he said theyre 
going to make a big contribution theyre capable intelligent and 
make tremendous political operatives when they care to do so itll 
be for the good of the country 
in his book he predicts that in this decade a fierce 
intense and sometimes ugly battle is going to be waged to seize the 
control points of society away from the forces of antichristian 
secularism 
after a period of intense struggle the believers will stand 
firmly astride the fallen and crumbling ruins of the secular 
colossus he says 
he also predicts that we are entering the age of the 
supernatural a colliding amalgam of all sorts of cults esoteric 
lords and masters new age counterfeits followers of the 
occult and even satanism 
but he says these will be countered by a groundswell of 
christian renewal all over the world that will reverse 
smothering irreligious secularism 
he sharply criticizes the courts saying they have legislated 
judeochristian values out of american life and the educational 
system saying it has caused the dumbing of america 
generations have been so well trained to be so open minded 
their minds are essentially empty he writes 
antireligious attitudes dominate the movies television and 
print media he says but like communism he says secular 
humanism has failed it is a bankrupt system without moral 
guidelines or reliable safeguards to protect the people from its 
own corruptions 
robertson stressed similar points in the interview he said the 
religious nonestablishment clause in the constitution has been 
used for the establishment of everything else chiefly a 
secularistic religion that excludes judeochristianity 
he blames the abandonment of americas religious roots for the 
most serious problems of the country drug abuse crime child 
abuse wife battering the deficit and financial scandals 
its like taking the foundation from under a skyscraper the 
whole thing comes tumbling down he said 
robertson relaxed warm with his ready smile keeps in shape 
jogging playing tennis and horseback riding a onetime golden 
gloves boxer he took time out this fall at the invitation of boxer 
evander holyfield to see him win the worlds heavyweight boxing 
championship in las vegas 
hes kept busy administering operations with revenues of 90 
million a year 70 million of it in donations up from a low of 
58 million in 1988 and more than 1100 employees he also is host 
of cbns centerpiece 90minute talk show the 700 club which 
is carried on 223 tv stations and cable systems reaching 52 million 
households 
people are saying lets get back to our roots he said 
weve got to get back to our judeochristian principles and 
restore the values that weve given up then weve got to roll up 
our sleeves and go to work to start rebuilding this country and the 
world

betty carter has been bopping around as a jazz 
singer for 42 years but she isnt tired of it 
performing live brings something out of you that the recording 
studio doesnt she says 
in fact her new album droppin things on verve records 
was recorded live at the bottom line here on two nights in may her 
last album look what i got won a grammy award for best 
female jazz vocal performance in 1988 
carter 60 feels its important for a singer to work with new 
material and not get locked into an unchanging repertoire 
why him is an alan jay lerner song i heard when they were 
giving him a tribute on tv i decided to find the lyrics and do the 
song she said of her new album thirty years is a brandnew 
song droppin things is very new open the door i recorded 
before but never like this she wrote those three 
one of the tracks on the album is star dust combined with 
memories of you but carter said i never sang star dust 
before i only sang memories once or twice 
carter is known for daring improvisations and unusual approaches 
to songs the more you do a song the more you learn about the 
tune and your concept of the tune then im free then i just go 
any way i want to go and can go with it musically she said 
but she decided not to play around too much on the new album 
at least you can recognize it she said most people want to 
recognize star dust 
carter is backed up by marc cary on piano duane burno on bass 
and gregory hutchinson on drums theyre 20 20 and 23 she 
said my musicians are getting younger and younger maybe 15 
years ago i had a hard time finding musicians now there are a lot 
of them out there who want to play acoustic instruments and work 
with me 
they went to japan in october returned for some american gigs 
in november and probably will spend much of next year in europe 
i love performing i know how spontaneous it is for me to do my 
work working keeps me alive carter said 
a snatch of conversation overheard on the radio led her to 
rework the lyrics for jumps a song she wrote 12 years ago her 
trio liked jumps so when they went to europe in march she 
worked on more lyrics 
the music was very abstract she said once these young 
kids showed me their enthusiasm for the tune i said ok im going 
to develop it id tried it with other musicians they shrugged 
their shoulders i find these kids younger than my two sons will 
try anything 
i start doodling at the piano in front of my trio if they 
say whats that i know its time to develop the tune i ask 
them for their input also it makes them part of the material 
which keeps it young and different 
carter credits wynton marsalis with inspiring a lot of young 
players to come out and take a chance 
she said young performers are increasingly turning to material 
i thought i never would hear again old thelonious monk charlie 
parker dizzy gillespie tunes but carter doesnt want to keep 
listening to those recreations 
i keep telling them learn all the songs we played in those 
days know all the changes lock it up in the brain and go for 
something else sit and learn all the standards theyre 
interesting its very educational to learn the blues in all kinds 
of keys learn how to transpose 
dont listen too long to some one artist get in the habit of 
being creative early for the rest of your life you could come up 
with something different than anyone has ever done it could 
happen there are 88 keys and all kinds of changes to experiment 
with a voice can do a lot of wonderful things 
only time is going to make young musicians understand what im 
talking about i wouldnt pay anybody any attention either in my 
young age at least they get some information in the very 
beginning some that dont take advantage of it instantly will 
catch it later

in his first opinion as a federal appeals 
judge a raymond randolph ruled against the administration that 
had just chosen him 
a conservative washington attorney nominated to the us circuit 
court of appeals by president bush earlier this year randolph 
rejected an administration argument that a board set up to regulate 
government nuclear weapons plants could meet secretly despite the 
freedom of information act 
his stinging opinion issued in october was joined by two 
conservative appointees of president reagan james l buckley and 
douglas h ginsburg 
between them bush and reagan have appointed more than 500 
federal judges over the past decade there are 34 vacancies now 
and bush recently signed a law creating 85 new judgeships around 
the country bringing the total number of federal trial and appeals 
judges to 828 
those appointments have established the dominance of 
conservatives on the federal bench but as the randolph ruling 
illustrates judges named for life are independent of the 
administrations that send them to the bench 
and legal scholars say the impact of ideology is overstated by 
lobbying groups involved in senate confirmation proceedings on 
federal district and circuit court judges 
the fact of the matter is there isnt much leeway on the part 
of courts below the supreme court said philip b kurland a 
constitutional law professor at the university of chicago the 
troops follow the direction of the commanding officers they go 
where they are told to and there are few mutineers in their 
ranks 
there has been a great deal of oversimplification and hype 
around this selection process and its impact said sheldon 
goldman a university of massachusetts political scientist who 
studies federal courts the impact is there but it is much more 
subtle than folks think or would like us to believe 
civil rights organizations and liberal advocacy groups have 
accused both reagan and bush of pursuing a longrange strategy to 
pack the federal courts with conservative ideologues 
during the reagan administration liberal opposition was a 
factor in the withdrawal of eight nominees to the federal bench and 
the rejection by the senate judiciary committee of three others 
the confirmation battles culminated in the democratcontrolled 
senates rejection 1987 of robert bork an outspoken conservative 
for a seat on the supreme court 
so far bushs judicial nominees have enjoyed smoother sailing 
in the senate 
the bush administration has tried to lower the thermostat in 
terms of the selection process goldman said 
reagan appointed a number of conservative theorists such as law 
professors richard posner frank easterbrook and stephen williams 
bush has generally appointed practicing lawyers with establishment 
republican credentials 
under bush there certainly isnt that effort to find 
professors whose judicial philosophies are carefully carved out 
there isnt that zealousness in trying to fit all their 
candidates through this very narrow prism said melanne verveer 
executive vice president of liberal group people for the american 
way 
bushs nominees bear an unmistakable conservative stamp but 
they are not necessarily of an ideological flavor said ae 
dick howard a university of virginia law professor they are 
people who are by and large of conservative temperament but whose 
background is not markedly political 
so far no bush nominee has been rejected by the judiciary 
committee but controversy looms next year 
the committee took no action for seven months on bushs 
nomination of kenneth ryskamp a miami federal judge accused of 
being hostile to civil rights to a seat on the 11th circuit court 
of appeals 
the nomination died when congress adjourned but ryskamp is 
expected to be renominated next year when lawmakers reconvene 
his membership in a private country club reputed to have once 
excluded blacks and jews and his pronouncements from the district 
bench could trigger the first senate confirmation fight over a 
bush judicial nominee 
people for the american way has noted in mailings to its members 
that ryskamp ruled against the plaintiffs in all but four of 41 
cases involving civil and constitutional rights that came before 
him nine of ryskamps civil rights rulings were reversed by the 
appellate court to which he was nominated 
critics also point to a case in which the judge told some black 
teenagers who had been attacked by police dgs that it might not 
be inappropriate to carry around a few scars to remind you or your 
wrongdoing in the past 
a renewed ryskamp nomination could end two years of relative 
peace between the democratic senate and the republican white house 
on judicial nominees

the blue plastic bubbles atop saudi arabias 
dhahran international hotel symbolize all that has changed in tvs 
coverage of war 
the bubbles house satellite uplink facilities and they now 
transmit reports on us and other troops training for a possible 
war with iraq should that war begin the uplinks would transmit 
tvs taped combat coverage faster and in greater quantities than 
ever before in a largescale conflict 
and that coverage for the first time would be watched on both 
sides of the battlefront cable news networks coverage of us and 
allied troops can be seen on a sameday basis both in baghdad and 
in washington 
how much will be seen is anyones guess even though pentagon 
officials say therell be no censorship at the transmission site in 
dhahran because for all the new and flashy technology at least 
one thing is expected to remain the same in a persian gulf war 
the friction between the military and the media 
if fighting erupts abc anchorman peter jennings thinks us 
military officials will prevent us from seeing it as best they 
can although he admits that he doesnt know what really will 
happen if the shooting starts 
i dont know what the bottom line is but its an extremely 
simple environment in which to control the press 
although details still are being worked out there initially 
would be print and broadcast pool coverage of any hostilities with 
a security review of outgoing material to see if it violates 
ground rules of coverage 
even though the pentagon says therell be no censorship its 
unclear what will happen if the security review causes a dispute 
over a given report and what if anything will happen to the 
reporter if the story is sent 
if you agree to the ground rules you would not expect if you 
violate them to have access to the us military resources says 
robert hall a senior pentagon spokesman 
he refuses to specifically say if a violator would be barred 
from accompanying us troops but we are confident that there is 
not a problem with reporters understanding what the purpose of the 
ground rules is 
we are not going to let people compromise the safety of the 
troops he says thats the bottom line i cant speculate on 
what would happen if people did but we are not going to allow 
that 
print and tv reporters in vietnam while also subject to ground 
rules regarding tactical information such as planned operations 
had a great deal of access tous operations american viewers saw 
an uncensored war 
but fast tv coverage wasnt common satellite transmission was 
in its infancy and and rarely used because of cost field reports 
on film then not videotape usually aired several days after the 
fact 
but satellites got a heavy workout 23 years ago this month as 
us networks showed the bloody scenes of the communist tet 
offensive in vietnam nbc showed the first footage shots of 
fighting at the us embassy in saigon airing it raw and unedited 
on the huntleybrinkley report 
even with satellites nbcs footage was almost a day old it had 
to be flown from saigon to tokyo processed there and then sent 
via satellite to the united states it arrived 10 minutes before 
the show began at 630 pm est 
despite todays swift tv coverage network officials say that if 
war starts after or before the jan 15 deadline the united 
nations has given irag to get out of kuwait its unlikely thered 
be live battlefield coverage 
the uplink gear isnt mobile enough it also can make a nice 
target 
you never say never in this business says ed turner cnns 
executive vice president for newsgathering but it live 
coverage is highly unlikely at this point because the gear while 
portable aint that portable 
you still need to set up an uplink and it takes a couple of 
hours to assemble and if youre out where shells are falling 
 
print and broadcast reporters must sign up in dhahran in the 
same hotel where the tv satellite farm is located at the joint 
information bureau nicknamed the jib the bureaus director 
is us army col william mulvey 
the number of print and broadcast journalists registered there 
fluctuates daily but it has almost grown to vietnam size 450 
when when president bush visited us troops at thankgiving nearly 
360 later in december of that total 110 were from abc cbs cnn 
and nbc 
although theres no censorship reporters must abide by military 
ground rules concerning tactical operations unit locations and 
strength 
and mulvey says he has warned potential pool reporters that he 
wont let anyone go out with the troops whos not in good 
physical condition i dont want the safety of any of our 
troops jeopardized by a journalist who cant keep up 
what concerns network officials far more is how much access 
their crews will have to the troops in the field when and if 
fighting begins and how quickly the military will get the reports 
back for satellite transmission 
military escorts some of them renowned as spin doctors in 
uniform now accompany reporters on organized trips to various 
us units 
the reporters have to sign up for the trips and are taken on a 
firstcome firstserved basis though more than one public affairs 
officer has privately admitted that tv gets precedence 
it is clear that swarms of reporters will not be out there 
wandering unescorted on the battlefield as cnns turner notes in 
the initial stages well go and only be able to show what the 
military will permit the pool to show not unlike world war ii 
what the military does is that they precensor they dont 
take you to areas where they dont want you says ed fouhy 
reporters used to accompany fouhy when he was a marine captain 
in charge of a rifle company patrolling the damascusbeirut highway 
during an earlier middle east crisis the lebanon crisis of 1958 
he later became a network news producer and executive and at 
one point was cbs bureau chief in saigon 
now a freelance tv producer in washington fouhy thinks 
restrictions will be tight in the early stages of a persian gulf 
ar 
and itll itll be difficult for the press corps to get a real 
grip on whats happening because itll be so fast a lot of it 
will be air war and a lot will be at night he says 
he also predicts that us military escorts for the press will 
not be particularly cooperative in the early going theyll be 
uptight but i think things will loosen up assuming that the us 
is successful

a presidential panel on rural development says 
in its final report that future planners should keep in mind that 
there are many perceptions of rural america and its people 
including some that are not very accurate 
the 15member national commission on agriculture and rural 
development policy said that definitions of rural america 
abound and that what appears to be rural in one part of the 
nation may seem pretty citified in another 
but the commission which was authorized in the expiring 1985 
farm law shied away from offering a single definition of rural 
the chairman of the commission is charles pete knigge a 
dairy and grain farmer from omro wis 
other members representing diverse interests and regions 
include other farmers and officials of agricultural organizations 
representatives of agricultural industries and financial 
institutions public office holders and educators 
the massive 1990 farm law includes a rural development package 
along with a provision that creates a new rural development 
administration within the agriculture department 
many of the existing development programs in the farmers home 
administration for example would be transferred to the new 
agency 
the commissions report which was sent to president bush 
earlier this month put the formation of a national rural 
development policy at the top of the agenda 
no giant federal spending programs were recommended federal 
advice expertise and other such help should be available but 
rural people will have to settle their own problems 
the term rural america has come to include farms and forested 
areas mining and manufacturing areas isolated small towns and 
places under the growing influence of nearby urban centers the 
report said 
however it added if policy is to effectively address rural 
needs there must be a clear understanding of the character of 
rural america 
popular beliefs about rural america are based on many 
perceptions the report said some if once true no longer 
are these misperceptions mayobscure true conditions in rural 
areas and divert policies in directions that are inappropriate to 
modern rural needs 
the commission listed five major points to help confront and 
refute misperceptions relating to rural development policy the 
facts based on the report include 
most rural americans no longer depend mainly on farming for 
their jobs and income 
agriculture is one of the nations biggest industries and is the 
source of food and fiber for domestic and export consumption in 
many states and rural areas agriculture is the leading source of 
basic income in the economy 
but less than 10 percent of the rural work force is directly 
employed in farming in most rural areas other industries 
especially manufacturing and services have eclipsed farming as a 
primary source of livelihood 
rural america is more than smalltown farmcentered midwestern 
communities 
the national perception of rural is heavily influenced by 
images of smalltown america popularized in films and television 
where the simple life persists 
the largest numbers of rural americans live in the south where 
they are more likely to work at manufacturing jobs than in farming 
and in the midwest where much of the nations food production 
occurs 
still others call western and new england communities home far 
from being monopolized by farm trade centers rural america is made 
up of a diverse array of fishing villages in coastal areas mining 
towns in appalachia and the west mill towns in the southeast and 
tourist centers near national parks and natural attractions 
each of these communities faces different challenges 
not all of rural america is losing population 
during the mid1980s more rural counties lost population than 
grew over the entire decade more people moved out of rural 
america than moved into it 
but these totals obscure the rapid growth that sometimes occurs 
in many parts of rural america 
in areas that have highquality natural amenities such as 
coastline mountains or a warm climate large numbers of retirees 
and vacationers have made them among the fastest growing areas in 
the nation 
both growing and declining rural areas face difficult problems 
population losses cause strains for communities trying to 
provide basic services sometimes this threatens their survival as 
social and economic units 
growing communities whose expanding populations bring new tax 
dollars and vitality do not suffer from declining services and 
property values but growth especially if its rapid creates 
other problems including new residents with values and 
expectations that differ from those of existing residents 
rapid growth can also put pressure on community services and 
institutions to keep pace with rising demands rising property 
assessments that challenge lowincome residents to meet growing tax 
obligations and the prospect that new job opportunities may go to 
new residents leaving few benefits for longtime citizens 
many rural residents live in poverty 
one in seven rural americans mostly in the south have incomes 
below the official government poverty level of 12675 a year for a 
family of four the rural poor are likely to be working poor 
people with jobs many families have two or more fulltime workers 
whose wages are too low even to yield a povertylevel income 
the report added concentrated in minority groups the poor 
live in areas that have been bypassed by economic growth leaving 
them few alternatives to the meager jobs they hold 
their inability to afford proper health care results in 
disabilities that limit their ability to perform the manual labor 
jobs on which they often depend their poor schools provide them 
with educations inadequate to qualify them for better paying 
jobs

mazda motor corp of japan said wednesday it would 
cut the salaries of its chairman and 17 other top executives by up 
to 10 percent for three months in connection with a recall of 
nearly 3500 cars 
the pay cuts for chairman kenichi yamamoto and the other 
executives were decided one day after the transport ministry warned 
mazda to pay stricter attention to the safety of its cars said a 
mazda official speaking on condition of anonymity 
the cuts which range from 5 percent to 10 percent will last 
for the first quarter of 1991 the official said 
the ministry has investigated charges that mazda has been 
replacing defective parts during routine maintenance without 
recalling the cars or notifying the government 
after the warning madza notified the ministry tuesday that it 
would recall 3498 luce model passenger cars produced between aug 
8 1986 and jan 31 1987 because of switch defects in their stop 
lights and cruise control mechanisms 
because of the defective switches stop lights may not work even 
if the driver hits the brakes and the cruise control may not turn 
off quickly 
of the cars to be recalled 134 were exported to middle eastern 
countries mazda said the others were sold in japan

merger talks between pan am corp and trans 
world airlines inc were on hold today after twa chairman carl 
icahn accused pan am of showing a lack of good faith 
pan am and twa negotiated through the weekend and into monday 
over whether twa would lend pan am enough money to keep it 
operating until the struggling carriers can merge 
twa spokesman don morrison said pan ams representatives 
canceled a monday meeting to discuss the offer and no talks were 
held tuesday 
pan am spokesman jeff kreindler denied tuesday that talks had 
broken off he said the next step is for mr icahn to submit a 
definitive offer to the company 
we also indicated there would have to be bridge financing 
until the deal could close he said 
pan am on friday accepted icahns buyout offer of 150 in cash 
and about 1 in preferred stock or notes for each of pan ams 150 
million outstanding shares as long as twa made the loan the deal 
would value the airline at about 375 million 
icahn launched his offer for pan am as he announced plans to 
sell all of twas london routes and some other assets to a 
healthier rival american airlines in a package worth 625 
million 
icahn has sought assurances that pan am could repay the loan 
estimated at as much as 100 million icahn has proposed forwarding 
pan am debtorinpossession financing that would put twa first 
in line for repaymen t during a pan am bankruptcy reorganization 
in a monday letter to pan am corp chairman thomas plaskett 
icahn wrote the conflicting attitudes and signals that we have 
received from you and your other representatives cause us to wonder 
whether you are serious when you say that you believe that a 
combination of pan am and twa would be advantageous to our 
shareholders employees and other constituencies 
icahn also wrote that he was amazed pan am sold its london 
routes to united airlines on oct 23 
for pan am to sell assets to third parties without discussing 
the same with twa demonstrates your lack of a good faith interest 
in negotiating the merger of some of our airlines icahn wrote 
pan am got some financial help monday as ual corp advanced 20 
million toward leaseholds on gates and other property at san 
francisco international airport pan am said the city airports 
commission has approved the deal and final city authorization is 
expected early next month 
weak airlines such as pan am and twa have been hurt by rising 
fuel costs following iraqs invasion of kuwait in august and fewer 
passengers due to the recession 
pan am has posted huge losses over the past decade and has 
survived by selling assets piecemeal 
pan am has completed the sale of two boeing 747 jumbo jets to 
ual and a 10 million spare parts sale is expected to be completed 
soon said kriendler 
the sale of the leaseholds boeing jets and spare parts were all 
included in a 400 million deal to sell united some of pan ams 
routes to londons heathrow airport 
the route sale has been snagged as us and british authorities 
negotiate over whether united can take over pan ams authority to 
use heathrow or be switched to the less desirable but less 
congested gatwick airport

zubaz pants are zooming off warehouse 
racks in greater quantities as the zany pajamalike clothes add 
pizazz and dollars to the fashion industry 
but it wasnt instant success for former prison guard bob truax 
and his weightlifting buddy dan stock who created the wildly 
patterned drawstring pants on a shoestring budget in 1988 
we were laughed right out of sales meetings we got laughed at 
over the telephone says truax who is now laughing all the way 
to the bank 
truax and stock began selling zubaz pronounced zoobaz pants 
in the pro shop of their roseville weightlifting gym zubaz which 
means in your face in gym lingo was designed by a weightlifter 
and sewn by inmates at womens state prison in shakopee with fabric 
bought from local stores 
today theyre sold in more than 75 patterns of assorted animal 
hides and jungle vegetation through warrior distributing co 
similarly patterned zubaz hats ties shorts tshirts and diaper 
covers also have evolved 
sales of the pants and accessories are expected to at least 
double in 1991 from last year to more than 40 million according 
to the company 
zubaz moved from gym shops into the mainstream with the help 
john ford a jc penney co store manager who was wowed by the 
pants after seeing two university of minnesota football players 
wearing them while shopping he quickly placed a 270000 order for 
penney 
theyve been blowing out of stores ever since stock said 
warrior distributing has 5000 retail accounts nationwide 
besides large orders from stores like penney the company gets a 
bevy of smaller orders from sporting goods stores college book 
stores and small department stores 
were getting faxes of orders every day that are three to 
four inches deep truax said weve got areas of the country 
where its going nuts singer crystal taliefero counts herself 
among the enthusiastic zubaz wearers she custom ordered several 
pairs of pants recently

home equity loans have been developing a fast 
following in these troubled economic times as more homeowners find 
themselves debtridden and cashstrapped 
loans based on home values can give consumers tens of thousands 
of dollars at relatively low interest rates and unlike other 
loans the interest in many cases is tax deductible 
but experts warn that homeowners should exercise a great deal of 
caution before using their single most valuable possession as 
collateral 
the house is the last major remaining asset folks have and 
banks are all too willing to loan against the house because the 
loans are fully collaterized said robert k heady publisher of 
bank rate monitor a weekly newsletter based in north palm beach 
fla 
consumers have to remember if they cant pay the loans back 
they lose the farm 
experts say the appeal of homeequity loans with interest 
rates hovering about between one and three percentage points above 
banks prime rate should grow as rates in general continue to 
decline the prime rate for most major banks stands at 10 percent 
however a few institutions recently lowered their rates to 975 
percent 
rates remain much higher on unsecured bank loans the average 
interest rate charged on a bank credit card was 1883 percent in 
december up from 1860 percent at the start of the year according 
to bank rate monitor the average rate for a bank personal loan was 
1734 percent up from 1719 percent in january the publication 
said 
for home equity loans banks typically lend up to 80 percent of a 
homes appraised market value minus the amount owners owe on their 
mortgage 
more than 50 billion was lent out through homeequity lines of 
credit in 1989 and that figure is expected to grow between 15 and 
20 percent in 1990 according to the american bankers association 
despite its growing popularity experts warn these loans can 
contain many hidden costs that could run into hundreds of dollars 
such as closing costs application fees and appraisal fees 
also if the prime rate rises consumers with variable rates 
tied to the prime can suddenly be hit with a big jump in their 
monthly payments 
particularly risky is a socalled balloon note a loan that 
calls for payments only on the interest for the first several 
years after that the borrower must cough up payments on a big 
principal 
the consumer who doesnt read the details of the contract goes 
for it says heady 
for those homeowners who dont necessarily have the need for 
cash right away but want the flexibility of longterm loan access 
the option of choice is taking out an extended line of credit 
against their homes value 
however a few banks penalize consumers who dont borrow money 
from the credit line charging them an annual nonusage fee 
that can be around 50 according to heady this is presumably to 
compensate banks for the cost of servicing the loan when they dont 
have the interest income 
other banks charge consumers who prepay their loans typically 2 
percent of the amount in their credit line heady said 
however a prepayment penalty would definitely be the 
exception said phillip wilson a senior vice president at san 
diego trust and savings bank who is vice chairman of american 
bankers associations consumer credit executive committee

sales of beer by far the most popular 
alcoholic beverage in the nation are projected to rise 23 percent 
for a record 190 million barrels this year a trade journal 
reported wednesday 
five of the top 10 brands are expected to post advances in 
1990 collectively recording a projected gain of 12 percent to 
1308 million barrels said the wine spirits and beer industries 
tracker impact 
as usual anheuserbusch inc the worlds largest brewer leads 
the domestic market with projected shipments of 84 million 
31gallon barrels this year budweiser and its ab siblings will 
post 437 percent of market share said the publication 
miller brewing is secondbest in market share with an 
anticipated 221 percent coors brewing co 99 percent stroh 
brewery co 80 percent and g heileman brewing co 61 percent 
heineken continues the topselling imported beer none of the 
figures includes sales of nonalcoholi brews 
the final figures for the year could go even higher than 
expected said impact owing to the wholesaler race to stock up 
before the rise in federal excise taxes on beverage alcohol goes 
into effect on jan 1 the excise tax on beer will double to 18 a 
barrel 
a january windfall is expected for wholesalers who are buying 
beer at pretax rise rates and planning to sell it at posttax rise 
markups noted impact adding 
abnormally heavy shipments in december could result in dismal 
industry sales in the first quarter of 1991 as distributors and 
retailers work down prefet inventory

a bankruptcy judge has barred the new york stock 
exchange from seeking a record 50 million fine from drexel burnham 
lambert group inc saying the firms securities law violations had 
been punished adequately 
the ruling by us bankruptcy judge francis conrad means the 
stock exchange cant proceed with disciplinary action against 
drexel related to the investment firms 1989 guilty plea to six 
felony counts related to illegal trading 
the nyse had planned to seek 25 million each from the parent 
company and the securities subsidiary drexel burnham lambert inc 
it was negotiating with drexel when the parent filed for chapter 11 
bankrupcty protection in february 
under federal law the exchange needed court approval to proceed 
with the disciplinary action the nyse said in a statement that it 
is reviewing the decision to determine whether an appeal is 
appropriate 
in the ruling dated dec 14 conrad deflated the exchanges 
argument that a fine was needed to send a message to wall street 
that wrongdoing would be dealt with harshly 
he said the nyses public policy reasons for seeking the 
penalty dont appear to accomplish much more than drexels 
settlement with the us attorneys office and the securities and 
exchange commission 
drexel in september 1989 settled civil and criminal charges by 
agreeing to plead guilty to the felony counts and pay 650 million 
in fines and restitution 
conrad agreed with drexel in ruling that the nyses attempts to 
extract 50 million from the firm would reult in the 
misallocation of scarce resources that could be used to pay 
creditors 
conrad also said the procedure would distract drexel from 
drawing up a reorganization plan and that drexels professional 
attention must remain focused on this critical stage

buy a soft drink help a school budgets tight 
call a cola company 
that is the thinking behind the unusual partnership between the 
nations leading beverage companies and many parents and 
principals 
in moodus conn the entire town is collecting pepsi caps to 
save the dilapidated nathan haleray high school in the first 
three weeks children saved 20000 caps at a nickel apiece the 
caps wont cover 9 million in expenses but the fundraising drive 
has raised hopes the students have even suggested renaming the 
school pepsicola high school 
its also good business for pepsico inc pepsicolas parent 
company local stores have increased their orders one pharmacy 
ordered 6000 bottles said teacher adam friedman 
weve noticed most of the bottles turned in to recycling 
centers are pepsi products he said people are committing to 
pepsi because of school caps 
at weymouth high school in massachusetts pepsi and coca cola 
are fighting over the chance to erect a new 5000 scoreboard 
pepsi has warned it wont donate the board if the coke vending 
machine remains in the school gym coke has made a counter offer to 
provide a similar board 
school officials once hesitant to mingle educational purposes 
with commercial ventures say tight fiscal times have made these 
partnerships more appealing 
i generally oppose endorsing products said school committee 
member francis corbett but if were gonna make a pact with the 
devil lets get the best deal we can 
the national association of secondary school principals supports 
schoolcorporate partnerships if children arent corrupted in the 
process 
they should not cross the line where they are using students 
for their own profit motives said spokesman lew armistead he 
said the association had objected to channel one a project of 
knoxville tennbased whittle communications which provides 
schools with special television news programming mixed in with 
advertising 
the beverage makers already renowned for innovative ways to 
reach consumers have become more creative about reaching young 
buyers 
pepsis be excellent video a montage of pop stars and 
athletes preaching antidrug and alcohol themes has been shown to 
3 million students in 2700 high schools this year said spokesman 
andrew giangola 
students at pinkston high in dallas and southwestern high school 
in detroit are eligible for 2000 in scholarships if they meet 
attendance grade and drugfree goals 
coca cola donated 50000 to the massachusetts interscholastic 
athletic association to keep the states high school basketball 
tournament afloat 
the cola companies maintaining they have always been dedicated 
to community service say interest in the programs has jumped 
dramatically in the last year 
in economically depressed new england coke has received double 
the requests it got from schools last year dowd said 
schools are extremely cashstrapped and looking to corporate 
america to help out wherever possible said giangola this is a 
great example of how businesses can help schools and schools can 
help businesses 
pepsi usually requires schools to install its vending machines 
in return for scoreboards computer equipment or outright cash 
bonuses 
coca cola according to one vice president does not make such 
deals 
we dont hold anything over their head said donald dowd 
noting coke sponsors high school athletic events rewards athletes 
of the week and donates money to local boys and girls clubs 
but he added weve been very fortunate because of our 
activities to get the endorsement of these schools thats 
business 
for pepsi were selling the product by virtue of the fact we 
have a vending machine on site said ken kimmel new england 
marketing director 
both companies say they are investing in americas future 
promoting education theyre also securing loyalty among a new 
generation of buyers 
said pepsis giangola inschool business is 1 percent of our 
business and 100 percent of our future

soybean futures prices continued a recovery from 
recent lows wednesday on the chicago board of trade leading grain 
futures to higher levels as well 
the rally extended a rebound in soybean and soybean meal futures 
that began monday after nearterm delivery prices for those 
commodities dipped to lifeofcontract lows 
by any standards we were a little oversold said michael 
gazall a research analyst with the commodities brokerage refco inc 
in chicago 
he said the markets drew strength from news that the soviet 
parliament had granted president mikhail gorbachev broader powers 
the reports helped to ease fears of a gorbachev ouster that might 
threaten future sales of us grain to moscow 
an announcement that soviet and us trade officials will meet 
jan 4 in washington also supported the grain markets gazall said 
at the close wheat futures were cent to 2 cents higher with 
the contract for delivery in march at 266 a bushel corn was 1 
cent to 2 cents higher with march at 235 a bushel oats were 2 
cents to 2 cents higher with march at 114 a bushel soybeans 
were 1 cents to 5 cents higher with january at 566 a bushel

nearly all american offices have copiers and 
vast majorities have facsimile machines and personal computers a 
survey released wednesday by a leading office equipment company 
found 
the gallup survey commissioned by the ricoh corp also found 
that midlevel managers are increasingly heavy users of these

twentynine percent of office managers use fax machines very 
often vs 15 percent for other office workers and 48 percent of 
managers are heavy users of copiers vs 40 percent of other 
employees the results showed 
when first introduced office automation products were 
intended largely to improve productivity among secretarial and 
clerical employees said mark a stanton manager of production 
communications for ricoh however we now see office equipment 
climbing the corporate ladder so to speak 
the study also showed larger offices are more likely to have 
office equipment for example 90 percent of large offices have fax 
machines vs 83 percent of medium and 60 percent of small offices 
ninetyfour percent of large offices are equipped with personal 
computers vs 89 percent for medium and 78 percent for small

crude oil futures posted the biggest gains in 
three weeks wednesday rising above 27 a barrel on increasing 
fears of a middle east war 
contracts for home heating oil unleaded gasoline and natural 
gas also rose sharply in subdued new york mercantile exchange 
trading after a fourday christmas weekend 
light sweet crude oil for february delivery increased 130 to 
2722 per 42gallon barrel it was the biggest singleday gain 
since a 151 per barrel jump dec 4 
oil market strategists said increasing tension between the 
united states and iraq since the market closed last friday after 
three straight daily declines gave prices a boost 
i think the market is starting to reinternalize the fact that 
war seems very very likely at this point said peter beutel an 
oil analyst with pegasus econometric group inc in hoboken nj 
on wednesday iraqi president saddam hussein said the american 
army would be defeated in any war because it doesnt have right 
on its side 
in an interview broadcast by mexican television saddam also 
said he would not allow the united states to set a date for a 
meeting to discuss the war the united nations has set a jan 15 
deadline for the withdrawal of iraqi forces from kuwait 
in the arabian sea us and other sailors enforcing a un 
trade embargo fired warning shots in a fracas with crew members and 
activists aboard an iraqi ship traders said other us and british 
reports increased the prospects of war 
all those things underscore what people are fearing theyre 
not moving any closer to any resolution by jan 15 said randall 
rothenberg a broker with dean witter reynolds inc 
the market discounted the importance of an israeli newspaper 
report later denied by the state department that a date had 
been set for talks 
the oil market opened sharply higher mimicking gains in trading 
in london on monday after saddam threatened to attack israel first 
if iraq were targeted 
volume on wednesday was light though with less than half the 
typical number of crude oil contracts changing hands traders said 
contracts for latermonth delivery rose 
traders last week sold contracts to hedge against sudden changes 
in the gulf situation over the long weekend in addition a belief 
that diplomatic efforts to solve the crisis might bear fruit had 
depressed crude oil prices in recent weeks 
if war breaks out in the persian gulf oil prices are expected 
to rise sharply because of anticipated limited supplies from the 
region 
technical factors and cold weather around the country pushed up 
home heating oil futures prices heating oil rose 232 cents to 
8126 cents a gallon on contracts for delivery in january after 
rising 006 cent on friday heating oil for delivery in later 
months was higher 
unleaded gasoline rose for all delivery months with january 
contracts up 190 cents to 6814 cents a gallon later months also 
rose 
natural gas prices rose for a third straight trading session 
natural gas for february delivery was up 37 cents at 1999 per 
1000 cubic feet later months were mostly lower

orange juice futures prices spurted higher wednesday on the new 
york cotton exchange reflecting worries that heavy frost damage to 
the california orange crop will hurt juice supplies 
on other markets precious metal futures surged along with crude 
oil livestock and meat futures were mostly higher and grains and 
soybeans advanced 
frozen concentrated orange juice futures settled 17 cents to 
39 cents higher with the contract for delivery in january at 
1181 a pound 
the rally marked the fifth straight trading day of gains for 
most orange juice futures the january contracts price soared 
about 12 percent last week in anticipation of frost damage to 
oranges over the christmas weekend 
extremely cold temperatures on friday saturday and sunday 
nights damaged most of the california navel orange crop the 
nations main source of fresh oranges 
floridas orange crop which is used mainly for juice escaped 
the freeze but the disaster in california means a larger share of 
the florida crop probably will end up in supermarket produce 
sections analysts said 
i believe we will need to bring in oranges from florida for 
the fresh market said celeste georkakis an orange juice analyst 
with cargill investor services inc 
conversely some of the damaged california oranges will be 
processed into frozen juice concentrate she said but that must be 
done quickly to avoid spoilage 
the whole question is how much they can process in a short 
period of time because theyre not geared to processing as much as 
florida where 90 percent of the crop ends up as juice georkakis 
said 
unusually cold weather is expected to return to southern 
california this weekend according to the national weather service 
analysts said few traders were willing to sell oj futures ahead of 
another long holiday weekend with the threat of further crop damage 
in the air 
oil and precious metals futures rose sharply amid increasing 
fears of a middle east war 
the rising tensions partly reflected us and iraqi officials 
inability to agree on a meeting date before the jan 15 deadline 
set by the united nations for withdrawal of iraqi troops from 
kuwait 
on the new york mercantile exchange light sweet crude oil 
futures settled 60 cents to 130 higher with february at 2722 a 
barrel heating oil was 16 cents to 232 cents higher with january 
at 8126 cents a gallon unleaded gasoline was 155 cents to 19 
cents higher with january at 6814 cents a gallon natural gas was 
05 cent lower to 37 cents higher with february at 1999 per 
1000 cubic feet 
gold futures settled 310 to 350 higher on new yorks 
commodity exchange with december at 38560 a troy ounce silver 
was 7 cents to 75 cents higher with december at 4095 a troy 
ounce 
cattle futures rallied strongly on the chicago mercantile 
exchange pulling pork futures mostly higher on fears that the 
fiercely cold weather in the great plains could slow the rate of 
cattle weight gain

standard amp poors corp and the chicago board 
options exchange said wednesday they had settled a lawsuit in which 
sampp charged the exchange with violating a 1983 licensing agreement 
the two sides said they had signed anagreement extending the 
cboes exclusive license to trade options on the sampp 500 index and 
the sampp 100 index two important measures of stock market activity 
sampp a subsidiary of mcgrawhill inc in early november charged 
the chicago exchange with wrongly asserting an exclusive right to 
use the indexes on financial products other than options contracts 
traded on the exchange the cboe denied any breach 
a person familiar with the outofcourt settlement said it 
reaffirms sampps ability to license debt instruments and other 
products using the sampp 100 and 500 indexes other than options 
contracts 
there was no monetary settlement said the official who asked 
not to be identified by name the lawsuit had been filed in 
manhattan federal court 
the new agreement also extends until 1998 the cboes exclusive 
right to trade options contracts based on the two indexes 
a cboe spokesman said the exchange would not comment on the 
terms or conditions of the agreement mcgrawhill spokeswoman 
elizabeth russo said the agreement was mutually satisfactory 
the sampp 100 index and sampp 500 index measure stock performance 
and are traded in units on the nations major options exchanges 
options give an investor the right to buy or sell a security at a 
specified time for a specific price 
sampp had said its license limits the cboe to options contracts on 
the two indexes that are traded on a securities exchange and 
settled through an established clearing house by payment of cash or 
the underlying security 
sampp said the cboes rights do not apply to other financial 
instruments that offer a return based in whole or part on the two 
indexes those include notes certificates of deposit and other 
debt instruments products that trade over the counter and 
financial instruments issued by institutions other than an 
exchange 
the dispute began when sampp withdrew a note offering for denmark 
earlier this year that paid interest based on the sampp 500 
underwriters for the issue were said to have withdrawn from the 
deal because of challenges by cboe officials to use of the index 
sampp a financial information and credit rating agency for 
several years has licensed the rights to use its indexes in 
connection with financial products sold off of exchanges

pennzoil co said wednesday it had upped a stake 
in chevron corp after the internal revenue service granted a 
fivemonth extension for pennzoil to invest proceeds from its 1988 
court settlement with texaco inc 
pennzoil spent 21 billion of a net 26 billion settlement in 
1989 to purchase 315 million common shares of chevron giving it 9 
percent ownership in the company 
in a filing with the securities and exchange commission in 
washington pennzoil said that as of wednesday it owned 328 
million shares approximately 94 percent of the 3508 million 
shares outstanding 
pennzoil said 127 million of those 328 million shares were 
purchased during the past 60 days on the new york stock exchangen 
at an average price of 6975 per share 
in july pennzoil notified the federal trade commission of its 
intent to increase its ownership level to slightly under 10 percent 
by purchasing additional chevron shares 
pennzoil said it needed the extension from the irs because of 
delays in obtaining clearance from the ftc which monitors business 
activity that is considered potentially anticompetitive 
under the irs delay pennzoil said the company now has until 
may 31 1991 to invest proceeds from its historic 1988 texaco 
litigation settlement 
pennzoil sued texaco in 1985 claiming texaco violated a 
contract when it purchased getty oil co at the same time pennzoil 
was attempting to acquire part of getty 
a jury awarded pennzoil more than 10 billion the largest award 
in litigation history but texaco sought bankruptcy court 
protection afterward and the two oil companies settled on 3 
billion before expenses as part of texacos reemergence from the 
bankruptcy process the net settlement to pennzoil was about 26 
billion 
under irs rules pennzoil can defer taxes on the texaco 
settlement if it is reinvested in similar or related property
