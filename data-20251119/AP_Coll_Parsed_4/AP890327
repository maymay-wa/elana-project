the united states and iraq have reached 
agreement in principle for iraq to pay compensation for the 37 us 
sailors killed aboard the frigate stark in a may 1987 iraqi 
missile attack in the persian gulf sources said monday 
the compensation package still needs the formal approval of both 
governments said the sources speaking on condition of anonymity 
progress on the stalled claim request was made when a us 
delegation led by state department legal adviser abraham sofaer 
went to baghdad last week the talks ended monday and sofaer was 
headed back to washington state department spokeswoman margaret 
tutwiler said 
in their talks the us and iraqi teams apparently are 
reaching the final stages of achieving a substantial settlement on 
the claims ms tutwiler said 
she said she did not know when the actual agreement would be 
concluded and could not divulge details of its content 
at the pentagon defense sources said an agreement had been 
reached but they described the accord as tentative subject to 
review back here in washington 
the united states presented iraq with a 296 million claim for 
the families of 37 crewmembers who died on the guided missile 
frigate stark when an iraqi jet fighter fired two frenchmade 
exocet missiles at the ship 
iraq claimed the missile attack was a mistake born of the 
tensions of the iraniraq war 
the us claim was presented 11 months ago but iraq rejected the 
amount which includes 800000 for each of the families 
the defense sources who insisted on anonymity said they could 
not discuss the dollar amount in the agreement or how it might be 
divided among the families of those who were killed the sailors 
who were injured and as settlement toward the cost of repairing 
the stark 
but apparently our negotiators are recommending we settle for 
a bit less than we were originally asking with the goal of ending 
further delays in settling the issue one source said 
in addition to the 296 million sought for the families of the 
37 dead sailors the navy has asked iraq to pay 829 million to 
cover the cost of repairing the stark and returning it to active 
duty with the fleet 
pentagon officials have refused to say how much they asked iraq 
to pay to sailors who suffered injuries but survived the attack

air corps board of directors within the next few days airline 
industry and baseball sources said on condition of anonymity 
eastern spokesman robin matell contacted for comment at his 
miami home said ive heard about it but we just dont comment 
on rumors 
texas air spokesman art kent in houston said his company would 
have no comment on the matter 
there are a lot of those rumors going around kent said 
if and when any agreement is reached to sell eastern im sure all 
the parties involved will issue a statement 
ueberroth spokesman rich levin contacted in new york city said 
the commissioner did not wish to comment on the matter 
a source said the deal would involve kirk kerkorian a los 
angeles businessman who is a friend of ueberroths and is majority 
owner of mgmua communications co ueberroth who headed the host 
committee for the 1984 los angeles olympics is to step down as 
baseball commissioner on saturday 
a call to kerkorians office seeking comment monday night was 
not answered 
texas airs board is holding a regularly scheduled meeting 
tuesday and wednesday said a source close to the company 
ueberroth was approached last fall by officials of easterns 
unions to consider taking over the troubled airline which filed 
for bankruptcy protection march 9 five days after the start of the 
machinists strike supported by airline pilots 
the machinists and pilots unions have said they would make 
concessions if ueberroth took over possibly in return for 
ownership of part of the airline

kerkorian have discussed a possible buyout with texas air chairman 
frank lorenzo 
in miami us district judge edward b davis set a hearing 
thursday on a key issue tossed back to him by an appeals court

merely honoring machinists union picket lines legally or if they 
are trying to advance their own cause with their walkout which 
could violate the national railway labor act 
the air line pilots association has backed the full hearing 
denying their strike is illegal

considered our parallel interests to strengthen our position to 
obtain our own collective bargaining interests said pilots 
attorney james linsey there is nothing wrong with that

inaugurating its first sixweek training class to replace pilots 
who walked out with machinists on march 4 while the carrier had 
planned to begin training up to 50 replacement pilots monday the 
class size ended up smaller than that 
we cut back to 35 said company spokesman robin matell 
adding that all the new hires had impressive qualifications the 
carrier said many are pilots from other carriers hoping to bump up 
their seniority by jumping to eastern 
meanwhile us bankruptcy trustee harold jones who is 
administering easterns chapter 11 bankruptcy reorginization in new 
york said monday he is considering about a dozen candidates for 
examiner in the complex case 
jones who declined to name names said the ideal examiner would 
be someone who can play the role of statesman

later as arriving celebrities ritualistically alight from their 
black limos 
on the party scene the academys official governors ball is

obligatory appearances before heading to private parties

the national rifle association traditional 
heart soul and bankroll of the nations gun lobby is digging in 
for a test of its vaunted political power amid rising pressure to 
curb sales of assault weapons 
when less than half the convicted felons ever spend a day in 
jail why should we be taking firearms away from lawabiding 
people declares james jay baker federal affairs director for 
the 118year old nra 
demands for restrictions on militarystyle semiautomatic 
firearms are escalating however in the aftermath of the stockton 
calif schoolyard tragedy jan 17 in which a deranged gunman with 
an assault rifle left five youngsters dead and 30 other persons 
injured 
so intense is the clamor that as often as the nra has crushed 
or blunted gun control bills in the past many doubt that it can 
prevail this time with its strategy of blaming the murder wave 
sweeping cocaineridden communities not on firearms but our 
crumbling criminal justice system 
were certainly going to try says lobbyist baker 
even rep barney frank dmass who urged democrats to 
softpedal the gun issue after the 1988 election says public 
opinion is ripe for action on semiautomatics i think the nra is 
stubbing its toe here he says the appearance of being 
unwilling to deal with assault rifles has hurt them 
from its modern headquarters on rhode island avenue in downtown 
washington a few blocks from the white house the nra deploys 
lobbyists to capitol hill and statehouses across the nation 
provides generous campaign contributions to its political friends 
and generates tons of literature to fill the mailboxes of americas 
gun enthusiasts 
with annual revenues of 70 million and a staff of 365 
employees including 65 in its lobbying department the nra is well 
equipped to fight its political battles it also has powerful 
friends president bush is a member and its roots go deep in the 
fabric of american life 
founded in 1871 by national guard officers the nra has long 
counted many military men and policemen among its members it holds 
firearms courses for police private security firms and private 
citizens 
it is recognized by the us olympic committee as the national 
governing body of shooting sports in the united states and 
maintains a junior program for youngsters it also provides 
selfdefense courses for women and maintains a 1100piece gun 
museum within its headquarters as well as a special 
muzzleloaders division within its membership for history buffs 
last year the nra got the house to shelve a proposed sevenday 
waiting period for wouldbe gun buyers failure of the bill named 
for former presidential spokesman james brady brain damaged in the 
1981 attempt on president reagan spurred bradys wife to urge 
readers in fullpage magazine ads to help break the nras death 
grip on congress 
the real secret of the nras power has long been its ability to 
mobilize hundreds of thousands of gun owners across the nation to 
write and telephone lawmakers please open immediately 
legislative alert trumpets a mailing that went to virginia gun 
owners in february 
it warns of an impending bill in richmond in which the 
antigunners have launched an allout attack on semiautomatic 
firearms in line with their goal of banning all firearms 
your immediate action is needed to defeat this dangerous 
bill it says but the general assembly nevertheless approved the 
measure calling for a background check of wouldbe gun buyers 
california lawmakers are expected to pass a more stringent measure 
and bills are pending in connecticut florida illinois maryland 
minnesota new jersey new york rhode island and texas 
a number of cities including los angeles and cleveland also 
have approved restrictions on semiautomatic weapons and on sunday 
the international association of chiefs of police announced its 
opposition to the public sale and distribution of the guns 
the chain reaction has led to a further question of nra power 
the nra is being forced increasingly to the fringes of this 
debate says dr garen wintemute of sacramento calif who 
treated ak47 assault rifle wounds as a doctor in a cambodian 
jungle hospital in 1981 on coming home he was shocked to find the 
same ak47 wounds in the united states 
more and more people are willing to come out and say the 
emperor has no clothes meaning the nra says the doctor who has 
become an outspoken critic of assaultrifle sales 
others are more skeptical about the alleged erosion of nra power 
the nra members havent lost anything with me declares rep 
harold volkmer dmo few if any house members take a dimmer view 
of gun control 
pending bills aimed at militarystyle assault weapons also would 
take away my browning shotgun and my thirtyoughtsix deer 
rifle says volkmer i think we can kill that up here i think 
we can beat it 
what happens in the house will depend heavily on the view from 
the hustings democrats say a blizzard of nra mailings against 1988 
presidential nominee michael dukakis were probably not decisive 
but they hurt especially in states where gun owners are plentiful 
texas political consultant george christian says the dukakis 
stand in favor of toughened gun control wasnt the no1 issue 
in his state but as part of a package of issues that subjected 
him to attack from the other side it played a very important 
role 
the republicans used gun control advertising very heavily so 
obviously their polling showed that it was an important issue he 
says 
but on capitol hill a stream of guncontrol bills is flowing 
into the hopper sponsored by rep fortney pete stark dcalif 
and an array of other californians 
the most heavily spotlighted bill however is being offered by 
sen howard m metzenbaum dohio it would place certain 
semiautomatics such as the ak47 and the israelimade uzi in the 
same restrictedsales category with fully automatic machine guns 
it also would allow the treasury department to put additional 
semiautomatics in the same class private citizens may own machine 
guns but only if they are fingerprinted pay a 200 fee undergo an 
fbi background check and get permission from their local law 
enforcement officials 
this has not deterred all firearms fans grant stapleton a 
pennsylvania nra member declares that he would hate to part with 
the 50caliber machine gun that is the centerpiece of his 
collection why does he want it 
what does anyone pay 150000 for a ferrari why does anyone 
want a matisse stapleton muses his company makes a 
sinisterlooking rounddrummed semiautomatic shotgun called the 
striker which pumps out 12 rounds of 12gauge shot in three 
seconds the weapon designed by a rhodesian farmer to chase off 
rebels is precisely what metzenbaum wants to outlaw

whether theyre from cambodia el salvador 
vietnam ethiopia or iraq they all seem to speak the same 
language the language of the refugee 
the voice and the picture of the worlds 14 million political 
refugees of whom it has been calculated that only three of every 
100 ever return to their homeland is brought home in a newly 
published photo book 
the book forced out represents an unusual collaboration by 
four publishing houses and a foundation in an attempt to inspire a 
global movement on behalf of the human rights of refugees often 
unwanted guests in unwelcoming camps it consists largely of 
accounts by refugees of the sometimes bewildering frightening or 
hopeless twists their lives took once they were forced from their 
homelands 
to a world inured to political disaster the voices sound 
familiar 
a salvadoran describing how the national guard conscripts boys 
from a sleeping village no one could run that night maybe 
because the boys were still half asleep they are only going for a 
year the members of the patrol would say to make us feel better 
and theyll be more civilized when we send them back in the 
barracks they learn to read and mind their manners they went on 
without looking at anyone addressing the stones that were us the 
year was up but they never came back no one comes back 
an ethiopian resettled in somalia arriving in the area of 
settlement we were scared to death you feel lost never had we 
seen such thick forest inhabited only by wild animals snakes and 
big biting flies homeland was a beautiful place full of grazing 
cattle my dreams are still bound to my homeland 
an afghan looking for a new home we were deported from the 
united states to korea on march 29 they next day korean airlines 
took us to taiwan and then to hong kong hong kong refused us and 
sent us back to korea the koreans then sent us to sri lanka and 
told the sri lankan authorities that we should be sent on to 
afghanistan the sri lankan government refused to accept us so 
korean airlines took us to saudi arabia 
a salvadoran if we speak out they kill us if were 
suspected of speaking out they disappear us and if we keep our 
mouths shut they think were hiding something so they kill us for 
that too 
in one painful paragraph a famous american doctor howard a 
rusk describes how the body starves 
nature becomes kinder to the starving at this juncture kinder 
than the politicians arguing about boundaries and power a great 
overpowering lethargy develops and a kind and wise nature offers 
large doses of sleep to ease the pain of slow death in the 
meantime the body proteins have been depleted the water and 
electrolyte balance destroyed the abdomen becomes distended with 
fluids the extremities swollen with water and now the 
degeneration of the vital organs such as the liver and the kidneys 
starts in earnest 
a vietnamese boat person describes the desperation of the 
starving our food and water ran out no ship rescued us please 
wait until tomorrow ill die then youll eat me said dao huo 
cuong three of us pulled cuong out of the cabin and held his head 
in water then one of us butchered him four others helped we 
cooked the meat in boiling water i remember we prayed to the lord 
before we killed mr cuong 
principal author carole kismaric says political rather than 
natural disasters create most refugees and most are forced from 
their homes by their own governments either for supporting rival 
factions or so that their land can be seized 
bill frelick of the us committee for refugees in an essay on 
how countries accept or reject refugees writes refugees are 
inconvenient their concern is not for order systems or 
bureaucracies nor for the general welfare their concern rather 
is for survival their own and that of their families 
governments on the other hand have competing concerns the 
sovereignty of borders relations with neighboring countries 
controlling immigration promoting ruling ideologies placating 
public opinion if offering asylum to a refugee is consonant with 
those concerns a government might come to his aid 
forced out a collection of photographs and firstperson 
accounts refugees was commissioned by the j m kaplan fund 
supporter of human rights watch which monitors the conditions of 
refugees it was published in a collaboration by random house ww

a tiny pale aqua egg was found in the nest 
box of a pair of nearly extinct california condors at the los 
angeles zoo 
the egg measuring 5 inches long 3 inches in circumference and 
weighing about 10 ounces was spotted early easter sunday morning 
zoo workers took the egg to an incubator while the parents 
cuyama and cachuma a pair of 6yearolds were away from the nest 
what an easter egg said zoo spokeswoman deborah pollack 
if fertile god willing it will hatch in 54 to 58 days 
the pair had an egg last month that proved to be infertile zoo 
officials also took that egg away for artificial incubation in 
hopes that cachuma would double clutch or lay a second egg 
we have high hopes for this egg because since the time of the 
last one they have definitely improved their mating technique 
ms pollack said its a big egg a nice egg it looks good but 
we wont know for sure for another week 
she added that there were no cracks in the shell 
in the wild the massive birds with a 9foot wing span would 
normally lay one egg every other year ms pollack said 
molloko is the only california condor chick conceived in 
captivity the bird was born last april and stays in the san diego 
wild animal park 
there are only 28 california condors left in the world fourteen 
of them are in the wild animal park and 14 at the los angeles zoo

for years the united states has urged 
threatened and cajoled the kremlin to allow free emigration from 
the soviet union but now that thousands of soviets are being let 
out many are finding the doors to the united states closed 
some 19000 soviets are waiting to be interviewed at the us 
embassy in moscow for permission to enter the united states as 
refugees another 7000 are waiting in temporary quarters near 
rome according to state department figures 
the steadily growing backlog appears to result from several 
factors poor planning by the administration severe budget 
restraints and a change in the justice departments refugee policy 
now that the soviet union has chosen to let these people go 
we must not fail them said rep howard berman dcalif who has 
sponsored one of several proposed funding bills to ease the 
emergency 
sen robert kasten rwis cosponsor of another emergency 
funding proposal warned that gorbachevs policies could change 
overnight we have to take advantage of this moment 
soviet applicants have been told their processing could take as 
long as two years and have been advised not to quit jobs or tell 
landlords they plan to leave for fear of finding themselves without 
work or housing 
last fall the united states asked soviet authorities to withhold 
exit permits until some of the backlog can be cleared jewish 
community officials say 
at the current rate of soviet applications about 4000 a month 
the united states will run out of allocated refugee slots by 
april or may in january the state department shifted 7000 unused 
slots meant for vietnamese refugees to accommodate the soviet 
overflow revised estimates project some 40000 soviet applicants 
this year about 20000 more than was budgeted for by the 
administration 
the crisis has been compounded by a change in justice department 
policy which no longer grants automatic refugee status to every 
person seeking to leave the soviet union 
in the past all soviet jews who account for the majority of 
soviet emigres were presumed to have a well founded fear of 
persecution and therefore were considered refugees 
jews were subjected to governmentbacked antisemitism 
prevented from studying hebrew or practicing their religion and 
denied permission to leave in 1984 the low point of jewish 
emigration only 896 jews were let out 
a directive issued last summer by former attorney general edwin 
meese ordered the immigration and naturalization service to 
determine refugee status for soviets on a casebycase basis rather 
than as a group in keeping with the way us laws are applied for 
other refugee applicants 
this has resulted in denials for as many as 70 percent of moscow 
applicants for refugee status according to a justreleased report 
by the general accounting office the investigative arm of congress 
the report found a 50 percent reversal rate on appeal by those 
denied evidence of uneven standards and inconsistencies among 
ins officers 
the report faulted ins inspectors for in many cases not 
speaking russian and not knowing about life in the soviet union in 
some cases ins processors were brought to moscow from duty along 
the usmexican border and applied the same standards to soviet 
applicants as to mexicans the report said 
those denied refugee status are being offered parolee status 
which does not provide government funding nor does it allow the 
recipients to eventually apply for citizenship 
this sends a message to the soviet government that the united 
states no longer views jews and other minorities as persecuted 
people said david harris washington representative of the 
american jewish committee which lobbies for soviet jewish 
immigration its a strange political statement as a time when 
the administration has decided to keep up its pressure on gorbachev 
to comply with international human rights standards he said 
the administration caught in a squeeze is scrambling to 
respond 
the white house is preparing an emergency request to congress 
for 100 million to help process and resettle the flood of 
emigrants 
the justice department has prepared legislation that would allow 
as many as 30000 people to enter the united states annually if the 
president declares it in the best foreign policy interests of the 
united states unlike refugees though these people would not be 
given government funding 
the state department is conducting an internal review of the 
problem in preparation for consultations with congress on 
increasing the number of refugees allowed into the country 
meanwhile more ins officers are being sent to moscow to help 
hasten the processing said john moore director of the bureau for 
refugee programs at the state department 
moore told a congressional hearing that the state department 
could not have foreseen the surge of soviet applicants when it 
budgeted last year for this fiscal year but members of congress 
and jewish community groups are accusing the administration of 
deliberately misleading them 
the administrations refugee program is phony said rep 
david obey dwis head of the house subcommittee on foreign 
operations this was not unpredictable in light of last years 
growing emigration trends he told moore 
obey accused the administration of presenting deliberately low 
predictions in order to stay within the limits of the budget 
knowing it could obtain emergency funding later on to respond to 
the humanitarian crisis 
jewish groups contend the low figures are part of an 
administration attempt to shift the funding for refugee programs 
increasingly to private groups 
currently the american jewish community provides about 2 to 3 
for every government dollar spent on refugee admissions and 
resettlement and it has launched a 75 million fundraising 
campaign to provide for the flood of emigres

a feud is smoldering between two world 
institutions based in washington with billions of dollars to lend 
and the power to make deeply indebted countries tighten their belts 
the disagreement between the world bank and the international 
monetary fund centers around the division of work between them 
which should be telling governments to devalue their currencies 
which should require cuts in government spending which should look 
at longterm problems how long is longterm 
the 151 governments that own the bank and the imf which get 
together every spring and fall start meetings in the coming week 
their ministers of finance and central bankers will have a lot to 
say about the debt of third world countries now over 12 
trillion what the two organizations can do about it depends on 
clearing up just what their roles should be or even whether they 
should be merged 
treasury secretary nicholas brady has put out some new ideas on 
how to reduce the debt but critics are saying they may be too 
little and too late other governments are expected to suggest 
doing more 
before the meetings open president barber conable of the bank 
a former congressman from new york and managing director michel 
camdessus of the fund a frenchman are trying to agree on how to 
cooperate the united states and nine other leading governments 
have asked lamberto dini the no 2 at the italian governments 
central bank to report on improving the relations between the twin 
institutions 
if they dont get their act together theres going to be more 
pressure to merge them said c fred bergsten who heads the 
private institute for international economics 
that would be a mistake because they would only have to be 
separated again after a few years 
bergsten used to be in charge of us relations with them as 
assistant secretary of the treasury for international affairs 
both organizations are linked to the united nations but they 
have something it lacks teeth by giving or holding back loans and 
by the conditions they set they can sometimes make or break 
governments 
their conditions can lead to violence most recently a 
reduction in government subsidies urged by the fund brought an 
increase in bus fares that touched off riots last month in 
venezuela at least 300 people were killed 
both the world bank and the imf were set up at a meeting in 
bretton woods nh as world war ii came to an end western 
leaders were hoping to nip in the bud the economic problems that 
had twice helped to plunge the world into bloody conflict 
the bank officially the international bank for reconstruction 
and development was to help the countries devastated by the war to 
recover a decent standard of living as they did the bank turned 
to the third world making easy longterm loans for schools 
hospitals farms roads ports the basic needs of poor countries 
india and brazil were among the biggest borrowers 
the funds job was to keep currencies stable big shifts in 
currency values upset world trade and bad trade relations can lead 
to bad political relations as recently as the 1970s it was helping 
britain and italy with such problems 
in time the fund too found itself working mostly in the third 
world where high values for local currencies wre making trade 
difficult often the exchange rates were only part of a countrys 
problem the fund offered big loans and mobilized more from private 
banks to get the loans borrowing governments had to promise 
changes in their policies austerity programs often including 
devaluations to put the debtors in better shape to keep up with 
their debts 
billions went to brazil mexico and other major debtors 
in 1985 james a baker iii then secretary of the treasury said 
the way out of the debt problem was more loans and more policy 
changes by the borrowers the baker plan called on the bank to map 
out longerterm programs for them since their problems went too 
deep to be solved in a few years and the bank was used to taking 
the long view it had always made some policybased loans now 
it started making more 
so bank and fund with headquarters facing one another in 
downtown washington found their jobs overlapping more and more 
they approached problems from different viewpoints 
lord keynes the british economist who helped set them up was 
quoted as saying that the bank is a fund and the fund is a bank 
funds are usually concerned with improving peoples living 
standards banks worry more about finance but some of the imfs 
staff of 1600 have seen the world bank as a collection of 6000 
softminded dogooders many in the bank thought the fund too 
preoccupied with the worlds financial system and insensitive to 
peoples needs 
neither bank nor fund officials want to be quoted about their 
differences except to say that they try hard to work together but 
some acknowledge privately that they have occasionally given 
countries contradictory advice 
last october the bank offered 700 million worth of loans to 
argentina the fund had been negotiating with argentina for years 
but could not get the government of president raul alfonsin to meet 
its conditions the banks offer raised a lot of eyebrows in the 
past the bank had waited for the funds approval of a countrys 
policies before going ahead with its own lending 
in february after disbursing 150 million the bank decided 
argentina was not meeting its own conditions and refused to 
disburse another 350 million 
there were some quiet itoldyousos from sympathizers with 
the fund but officials said the banks action showed that the two 
institutions were closer to seeing eyetoeye

an improving economy and a surge of federal 
relief measures have put easy credit back within reach of farmers 
but an agriculture department economist says yielding to temptation 
could be hazardous to the financial health of some of them 
farmers have reasons to be optimistic says gregory gajewski 
of the departments economic research service the burdensome 
grain stocks are dropping and commodity prices are strong in the 
face of rising domestic and foreign demand 
gajewski cites rising land values after years of declines and 
bankers willingness to lend as reflections of farmers improved 
outlook 
but the current optimism is tempered by the knowledge that the 
us and foreign farmers still have the capacity to produce large 
crops and large volumes of livestock products that could exert 
downward pressure on agricultural prices and land values he 
added 
the usda analyst writing in the april issue of agricultural 
outlook magazine said that when the drought hit last summer many 
farmers needed more credit to cover expenses and gear up for the 
next season 
bankers are often accused of deserting farmers when times get 
tough but this apparently did not happen during and after the 
drought gajewski said 
in 1987 congress provided up to 4 billion to rescue the ailing 
farm credit system the national cooperative network of land banks 
production credit associations and other units that serve farmers 
drought relief last year added an additional 39 billion package 
huge outlays for government commodity support programs have 
pumped billions of dollars into the farm economy reaching a record 
258 billion just three years ago 
when combined with rebounding farmland values the recent 
rescue of the fcs and other changes in the farm credit delivery 
system including an overhaul of farmers home administration loan 
policies the good news about credit availability raises questions 
about how much credit farmers should use gajewski said 
some financial analysts he said are concerned that the recent 
rise in farmland values may not be supported by future returns the 
boom of the 1970s was followed by a collapse in land values 
during the early and mid1980s all of the inflation adjusted 
gains to farmers from the 1970s land price runup were lost 
gajewski said 
agricultural banks in the severe drought areas began 1988 in a 
stronger position and made relatively more loans through the 
droughts summer peak than banks did in other areas he said for 
example loan volume in the drought areas grew by 47 percent to 7 
percent from the end of 1987 to mid1988 compared with a 29 
percent growth at agricultural banks elsewhere 
more than half of the nations roughly 4500 agricultural banks 
commercial banks that specialize in farm finance are located in 
counties hit hardest by last years drought 
gajewski said the picture for the farm credit system is less 
clear most of the drought damage was in fcs multistate districts 
having headquarters in st paul minn louisville ky and omaha 
neb 
performing loans those without late payments or collateral 
problems grew in volume by 26 percent in the three districts 
during the first half of 1988 compared with a 47 percent growth 
systemwide 
in general lenders are willing and able to make new loans to 
farmers when they believe agricultural prospects look good he 
said lower wheat and soybean stocks and the consequent runup 
in commodity prices have given farmers and their lenders reason 
for optimism 
a recent survey of a agricultural bankers in the chicago federal 
reserve district showed that farmland value rose an average of 115 
percent in 1988 up a fifth from the depressed level of 1986 he 
said and a minneapolis federal reserve district survey in december 
showed cropland values up 57 percent from a year earlier 
farms in both the chicago and minneapolis districts were hit 
hard by the drought gajewski said apparently the drought did 
not markedly weaken the already rebounding land market in part 
this is because land values reflect expectations about the lands 
future earning power not just current earning power 
another factor in making farm credit cheaper and easier to 
deliver is the new federal agricultural mortgage corporation or 
farmer mac which is a secondary market for agricultural real 
estate loans and rural housing 
gajewski said farmer mac will allow lenders to originate and 
service fixedrate and flexiblerate longterm mortgages without 
keeping the loans on their books by selling mortgages in the 
secondary market lenders will be able to pass on much of the risks 
while keeping the origination and servicing fees 
the farmer mac loan sales are ultimately guaranteed by the 
federal government although lenders selling loans will have to 
maintain or contribute to a small reserve against future losses he 
said 
farmer mac can benefit farmers but the loan standards it sets 
will determine its effectiveness gajewski said 
if the standards are too tight only the lowestrisk loans will 
be sold and the new market will not have much effect if theyre 
too loose lenders will be able to pass highrisk farm loans on to 
nonfarm investors with federal backing 
this would encourage farmers to take on more debt leaving 
them more vulnerable to the vicissitudes of weather the general 
economy and international markets he said

when 448 farm households on the philippine 
island of mindanao switched to raising sugar for sale to the united 
states their earnings per acre grew to nearly double those of 
their neighbors 
the cash crop brought the equivalent of just over 100 an acre 
in a year compared with about 52 an acre for the corn grown by 
neighboring families these were poor families with farms that 
averaged only about 10 acres in a country where the average 
citizen earns about 660 a year the difference was huge 
contrary to conventional wisdom farmers who produce crops for 
export have more income and are better fed than subsistence farmers 
who produce only basic food crops for home consumption said the 
international food policy research institute an independent study 
organization 
the institute project was run by joachim von braun a west 
germam farm economist with a grant from the us governments 
agency for international development 
the study found at least one bad effect from the contracts 
offered by the bukidnon sugar co some corn farmers sold their 
land or gave up leases and took jobs on sugar farms creating a new 
group of landless farm workers 
von braun suggested that the philippine government should have 
gotten the mill to make contracts for sugar with the tenant 
farmers as well as with those who owned land the government could 
also have taken measures to improve the production of small farms 
that stayed with growing corn making credit fertilizer and new 
varieties available he said 
contrary to some peoples belief the researchers saw no damage 
to child health but little improvement either from the change 
to cash crops 
while better income from the sugar provided more food for the 
family it did little to solve the problem of badly nourished 
children better health and sanitation measures are needed as well 
the report said 
von braun said that as farmers income rose the proportion they 
spent on traditional foods went down spending on meat housing 
transport and education rose sharply among the most prosperous 
farmers in the philippine group 
von braun studied farmers not only in the philippines but also 
in the east african republic of kenya who made a similar switch 
and guatemalans who tried vegetables instead of corn 
there were also groups in two more african countries who 
switched to farming for the market rather than for home 
consumption in central african rwanda they planted potatoes and 
tea instead of corn in gambia on the atlantic coast the shift 
was from swamp rice to peanuts and to rice under irrigation 
the researchers found that when small farmers switched to cash 
crops they often kept some of their land in traditional food crops 
as a kind of insurance 
the study said that makes sense because the income from cash 
crops is not always certain sugar prices have dropped from the 
levels that first made the switch attractive in the philippines 
for example

hope for a wetter summer is blossoming in the 
wake of recent coastal rains but drought continues in several 
sections of the nation 
wheatgrowing areas of kansas and adjacent texas and oklahoma 
remain particularly dry and area legislators have already begun to 
complain about lack of concern in washington 
in the northeast meanwhile a dry winter left reservoirs low 
threatening water supplies in parts of new york new jersey 
pennsylvania and other parts of the delaware river basin 
new york mayor edward koch declared a drought emergency and 
imposed strict wateruse limits last week citing low reservoir 
levels that have not been replenished by winter snowfalls though 
recent rains may help some 
recalling low river flows that restricted shipping in the 
nations midsection last year the navigation season on the 
missouri river is being shortened by five weeks to allow water to 
be held in reserve at reservoirs which are only about 60 percent 
full 
david miskus of the national oceanic and atmospheric 
administrations climate analysis center reports that storms along 
the gulf and east coasts have helped ease the dryness there 
somewhat in recent days and more moisture is expected in the 
pacific coast states 
incoming storms could also bring some needed moisture to the 
middle of the nation this week miskus said 
the longterm outlook through midapril calls for above normal 
precipitation in the pacific northwest the great lakes and the 
northeast 
but that projection also indicates below normal rain in georgia 
florida and adjacent states and in a large area including wyoming 
south dakota nebraska kansas colorado new mexico and northern 
texas and oklahoma some of those areas are badly in need of 
moisture 
over the winter fierce winds eroded nearly 47 million acres of 
land in the great plains one of the most extensive losses on 
record according to an agriculture department survey 
much of this damage is due to the drought said wilson 
scaling chief of the departments soil conservation service we 
went into the wind erosion season with poor cover in much of the 
great plains because of the drought then this winter weve had a 
combination of no snow cover and highvelocity winds in many 
areas 
in addition to the land damaged during the fourmonth period 
scaling said more than 225 million acres were in condition to 
blow as of march 1 the most in 32 years highest on the list are 
kansas north dakota and texas he said 
farm state lawmakers meanwhile say the department of 
agriculture is mishandling last years emergency drought relief and 
ignoring this years arid potentially disastrous conditions on the 
high plains 
rep pat roberts rkan said the central part of the country 
is blowing away but help is not forthcoming from washington 
because of the bush administrations slow pace in filling key 
policy jobs at usda 
as of feb 28 more than 558000 producers have received 
disaster payments and emergency feed assistance amounting to more 
than 27 billion responded milton hertz of the agriculture 
department 
on the other hand along a wide belt from texas to kentucky 
moisture has been excessive in recent months said agriculture 
department meteorologist doug lecomte 
despite some flooding that moisture was badly needed in a 
region that has suffered drought for several years lecomte said 
he said the northern plains are in much better shape than last 
year with snow and rain providing beneficial wetness for montana 
the dakotas and the great lakes region this winter although some 
subsoils remain dry 
good snow and rains have also wetted down the ohio valley and 
western portions of the corn belt said lecomte the main spring 
planting areas were off to a pretty good start 
california especially southern california remains dry said 
lecomte 
he said moisture also remains a problem for the pacific 
northwest things are looking better but the area still has a lot 
of rain to make up following three dry winters 
miskus reports that despite recent improvements southern 
california received less than half of the normal amount of rainfall 
between dec 1 and march 18 
other regions with less than half of normal wetness for the 
winter include most of new england and eastern new york state 
parts of new jersey pennsylvania the gulf coast southern 
florida northern florida and parts of georgia and south carolina 
northern missouri southern arizona and new mexico most of kansas 
and parts of north texas northern new mexico and western oklahoma

the environmental protection agency says the 
hunt to find substitutes for ozonedepleting chemicals will go much 
quicker without strict government regulation of the chemical 
industry 
epa spokesman chris rice said the agencys policy is voluntary 
cooperation instead of strong government control because epa 
has received excellent cooperation from the industry 
rice was reacting to a recent general accounting office report 
that concluded the epas policy is failing to ensure the safe 
testing of chemicals that will take the place of 
chlorofluorocarbons or cfcs 
by not starting the lengthy regulation process now epa will 
find itself unable to quickly restrict use of many substitutes 
shown to endanger human health and the environment the gao said 
the gao congress investigative agency said epa should use its 
powers to demand unpublished test results and quickly slap controls 
on substitutes believed to endanger the environment or humans 
the united states and the 12nation european community have 
pledged to ban chlorofluorocarbons by 1999 surpassing the goals 
of the 1987 montreal protocol which requires they be halved by the 
end of the century 
cfcs and related chemicals called halons are stable and 
nontoxic when released into the atmosphere but 10 to 100 years 
later when they rise 1520 miles to the stratosphere their 
chemical bonds are broken apart 
scientists say their chlorine atoms destroy ozone allowing more 
of the suns ultraviolet rays to reach earth causing more skin 
cancer and eye cataracts and suppressing human immune systems 
the recent general accounting office report called the decision 
to rely on voluntary cooperation a course that would allow eventual 
production of cfc alternatives by anyone in any amount and for 
any use without prior notification or an epa safety review 
but the epas rice countered we feel using that cooperative 
relationship is going to obtain the information we need on a much 
quicker track 
we have very great concern over toxicity testing rice said 
adding that epa has not ruled out using its full authority to 
regulate the industry if were not getting the cooperation we 
need 
its a question of how you do it as quickly as possible while 
everyone is clamoring for new compounds as quickly as possible 
said kevin fay of the alliance for responsible cfc policy 
representing cfc producers and users 
the concern is youve got some policy makers in congress 
saying weve got to go faster and you have regulatory structures 
that would slow it down he said comparing the dilemma to 
sitting at an intersection with both red and green lights 
the toxic substances control act allows epa not only to demand 
industrys test results but to order advance notice from any 
company planning to convert chemicals designed for other use into 
cfc substitutes 
given the importance of the safety issue we believe that 
epas approach to assessing the safety of cfc chemical 
substitutes should include the use of the two tsca authorities 
the gao said in a report requested by the chairman of the house 
energy and commerce committee john d dingell dmich 
the gao said dependence on voluntary cooperation is a mistake 
because epas previous attempt to gather testing information 
from cfc producers in december 1987 resulted in incomplete data 
by ordering the test results epa officials could determine if a 
chemical presented an unreasonable health or environmental risk 
and if so could require testing to determine the specific risks 
if necessary the agency could take actions ranging from 
labeling requirements to a complete ban 
advance notice of new uses for chemicals would let epa review 
the safety of these new uses and quickly control any substances 
posing a danger 
if epa determined the information was inadequate to ensure the 
safety of the new use the agency could require more testing and 
prevent the new use while data is gathered 
cfcs are used as coolants in refrigerators and freezers in 
home office and automobile air conditioners propellants in 
aerosols blowing agents for plastic foam products and insulation 
cleaning agents for metals and electronic equipment fastfood 
cartons and sterilizing agents for medical instruments 
related chemicals halons are used in fire extinguishers where 
foam or water treatment would not work ships planes military 
vehicles computer facilities telephone switching centers and 
libraries 
substitutes for cfcs will be tested for at least two more years 
before commercial production could begin fay said no substitutes 
have yet been found for halons

starvation and disease abduction and 
slavery are some of the atrocities that six years of civil war have 
inflicted on millions of people of southern sudan 
consider akwa karfath kawal a woman of african descent who fled 
hunger in her hometown of aweil and ended up in a squalid refugee 
area just outside muglad in western sudan 
armed arabs abducted her five sons en route she says forcing 
them into slavery as cattle herders 
another woman miriyal mayowin lost two toddlers to starvation 
and one to the arabs during the trek out of the south 
there is nothing in aweil but destruction and we were hungry 
so we left she said we ate shrubs as we walked but there 
was no water 
so many died 
more than 12000 refugees in this maze of huts made of sticks 
and plastic sheets tell similar tales 
dressed in rags these dinka tribesmen and their brethren in 
other camps have been changed by the war from cultivators and 
cattle breeders to paupers dependent on relief 
the dinka largest of sudans 115 tribes form the backbone of 
the rebel army they are christians and animists 
rebels began fighting in 1983 for more autonomy from the 
government which is dominated by the moslem arab majority in the 
north 
on sunday a new broadbased cabinet met for the first time in 
khartoum and endorsed a peace plan to end the war 
and in april the world will try to assuage the suffering of 
sudans people with an ambitious emergency relief program 
coordinated by the united nations 
relief workers for both western donor governments and private 
organizations say the 132 million program will save the lives of 
some of the hundreds of thousands of southern sudanese who face 
starvation 
but they say the outside world has neglected the war and its 
ruin for so long that a logistical nightmare will further 
complicate the already precarious security situation they doubt 
the logjams can be sufficiently overcome to prevent another 
disaster like last summer when at least 250000 people died after 
monsoon rains isolated them without food 
everyone agrees the need is real and urgent even the rebel 
sudan peoples liberation army though the rebels have refused a 
call by the united nations for a onemonth truce to let the food 
pass they have pledged not to attack supply convoys in certain 
protected corridors 
the plan is to stockpile 100000 tons of food medicine and 
other supplies in places accessible to 225 million southerners in 
both government and rebelheld areas the supplies are to be in 
place before the rainy season starts in may and paralyzes 
transportation 
its an enormous quantity and a short period of time said 
one relief worker above all this is sudan 
relief and government officials agreed to the plan for bringing 
in supplies by train plane nile river barge and truck convoy the 
government also promised to undo complicated bureaucratic 
procedures for the relief organizations 
for their part western relief workers offer endless stories 
about bureaucratic inefficiency generally on condition they not be 
identified 
a britishbased organization says it had to wait a year before 
four jeeps were cleared through sudanese customs 
a dutch diplomat says he tried to transfer 4 million in aid to 
the emergency operation he was handed forms to fill out and told 
that the transfer would probably take weeks 
much of the food must be transported to governmentheld southern 
areas on nile barges or trains however the barges and trains have 
made no more than one trip in the past year because of security 
problems and nervous railway workers 
the government says of sudans 22 million people 4 million are 
southerners it says half have been displaced by the war to camps 
in ethiopia or northern sudan and half still need relief in the 
south 
southerners however claim they are 6 million 
western relief workers suspect that the discrepancy 2 million 
people represents the number who died as a result of the war

improvements in the us trade deficit will 
stall out next year without major policy changes on the part of the 
bush administration posing grave economic dangers for america a 
research institute warned today 
the institute for international economics issued a report 
forecasting that americas trade deficit will begin rising again in 
1990 and will hit 150 billion by 1992 very near the alltime 
record imbalance of 154 billion set in 1987 
the projections are based on the current account the broadest 
measure of us trade it includes not only trade in merchandise 
but also trade in services primarily investment flows between 
countries 
in 1988 the current account deficit narrowed to 135 billion 
reflecting a surge in us merchandise exports the current 
account also known as the countrys balance of payments shows how 
much foreign investment will be needed to finance americas trade 
deficit 
unless something is done to jumpstart americas stalled trade 
improvement the united states already the worlds largest debtor 
country will see that debt top 1 trillion by 1992 the report 
predicted 
the us net debtor status means that american assets have been 
traded to foreigners to pay for imported items such as cars and 
television sets because of this foreigners now own more us 
investments than americans hold overseas 
william cline a senior fellow at the institute and the author 
of the report blamed the worsening trade picture on continuing 
high domestic demand in the united states which attracts imports 
and deflects american production away from export markets 
to correct the situation cline said it is essential that the 
bush administration reach agreement with congress on a credible 
program to meet the targets in the grammrudman deficitreduction 
law the law calls for the deficit to be cut by 40 billion 
annually until the budget is in balance by 1993 
cline said the bush administration also needs to abandon the 
exchange rate policy america has been pursuing since february 1987 
which has aimed at stabilizing the value of the dollar 
instead he said the new administration needs to convince its 
major trading partners in particular japan and west germany that 
further devaluation of the dollar is needed to boost americas 
competitiveness by making us exports cheaper on overseas markets 
cline said the dollar needs to drop by 25 percent in value 
against the japanese yen and by 20 percent in value against the 
west german mark 
such actions would put the trade deficit back on a declining 
path reducing it to an annual rate of around 50 billion by 1992 
cline said trying to eliminate the entire trade deficit is not 
really feasible 
to go all the way to a zero trade deficit would meet very 
stiff resistance from us trading partners cline said in an 
interview i think it will be a major challenge just to get it 
down from 150 billion to 50 billion annually 
cline warns as have other economists that higher and higher 
levels of us foreign debt will ultimately lower americas living 
standard as more and more resources are transferred to foreigners 
to pay interest payments on the debt 
such high levels of foreign borrowing also leave the us 
economy vulnerable to foreign investors who could suddenly decide 
they no longer want to hold us investments the study said 
the growing debt burdens run the risk of a collapse of 
confidence in the dollar triggering a further surge of inflation 
and interest rates and possibly a recession the report said 
at a minimum they would weaken americas future growth by 
requiring persistently high us interest rates to attract the 
needed foreign funds 
the cline study was based on computer models which simulated 
global trade flows based on various economic scenarios 
among the reports conclusions 
every percentage point boost in growth in the economies of 
americas major trading partners will result in a decline of 9 
billion to 13 billion in the us current account deficit by 1992 
every percentage point drop in the dollars exchange value 
against other currencies produces a trade improvement of between 8 
billion and 10 billion by 1992 as us goods are made more 
competitive on overseas markets 
each percentage point drop in americas economic growth rate 
produces 15 billion in improvements in the deficit by lowering the 
demand for imports 
clines study argues that major reductions in the federal budget 
deficit would dampen the growth of domestic demand thus cutting 
americas appetite for foreign goods 
the study said that if the bush administration and congress act 
quickly to implement the budget cuts it will allow the necessary 
shift from a consumptiondriven economy to an exportdriven economy 
without a recession 
the institute is a nonprofit research organization which 
analyzes international economic issues

the countrys chief opposition leader 
was picked at a weekend convention to run for president in may 1 
elections but his party vowed to boycott a new government in the 
event of election fraud 
domingo laino head of the authentic radical liberal party 
accepted his partys nomination sunday night and vowed in his 
speech to defend paraguays peasants and adopt economic policies to 
meet their needs 
we will work with the clean hands and moral strength of the 
people said laino 53 an economist and former university 
professor he was exiled for seven years by the recently deposed 
government of gen alfredo stroessner 
laino was expelled by stroessners government in 1981 after 
writing a book about the business activities of nicaraguan dictator 
anastasio somoza the nicaraguan a friend of stroessner was 
granted asylum in paraguay after his ouster in 1979 he was 
assassinated a year later on an asuncion street 
who is to say that on may 1 there will not be a new 
government composed of the glorious authentic radical liberal 
party said laino he was the only candidate proposed for the 
presidency at the convention 
laino was carried from the convention hall on the shoulders of 
supporters following his acceptance speech delegates also approved 
candidates for the house of deputies and senate 
the may 1 elections will pick a president to fill the four years 
remaining in the fiveyear term of stroessner who was ousted feb 
3 by gen andres rodriguez the coup leader who had served as an 
aide to stroessner declared himself provisional president 
dissolved congress and called for new elections 
the colorado party the countrys largest and bestorganized 
party has governed since 1947 it is expected to ratify rodriguez 
as its presidential candidate at a convention set for april 1 
we know that many sectors of the government harbor hidden 
intentions of legitimizing the current de facto government said 
laino a member of the house of deputies from 1967 to 1977 
in recent weeks the party has repeatedly criticized what it 
views as irregularities in voter registration and it has suggested 
the rodriguez government might be trying to steal the election 
stroessner who had led paraguay since a 1954 coup was elected 
to an eighth consecutive term in february 1988 elections widely 
regarded as fraudulent 
a plan adopted by lainos party calls for rejecting any seats 
won in congress if it deems the may 1 balloting to be fraudulent 
even if the elections are viewed as fair the party still would 
withdraw from congress if electoral law reforms and changes in 
voter registration lists are not made before municipal elections 
scheduled for october 1990 the party claims voter lists are 
inflated in favor of the colorado party 
it also conditioned its participation in congress on revocation 
of a law which allows a president to serve an unlimited number of 
terms it also demands repeal of two laws frequently used under 
stroessner to crack down on dissidents and a ban on soldiers 
belonging to political parties

computer games 
threedimensional maps and nature trails are being developed to 
help visitors understand how last years forest fires were actually 
useful 
spaceage techniques went into the production of some of the 
interpretive projects which were considered nine months ago when 
fires began consuming what would eventually consume nearly half of 
the 22 millionacre park 
around the first of july we began to realize that we were not 
only confronted with an incredible historymaking event in terms of 
fire suppression but with a virtually unprecedented educational 
opportunity as well said george robinson yellowstones chief 
naturalist 
forestry officials say the fires prompt rebirth in the 
wilderness clearing away the old dead and overgrown while making 
way for new vegetation and new wildlife habitats 
robinson worked with the national park services harpers ferry 
wva creative design center to develop exhibits and signs that 
will be located along yellowstones roads 
the projects were conceived as ways of helping people to 
better understand what happened in the summer of 1988 he said 
among them is an exhibit at grant village which was surrounded 
on three sides by flames from the snake complex of fires and on the 
fourth by yellowstone lake 
it will be about a 250000 exhibit on fire and fire 
ecology he said adding it could be installed by june he said 
it will include a video of the 1988 fire season 
also planned at the visitor center is a computerenhanced map of 
yellowstone that is being developed with the help of nasa 
technicians the map will give an eagles eye view of the park 
the map may be seen through a touchsensitive screen on a video 
monitor robinson said simply touch and fly north to south on a 
simulated overflight and actually see with computergenerated 
graphics what the area might have looked like on a given day during 
the summer of 1988 he said 
the development of a computer game will enable people to change 
various factors to affect the fires 
what if we had rain in adequate quantities in june july and 
august robinson asked explaining the concept what if we had 
not had the high winds unprecedented winds what if what if and 
what if so that a computer user could in effect change history 
but also duplicate the actual events of the summer 
some of the more traditional projects include nature trails that 
would wind through burned and unburned sections of yellowstone 
three oneway roads to lead motorists through burned and unburned 
areas a movie on the fires and a large pamphlet that would show a 
burned lodgepole pine forest with the animal life expected to be 
seen in the area after the fires 
the pamphlet will not be specific to yellowstone but also will 
show the effects of fire on the alaskan tundra the florida 
everglades and the sequoia forests in california 
there will be included as a matteroffact computer images 
of fires that were burning throughout the world during the same 
time he said a multimillionacre fire in china that was not 
even known about until very late in the year because the chinese 
and russians didnt make a big event out of it 
there were fires burning in the amazon basin and in africa 
that were started by man that dwarfed in magnitude the fires that 
burned in yellowstone 
robinson said he hopes the project in its entirety will be 
instructive to the role of fire as an element in our lives and 
the lives of the forest

a new agreement between the national security 
agency and a research arm of the commerce department aims to 
bolster their joint efforts to safeguard sensitive information 
handled by thousands of federal government computer systems 
the memorandum of understanding was signed late last week by the 
nsas director vice adm wo studeman and raymond g kammer 
acting director of the national institute of standards and 
technology 
under prodding from congress the two agencies have started 
working closely together to review computer security plans 
submitted by offices throughout the government for protecting 
systems containing sensitive but unclassified data 
the effort has been spurred by mounting concern over socalled 
computer viruses including a virus attack last november that 
crippled more than 6000 computers connected to the defense 
departments internet electronic network 
nist based in suburban gaithersburg md serves as a national 
reference and measurement laboratory for the physical and 
engineering sciences it performs a wide range of research intended 
to benefit us industry 
the supersecret nsa headquartered at fort meade md is the 
nations biggest intelligence agency with a work force topping 
60000 employees more than all other us spy agencies combined 
and a budget said to be upwards of 10 billion a year 
its main missions are eavesdropping on communications around the 
world encrypting us communications and cracking foreign codes 
as well as protecting the security of us computers and 
communications systems 
kammer said friday that the agreement provides a structure for 
discussions between nsa and us if there are issues that arise where 
there is a conflict between a classified or national security issue 
and regular civilian data issues by and large its a commitment 
by us to work together 
he noted that the nsas current position toward cooperating with 
nist under legislation signed into law early last year 
contrasted with the intelligence agencys previous attitude 
we went through a bad spot about a year ago kammer said 
there was a feeling by the thenmanagement of nsa that the 
computer security act was a problem something that they opposed 
the management team thats in there now has taken the 
philosophy that its the law of the land lets get it done thats 
been a big and refreshing change 
kammer told a congressional hearing last week that as of march 
13 the joint nistnsa review team had received 1543 computer 
security plans 74 from the pentagon and the remainder from 
civilian agencies 
the general accounting office said last september that federal 
agencies at that time had identified 53443 computer systems an 
estimated 52000 of them within the defense department containing 
sensitive data 
testifying before two house science subcommittees kammer said 
nist had been working with the justice department and nsa to 
establish an emergency response capability to deal with 
malicious software attacks such as computer viruses 
viruses are generally small strings of computer code that can be 
stealthily inserted into software programs and spread widely 
through electronic networks to cause computers to malfunction by 
clogging memory destroying or altering data or other actions 
for the current fiscal year i have redirected 200000 to 
start up an effort to coordinate responses to computer security 
incidents and to create an information clearinghouse kammer said 
appearing at the same hearing the nsas studeman said the 
pentagon has ordered his agency to pursue intensive research and 
development with the objective of identifying means to counter 
computer viruses 
today there are no known solutions that can guarantee 
protection of a system against malicious software he said 
but studeman added that we believe strongly that the proper 
use of trusted products coupled with sound system security 
management and increased funding and emphasis in the area of 
research and development offers the best hope for preventing 
detecting and containing such attacks 
provisions of the fourpage memorandum of understanding include 
nist will draw upon computer technical security guidelines 
developed by the nsa 
nist will request the nsas assistance on all matters related 
to cryptographic techniques 
nsa will carry out research and development programs in 
trusted technology telecommunications security encryption 
techniques and personal identification methods 
nsa will conduct assessments of the hostile intelligence 
threat to federal information systems and provide technical 
assistance and recommend endorsed products for application to 
secure systems against that threat 
nist and nsa will jointly review agency plans for the security 
and privacy of computer systems 
nist and nsa will maintain an ongoing open dialogue to 
ensure that each organization remains abreast of emerging 
technologies and issues affecting the security automated 
information systems

a canada goose seems to have fallen hard 
for a shetland pony a true wild goose chase says a stable hand 
mike gottsch who was working at the jump over the moon training 
center during spring break from college said the goose flew onto 
the ranch about a month ago and soon began following the pony 
through pastures it even ate corn from the ponys trough 
he just got attached to him and wont leave him alone 
gottsch said 
sometimes the goose honks hisses and bites the pony said stan 
miller who boards several horses at the stables but the bird also 
will tag along from pen to pen and sometimes rides on the animals 
back 
a silver identifying band often used by wildlife authorities is 
attached to the birds right leg gottsch said no one has contacted 
officials about the goose 
the unusual relationship has raised some eyebrows 
people they cant believe it gottsch said they think 
its a domestic weve raised or something

pope john paul ii decried religious 
oppression in his easter message and christian leaders worldwide 
groped for meaning in this world where as one put it the worst 
often does happen 
in czechoslovakia on sunday christians called for the pope to 
visit their communist nation in some parts of the soviet union 
people heard masses for the first time in years 
elsewhere sunday shells and rockets pounded beirut as lebanese 
christians commemorated easter in afghanistan about 30 members of 
the dwindling western community gathered for services 
about 180000 faithful crowded the vaticans st peters square 
for the popes message commemorating the resurrection of jesus 
christ 
in his 20minute speech in italian the pope lamented religious 
persecution exploitation of women degeneration of family life 
sectarian strife and lack of concern for the environment 
earlier sunday the pope squinting in the warm spring sun held 
a mass on the steps of st peters basilica 
calling easter the new passover a reference to the old 
testament account of the miraculous rescue of the jews in egypt 
the pope said god passes where there do not exist conditions 
worthy of a truly human life through lack of housing promiscuity 
vagrancy where selfishness withers the fruitfulness of marriage 
and the family breaks up 
he also decried violence against children and the shameful 
commerce of vicewhere women are still the main victim 
the pope devoted much of his message broadcast to 50 countries 
to places where consciences are oppressed where christs 
faithful cannot openly invoke him or suffer persecution because of 
their love of him 
he said easter proclaims a needed truth to todays world 
which in so many ways seems to be rushing headlong towards 
selfdestruction and death 
in jerusalem patriarch michel sabah issued an easter plea for 
peace and blamed politicians for the violence in the holy land 
we find the reality of the holy land a reality of death and 
suffering sabah the first palestinian to serve as roman 
catholic patriarch of the city told pilgrims at easter mass in the 
church of the holy sepulchre 
we find those who tell us each day we are hungry we are 
humiliated we are prisoners we have no schooling he said we 
find those who have died and those who have yet to die while the 
politicians take their time finding answers 
sabah alluded to the searing conflict between israel and the 
palestinians during a mass intoned in latin french and arabic on 
the site where christians believe jesus was resurrected 
sabah named bishop in january 1987 never directly mentioned 
the 15monthold palestinian uprising in the occupied west bank and 
gaza strip 
but his mention of the two peoples in this holy land and his 
repeated references to death clearly evoked the revolt in which 
more than 400 palestinians and 18 israelis have been killed 
in the soviet baltic republics of lithuania and latvia many 
christians celebrated the easter mass for the first time in years 
last year moscow handed back confiscated cathedrals to many 
communities after decades in government hands 
in czechoslovakia about 400 people gathered beneath the balcony 
of 89yearold roman catholic cardinal frantisek tomaseks baroque 
residence shouting long live our father and we want the 
holy father in a call for the polishborn pontiff to visit 
prague 
czechoslovakia is the only soviet bloc country where communist 
authorities have for decades blocked the appointment of religious 
leaders 
in britain archbishop robert runcie head of the church of 
england and the worlds leading anglican told a congregation at 
canterbury cathedral we live in a world in which the worst looks 
as if it is going to happen and the worst often does happen and 
yet out of the anguish and waste love and trust come in new 
forms 
a sober look at the world seems to raise more fear than 
hope runcie told the congregation at canterbury cathedral

following are excerpts from the official 
vatican translation in english of pope john paul iis easter sunday 
message which was delivered in italian 
in this passover is inscribed the new and eternal covenant the 
covenant of the god of life with man condemned to death the 
covenant with humanity the covenant with the world with the 
world which is the theater of the history of the human race with 
the world which christians believe was created and is kept in 
existence by the love of the creator with the world subject to the 
slavery of sin but which with defeat of the evil one by the 
disobedience of christ even unto death has been set free 
in christ crucified and risen this liberation remains in god for 
all human beings in christ crucified and risen the world has been 
restored to god so that it may be fashioned anew according to gods 
design and reach that fullfillment willed by god from all eternity 
 
over these tragedies and triumphs of todays world of the man 
of today god continues to pass through the resurrection of his 
son the son of man he passes and sets free as at the time of the 
exodus as at the moment when christ rises and transforms the 
world 
god passes and frees from the fear that oppresses so many of our 
brothers and sisters in the face of the uncertainty of the future 
everywhere in the world he passes where death expresses once more 
its horrors where suffering imprints its marks on flesh and on 
souls he passes where there do not exist conditions worthy of a 
truly human life through the lack of housing promiscuity 
vagrancy where selfishness withers the fruitfulness of marriage 
and the family breaks up where the innocence of children is 
exploited and corrupted where violence is done to their 
defenseless goodness where the shameful commerce of vice is 
carried on and women are still its main victim 
god passes and sets free the passover of the resurrection from 
the perils of intolerance whatever name it bears where the 
proclamation of easter has not reached or is hindered where 
consciences are oppressed where christs faithful cannot openly 
invoke him or suffers persecution because of the love of him and 
his church and because of their faithfulness to their rites and 
their own ageold religious traditions he passes in the countries 
where christians cannot gather about the altars to celebrate the 
eucharist where the flock waits for its own pastor whose guidance 
it misses and longs for 
for religious freedom though it is deeply felt by consciences 
and is written in the constitutions of states and in international 
conventions is often today trampled upon in many different ways 
god likewise passes where on the troubled and bloodstained horizon 
of various countries the longedfor peace is yet to be seen where 
men though they are brothers fight one another in a scene of 
destruction and hatred as is still happening in the beloved and 
tormented lebanon 
in his blood all is reconciled man with god with himself with 
nature at this point there gains new strength and awareness 
this is the truth which easter proclaims to todays world which 
in so many ways seems to be rushing headlong toward 
selfdestruction and death 
easter the passover of the lord lasts unchangeably it cannot 
be blotted out either in the history of the human race or in the 
history of the whole creation it lasts unchangeably christs 
resurrection has not been added to history it is the history 
the whole history of man which is inscribed in this unique day 
which the lord has made so that he can make all things new

the internal revenue service has a new 
question for you how long does it take to complete irs tax forms 
the irs spent five years and 19 million study to figure out 
that the average taxpayer should be able to fill out form 1040 the 
dreaded individual income tax return in exactly 3 hours and 7 
minutes 
this year for the first time irs instructions for more than 
350 tax forms includes an estimate of how long it takes to complete 
each one the notices also include the name and address of an 
official to contact if someone wants to complain about a form or 
dispute a time estimate 
the idea is that if enough people complain bureaucrats will 
feel pressured to simplify the forms or perhaps to shorten some 
or eliminate them altogether in the interest of easing the burden 
of government paperwork

a man underwent a successful kidney 
transplant after he was plucked by helicopter from a remote 
campsite and taken to a hospital for the organ that matched his 
rare blood type officials said 
charles ridgeway 47 was listed in critical but stable 
condition late sunday according to officials at western medical 
center in santa ana 
everything went just great his kidney is already showing 
early signs of function dr garo tertzakian said after he 
performed the twohour surgery earlier in the day 
ridgeway was camping with his wife and daughter in imperial 
county near the mexican border when doctors found a kidney donor 
whose blood type was bpositive shared by only about 15 percent of 
the population 
time was of the essence because organ must be transplanted 
within a certain time the organ was located saturday night and the 
ninehour search began 
charles ridgeway decided that he was going to go to the end of 
the earth said los angelesbased knxam radio pilot bob tur who 
found ridgeway after flying through a rainstorm and serendipitously 
picking up ridgeways son matt who also was looking for his 
father 
the older ridgeway an accounting manager at rockwell 
international in anaheim carried an electronic pager linking him 
to the hospital but his camping trip took him out of its range 
matt ridgeway had driven about 100 mph to the area where he 
thought his father might be 
tur who volunteered after he heard of ridgeways plight lifted 
off at 1 am sunday from santa monica airport with his friend jim 
king as copilot they picked up two orange county search and 
rescue team members along the way 
we were told if we dont find them by 4 am forget it tur 
said he said doctors explained the kidney would not be fresh 
enough to transplant if ridgeway could not be found and dialysis 
preparation started by 5 am and tur figured the trip to the 
hospital would take about an hour 
the search for ridgeways white motor home with two allterrain 
vehicles was not easy 
not only are there a thousand people in campers but theyre 
all white they all have atvs tur said we were yelling over 
the pa charles ridgeway we have a kidney identify yourself or 
notify the orange county sheriffs department 
they eventually saw a flash of light and found matt ridgeway 
whose truck had become trapped in sand tur said the crew picked 
up the younger ridgeway and took off again in a rainstorm 
just before 4 am in a large sand dune park near glamis matt 
ridgeway spotted his fathers mobile home 
the son leans over and says thats it tur said 
as the helicopter was landing the crafts night light went out 
but the five landed safely tur and the younger ridgeway ran up to 
the mobile home and banged on the door until a blearyeyed charles 
ridgeway woke up 
they told him there was no time for him to get fully dressed and 
flew him to a nurse and a small plane waiting on the ground at 
nearby brawley airport the plane took ridgeway to john wayne 
airport in orange county where a waiting ambulance took him to the 
hospital 
it was nervewracking said matt ridgeway

as its first act a new coalition cabinet 
has endorsed a tentative peace agreement with southern rebels and 
called for an immediate ceasefire in the countrys sixyear civil 
war 
sudans people are weary of war and the famine it has bred 
the peace plan adopted sunday endorses the controversial 
suspension of islamic laws a major demand of the rebels who are 
mostly christians and animists of african descent 
the cabinet also urged opening talks with the rebels who 
contend the moslem arab north treats them unfairly and have been 
fighting for increased autonomy 
the issue of islamic law has kept the countrys fundamentalist 
national islamic front from joining prime minister sadek mahdis 
coalition government which includes all other parties and interest 
groups 
the war costs the faltering economy 1 million a day and 
related famine has killed hundreds of thousands of southerners 
information and culture minister hussein abusaleh told 
reporters the cabinet has decided to form a committee to seek 
contacts with the rebel sudan peoples liberation organization 
the rebels led by col john garang signed the agreement nov 
16 with the centrist democratic unionist party then the senior 
partner in mahdis cabinet 
however the new government and rebels must now meet to work out 
how to impose a ceasefire and other details of the plan 
it calls for lifting the state of emergency in effect since 
president gaafar nimeiri was overthrown in april 1985 and a 
constitutional conference to negotiate peace 
initially mahdi refused to sign the agreement maneuvering to 
deprive the unionists of credit for reaching a settlement where his 
own party failed 
the unionists quit the government over the issue in december 
and mahdi replaced them with the islamic front 
that move coupled with a successful rebel offensive led the 
army to intervene it issued an ultimatum for mahdi to resign or 
form a broadbased cabinet to bring peace political parties and 
trade and professional unions supported the armys demands 
mahdi finally complied and swore in his new cabinet on saturday 
peace talks and a ceasefire if achieved would greatly help an 
international relief operation to send 100000 tons of food and 
supplies to the south before the rainy season starts in may 
the united nations has warned that 100000 to 600000 people 
could die in southern sudan this summer if the operation fails

to sen robert c byrd the united states 
senate over the last 200 years has been a rockbound channel able 
to contain the onrushing passions of the moment without losing its 
essential and original shape and purpose 
byrd in what he calls a labor of love has pursued that 
theme in a sevenpound history of the institution as it developed 
over the past two centuries 
the book called the senate 17891989 and available 
through the government printing office is a lavishly illustrated 
and meticulous account based on 42 of the 100 speeches byrd 
delivered on the floor of the senate in an unprecedented series 
that began on a spring morning in 1980 
one of my two granddaughters was in the gallery with other 
members of her fifthgrade class byrd recalls i decided i 
should mark the occasion by talking a little about the senate and 
its history for that class 
i had no notes i spoke for an hour he said 
on the next friday his older granddaughter was in the gallery 
and byrd decided to make another speech in her honor 
but i thought i ought to make a different speech so i talked 
about the traditions and the customs of the senate thats how it 
started that was the seed of the idea i determined there was 
fully enough material to do 100 speeches on the senate i saw that 
it was going to take a number of years 
for most of the next decade when the business of the senate had 
been completed for the day byrd rose to advance his project 
another notch delivering what a generation of senate clerks and 
pages and doorkeepers reporters and fellow senators came to call 
byrds history lessons 
the result is a narrative history of the senate from the 
uncertain first steps of the first congress in the late winter and 
spring of 1789 through the calamity of civil war in the 1860s and 
the senate watergate investigation of the 1970s 
the assembly of those speeches into a book was a 
minimanhattan project byrd says proudly noting that he 
proofread the book five times every comma every colon every 
emdash 
to byrd the most remarkable fact about the senates 200 years 
is the way that historic themes tend to repeat themselves 
is there concern over the negative tone of last years 
presidential campaign he asks 
then consider byrd says the campaign of 1828 when the 
partisans of john quincy adams called rival andrew jackson a 
gambler a drunkard and a duelist as well as an adulterer and 
jackson supporters retaliated in kind portraying adams as a 
monarchist a gourmandizer and a spendthrift 
slander was infectious byrd says 
this years 101st congress opened with a donnybrook over a 
proposed large congressional pay raise 
old hat says byrd 
pay squabbles date to the first congress and began in earnest in 
1816 when it was proposed that the pay rate of 6 a day be changed 
to a 1500 a year 
the result public outrage 
the further result according to byrd in the next election 
twothirds of the members of the house were defeated several 
senators were also defeated and some resigned rather than stand for 
reelection 
also this year the senate tied itself into emotional knots over 
presidents bushs nomination of former sen john tower of texas to 
be secretary of defense a battle that led to towers defeat 
nothing new in that says byrd 
on a march day in 1843 president john tylers nomination of 
rep caleb cushing of massachusetts to be secretary of the treasury 
was rejected three times in three roll call votes on a single day 
the senate was in a nasty mood that day it twice rejected 
tylers nomination of rep henry wise of virginia to be minister to 
france and defeated his nominees to head the navy and war 
departments and scuttled his nominee as minister to brazil 
to top things off the senate rejected tylers nomination of 
john spence for a seat on the us supreme court 
bushs experience with the tower nomination cant compare to 
that byrd says 
byrd said he hopes his history which is available from the 
government printing office will be a contribution to the 
institutional memory of the place 
nothing has changed in 200 years byrd said the senate is 
still guided by the constitution and the knowledge that everything 
that comes before it is just a new set of circumstances come to 
center stage

virginia is going to have the first state 
laboratory in the nation with a data bank of genetic prints which 
allow police to nab criminals from scanty physical evidence like 
saliva left at a crime scene 
the virginia division of consolidated laboratory services will 
provide dna testing for the states police and sheriffs 
departments beginning may 1 
dna testing is the most significant development for law 
enforcement since fingerprinting and that dates back about 100 
years said paul b ferrara director of the state bureau of 
forensic science 
the lab will develop a computerized data bank of dna prints of 
sex offenders in the state state legislation passed last month 
requires sex offenders to submit blood samples for dna analysis 
dna deoxyribonucleic acid is found in the chromosomes of 
cells including saliva hair blood semen tissue and bone 
marrow only identical twins can have the same dna pattern or 
genetic blueprint 
scientists in recent years have developed technology for taking 
dna from body fluids or tissue left at a crime scene and matching 
it with the genetic blueprint of a suspect 
if a rapist leaves seminal fluid at the scene he might as 
well be leaving his social security card ferrara said 
he said dna testing already helped nabbed one person in virginia 
timothy spencer of richmond who was convicted of three capital 
murders on the basis of genetic printing 
im not a lawyer but based on what ive been told timothy 
spencer probably never would have been convicted without the dna 
testing ferrara said the case is under review by the state 
supreme court 
ferrara said dna testing also could serve as a criminal 
deterrent he said criminals can be careful not to leave 
fingerprints as spencer was but the chances of committing a 
violent crime without leaving a dna sample are slim 
predna analysis of body fluids tissue and hair left at crime 
scenes consisted of examining enzymes and blood types processes 
which only narrowed the list of possible perpetrators 
conventional serological evidence was always circumstantial 
ferrara said you could say that a particular sample could have 
come from say 13 percent of the male population but with dna 
testing you can say this sample definitely came from that person 
its just like fingerprints in that respect 
dna is inherited with each parent contributing onehalf for 
about 10 years scientists have used dna testing to establish 
paternity and to research genetically related diseases 
about three years ago dna testing was first used to solve a 
rape in a small town in england ferrara said the technology has 
since been used to solve several crimes in the united states but 
virginia is among the first states to implement widespread dna 
testing 
two virginia serologists were trained in dna testing at a lab in 
new york and ferrara received 80000 from the state for equipment 
and supplies 
last year ferrara secured an additional 200000 in state funds 
to keep the program going

the release of randall dale adams who once was 
three days from execution for a crime he long claimed he didnt 
commit has put the spotlight on a judicial system that imprisoned 
the thin blue line defendant 
dallas police prosecutors and judges have lost some 
credibility with the public and the only thing that will restore it 
is time if they can demonstrate they will not be as zealous and 
rabid as they demonstrated this past week said adams 
attorney randy schaffer 
adams who spent 12 years in prison was freed last week on 
grounds he received an unfair trial dallas county district 
attorney john vance dropped the charges saying there wasnt enough 
evidence to retry adams for the 1976 slaying of dallas police 
officer robert wood 
vance soon found himself on the defensive trying to explain why 
his department had failed to examine adams case before and fought 
court orders to free adams 
defense attorneys and others are questioning how the case was 
handled from the time prosecutors suppressed evidence at the 1977 
trial to an assistant district attorneys contention last week that 
judges who ruled in adams favor should be disqualified because of 
their liberal beliefs 
do we have within the prosecutors department people who do 
not really understand or respect the rule of law the dallas 
times herald questioned in an editorial saturday is that the 
lesson of the adams case if it is then no one in the 
community is separated from the fate of randall adams by more than 
the thinnest of whims 
the editorial called for vance to heal the district attorneys 
office of a strong and dangerous streak of abuse and fanaticism 
vance maintains the criminal justice system did not fail adams 
i think mr adams would be the first to admit to you that the 
criminal justice system works vance said if it didnt he 
would be on death row 
adams was three days from the electric chair in 1980 but the 
us supreme court ruled his jury had been improperly selected 
instead of seeking a retrial thendistrict attorney henry wade 
persuaded gov bill clements to commute adams sentence to life in 
prison 
one has to question if they were convinced randall dale adams 
was a cop killer why didnt they go back a second time and get the 
death penalty said peter lesser a dallas defense attorney 
it was just such questions that prompted film maker errol morris 
to reexamine adams case in the 1988 documentary the thin blue 
line 
the film showed prosecution witness david harris recanting his 
testimony that adams was the trigger man as well as other 
witnesses giving information that conflicted with their testimony 
harris now is on death row for an unrelated murder 
wade retired in 1986 but the neverquit reputation of his 
office carried on with winfield scott the assistant district 
attorney who fought against retrial or release for adams 
earlier this year state district judge larry baraka recommended 
that adams get a new trial or be set free the texas court of 
criminal appeals concurred 
baraka last week ordered adams released on a 50000 personal 
recognizance bond adams spent an extra night in jail however 
after scott tried to have baraka removed from the case and adams 
bail increased to a 100000 cash bond 
scott acknowledged he had not read the opinions of the appellate 
court and baraka but said it was clear baraka and eight of the 
nine appellate judges were liberal and biased toward adams 
another state district judge denied scotts arguments and 
cleared adams release 
scott was not in his office when called by the associated press 
prosecutors have consistently declined to comment on the case wade 
did not return messages from the ap 
vance said he will order a transcript of the recent hearings 
including scotts testimony and look into it as a personnel 
matter but he defended scott saying he has done an outstanding 
job for years 
adams attorney said prosecutors were right to investigate adams 
aggressively but could have handled the complex case better 
its that hard case that really is a measure of the quality of 
a justice system and in this case they failed miserably schaffer 
said

less than an hour after former texas 
death row inmate randall dale adams discussed his newly gained 
freedom on national television last week the state put another 
inmate to death 
the timing wasnt lost on the nearly 300 condemned men who 
remain on the row the nations second largest who argue that 
adams may not have been the only one who was wrongly convicted 
theyre talking about this guy getting off death row and 
heres some guy getting executed the same time and theyre not 
talking about that said convicted killer james beathard 
i see a whole lot of conflicting signals to the public said 
beathard it should be obvious to people theyre going to kill 
some innocent people out there 
leon rutherford king who was convicted of a houston murder 11 
years ago was executed by lethal injection last wednesday shortly 
after adams appeared on abctvs nightline program texas has 
executed 30 inmates since the us supreme court restored the death 
penaly in 1976 more than any other state 
adams was the subject of the thin blue line a documentary 
that questioned his 1977 conviction for killing a dallas police 
officer 
he came within three days of death in 1980 before his sentence 
was commuted to life in prison adams was freed last week under a 
texas court of appeals ruling that said he didnt receive a fair 
trial because prosecutors suppressed evidence and witnesses lied on 
the stand prosecutors in dallas said they wouldnt retry him 
isnt it nice that adams gets relief and then we continue on 
with the executions said lester bower another death row 
convict how many mistakes have to be pointed out and discovered 
how many do you have to see before someone says well just 
how many could there be and if there can be can we justify 
continuing executing 
king like many of the 29 inmates who preceded him to the texas 
death chamber since the state resumed executions in 1982 had a 
second trial after his first conviction and death sentence were 
thrown out on a technicality 
a number of men with cases similar to his mine included had 
adams issues says billy hughes whose conviction and death 
sentence for the slaying of a state trooper were reversed unlike 
adams however hughes was tried again convicted again and 
sentenced to death again 
the most famous contested death row case is that of clarence 
brandley a black man facing execution for the 1980 rapeslaying of 
a white teenage girl 
he was convicted and sentenced to die in a second trial after 
his first ended with a hung jury but a state district judge has 
recommended that the court of appeals grant a new trial saying his 
conviction and sentencing were marred by racial prejudice perjured 
testimony and a biased investigation the appeals court is 
reviewing the case 
bob walt the assistant attorney general who handles capital 
cases in texas said the cases of adams and brandley show that the 
system catches trial and prosecutor errors and ensures innocent 
people arent put to death 
you obviously have some fear at some point but that fear 
diminishes over time as more and more judges see and review the 
case said walt the system eliminates any realistic 
possibility that innocent people would be executed 
walt also understands the inmates distaste for what his office 
does 
i wouldnt like anyone whos trying to get me killed he 
said

a highseas standoff between the coast guard and 
250 usbound haitians packed aboard a rickety 50foot sailboat 
ended peacefully after a 30hour confrontation that included 
threats babies would be thrown overboard 
the haitians agreed sunday to the leave the boat and be returned 
to their country no injuries were reported 
one refugee woman was rescued after leaping into the sea and 
others vowed to throw their infant children overboard unless they 
were allowed to continue toward the united states said coast guard 
petty officer gary starks 
it was really an ordeal and there were some very tense 
moments said starks there was no idea what would happen and 
none of the haitians had life jackets there was a potential for a 
significant loss of life 
the sailboat was discovered about 9 am est saturday by the 
coast guard cutter escape which was transporting nearly 100 
haitians intercepted the previous day back to the impoverished 
nation officials said 
a rope was used to immobilize the rudder of the refugee vessel 
and four other coast guard cutters were sent to the scene before 
the haitians surrendered about 120 miles southeast of miami starks 
said 
the cutters escape and steadfast were traveling toward 
portauprince today coast guard officials said 
starks said none of the refugees had weapons and no one was 
injured although three ill haitians were transported to the coast 
guard base in miami beach some of the haitians aboard the escape 
refused to eat in an act of sympathy with the other refugees he 
said 
the standoff revealed the growing frustration driving record 
numbers of refugees to seek floridas shores a haitian leader said 
this incident is just a hint of what could become common 
said the rev gerard jeanjuste director of the haitian refugee 
center in miami and a spokesman for the citys haitian community 
some of those on the boats are army defectors and will do just 
about anything to keep from going back to haiti jeanjuste said 
jeanjuste said the influx of central american immigrants into 
south florida is fueling resentment among haitians who are 
routinely returned to their homeland after being stopped at sea 
under immigration and naturalization service policy brief 
hearings are held with refugees intercepted at sea and only those 
deemed political asylum candidates are allowed to enter the united 
states other socalled economic refugees are returned to their 
native country 
only five of the more than 20000 haitians interviewed at sea 
since 1981 have been brought into the country for asylum hearings 
this month about 1400 haitians have been stopped at sea more 
than any other month in the eightyear interdiction program

government prosecutors said today that 
a dissident leader who made an unauthorized visit to communist 
north korea to discuss reuniting the two koreas will be arrested if 
he returns to seoul 
in a separate action police detained 23 dissident writers and 
supporters who tried to reach the north korean border today for a 
reunification meeting with communist delegates at the panmunjom 
truce site 
seoul officials had prohibited the meeting 
prosecutor bae jaewook said the rev moon ikhwan would face 
prosecution under tough national security laws for making his 
unauthorized visit to the north to meet top communist officials 
moon could face up to 10 years imprisonment if convicted 
moons surprise arrival saturday in pyongyang after a trip to 
japan and china shocked capitalist south korea the two koreas are 
bitter rivals who have clashed repeatedly and their border is 
sealed 
south korean officials criticized moon for a speech he made in 
pyongyang describing north korean leader kim il sung as a 
respectable president 
kim who rules one of the worlds most repressive police states 
is widely feared in the south for having started the korean war 
many south koreans believe he still wants to conquer their country 
unification minister lee hongkoo said moons unauthorized visit 
was an attempt to undermine president roh taewoos efforts to 
improve relations with north korea lee said moons visit aided 
north korea by giving the impression that some south koreans 
support the pyongyang government 
south korean dissidents rejecting their governments efforts to 
improve relations with the north have been trying to start a 
dialogue with the north on reuniting the peninsula the dissidents 
claim to speak for people in the south despite their lack of public 
support 
prowestern south korea and communist north korea were divided 
at the end of world war ii and fought the korean war from 1950 to 
1953 they are technically still at war because no peace treaty was 
signed and more than 1 million heavily armed soldiers face each 
other across the 150mile border 
roh ordered a major crackdown last week on radical groups after 
charging they were attempting to stage a leftist revolution 
government officials said moons visit was part of those attempts 
to undermine the administration 
dissident groups calling for rohs overthrow have been staging 
violent protests but they are not viewed as a major threat to the 
government 
roh last week indefinitely postponed a promised referendum on 
his performance citing a threat of radical violence 
senior south korean army commanders deplored moons visit at a 
meeting today and demanded he be punished yonhap the south korean 
news agency reported 
the main opposition parties all said today that moon should not 
have gone to north korea without government permission 
however the united national democratic movement the souths 
main dissident alliance expressed support for moon at a press 
conference 
we hope he will return home with fruitful results the 
alliance said in a press statement 
the two koreas have been holding intermittent talks since last 
august on improving relations little progress has been made 
because each side has tended to push its own proposals and ignore 
the others initiatives

the wife of a navy captain who mistakenly shot 
down an iranian airliner with 290 people on board began appearing 
on television today in spots aimed at finding whoever planted a 
bomb that destroyed her van 
authorities believe the bomb which exploded while sharon rogers 
was driving the van on march 10 might have been the work of 
terrorists 
we dont know who did it we just must realize that someone is 
out there who committed a very cowardly act said mrs rogers 
whose husband uss vincennes capt will c rogers iii on july 3 
gave the order to fire on the jetliner when it was misidentified by 
ship radar operators as an attacking iranian warplane iran vowed 
revenge 
together as a community we have to find out who it is so that 
a carbombing doesnt happen to anybody else mrs rogers said 
in a videotaped interview for crime stoppers 
it could be me last week you tomorrow she said 
the spot which is intended to help find witnesses includes a 
reenactment of mrs rogers scrambling out of her van seconds 
before it burst into flames 
my life has been threatened and that of my family has been 
threatened she said i have lost my job i cant go back to my 
home and my life has completely done a turnaround 
mrs rogers shadowdarkened front is obscured by electronic 
scrambling in the video which contains the most extensive public 
statement she or her husband has made about the bombing 
during the interview not all of which will be shown in the 
crime stoppers segment mrs rogers describes what happened as she 
was waiting at a san diego intersection while driving to work 
i had been sitting at the red light maybe 20 30 seconds when 
i felt that i had been rearended by a car going very fast 
said mrs rogers who was not injured 
at the same ime i heard an explosion i opened up the door i 
smelled something burning i got my seat belt off as quickly as i 
could i jumped out and ran around the back end of the van where i 
saw the back third of my van on fire 
mrs rogers and her husband have been in protected seclusion 
since the bombing which the fbi is investigating possible motives 
that agents have said theyre checking include retaliation for the 
downed iranian airliner 
a week after the bombing mrs rogers was dismissed from her job 
of 12 years at la jolla country day school which was the target 
the same week of a telephoned bomb threat that turned out to be a 
hoax 
in a letter received saturday by parents of students at the 
exclusive private school headmaster timothy burns said mrs rogers 
was not allowed to return partly because of concerns that her 
presence would create a military atmosphere and disrupt the campus 
learning environment 
crime stoppers is a nonprofit organization that works with law 
enforcement agencies to offer rewards to people who provide 
anonymous tips that help solve crimes featured in weekly segments 
shown on local television stations as a public service 
a total of 37000 has been pledged to the reward fund in the 
rogers case including 25000 from an anonymous san diego 
developer and 1000 from the vincennes crew said molly wilson 
cartmill executive director of the san diego chapter of crime

dread scott he is an unpatriotic snot he knows not what this 
country is about 
vietnam museum owner joe hertel said he contacted mann and asked

president corazon aquino said today 
on the eve of nationwide village elections that procommunist 
candidates who are voted into office in the balloting can serve if 
they are freely and fairly chosen 
the military claims the rebels will use the vote to expand their 
base 
also today the rebels claimed they have recovered from setbacks 
suffered during mrs aquinos administration and police said three 
men shot up the home of an anticommunist activist near cebu 
killing three people including the mans wife 
on tuesday voters in the countrys 42000 villages or 
barangays will select about 287567 local council members 
the military claims the rebels are backing promarxist 
candidates in hopes of solidifying their control in thousands of 
rural villages 
mrs aquino was asked if the government would prevent rebel 
supporters from claiming council seats the communist party of the 
philippines is banned but tuesdays balloting is supposed to be 
nonpartisan 
well if they have been elected legitimately there has been 
no force they will hold office mrs aquino told reporters we 
have to abide by the law 
col gerardo flores intelligence chief of the philippine 
constabulary said the rebels hope to capture 60 percent of the 
village council seats in areas under their control 
the rebels claim to control about 8500 villages nationwide but 
the commission on election puts the figure at about 2800 the 
difference is believed to be in definitions of control 
in remote inaccessible areas there is hardly any government 
presence said election commissioner haydee yorac so the party 
members are the ones who exercise the most serious influence 
hilario davide chairman of the election commission said troops 
would be deployed in about 3500 districts considered hot spots 
in a statement marking wednesdays 20th anniversary of the 
communist new peoples army rebel chief of staff romulo kintanar 
claimed a force of 30000 fighters deployed in 65 of the 
philippines 73 provinces 800 of 1500 cities and 12000 villages 
and neighborhoods 
npa units have largely recovered from setbacks in 1985 and 
1986 and have reconstituted guerrilla formations which had been 
reduced for a time kintanar said 
civilian and military authorities claim the rebels are losing 
strength because of more effective counterinsurgency operations and 
improvements in the philippine economy 
they also maintain that the rebels lost much of their appeal 
following the february 1986 ouster of president ferdinand marcos 
authoritarian administration and the rise of mrs aquino to power 
mrs aquino has vowed to crush the insurgents before her term 
expires in 1992 the new peoples army was founded on march 29 
1969 by leftist intellectuals and remnants of the prosoviet huk 
guerrillas who waged an unsuccessful insurgency in the 1950s and 
1960s 
kintanar was captured in march 1987 but escaped last year from 
the stockade at manilas camp crame after attending a birthday 
party for his former jailer 
in cebu 350 miles south of manila police and witnesses said 
gunmen late sunday sprayed semiautomatic rifle fire on the home of 
rogelio nara 37 in the village of kanirag in the mountains above 
the city 
naras wife and two male relatives were killed and two others 
were wounded including naras nineyearold daughter police said 
nara is a member of the movement for democratic reforms one of 
hundreds of governmentbacked anticommunist vigilante groups 
operating nationwide 
police said the attackers could have been rebels or relatives of 
a man killed by nara several years ago

the dollar rose against the japanese yen today 
while stock prices lost ground on the tokyo stock exchange 
the dollar closed at 13230 yen up 103 yen from last fridays 
close the us currency opened at 13168 yen and moved in a range 
of 1316713230 yen 
the dollar opened slightly higher than last fridays close of 
13127 yen but active buying of the dollar by insurance companies 
pushed it further currency dealers said 
they attributed the dollars bullishness to the markets reduced 
wariness toward rising interest rates 
there seem to be no strong incentive to sell the dollar right 
now said masato sanjo a dealer at the tokyo office of 
manufacture hanover trust the bullish dollar appears to have 
become more like a longterm trend 
another currency dealer with the bank of tokyo said there was 
some demand for the dollar in early trading but otherwise the 
market was very quiet as most overseas markets were observing a 
threeday easter holiday from last friday 
the nikkei stock average of 225 selected issues a 2014point 
loser last friday shed another 5612 points or 018 percent to 
close at 3151240 
on the stock market dealers said the anticipation of the 
introduction of the capitalgain tax starting april 1 led to heavy 
sale of shares resulting in a lower nikkei index 
investors currently pay a 055percent securities tax when 
selling shares but from april 1 they will pay 13 percent in 
taxes 1 percent in capital gain tax and 03 percent for the 
securities tax 
also in anticipation of the indictment of former chairan of 
nippon telegraph and telephone corp for bribery charges in a 
stocktrading scandal ntt shares closed at an all time low of 153 
million yen its previous low was 158 million marked on last 
wednesday 
but dealers expressed optimism saying market environments are 
not as bad as the nikkei indicates 
the fact that nikkei fell only less than 02 percent despite 
all the bad news indicates the deepdown bullishness of the 
market said a dealer at a major brokerage in tokyo once all 
the bad news is out it will be time for the spring rally

an experiment scientists hope will shed 
light on the cause of motion sickness in zero gravity and the loss 
of bone mass in astronauts continues this week as more space 
chicks hatch 
the first of a group of baby chicks to hatch from eggs that took 
a fiveday space ride aboard the space shuttle discovery pecked 
through his shell friday night at kentucky fried chicken 
headquarters here 
kentucky fried chicken is the sponsor of the experiment that is 
the brainchild of purdue university senior john vellinger 
the first space chick hatched less than a week after the eggs 
took their ride seven more space chicks and eight from a control 
group that remained on the ground also hatched friday and saturday 
another eight eggs that traveled in space and eight more control 
eggs are to hatch this saturday 
vellinger said the experiment was designed to measure the 
effects of a weightless environment on embryo development 
vellinger 23 designed an incubator that was launched aboard 
discovery on march 13 it carried 32 chicken eggs a similar 
incubator with a control group of 32 eggs was kept on the ground 
during the period that discovery was in space 
vellinger and a group of scientific advisers will study the 
chicks during the next year and then prepare a paper assessing the 
results 
the other half of the 64 eggs from space and the control group 
were opened by vellinger and his five advisers after the shuttle 
landed to examine the embryos at that stage in their development 
ronald hullinger a professor of veterinary medicine at purdue 
said it is possible the experiment could provide clues about human 
reproduction during generationslong voyages as well as the 
differences in cartilage bone tissue and internal organs between 
the space chicks and their earthbound contemporaries

the sheriffs department has agreed to comply 
with grand jury recommendations for ending abuse of jail inmates by 
a socalled rambo squad that allegedly stripped chained and 
beat inmates a spokesman said 
the grand jury investigated allegations by more than 100 people 
who said they had been abused or held naked in jail cells after 
being arrested for misdemeanor offenses which usually were 
alcoholrelated 
no indictments were issued but the panels report released 
last week following a ninemonth investigation criticized san 
diego county sheriff john duffy and his top assistants for failing 
to provide the leadership to stop a group of deputies at the el 
cajon jail from preying on inmates 
the grand jury found that the deputies found delight in 
cruelty to others 
the panel also cited coverups and mismanagement by jail 
supervisors and said many deputies looked the other way while 
inmates were being assaulted or harassed 
department spokesman lt alan fulmer said duffy has reviewed the 
20page report and there is absolutely nothing he disagrees 
with 
he thinks all the recommendations are good and he would like 
to implement them as soon as possible fulmer said 
the panels recommendations include the creation of an 
inspections and control division a strengthening of the 
departments internal affairs division required filing of detailed 
reports of physical confrontations between prisoners and deputies 
and tougher standards for the selection and performance of jail 
training officers

syrian and christian army gunners 
hammered each others positions in and around beirut today after 
random bombardment of the capital forced residents to spend the 
easter holiday underground 
police said three civilians were killed and 13 wounded in the 
hostilities overnight and during the morning the casualties raised 
the toll to 97 dead and 339 wounded since the latest round of 
fighting in lebanons 14yearold civil war broke out march 8 
the rocket and artillery barrages in the capital tapered off at 
daybreak but heavy duels resounded in the mountains overlooking 
beirut police said 
it was the fourth consecutive night that barrages on both 
christian east beirut and moslem west beirut have confined 
civilians to basements and bomb shelters 
the syrians and their allies have also ordered a blockade of 
east beirut and nearby christian communities home of about 1 
million people 
syrian forces and allied druse gunners pounded east beirut with 
rocket barrages of up to 60 rounds per minute during the night the 
bombardment set fires at a fuel tank at the beirut port and the 
citys main power plant police said the christian army units 
retaliated with barrages from 155mm howitzers 
until the damaged plant is repaired authorities will be able to 
provide electricity for just four hours a day 
the fighting pits army commander gen michel aouns 
predominantly christian units against an alliance of syrian troops 
and militiamen of druse warlord walid jumblatts progressive 
socialist party 
aoun contends the syrians who intervened 13 years ago as 
peacekeepers have turned into an occupation force by taking sides 
with moslems and druse he heads a christian military cabinet in 
lebanons divided government syrians back the rival moslem 
government 
the christian leader has declared a war of liberation to 
drive out the 40000 syrian troops he has vowed to fight on even 
at the risk of destroying beirut 
acting prime minister salim hoss who heads the moslem cabinet 
today rejected aouns accusations 
the syrian army entered lebanon in 1976 at the request of the 
then reigning lebanese government this request was later endorsed 
by the arab league of which lebanon is a founding member hoss 
said 
he said any demand for a syrian pullout should be made by a 
united lebanese government which is not present at the moment 
the latest violence began after aoun imposed a blockade on 
militarun ports the militias skim taxes that would otherwise go 
to the government

political manuevering in israel over who is a 
jew has left a painful legacy among american jews who in a 
survey more often perceived unfairness to conservative and reform 
jews than to west bank arabs 
the american jewish committee study revealed support for israel 
was as strong as ever but it also showed that widespread 
discontent was sown when attempts were made to amend israels law 
of return to deny nonorthodox converts an automatic right to 
israeli citizenship 
the study also provided new evidence of a growing activism among 
american jews toward their spiritual homeland according to some 
observers 
a majority 54 percent of the survey said they had spoken 
critically of attempts to change the law 
a third said they would be less likely to make political or 
charitable contributions to israel if the law is changed to exclude 
converts from reform and conservative judaism branches to which 
more than 80 percent of american jews affiliated to a synagogue 
belong 
i think the effect is kind of a contingent or sleeper 
effect said queens college professor steven m cohen who 
conducted the survey for the committees institute on american 
jewishisraeli relations this precedent will allow american jews 
to forcefully and pointedly disagree on other issues involving 
israel 
the attempt to define jewishness provided an emotional vent 
to american jews already concerned about israels response to the 
palestinian uprising in the west bank and gaza according to 
gunther lawrence a media consultant to the rabbinical assembly and 
other jewish groups 
i think that this is a family squabble that is erupting above 
the surface lawrence said american jews and diaspora jews are 
no longer content with being checkbook jews only 
orthodox religious parties which do not recognize the validity 
of conversions performed by conservative and reform rabbis have 
long sought to change the law of return but the issue heated up 
last year when they emerged as power brokers because neither of the 
two major israeli parties labor and likud won a majority in 
elections both parties indicated a willingness to negotiate on the 
law of return issue in return for the help of the religious parties 
in forming a coalition government 
the committees poll conducted among 944 jews in january and 
february was not a random sample and provided no measure of its 
sampling error but cohen said participants were demographically 
representative of the americanjewish community the questions were 
mailed to jews on a list compiled by market facts a research 
company 
the findings indicated the issue struck hard and close to home 
twothirds said israel would be declaring conservative and 
reform judaism illegitimate if the law of return were changed to 
recognize only conversions performed by orthodox rabbis 
threequarters said they would be upset if the law were changed 
to recognize only orthodox conversion and more than half saying 
they would be very upset 
thirtyseven percent said they would be less likely to make 
contributions to the united jewish appeal and 31 percent said they 
would be less likely to contribute to proisrael political 
candidates if the law were changed 
cohen said he was shocked that respondents were more upset with 
the law of return issue than with the palestinian uprising on the 
west bank and gaza strip where more than 400 palestinians and 17 
israelis have died during the past 15 months 
for example 39 percent of the respondents said conservative and 
reform jews are treated unfairly in israel while slightly less 
than a third of the respondents said arabs on the west bank and 
gaza are treated unfairly 
while some orthodox leaders in israel have tried to downplay the 
political consequences of changing the law the survey confirmed it 
is a grassroots issue said one of the americanjewish leaders who 
urged israeli officials to retain the present law 
its natural and understandable they should react with great 
fury said rabbi eric yoffie executive director of the 
association of reform zionists of america they sense the jewish 
state is proclaiming their judaism to be illegitimate 
the issue has faded into the background recently as labor and 
likud were able to form a coalition government but americanjewish 
leaders are already preparing to fight the battle again 
ira silverman executive vice president of the jewish committee 
said american jews are at this stage regrouping and have 
shared the survey results with israeli officials

on march 27 1964 an earthquake of 
recordbreaking proportions seized southcentral alaska and set off 
sea waves that punished faroff pacific ports ward sims now 
retired as ap bureau chief for alaska covered the disaster 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
the earthquake that shuddered across 
alaska on that good friday packed so strong a punch that it knocked 
out a seismograph in fairbanks it took a seismologist at a small 
college in mobile ala to warn the world of what was to come 
it could cause great devastation louis eisele predicted 
you can expect tidal waves from this one 
the earthquake had been felt by eiseles spring hill college 
seismograph it said the temblor was centered about 3600 miles 
northwest of mobile in the gulf of alaska or near kodiak island 
at 85 on the richter scale the 1964 earthquake was one of the 
strongest on record 
in the words of the us geological survey the entire earth 
vibrated like a tuning fork 
the quake started at 536 pm alaska standard time on march 27 
centered under a glaciated peninsula 75 miles east of anchorage it 
altered 100000 square miles of landscape 
along a 600mile arc from cape yakataga on the eastern gulf of 
alaska to the trinity islands southwest of kodiak the land to the 
north subsided by as much as six feet to the south it rose by as 
much as 50 feet 
land shifted horizontally as much as 70 feet in several places 
south of seward tangling railroad tracks splitting roads yanking 
down buildings 
property damage exceeded 311 million 
the earthquake and the seismic sea waves it spawned killed 114 
people in alaska more than a dozen others died at depoe bay ore 
and crescent city calif when seismic waves crashed ashore at 
those communities 
in the aftermath came the stories of the lucky and the luckless 
often merest circumstance determined who died and who survived 
in anchorage william tobin had just parked his car outside the 
new jc penney building when he felt a jolt he stepped from his 
car ready to have words with another driver 
i thought some stupid jerk had rammed me from behind says 
tobin managing editor of the anchorage times 
as he got out a huge slab of the building crashed down 
flattening his car 
nine people in anchorage werent so lucky 
in valdez many residents had turned out as usual to watch the 
freighter chena disgorge its cargo the arrival of the 400foot 
ship always was something special for valdez folks and on this day 
typically a crowd was on hand as longshoremen unloaded the 
vessel 
in an eternity that lasted only moments valdez was shaken 
unmercifully and the chena began wallowing insanely snapping her 
mooring lines the dock heaved rocked shook and then pitched into 
the water carrying onlookers and warehouses 
the chena survived the valdez waterfront and most of the 
business district were obliterated by collapsing ground and seismic 
waves 
thirtyone people died 
in kodiak norman holm and his son were fishing for herring from 
a skiff in the harbor holm could not understand why he suddenly 
lost control of the small boat 
i just couldnt make it respond it kept bouncing bouncing 
he says 
when the movement subsided holm headed to the dock he and his 
son oliver helped secure several fishing boats which had broken 
loose he checked the lines of his own 72foot neptune 
the level of water in the harbor started fluctuating wildly and 
then holm heard the terrible roar of water coming up the channel 
the frightening noise of docks and buildings collapsing 
the holms sprinted for shore as the dock creaked and groaned 
under the pressure of the rising water at the head of the dock 
holm fought the impulse to seek safety atop an eightfoot wooden 
tank used to keep crabs alive he and his son raced about 150 yards 
farther to the base of pillar mountain the hill which forms 
kodiaks backdrop 
with the sound of bedlam in the harbor behind them they clawed 
their way up the steep slope to an elevation of about 150 feet 
holm was too exhausted to go farther he told his son to go on but 
the boy stayed with his father 
the two watched in awe as huge waves battered kodiak for six 
hours the city lost most of its seafood processing industry 75 
percent of its business district and half its fishing fleet 
including the good ship neptune the wooden crab tank vanished 
nineteen people died 
in chenega avis anderson was preparing to take a bath when the 
tiny prince william sound village began shaking she scooped up her 
two sons and dashed up a forest trail to the safety of a high 
knoll 
behind her she could hear the sound of waves estimated up to 80 
feet tall smashing the village only 70 miles from the quakes 
epicenter of the 20 buildings in the town only the school was 
spared 
twentythree people died including andersons daughter 
parents a grandmother an uncle and an aunt 
i had horrible horrible nightmares for almost 20 years she 
says always they were the same i would be climbing up and up 
and the waves would be creeping higher and higher

more than 300 antiabortion protesters 
remained in jail this morning where their leader claimed police 
used excessive force in making arrests and accused the media of a 
prodeath bias 
the operation rescue protesters spent easter behind bars 
sometimes singing hymns refusing to take the legal steps that 
would have allowed them to leave jail because they wanted to 
dramatize their cause 
the groups jailed leader randall terry spent part of the day 
calling journalists to complain that they failed to show pictures 
of aborted fetuses that might show the public what abortion really 
entails 
he opened the new yorkbased groups holy week protests thursday 
by appearing at a news conference with a small white coffin that 
contained what he said was an aborted 19weekold fetus after 
opening the coffin lid he left challenging the media to televise 
the remains 
the media is the greatest perpetrator of this holocaust 
because theyre hiding the truth from the public terry said 
sunday its not a matter of taste the majority of the media 
elite are prodeath and reduce this to a war of words and its a 
war of bodies dead bodies 
the protesters are the latest of more than 21000 to be arrested 
nationally since 1987 mostly for blocking clinics where abortions 
are performed 
as part of their effort to focus attention on the supreme 
courts reconsideration of its 1973 decision legalizing abortion 
252 men and at least 50 women stayed in jail sunday by refusing to 
provide their names to police or to sign misdemeanor trespassing 
citations 
terry a former car salesman and three others could face more 
serious charges they remained jailed today for investigation of 
felony conspiracy to encourage others to commit a crime 
this felony charge is a joke he said how can you have a 
felony conspiracy to commit a misdemeanor trespass thats 
ludicrous 
he alleged los angeles police used excessive force when they 
arrested 750 protesters during a sixhour standoff outside a clinic 
saturday more than 1000 antiabortion activists were arrested 
during three days of protests in cypress long beach and los 
angeles 
officers treatment of protesters he charged was completely 
uncalled for and unprofessional you dont twist peoples arms to 
the point were theyre screaming in pain and sticking two fingers 
up their nose 
one demonstrators arm and wrist were broken in a scuffle with 
police saturday operation rescue said los angeles police cmdr 
william booth said sunday that the group was exaggerating the 
incidents 
police chief daryl gates said officers used a pain compliance 
hold in the arrests and he said he would ask the city attorney 
to sue operation rescue for the 60000 to 100000 the 
demonstration cost the city

the cash surplus at the federal reserve bank 
here has jumped from 165 million in 1985 to 38 billion in 1988 
and authorities believe the 23fold increase is largely because of 
laundered drug money moving through banks 
it is a good indicator that we are awash with dope money being 
laundered through los angeles not just from the los angeles area 
but from elsewhere in the country us attorney robert bonner 
said 
staggering amounts of cash are being funneled into the los 
angeles area for laundering here 
despite hefty fines levied against some of the states largest 
financial institutions drug officials say the illegal money is 
being funneled into the federal reserve after being laundered 
through banks 
laundering is the process of passing money through enough 
transactions that it is hard to trace it may arrive at a bank as a 
legitimate business deposit the money may then be transferred to 
foreign bank accounts controlled by drug kingpins without 
traffickers having to smuggle cash out of the country 
miami which had a reputation of being the hub for drug 
laundering saw its federal reserve surplus drop from a high of 6 
billion in 1985 to 48 billion in 1988 still the largest surplus 
in the country 
us drug enforcement administration spokesman ralph lochridge 
said the trend validates los angeles as the new moneylaundering 
and drug financial center in the united states 
the federal reserve system is the nations central bank 
managing the money supply by controlling how much cash member banks 
must keep liquid instead of loaning out about 40 percent of the 
nations banks belong to the federal reserve system 
when deposits at a federal reserve district branch exceed the 
branchs cash shipments back to its member banks that district is 
said to have a cash surplus 
only 10 of the 35 branches of the federal reserve reported cash 
surpluses last year after miami and los angeles the others are 
jacksonville fla with a 19 billion surplus san antonio 511 
million el paso texas 484 million nashville tenn 399 
million denver 367 million new orleans 118 million helena

diplomatic sources told the associated press the boat had four 
british male crew and technicians and two prominent arabs the 
sources who spoke on condition of anonymity would not elaborate 
on their identity 
tehran made no public comment on the reports which surfaced 
sunday in a report by the kuwaiti newspaper alanbaa

the supreme court today agreed to decide 
whether states may impose labelng and reporting requirements on 
liquor sold at us military bases within their borders 
the court said it will review a ruling that such north dakota 
regulation of liquor sold at two military bases in that state 
violates federal policy 
a north dakota law requires all liquor sold in the state to be 
distributed through a statecontrolled system 
state officials sought to require outofstate liquor 
distributors to put a label on each bottle sold at the grand forks 
and minot air force bases the labels were to say the liquor is for 
consumption only at the military installations 
the state also wanted suppliers to report monthly on how much 
liquor they shipped into the state 
the rules were designed to prevent liquor intended for the two 
military enclaves from being sold elsewhere in north dakota 
the federal government challenged the regulations arguing they 
violated a federal policy aimed at assuring liquor sold at clubs 
and stores on military bases would be purchased by the government 
for the lowest possible price profits from the military base sales 
are used to pay for recreational activities 
federal officials said it could cost the government 200000 to 
250000 more each year if the labeling and reporting regulations 
were enforced in north dakota they said the rules would force them 
to purchase more liquor from north dakota distributors at higher 
prices 
the 8th us circuit court of appeals ruled last september that 
the state regulations must give way to the federal policy 
the appeals court rejected the states argument that it was 
empowered to impose the regulations by the 21st amendment to the 
constitution which repealed prohibition and gave states sweeping 
control over liquor distribution 
we conclude that the 21st amendment provides no basis for 
regulating the means by which congress has sought to order military 
liquor procurement and to provide for the welfare and morale 
activities of military personnel the appeals court said 
the national beer wholesalers association supported north 
dakotas appeal the association said there is uncontradicted 
evidence that north dakota was seriously concerned about the 
problem of diversion of liquor from military reservations 
the case is north dakota vs us 88926

chinas foreign minister said today some us 
officials were illinformed about human rights questions in china 
and threatened progress toward close bilateral relations 
on sinosoviet relations meanwhile qian qichen told reporters 
that even after soviet leader mikhail gorbachev visits china in 
may there will be some way to go before differences between the 
two countries are resolved 
since diplomatic ties were formed a decade ago relations 
between the united states and china enjoy vast potential and the 
prospects are very good qian said 
but he warned against interference in chinese internal matters 
that he said was not in the interest of friendly relations 
qian called for a new pattern of relations based on mutual 
trust and had sharp words for members of the us congress who 
have criticized chinas lack of democratic reform and its human 
rights record in tibet 
a small number of people in the american congress are actually 
very illinformed about the situation in tibet they have very 
strong prejudice 
the chinese government last week criticized both the european 
parliament and the us congress for statements over the 
declaration of martial law in the tibetan capital of lhasa 
following proindependence riots there this month 
human rights qian said are a matter of basic questions such as 
providing adequate food and education and are inseparable with 
the actual condition of the country involved 
he also said us congressional criticisms of chinas family 
planning policies that try to keep couples from having more than 
one child were fairly absurd 
the united states in recent years has withheld funds for un 
family planning programs on the grounds that money going to china 
backs up strict birth control policies that have led to forced 
abortions 
qian said china which supports the antivietnamese resistance 
in cambodia backs the dispatch of a un peacekeeping force after 
vietnam ends its 10year occupation but he said china is not 
preparing to send peace troops to cambodia 
the question of cambodia will be high on the agenda when 
gorbachev meets chinese leaders in beijing qian said 
the summit the first between the two countries in 30 years 
will normalize longstrained relations qian said but doesnt mean 
that all major obstacles to better relations will be removed 
soviet support for vietnams invasion of cambodia is regarded by 
china as the most serious obstacle to better ties between beijing 
and moscow

the supreme court today let stand a 300000 
award won by oregons former chief medical examiner from the woman 
who fired him following news reports that he had sold body parts to 
finance parties in the morgue 
the justices without comment refused to hear arguments by 
kristine gebbie administrator of the state health division aimed 
at overturning the award won by william j brady 
a federal jury ruled that gebbie deprived brady of his 
constitutionally protected liberty interests without due process of 
law when she fired him in 1985 
brady had maintained a bank account in his name but with the 
knowledge of everyone in his office for money paid for pituitary 
glands and other body parts removed during autopsies in the state 
coroners office 
the money was used for various amenities in the medical 
examiners office 
when gebbie announced bradys firing on oct 3 1985 she issued 
a press release in which she said brady had knowingly violated 
public trust and confidence through his systematic 16year 
diversion of public funds 
in upholding the jury verdict last oct 31 the 9th us circuit 
court of appeals said brady presented undisputed evidence that 
gebbie charged him with 
violating the public trust 
diverting state funds for his own use 
establishing a slush fund 
causing the state to be billed for toxicological reports made 
in connection with private autopsies he performed 
the appeals court added there was sufficient evidence 
presented from which a jury could reasonably infer that the charges 
were both contested and false 
in the appeal acted on today oregon solicitor general virginia 
linder argued for gebbie that the appeals court ruling places 
government employers in an untenable position 
the appeal said the 9th circuit courts ruling gives no clear 
guidelines for governments responsiveness to the performance of 
its highlevel officials and its ability to speak to the public it 
serves 
the appeal also contended that gebbie was entitled to qualified 
immunity from bradys lawsuit because she acted in unquestioned 
good faith and the law concerning liberty interests and 
nameclearing hearings is far from settled 
the case is gebbie vs brady 881299

the supreme court today refused to review a 
pennsylvania judges lawsuit against two newspapers that reported 
on what was to have been a confidential state investigation of him 
the court without comment let stand rulings that dismissed 
state supreme court justice rolf larsens suit against the 
philadelphia inquirer and the pittsburgh postgazette 
as a result of various articles appearing in both newspapers 
about larsen the states judicial inquiry and review board began 
an investigation in mid1982 
in his suit larsen said the articles portrayed him as being 
involved in political activity racism favoritism and 
influencepeddling 
completed in may 1983 the state boards investigation 
exonerated larsen of any wrongdoing 
during the investigation both newspapers published reports 
about the boards supposedly secret proceedings some articles even 
contained excerpts of hearing transcripts 
those reports were the basis of larsens suit in which he 
charged the newspapers with obtaining the transcripts illegally and 
publishing only selected excerpts that placed him in a false light 
the suit which sought monetary damages also claimed that the 
articles invaded larsens privacy and violated the confidentiality 
provisions of state law 
a state trial judge dismissed most of the lawsuits counts and 
that dismissal was upheld by a state appeals court 
the appeals court relied heavily on a 1978 ruling by the 
nations highest court in a virginia case 
in that decision the justices said the freepress protections 
in the constitutions first amendment mean newspapers cannot be 
criminally punished for publishing truthful information about 
secret governmental proceedings 
the decision struck down a virginia law that made it a crime to 
report about a state judicial commissions confidential 
investigations into judges fitness to hold office 
the pennsylvania appeals court ruled that allowing larsens 
civil suit would like virginias criminal law violate freepress 
rights 
the imposition of monetary damages civil sanctions can be 
just as inimical to and an encroachment of ones first amendment 
guarantees as criminal sanctions the state court said 
the pennsylvania supreme court refused to hear larsens ensuing 
appeal last oct 31 
in the appeal acted on today lawyers for larsen argued that the 
state courts wrongly concluded that the newspapers freepress 
rights would be harmed if larsen were allowed to sue over 
violations of state confidentiality provisions 
lawyers for the newspapers urged the justices to reject the 
appeal they noted among other things that the state court 
rulings left larsen free to amend his complaint to explain his 
assertion that confidential information was obtained illegally 
the case is larsen vs philadelphia newspapers 881274

maverick populist boris n yeltsin savored his 
political comeback today as election officials announced he had 
trounced a communist party loyalist for moscows sole atlarge seat 
in the new national legislature 
its hard to say what my spirit is more full of joy or 
concern about what i realistically can do to help muscovites the 
58yearold yeltsin told several hundred applauding workers at the 
state construction committee where he is first deputy chairman 
igor n orlov chairman of moscows election commission said 
yeltsin won 894 percent of the vote sunday his opponent yevgeny 
brakov received 69 percent of the vote 
yeltsin who was ousted as moscow communist party boss in 1987 
has accused the partys elite of trying to discredit him and had 
said he feared votes might be tampered with to cheat him out of 
victory 
the former protege of president mikhail s gorbachev campaigned 
against the privileges afforded highranking soviet officials and 
called for faster reforms to improve living standards for everyone 
his opponent brakov the 51yearold director of the zil 
limousine plant has carefully followed the party line in most 
matters the cars made at his factory are a prized perquisite of 
highranking officials 
brakov had said his top priority is to end food shortages by 
providing more machinery to farmers and improving storage and 
processing facilities 
large proyeltsin rallies were held in the capital in the 
closing days of the campaign and the former moscow party leader 
became something of a symbol for people expressing a desire for 
truly representative government 
ocal moscow election officials spent all night counting votes 
after sundays election for the new congress of peoples deputies 
the countrys first contested elections in more than 70 years 
we have been sitting and waiting since last evening for the 
final votes we are unshaven and have had no sleep viktor 
kubivsky a member of moscows volgograd district said by 
telephone 
andrei rudyakov a city council member said the votes 
initially counted at local election districts were being recounted 
at the city election headquarters and the information was fed into 
computers for final tabulation 
he said representatives of yeltsin and brakov were at the 
council building to oversee the recount 
of more than 2000 soviets interviewed by western correspondents 
at polling places after the voting 1734 were for yeltsin and 162 
for brakov others either refused to disclose how they voted or 
expressed opposition to either candidate 
after casting his ballot yeltsin claimed many soviets were 
worried about voting fraud and he complained that the elections 
were not completely democratic 
people are worried about the election results worried that 
there will be deviations at election stations during vote 
counting he told reporters everything is troubling them 
he said the campaign was not fully democratic but was a 
big step forward from previous onecandidate balloting he said 
the real test of democracy will be whether the vote count is fair 
gorbachev who brought yeltsin into communist party leadership 
in 1985 and two years later oversaw his ouster on charges of making 
political mistakes and displaying personal ambition said criticism 
of party officials is normal during campaigns

the government today released a report 
that accused an aide to prime minister rajiv gandhi of links to the 
assassination of his mother officials said investigators later 
found the aide was not involved 
the findings of a special commission report on prime minister 
indira gandhis 1984 slaying were withheld for three years but a 
newspaper account of the report prompted opposition legislators to 
demand its release 
when rajiv gandhi initially refused opposition legislators 
walked out of parliament and some were suspended for a week for 
misbehavior 
the commission report released to parliament accused rajendra 
kumar dhawan mrs gandhis personal secretary of facilitating the 
assassination but it added the possiblity of someone else being 
involved along with mr dhawan cannot be excluded 
a government memorandum also released today said investigators 
had checked the accusations and found dhawan had no hand in the 
conspiracy for the assassination of mrs gandhi and that there was 
nothing to indicate that mr dhawan was in any way involved in the 
crime or conspiracy 
dhawan 52 left his post shortly after mrs gandhis death but 
returned to government last month as a key adviser to rajiv gandhi 
he was not immediately available for comment 
mrs gandhi was shot in the garden of her new delhi residence by 
two sikh bodyguards as she walked to a television interview 
one of the sikhs beant singh was shot and killed by other 
bodyguards minutes after the assassination and the other satwant 
singh was convicted of murder and hanged on jan 6 a third sikh 
kehar singh was convicted of conspiracy and also hanged 
in releasing the report to parliament home minister buta singh 
said another special investigating team also had unraveled a 
conspiracy he said additional charges would be filed but did 
not say when or against whom 
according to the report the commission did not rule out 
involvement of an unspecified foreign agency that might have used 
the assassins as unwitting instruments 
india has long accused neighboring pakistan of training and 
arming sikh militants pakistan has denied the charge 
parliament passed a resolution in 1986 allowing the government 
to withhold the report in the interest of national security but on 
march 14 the indian express newspaper published parts of the 
report that alleged dhawan lied during questioning and gave 
unconvincing explanations about entries in his diary including the 
name of one of mrs gandhis assassins 
gandhi released the report only after members of his congress 
party threatened to do so 
the government says mrs gandhi was killed in revenge for an 
army raid she ordered on the golden temple in amritsar the holiest 
sikh shrine 
at least 1200 people many of them sikhs were killed in the 
june 1984 raid which was aimed at ousting sikh extremists who had 
turned the shrine into an armed fortress 
sikh militants began fighting in 1982 for an independent 
homeland 
sikhs who comprise 2 percent of indias 880 million people 
claim discrimination by the hindus who make up 80 percent of the 
population

irans main rebel opposition group said 
today that the sister of its leader massoud rajavi has been 
executed after being tortured in an iranian prison 
tehran had no immediate comment on the allegation 
in a statement sent to the associated press in nicosia the 
mujahedeen khalq or the peoples warriors said monireh rajavi was 
arrested with her husband asghar nazemi in 1982 
the statement said the couples only offense was that the woman 
was the sister of rajavi who in addition to being the mujahadeen 
khalqs leader also is commander of the national liberation army 
a coalition of iranian dissident factions based in iraq 
it said nazemi was executed in 1985 and his wife was tortured 
for several years before being executed she was 38 years old the 
statement said 
the rebels did not identify the prison where she was held or 
give the date and method of the alleged execution iranians usually 
execute women by firing squads men are usually hanged 
the mujahedeen khalq statement said the couple has two daughters 
but it did not say where they live or how old they are 
the londonbased human rights group amnesty international as 
well as other human rights organizations and some governments have 
condemned iran for executing thousands of political prisoners since 
august in that month authorities began a crackdown against 
dissidents after a ceasefire halted eight years of war with iraq 
the tehran government has said most people executed recently 
were drug traffickers

the supreme court said today it will restudy 
how far states may go in limiting a jurys discretion to choose 
life or death for convicted murderers 
the court agreed to decide whether pennsylvanias death penalty 
law violates the constitution by improperly limiting jury 
discretion 
it will hear an appeal by scott wayne blystone sentenced to die 
for a sept 9 1983 murder committed during a robbery 
blystone and three others picked up hitchhiker dalton charles 
smithburger jr in fayette county the jury found that blystone 
robbed the man of 13 and then fatally shot him in the back of the 
head 
the same jury sentencted blystone to death 
pennsylvanias death penalty statute says the verdict must be 
a sentence of death if the jury unanimously finds at least one 
aggravating circumstance and no mitigating circumstance 
the only aggravating factor the jury found was that blystone 
killed smithburger during a felony namely robbery 
blystone did not submit any mitigating factors during the 
sentencing phase of the case 
the pennsylvania supreme court ruled last october that the state 
law does not violate the us supreme courts prohibition against 
the mandatory death penalty 
the state court said under the pennsylvania law an individual 
may thwart the imposition of the death penalty by offering evidence 
of mitigating circumstances concerning his character record and 
the circumstances of the offense since blystone refused to 
present any evidence of mitigation there was nothing to block 
imposition of the death penalty 
the supreme court in 1978 said juries may not be precluded from 
considering mitigating evidence 
lawyers for blystone said the pennsylvania law works like a 
mandatory capital punishment act because the jury is misled into 
believing it has a moral duty to impose the death penalty in such 
cases 
pennsylvania law enforcement officials argued that the state 
death penalty statute is constitutional because despite its 
mandatory language nothing prevents the defendant from presenting 
mitigating evidence to offset the presentation of aggravating 
circumstances 
the case is blystone vs pennsylvania 886222

voters gave populist reformer boris n yeltsin a 
resounding victory in his campaign against toplevel privilege and 
economic failures that have emptied soviet store shelves according 
to election results announced today 
yeltsin won 894 percent of the vote in his race to represent 
the city he once ran as communist party chief said igor n orlov 
chairman of moscows election commission 
yeltsins opponent in sundays balloting for a new national 
legislature the more traditional party loyalist yevgeny brakov 
received 69 percent of the vote orlov told reporters 
the 58yearold yeltsin had become the most visible symbol of 
opposition to the party establishment in sundays elections the 
first time soviet voters had a choice of candidates in seven 
decades 
yeltsins race for the sole atlarge moscow seat typified the 
more democratic politics that president mikhail s gorbachev has 
brought to the soviet union 
boris yeltsin was named a peoples deputy of the ussr 
from moscows city national territorial district no 1 the 
official tass news agency said 
hundreds of workers applauded yeltsin today when he spoke the 
state construction committee where he is first deputy chairman 
its hard to say what my spirit is more full of joy or 
concern about what i realistically can do to help muscovites 
yeltsin said 
yeltsin pledged to quit his job in the construction committee 
and be a fulltime legislator in the new 2250seat congress of 
peoples deputies voters elected 1500 deputies sunday and the 
rest are being chosen separately by members of 
officiallysanctioned organizations 
yeltsin was fired as moscow party boss in november 1987 after 
criticizing the partys style of leadership and warning that a 
stalinlike cult of personality could form around gorbachev he 
lost his position as a candidate member of the ruling politburo and 
was transferred to the state construction committee 
he campaigned against the special supplies of food and consumer 
goods cars and drivers and other services that moscow government 
and party officials receive and criticized what he said were 
economic reform efforts that did not go far enough 
in other races in moscow reformeconomist oleg t bogomolov and 
ilya i zaslavsky an activist for the handicapped won seats to 
the congress roy a medvedev a historian whose work went against 
the official grain before gorbachev will face a runoff election 
the new congress will meet once a year to choose the countrys 
president and elect about 400 of its own members to a new fulltime 
legislature the supreme soviet 
yeltsins campaign drew thousands of enthusiastic supporters who 
held marches and demonstrations in the weeks just prior to the 
election 
asked if he had received congratulations from gorbachev yeltsin 
said thats unlikely but i would be very happy and thank him 
from the bottom of my heart 
he reiterated that he does not see himself as a political 
opponent of the soviet leader 
in 74 percent of sundays races voters had a choice between two 
or more candidates the central election commission said however 
82 percent of the candidates were communist party members the 
weekly moscow news reported guaranteeing the communists will 
dominate the new assembly 
still this was the first time since the soviet unions earliest 
days that the people were afforded a choice 
the central election commission said about 190 million of the 
soviet unions 285 million people were eligible to vote tass said 
more than 80 percent of moscows 67 million eligible voters took 
part in the election 
the kremlin faced strong challenges from independent candidates 
in republics like lithuania where nationalist sentiments are strong 
in the baltic republic the grassroots sajudis or lithuanian 
restructuring movement said unofficial returns showed its 
candidates finished strongly against those endorsed by the 
communist party 
sajudis officials claimed their 39 candidates in lithuanias 42 
electoral districts either finished first or forced runoff 
elections in districts where no candidate gained a majority 
gorbachev who came to power in 1985 is assured of a seat in 
the new congress and the elections are unlikely to produce any 
major upheaval in the power structure 
the soviet president who with his wife raisa voted at moscows 
institute of chemical physics told reporters sunday the 
occasionally boisterous campaign caused by the contested elections 
was just what the kremlin leadership wanted 
the electoral law that we passed has justified our hopes 
gorbachev said it has advanced the political thought and social 
activity of the people and this is what we wanted to achieve 
elections in the soviet union were until sunday carefully 
choreographed rituals in which practically all eligible voters were 
said to turn out and those running got 999 percent of the vote 
some soviets expressed satisfaction at finally having a choice but 
there were also objections 
i think the quality of our leaders will improve because now we 
have a real democracy said dr valentina agababova as she sat on 
a windowsill at voting precinct no 5 in moscows sverdlovsk 
district crossing out names of candidates she opposed 
but in moscows gagarin district where 12 candidates were 
running some old people have gotten upset about having so many 
choices said elections secretary natalya safonkina 
the last elections in which most russians had a choice occurred 
weeks after the november 1917 revolution that swept lenin and the 
bolsheviks to power the communists had since allowed just one 
approved candidate to run for each seat

the supreme court today let stand a ruling 
that a public hospital does not violate the constitutionally 
required separation of church and state by having a chaplain on its 
payroll 
the court without comment refused to hear an appeal by three 
iowa atheists who said taxpayers should not be forced to fund a 
chaplains salary at a countyrun hospital 
the 8th us circuit court of appeals last september upheld the 
employment of a chaplain at polk countys broadlawns medical center 
in des moines 
three avowed atheists larry henry carter his daughter 
courtney and maurice labelle said their rights were violated 
because the government was sponsoring religious activity 
the supreme court ruled in 1983 that paying chaplains to lead 
daily prayers in congress and state legislatures does not violate 
the constitution the court cited a long tradition 200 years old 
in the case of congress to support its ruling 
the iowa atheists noted that the chaplain at broadlawns maggie 
alzeno rogers was hired in 1985 and her duties are more than 
ceremonial 
a deacon of the united church of christ ms rogers counsels 
patients their families and hospital workers and conducts 
religious services and bible study classes at the hospital she is 
paid 23000 a year 
the 8th circuit court said her duties serve a secular purpose 
enhancing the hospitals wholistic treatment approach 
the purpose of the chaplaincy was the same as that of the 
hospital generally to help patients get well or at least to 
provide the best care possible for those who would not get well 
the appeals court said 
it added that there was evidence ms rogers presence did not 
advance religion unconstitutionally because she refrained from 
proselytizing seeking religious converts 
the appeals court also said ms rogers may have reduced 
entanglement between the church and state at the hospital because 
there is less need for hospital officials to supervise volunteer 
chaplains who worked at broadlawns before she was hired 
it is part of ms rogers job to make sure that the volunteer 
chaplains are not proselytizing the appeals court said 
it also noted that many patients at the hospital are committed 
involuntarily or are prisoners treated there comparing ms rogers 
to a military chaplain the appeals court said many patients would 
have no alternative religious counseling if she were not available 
the appeals court said however that ms rogers should be 
permitted to give only secular counseling to hospital employees 
in other action the court 
said it will restudy how far states may go in limiting a 
jurys discretion to choose life or death for convicted murderers 
the court agreed to decide whether pennsylvanias death penalty 
law violates the constitution by improperly limiting jury 
discretion 
pennsylvanias death penalty statute says the verdict must be 
a sentence of death if the jury unanimously finds at least one 
aggravating circumstance and no mitigating circumstance 
refused to review a pennsylvania judges lawsuit against two 
newspapers that reported on what was to have been a confidential 
state investigation of him 
the court without comment let stand rulings that dismissed 
state supreme court justice rolf larsens suit against the 
philadelphia inquirer and the pittsburgh postgazette 
agreed to decide whether states may impose labeling and

the rev eugene profeta the preacher 
jessica hahn said she turned to for solace after her sexual 
encounter with deposed ptl leader jim bakker was sentenced today 
to six months in jail for witness tampering and tax charges 
hahn had helped put together the case against profeta after 
being promised immunity from prosecution 
under a pleabargain agreement the long island minister also 
got five years probation and was also ordered to pay about 26000 
in back taxes interest and fines he will be required to stay away 
from hahn his former church secretary 
profeta 52 was sentenced this morning by state supreme court 
justice joseph harris who denied a request from profetas lawyer 
stephen scaring that the minister be sentenced to community 
service instead of a jail term 
in january just before his trial was to begin profeta entered 
a surprise guilty plea to two of 18 charges against him he 
admitted he tried to get hahn to lie to the grand jury about his 
financial dealings and filed a false 1986 income tax return 
hahn profetas onetime secretary has said she and he became 
lovers after her sexual encounter with bakker in 1980 because she 
was emotionally upset about the experience 
two years ago revelations about the encounter and the money 
paid to hahn afterward to keep quiet about it toppled bakker from 
his ptl ministry 
under his plea bargain agreement with state attorney general 
robert abrams charges that profeta had skimmed church funds were 
dropped also tax evasion charges against his wife glenda were 
dismissed 
about 150 people from profetas congregation made the trip from 
long island to albany to show support for the minister some sat in 
the hallway outside the courtroom crying while others shouted 
praise the lord 
he preached to his long island ministry on easter sunday after

those of the missing earl i would treat that with a great deal 
of skepticism a police officer said speaking on condition of 
anonymity

not know the age and sex of the person the cause of death or how 
long ago it occurred

a longtime diabetic whose pancreas had 
virtually destroyed his heart has been given another chance to live 
after doctors transplanted both organs in what is believed to be 
the first such operation ever 
barry katz 45 was listed in serious condition today at the 
washington hospital center and a spokeswoman said he was given an 
80 percent chance of surviving a year 
but before the surgery saturday the silver spring md 
physicists chances of living even a week were slim 
he was slipping away his wife kay said when you see a 
loved on slipping away you grab at anything that can help him 
i knew this was it this was his last chance 
katzs body has shown no signs of rejecting the organs doctors 
said and if all continues to go well he could leave the hospital 
within weeks and eventually return to work as a senior scientist 
for the pentagons strategic defense initiative program they said 
katz had undergone heart bypass surgery seven years ago but the 
organ had begun deteriorating again over the past several months 
he was hospitalized a week before a local donor was found 
this is very fast said lori e brigham of the washington 
regional transplant consortium he was very very fortunate in 
terms of timing doctors refused to identify the donor 
katzs doctors decided to transplant his pancreas as well as his 
heart because they believed his severe diabetes would make 
management of a new heart difficult or impossible 
although the hospital does not have permission from the district 
of columbias state health planning and development agency to 
transplant the pancreas surgeons went ahead with the double 
transplant anyway fearing katz would die if they waited 
to our knowledge its the first heartpancreas transplant 
ever done said hospital spokeswoman sarah dodge 
dr hans w sollinger a wisconsin surgeon considered one of the 
leading experts in pancreas transplants was flown in by private 
jet saturday morning the procedure which was divided into 
separate operations for each transplant lasted the entire day 
everything proceeded wonderfully said dr jimmy a light a 
member of the surgical team the pancreas is working and we 
think his diabetes is cured 
the pancreas is supposed to produce insulin the hormone that 
regulates the bodys metabolism of sugar when the organ doesnt 
function properly patients develop diabetes and often have to 
rely on insulin injections and constant monitering to survive 
diabetes can destroy the vascular system said ms dodge 
severe heart disease is a complication of diabetes the 
oneyear survival rate for patients receiving a new pancreas has 
been about 50 percent compared with 85 percent for other organs 
light said 
but improvements in management of antirejection drugs for the 
pancreas should improve katzs outlook making his chances of 
surviving one year about 80 percent doctors said

guatemalan militiamen brandished machine 
guns and ordered hugh iltis out of his jeep iltis determined to 
protect his precious hoard brandished right back 
i showed anger arrogance if you like the 63yearold 
scientist recalled i flashed out my documents they backed off 
they let me go on 
this indiana jonesstyle encounter involved neither gold nor 
gems but rather a humble looking weedy plant 
iltis an intense burly czechborn botanist at the university 
of wisconsin is one of the worlds foremost collectors of rare 
plant species the precious cargo he was protecting from the 
guatemalans several years ago was a genetic cousin of corn called 
teosinte because its genes may carry resistance to certain 
viruses this scraggly plant may someday prove more valuable to 
mankind than gold 
as such plantrich parts of the globe as the amazon jungle are 
stripped and despoiled scientists and governments are racing time 
to gather rare plant species and preserve them before they are lost 
forever 
iltis has braved harsh climates and tropical sickness and says 
he has occasionally given gifts at customs posts to ensure the 
safe passage of himself and his botanical booty across borders and 
he said plant hunters sometimes face tough practical and ethical 
choices 
increasingly third world nations see the germplasm issue as 
just another instance of the united states stealing their 
resources the last thing american botanists want to be accused of 
is plundering such nations 
iltis said that in mexico brazil and other countries that have 
placed impossibly difficult and timeconsuming restrictions on 
plant exploration us scientists look for quiet ways around the 
regulations 
youre supposed to collect with the permission of mexico 
said iltis i never have but i always share 
iltis says he makes up for his intrusions by religiously sending 
back duplicates of any samples to mexican scientists he has also 
sent valuable plant reference books to colleagues in nicaragua and 
other central american nations he has explored 
interviews with several plant hunters revealed that 
conservation rather than profit is most often their prime 
motivator some like iltis join the hunt for purely scientific 
reasons that have nothing to do with improving agriculture 
there is nothing in the world so thrilling to a taxonomist 
than to walk into an entirely new flora he told a recent visitor 
to his university herbarium where row after row of special movable 
file cabinets house hundreds of rare species of corn and other 
trophies of more than two decades of expeditions to mexico central 
america and the soviet union 
for anyone studying natural history life can never be long 
enough he said 
slowly governments including our own have begun sponsoring 
and financing plant expeditions because rare species may contain 
genetic information that plant breeders and geneticists can someday 
use to help protect crops from viruses drought or other 
lifethreatening blights or hazards 
yet despite the limitless potential of this genetic resource 
called germplasm and the high importance scientists attach to 
its preservation the department of agriculture has financed an 
average of only four expeditions a year since 1956 according to 
usda figures 
in the fiscal year 1989 a relatively flush year for germplasm 
exploration the government is still spending only 150000 to 
finance about a dozen missions 
nevertheless that is more than the mere 40000 spent by the 
government as recently as 1986 according to calvin sperling head 
of the usdas plant exploration office who has been on three 
expeditions to south america and the middle east and plans to go to 
turkey this spring to gather wild lentils chick peas and 
pistachios 
governmentsponsored trips tend to be less hazardous than those 
undertaken by private scientists said david spooner a usda 
botanist who spends 23 months a year on plant expeditions for the 
government mostly hunting potato species such trips usually 
involve sharing the fruits of the search with scientists from the 
host country 
but prior to his stint as a usda explorer spooner recalls he 
knew all too well the dangers of attempting the same thing on 
nothing more than a passport and plane ticket 
i traveled throughout latin america and i was hassled 
constantly he said in mexico police stopped him and asked for 
money he said in honduras police stopped him every 50 
kilometers and challenged him to produce credentials 
what do you do if authorities ask for bribes mused william 
alberson a university of wisconsin plant research associate who 
has explored for plants in colombia and other south american 
countries you pay it

this city on lake erie is moving closer to 
becoming the third area in the country with legalized casino 
gambling but residents still disagree whether a casino would be a 
blessing or a curse 
lorain an economically struggling and largely bluecollar city 
of 72000 people would have a referendum on the issue under the 
proposal the state house approved march 15 
it would make more work and brighten this little town up 
said herman ricks 50 a 27year employee at ford motor cos 
lorain assembly plant 
but linda hamilton 32 a mother of two said she may already 
start to fight against the proposal 
i think it would hurt lorain and it would hurt lorain 
families said mrs hamilton i think crime would definitely go 
up 
the proposal which has been pending for 14 months faces an 
uncertain future in the state senate where hearings start next 
month gov richard celeste wont say yet whether he would sign or 
veto the legislation 
house approval sparked a surge of opposition including comments 
from clevelands top two elected officials that a casino might 
attract organized crime a organization of roman catholic bishops 
in ohio opposes any change in state law that could lead to 
development of a casino 
the house bill would permit voterapproved casino gambling only 
in lorain as a fiveyear pilot project ohio law allows charity 
bingo horse racing and the staterun lottery but casino gambling 
is legal only in the state of nevada and in atlantic city nj 
the bishops said bingo games had enough potential for abuse that 
parishes were being encouraged to find other ways to raise money 
and that noncharitable gambling was even more dangerous 
the originator of the proposal is alan spitzer whose family 
operates more than 20 car dealerships in ohio and florida spitzer 
envisions building a 400 million resort that will include a 
1000room hotel restaurants shops and a casino on a former 
american shipbuilding co property his family owns on the black 
river which meets lake erie at lorain 29 miles west of cleveland 
the bills sponsor state rep joseph koziura believes voters 
would approve the casino proposal 
koziura a democrat from lorain bristles when he talks about 
opposition by cleveland mayor george voinovich a republican and 
cleveland city council president george forbes a democrat 
it could cause us some problems koziura said this is not 
a republican or a democratic bill this bill is simply an economic 
development tool that we feel we ought to have the right to vote 
on 
many believe the project would be an economic boom to lorain 
which has struggled in the 1980s because of the loss of about 5000 
jobs at the usx plant the elimination of approximately 2000 jobs 
at ford and the 1983 shutdown of american shipbuilding which at 
its peak employed 1500 
lorain had an unemployment rate of 104 percent in february 
while ohio had a statewide rate of 69 percent said mayor alex 
olejko one of the proposals strongest backers 
supporters believe the casinohotel complex would employ up to 
4000 people with increases in touristrelated employment 
providing a net gain of 10000 jobs 
others are concerned that a casino would increase crime and 
corruption 
police chief john malinovsky was indicted this month on felony 
charges of extortion and perjury for allegedly pressuring fire 
inspectors into ignoring fire code violations at a charity bingo 
hall his daughter planned to run 
one of his subordinates sgt wayne long is serving a twoyear 
prison term in connection with the same investigation 
safety director richard yepko resigned last week after police 
announced that he was being investigated for allegedly telling 
local clubs shortly after malinovskys arrest that illegal gambling 
would be overlooked yepko hasnt been charged 
i think all this negative publicity will hurt the chances of 
the casino said robert azzariti jr a high school business 
teacher who says he hasnt decided how he would vote 
lorain needs something and we need to develop the 
waterfront azzariti said but youd have to worry about the 
crime element youd have to worry about the kinds of people a 
casino draws in i worry about these things too about whats 
going to happen to the moral fiber of the community 
olejko said the legislation includes protections against 
organized crime the ohio attorney general automatically would be a 
member of a commission overseeing the casinos operation and 
voters would have an opportunity to decide whether to retain the 
casino after five years

the state house judiciary committee 
today formally sent to the full house articles of impeachment 
against treasurer a james manchin stemming from losses of 279 
million in a fund under manchins control in 1987 
the committee voted 177 to recommend the impeachment after 
adding two additional articles to the 16 it voted for last 
wednesday 
the popular flamboyant manchin 61 is in his second term as 
state treasurer he is a democrat and his party also controls the 
house of delegates and state senate 
house speaker chuck chambers said the body could vote on 
impeachment as early as wednesday if it passes the house the case 
would then go to the senate for a trial 
senate president larry tucker anticipating that a majority of 
the house will vote to impeach manchin has told his colleagues to 
be prepared to hear the case in may and estimated the trial would 
take three to four weeks 
the last time a west virginia treasurer was impeached and 
removed from office was in 1876 
also today the house judiciary committee then voted 223 to 
censure state auditor glen gainer for his role in the losses 
the articles recommend that manchin be impeached for 
maladministration incompetence neglect of duty and high crimes 
and misdemeanors for his role in the investment fund losses and for 
conspiring to cover them up 
the two articles added today accuse him of putting an 
unqualified person in control of the states investment portfolio 
after two previous treasury employees left and having the 
treasurers office charge a service fee for handling investments in 
the fund 
manchin gainer and former gov arch moore made up the board of 
investments when the losses occurred in the consolidated investment 
fund the board had general supervisory control over the fund 
manchins office had direct investment powers 
committee members were angered by statements gainer made to them 
during 10 days of testimony on the impeachment issue they believed 
he should have been more active in the funds supervision moore 
left office in january after being unseated by gaston caperton in 
last years general election

peace activists want the shortrange rockets dismantled and not 
modernized saying they are not needed because of a lessened 
military threat from the east

it is no celebration the cherokees plan 
this week although spring brings a special joy in the adopted 
homeland where the tribe ended its greatest tragedy 150 years ago 
in the winter of 183839 thousands of cherokees died on a 
forced march from their homes in the southeastern united states to 
what is now northeastern oklahoma the path is known as the trail 
of tears 
on friday and saturday the tribe observes the sesquicentennial 
of that time the last of 14 groups of cherokees escorted by 
federal troops arrived in late march 1839 
wilma mankiller chief of the nations secondlargest indian 
tribe said cherokees decided to mark the sesquicentennial after 
some hesitation because of the sensitivity that lingers over those 
days 
the tribe settled on a commemoration only after wagon hobbyists 
not affiliated with the tribe retraced the trail of tears last 
fall ms mankiller noted most cherokees made the trek by foot 
some in shackles 
it wasnt a friendly removal she said 
i think there are a number of people who have concerns said 
ms mankiller chief since 1985 i think its healthy for us to 
look back and show respect for our ancestors 
it helps to place our present problems in a historical 
context but i certainly understand the concerns of people about 
looking at this issue 
i think for us its a very solemn very emotional time we 
look at it as something that happened to our family 
ms mankiller said the observance provides a chance to do some 
public education about our history 
theres so little accurate information about what modern 
american indians are like theres a vacuum she said 
most americans know only the indians they see depicted in john 
wayne movies ms mankiller said 
in the tribes capital of tahlequah a university city of 
10000 there will be speeches storytelling and flute playing a 
tree will be planted in honor of the estimated 4000 cherokees who 
died along the trail 
donated hogs will be cooked in huge black kettles on the grounds 
of a historic home there will be free corn bread and beans eggs 
and wild onions 
this is what the indians of the hills eat whatever food 
they could find and forage said john ketcher deputy chief of 
the tribe who remembers when his own relatives would not discuss 
the tragedy 
those forced westward included cherokees who owned plantations 
and had assimilated into the dominant white culture but the tribe 
had its own government and its own written language when president 
andrew jackson ordered the cherokees removed from land sought by 
white settlers 
ketchers greatgrandparents were on the trail uprooted from 
northern georgia 
i never did hear about the trail when i was growing up 
nothing not anything ketcher said was it just an attempt to 
shut it out like it never happened 
many of them would just prefer to forget the whole thing 
because it was such a tragic event in the lives of our people 
ms mankiller who keeps busy with speaking engagements 
nationwide said the sesquicentennial should remind tribal members 
of their resiliency 
it is intended to be sort of a solemn occasion but also 
at the same time look back about what happened after the trail of 
tears we were able to bounce back in the 1800s she said 
a commemorative plaque depicts a legendary phoenix bird arising 
from ashes to assume the form of a cherokee warrior 
the tribe arrived in oklahoma politically divided over removal 
but the tribe rebounded to reform a government enforce tribal 
laws and erect government buildings that still stand it

sales of existing homes fell in february for 
the second straight month as higher interest rates pushed buyers 
out of the market a real estate trade group said monday 
sales of existing singlefamily homes dropped 31 percent last 
month to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 344 million units 
the slowest pace since the 338 million rate recorded last march 
the national association of realtors reported 
februarys decline followed an even sharper 94 percent sales 
drop in january 
the realtors attributed the recent weakness in sales to the 
federal reserve boards yearlong campaign to drive up interest 
rates in an effort to slow the economy and ease inflationary 
pressures 
the feds credit stance is working said realtors president 
ira gribin interest rates are pushed up and buyers are pushed 
out 
fixedrate home mortgages last month averaged between 1055 
percent and 1078 percent according to the federal home loan 
mortgage corp on oneyear adjustable rate mortgages lenders were 
asking an average initial rate of between 856 percent and 873 
percent 
by last week the rates were up to 1122 percent and 930 
pecent respectively 
because lowerincome buyers generally were the ones pushed out 
of the market by the higher rates the median price of existing 
homes sold last month increased the realtors reported the median 
rose 3400 to 93100 meaning half sold for more and half for 
less 
generally in times of rising rates the people left in the 
market tend to be upperincome buyers who can buy the house they 
want regardless of less affordable financing said john tuccillo 
chief economist for the group 
he said the resale pace is not expected to drop much further 
because economic growth appears to be slowing to a level acceptable 
to the fed 
februarys decline in home sales was led by a sharp drop in the 
highpriced northeast where the market began to cool last year 
after an earlier surge in prices 
resales in the region were at a seasonally adjusted annual rate 
of 580000 last month down 183 percent from the previous month 
the median price of a home in the northeast was 142600 down 
1200 from the previous month 
the higher interest rates probably will prolong stagnation in 
some of those markets tuccillo said 
sales in the south were down 08 percent to an annual rate of 
13 million units last month with the median price in that region 
rising 6100 last month to 88500 
sales dropped 11 percent in the midwest to an annual rate of 
920000 units while the median price rose 2100 to 69900 
the west was the only region to record an increase in sales last 
month with the annual rate rising 32 percent to 650000 units 
the median price in the region was 133700 up 3000 from january 
strong economic growth in the west has made it better prepared 
to withstand credit tightening tuccillo said this region 
contains some of the hottest markets in the country now and buyers 
there seem to be less affected by hikes in interest rates

a us human rights group that monitored the 
soviet parliamentary elections said monday the system appeared to 
be efficient but there were flaws that could have led to rigging 
the results 
soviet newspapers reported some voters were disenfranchised 
because of election difficulties igor orlov the chairman of the 
moscow election commission acknowledged some snags developed in 
sundays voting the first multicandidate elections in the soviet 
union in 70 years 
david carliner an attorney with the usbased international 
human rights law group told a news conference that six delegates 
visited 17 polling stations in eight election districts 
the process appeared efficient and officials took their duty 
quite seriously he said it was clear that they did not try in 
any way to influence the voters 
voters interviewed by the delegation were satisfied that their 
ballots were secret and sacred and would be counted carliner 
said 
there were possibilities to commit election fraud however 
mainly because there werent enough soviet observers to monitor all 
polling stations he said 
at several polling stations there were no observers or 
officials present by late afternoon the lack of observers left 
open a chance to cheat carliner said anyone could have walked 
in marked up a bunch of ballots and stuffed them into the box 
in addition special voting passes had been given to many people 
such as businessmen and tourists allowing them to vote away from 
their residences he said that left the system open to abuse he 
said 
we ran up against masses of absolutely new moments currents 
and problems orlov said from the moscow city council 
headquarters some things we did satisfactorily some things did 
not get done until the end 
soviet newspapers carried complaints of people who said they 
were denied a chance to vote 
in some election districts a few disabled people were denied 
the voting right because of the inefficiency of voting 
commissions komsomolskaya pravda said 
in past elections the disabled could request a ballot box be 
brought to their residences if a person could not get to a polling 
station a relative could take the persons internal passport and 
cast the vote by proxy 
the newspaper said the election commission of the 
cheremushkinsky district responded to the complaint by saying 
they only had two portable ballot boxes and they were short of 
time 
in other districts residents did not receive the special mailed 
invitation cards needed to cast a ballot it said 
the us group has monitored elections in nicaragua uruguay 
grenada el salvador south korea and zimbabwe

seven people who were seriously injured in the 
devastating december earthquake in armenia headed home monday after 
weeks of medical care and rehabilitation in us hospitals 
they looked radiant said stephen johnson executive vice 
president of americares the medical relief organization that

the judge in the irancontra trial monday 
rejected oliver norths bid to have former president reagan appear 
in court friday as the defenses first witness but held out the 
possibility he might be called later 
us district judge gerhard a gesell said he wanted a 
succinct particularized statement of facts from norths lawyers 
on what they want to elicit from reagan before he would decide 
whether the former president must testify 
in a twopage order gesell said the defense should file that 
statement under seal by late wednesday afternoon the prosecution 
wont be permitted to see it 
north lawyer brendan sullivan asked the court last friday to 
enter an order enforcing a subpoena issued in december directing 
reagan to appear at norths trial sullivan sought to have reagan 
appear this coming friday as the defenses leadoff witness 
there is insufficient time to resolve the pending questions 
relating to president reagans personal appearance to contemplate 
his appearance by friday march 31 as requested the judge said 
gesell said a hearing date on the questions concerning reagans 
possible appearance will be scheduled based on developments at 
trial 
gesell also said he wants other issues regarding norths 
subpoena for reagan to be resolved expeditiously this week 
the trial was in recess monday and was to resume tuesday 
gesell said he wanted to know whether the expresident 
personally objects to appearing at a later date convenient for 
him or whether other arrangements for his testimony could be 
substituted 
these could include a videotaped deposition or excerpts from 
personal diaries said the judge 
the justice department acting on reagans behalf opposes 
norths subpoena 
sullivan is trying to show that reagan and his advisers approved 
norths actions the fired national security council aide is 
charged with 12 crimes including obstructing and making false 
statements to congress by denying he was involved in secretly 
assisting the contras 
sullivan said the importance of reagans testimony to the 
defense of this case is clear both from the record in the trial 
to date and from earlier arguments made by the defense 
norths lawyers have brought out at the trial that reagan 
personally approved a secret deal to slip 110 million in extra aid 
to honduras to entice the countrys government to back the contras 
the defense also introduced documents designed to show that 
reagan approved airdropping intelligence materials and recoilless 
rifles to the contras to destroy armsbearing ships headed for 
nicaragua 
reagans actions took place during a congressional ban on 
military aid to the contras

po kay in karen state located on the border with thailand the 
victory came after three days of intense fighting according to 
burmas state radio 
the broadcast said 38 government troops were killed and 189 
soldiers wounded at least 74 rebels were killed 
the traitors such as the burma communist party rebels and 
the karen national union who are lackeys of foreign powers 
continue their efforts to cause the disintegration of the 
state saw maung said at a military parade marking armed forces 
day 
saw maung seized power in a bloody coup in september when his 
troops killed hundreds of people to crush a nationwide movement for 
democracy 
on monday he repeated pledges the military will hand over power 
to the winner of a general election next year 
with the improvement of the general situation free and fair 
general elections will be held throughout the country except in 
the areas where there is no peace and tranquility because of rebel 
activities he said 
burma has been torn by ethnic clashes since gaining independence 
from britain four decades ago 
the karens with about 4000 fighters roam vast tracts of the 
southeastern border with thailand 
sundays loss of maw po kay 80 miles northwest of raheng 
thailand was considered a major defeat sources said the karens

orgy of selfcongratulation where is a jaded journalist to go for 
the other side of the story the detached indifferent listless 
and worldweary side 
alan caruba a public relations consultant is meeting that 
need as creator of the boring institute he says his phone has 
been ringing constantly with interview requests prompted by his 
satirical most boring lists 
carubas latest released march 20 was the most boring film 
awards a sendup of the academy awards 
eddie murphy is a big winner for his two 1988 releases raw 
and coming to america which caruba says run the gamut from 
merely vulgar to monotonously obscene 
the institute will surface again in july with national 
antiboredom month followed in september by fearless forecasts 
of tvs fall flops the most boring celebrities of the year 
in december resulted in 200 radio interviews for caruba 
caruba a 51yearold bachelor who still lives with his parents 
in the house where he was raised says the popularity of his 
lampoon confirms his beliefs about americas mediaglutted society 
the american public is being exploited cynically by film 
producers and people who choose what television programs they see 
we are asked to live our lives vicariously through others 
primarily on television he said 
the irony of the boring institute of course is that carubas 
diatribes are approaching the level of exposure that he is 
criticizing 
its a kind of commentary on our times he said

the white house trying to put an end to an 
embarrassing episode today brushed aside a complaint from 
president bushs legal counsel about the new contra aid agreement 
and issued what amounted to a public rebuke of the official 
in a highly unusual move white house counsel c boyden gray was 
quoted sunday as saying the agreement encroached on the presidents 
power to conduct foreign policy privately white house officials 
were perplexed that gray would go public with a challenge to a 
policy bush had embraced 
bush sidestepped a question about whether he was angry at gray 
mingling with thousands of children on the south lawn during the 
annual easter egg roll bush said on a day like this im not 
angry at anybody 
white house press secretary marlin fitzwater said gray met with 
chief of staff john sununu today they had a polite discussion 
about how things work in the white house fitzwater said 
asked why gray would have felt that the agreement had not 
received proper legal review fitzwater replied i just cant 
tell you what was in boyden grays mind thats more than i can 
handle 
fitzwaters comments amounted to a rare public rebuke of another 
senior white house official the press secretary was asked whether 
gray had been told that he should work through proper channels 
instead of taking his complaints to the press 
i dont know that they did tell him that fitzwater said 
i think thats a good idea id tell him that 
fitzwater added all the appropriate discussions have been 
commenced and completed with mr gray and he fully understands our 
position the spokesman said boyden simply explained his 
concerns and they were met and thats pretty much the end of it 
baker played down the dispute and insisted that the accord does 
not surrender presidential power to congress 
this is a voluntary agreement baker said sunday you do 
not have the question arise here with respect to constitutional 
powers and prerogatives because the congress is not imposing its 
will in effect through legislation 
gray himself tried to play down the dispute today during the 
daily meeting of senior white house officials he told his 
colleagues that reports of his concerns were overstated and that he 
didnt think there were any problems with the agreement according 
to an official who declined to be identified 
he basically backed off the official said theres a lot 
of discussion of this and a feeling that it was really a somewhat 
bizarre occurrence and shouldnt have happened 
the episode marked grays second runin with baker one of the 
most powerful figures in the bush administration earlier gray had 
raised questions about the propriety of bakers financial holdings 
and the secretary later disposed of the assets 
gray did not return telephone calls seeking comment 
gray had expressed concern in a new york times interview about a 
provision giving any of four congressional committees the power to 
cut off aid to the nicaraguan rebels after november if lawmakers 
conclude that the contras continued presence is harming central 
american peace efforts 
gray said the provision was much more than a gentlemans 
agreement because its in writing and becomes a precedent 
although not as serious as if it were in legislation 
both baker and white house national security adviser brent 
scowcroft said on television news shows sunday that they did not 
agree with gray on the subject but neither would criticize him 
directly with baker sidestepping questions about the dispute 
a television interviewer noted that it was gray who a few 
weeks ago embarrassed you publicly by calling attention to stock 
held by baker in a bank with major outstanding loans to foreign 
countries 
now he is complaining that you have made a deal that is wrong 
is there room for both of you in this administration 
nice try sam replied baker the fact of the matter is 
the president the chief of staff the national security adviser to 
the president and i all discussed this particular provision so 
good try 
so you dont care to predict how long c boyden gray will be 
in the administration persisted a second questioner 
good try david replied baker 
president bush appearing at the white house with congressional 
leaders from both parties to announce the deal last friday hailed 
it as a return to a bipartisan foreign policy the previous 
administration repeatedly failed to reach accord with congress on 
central america 
congress voted to end military aid to the contras in 1988 and 
the current appropriation of 271 million in humanitarian aid ends 
next friday contra forces are now encamped across the border in 
honduras 
under the new agreement negotiated by baker and congressional 
leaders congress would vote after its easter recess to send the 
contras 45 million a month in nonmilitary aid through february 
1990 
the administration meanwhile would pledge in writing to pursue 
diplomatic means to end fighting in central america 
nicaraguas leftist sandinista government has committed itself 
to hold free elections in february 1990 according to an earlier 
accord among central american presidents 
nicaraguan foreign minister alejandro bendano interviewed by 
satellite on the abctv program this week with david brinkley 
said that the us policy still was out of step with what the 
central american presidents have agreed upon because it would not 
disband the contras 
baker also appearing on abc said that the accord among central 
american presidents called for an agreement by may 15 on 
demobilizing the contras but not their immediate dissolution 
if the sandinistas do not hold elections as promised said 
baker the united states might use sticks that would involve 
tightening economic sanctions further diplomatic sanctions and 
there is nothing in this agreement that would foreclose the 
presidents future request for military assistance should things 
deteriorate substantially

a crewman without proper certification was 
in command when an exxon tanker apparently hit two rocks and ran 
aground causing the nations biggest oil spill the company said 
officials said a third mate was in command against company 
policy at the time of friday mornings accident that sent an 
estimated 101 million gallons of crude oil into prince williams 
sound south of here and prompted the governor sunday to declare the 
sound a disaster area the exxon valdez crewman did not have the 
proper license to legally operate such a large ship in the sound 
officials said 
exxon shipping co spokesman brian dunphy said sunday that the 
captain joseph hazelwood was in the cabin at the time of the 
grounding but today he said the captains whereabouts are 
uncertain throughout the entire incident it is known he was not on 
the bridge for the complete time 
both he and another company spokesman sharon curranwescott 
said that even if hazelwood was present during part of the time on 
the bridge he was not in command 
we do know the captain was not in command ms 
curranwescott said he apparently may have been physically 
present on the bridge 
dunphy said hazelwood was consulting an attorney 
meanwhile winds topping 25 knots this morning forced 
postponement of efforts to clean up the sound with chemicals to 
disperse the oil or fire to burn it off 
some of the cleanup operations such as the use of skimmers 
and also dispersants and the burn technique have been put on 
hold dunphy said he said he was unsure if the weather would 
improve enough to allow cleanup to begin later in the day 
he said crews using three pumps had managed to move 78000 
barrels of oil from the exxon valdez to another tanker the exxon 
baton rouge as of 6 am and workers planned to bring in four 
more pumps todayto speed up the rate of unloading 
based on the findings of divers the company believes the tanker 
had struck one rock a glancing blow and was already leaking when it 
struck a second time and ran around said exxon shipping co 
president frank iarossi were surmising there had to be two 
events he said but he didnt know how many minutes apart they 
might have taken place 
coast guard officials said they could not confirm whether the 
tanker hit bottom more than once or say what crew memers were on 
the bridge at the time of the accident 
oil traders and analysts predicted crude oil prices would rise 
temporarily because it forced the closing of the port of valdez 
southern terminus of the alyeska pipeline that carries all crude 
oil from alaskas north slope cutting us crude supplies by a 
quarter 
in todays early trading the may contract for west texas 
intermediate the benchmark grade of us crude oil was up 57 
cents from thursdays close trading at 2072 per 42gallon barrel 
on the new york mercantile exchange 
alaska gov steve cowper on sunday declared the wildliferich 
sound a disaster area and said he would seek federal funds to help 
with the spill which the coast guard estimates has affected about 
100 square miles oil has washed up on two islands and sightings 
were reported of dozens of crudecoated birds 
also sunday officials said the government authorized use of 
chemicals and fire to combat the massive slick 
before winds forced postponement of the effort iarossi had said 
officials planned to use a c130 aircraft today to spray chemicals 
to disperse patches of oil in a 5squaremile area of the sound 
the company also planned to burn fingers of the slick by 
igniting them with a laser 
the volume of oil released in the water is for all intents 
and purposes beyond control by mechanical means alone iarossi 
said 
iarossi said the latest estimate of damage to the tanker is 
eight damaged oil cargo tanks and two damaged ballast tanks 
at the time of the disaster friday third mate gregory cousins 
was in command and his actions violated federal regulations said 
ms curranwescott 
he didnt have a proper pilots license for that he wasnt 
authorized by the company nor was it legal she said 
neither hazelwood nor cousins could be located in valdez by the 
associated press for comment 
the national transportation safety board took over the 
investigation sunday one day after issuing subpoenas for 
hazelwood cousins and helmsman robert kagan the third member of 
the bridge crew results of routine drug and alcohol tests 
administered to the three werent immediately available officials 
said 
the ntsb slated hearings for next week in anchorage 
hazelwood was relieved of his command but to give him rest not 
as a disciplinary measure officials said 
the 987foot tanker exxon valdez carrying 12 million barrels 
of north slope crude oil ran onto a reef 25 miles from port early 
friday after swinging out of a traffic lane to avoid ice valdez is 
at the southern end of the 800mile alaska oil pipeline 
estimates put the spill at 240000 barrels of oil or about 101 
million gallons making it the biggest us spill on record the 
only larger oilrelated accident in us waters involved 107 
million gallons of oil when two ships collided in galveston bay in 
1979 but that oil burned as well as spilled 
this oil spill may well be the greatest disaster to hit alaska 
since the good friday earthquake 25 years ago cowper said 
a wildlife specialist toured the sound and observed 75 ducks and 
two otters coated with oil said us department of interior 
spokeswoman pamela bergmann 
a station was set up to clean birds and a mammalcleaning 
station also was planned 
fishermen fearing lost income have sought compensation from the 
shipping company exxon officials said 
were not ready to absorb any loss said riki ott 
spokeswoman for united fishermen of alaska we expect full 
compensation 
more than four miles of floating boom has been placed in an 
effort to contain the oil the coast guard said skimming boats 
worked to remove the oil 
the transfer to a second ship of oil remaining aboard the valdez 
resumed during the weekend and the coast guard said it could take 
seven days to unload the damaged vessel 
iarossi said 36000 gallons of chemicals that were to be used to 
break up the oil were in anchorage and 19000 were to be flown from 
texas fishermen and other users of the resourcerich sound have 
expressed concerns about additional damage that could be done by 
chemicals 
environmentalists the governor and other state officials have 
accused exxon and alyeska pipeline service co of responding too 
slowly to the spill alyeska operates the oilloading terminal at 
valdez 
both companies said they were satisfied with how the problem was 
being handled 
were proceeding cautiously said exxon spokesman tom 
cirigliano we want to make sure we dont make any mistakes in 
cleaning up the spill 
under the terms of the law authoritizing the alaska pipeline 
the owneroperator of an oil tanker has strict liability for the 
first 14 million in damage from a spill according to oil spill 
intelligence report a weekly publication in arlington mass 
if damage exceeds 14 million claims are paid out of a reserve 
that is funded by a tariff on oil companies alaskan production 
the reserve has 300 million and can pay up to 100 million per 
spill

premier turgut ozal on monday pledged to 
stay in office until the end of his term in 1992 despite the 
stunning defeat suffered by his motherland party in nationwide 
local elections 
opposition parties had cast sundays election as a referendum on 
ozals freemarket policies and ozal had vowed to resign if 
opposition gains were large enough to make it difficult for him to 
govern 
the governing party came third in the provincial assembly 
elections behind the leftist social democrat populist party and the 
conservative true path party of former premier suleyman demirel 
the motherland party won only three mayorships in turkeys 67 
provincial capitals down from 54 mayorships it captured in local 
elections five years ago 
demirel called on ozal to be true to his word and resign 
ozal promised to shuffle his cabinet but said he would stay in 
office 
the nation gave us a mandate until 1992 we will be serving 
the nation until then ozal 61 told a news conference 
in a statement to foreign correspondents ozal said the election 
results would not affect in any way the political balance and 
the parliamentary arithmetic the turkish governments 
international economic policy and relations will continue 
unchanged 
apparently giving assurances to the international business 
community the statement said our engagements including joint 
venture arrangements would suffer no modification 
the motherland party has a 292seat majority in the 450seat 
legislature 
political analysts attributed ozals loss to inflation that rose 
to 75 percent in 1988 his familys freespending lifestyle 
charges of nepotism and alleged corruption by state officials 
the people knew the party in power would not change as a 
result of these elections they wanted to give us a message to 
bring down inflation faster the premier said 
he said a little warning was intended by the voters but it 
went a bit too far 
voters elected more than 326000 provincial assembly members 
city council members mayors village leaders and neighborhood 
representatives 
in the provincial assembly elections the social democrats got 
28 percent of the vote nationwide and the true path had 255 
percent ozals party was in third place with 22 percent down from 
41 percent in local elections five years ago 
the rest of the votes were split among four smaller parties 
the social democrats won 31 mayorships out of 54 already 
decided and the true path won 15

would consider appealing the sentence which included five years on 
probation

the army has refused for nine months to accept 
delivery of a new version of its potent stinger antiaircraft 
missile because the heatseeking weapon sometimes can be fooled by 
flares officials said monday 
capt barry d bomier an army spokesman at the pentagon said 
the problem with the socalled stingerrmp is considered relatively 
minor despite the delay in taking deliveries from the general 
dynamics corp the missiles producer 
bomier said testing of a fixed version of the new missile is 
under way and we dont expect it to take much longer 
we expect the problem that we have can be resolved with 
modifications to the computer software in the guidance 
system he said 
but the army is not going to accept that missile until it can 
do what we expect it to do and what is written into our contract 
general dynamics acknowledged through its washington office 
monday there had been a problem with the stingerrmp and that it 
was working with the army to correct it 
but jim gilkerson a spokesman for general dynamics valley 
systems division in rancho cucamonga calif where the missile is 
made refused monday to discuss when the new round of testing might 
be completed and deliveries started 
the stinger renowned for its performance in afghanistan where 
it helped usbacked resistance fighters overcome soviet air 
power is a shoulderfired missile for use against airplanes or 
helicopters 
the basic stinger delivered to the army in 1979 is a 
heatseeking missile and can be fooled by some types of flares the 
stingerrmp is designed to overcome that problem with a more 
sophisticated guidance system 
the rmp in the name stands for reprogrammable 
microprocessor the new missile features removable computer 
software that can be updated to compensate for new types of flares 
or threats as they develop 
the problem that general dynamics is working to correct surfaced 
during final testing of the new missile and involves the missiles 
failure to ignore certain types of flares when they are ejected 
from a hovering helicopter 
army and corporate officials decline to elaborate further 
citing security classifications but stress the problem crops up 
only in one situation and that even with the one flaw the 
stingerrmp is a much more effective weapon that the basic stinger 
the weapon works bomier said the problem involves only 
one target under certain selected conditions we havent stopped 
buying the missile we just havent accepted it yet 
the army has awarded two contracts to general dynamics for the 
stingerrmp they total about 900 million and call for delivery of 
about 23000 of the missiles through may 1991 
in the meantime the older models of the missile still are being 
used 
general dynamics continues to produce the new missile while the 
fix is developed for the computer software and it is warehousing 
them in the interim bomier said the company is paying the cost of 
storage

new york state sued the federal government 
monday for 157 million in welfare reimbursements that state 
officials charge washington has illegally withheld 
state social service officials charged in the lawsuit filed in 
federal court in new york city that the federal government has 
refused to give state and its local governments money owed for five 
separate years dating to 1979 
the reimbursements are the federal share of the aid for families 
with dependent children program dealing with children placed in 
foster care state social services commissioner cesar perales said 
federal officials have never acknowledged that new york filed for 
the reimbursements 
we are paying we are providing the service perales told 
reporters the issue here is that the federal government is not 
paying its share 
perales said just about every other state is owed money 
totaling about 600 million he mentioned california and texas as 
two states with a similar problem 
were talking about a system in which the federal government 
says were going to help you finance the care of your children in 
foster care perales said we rely on that trust and 
relationship we are relying on the good faith of the federal 
government 
david siegel a spokesman at the us family support 
administration said he had not seen the lawsuit and could not 
immediately comment the agency part the department of health and 
human services administers the foster care program 
the 157 million consists of reimbursements the state claims 
its owed for 1979 1980 1983 1987 and 1988 perales said some 
50 million would go to the state about 80 million would go to 
new york city and 27 million would go to other local governments 
said state attorney general robert abrams 
the federal government estimates how much the state will need to 
run the foster care program each quarter according to abrams and 
perales washington is supposed to reimburse the state whenever 
actual costs for the quarter are higher than the federal estimate 
but didnt in these cases 
abrams a democrat accused the republican reagan administration 
of trying to balance the federal deficit on the backs of those 
who can least afford to deal with that problem individuals who 
are vulnerable who are disabled

it will take something more than a nuclear 
attack to wipe out your obligations to the internal revenue service 
however an addition to the internal revenue manual which is 
supposed to guide the conduct of all irs employees acknowledges 
that tax collection might suffer if the bomb is dropped once the 
emergency is over the manual declares operations will be 
concentrated on collecting the taxes which will produce the greater 
revenue yield 
irs spokesman johnell hunter said monday that the new section 
titled national emergency operations was added to the manual 
in response to a directive to government departments from the 
federal emergency management agency the twopage policy statement 
is dated dec 14 1988 
in the event of a national emergency especially resulting 
from nuclear attack the primary function of the service is to 
support the secretary of the treasury the manual states this 
support as a minimum will consist of analyzing and reporting upon 
emergency tax legislation prescribing regulations and forms 
issuing rulings and technical information of an emergency nature 
within 30 days after an attack emergency the agency would 
expect to resume assessing and collecting taxes at that time the 
manual states many employees might find themselves reassigned to 
carry out essential functions regardless of and without any 
effect on the current positions or grades of the employee 
on the premise that the collection of delinquent accounts 
would be most adversely affected and in many cases would be 
impossible in a disaster area the service will concentrate on the 
collection of current taxes the manual says however in areas 
where the taxpaying potential is substantially unimpaired enforced 
collection of delinquent accounts will be continued

differences will remain between china and the 
soviet union even after they resume normal diplomatic relations at 
their first summit in 30 years chinas foreign minister said 
monday 
soviet support for vietnams invasion of cambodia is regarded by 
china as the most serious obstacle to better ties between beijing 
and moscow and foreign minister qian qichen said the issue will be 
high on the agenda when soviet president mikhail s gorbachev 
visits china in may 
qian told a news conference that the visit will lead to normal 
diplomatic relations but there will still be some way to go and 
some efforts to be made before two countries resolve all their 
differences 
qian said china which supports the antivietnamese resistance 
in cambodia backs the dispatch of a un peacekeeping force after 
vietnam ends its 10year occupation 
he said china is not preparing to send troops to cambodia to 
participate in a proposed peacekeeping force 
the chinesesoviet summit the first since nikita s khrushchev 
and mao tsetung met in 1959 follows the withdrawal of soviet 
troops from afghanistan and a soviet announcement this month it 
would withdraw of 75 percent the 50000 soviet forces from mongolia 
two soviet moves to ease its longstrained relationship with 
china 
khrushchev and mao later clashed over ideology and soviet and 
chinese troops clashed in the 1960s and 1970s along the 4670mile 
border 
at the news conference qian said sinous relations have 
progressed smoothly since diplomatic ties were formed a decade ago 
relations he said enjoy vast potential and the prospects are 
very good 
but he also called on a new pattern of relations based on 
mutual trust and had sharp words for members of the us congress 
who have criticized chinas lack of democratic reform and its human 
rights record in tibet 
a small number of people in the american congress are actually 
very illinformed about the situation in tibet they have very 
strong prejudice 
china last week criticized both the european parliament and the 
us congress for statements concerning the declaration of martial 
law in the tibetan capital of lhasa following proindependence 
riots this month 
qian said the lhasa rioters were trying to split the chinese 
nation and foreign nations that raise the human rights question are 
interfering in chinas internal affairs 
human rights he added are a matter of basic questions such as 
providing adequate food and education and are inseparable with 
the actual condition of the country involved 
he noted china still has 200 million illiterate people there 
are things that can be easily achieved in some countries but not in 
others

a travel service that arranges trips to cuba for 
cuban exiles has been bombed the 11th attack in two years on 
agencies that handle passengers and packages bound for the 
communist island 
federal and local authorities said monday they are renewing 
their investigation of the case 
militant anticommunist cuban exiles are the prime suspects in 
the bombings 
just before midnight sunday two small bombs blasted holes in the 
outside wall of marazul charters the only company authorized to 
handle trips for cuban exiles wanting to visit their homeland no 
one was hurt but the explosion also shattered a window and light 
fixtures in businesses across a narrow canal 
were actively investigating but we havent identified a 
suspect yet said george kiszynski spokesman for the miami fbi 
office he said the metrodade police bomb squad was gathering 
evidence to identify the detonation method for the two bombs 
there have been 13 similar bombings in the miami area over the 
last two years 11 at agencies doing business with cuba one aimed 
at an art museum showing work by cuban artists and one at the home 
of the sponsor of a forum on uscuban relations 
marazuls owner francisco aruca has spoken in favor of closer 
relations with cuba an anathema to some in miamis anticastro 
community 
the bombings were the work of fanatical and radical elements 
in the community aruca said monday anyone who perceives a 
softening of the attitude toward a dialogue with castro can expect 
to have that happen to them 
the bombing apparently did not frighten off marazuls customers 
who often have to wait months for seats on the twiceaweek charter 
flights to visit relatives in cuba 
my husband would like to see his mother before she dies 
hilda aybar said while waiting in front of the agency i dont 
see why he shouldnt go 
threats phoned to marazul and other agencies criticize them for 
indirectly supporting castro by providing hard currency to cuba 
and more broadly by softening attitudes toward the communist 
government

the commander of lebanons christian army 
units has asked president bush to support his drive to expel all 
syrian troops from his country officials said monday 
in a letter to bush gen michel aoun said he was determined to 
achieve the withdrawal of all foreign troops from lebanon said a 
us official who saw the letter the official spoke only on 
condition he not be named 
syria maintains 40000 troops in beirut and eastern lebanon 
while israeli forces estimated to number about 1000 and an 
allied christian militia patrol a cordon of southern lebanon along 
the border with israel 
aoun contends the syrians who intervened in lebanon 13 years 
ago as peacekeepers have turned into an occupation force by taking 
sides with moslems and druse he heads a christian military cabinet 
in lebanons divided government while syria backs the rival moslem 
government 
in his campaign to drive out the syrians aouns predominantly 
christian units have been engaged since march 8 in a fierce 
artillery battle in beirut with an alliance of syrian troops and 
militiamen of druse warlord walid jumblatts progressive socialist 
party the fighting is considered the worst beirut has known in 
recent years 
in his letter aoun said he sees himself as the spearhead 
for removing syrian forces and restoring the countrys sovereignty 
the us official said 
he wanted to gauge our reaction to this and our ability to 
assist he added 
aoun did not ask for any specific help rather he wants us 
understanding for his plan and moral support the official said 
bush will be responding to the letter likely reiterating the 
us position of neutrality in the conflict he said 
the state department issued two statements last week urging 
christians moslems and syrians to cease fire and negotiate either 
directly or through the arab league 
us officials are in contact with all sides in an obvious show 
of neutrality but have refused to mediate after failing last year 
in mediation attempts between the christians and syrians

labor secretary elizabeth dole on monday urged 
breaking down bureaucratic barriers between programs aimed at 
preventing school dropouts saying a fragmented piecemeal 
programmatic approach doesnt work 
she began a 10city factfinding tour of labor department 
regional offices during which she is meeting with officials and 
students in youth job training and employment programs the tour 
ends april 4 in boston 
we need a way to tie together the programs both federally and 
most definitely at the community level she told civic leaders 
teachers and students in atlantas exodus program founded in 
atlanta in 1971 to combat georgias 34 percent dropout rate the 
program now is in 31 cities 
she said her tour is designed to help learn which programs work 
and which do not 
mrs dole said the information will be used to start programs to 
identify needs of individual students in 12 cities to be picked 
later these are to be converted to model programs in five cities 
she said current programs often overlap or duplicate each other 
and lack followup studies 
mrs dole said much of what she referred to as the skills gap 
and the motivation gap is rooted in a time when there were fewer 
possibilities for young people in the job market and when 
expectations were lower 
everyone can have a job today who wants a job if he has the 
skills she said but youve got to have the skills 
its a new day mrs dole said weve got a real mission 
here together to accomplish this 
mrs dole said she believes her primary goal is to ensure that 
the united states has the besttrained labor force in the world 
but she noted that youth unemployment nationally is at 16 percent 
and that minority youth unemployment is at 35 percent or even 
higher in some areas 
we must look at our own situation she said adding that she 
will urge other federal departments such as education and health 
and human services to tie programs together with the labor 
department are we training people for the jobs of yesterday or 
the jobs of tomorrow

articles of impeachment were sent 
monday to the full house against state treasurer a james manchin 
who was charged with improper handling of a fund that lost 279

direct investment power of the treasurer 
house speaker chuck chambers said the 100member house is 
expected to take up the resolution wednesday a simple majority is 
needed to send it to the senate 
senate president larry tucker anticipating manchins 
impeachment by the house told the senate last week to be prepared 
to sit as a jury in late may 
it would take 23 yes votes in the senate twothirds of the

americans arent responding to president 
bushs thousand points of light message by giving more time and 
money to charity a poll released monday says 
most of the 1010 people polled by the marist institute of 
public opinion said they planned no changes in the time they 
volunteer to charity or money they give said dennis murray 
president of marist college in poughkeepsie 
bush as part of his call for a kinder and gentler america 
has asked americans to give more time and money to charity 
most people feel that they are giving at their limit and are 
giving a fair amount said murray author of the guaranteed 
fundraising system 
half the people polled said they donate time to a religious 
group or civic or community organization eightyfive percent of 
americans contribute money to churches charities or civic groups 
the poll found 
slightly more than twothirds of the respondents said theyd 
give the same amount of time and money to charity in 1989 as they 
did last year the survey found 19 percent planned to give more 
money this year and 12 percent would give less largely because 
they had more or less money to spend 
similarly 83 percent of those who dont volunteer time now 
dont plan to change their habits the survey found 
the people who are in positions of leadership in this country 
be they religious political or civic leaders are going to have to 
make a very clear case for additional giving and additional 
involvement murray said 
nonprofit groups need to better show how the money and time 
makes a direct impact murray said too many groups seem more 
preoccupied with their fundraising than what the money is actually 
going to do he said 
the people who are involved and are already giving understand 
what the social needs are he said 
the survey conducted by telephone in the lower 48 states from 
jan 29 to feb 1 also found that women are more likely than men 
to give time or money to charity the margin of error was plus or 
minus 35 percent

the state department on monday urged the 
marxist government of angola to accept a peace proposal put forth 
by usbacked rebel leader jonas savimbi 
the proposals by savimbis national union of the total 
independence of angola unita are a significant step in that 
direction and are deserving of broad support state department 
spokeswoman margaret tutwiler said 
she said the united states urged the government in luanda to 
respond positively to unitas gestures and offer of peace 
savimbi who has been fighting the government for 14 years has 
called a fourmonth halt to attacks on cubanaided government 
troops in order to bring about peace talks 
he also has pledged not to interfere with reconstruction of the 
strategic eastwest benguela railway destroyed by rebel attacks 
and he said he would be willing to release 100 captured government 
soldiers 
the united states which gives unita an estimated 15 million in 
weapons annually has been embarrassed by recent reports of human 
rights violations by savimbi 
savimbi has denied the reports which include allegations that 
he ordered the torture and killings of rebel dissidents and us 
officials say they are investigating 
unita wants to take advantage of a recently signed 
ussponsored agreement for the withdrawal of cuban troops from 
angola in order to start talks on power sharing with the government 
but so far the government has refused to negotiate with the 
rebels even though there is little prospect for a military victory 
by either side savimbi acknowledges he cannot win a conventional 
war against the cubanbacked government forces but his rebels have 
for years controlled about a third of the country

the agriculture department said monday that 
either ordinary lactose milk sugar or another sugar from a 
mediterranean plant can sharply reduce the amount of common food 
poisoning bacteria in the intestines of chickens destined for the 
consumer market 
preliminary tests showed that the number of salmonella bacteria 
in infected chickens can be reduced in a significant number of the 
birds by 999 percent for a cost of pennies a day said usda 
biochemist john r deloach of the agricultural research service 
college station texas 
deloach said in a report issued here by the agency that lactose 
and dmannose were added to the drinking water of chicks dosed with 
100 million salmonella typhirmurium bacteria 
when the 10dayold chicks were compared with birds that had 
received the bacteria but no sugars only 53 percent of the birds 
on lactose and only 26 percent of those on dmannose had any 
salmonella bacteria he said 
its not only important how many birds had salmonella but how 
many salmonella bacteria those birds had deloach said the 
birds treated with either mannose or lactose had 999 percent fewer 
salmonella than the control birds in those experiments 
deloach added lactose worked just as well as mannose and the 
cost of lactose in drinking water might be no more than two cents 
per bird right now if the poultry producer put his birds on 
dmannose for 10 days it would cost him 50 cents a bird 
the exact amount of bacterial contamination in poultry is 
unclear but usda and private estimates have ranged from 35 percent 
to 60 percent nationally salmonella and other organisms can be 
spread when slaughtered birds are put through eviscerating machines 
and their intestinal contents are spilled 
deloach was part of a team studying salmonella at the agencys 
veterinary toxicology research unit at college station 
dmannose is produced naturally by the fraxinus ornus plant 
along the mediterranean basin the report said the sugar 
seminose and carubinose is available commercially in the united 
states a sister compound mannitol has been used for years as a 
stabilizer and preservative in pharmaceutical products 
the report said dmannose reduces the ability of salmonella 
bacteria to settle in a chickens intestines forcing the organisms 
to pass harmlessly out of the bird studies are still under way on 
how lactose works

here is a look at some other major oil spills and their effects 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
the 220000ton tanker amoco cadiz owned by a subsidiary of 
standard oil of indiana ran aground march 16 1978 after tow 
lines snapped impaling the vessel on rocks two miles off the 
western french coast 
at least 68 million gallons of light gulf crude oil spilled out 
along about 100 miles of brittany coastline the spill created an 
oil slick 18 miles wide and 80 miles long blackened beaches and 
killed thousands of birds and millions of sea creatures local 
industries such as tourism fishing and particularly the oyster 
industry were seriously affected 
the french government has paid out as much as 100 million in 
cleanup costs and compensation to those affected by the spill in 
february a judge recommended a 1152 million judgment against 
amoco corp with the french government slated to recieve 444 
million and affected towns about 75 million 
today brittanys beaches are again clean the fishermen are at 
work again and the oyster beds productive but insidious damages 
like the death of small animals which other fish had fed from have 
caused the gradual disappearance of certain species and officials 
say the total fallout from the pollution has not yet been evaluated

officials said monday the attack by 
moslem guerrillas around jalalabad was collapsing and the rest of 
the country was very calm and quiet 
a foreign ministry spokesman would not rule out the possibility 
however that the guerrillas were regrouping to continue the fight 
at jalalabad their first major offensive since soviet military 
forces withdrew feb 15 
in islamabad pakistan a guerrilla group claimed 53 soldiers 
were killed and five aircraft shot down in weekend fighting around 
the strategic city on the main road from kabul to the pakistani 
border 
the afghan news agency associated with rebel leader gulbaddin 
hekmatyar said insurgents had captured several army posts north of 
jalalabad in heavy fighting since saturday 
it gave no figures on guerrilla casualties but on sunday the 
official afghan radio said nearly 350 were killed claims by the 
two sides usually conflict and no independent confirmation is 
possible 
mohammad nabi amani the foreign ministry spokesman in kabul 
said guerrillas fired only 250 rockets and shells at jalalabad in 
the 24hour period ending at sundown monday compared with 12000 
in the previous 24 hours 
our armed forces detected their place of attack and shelled 
them he told reporters as a result 190 of the extremists 
were killed and 70 were wounded 
he said two government soldiers and three civilians were killed 
and five soldiers and nine civilians wounded 
extremists is what the government calls the guerrillas who 
begqan fighting after a communist coup in april 1978 soviet 
soldiers arrived in december 1979 and an estimated 115000 were in 
afghanistan when the unmediated withdrawal began last may 
despite the lull he reported in fighting at jalalabad 75 miles 
east of kabul amani said it was too soon for foreign journalists 
to visit 
asked whether the reported decline in guerrilla activity could 
mean they were regrouping for a fresh attack he said were of 
the opinion that they are drawing a conclusion that they cannot 
achieve any success through military means but whether they 
would attack again was open to question 
a guerrilla victory there would give them control of their first 
major city and provide a base for the interim government they 
elected feb 23 in pakistan 
except for minor military activities in border provinces 
including herat the rest of the nation led a very calm and quiet 
life and at jalalabad the attacks are weakening and 
disintegrating he said 
herat is near the the border with iran afghanistans neighbor 
to the west and the base for eight predominantly shiite moslem 
insurgent groups the shiites frequently are at odds with the seven 
predominantly sunni moslem groups that operate from pakistan 
amani claimed pakistani miitiamen and advisers from saudi arabia 
had been killed fighting with the guerrillas but he gave no 
figures abdul haq a rebel commander outside kabul claimed in a 
report mailed to news organizaions that indian military advisers 
and pilots were with afghan forces near the soviet border 
officials in kabul often claim pakistani troops along with us 
and saudi military advisers help the insurgents all three 
countries acknowledge supporting the guerrillas but deny direct 
involvement 
previous guerrilla reports have said indian and soviet pilots 
were bombing their forces but both countries deny it 
the foreign ministry spokesman said he was incorrctly informed 
sunday when he told reporters all passengers on two small buses 
were killed by guerrilla rocket attacks he said a number 
survived and were in kabul hospitals 
one attack occurred on the jalalabadkabul highway and the other 
on the road linking kabul with the northeastern province of 
laghman amani said 
kabul a city of 22 million was quiet monday and has been for 
a week

the improving us trade deficit the biggest 
factor promoting domestic growth last year is on the verge of 
stalling out unless the bush administration moves quickly to 
devalue the dollar and reach a budget agreement with congress a 
research institute warned monday 
the institute for international economics said that unless the 
united states is able to get its trade problems under control the 
country faces the threat of a recession triggered by the flight of 
foreigners from us investments 
there is also a danger that rising trade deficit would force 
congress and the administration to erect protectionist trade 
barriers that would threaten a global trade war according to the 
study american trade adjustment the global impact 
the report said without needed policy changes americas trade 
deficit will begin rising again in 1990 and by 1992 will surpass 
the record imbalance of 154 billion set in 1987 
the forecast covers the current account the broadest measure of 
us trade because it includes not only trade in merchandise but 
also trade in services primarily investment flows between 
countries 
the current account deficit shrank 12 percent to 135 billion in 
1988 as a boom in us export sales accounted for almost half of 
total economic growth last year 
the report said this improvement was about to stall out because 
high us consumption spending was continuing to pull in imports 
while the dollars value was not low enough to spur further gains 
in us export sales 
the report recommended that the bush administration persuade 
americas major allies to accept a further devaluation of the 
dollar it said the dollar needed to drop another 25 percent 
against the yen and another 20 percent against the west german mark 
since february 1987 the united states has promoted a 
dollarstabilization effort in the face of protests from us 
allies including japan and west germany that the greenback 
already had fallen enough from its highs in 1985 
the report called on the bush administration to work with 
congress to meet the targets of the grammrudman deficit reduction 
law which calls for a balanced budget by 1993 
william cline a senior fellow at the institute and the author 
of the report said a reduction in the federal budget deficit would 
dampen the growth of domestic demand in this country and thus 
reduce americas appetite for foreign goods 
the study said if the bush administration and congress act 
quickly to implement the budget cuts it would accomplish the shift 
from a consumptiondriven economy to an exportdriven economy 
without a recession 
c fred bergsten director of the institute said the risks of a 
recession are greater now because in the past three years america 
has borrowed an additional 428 billion from the rest of the world 
to finance its huge current account deficits those deficits mean 
that americans are handing over billions of dollars to foreigners 
to pay for imported products 
unless the trade improvements are resumed americas net debt 
will top 1 trillion by the end of 1992 the report forecast the 
net debt represents the excess in foreign investments in this 
country over what americans own overseas 
the growing debt burdens run the risk of a collapse of 
confidence in the dollar triggering a further surge of inflation 
and interest rates and possibly a recession the report said 
cline said the administration should have as a goal lowering the 
current account deficit from 150 billion to an annual rate of 50 
billion which he said was a more realistic figure than trying for 
total elimination of the deficit 
the report which used computer models to simulate global trade 
flows reached these other conclusions 
the us trade deficit would drop by 9 billion to 13 billion 
in 1992 for every percentage point boost in growth in the economies 
of americas major trading partners 
the trade deficit would narrow by between 8 billion and 10 
billion in 1992 for every percentage point decline in the dollars 
exchange rate value the report said the tradeweighted value of 
the dollar against all currencies needed to fall by 10 percent 
the trade deficit would improve by 15 billion for every 
percentage point drop in americas economic growth rate reflecting 
a lower demand for imports

specializes in studies of international economic issues it 
receives its financial support from private foundations and 
corporations both in the united states and overseas

boris n yeltsin completed a stunning political 
comeback with his landslide victory over a candidate who symbolized 
power and prestige 
yet his broad base of political support translates to little 
real power in his bid to challenge the government and the communist 
party bureaucracy 
yeltsin rolled up more than 89 percent of the vote to defeat 
technocrat yevgeny brakov for a seat representing all of moscow in 
sundays first multicandidate national balloting in 70 years of 
soviet power together with the defeats of highranking officials 
in other areas of the country it is a warning of popular 
discontent with entrenched officials and their privileges 
the victory restored the burly 58yearold sverdlovsk native to 
a place of prominence in moscow giving the onetime protege of 
president mikhail s gorbachev a parliamentary seat representing 
the city he used to run as communist party chief 
but it is only one of 2250 seats in a body that meets once a 
year to elect a president and a new more active legislative body 
the supreme soviet 
gorbachev has said he wants all members of the congress to serve 
one year of their fiveyear terms in the supreme soviet but there 
is no guarantee when yeltsin will be elected to the practically 
fulltime lawmaking body 
yeltsin has been on the outs politically since losing his job in 
november 1987 following his blunt criticism of the partys style of 
leadership and warnings of a stalinlike cult developing around 
gorbachev 
during his populist campaign against the privileges of the party 
elite and the failure of gorbachevs reforms to put food on the 
tables of ordinary people however yeltsin was careful not to 
challenge gorbachevs leadership he repeated that disclaimer after 
his victory 
i didnt consider myself i dont consider myself and i dont 
want to be an alternative candidate to gorbachev yeltsin told 
hundreds of workers monday at the state construction committee 
where he serves as first deputy chairman 
accused in the communist partys central committee of advocating 
a multiparty system yeltsin has denied the charge and said it was 
an effort to undermine his campaign but he gave a clue about how 
he plans to push his program saying deputies must form interest 
groups if they expect to accomplish anything 
it is impossible to carry out 2250 programs as many as there 
are deputies he said monday yeltsin said he foresaw some 
based on ecology some on social issues some on the economy in 
this way they can be formed to strengthen that trend that voice 
and just the opposite they can stand as a strong barrier 
against those trends that people dont need which hurt our people 
and the government too he said 
yeltsin ran hard in the soviet unions most visible electoral 
district against what he said is an entrenched power structure that 
enjoys special privileges while creating shortages for the masses 
by mismanaging the economy 
he said the leadership has failed to meet its top priority of 
improving living conditions because reforms have not gone far 
enough yeltsin campaigned for eliminating most government 
ministries and cutting the moscow bureaucracy to improve local 
autonomy 
his campaign was built on his popularity gained while serving as 
moscow communist party chief in 198587 it also served as a 
lightning rod for discontent that is surfacing as soviets are 
increasingly allowed to voice their opinions 
yevgeniya tonkonovye 62 said sunday that she voted for yeltsin 
because he visited the clinic where she worked and because he used 
public transportation you feel his earthiness she said 
brakov in contrast came across less naturally and recited a 
campaign program that closely followed mainstream communist party 
calls for improved food and consumer goods 
in his short term as moscow party chief yeltsin was a close 
supporter of gorbachev especially of his calls for greater 
openness but it was gorbachev who criticized his onetime protege 
for being overly ambitious and presided over the meeting at which 
yeltsin was fired 
yeltsin has criticized gorbachevs electoral reforms as not 
being democratic enough and he chastised the party for nominating 
100 candidates for an equal number of seats in the congress 
gorbachev was among the 100 
in contrast threequarters of the 1500 congress members chosen 
sunday had competition 
democracy in society has gotten ahead of democracy in the 
party judging by the election law yeltsin said 
but yeltsins popularity with a program that criticized 
communist party policies could conceivably help gorbachev and the 
soviet leader appeared to acknowledge that in comments he made to 
correspondents after voting sunday 
asked about the charges made against yeltsin in the final days 
of the campaign gorbachev said the former moscow party leader must 
be willing to accept criticism along with everyone else in a freer 
atmosphere 
but he also said those who supported yeltsins attacks on 
bureaucracy were ardent supporters of continuing reforms 
gorbachev might be able to use the strong showing by yeltsin and 
losses suffered by conservatives elsewhere to show the 
conservatives still in the power structure thatay

the astronauts who will fly the 
first space shuttle planetary mission said monday the magellan 
probe they are to launch toward venus next month could teach us 
about more than that hot planet 
not only will we learn much about venus but well learn more 
about earth and why these neighboring planets evolved so 
differently said astronaut norm thagard 
astronaut ronald grabe who will pilot the shuttle atlantis 
noted that magellan will be the first american planetary launch in 
12 years and the first from the shuttle 
the planetary program has been dormant for some time he 
said so magellan will be a very fullfilling flight for us not 
only when we launch it but 15 months later when it orbits venus 
astronaut david walker who will command the flight said the 
magellan flight is a logical marriage between the manned and 
unmanned space programs 
walker and his four atlantis crew members held a news conference 
to discuss the fourday flight scheduled for launch from cape 
canaveral fla on april 28 
six hours after atlantis lifts off astronauts thagard and mark 
lee are to release the magellan spacecraft from the cargo bay an 
hour later a payload rocket motor is to ignite to start the 
8000pound probe on a 466day voyage to venus 
magellan is to reach venus on aug 10 1990 swooping into orbit 
to begin 243 days of mapping the entire surface of the planet with 
highresolution radar 
venus is our closest neighbor in terms of space mass and 
size thagard said planetary science is very important to 
learning how the earth evolved and what is going on here venus is 
another data point we worry about the greenhouse effect here on 
earth magellan could tell us if there are any parallels between 
earth and venus 
although earth and venus were almost identical at the beginning 
of the solar system some 46 billion years ago they evolved very 
differently today venus has a surface temperature of 900 degrees 
and is shrouded in a cloudy atmosphere 
mary cleave a mission specialist on next months mission said 
magellans radar images could show whether venus has shifting 
crustal plates similar to those that sometimes cause earthquakes 
being a civil engineer and interested in the design of 
buildings that could withstand earthquakes i would like to know 
more about plate tectonics she said because there is no water 
on venus the radar can look at the entire planet and this might 
help us understand plate tectonics on earth 
magellan also could answer questions about the extent of 
volcanic activity on venus and whether the planet ever had oceans

the city is getting tough on the pugnacious pit 
bull dog barring the breed from taking up future residence and 
requiring photos and tattoos of those already here 
the board of health adopted a health code amendment monday that 
requires that all pit bull terriers be registered spayed or 
neutered and identified by photographs and tattooing 
the regulations which go into effect in 30 days also require 
that the animals be muzzled whenever there is any potential contact 
with the public that they be on a leash when outside the owners 
home and that signs be posted on the premises indicating the 
presence of a pit bull 
the terriers which were long ago bred to battle bulls for 
sport have been known to turn on humans without warning and bite 
or maul them 
registration of all pit bulls with the city department of health 
must take place before oct 1 and owners must have proof of 
liability insurance of at least 100000 
unregistered pit bulls can be seized and owners face fines of up 
to 500 a day said department spokesman barry adkins 
after october first he said there will be no pit bulls 
allowed into new york city eventually there will come a time 
when there will be no pit bulls in new york city 
adkins said the only figures he had available on deaths from dog 
attacks indicated that from 1983 to august 1987 there were 29 
deaths nationally and 21 of those were caused by pit bulls

crimes motivated by bigotry are more violent than 
previously assumed according to a study released monday by 
northeastern university 
the idea that a civil rights violation consists of kids 
painting graffiti on a church or throwing a rock through a window 
does not describe the type of incidents reported to the boston 
police professor jack mcdevitt wrote in his study for the center 
for applied social research at northeastern university 
more than 50 percent of the incidents of racial violence 
identified in our study are acts of a very serious and potentially 
injuryresulting character 
the study examined 452 crimes reported from 1983 to 1987 and 
identified by the boston police community disorders unit as 
motivated by bigotry 
the crimes included whites assaulting a white boyfriend of a 
black female bricks thrown through windows a swastika painted on 
a synagogue and assaults on homosexuals 
fiftythree percent of the crimes were categorized as physical 
assaults and 47 percent as property damage 
howard j ehrlich research director of the national institute 
against prejudice and violence an independent organization in 
baltimore called the northeastern study the first really decent 
analysis of hard data 
such research reinforces findings of the baltimore institute 
that one out of four or five minority persons will be victimized 
during the course of a year he said 
its very underreported mcdevitt said victims fear 
retaliation and victims will deny its a hate crime if you feel 
youre a victim because of your religion or your color then each 
time you step out the door you fear youre going to be attacked 
among the findings 
sixtythree percent of the racial incidents were perpetrated by 
whites 33 percent by blacks four percent of such offenses were 
committed by people of hispanic or asian origin 
the largest percentage of victims 35 percent were white 
followed by blacks 32 percent vietnamese 12 percent other 
asian 11 percent hispanics including portuguese 7 percent and 
jews 1 percent nearly onethird of the victims were female 
in 30 percent of the cases victims were told they were being 
attacked because they did not belong in a neighborhood 
64 percent of the racial attacks were committed by more than 
one individual and most involved four or more people ganging up 
against a lone victim 
ehrlich said its estimated that up to 70 percent of such 
crimes including verbal assaults are never reported but he said 
society can work to get rid of bigotry 
prejudice is learned what confuses people is that because 
its learned so early they believe its innate or natural 
understanding that its a learned attitude lets us understand that 
we can change attitudes erhlich said

president bush his wife children and 
grandchildren joined thousands of youngsters on the sunlit south 
lawn of the white house monday for an easter egg roll lacking much 
of the commercialization of recent years 
what we were trying to do was basically bring back good kid 
entertainment and take some of the commercial out of it said 
debbie romash of the white house visitors center 
ms romash said white house security estimated nearly 40000 
children and parents came through the gates for this years event 
about 5000 more than last year 
the bushes were accompanied by two of their children neil and 
doro and six grandchildren vice president dan quayle hid wooden 
eggs in straw for younger children and his wife marilyn and 
10yearold daughter corinne read stories 
nancy sununu wife of white house chief of staff john sununu 
also joined the story readers 
actor christopher reeve and his two sons alexander and matthew 
joined the first family at the egg roll as did actors playing 
little red riding hood and the wolf from the broadway show into 
the woods 
the president squatted down to explain to 2yearold 
granddaughter ellie leblond how to use a plastic kitchen spoon to 
roll a hardboiled egg 20 or so feet down a lane drawn on the white 
house lawn for the occasion 
then he blew a whistle to start the round 
eggrolling is a technique that may have fallen into disuse 
since 1878 when the children of washington persuaded president 
rutherford b hayes to allow them to compete at the white house 
after they had been banned from the grounds of the capitol 
the eggs are to stay rolling through the lush grass for the 
distance but some of the older children the top age allowed is 8 
sailed their eggs across the finish line with one flick at the 
whistle some of the littlest competitors needed help from a parent 
no one seemed to be keeping track of who won the events but it 
didnt matter because all the participants in the white house egg 
rolls win a souvenir wooden egg this year they bore the signatures 
of the first couple 
bush talked with reeve bystanders and others then blew the 
whistle for a second race at its conclusion he headed back to the 
white house shaking hands along the way 
our goals this year were to one accentuate the family 
because that is so much of the bushes and two increase the 
involvement of the kids in the basic activities that they come 
for ms romash said 
a family easter at the white house 1989 said the brochure 
and sticker given each child upon arrival afterward each was 
given a single easter card with a story about the easter bunny not 
the bags of candy and other goodies of recent years 
gone were the actors dressed up as tv cartoon characters or 
wellknown brands of candy that were a feature of the event during 
the years ronald reagan lived in the white house 
instead clowns some volunteers from the ringling bros and 
barnum amp bailey circus made up the bulk of the costumed 
entertainers who mingled with the little ones this year 
distributing heliumfilled balloons of pink yellow or white and 
signing autographs 
it was a day with much standing in line for most guests an 
average of two hours just to get in plus additional waits to 
participate in the most popular events

a rare holstein calf born without hair has 
survived its first month by wearing flannel shirts and leg wraps 
but it now faces the risk of fatal sunburn as summer approaches 
the local vet has been here a couple of times to look at him 
and he said hes seen calves with two heads or five legs but hes 
never had to deal with one that doesnt have any hair said 
virgil hoheisel the owner of baldy 
except for a small patch of fur on its hind quarters and two 
wispy tufts on its forehead the hillman farmers cow is as bald as 
a cue ball it doesnt even have eyelashes 
when it was born he reminded me of one of those little baby 
mice without any hair said hoheisels wife mary lou 
raising a hairless calf has posed some unusual problems baldy 
eats considerably more than most calves his age yet he stays 
surprisingly svelte almost all of his food energy is consumed in 
keeping warm and not much is left for growing the hoheisels said 
to warm baldy the owners have outfitted him in old flannel 
shirts and because he bruises and cuts easily mrs hoheisel has 
fitted him with leg wraps 
francis spurrell a doctor who specializes in animal 
reproduction or theriogenology at the university of minnesotas 
college of veterinary medicine said baldy likely is showing signs 
of hypotrichosiscongenita an extremely rare genetic mutation 
most calves like this die shortly after birth so a calf 
living even this long is highly unusual spurrell said 
baldys longterm prognosis will not improve much as summer 
approaches spurrell said the animals weight may increase but 
because of the lack of hair the calf will be highly susceptible to 
severe sunburn and accompanying infection spurrell said he doubts 
that baldy could gradually adapt to longer exposure to the sun the 
way people do by becoming tan 
as long as hes healthy and not suffering were in no rush to 
get rid of him hoheisel said being as rare as he is hes 
kind of nice to have around

prime minister margaret thatcher of 
britain said monday that the need to resolve the middle east crisis 
has never been more urgent and suggested that israel consider 
talking to its opponents 
she addressed a banquet given by morrocan king hassan ii at the 
start of an african tour that also will take her to nigeria 
zimbabwe and malawi 
mrs thatcher noted hassans 1986 meeting with thenisraeli 
premier shimon peres which drew fire from some other arab nations 
nothing is ever lost by exploring the views of ones 
opponents she said that is an example from which israel can 
learn 
the remark appeared to be another suggestion that israel meet 
with the palestine liberation organization 
british foreign office minister william waldegrave said on a 
visit to israel last month that israeli leaders should accept the 
plo as a negotiating partner waldegrave met in january with plo 
chief yasser arafat 
israel considers the plo a terrorist organization despite 
arafats renunciation of terrorism in december and his recognition 
of israels right to exist a move that opened the way for the 
usplo dialogue now in progress 
never has the need for a solution to the arabisraeli 
conflict been more urgent mrs thatcher told the royal banquet 
the proliferation of weapons including chemical weapons and the 
ballistic missiles to deliver them brings home to us the horrors 
of a further conflict 
no one should be in doubt that the present situation in the 
middle east is fundamentally unstable and cannot continue 
she said an international conference would provide the right 
framework for negotiations 
successful negotiations must include the direct involvement of 
representatives of the palestinian people from inside and outside 
the occupied territories she said as well as us influence 
with israel and support of the permanent members of the un 
security council 
the united states the soviet union china britain and france 
comprise the five permanent members 
mrs thatcher said she would like to see britain and morocco 
make a cooperative effort to bring the israelis and palestinians 
together 
her talks with hassan were to focus on the mideast 
britishmoroccan ties and moroccan relations with the european 
economic community 
in an interview with the official moroccan news agency map mrs 
thatcher expressed her assent with moroccos wish for strengthened 
economic ties with the eec morocco has vainly sought entry into 
the trading bloc 
greeted at the raindrenched airport by premier azzedine laraki 
mrs thatcher was ceremonially offered a bowl of milk and dates 
upon her arrival monday before attending a luncheon given by 
hassans wife and three daughters 
the british prime ministers aides said before her departure 
that she would launch a southern african peace initiative during 
her oneweek trip 
she said in a radio interview broadcast on saturday however 
that she could not go to south africa until nelson mandela jailed 
leader of the african national congress is released

a massive mudslide closed the main road 
to cedar breaks national monument and stripped off a halfmile 
section of pavement and it continued to ooze downhill monday 
authorities said 
the slide roughly half a mile long and half a mile wide sent 
mud and boulders cascading across state road 14 sometime during the 
night and was discovered monday morning said utah department of 
transportation spokesman kim morris 
no injuries were reported the highway had been heavily traveled 
during the easter weekend the utah highway patrol said 
no one was stranded at the monument because other roads lead 
from the monument back to main roads 
the slide pushed an unoccupied road grader off the road morris 
said it also blocked a section of coal creek which runs through 
the canyon eight miles east of cedar city but no serious flooding 
was reported 
the slide continued to move but did not appear to be a threat 
the movement was barely perceptible to the eye said jeff 
tippetts communications supervisor for the utah highway patrol 
office in cedar city 
state road crews expected to open a detour around the slide area 
tuesday after plowing snow from two sections of rural roads that 
been closed through the winter morris said 
the area received heavy rain and snow during the weekend said 
meteorologist bill alder at the national weather service in salt 
lake city 
it wasnt immediately known if the precipitation triggered the 
slide but alder said thats probably what loosened the soil 
a weather gauge at nearby navajo lake reported 10 inches of 
snow while zion national park 15 miles to the south reported 
054 of an inch of rain alder said 
cedar breaks is a natural amphitheater a halfmile deep and two 
miles wide with cliffs eroded into pinnacles and ridges in a 
variety of colors it was named by mormon pioneers who called its 
rugged topography breaks and mistook its juniper trees for 
cedars

boris n yeltsin and other antiestablishment 
candidates rode a wave of popular discontent to victory in 
parliamentary elections that gave soviet voters their first real 
choice according to returns monday 
communist party chiefs in the nations second and thirdlargest 
cities were defeated in sundays voting and a top member of the 
soviet leadership apparently was rejected in his home district 
where he ran unopposed 
results trickling in from across the country indicated soviets 
took advantage of new electoral freedom to express their 
dissatisfaction with shortages of food and consumer goods rising 
prices the bureaucracy and officials who promise reform 
the winners will join those picked earlier by the communist 
party and other organizations in a new 2250member congress of 
peoples deputies the parliament is still certain to be dominated 
by the ruling party and an entrenched kremlin leadership that 
assured itself of seats without having to face opposition at the 
polls 
yeltsin the burly 58yearold former moscow party boss won a 
landslide victory after a populist campaign against the special 
privileges afforded the party elite at a time when most people can 
find practically nothing in their stores 
the onetime gorbachev protege amassed 894 percent of the vote 
against yevgeny brakov a factory director in a race for a seat to 
represent all of moscow according to igor n orlov chairman of 
moscows election commission 
brakov 51 who also campaigned for improvements in the food 
supply but whose factory makes the zil limousines that symbolize 
privilege received just 69 percent of the vote orlov said 
yeltsins win marked a stunning political comeback following his 
dramatic fall from grace in 1987 when he was ousted as moscow 
party chief and later fired as a nonvoting member of the ruling 
politburo he was accused of political mistakes and personal 
ambition after he criticized his fellow leaders and complained that 
perestroika gorbachevs reform program had not fulfilled the 
peoples needs 
its hard to say what my spirit is more full of joy or 
concern about what i realistically can do to help muscovites 
yeltsin told hundreds of workers at the state construction 
committee where he still holds ministerial rank despite his ouster 
from the partys top ranks the workers applauded warmly 
but yeltsins victory carries little power the congress to 
which he was elected will meet just once a year to elect a 
president and a fraction of its own membership to a fulltime 
legislature the supreme soviet gorbachev has said he wants all 
members of the congress to serve one year of their fiveyear terms 
in the supreme soviet but there is no guarantee when yeltsin will 
move up to the lawmaking body 
the congress will be made up of 1500 deputies elected in 
sundays territorial balloting and 750 members chosen earlier by 
various party social and professional organizations 
elsewhere other longtime office holders who traditionally won 
in uncontested elections went down to defeat 
leningrad communist party chief anatoly gerasimov lost 
overwhelmingly to a shipbuilder who took 74 percent of the vote in 
the nations secondlargest city tass said 
in an apparent defeat for a politburo member the name of 
leningrad regional party chief yuri f solovyov was omitted from a 
tass list of victorious parliamentary candidates local journalists 
said solovyov one of eight nonvoting members of the 20man 
politburo had no opponent in the parliamentary race but voters 
had the choice of voting against any candidate by crossing out the 
name on the ballot 
another loser was konstantin masik regional party chief in 
kiev the soviet unions thirdlargest city and capital of the 
ukraine tass said party leaders in four other areas of the 
ukraine also lost tass said 
in the baltic republics candidates from grassroots movements 
that have tapped popular dissatisfaction with moscows control over 
their economies cultures and politics generally fared well in the 
election 
in estonia edgar savisaar a founder of the peoples front won 
more than 80 percent of the vote in defeating a local communist 
party chief another estonian peoples front leader marju 
lauristen also received more than 80 percent to defeat the editor 
of a russianlanguage newspaper 
lithuanias president vitautas astrauskas and its premier 
vitautas sakalauskas were defeated sajudis the lithuanian 
grassroots movement claimed all 39 of its candidates either won or 
advanced to runoff elections 
latvias premier vilnis bresis was defeated by a popular 
television reporter and the republics party chief janis vagris 
was elected a deputy by a only small margin after a complicated 
preelection battle tass said 
in other moscow races 
reformminded economist oleg t bogomolov defeated a factory 
worker and a regional party official 
roy a medvedev a historian ousted from the party for 
writings that went against the official grain before gorbachev came 
to power faces a runoff against a woman who runs an atomic energy 
laboratory 
ilya i zaslavsky a young activist who campaigned for rights 
for the handicapped beat a tv commentator in a race in gorbachevs 
home district in moscow 
of 26 territorial election district races in moscow runoffs are 
planned in eight districts where no candidate won a majority of the 
votes tass said election officials said the runoffs would be held 
april 9 
in washington state department spokeswoman margaret tutwiler 
praised the soviet elections as a move in the right direction 
she said that although the elections were neither free nor 
democratic by western standards they do represent a change from 
past practices 
nationwide figures on turnout were not available but orlov said 
835 percent of moscows 69 million eligible voters took part 
that represents a drop from the 999 percent turnout usually 
reported in soviet elections in which volunteers go into 
neighborhoods to force people to vote 
yeltsin had expressed fears that ruling party officials would 
steal the election after the polls closed by stuffing ballot boxes 
or throwing out opposition votes but no complaints of fraud 
surfaced monday

ridgeway his wife betty and 25yearold daughter robin were 
camping in a remote imperial county area near the usmexico 
border when they finally were located early sunday by matt 
ridgeway and los angelesbased knxam news radio helicopter pilot 
bob tur 
hes very thankful especially to bob tur and his 
helicopter matt said 
charles ridgeway an accounting manager at rockwell 
international in anaheim wore a paging device so hospital 
officials could locate him but he was well out of its range 
because ridgeways blood type is shared by only 15 percent of 
the population doctors said it could be years before a kidney 
became available the son said it was just a fluke one with 
the right blood type became available so quickly 
matt drove 100 mph to the imperial valley while 
searchandrescue crews also looked and tur flew through driving 
rain in his search they initially were unable to find the elder 
ridgeway among easter weekend crowds of campers 
it was like looking for a needle in a sand dune tur said 
it was a pretty close call mainly because the helicopter was 
running out of fuel the younger ridgeway said they tur and 
others with him had 10 minutes left before they would have had to 
turn around and go back 
ridgeway required the transplant because he suffered polycystic 
kidney failure in which cysts form in the kidney and prevent its 
proper functioning ayala said the condition is genetic matt 
ridgeway said 
he said the donated kidney came from a local teenage girl 
ayala said she had no details on the donor

iran planned to release a yacht that was 
seized by irans revolutionary guards with four britons and members 
of the kuwaiti royal family on board sources said monday 
details of the incident remained sketchy in the face of 
government denials and sources could not confirm whether the yacht 
and its passengers were still in iranian hands 
but iranian diplomats in the southern gulf port of dubai were 
discreetly spreading word that the yacht would not be held said a 
diplomatic source in dubai who spoke on condition of anonymity 
earlier reports said the ship was seized thursday near the 
revolutionary guard stronghold of farsi island with five members 
of kuwaits ruling sabah family and four young british women on 
board one report said they were airline stewardesses there was no 
confirmation monday of who was on board 
this seems to be nothing more than the usual practice of the 
iranian revolutionary guards said a kuwaitbased diplomat 
speaking on condition of anonymity there does not appear to be 
anything political behind this incident it just seems to be an 
exercise in piracy 
the guards using speedboats with guns mounted on board roamed 
the gulf shipping lanes and attacked vessels during the eightyear 
iraniraq war which was halted in august by a ceasefire 
a ranking iranian diplomat has confirmed that the yacht was 
seized when it strayed in iranian waters said the diplomatic 
source in dubai he also said the iranian confirmed an imminent 
release 
the sources said iran did not want to jeopardize the friendly 
ties it has been developing with kuwait since the ceasefire and 
that the affair would end quietly iran has not commented publicly 
on the reports 
the diplomats said the occupants of the yacht may have been 
released by monday but that sandstorms and rough seas were keeping 
the ship in iranian waters 
kuwaits government apparently leaked the story to the respected 
daily newspaper alanbaa to pressure iran for a release the 
newspaper first reported details of the seizure on sunday 
the governments of kuwait bahrain and britain denied all 
reports involving the incident 
the diplomats speculated that the identity of the passengers 
would never be released especially if members of the royal family 
were involved the 82foot yachts name the falaika is the same 
as a resort island off kuwait and indicated that it came from the 
wealthy emirate 
if britons were on board they might not have been missed 
because they did not bother to register with the local embassy the 
diplomats said 
by the time everything has firmed up it will probably be 
referred to as a case of a small motorboat getting lost and 
released with no one of significance aboard said one source

a detained black activist ended a 
38day hunger strike monday drinking milk and eating two slices of 
toast to end the longest of a wave of fasts protesting detention 
without trial 
sandile thusi said he would consider resuming the hunger strike 
if law and order minister adriaan vlok refused to free him 
im just giving mr vlok a chance a few days so he can think 
about my release thusi 26 said from his bed at st aidans 
hospital in durban where he was visited by his mother aunt and 
sisterinlaw 
thusi lost about 57 pounds onethird of his normal weight in 
the hunger strike and doctors had said he risked brain damage and 
blindness if he did not resume eating immediately he was fasting 
to protest his ninemonth detention without trial 
the law and order ministry said last week that thusis release 
would not be considered while he continued his fast there has been 
no response from the ministry to his decision to resume eating 
thusi said he would suspend the fast after a meeting saturday 
with the rev frank chikane a prominent antiapartheid leader 
chikane also spoke saturday to vlok about thusi who has staged 
the longest fast of the estimated 600 detainees participating in 
hunger strikes since january to demand their freedom 
thusi a university researcheundations and 
contributions from 100000 members has 40 staff lawyers 
i guess we would have more than effective legal counsel in any 
litigation said meyerhoff who is a lawyer 
unless there was some showing of bad faith or malice here on 
our part the law is clear that a lawsuit like that could be 
successfully defended he said adding such a lawsuit could be 
considered frivolous by the courts 
the nrdc report on pesticide residues in childrens food was 
released in late february and concluded that eating apples treated 
with the growth regulator alar increased cancer risk in children 
the report has been widely disputed and the federal government 
has said apples are safe to eat the industry has accused the nrdc 
of unfairness because only 5 percent of the crop is treated with 
alar alar is the trade name for daminozide and is still legal to 
use 
nevertheless the report caused an uproar prompting some school 
districts to temporarily ban apples hurting exports and retail 
sales 
the exact economic impact has not yet been measured but prices 
for the top grade of red apples have dropped about 2 per box in 
recent weeks and apple shipments from washington dropped by over 
300000 boxes in the past two weeks 
warehouses in washington which produces half the nations 
supermarket apples still have 177 million boxes of red apples 
from the fall harvest in storage 
multiplying that by 2 per 42pound box produces an economic 
loss of 354 million for the rest of the season even if prices 
drop no further 
the basic problem in the industry now is theyve nrdc 
smeared the red apple so bad on the alar thing that its rolling 
over into the nonalartreated fruit mcpherson said 
everytime a housewife sees red apples she could be seeing red 
herself he said i dont know how you can measure that

the commerce department said monday it had 
made a final determination that imports of antifriction bearings 
from nine countries are being sold in the united states at less 
than fair value 
the departments ruling covered imports from west germany 
france italy japan romania singapore sweden thailand and the 
united kingdom the agency also ruled that bearings from singapore 
and thailand were being subsidized 
as a result of earlier preliminary rulings in the case cash 
deposits or bonds are being imposed on imports from the nine 
countries to offset the price advantages and subsidies 
if the us international trade commission makes a final ruling 
that the lowpriced imports harm us industry the commerce 
department will instruct the customs service to collect the final 
antidumping and countervailing duties 
the department began its investigation after the torrington co 
in torrington conn filed a petition last march on behalf of the 
us bearing industry alleging that massive dumping by the foreign 
countries was damaging the domestic bearing industry torrington is 
the nations largest producer of a range of bearings 
david gridley the companys industry marketing manager said 
several studies had found that a substantial number of bearing 
factories closed and workers were laid off while at the same time 
imports from these foreign countries have been increasing 
gridley said the company was very pleased with the ruling and 
with the departments indepth inquiry the petition resulted in 34 
antidumping and 10 countervailing duty investigations covering 
several kinds of bearings 
the department said the investigations were the most technical 
and complex in several years and covered more than 25 foreign 
companies 
imports of antifriction bearings from the nine countries were 
estimated at about 650 million in 1988 antifriction bearings are 
used in the aircraft automotive machinery and electronics 
industries

christian army gunners exchanged 
artillery fire with druse militiamen and syrian soldiers monday in 
a battle that began nearly three weeks ago and has killed or 
wounded hundreds of civilians 
an arab league mediation committee appealed for a ceasefire 
police reported sporadic rocket and howitzer barrages during the 
day and said the fire intensified just before sundown they said 
the syrians and druse launched hundreds of rockets into into 
residential districts of christian east beirut and the christian 
enclave north and east of the capital 
dozens of rockets were directed at the defense ministry in 
suburban yarze headquarters of gen michel aoun who commands the 
20000 christians of the lebanese army and the presidential palace 
in nearby baabda where aoun lives 
his gunners used 155mm howitzers to shell syrian and druse 
positions in the mountains overlooking beirut police said 
they reported two civilians were killed and seven wounded in 
east beirut and four wounded in drusecontrolled villages 
southeast of beirut but they had no word on casualties among 
combatants the toll since fighting began march 8 stood at 99 dead 
and 350 wounded by police count 
the worst sectarian fighting since 1985 in lebanons 14yearold 
civil war began two days after aouns men blockaded illegal ports 
run by moslem militias which deprive the five government ports of 
an estimated 100 million a year in taxes 
a political crisis that arose in september has created christian 
and moslem governments and divided the army on sectarian lines 
premier salim hoss leads the moslem cabinet and maj gen sami 
khatib commands the 22000 moslem soldiers 
citizens on both sides of the sectarian line that divides 
beirut who have been living in bomb shelters took advantage of 
the comparative daytime lull to replenish food and other 
necessities 
it seems our hibernation is going to last for a long 
time said george khoury a christian from the mansourieh 
district i have bought some mattresses because we cannot go on 
sleeping on the hard floor some games for the children and 
tranquilizers for our fraying nerves 
random shelling overnight sometimes reached 60 rounds a minute 
and the main power plant was set ablaze electricity was rationed 
to four hours monday 
arab league mediators sent appeals for a truce from league 
headquarters in tunis to president hafez assad of syria and the 
lebanese belligerents beirut radio stations reported 
assad keeps 40000 soldiers in lebanon under a 1976 peacekeeping 
mandate from the arab league and has become the countrys main 
power broker during the long civil war 
sheik sabah ahmed sabah kuwaits foreign minister leads the 
sixmember committee the mediators appointed in january 
scheduled meetings in the tunisian capital with two former 
presidents of lebanon and four of its former premiers 
hoss told a news conference monday he had sent a new note to the 
league blaming the fighting on aouns lust for power aoun has 
made no secret of his hopes to become president 
president amin gemayel named aoun to lead an interim government 
sept 22 when parliament could not agree on a successor at the end 
of gemayels sixyear term moslems supported by syria swore 
allegiance to hoss the incumbent sunni moslem premier and two 
governments resulted 
under an unwritten agreement dating to independence from france 
in 1943 the president is a christian the premier a sunni and the 
parliament speaker a shiite moslem 
aoun says the syrians have become an occupation force by taking 
sides and has declared a war of liberation to drive them out 
hoss contends the syrian military presence is legitimate 
the syrian army entered lebanon in 1976 at the request of the 
lebanese government he told reporters this request was 
later endorsed by the arab league of which lebanon is a founding 
member 
any demand for syrian withdrawal should come from a united 
government which is not present at the moment he said and 
accused aoun of pushing lebanon to the brink of disaster

prime minister yitzhak shamir will propose 
elections in the occupied lands as a step toward beginning peace 
talks with palestinians while avoiding direct contact with the plo 
a senior official said monday 
shamir who is bringing his peace plan to washington next week 
is being pressed by the united states european countries and 
opponents in his own government to find a way to end the 
palestinian uprising in the west bank and gaza strip 
also monday an israeli policeman caught alone in a west bank 
village opened fire monday on young arabs who pelted him with 
stones killing a 4yearold boy the army reported 
arab hospital officials said amjad ahmed hassan died of a chest 
wound the death toll since the uprising began in the occupied 
territories more than 15 months ago now stands at 412 palestinians 
and 18 israelis 
a military spokesman said the policeman who came under 
stonethrowing attack in beit kad a remote west bank village and 
was forced to use his weapon he did not say why the policeman 
was there 
israeli policemen are assigned to the occupied territories only 
for investigative duties and the army handles patrols the military 
command said police and the army were investigating the shooting 
the senior official speaking on condition of anonymity said 
shamirs plan calls for the 17 million palestinians in the 
occupied lands to choose local leaders in the next few months who 
can negotiate an interim peace agreement 
but shamir said his proposal would not lead to an independent 
palestinian state 
in the land of israel there can be just one country the state 
of israel shamir said monday at a gathering of senior members of 
his rightwing likud bloc in tel aviv 
in the coming days im going on a mission for the country 
im confident because i know the majority of the country is behind 
me shamir said of his trip to the united states 
the official said shamirs vision of the temporary settlement 
resembles the fiveyear period of palestinian autonomy outlined in 
the ussponsored camp david accords that led to the 1979 peace 
treaty with egypt 
the main idea is elections as part of an interim settlement 
but the type and extent of the elections whether they would be 
mayors or local leaders or representatives will be left open to 
negotiation the official said 
other reports have said shamir might propose administering the 
west bank and gaza with neighboring jordan as part of a 
confederation israel captured the west bank from jordan and gaza 
from egypt in the 1967 middle east war 
defense minister yitzhak rabin who proposed several months ago 
that elections be held told high school pupils near tel aviv on 
monday his centerleft labor party and shamirs conservative likud 
bloc must cooperate on a peace plan 
we can of course gore each other the two main blocs but 
lets put aside differences and seek the area where we can move the 
peace process forward in a joint cooperative way among us he 
said 
labor led by finance minister shimon peres and likud formed a 
national unity coalition after indecisive elections in november 
shamir refuses contact with the palestine liberation 
organization which he says is a terrorist group and objected when 
the united states opened contacts after plo chairman yasser arafat 
renounced terrorism in december 
holding elections which shamir initially rejected is seen here 
as a compromise 
i am convinced that in any peace agreement both sides have to 
overcome many obstacles and also make concessions shamir said 
sunday on israel television sunday 
according to the senior official the bush administration is 
trying to persuade the plo to accept the proposal for palestinians 
not officially linked to it to open talks with israel but the plo 
insists on entering the talks later 
he said shamirs government rejects that condition as well as 
demands that israel accept the principle of trading land for peace 
meanwhile leaders of the rebellion urged palestinians to 
intensify it with knives axes firebombs and large rocks 
in leaflet no 37 issued monday the unified national 
leadership of the uprising also demanded that palestinians boycott 
meetings with israeli officials to frustrate shamirs effort to 
find nonplo partners for peace talks 
a general strike monday virtually shut the territories down 
arab reports said 11 palestinians suffered gunshot wounds in six 
stonethrowing encounters with israeli troops 
soldiers confined more than 260000 gaza residents to their 
homes with curfews on eight towns and refugee camps

randall dale adams jailed for more than 
12 years for a murder he says he didnt commit and freed partly 
because of the movie thin blue line said monday he hopes to 
build a future by speaking about his ordeal 
this is a case and a story that must be held before the 
public randall dale adams said in an inteview at his mothers 
home i want to get some speaking engagements talk to people 
law schools places where lawyers and judges are trained they must 
know my story 
if i can support myself and do that i want to take that 
avenue but failing that ill get a job in that case randall 
adams could just filter into the mists of time 
in the meantime adams a quiet introspective man with a dry 
wit is enjoying his newfound freedom and trying to find some 
private time 
adams 40 was freed last week from a texas prison he had 
inhabited since being convicted in 1977 for the murder of a dallas 
policeman he was sentenced to die 
he was released tuesday after the texas court of criminal 
appeals reversed the conviction on thursday prosecutors announced 
they would not seek to retry him 
adams story was chronicled in filmmaker errol morris 
documentary thin blue line which questioned evidence and 
prompted texas officials to reexamine the case 
adams spent thursday night with his mother mildred who sold 
her house in suburban grove city to help pay her sons legal bills 
after taking a short drive friday around columbus which has 
doubled in size since he last saw it he spent the rest of the day 
with his family in grove city 
he spent most of saturday and part of easter sunday shopping for 
clothes and other necessities on sunday morning adams attended an 
easter church service 
randy took a flower out of his lapel and gave it to the 
pastor said mrs adams then the whole church clapped that 
whole church was just so glad to see that boy 
he tried to rent a videotape of thin blue line but was told 
it was not in stock 
the guy there said i shouldnt rent it because all they do in 
it is talk he said smiling 
adams had other errands to run monday including applying for a 
drivers license and a social security number he also went to rent 
a post office box to accommodate the stream of letters and gifts 
for him 
ive been given just about everything you can think of an 
easter bunny flowers this watch he said 
but adams was calm in the face of the publicity storm his 
release created he said the family has agreed to put its private 
homecoming on hold for now 
were trying to snatch as much private time as possible my 
family understands he said adding that his mother has become 
almost as much a celebrity as he has im afraid im going to 
have to get her an agent 
he said he tries not to think about the time he spent in prison 
which he said is as bad and worse than any movie youve ever 
seen i carry the scars 
his face filled with pain and he spoke slowly when he recalled 
his brush with death in 1980 three days before his execution date 
a stay was issued 
a judge calls you in and tells you you have 30 days then you 
return to your cell and you have 29 days and then you have 20 days 
and then you have 10 days and you know next week you may have 
nothing he said you make peace with yourself 
you must know the man that is inside you i liked the man i 
saw there but i wonder if i could have been man enough to walk 
to my death as a man

opposition leader kim daejung said 
monday that ultrarightists in the government and military oppose 
democratic reforms and are attempting to bring about a catstrophe 
by any means 
they fear losing their hold on power and feel as if their 
throats are being choked by demcoratic reforms he said in an 
address to the foreign press club 
kim also said he is opposed to a referendum on president roh 
taewoos administration and that he favors the presence of 
american troops in south korea until peace can be secured with 
communist north korea 
in other developments 
police detained 23 dissidents who tried to reach the north 
korean border for a reunification meeting with communist delegates 
at panmunjom the truce site established in the demilitarized zone 
under the ceasefire that ended the korean war in 1953 the 
dissidents had defied a government order barring south koreans from 
going to the meeting 
government prosecutors said that a dissident leader the 
revmoon ikhwan would be arrested if he returns to seoul from an 
unauthorized visit to north korea 
they said moon would face prosecution under national security 
laws and if convicted could be sentenced to up to 10 years in 
prison 
moon arrived saturday in pyongyang the north korean capital 
after a trip to japan and china south korean officials denounced 
moon for a speech he made in pyongyang in which he called north 
korean leader kim il sung a respectable president 
roh announced on march 20 that he was indefinitely postponing 
the planned midterm referendum on his governments performance but 
kim daejung urged the president not to hold such an election 
he said a referendum could plunge the nation into chaos and 
allow extreme rightists to seize control 
roh has said he postponed the referendum because radical 
leftists were plotting a revolution 
kim daejung leader of the party for peace and democracy said 
it would be premature to conduct a refereundum because roh has not 
carried out all of the democratic reforms he promised during the 
election campaign 
our goal is not to expel him roh but to complete work for 
true democracy he added 
some observers believe kim daejung does not want a referendum 
because polls show he is trailing rival opposition leader kim 
youngsam 
they said if the people voted against rohs administration it 
could have forced an election and kim youngsam had the best chance 
of winning 
roh a former general won the election in december 1987 after 
kim daejung and kim youngsam split the opposition vote 
kim daejung rejected the antiamericanism of many radical 
groups that are demanding the withdrawal of the 43000 us 
military personnel based in south korea 
he said he favored amerian troops remaining here until a 
permanent peace with north korea is assured

fishermen who warned years ago that an 
oil spill could wreak havoc with prince william sounds pristine 
environment say their worst fears have been realized 
its a heck of a way to win an argument said fisherman 
knute johnson 62 who opposed the 1977 construction of an oil 
terminal in valdez the nations northernmost icefree port 
johnson joined a group of fishermen who testified in the 1970s 
before a congressional committee considering construction of the 
transalaska oil pipeline and the oil terminal 
we were concerned about what biological damages could be 
johnson said monday we were concerned about tankers piling up on 
reefs 
the oil companies ignored us he said all they said was 
that the latest technology would be used they said not to worry 
about a spill because it would never happen now its happened 
the tanker exxon valdez ran aground early friday on a charted 
reef as it maneuvered around floating ice 25 miles south of valdez 
cleanup of the 101 milliongallon spill the largest in us 
history was proceeding slowly monday as high winds and currents 
spread the oil over more than 100 square miles 
a 12 million herringroe fishery expected to open in early 
april may be ruined while other fisheries may suffer this summer 
and for years to come said marilyn leland executive director for 
the cordova district fishermen united some fishermen could go 
broke waiting for other fisheries to open she said 
last year fishermen on prince william sound caught 131 million 
in salmon herring halibut and shellfish 
even if this years catch is good marketing the fish could be 
difficult said sandra cesarini coowner of a valdez 
fishprocessing company people are concerned whether the fish 
will be edible she said 
charter boat operations and other businesses dependent on 
tourism say the spill is tarnishing the pristine image of the 
islanddotted sound which is surrounded by glaciertopped 
mountains and filled with whales bald eagles porpoises and other 
wildlife 
leland said one of the hardesthit towns may be cordova 30 
miles east of the spill the towns population swells to 6000 
residents during fishing season 
everybody is here because of fishing in cordova leland 
said we can be looking at a devastating loss 
up to 50 fishermen offered their boats for the messy job of 
pulling containment booms around fingers of the oil spill but by 
monday only four boats had been used 
cesarini said she already is losing money because of the spill 
a boat en route to the cannery with 14000 pounds of scallops had 
to be diverted because the spill closed the port of valdez 
were talking about 1 million lost income right this 
second with more losses likely to follow she said were 
pretty outraged this was to have been our best year 
fishermen met sunday with exxon officials to discuss claims for 
compensation for immediate losses as well as losses expected from 
damage to the marine environment during the next 20 years the 
company said it will operate claims offices in valdez and cordvoa 
the spill may affect dozens of charter boats cruise ships and 
staterun ferries that cater to the summer tourist trade in 
valdez population 3100 motels and restaurants are packed now 
with oil spill workers government officials and journalists but 
the boom soon may give way to a bust 
i wouldnt expect people in iowa will want to see beautfiful 
prince william sound with oil floating in it leland said 
its a negative well probably live with all summer long 
said bob scott owner of alaska glacier tours in anchorage which 
coordinates cruises in prince william sound any time something 
negative happens thats what people remember they dont remember 
that its cleaned up

reported killed and at least eight people wounded 
staterun media said violence spread to at least seven kosovo 
towns in the fifth straight day of protests of constitutional 
changes that would reduce autonomy in the southern province

tanjug news agency said and gunfire was reported in at least three 
others

people died in ethnic riots in the province 
the protests began thursday when kosovos parliament approved 
constitutional amendments giving leaders from the mainly christian 
republic of serbia more power in kosovo serbia is the largest of 
the countrys six republics 
serbias provinces of kosovo and vojvodina have enjoyed 
considerable autonomy since 1974 but serbian leaders said they

serbian minority from the mainly moslem ethnic albanian majority 
which makes up 85 percent of the vote

in kosovo since thursday seventyeight of them have been sentenced

in jail monday for defying compulsory orders to work and end 
protest strikes at two kosovo mines tanjug said 
a partial state of emergency was imposed on the province last 
month because of the strikes 
the ethnic unrest in kosovo has deepened divisions in 
yugoslavias communist leadership with leaders in the more liberal 
northern republics of croatia and slovenia opposing serbias drive 
for more control over kosovo 
the belgrade daily borba reported monday that an unsigned appeal 
to the human rights organization amnesty international was 
published in slovenia protesting the arrests of ethnic albanians 
among those detained is azem vlasi a former communist party 
leader in kosovo who is accused of fomenting strikes by ethnic 
albanian workers last month he is the first party man detained on 
political grounds in yugoslavia since the 1950s 
kosovo is yugoslavias poorest region with 30 percent 
unemployment twice the national average 
ethnic tension throughout the country has been exacerbated by 
the long political and economic crisis with annual inflation 
expected to hit 400 percent in april

the government released contradictory 
findings in the 1984 assassination of premier indira gandhi monday 
one implicating her personal secretary and expressing the suspicion 
that he was linked to the cia 
a memorandum accompanying this report exonerated the secretary 
said home minister buta singh in releasing the report to parliament 
singh disclosed at the same time that separate investigations 
that did not figure in the report unraveled a conspiracy a 
larger conspiracy to eliminate mrs gandhiand that more arrests 
were expected shortly 
two sikh bodyguards shot and killed mrs gandhi on oct 31 
1984 as she walked through the garden of her new delhi residence 
to a television interview her son rajiv replaced her as prime 
minister 
a report by an investigative commission under supreme court 
justice mp thakkar was completed nearly three years ago but was 
kept secret on national security grounds this inquiry ran parallel 
to an inquiry of police experts called the special investigating 
team 
the 314page thakkar report implicated rajendra kumar dhawan 
mrs gandhis secretary for more than 20 years and also said 
security officials were aware of the threat to mrs gandhis life 
and could have prevented the murder 
a memorandum accompanying the report said the allegations were 
checked out by the special investigating team appointed by the 
government to lay charges against those involved and it found 
dhawan had no hand in the conspiracy 
singh told parliament the team completed its work in january and 
added that charges will be filed soon against others involved in 
the conspiracy 
the thakkar report links only three people directly to the 
assassination the two known gunmen and dhawan 
dhawan 52 left government after the assassination but 
returned last month as an adviser to rajiv gandhi dhawan could not 
be reached at his home or office for comment but the government 
has said he is innocent 
according to the thakkar report mrs gandhi reprimanded dhawan 
a month before her death and made inquiries about replacing him 
it accused dhawan of facilitating the murder by countermanding 
an order to remove all sikhs from the inner security circle 
approving shift changes for one assassin and keeping secret 
instructions about mrs gandhis security that indicated he was 
snooping or spying on the late prime minister and was active as an 
informant for someone 
the report said dhawan was walking with mrs gandhi to the 
interview but fell back just before the shooting started 
it appears that he has been making a deliberate effort to 
emphasize that he had not noticed beant singh taking out his 
revolver from his hip pocket the report said 
it said dhawan lied or gave inadequate reponses to questions 
about entries in his diary about one assassin foreign money the 
cia and his association with a sikh suspected of having ties to the 
us intelligence agency which gives rise to a suspicion as to 
whether dhawan had some links with the cia 
the thakkar report said security officials appear to have 
taken things for granted it said high officials were aware 
of the threat to the life of the prime minister and that the 
unfortunate occurrence could have been averted through careful 
study and precautionary action 
thakkar finished his report in february 1986 but recommended it 
be kept secret lest its contents jeopardize other investigations 
only gandhi and two senior cabinet ministers had seen the report 
when parliament passed a resolution in july 1986 allowing it to be 
withheld 
two weeks ago the indian express newspaper published excerpts 
and oppostion lawmakers demanded the report be released gandhi 
made it public after some members of his congress party said they 
would do it if he did not 
the government says mrs gandhi was killed in revenge for an 
army raid she ordered in june 1984 on sikhdoms holiest shrine the 
golden temple to clear the compound of militants at least 1200 
people died most of them sikhs 
other bodyguards shot and killed one assassin beant singh and 
the other satwant singh was convicted of murder and hanged on 
jan 6 a third sikh kehar singh was convicted of conspiracy and 
hanged 
the three men were not related all male sikhs take the name 
singh which means lion

a bomb exploded near a british 
cultural center early tuesday hours after foreign secretary sir 
geoffrey howe of britain arrived to discuss the controversy over 
the novel the satanic verses 
police said no one was injured in the 1 am blast at a building 
under construction about 10 yards from the british council library 
it broke windows in the library and some surrounding shops but 
damage appeared to be slight bomb experts at the scene had no 
immediate information on the explosives used 
there were no claims of responsibility but the bombing appeared 
to be linked to antibritish protests over the satanic verses 
by salman rushdie a naturalized british subject born in india 
an explosion at a british council library in karachi pakistans 
largest city killed a pakistani guard on feb 27 police said they 
believed the blast was related to rushdies book 
moslems feel the novel blasphemes islam the book includes a 
brothel scene in which the prostitutes take the names of wives of 
the prophet mohammed and it suggests mohammad wrote the holy koran 
rather than receiving it directly from allah 
rushdie has been in hiding in britain since feb 14 when irans 
ayatollah ruhollah khomenie ordered moslems kill the author 
rushdie who was born a moslem but no longer practices religion 
has defended his work as a fictional examination of the nature of 
good and evil 
howe arrived in pakistan monday afternoon amid unprecedented 
security designed to prevent protests over the book 
about 2000 police lined the 12mile route from islamabad 
airport to the british embassy authorities barred wouldbe 
protesters from demonstrating at the embassy 
if our government would have allowed the demonstration howe 
would have felt the depth of our feeling said mustaza pooya a 
member of the conservative islamic democratic alliance 
pooya was among a delegation of fundamentalist religious leaders 
and rightwing pakistani politicians that was allowed to present a 
fourpage memorandum to the foreign secretary criticizing britain 
for protecting rushdie 
howe was willing to concede that the book certainly caused 
anguish pooya said after the meeting reporters were barred 
authorities imposed a ban on public gatherings in islamabad of 
more than five people during howes 26hour visit 
seven people died and more than 100 were injured in islamabad on 
feb 12 when hundreds of demonstrators battled police outside an

verses in the united states 
pakistan a moslem country of 107 million people banned the 
satanic verses after its publication in britain last september 
howe was to meet with prime minister benazir bhutto and 
president ghulam ishaq khan to discuss the rushdie crisis british 
aid to pakistan and both countries support of moslem rebels

days even though it was as big as a football field and brightly 
lit was towed back to new york after being discovered off bermuda 
a coast guard official said monday 
the empty barge the princess b drifted to sea during a storm 
feb 25 it was found march 17 by an oil tanker 180 miles west of

square miles of ocean for the barge which has strong floodlights 
and a homing device it was found by a passing ship that was not 
looking for it 
we had stopped looking for it so we were pretty surprised 
coast guard petty officer david jersey said monday in boston where 
the search was organized it should never have drifted so far

the government denied a news report that 
it seeks to trade a palestinian the united states accuses of 
terrorism for a fugitive greek banker held in an american jail 
government spokesman sotiris kostopoulos told reporters greece 
is not negotiating the extradition of mohammed rashid in 
exchange for george koskotas 
rashid 39 is wanted by the united states in the bombing of a 
pan am jetliner over hawaii in 1982 a japanese teenager was 
killed and 15 people were wounded 
greece wants koskotas 34 in a multimilliondollar financial 
scandal that emerged in october and has shaken the socialist 
government of premier andreas papandreou 
papandreou has spoken without elaboration of consequences 
if the united states does not extradite koskotas before the general 
election june 18 
a statement issued by the us embassy said the us 
government has never linked the two cases each case must be 
decided on its own merit 
both official responses followed a report by us news and world 
report an american weekly news magazine that an exchange was 
being discussed 
koskotas fled greece in november after being indicted in the 
200 million fraud forgery and embezzlement scandal he was 
arrested in the united states and is in jail in salem mass 
awaiting an extradition hearing 
in interviews from jail the former chairman of the bank of 
crete has claimed papandreou and other high government officials 
received millions of dollars in payoffs and authorized the looting 
of his bank 
eight greek government ministers resigned because of the 
scandal and four stateappointed managers of public enterprises 
such as the post office and telephone company have been sent to 
jail 
rashid was arrested in greece last may and jailed pending a 
decision on extradition from the supreme court which has been 
delayed twice 
he is to answer charges in court tuesday that he had a knife 
hidden in his cell rashid was cleared of the same charge feb 20 
but a district attorney asked that the verdict be overturned 
a conviction could delay extradition further

the supreme court was urged monday to find a 
national consensus against executing our young and ban the 
death penalty for all juvenile murderers 
there is a consensus of opinion in this country against 
executing our young argued attorney nancy mckerrow in behalf of 
a missouri death row inmate condemned for a murder he committed 
when he was 16 
but questions from the bench during two hours of arguments in 
cases from missouri and kentucky suggested the justices doubt that 
any clear consensus exists 
the high court is to decide by july whether imposing the death 
penalty on murderers who committed their crimes before reaching the 
age of 18 represents the cruel and unusual punishment banned by 
the constitutions eighth amendment 
in the missouri case heath wilkins was condemned for a murder 
he committed when he was 16 in the kentucky case kevin stanford 
was sentenced to death for a killing he committed when he was 17 
the courts decision will affect only 31 of the more than 2200 
death row inmates nationwide anticapital punishment forces 
nevertheless are attaching enormous importance to the issue 
the justices were told that of the 36 states with capital 
punishment laws only 12 ban the death penalty for killers who were 
under 18 when they committed their crimes 
noting the lack of unanimity among state legislatures chief 
justice william h rehnquist asked why should we set the bright 
line at 18 
ms mckerrow a lawyer from columbia mo answered that 18 is 
the age most commonly chosen for demarking the separation between 
childhood and adulthood 
she noted that 80 missouri laws treat individuals under 18 
differently from those over 18 including a law that bars 
juveniles from witnessing executions 
ms mckerrow also noted that the american bar association and 
the national council of juvenile court judges have supported 
banning capital punishment for juvenile killers 
frank heft jr a louisville lawyer argued for stanford that 
people under 18 are children who have not evolved into adults 
and who have a tremendous capacity for change 
the issue is not whether a line should be drawn but where to 
draw the line heft contended 
lawyers for missouri and kentucky urged the justices to leave 
any linedrawing to state legislatures 
what is a national consensus asked missouri assistant 
attorney general john morris iii 
he said the fact that wilkins the convicted missouri killer 
could have been condemned in 22 states despite his age 
demonstrates an absence of a national consensus regarding a 
minimum age for executions 
morris did not explain the apparent conflict between his use of 
the 22state figure and the fact that 24 of the 36 states with 
death penalty laws do not exempt those under 18 
kentucky attorney general frederic cowan said state legislatures 
may choose to exempt juveniles from the death penalty as a matter 
of mercy but argued the constitution is an instrument of 
justice not an instrument of mercy 
he added common sense dictates that youths mature at 
different rates 
the high court effectively drew the allowable capitalpunishment 
line at age 16 last year when it voted 53 to throw out the death 
penalty of an oklahoma killer who committed his crime when he was 
15 
four members of the court justices william j brennan 
thurgood marshall harry a blackmun and john paul stevens said 
in that decision that the death penalty is unconstitutional for 
those younger than 16 
three rehnquist and justices byron r white and antonin scalia 
said that the constitution does not set such age limits 
justice sandra day oconnor who asked only two neutral 
questions monday provided a fifth vote last year but stopped short 
of calling for the abolition of capital punishment for killers 
under 16 
she will provide a key vote in the missouri and kentucky cases 
so too will justice anthony m kennedy who joined the court in 
february 1988 too late to participate in the oklahoma case 
kennedy asked numerous questions monday some of which focused 
on a jurys ability to take a defendants youth into account even 
if the death penalty is a possibility 
the cases are wilkins vs missouri 876026 and heft vs cowan 
875765

be shown tehran radio reported 
the broadcast monitored in nicosia quoted a statement by the 
culture and information ministrys film division as saying the 
showing of this film especially in a moslem country is an insult

the chairman of the presidential commission 
that investigated the three mile island accident said monday that 
the nuclear power industry apparently has heeded the panels 
recommendations and become more safety conscious 
we warned them that unless they changed their attitude 
completely they would be out of business and it sounds to me as if 
they took it to heart john kemeny said on the eve of the 10th 
anniversary of the nations worst atomic power accident 
kemeny a former dartmouth college president based his 
assessment on a recent report by the institute of nuclear power 
operations a group the industry established after three mile 
island to work on safety issues the institute concluded that the 
nations 111 nuclear power plants now licensed are safer and more 
efficient 
im not saying that every problem has been fixed kemeny 
said in an interview but he said it was very hard for me to 
believe that its the same industry we really tore apart 10 years 
ago 
still kemeny said he was concerned that the nuclear regulatory 
commission may have become even more mired in a maze of regulations 
that dont necessarily insure safety 
referring to reports that the nrc mandated 149 changes based on 
his commissions recommendations kemeny said thats typical 
madness to me i wish they had mandated 40 important changes 
theyd have a much better chance of compliance 
kemeny 62 is a mathematician who had a small role in the 
manhattan project that developed the first atomic bomb during world 
war ii and who later worked as a research assistant to albert 
einstein president carter appointed kemeny to head a 12member 
commission to investigate the three mile island accident 
the panel spent six months investigating the march 28 1979 
partial meltdown at the nuclear power plant in middletown pa 
among its recommendations that the nrc adopted were establishing 
10mile evacuationplanning zones around commercial reactors and 
requiring an array of new controlroom equipment to better apprise 
operators of a plants safety status 
rep edward markey dmass charged during the weekend that 
nearly four out of five us atomic plants still have failed to 
complete all the changes 
kemeny did not dispute markeys allegations but reached a 
different conclusion noting an nrc officials statement that more 
than 97 percent of the changes have been completed 
remember these are all changes none of which were in place 
10 years ago kemeny said i think thats substantial change 
ten years ago kemeny called the nrc the worst government 
agency that existed he said he still has concerns 
what we found then was that they had such a huge number of 
regulations they regulated everything even minute things that 
many nuclear plant officials spent all their time making sure 
that they met all the regulations rather than worrying whether 
their plant was safe kemeny said 
i dont mean that those two things are inconsistent but just 
because you meet all the paper regulations does not mean your plant 
is safe 
kemeny said he hasnt followed the commission closely in recent 
years but noted that the private institute of nuclear power 
operations duplicates much of the information sharing inspection 
and training that the nrc does sometimes with stricter standards 
to me thats a suggestion that the industry itself feels that 
the nrc is not sufficient kemeny said 
let me say one thing for the nrc he added i dont think 
regulation alone can solve this problem unless the industry has a 
commitment to safety no amount of regulation can solve it

president daniel ortega urged the us 
congress on monday to reconsider a proposed aid package to the 
nicaraguan rebels saying the guerrillas were a cannon aimed at 
nicaragua 
ortega speaking to 60 harvard scholars from 37 countries 
accused the united states of ignoring a central american peace plan 
that commits regional leaders to drafting a program by midmay to 
dismantle the rebel force 
he said of the bipartisan aid package unveiled friday in 
washington it reaffirms once again the policy that the strongest 
can act without regard for the will of others 
the proposal worked out between the bush administration and 
congressional leaders provides 45 million a month in 
nonmilitary aid to the rebels known as contras the current 271 
million in humanitarian aid runs out friday 
the package proposes aid at least through november and could 
continue through feb 28 1990 if congressional committees approve 
if the us congress were respectful of our accord it would 
approve aid for 90 days and gear it to the dismantling of the 
contras ortega told the gathering of mason fellowship scholars 
in nicaragua on a oneday visit 
what theyre trying to do is maintain intact a force in 
honduran territory which is like a cannon aimed at nicaragua the 
president of honduras himself has insisted he has not agreed that 
the contras remain for another 10 months or a year 
he said congress still has time to rectify and show its 
respect for the will of the central american presidents 
ortega moved up general elections in nicaragua by 10 months to 
feb 25 1990 as part of the regional peace plan he and the 
presidents of el salvador honduras guatemala and costa rica 
reached in el salvador on feb 14 
the presidents agreed to come up with a plan by midmay to 
demobilize up to 11000 contras living in honduran jungle camps 
near nicaragua with about 12000 relatives 
most guerrillas moved from nicaragua into the camps after 
congress cut off military aid in february 1988 a month later the 
contras and sandinistas signed a ceasefire which nicaragua has 
been extending every month since 
ortega said congress might consider redirecting the proposed 45 
million in aid to nicaragua which could use the money to build 
9000 homes for victims of last octobers hurricane joan 
he said with 45 million nicaragua could buy food to feed 
750000 people for seven months or milk for 28 million children 
that indeed would be humanitarian aid ortega said we 
hope this is a document with a rhetorical tint and that deep 
inside it really is looking for a peaceful solution but their 
actions will be the determinant factor 
responding to questions ortega said he finds it inconceivable 
that the ruling sandinista national liberation front could lose 
next years elections 
the people would have to be crazy to vote against the front 
against the revolution ortega said the peasant the worker 
who has seen his wife his son killed by the contras is not going 
to vote against the front 
he said nicaraguans have discovered the capacity of 
capitalism to exploit them to keep them in ignorance the capacity 
to deny them the right to organize now the day the people 
dont want any more revolution they have the vote and the weapons 
in their hands the people decide the front cannot impose anything 
on the people 
barricada the official sandinista paper and the progovernment 
el nuevo diario said monday the us aid package is proof the 
sandinistas won nicaraguas eightyear civil war 
us makes official nicaraguas triumph said el nuevo 
diarios headline 
erick ramirez of the socialchristian party said the us aid 
proposal sounded the rebels death knell 
it effectively foresees the end of the war he said in an 
interview the war has no future and i believe the united states 
must channel its efforts in that direction

policymakers at the federal reserve sifting 
through murky economic data probably will not tighten credit 
further this week but will indicate they stand ready to push 
interest rates higher if inflationary pressures do not abate soon 
private economists predicted monday 
the central bank facing growing political pressure over fears 
of a possible recession is likely to postpone further credit 
tightening for the time being at a meeting this week many 
economists believe although they expect this respite will be brief 
most analysts are forecasting that a variety of interest rates 
including banks prime lending rate and mortgage rates will be 
headed higher in the months ahead as the fed struggles to keep 
inflation from getting out of control

the improving us trade deficit the biggest 
factor promoting domestic growth last year is on the verge of 
stalling out unless the bush administration moves quickly to 
devalue the dollar and reach a budget agreement with congress a 
research institute warned monday 
the institute for international economics said that unless the 
united states is able to get its trade problems under control the 
country faces the threat of a recession triggered by the flight of 
foreigners from us investments 
there is also a danger that rising trade deficit would force 
congress and the administration to erect protectionist trade 
barriers that would threaten a global trade war according to the 
study american trade adjustment the global impact 
the report said without needed policy changes americas trade 
deficit will begin rising again in 1990 and by 1992 will surpass 
the record imbalance of 154 billion set in 1987

call it a reluctance to work on 
windswept rooftops knead dough at four oclock in the morning or 
get dirty installing furnaces 
whatever the reasons west germany is facing a serious shortage 
of young people interested in skilled manual labor 
the situation has become so serious that the federal government 
in bonn is calling on ethnic german immigrants and women to apply 
for the jobs at the same time it is urging some students to look 
to skilled manual labor instead of universities which are 
overflowing 
at a recent manual labor trade fair in kassel about 110 miles 
north of frankfurt construction worker friedrick baum 64 
explained what the longrange effects of the trainee shortage might 
be in his trade 
our generation was the one that rebuilt the country after the 
war he said sometimes when i look back i cant believe what 
we accomplished 
now with many of us getting ready to retire and not enough 
apprentices to train were facing an experience gap that will get 
worse over the next 10 years 
education minister juergen moellemann has proposed that the 
government increase its annual spending on the training of 
specialists in labor and technical fields by the equivalent of 216 
million to 13 billion 
chancellor helmut kohl recently told the rhineland palatinate 
state labor chamber that it should fill the trainee gap with women 
or young ethnic german immigrants from countries in eastern europe 
this would not only signal solidarity with our own people and 
help them he said it can be an enrichment to take on these 
people who often show an especially high motivation for work 
some oldtimers in the countrys 126 trades classified as manual 
labor say west german young people today want only white collar 
jobs 
federal labor office figures for january indicated that 23 
million west germans were unemployed but that only 92402 of the 
jobless were youths or new trainee prospects 
with so few prospects employers say that finding manual labor 
trainees is difficult 
helmut gress who runs a plumbing and heating company in 
koenigstein about 20 miles north of frankfurt says he has been 
trying for two years to find an apprentice 
there just doesnt seem to be anyone interested he said 
i think they see the work as too hard and sometimes dirty 
hannelore eckes 50 who with her husband horst operates a 
bakery in the same town said their search for a trainee has been 
fruitless 
weve tried to find either a young woman or man since the end 
of the last school year but no one wants to do manual work 
anymore part of it is because our day starts at 4 am and we 
work half days on saturday 
at the kassel trade fair guenter griehs a 65yearold retired 
welder manned a booth advertising for young people to get into the 
welding business 
its not like it was when i became an apprentice he said 
in those days we were encouraged and proud to become master 
tradesmen 
parents and schools are partly at fault because they push 
children to keep studying for office work and computers rather than 
work with their hands 
he said industries such as automakers hire away many young 
people with starting salaries as high as 550 a month while most 
apprentices in manual trades average 190 to 375 a month 
karl weinhold 57 a senior construction worker at another booth 
at the fair said the building industry has its own special 
problems that discourage youth 
when you move heavy stones around to build houses from age 16 
on by the time youre 45 your spine is so worn out you cant walk 
straight anymore the young know this

the night is dark and dismal on dresdener street 
suddenly bizarre lights and music burst from a rusty old vending 
machine as miniature monsters stare sinisterly from inside 
no this is not the twilight zone 
its the blumenautomat galerie where a few coins buy 
strange tiny sculptures created by georg glueckman and suwan 
laimanee and a show that keeps fans coming back for more 
in its previous life the blumenautomat galerie flower 
automat gallery was an afterhours vending machine that dispensed 
posies to passersby 
but now it is one of the most talked about multimedia art events 
in europe pulling its creators out of years of obscurity 
glueckman and laimanee came up with the idea as an alternative 
means of promoting their modernistic concept of art and say it is 
europes only 24hour art gallery 
this is not what you would call a conventional exhibition 
its not what you would call a normal thing acknowledged the 
wry 37yearold laimanee who is originally from thailand 
the mansize automat is bolted to a wall on dimly lighted 
dresdener street a culdesac in one of the poorest sections of 
west berlin placed inside the machines 12 compartments are 
toylike creations made by laimanee and glueckman at the 
madetosell price of about 380 each 
the flower automat gallery is a humble but eerielooking 
machine indeed sometimes it seems to have a life of its own 
laimanee deposits coins and pulls a bugeyed monster sculpture 
from one of the compartments the lefthand side of the rusty 
machine bursts into a brilliant light show to the accompaniment of 
strange music put together by laimanee and glueckman on a tape 
recorder two minutes later the show is over and the vending 
machine has returned to a state of repose 
our flower automat gallery is really a work of art in 
itself said laimanee 
every four weeks the artists change the miniature creations and 
play host for the premiere of a new show laimanee also has to fill 
up the machine every day because of the great public demand 
the flower automat gallery has captured the curiousity of arts 
enthusiasts across europe articles have been written by the 
munichbased new art in europe magazine west germanys respected 
die zeit weekly newspaper and other publications laimanee and 
glueckman have been interviewed in television programs that have 
reached audiences from belgium to austria 
their fame last year resulted in an invitation to show their 
larger works creations known as room installations in 
warsaw poland 
for years laimanee and glueckman took the traditional route of 
displaying their larger works in rented berlin rooms 
their break came in 1987 when they noticed the flower vending 
machine across the street from the upandcoming zwinger art 
gallery they picked up the automat free of charge from a flower 
shop that no longer used it 
the flower automat gallery was an immediate success when it 
opened in october 1987 thriving on the ready market of curious 
patrons of the zwinger gallery 
its not big money and were not getting rich but we can pay 
our bills laimanee said

as a rhodesian soldier bruce mooreking 
believed the good were white the evil were black and the war he 
fought was a noble struggle waged in the name of christian 
democracy 
a decade later he is convinced the war to prevent black 
majority rule was immoral and looks back with shame at how he and 
thousands of other white rhodesians accepted simplistic 
jingoistic nonsense from their leaders 
far worse he says his fellow whites still hold blacks in 
contempt and he fears they are throwing away their last chance for 
peace in the land now called zimbabwe 
once a member of an elite counterguerrilla force the grey 
scouts mooreking has written the first published reproval of the 
sevenyear war by a former supporter of white rule 
in white man black war mooreking accuses the leaders 
elders he calls them in what was the breakaway british 
colony of rhodesia of an inflexibility that led to the deaths of 
1400 whites and 27000 blacks before the white minority gave up 
power under british pressure in 1978 
these elders valued the comfort of their lifestyles beyond the 
lives of their children mooreking writes in the book published 
by zimbabwes yearold baobab books it was greed that sent us to 
war 
the 134page volume has caused a stir among blacks and whites 
who fought or lived through the conflict that ended with rhodesias 
transition to independent blackgoverned zimbabwe it provoked 
numerous reviews in the local media with one white lawyer saying 
the book was like peeling a scab off and seeing how well the 
wound was healing 
moorekings unforgiving and brutal accounts of war atrocities 
form the basis of his scathing indictment of rhodesias leaders he 
particularly assails ian smith the prime minister of rhodesia 
calling him the whites high priest 
mr smith along with the farmers businessmen and other 
politicians told us that we were not fighting to persecute 
oppress or deny our black countrymen we killed and burned to 
save them from communism mooreking writes 
the shameful part of our history is not that we were wrong 
just that we were so childishly thoughtless mooreking said in 
an interview at his modest home in ruwa about 20 miles east of 
harare formerly salisbury the capital the house is off a dirt 
road surrounded by african bush and black neighbors 
mooreking 36 said the book published in december and now 
into its second printing was born of anger and fear he felt after 
returning to his homeland in 1985 after a sevenyear absence 
i feared the whites in this country were screwing up the 
opportunity to live in this land he said they have been given 
a second chance in a way 
an estimated 90000 whites remain in zimbabwe out of the 250000 
or so in the early 1970s 
the irony is that having lost the war we havent lost the 
lifestyle mooreking added 
most whites in zimbabwe live in spacious homes many with 
swimming pools and tennis courts and cared for by black servants 
smith who still lives in zimbabwe said he does not intend to 
read white man black war and dismissed mooreking as a 
crank 
it seems at one time he was a great grey scout said smith 
in a telephone interview now hes turned against everything he 
once believed 
mooreking who is bearded broad and imposingly tall was a 
sergeant in the grey scouts a mounted infantry unit used as a 
mobile fireforce and specializing in highspeed tracking 
in flowing impressionistic style his book recounts wanton 
destruction torture and pointless massacres 
soldiers mistakenly bomb a schoolhouse in which black civilians 
have taken refuge and 123 are killed a nanny and two pics 
walking home late at night are gunned down by inexperienced young 
soldiers who mistake them for guerrillas a black man hangs 
spreadeagled on a steel bedframe while a soldier sends electric 
jolts through wires attached to his scrotum and a nipple 
mooreking left rhodesia in 1978 and wandered around europe for 
several years still believing the war was a noble affair 
i swore i wasnt a racist and justified it by saying i didnt 
hate black people they just werent ready for independence he 
said 
moorekings attitude began to shift when he went to south 
africa in the early 1980s and worked at an insurance agency on an 
equal basis with blacks 
when he returned to zimbabwe upon the death of his parents he 
feared retaliation by the black government instead he said he 
was welcomed back by blacks who treated him with respect 
but he found attitudes little changed among whites 
in his book mooreking tells of a moment soon after his return 
when his landlord found him sharing tea on his porch with a black 
neighbor not only were mooreking and his wife evicted but the 
landlord locked the vegetable garden mooreking had left to his 
black friend the book paints the pitiful scene of the hungry black 
man looking longingly through a fence at tomatoes rotting on the 
vine 
it was one of a number of things that i thought were repugnant 
morally but also dangerous and stupid the way anger was being 
stirred up in blacks said mooreking who plans soon to leave 
his job as a harare insurance agent to work on his second book 
i can understand now why our countrymen took up arms against 
us he wrote in his first book and if these actions and 
attitudes and forms of selective ignorance displayed by my tribe 
once caused blood and fire to spread across the land called 
rhodesia what will these same actions and attitudes and forms of 
selective ignorance produce in this land called zimbabwe

land of albania thou rugged nurse 
of savage men wrote lord byron perhaps albanias most famous 
literary tourist 
albanians have changed since he visited in the early 18th 
century but being a tourist in europes most isolated country 
still is an adventure for outsiders 
whether arriving at tiranas bumpy airport touring the 
picturesque countryside or lounging on the marvelous beaches a 
traveler seems constantly surrounded by the same faces albanias 
everpresent secret police the sigurimi keep an eye on all 
foreigners 
traffic on the winding narrow roads is almost nonexistent with 
only the occasional truck or horsedrawn cart bumping along in the 
dust 
thats probably why albanian drivers have an unnerving tendency 
not to worry so much about sharp curves to the horror of their 
foreign passengers 
but what if we run into albanias other bus a foreigner on 
a tourist bus joked eliciting a sour glance from the albanian 
driver 
the wild and jagged mountains of albanias interior offer 
breathtaking views of forests and streams in deep precipices while 
the few and scattered villages are surrounded by carefully tended 
terraced fields 
in the countryside only women are seen tilling the communal 
fields and small plots each family has been allotted in an apparent 
attempt to increase food supplies 
the long sandy beaches and the lack of crowds make albanias 
adriatic seaside resorts a far cry from europes crowded summer 
retreats although one is apt to run into the everpresent men in 
dark suits and sunglasses among the bathers 
since world war ii albania has been sealed off by the harshest 
communist regime in europe 
the isolationism and fear of the outside world is exemplified by 
the thousands of empty bunkers in the countryside and on beaches 
the weapon slits in the bunkers are mostly bricked over now that 
albania has decided it does not have to be on the alert against 
invasion 
but moonlight dips in the sea are strictly forbidden and police 
patrol the beaches apparently to discourage citizens from swimming 
off to the nearby greek island of corfu or to the foreign ships 
riding at anchor 
visitors are often lodged in hotels built by the italians when 
they ruled albania before or during world war ii most of the 
furniture and fittings in the adriatic hotel in durres appear to be 
left over from that period 
lodging comes moderately expensive for foreigners 280 lekas 
40 a day for the room only 
albania closed its borders with greece and yugoslavia in the 
1940s and ordinary albanians are forbidden to travel abroad the 
10000 foreign tourists who come annually are restricted to 
organized group travel 
no americans are allowed however since the united states is 
still considered albanias foremost enemy most of the tourists are 
from italy west germany and britain 
there is very little to do in the evenings since nightlife as 
it is known in the west is nonexistent and the primary 
entertainment for albanians is to watch television programs from 
yugoslavia italy and greece 
albanians used to hide tv antennas under the rooftops of their 
homes when the communist leader enver hoxha died in 1985 after a 
41year rule citizens gradually became bolder and put them outside 
for better reception 
forests of antennas now sprout from decrepit concrete apartment 
blocks where most albanians live 
few women are seen on the streets of towns there are fewer cars 
and no pets food is not plentiful in albania and citizens choose 
not to waste it on dogs and cats

paul junger witt and tony thomas noted for 
their hip urban comedies have turned to the soil for their newest 
series cbs heartland 
heartland may be the first television comedy to milk laughs 
from farm folk without portraying them as awshucks hayseeds 
this is from an idea thats been percolating for a while 
said witt we started a long time ago with the idea that the farm 
is the last of the family businesses and although the american 
family farms are disappearing the people running them are some of 
the most clever and inventive people in business people on farms 
are now sophisticated and no longer culturally isolated 
rather than the images we were raised with we wanted to 
portray them as the last vestige of the connecticut yankee farming 
is a complex business that requires you to be mechanic 
veterinarian agronomist and many other things all at once in 
talking to farmers we found that it was laughter that helped them 
get through the hard times 
heartland which made its debut on march 20 stars brian 
keith richard gilliland kathleen layman jason kristofer devin 
ratray and daisy keith as a family living in nebraska it was 
created by don reo 
the family farm coalition has urged its 42 organizations in 35 
states to ask its members to watch the show 
other wittthomas shows are the golden girls empty nest 
and beauty and the beast 
keith starring in his seventh series portrays family patriarch 
bl mccutcheon mccutcheon is outspoken and cantankerous two 
characteristics keith virtually holds a patent on hes lost his 
own farm and lives with his daughter and soninlaw daisy keith 
who plays mccutcheons granddaughter is keiths reallife daughter 
that allows us to play to a very primal conflict said witt 
very few fathers ever believe that their soninlaw is worthy of 
their daughter thats a great source of comedy and conflict 
theres little that they agree on from raising children to farming 
to politics 
both witt and thomas agreed that it was hard to launch a show 
with only six episodes on a thirdplace network its tough to 
get sampling at any time and its especially tough to get the 
audience to sample a show with only six episodes said witt 
the phrase we use is its tough to hit the green 
partners since 1976 witt and thomas have produced such shows as 
soap benson it takes two hail to the chief and 
im a big girl now in the past both worked for danny thomas 
productions and spellinggoldberg productions 
thomas is the son of entertainer danny thomas witt is married 
to writerproducer susan harris who created soap and the 
golden girls 
bureaucracy is the enemy of comedy said thomas who wants 
to keep the company small most major studios havent been as 
successful as the independent producers with comedy 
the wittthomas show beauty and the beast was a big risk for 
the producers a onehour show is a financial burden for an 
independent producer because the network licensing fee does not 
cover all the costs 
witt said beauty and the beast was hurt by the writers 
strike which delayed its fall premiere to nov 19 and by its 
temporary move from friday to monday nights 
the concept of a noble heroic manbeast living underground in 
new york could easily have turned out corny without the right 
execution 
its an epic love story said witt its also very 
literate and stylized the people read shakespeare and poems it 
was a risk creatively and financially its still not profitable 
but every once in a while you find something you want to do because 
you like it

terry anderson is two weeks into his fifth 
year as a hostage in beirut and business is proceeding about as 
usual which means that none is evident 
for the hostages business as usual means only waiting 
now that the fouryear anniversary observances are over the 
hostage issue is back on the back burner an agonizing frustrating 
riddle in which nine americans are held captive and silent by 
moslem extremists who are themselves silent most of the time 
after a capitol hill ceremony on the anderson anniversary date 
march 16 there were going to be yellow ribbons on display around 
congress and a resolution seeking action to end the hostage 
ordeal although no specific step was or could be proposed 
neither ribbons nor resolutions are in evidence not that they 
would change the situation but it has dragged now to the point at 
which symbols become substitutes for acts no one has been able to 
devise 
president bush suggested as he took office two months ago that 
moves by iran to assist the hostages to establish contact and help 
gain their release would be a significant step toward a time of 
better relations with the united states 
there was no response he has said no more on the subject 
that is the standstill into which jesse jackson now proposes to 
move with a renewed humanitarian campaign for the release of 
foreign hostages in lebanon fifteen are known to be held nine of 
them americans 
jackson said they shouldnt be left out of mind because they are 
out of sight 
anderson chief middle east correspondent for the associated 
press has been held longer than any other hostage he and jackson 
became acquainted when anderson covered the release of navy lt 
robert o goodman a downed flier held for a month by the syrians 
jackson went to damascus to appeal for goodmans release and to 
escort him home 
he said he would go back to the middle east now to work for the 
release of anderson and the others if he had leads contacts and 
indications such a mission would help 
first he said there should be a humanitarian appeal in 
messages on radio on television and in lebanese newspaper 
advertisements he said he is looking for sponsors to finance that 
effort 
in lebanon the captors are basically nameless and faceless 
he said in an interview at his chicago headquarters therefore 
the appeal has to be a broadbased appeal to religious and 
political leaders and others who care 
the black civil rights activist and twotime democratic 
presidential candidate said such appeals were making headway and 
might have succeeded in 1985 but were undercut by the 
administrations arms deals with iran 
two american hostages were freed during the arms dealings 
jackson invited the interview on his projected renewal of public 
appeals in lebanon for release of the hostages he said private 
appeals can work we should not interfere with the government in 
its efforts jackson said but the governments efforts are 
both modest and ineffective 
he acknowledged that he doesnt know what efforts the new 
administration is planning or making for the hostages 
humanitarian appeals have been made before and have failed 
before indeed one of the men who made them terry waite envoy of 
the archbishop of canterbury was himself kidnapped on jan 20 
1987 and remains hostage 
the captors after all are no humanitarians 
but jackson said they cannot operate without the tacit support 
or at least acquiescence of the society around them 
we want to put the focus again back on the captured as well as 
on the basic agony of the captors he said we need to have 
those holding the hostages know that americans are concerned about 
the rebuilding of lebanon about the children in the camps about 
the invasions and the bombings 
we are concerned about that so was terry

at a time when the french are trying to whip up 
enthusiasm for the 200th anniversary of their revolution visitors 
will be treated to an american exhibition in galeries lafayette 
frances bestknown department store 
a major art exhibition will form the backbone of the show in the 
paris store which also includes a texmex restaurant a 
demonstration of navajo arts and crafts and phone booths offering 
free threeminute phone calls to the united states 
the exhibition might be dubbed the biggest show and sell 
gambit ever attempted in france because its also a commercial 
enterprise aimed at selling thousands of items made in the 
usa 
we feel the united states was the most obvious choice for our 
annual show devoted to a foreign country said jeanmichel 
girardin director of promotions and sales 
he pointed out that people in both countries battled for liberty 
in the late l8th century and that the marquis de lafayette a 
french statesman had championed the american patriots cause as a 
general under george washington in the american revolutionary war 
lafayettes gesture was viewed suspiciously by the french who 
first condemned him but finally welcomed him back as a hero in 1781 
when they saw how hed defeated their archenemies the english 
the exhibition of 50 american paintings from the wadsworth 
atheneum in hartford conn is the most important such show 
sponsored by a retailer in france 
chosen by the museums curator patrick mccaughy the 
paintings will cover the chief periods of art in america said 
georges meyer chairman of galeries lafayette 
insured for 50 million the canvases will range from the works 
of the scenic hudson river school to the abstract expressionism of 
jackson pollock and the pop art of andy warhol 
also on show will be whistlers coast of brittany as well 
as winslow homers boy in a dory georgia okeeffes upside 
down painting of dh lawrences pine tree and an impressionistic 
landscape of etretat a beach in normandy by george inness 
this will be a new kind of audience for an art show said 
girardin intimating that these casual visitors would have fewer 
preconceived ideas than the usual culture vultures at art 
exhibitions 
bound to be a crowdpleaser are 16 vintage cars contributed by 
ford motor co to be placed on the rooftop terrace long queues are 
expected for the first week of the american telephone amp telegraph 
corp phonebooth exhibit when free phone calls to the united 
states will be offered from 2 pm to 6 pm as part of a 
creditcard promotion 
navajos from santa fe nm will be on hand in their 
workshopboutique to demonstrate how they weave rugs make pottery 
and silver jewelry and elsewhere professional seamstresses will 
demonstrate the fine art of making a quilt 
skateboard demonstrations by californians are expected to knock 
em off their feet if the harleydavidson motorcycle exhibit 
doesnt first 
and a french cactus buff will show off new breeds of the prickly 
succulent 
while the rio grande restaurant from paris les halles district 
serves up chili con carne gastronomes may also sample treats at 
the typically american food shop the eclectic food selection 
will either fascinate gallic gourmets or send them galloping away 
in droves frozen yogurt pop corn diet products biologic food 
products wine without alcohol and kentucky bourbon for kicks 
the hamilton beach co was to contribute cookery items 
considered indispensable to the american way of life including 
a corn popper a milkshaker a doughkneader and a hot dog cooker 
fashions home furnishings accessories and leisure products 
will complete the vast show designer styles will be from 
parisbased patrick kelly ralph lauren betsy johnson tahari 
charlotte neuville and leon max 
french couture will make a cameo appearance on about 20 models 
fashioned by top designers for barbie dolls 
the saks boutique will not only show and sell redwhiteblue 
socks and beach robes but offer chocolate cake and bloody marys to 
cheer the weary 
in a more sedate vein new yorks museum of modern art will have 
a gift shop of museum copies 
with all this american razzledazzle what does the french store 
expect to be the biggest sensation 
well maybe some of that naughty underwear the californians 
are going to show said girardin it may be like taking coals 
to newcastle but ive never seen any worse even up in our 
redlight district pigalle 
similar shows in 14 branches around the country will take place 
at the same time from march 29 to april 30

chinese students are flocking to japan as language 
students but many come only for the big money they can earn 20 
times wages at home in jobs outside the classroom immigration 
officials say 
some come in hopes of eventually getting to the united states 
many fall victim to unscrupulous language schools that charge 
inflated fees for bogus study programs and introductions to the 
japanese sponsors they need for visas 
foreign students in japan are allowed to earn the equivalent of 
1000 a month a fortune by chinese standards 
last year 28256 chinese entered japan to study japanese up 
from 1199 in 1985 the justice ministrys immigration bureau says 
many if not most use the language study as a pretense to get 
into japan only about 1600 chinese students came last year to 
pursue formal studies from literature to management at regular 
universities and graduate schools they dont fall into category of 
those who come mainly to work 
the flood came after japan changed immigration rules in 1987 to 
permit language students to work as much as 20 hours a week 
the chinese come because they hear they can earn 2 million yen 
16000 in two years said immigration spokesman sadao kawakita 
the schools are vastly overbooking in january we cracked down 
on 23 schools with a capacity of 5000 that had accepted 
applications and fees from 15000 chinese who now wont get 
visas 
the schools were ordered to restructure by july one which 
issed phony sponsorship papers was closed down 
today 38000 chinese in shanghai alone are waiting for japanese 
visas in december thousands rallied at japans consulate in 
shanghai demanding visas for which they had paid brokers and 
protesting stricter rules on guarantors 
japan requires that foreign students have guarantors japanese 
with an annual salary of at least 5 million yen 40000 who vouch 
for the students conduct and financial wellbeing 
finding guarantors has become a big business with student 
brokers borrowing or sometimes inventing names they sell to 
chinese desperate for a visa 
i paid a hong kong visa broker 2700 us dollars to find me 
a guarantor said a 21yearold electrician who identified 
himself only as zhou he had to borrow virtually all of it he 
said so he works 56 hours a week in violation of immigration 
rules at a restuarant and sends home 80000 yen 640 monthly 
tuition averages 30000 yen 240 a month 
most chinese language students work as day laborers or in 
restaurants bars and small factories 
wu zizhong 27 works six days a week at a small printing 
factory for 600 yen 480 an hour standard for japan he also 
works some nights sorting letters until dawn at a post office where 
about 100 other chinese work part time for 1000 yen 8 an hour 
he said he takes naps in japanese class and during breaks at the 
printing plant 
he and others also violate the 20hour immigration rule 
violators generally get away with it because the students often 
work in more than one place and pay no taxes making it difficult 
for authorities to keep track of them 
a radio technician from shanghai named shen says he saves 50000 
yen 400 a month and wants to bring his girlfriend to japan and 
then try to go to the united states 
shen paid 90000 yen 720 to his school one of the 23 that 
were disciplined to find his girlfriend a guarantor 
now they cant do it and i dont think ill see that money 
again he said 
like shen many chinese dream fervently of going to the united 
states and some make it usually if they have relatives there 
others go to great lengths trying 
we get dozens of chinese every day seeking permanent 
residence said a consular officer at the bolivian embassy in 
tokyo but i dont think they even know where bolivia is they 
somehow have this idea that this is how they can get to america 
but one woman from beijing who works nights as a club hostess 
said she had a different goal 
i want so much to go to college but in china i cant im too 
old she said i dont really like japanese or japan but i had 
no chance to go anywhere else

the war veterans at the riehler 
home for the aged tend to get more riled up about the earrings and 
tigerstriped pants worn by civvies than the fact that the 
young men have refused military service 
civvies or civilian servants are conscientious objectors who 
opt for their constitutional right to reject military service and 
work instead in the most menial of health care and manual labor 
jobs 
amid an increasingly tolerant west german public and an imminent 
lengthening of both military and civilian service terms the number 
of young men filing for conscientious objector status has climbed 
dramatically in recent months 
the pacifist corps grew by more than 22 percent last year alone 
swelling the force to a record 85000 and rekindling worries among 
some labor union officials that the civvies who earn only about 300 
marks 160 a month will take jobs away from regular workers 
on the whole however civvies are finding widespread acceptance 
among their countrymen 
we have occasional problems between the conservative older 
residents and the civilian service workers but it is more often an 
objection about the kind of clothes they wear than their moral or 
political views observed josef gerlach a psychologist in charge 
of care for the 1200 residents of the riehler home the nations 
largest facility for the elderly 
the residents are actually more likely to lash out at each 
other calling this or that one an old nazi 
civvies like 24yearold gerd daassen who has been feeding 
bathing and cleaning up residents at the riehler home since 
october confirm that their decisions against bearing arms stir 
little hostility 
a lot of them ask me why i am doing this instead of serving in 
the army daasaen said during a break but it seems to be more 
a curiosity than a judgment when i tell them that i cannot kill 
another man and therefore have to reject military service they 
seem to understand 
peter hintze federal commissioner for the civilian service 
said in an interview at his bonn office that he considers the broad 
acceptance of conscientious objection in west germany a sign of a 
healthy and mature society 
in the 1960s the public reaction was very negative the 
phrase used then for civilian servants was shirker said 
hintze a former anglican minister in the 1970s there was 
mostly skepticism who are these guys people wondered but now 
as the 1980s draw to a close the choice of civilian service is 
broadly accepted 
the pacifist trend among west germans began abruptly in 1968 a 
year of widespread student protests against militarism and a time 
of anxiety over the vietnam war 
refusal to bear arms has grown steadily ever since 
hintze and his adviser achim schmidt attribute most of the 
sharp rise in civilian service entries over the past year to the 
defense ministrys plan to lengthen the obligatory army service 
from 15 to 18 months beginning in june 
the civilian service term now is 20 months but will be extended 
to two years after june 
the willingness to serve longer demonstrates commitment to the 
alternative service said hintze a civvie himself in the 1970s 
civvies serve longer because they often can find positions in 
their own communities while soldiers have to wear uniforms put in 
longer hours and live away from home 
all west german men reaching the age of 18 are obligated to 
register for military service but education deferments are easily 
obtained 
hintze said the percentage of military draftees refusing army 
service has grown steadily over the past two decades to about 12 
percent that figure is significantly larger than in neighboring 
countries where usually less than 1 percent called for service 
refuse to bear arms 
west germans acceptance of conscientious objectors can be 
explained in part by the nations tragic experience with war and 
militarism during the first half of this century and its position 
on the frontline with eastern europe 
the nations basic law set down 40 years ago when the new 
postwar west german state was formed was the first constitution in 
the world to grant citizens the right to chose an alternative to 
military service 
the civvies most often find jobs caring for the elderly and 
handicapped but they also get into fields like environmental 
protection zoo and park maintenance and search and rescue

nation has been rebelling against the familial bounds of bloc

possible but west germans concede the prospects are slim as time

embrace either the social or economic reforms championed by soviet 
leader mikhail s gorbachev 
honecker maintains that a wholesale revamping of the type 
gorbachev espouses with his perestroika or rebuilding project 
is unnecessary in east germany because of his nations relative 
success among the socialist states 
the 76yearold honecker reported at times to be in ill health 
but showing no signs of an intent to bow out as head of the 
socialist unity party dismisses suggestions of a unified germany 
as an unrealistic refusal to deal with the political facts 
he has also dashed hopes that east germany in the age of 
gorbachev and glasnost might be willing to dismantle the berlin 
wall that western leaders have labeled an anachronism of the cold 
war 
responding to appeals during a recent vienna human rights 
conference that the wall be torn down honecker declared it would 
stand another 50 or 100 years as long as the differences dividing 
east and west demand it 
the wall was erected in 1961 to stop the flood of east germans 
seeking refuge in the west 
contrary to its intention it is daily proof that the question 
it tried to answer remains unanswered west german president 
richard von weizsaecker has said it makes the idea of belonging 
together conspicuous an idea which it sought to make us forget

editors note its a vast enigmatic wilderness sitting 
incongruously in the midst of the new yorkphiladelphia 
megalopolis ringed by the urban sprawl that gave new jersey a bad 
name with the creation of the pinelands national reserve a decade 
ago the 1 millionplus acres have been spared bulldozers running 
rampant much to the chagrin of some landowners

to the nature buff new 
jerseys pinelands are miles of pygmy pines deep forest creeks 
and bogs 
to romantics the pinelands might be symbolized by the waretown 
cabin where fiddler george albert once played through the night or 
the general store in chatsworth that still offers a table for 
coffee and gossip 
in folklore its the birthplace of the jersey devil a place 
where men live in caves and marry their sisters 
but to some landowners pinelands is only a title an 
annoying federal designation that stifles development and profit 
in reality the more than 11 million acres comprising the 
pinelands in southern new jersey are a unique medley of tremendous 
historical and environmental significance 
ringed by the urban sprawl that gave new jersey a bad name the 
region gained national recognition in november 1978 when president 
jimmy carter signed the national parks and recreation act that 
included the creation of the pinelands national reserve 
carters act stopped any talk of a supersonic jetport in the 
middle of this vast space a frightening prospect for an area 
already being invaded by the rush of metropolitan housing 
developers 
ten years ago it seemed that nothing within two hours of new 
york city would be left untouched 
but the pinelands reserve the largest remaining open tract in 
the midatlantic states was saved 
in a unique arrangement the state of new jersey manages the 
federal reserve keeping largescale development in outlying areas 
and maintaining the undisturbed nature of thousands of acres in the 
middle the state with federal financial help is slowly buying 
property to add to the total reserve most of which is still 
privately owned 
the state pinelands commission now operates with a management 
plan that is both commended and condemned in addition 56 
municipalities within the pinelands are involved in modifying their 
master development plans to make them conform with the goals of the 
protection effort 
when the pinelands plan developed there had to be 
accommodations and some people were hurt and some people were 
helped says pearl schwartz of toms river a member of the ocean 
county environmental agency and the ocean nature society 
but the overall picture that has emerged in 10 years has been 
on the side of good we have been able to control growth which is 
not happening in the rest of the state 
more than 100 years ago the parts of atlantic burlington 
camden cape may cumberland gloucester and ocean counties that 
are now the pinelands made up a prosperous region filled with iron 
charcoal and glass industries utilizing the bountiful raw 
materials in later years sawmills and wineries flourished 
today only the names of colonialera villages remain along 
with remnants of the piney lifestyle few still follow the 
tradipine cones clams and 
sphagnum moss to live off the land 
the pinelands heritage is going to die off very soon says 
kenneth yates a tabernacle blueberry farmer who grew up among 
generations of pineys we dont even have much of a historical 
society anymore the young people dont want to get involved 
older homes are getting torn down because the younger 
generation is not about to live primitive and people are still 
living in the woods but with all the modern conveniences 
some southern new jersey natives are flattered to be called a 
piney but not others 
a piney is a threeheaded incestuous idiot that cant walk or 
talk says joe horner a member of a pinelands band we are 
indigenous residents born here raised here growed up here and 
will die here pineys are people who moved here from brooklyn to 
live off the land 
russ horner picking on a guitar nearby chimes in the whole 
thing is a hoax the idea of people stumbling around the pinelands 
picking sphagnum moss for a living is nice but its not hardly 
real anymore 
horner points to his uncle joe who builds wooden boats in 
waretown and was dubbed a piney by newspaper reporters who 
wrote about him and his craft 
joe turns out classic garveys made out of atlantic white 
cedar but he aint no piney horner says 
ask joe reid himself and he somewhat bashfully agrees 
growing up here we didnt know this would ever be called the 
pinelands he says we used to call it back in the woods 
although the lifestyle may wane action has been taken to 
protect the pinelands physical attributes which include a vast 
underground aquifer with an estimated 17 trillion gallons of pure 
water and rare cedar and pygmy pines in 1983 the united nations 
designated the region an international biosphere reserve 
the pinelands management plan protects a fragile core and gets 
increasingly less restrictive as it moves outward some areas are 
designated for agriculture others are forest areas that permit 
lowdensity residential and commercial development 
larger communities already within the reserve have been 
classified as regional growth areas where most future 
development will concentrate 
but the director of the state pinelands commission terrence 
moore emphasizes that no part of the reserve will see any major 
project such as a toxic waste dump that could taint the 
environment 
in the process of protecting such a vast tract in a rapidly 
developing region the state frustrated many landowners who faced 
restrictions on their ability to use or profit from their property

newsletters from the pinelands landowners society accused the 
state of trying to preserve land by essentially confiscating 
itmeanwhile taxes continue to be paid by landowners held 
hostage by the plan 
researchers continue to study the pinelands fragile ecosystem 
right down to the rare pine barrens tree frog and the curly grass 
fern 
medical research also has been conducted in the pinelands last 
year squibb corp microbiologists announced that a new family of 
microbiotics could be developed from pinelands soil 
but for all the pinelands beauty and benefits it is 
overshadowed as a tourist destination by the popular shore region 
and relatively few people take advantage of the reserve scattered 
through the scenic pinelands are attractions such as the historic 
batsto village a preserved ironmaking facility and a host of 
hiking trails and rivers for canoeing 
i dont think there is enough of an understanding in the state 
as to what the pinelands means and how important it is moore 
says most people think its just a boring flat landscape 
although the pinelands significance may not be widely and fully 
appreciated and its preservation fought by some the pinelands 
management does tanya have any advice for her sister 
stay in school and dont have kids until you finish school 
samantha jones a 17yearold graduate of beach channel high 
school in rockaway says the pregnant teenagers she knows really 
dont understand that once that babys born its going to be hard 
to feed them and clothe them and take em places and stuff like 
that and that they cant really do the things that they used to 
do 
but when asked if she used birth control she said sometimes 
but not really no but im supposed to start on it soon but not 
now 
katie trieller the clinical nurse specialist at woodmere says 
that kind of carelessness is common among teenagers of every 
stripe 
in the last five years with the media talking about herpes 
and aids adults are being more careful about sex she says 
its not affecting the adolescent population because they think 
theyre omnipotent thats their modus operandi im not going to 
get pregnant im not going to get vd 
sharon redman the valley stream teen who learned the hard way 
that she was not immune to pregnancy laments her abortioo kill a baby 
she says but i 
was only 17 at the time and still in school and i was working and 
my boyfriend was still in school at the time and his mother never 
knew shed probably be upset if she ever found out

editors note the 20th edition of dewey decimal 
classification which assigns numbers to library books is due out 
this year its a simple yet sophisticated system for organizing 
the worlds knowledge a system that a child can quickly learn 
while it must be updated from time to time some librarians 
maintain that deweys system will stand for all time 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
when melvil dewey envisioned how a library 
should be organized more than a century ago he couldnt have 
guessed how his system would be tested in the future 
he could hardly have foreseen in 1873 for example the 
invention of computers or the spread of aids and advancements in 
medical science such diseases engender 
or the highspeed lowcost printing presses that turn out so 
very many books each year since 1979 over a million volumes have 
been assigned dewey decimal numbers 
and with the publication this year of the 20th edition of 
deweys revolutionary system the first complete update in a 
decade just about the only constants of the dewey decimal 
classification are its basic structure and its publisher albanys 
forest press 
but that after all was deweys vision the strength and 
popularity of the system lie in its adaptability 
from a slant toward subjects a white middleclass american male 
in the 19th century might study european literature the bible 
and classical philosophy romance and germanic languages the 
natural sciences and history the system has assimilated other 
literatures and cultures to become the most popular method of 
organizing libraries in the world 
dewey had definitely a white protestant anglosaxon bias 
over the years as other editors have worked on the dewey there 
has been a constant effort to correct for this says arnold 
wajenberg principal cataloger and professor of library 
administration at the university of illinois in urbana 
wajenberg who is also on the advisory committee which oversees 
the deweys updates adds there is a very definite united states 
bias western european bias which is especially damaging as it 
becomes a worldwide classification 
familiar to most grade school children the dewey decimal system 
is used to organize libraries so books can be found easily and 
reports written languages learned curiosity quenched 
a book is assigned a number to the left of the decimal placing 
it in a general category to the right of the decimal it is 
assigned numbers that describe the particular book by adding or 
subtracting numbers a person can find other books on more specific 
or general topics new books can be squeezed into the librarys 
catalog in the same way 
the system is sophisticated enough to catalog millions of 
volumes and simple enough for a child to quickly learn so simple 
and sophisticated in fact that its editor john comaromi says it 
will stand for all time 
the thing is its powerful its really powerful he says 
it really fits human expression of ideas 
comaromi is head of the decimal classification division at the 
library of congress in washington dc where the dewey numbers 
are actually assigned 
translated into 34 languages from german to gujarati the dewey 
system is now used in 95 percent of the worlds libraries 
it stands in nearconstant transition with differences in the 
two most recent editions illustrating its changing face 
for example work began on the 19th edition in 1972 when it was 
published in 1979 crack cocaine was unknown and there was little 
published about drugs in general but as the next decade passed 
information piled up and social attitudes changed prompting major 
changes in the 20th edition aids had the same effect with its 
impact on epidemiology biochemistry even sociology comaromi says 
the rapid rise of computer technology even prompted a separate 
betweeneditions edition and will prompt future changes in the 
system itself as it is adapted for publication in computer form 
we have this tension between stability in libraries and then 
advancement and progress for people using the classification as the 
window into knowledge to the whole world of knowledge comaromi 
says if its going to be a window into knowledge its got to be 
current 
thats the sole purpose of forest press keeping the dewey in 
line with whats being published says executive director peter 
paulson 
paulson like melvil dewey is a former director of the new york 
state library one of the first libraries to adopt the system 
dewey developed his system in 1873 while a student at amherst 
college in massachusetts and worked on it the rest of his life 
in 1911 after resigning his post and moving to lake placid 
ny he founded forest press housing it at the lake placid club 
in the early 1970s the press moved to albany and earlier this 
year it was purchased by private informationsystems giant oclc of 
dublin ohio 
although there was at the time neither regular training for 
librarians nor a widely used classification system dewey based his 
system on others such as the scheme created by former us 
secretary of education william torrey harris for the st louis 
public library earlier in the 19th century 
while about 200000 libraries in more than 130 countries now use 
the dewey other systems compete for attention many major research 
libraries use the library of congress scheme the soviet union has 
its own system and the universal decimal classification derived 
in the 20th century from the dewey is popular in europe 
wajenberg says but the dewey is king for now 
its real effectiveness can be seen every time an adult enters 
the public library and finds it familiar years after first 
encountering the system for as paulson sums up this is a 
system for organizing all the worlds knowledge

eric idle like a knighterrant in comic 
armor has cut a swath from monty pythons flying circus in his 
native england to his new series for nbc nearly departed 
hes also found time recently for a role as berthold the 
fastest man alive in the adventures of baron munchausen and as 
passeportout phileas foggs womanchasing winebibbing french 
valet in the nbc miniseries around the world in 80 days 
in nearly departed which makes its debut monday april 10 
he and caroline mcwilliams play spirits only recently departed 
who try to dislodge the new occupants from their home 
its not polite comedy he says i seriously want those 
people out of the house 
idle was concerned with the lack of time available as he filmed 
six episodes of nearly departed 
it takes twice as much time to do comedy he says they 
dont give you enough lead time the writer was reworking the 
current script while he was writing the next weeks script i 
didnt do any writing but im allowed to rewrite and punch up so 
i put my bits in 
idle plays an english lecturer at the university of chicago who 
is killed with his wife by falling rock while on vacation instead 
of heaven or hell they go back to chicago to haunt their old home 
nearly departed is an original series but the concept has 
occasionally popped up in such past projects as blythe spirit 
and topper 
you get a chance to comment on people right in front of them 
and they cant hear you idle says we haunt stuart pankin and 
wendy schaal and their child jay lambert only the grandfather 
henderson forsythe can hear us 
its necessary to have someone you can communicate with or it 
doesnt relate you cant make the comedy work without that 
idle was in the forefront of british televisions golden age 
of comedy both as a writer and an actor he did three series 
with monty pythons ensemble of nonsense comedians and edited the 
spinoff books and cowrote and appeared in three monty python 
movies 
idles role in around the world in 80 days took him to 
london hong kong bangkok yugoslavia and the river kwai in 
thailand 
some railroad scenes were filmed on the river kwai railroad the 
infamous line built by allied prisoners of war in the movie the 
bridge over the river kwai 
every foot of the railroad represents someone who died idle 
says its beautiful and chilling at the same time 
idle notes that since around the world in 80 days was 
written by jules verne a frenchman passeportout receives a more 
sympathetic treatment than does the englishman fogg 
verne pictured fogg as the punctual englishman who must have 
his bath water at a certain temperature idle says while 
passeportout chases women and drinks wine 
the adventures of baron munchausen the new epic fantasy 
from columbia pictures was directed by terry gilliam another 
alumni of monty python john neville plays the title role robin 
williams plays the king of the moon 
munchausen was an 18thcentury character who used to boast 
about his exploits idle says the tales eventually became 
short stories that were favorites with children 
i play an actor who plays berthold in the play within a play 
i had my head shaved for six months in order to play berthold he 
has spent 20 years in prison on the moon 
idle describes the movie as an epic fantasy in the mold of the 
wizard of oz or a cecil b demille film 
he says its unlikely that the monty python team will get back 
together except perhaps for a special on the 20th anniversary 
members of the ensemble were gilliam idle john cleese terry 
jones michael palin and graham chapman

philip bosco may not be the busiest actor in the 
new york theater it just seems that way 
in nearly 35 years as a performer bosco has appeared in 99 
plays 61 of them in new york according to his extensive playbill 
biography he usually shuttles between broadways circle in the 
square and offbroadways roundabout theater company sometimes 
playing both in one season 
but his broad beefy irish face is not wellknown beyond the 
hudson river that may change with boscos critically praised 
performance in ken ludwigs farce lend me a tenor and his 
growing movie career in such films as children of a lesser god 
three men and a baby and working girl 
in lend me a tenor now on view at broadways royale 
theater bosco plays an apoplectic opera company manager in it he 
manages to turn frenzy into high hilarious art 
theater has always been boscos major focus and he has had 
seven good reasons to keep working steadily in it his children 
diane philip chris jenny lisa celia and john 
my wife nancy has been a wonderful manager the 
58yearold bosco says ive never been interested in money it 
has never mattered to me money was the cause of a great deal of 
difficulty in my family when i was a kid 
boscos father was in the small carnival business in jersey 
city nj his family would travel mostly during the summers 
throughout the northeast 
as a kid i used to work mostly in penny pitch bosco 
recalls then i began to work ball games where youd knock the 
bottles down then wheel games and when i got older even gambling 
joints it was not your average runofthemill childhood 
in catholic grammar school the nuns thought bosco was a pretty 
good reader its there he made his stage debut at the age of 12 
playing machevilli the cat in a little something called the fairy 
cobbler 
i was a big success because i played with my tail all through 
the show he says 
acting had made an impression on bosco in high school he 
appeared in the winter and spring plays entered elocutionary 
contests and was on the debating team he ended up at catholic 
university in washington and was a regular on the local washington 
theater circuit including stints at a summer theater in olney 
md and at fledgling arena stage 
in 1960 bosco and his wife moved to the new york area for good 
settling in teaneck nj where they still live 
his new york career did not have an auspicious beginning while 
rehearsing his first show measure for measure in central park 
his car was broken into and the belongings he was moving from 
washington were stolen 
but the play and bosco got good notices the actor landed an 
agent and his new york career was launched much of his early days 
were spent at lincoln center in its repertory company run by jules 
irving and herbert blau 
but when irving left lincoln center in 1973 i was out of work 
for about 18 months he recalls thats the longest ive ever 
been out of a job my wife went to work and i took parttime jobs 
outside the theater 
when you are in a reof get 
insulated and you get removed from the broadway scene he says 
youre not thought of for shows after a while people stop 
calling 
eventually people joseph papp in particular did bosco went 
back to lincoln center when papp took over there to appear with 
ruth gordon in george bernard shaws mrs warrens profession 
and then replaced raul julia in the threepenny opera since 
then bosco hasnt stopped working 
in lend me a tenor bosco costars with victor garber an 
actor he has worked with before in you never can tell and the 
devils disciple at circle in the square 
it was garber who suggested bosco for the role of the opera 
company manager to the shows producers and to director jerry zaks 
jerrys attention to detail is allencompassing bosco says 
nothing escapes him he will work on a thing until he is 
satisfied with it you work very hard pace is the critical thing 
you have to keep ahead of the audience all the time 
with farce bosco says you sometimes can go too fast 
i remember coming off and being annoyed with myself because i 
stumbled over three or four words in a scene he says usually 
its for lack of concentration but in this case it was because i 
was talking faster than i was thinking 
thats why comedy is so difficult to play when you make a 
mistake its so obvious you can really screw up in a drama where 
there are pauses and stops and no one would know that youve done 
it 
at the urging of his family and his agent bosco has made some 
15 to 20 films in the last five years the roles have been small 
but the salaries were enormous 
you cant make any money in the theater he says if you 
are lucky enough to get in a broadway show who knows how long its 
going to run 
was it hard to break into movies 
when you work in the theater they tend not to think of you 
for movies bosco says theyre just different communities and 
there arent too many peo for sunday april 9

to look at argentina is to look at a nation that 
has everything going for it but nothing is this is one of a 
series of periodic reports by the associated press on the economic 
social and political turbulence that has turned south america into 
a continent in crisis 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
the way things are today it is 
hard to believe that after world war ii argentina was one of the 
wealthiest nations in the world 
many argentines today date the steady decline of their economic 
fortunes since then to a day in february 1946 when gen juan 
domingo peron visited the central bank after being elected 
president and came out marveling at the pile of gold bars he saw 
inside 
you can hardly walk through the corridors he remarked 
argentines still cite those words in looking back 
they still have as high a standard of living as anyone in south 
america but they no longer are rich and many blame that on peron 
and his policies which still exerting influence long after his 
heyday and 14 years after his death 
he nationalized industries regulated wages and prices and work 
conditions expanded public employment and social welfare programs 
convinced millions of argentines that big government was best he 
created a political party that bears his name to carry out his 
vision 
today one worker of every six is employed by the government 
about 2 million overall in a population of 30 million the state 
subsidizes an estimated 300 companies the budget usually is in 
deficit natural resources go untapped private industry chafes at 
myriad regulations 
the state from 1945 to now has gotten a little bigger every 
year and it has long since reached the point where it can be 
sustained says juan jose cresto chairman of the department of 
economics at the university of buenos aires 
everyone realizes what the problem is but there is no general 
agreement on a solution says enrique szewach chief economist at 
the independent latin america research foundation 
the dominance of the state has been one constant in a political 
and economic maelstrom that has hampered development in a country 
blessed with resources 
over the years soldiers ousted civilians and democratic rule 
gave way to dictatorship the political and economic rules of the 
game changed quickly and often 
new regimes have tried to wipe out what came before rather than 
build on what may have been achieved 
economically currencyexchange rates have been undervalued and 
then overvalued business has been protected and then forced to 
face international competition wages and prices have been 
controlled and then set by market forces exports have been favored 
and then imports agriculture and then industry 
meanwhile the country slipped into decline despite fertile 
cropland and a temperate climate rich fishing grounds abundant 
deposits of oil natural gas and uranium rivers that can be tapped 
for hydroelectric power and a literate population not divided by 
language religion or race 
the gross domestic product has stagnated at about 80 billion 
for a decade annual per capita income dropped to the equivalent of 
1630 in 1988 from 1990 in 1980 according to the world bank 
raul alfonsin 62 an attorney and human rights leader has been 
president since december 1983 already he has outlasted all his 
predecessors since peron but his tenure has been rocky 
the military which unseated peron in 1955 arturo frondizi in 
1962 arturo illia in 1966 and the widow isabel peron in 1976 has 
had minor revolts in its ranks three times in the past two years 
human rights groups and other critics maintain the military is 
agitating again for political power 
the radical left also has not given up despite the brutal 
crackdown on subversives beginning with isabel perons government 
in 1974 and carried on by the 197683 military regime in which at 
least 8963 argentine civilians were arrested never seen again and 
presumed executed according to the findings of a commission set up 
by alfonsin but human rights groups among them amnesty 
international estimate the number of people who disappeared 
desaparecidos at 10000 to 30000 
few expect any outbreak of violence such as that recently in 
venezuela but if it happens the spark might come from an economy 
that neither soldiers nor civilians have been able to control 
inflation has been at tripledigit rates in 13 of the past 14 
years climbing from 2439 percent in 1974 to 688 percent in 1984 
and down to 38770 percent last year unemployment and 
underemployment stand at a combined 14 percent the austral 
currency is devalued every month and wages often fail to keep up 
with inflation

looming over everything is the nearly 59billion foreign debt 
for which there is almost nothing to show the military borrowed 
heavily to balance the budget in the late 1970s 
it also used the money to buy military equipment build highways 
through buenos aires subsidize militaryrun industries and inject 
money into chronically inefficient stateowned companies it used 
some of the money to play host to the world soccer cup tournament 
in 1978 
alfonsin has borrowed mostly to pay the interest on the debt 
but by his own admission has paid only 50 percent of the interest 
due argentinas international credit rating now is classified as 
substandard and is on the verge dropping to value impaired 
because of noncompliance with interest payments 
debt repayment now costs 6 billion a year and consumes or 
would if the government paid it more than onehalf of total 
export earnings the central bank is 25 billion in arrears 
in human terms people who used to drive to work now take the 
bus or subway home ownership for many is out of the question 
vacations are shorter and closer to home university graduates are 
emigrating in increasing numbers to europe or the united states 
wage strikes by public employees are common and schoolchildren 
stay home mail doesnt get delivered businesmen go to work in car 
pools 
the general labor confederation has staged 13 general strikes 
since alfonsin became president 
the 4millionmember confederation which was forged by peron 
is lending considerable support to the peronist partys candidate 
carlos menem in the presidential elections set for may 14 
perhaps alfonsins biggest accomplishment has been to hold 
together a fragile democracy and fractious republic for five years 
a main goal he has said is to hand over political power to an 
elected successor in december that has not happened since 1928 
the biggest failure of alfonsins military predecessor was the 
war with britain over the falkland islands the malvinas to 
argentines 
alfonsins biggest failure has been the economy 
he has tried without much success to cut the federal budget 
reorganize the banking sector lower trade barriers increase tax 
collections and sell the state telephone company and the national 
airline aerolineas argentinas 
alfonsins second major antiinflation plan collapsed in 
february in the weeks since the austral has plummeted by 59 
percent against the us dollar cars valued in australs now seem 
halfpriced to those with dollars apartments selling for dollars 
doubled in cost for buyers with australs 
national elections raise the prospect of more instability 
menem the frontrunner pledges to dramatically improve workers 
wages and hints he might not continue payments on the foreign debt 
he talks vaguely of a productive revolution to spur growth and 
a social pact to resolve tensions 
his main challenger eduardo angeloz of alfonsins radical civic 
union pledges to balance the budget attract foreign investment 
and sell off state companies despite the opposition of unions 
compounding matters the election could wind up in the electoral 
college where conservative thirdparty candidate alvaro alsogaray

portauprince haiti ap in a roofless burnedout church 
the congregation sings hymns in creole about death and crushed 
dreams 
they kill us in the street they kill us in our homes they 
kill us inside church 
the words flowed from 200 or so worshipers during mass at st 
jean bosco roman catholic church in the midst of slum 
the problems of our country make us die like animals 
democracy democracy 
in september thugs with machetes guns and spikes stormed into 
st jean bosco during mass killing 13 people and wounding 70 
others before setting the church afire with gasoline a week later 
on sept 17 rankandfile soldiers revolted and put lt gen 
prosper avril in power 
they overthrew lt gen henri namphy and stirred hopes for 
democracy at last in haiti 
the caribbeanisland nation has known almost nothing but brutal 
dictatorships since winning independence from france in 1804 the 
first slave state to become a nation 
today six months after avril took over and three years after 
dictator jeanclaude baby doc duvalier flew to exile in france 
there is disillusionment over the pace of promised democratic 
reforms while allegations of humanrights violations continue 
but avril who holds a law degree has made some albeit slow 
progress toward his pled an 
elected government his government maintains democracy is the only 
path for the poorest country in the western hemisphere 
weve had dictatorships for 184 years and we are still the 
least developing nation in latin america so something is wrong 
with how we governed said foreign minister serge elie charles in 
an interview democracy is not a choice its an imperative 
in february avril approved the formation of an independent 
council to oversee eventual elections and he recently restored 291 
articles of the 1987 constitution suspended in june by namphy but 
37 articles that mostly restricted the armys role were not revived 
because avril said they were inconsistent with a de facto 
government 
you cant expect this government to behave like a 
democratically elected government sociologist leopold berlanger 
head of the haitian research and development institute said in an 
interview avril is a product of the system 
the only thing we have to expect is that he assures a secure 
fair and honest democratic process 
the 50yearold avril was duvaliers close financial adviser and 
people still associate him with the old regime many charge he is 
making reforms merely to win back 70 million in us economic 
assistance the aid was frozen nov 29 1987 after goonsquads 
killed 34 people voting in the countrys first election in 30 years 
the us state department has said it wont renew aid until 
democratic government is in place but congress could release some 
funds in the meantime as an incentive 
with about 80 percent of the countrys 55 million people living 
in dire poverty haiti desperately needs help 
witholding aid has been very negative said the foreign 
minister the socialeconomic factors have worsened so we cannot 
say how these measures have in any way advanced democracy 
this year labor strikes and sporadic demonstrations broke out 
in portauprince the capital and in the provinces with demands 
for avril to step down 
americas watch and other human rights groups say abuses and 
arbitrary arrests by the army and paramilitary groups continue to 
be made of people in peasant organizations labor unions and church 
groups 
the basic human rights situation has not changed said 
robert duval who was a political prisoner under jean claude 
duvalier and today runs a human rights group in the last weeks 
we have found one to two bodies a night as a result of the 
political situation 
duvaliers feared private militia the tonton macoute was 
disbanded after jeanclaude fled and some were integrated into the 
7000member army but they were chased out by soldiers who brought 
avril to power 
although disorganized the army wields considerable power 
youre not going to get to power if theres not a reasonable 
understanding with those guys said presidenial hopeful marc 
bazin a former finance minister and world bank economist you 
would be killed or disappear one morning 
optimism waned a month after avril took office when the soldiers 
who put him in power were jailed accused of plotting a coup three 
months later they were released no explanation was given 
but the tide turned in late december when avril gave franck 
romain the notorious mayor of portauprince safe passage to the 
dominican republic which shares the island of hispaniola with 
haiti 
romain a retired colonel was believed to have orchestrated the 
church massacre and was implicated in the one against voters in 
1987 
giving romain safe conduct showed the tendency of the 
government to preserve the status quo and encourage the 
duvalierists to stay on not to pursue the murderers of nov 29 or 
the church massacre said louis dejoie ii son of popular 
industrialist who lost to francois duvalier jeanclaudes father 
in the disputed 1957 election 
fears also abound that elections would again be disrupted or 
rigged as was believed the case in the elections jan 17 1988 
when frightened voters stayed home and leslie manigat came to power 
amid allegations of fraud manigat was overthrown by namphy five 
months later 
international pressure would have to be great so they cant 
repeat the events of november or of januarys sham election said 
sociologist hubert de ronceray the runnerup in the 1988 election 
about a dozen opposition parties and an array of organizations 
have emerged since 1986 but are divided 
the democratic process depends on confidence building between 
the army and civilians a western diplomat said civilians have 
to trust the army to take its role but not to take control and you 
have to have the willingness of the existing government the 
quietude of the far left and the tolerance of the far right 
no one predicts what will happen 
the communist party the grassroots popular church and 
leftist unions are influential with peasants and the poor these 
groups want avril to step down and allow a coalition government to 
govern until elections 
many say avril is caught in the middle 
he risks being overthrown if he doesnt make enough progress 
he risks it if he does said the diplomat speaking on condition 
of anonymity so hes trying to maintain an equilibrium

rooftops 
 
lets hear it for the septuagenarian film director 
charles crichton who made the lavender hill mob and other 
comedy classics scored an academy award nomination at 78 for his 
rollicking a fish named wanda samuel fuller pickup on south 
street is starting another action movie at 77 now robert wise 
74 has a new film rooftops 
its not in the range of wises west side story to which it 
is inevitably compared but rooftops is handsomely produced 
directed with kinetic energy and skillfully acted by a youthful 
cast 
amazingly rooftops was produced on the streets and of new 
york city for 8 million wises last movie star trek the 
motion picture reportedly cost 50 million 
like west side story rooftops deals with urban warfare 
the setting is manhattans lower east side where homeless 
teenagers live on top of abandoned tenements and earn a meager 
living by scrounging used plumbing and auto parts they are at odds 
with punk gangs and on a more sinister level the venomous drug 
dealers 
a straightarrow loner known only as t jason gedrick pumps 
iron at his watertower apartment and tries to stay out of trouble 
then he falls for elena troy beyer a virtuous girl who has been 
trapped into serving as lookout for her drugdealing cousin lobo 
eddie velez conflict builds to a violent showdown with t and a 
few allies mismatched against lobo and his thugs 
while not a musical per se rooftops is scored to continuous 
rock music by david stewart of the eurythmics and michael kamen of 
pink floyd plenty of lively choreography is provided by the 
capoeira an afrobrazilian exercise that combines karate with 
ballet 
wises direction is a marvel capturing the action while drawing 
credible performances the stumbling point is terence brennans 
script which lacks surprise and explores no new ground in the 
struggle of survival in the bigcity jungle 
jason gedrick supplies a strong sullen presence as the hero 
and eddie velez is appropriately terrifying as the heavy troy 
beyers unspoiled beauty and dramatic depth indicate a promising 
future young alexis cruz provides bright moments as the

sing 
 
generations of brooklyn high school students have enjoyed one of 
academias most popular traditions sing the school song and dance 
competition between grades at individual schools such as erasmus 
hall and midwood was a joyous and spirited event it bubbled like 
the 2 cents plain at jahns ice cream parlor 
unfortunately richard baskins recreation of that spirited show 
in sing is as flat as a stale egg cream it was written by dean 
pitchford and has the same situational formulas as his fame 
and footloose 
it stars two newcomers peter dobson and jessica steen who are 
appealing enough but lack the power and talent to truly carry a 
movie louise lasser heavier and less frenzied than her mary 
hartman mary hartman days costars as steens mom lorraine 
bracco someone to watch over me with a heavy hollywoodstyle 
brooklyn accent portrays a streettough teacher who returns to her 
community 
singer patti labelle a soldiers story is the only cast 
member who has enough high energy to dominate the screen and infuse 
some excitement but her explosive talent is little used in her 
role as a teacher who also works with the sing committee 
sing is centered around the threatened closing of an 
imaginary brooklyn high school where the competition has been a 
community tradition students faculty and members of the 
neighborhood rally to keep the school open so the skits can be put 
on and to retain a way of life 
at the same time a local punk named dominic dobson is forced 
into being a sing leader by his teacher miss lombardo bracco 
who is trying to turn him from a life of crime dominic falls in 
love with hannah steen a good student and good girl and its 
like water mixing with oil 
the movie is sprinkled with enough perky songs to fill an album 
pitchford wrote all the lyrics with music by tom snow rhett 
lawrence patrick leonard jonathan cain martin page tom kelly 
desmond child diane warren and richard marx however there are 
more misses than hits 
the craig zadan production for tristar pictures leaves one 
thirsting for west side story or even to sir with love 
and the producers might take lessons from the former brooklyn 
students who poured so much talent into the sing competitions

imagine warner home video vhsbeta 7995 rated pg 
 
imagine bills itself as the definitive film portrait of 
musicianpoetpop icon john lennon its too early to judge this 
film biography as definitive but it is certainly a comprehensive 
thoughtful and deeply moving study of the most complicated beatle 
produced by david l wolper and directed by andrew solt the 
film is a compilation of more than 100 interviews with lennon 
himself yoko ono his first wife cynthia sons julian and sean 
the aunt who raised him manager brian epstein and dozens of other 
lesser characters 
the wellpaced production wolper and solt previously 
collaborated on this is elvis contains footage of lennons 
early years in liverpool the beatles first success in hamburg 
west germany the groups phenomenal us tour the drugs the 
breakup life with yoko alternating between public and private 
glimpses of the artist 
highlights include a combative and hilarious exchange 
between lennon and cartoonist al capp and a poignant performance 
of the song imagine shortly after lennon wrote it 
the film wisely does not end abruptly with lennons 
assassination in 1980 but moves beyond showing what his music 
meant to an entire generation the soundtrack with nearly three 
dozen songs is stunning

the thin blue line hbo home video vhsbeta 8999 
 
errol morris singular documentary about the circumstances that 
led to a man being convicted of murdering a dallas police officer 
and condemned to death is at the very least harrowing in its 
implications 
before you say it couldnt happen to you read on 
it was thanksgiving weekend in 1976 when randall dale adams a 
day laborer with no criminal record fell in with richard harris a 
16yearold juvenile delinquent they spent the day hanging out 
adams says they split up at 10 pm harris testified that they 
were together at midnight when officer robert wood died during a 
routine traffic stop shot to death by a gun harris had stolen 
harris boasted about killing a cop to friends but when he 
fingered adams for the crime he was believed adams who has 
maintained he is innocent landed on death row his sentence later 
was commuted to life in prison 
whats harrowing is the lowkey way in which morris reconstructs 
the crime offers the testimony of witnesses and conducts 
interviews with the principals very gradually you realize that 
randall dale adams got railroaded by police and prosecutors with 
the best intentions in the world they knew he was guilty it was 
just a case of fitting the facts to conform to that truth 
rashomon this isnt but powerful and persuasive and 
chilling it is 
as a result of morris critically acclaimed effort adams 
conviction was overturned 
in december a texas state judge recommended that adams receive 
a new trial or be set free on feb 24 texas refused for the 
eighth time to parole him and scheduled its next review for 
december 1990 
but on march 1 the texas court of criminal appeals ordered a 
new trial for him saying a witness had lied and a prosecutor 
suppressed evidence and on march 23 the dallas county texas 
district attorney dropped the case against adams citing a lack of 
evidence 
you know texas wanted to execute me in 79 adams said in 
december so each day past that is a day that im alive

lyle lovett and his large band curbmca lyle lovett 
 
so besides large just what sort of band is this 
listen to the albums instrumental opener the blues walk 
and you might think large band is just a clever name for 1940s 
big band but wait next comes here i am an odd comic turn 
combining spokenword passages with a bluesrock refrain now skip 
ahead a few tracks and hear that unmistakable country sound 
so what sort of band is this why its a 
jazzbluesswingrampbcountrywesternrock band of course and the 
individual songs on this fun quirky album are just as tough to 
categorize 
i married her just because she looks like you comes closest 
to following a standard country formula but its wry lyrics are a 
cut above that standard good intentions is a sort of talkin 
blues number that could easily come from david brombergs songbook 
then theres what do you do which starts out as a sassy blues 
number turns into a barpickup conversation lovett in duet with 
vocalist francine reed and slides into the 1936 standard the 
glory of love 
tying all of this together is lovetts peculiar combination of 
cynicism and romanticism that adds an edge to his iloveyou songs 
i know you know and a softness to his shedonemewrong songs 
once is enough 
this texans country roots come out more strongly as the album 
plays on the world could do without lovetts cover of stand by 
your man but his reworking of the traditional farther along 
into the lostlove ballad if you were to wake up has a simple 
charm 
as for the large band it adapts to the needs of each song 
appearing in various sizes and combinations of instruments 
including fiddles cello and saxophones as well as guitars 
keyboards and drums more than large its grand

wiener blut sire falco 
 
falco the onetime classical music child prodigy who had a no 
1 hit with the unusual rock me amadeus single in 1986 has 
returned after a twoyear hiatus with wiener blut 
the record is chock full of the synthesizerbased pop rock so in 
vogue today with its fabricated drums and overblown melodies but 
at its base wiener blut rocks solidly surprisingly 
on side 1 the austrianborn falco nee johann holzel 
collaborates with the dutch brothers rob and ferdi holland the 
producerarrangercomposer duo that was responsible for rock me 
amadeus 
the result is highly orchestral almost baroque pop lush 
synthesizer lines backed by a heavy dance beat and punctuated by 
stinging guitar solos the title cut best typifies this style 
while untouchable incorporates the television shows theme into 
the melody and satellite to satellite with its 
technologycansaveus lyrics combines a spacy synthesizer with a 
good rock beat 
side 2 leaves the holland brothers behind falco takes charge on 
most cuts and the result is a simpler more satisfying set of 
tunes with more of a message 
walls of silence the best cut on wiener blut is a slow 
rocker dealing with the inability of nations to communicate the 
wall of the title represents that inability probably best 
symbolized by the berlin wall 
falco keeps the beat rocking steady with shes my solid 
booze and wie sand am himalaya he even checks in with a 
spirited version of steely dans 1972 hit do it again that 
features falcos best singing on the record 
falco is often silly and vapid thats too bad because when he 
wants to he makes some pretty fair rock n roll heres hoping he 
can stick to the beat

impressions of a spanish film star on her 
first glimpse of hollywood 
i am a little afraid of this city it is very special i think 
it is too much for me too much it is very big lot of cars i 
drive but i dont want to drive here it is impossible to live 
here without car impossible to work 
its hard to imagine carmen maura afraid of anything her fiery 
temperament is one of the many delights of women on the verge of 
a nervous breakdown spains entry as foreign language film in 
the academy award sweepstakes 
the film the director pedro almodovar and maura have elicited 
rave reviews from american critics and the moviegoing public has 
responded accordingly the movie has grossed 46 million which is 
big money for a subtitled film these days 
women on the verge has been compared to the great screwball 
comedies of the late 1930s hollywood maura says she is not 
surprised that americans like the film 
when i started to work with pedro 10 years ago we had a 
situation and a relationship that was very special she recalled 
i said to him oh pedro dont worry because in time the 
americans will understand you 
i am very proud of pedro almodovar he is very genuine his 
sense of humor is very american sometimes and my sense of humor 
also the spanish have a lot of sense of humor the directors in 
spain dont normally make the kinds of films like pedro makes they 
make films about the war about the poor no colors no rich 
persons pedro is different 
the almodovarmaura partnership goes back to when he was working 
for the telephone company in madrid and she was a mostly unemployed 
actress the dark beauty who speaks in bursts of slightly flawed 
english remarked 
the first moment when i meet pedro i am a little actress and 
he is very young he had no money he had nothing he works with 
the telefonica and with little parts in the theater he work with 
super8 movies and he make jokes every day 
he has an imagination really really special he began to 
speak to me and i began to speak to him about life about women 
about men i say to him pedro you must get away from the super8 
and go to the big film so we make the first film during two years 
on the weekends without money without makeup without nothing it 
was a very very funny movie 
it was called pepi luci bom and other girls like mom a 
title that set the tone for almodovars film career born in a 
small village of la mancha in 1951 he had come to madrid at the 
age of 17 worked at various humdrum jobs while indulging in the 
burgeoning world of underground literature pop music and movies 
at one time he played in a rock band called almodovar and mcnamara 
carmen maura was born to a conservative madrid family in 1945 
after a catholic education she worked in an art gallery while 
seeking work in theater productions she met pedro when she was 
starring in satres dirty hands and he had a oneline role 
after their first movie she became a tv talkshow hostess on the 
popular esta noche tonight program 
almodovar first attracted attention outside of spain with his 
third film dark habits in which maura played a bongoplaying 
nun in his other films she portrayed a harried housewife what 
have i done to deserve this a psychiatrist matador and a 
flamboyant transsexual law of desire the directors 
reputation continued to grow then he exploded with women on the 
verge of a nervous breakdown which opened last seasons new york 
film festival 
it is the first time that a spanish film has made as much 
money as an american film maura said in this case we have the 
money like rambo like spielberg it is the most successful film 
in the history of the spanish film the people see the film three 
times four times and they go with the whole family they repeat 
they laugh a lot the film is in four cinemas one year it has a 
long life in spain 
i dont understand exactly what happened with this film the 
cinema is a mystery sometimes it happens i dont understand it

murthada haddad one of iraqs emerging 
sculptors spent six years fighting the iranians in the gulf war 
and the horrors he and other artists experienced at the front have 
had a dramatic impact on iraqi art 
i saw too many people die in the war and they come out in my 
work it was a very very painful experience said haddad who 
lost his studio and foundry in the southern port of basra when it 
took a direct hit from iranian shellfire during fierce assaults on 
the city 
six months after the august ceasefire there are few signs of 
the conflict on the streets of baghdad but the battle scars are 
visible in the capitals museums galleries and studios 
gone are the idyllic landscapes the bedouins on horseback the 
scenes from the marshes and the mountains all traditional 
subjects artists favored before the war began in september 1980 in 
their place are searing sculptures and paintings that reflect the 
carnage the artists witnessed 
three sculptures by haddad displayed at a recent oneman 
exhibition show small bronze figures sitting twisted and bound 
covering their faces the group is called prisoner of war 
a statue commemmorating a missile attack was designed by 
muhammed ghani whose whimsical statues inspired by the legend of 
1001 nights are baghdad landmarks a girl in the statue has 
two shattered stumps for legs 
a painting entitled war and peace which won plastic surgeon 
ala hussein bashiir the gold medal at the baghdad international 
festival shows a man leaving the cold metallic bonds of his 
military uniform to float among the clouds 
the war turned the work of most iraqi artists into art that 
has something to say not art for decoration the 50yearold 
bashiir said in an interview they may use the same style but 
the subject has changed 
painter shakir hassan 64 remembers his first visit to the 
front after a fierce battle when i saw basra and the front lines 
i understood the dramatic results of war 
when the town itself is burned by bombardment it means the 
existence of things is destroyed not just humans but walls 
paintings as well 
one side of his pyramid painting alfaw created after the 
iraqi army recaptured the strategic southern peninsula in april 
1988 after two years of iranian occupation is filled with brightly 
colored triangles and squares 
i was using the cultural symbols from arab and islamic art 
like old wall decorations from mosques to represent the strength 
of the culture he said rebuilding them means peace 
artists and critics expect more powerful work to emerge once 
artists in the 1 millionstrong army iraq still keeps in the field 
get back to their easels 
in the past the school that was dominant in iraqi art was the 
calligraphy school said prominent critic jabra ibrahim jabra 
with the war there was a reaction against that 
the younger artists are very powerful in their statements 
using rough colors a lot of paint taking a lot of liberty with 
the canvas theyre trying to say something very personal and very 
agonized 
one strong theme that has emerged in the warinfluenced art is 
the enduring legacy of the civilizations that prospered along the 
tigris and euphrates rivers artists said 5000 years of history in 
the region was a source of inspiration against the onslaught by 
ayatollah ruhollah khomeinis army 
we have an ancient civilization ghani said islam is 
relatively young its only been here for the past 1400 years 
khomeini wanted humanity to go backwards and we didnt want to go 
backwards 
haddad used a group of people inspired by ancient mespotamian 
wall reliefs to show the shock induced by the fall of faw in 1986 
the bearded figures stare off in the distance mouths agape hands 
crossed over their stomachs 
iraqi artists point to the generous checks the government 
continued handing out during the war as another important 
wellspring of their work 
our public isnt quite like the public in new york and los 
angeles in that it wants to acquire paintings for prestige said 
jabra thats coming but not yet 
culture and information minister latif nisayyif jasim visits 
most exhibitions and any artist who has had a oneman show is 
eligible for government commissions 
everything from the massive new basra airport to conference 
rooms at the state oil marketing authority are hung with original 
artwork 
a gold medal at baghdads international exhibition carried a 
15000 prize while travel abroad is banned for most iraqis 
artists are allowed to leave to organize exhibitions of their work 
the government has realized that giving artists a free hand was 
an indication of the vitality of the nation jabra said 
most iraqi artists are very welltodo joked bashiir who 
is getting government support to organize a fall showing of his 
work at the institute du monde arabe in paris they earn 10 times 
more than doctors 
president saddam hussein is known for ruthlessly eliminating his 
enemies and the staterun press is heavily censored still 
artists stress that they have a free hand in their work but with a 
limited private market official tastes tend to dominate and 
artists generally laud the governments tough standards in 
selecting the works they commission 
part of the quality comes from the countrys highly competitive 
art colleges 
the crude nature of some of the statues emerging from the war 
has been condemned in basra for example a massive statue on a 
freeway interchange shows an iraqi infantryman brandishing a sword 
after chopping open the neck of a massive iranian shark 
very few of us are very happy with our public monuments 
jabra said however he added the arts are flourishing its 
miraculous

lou reeds new album new york has been 
receiving much critical attention because of its unsparing lyrics 
about urban blight 
he has been asked about lyrical content so much he wonders why 
writers dont go beyond the subject and concern themselves with the 
poetry in which the lyrics are expressed 
the opening of romeo had juliette caught between the 
twisted stars the plotted lines the faulty map that brought 
columbus to new york youve got to admit thats a great opening 
line reed says forget about what it means and think of the 
flow of words i wish people would notice dont you get some kind 
of pleasure when you listen to the language 
its the first song i wrote for the album it was the standard 
for the rest we had the luxury to go in and test out the studio 
we tested it with romeo and kept the cut we did for the record 
reed talked about his music in an interview at the american 
sound studio where he and a band were rehearsing for a tour that 
will include an engagement at broadways st james theater 
thats a distance from reeds early scruffy days in the velvet 
underground the group was discovered in 1967 in new yorks 
underground rock scene by the late pop artist andy warhol who 
promoted them it remained menacingly nonmainstream and didnt 
become commercial later though it became a role model for punk 
rock working solo since 1970 reed has had only one pop hit 
walk on the wild side in 1973 
next november reed and john cale who also left the velvet 
underground in 1970 will present an evening of songs in tribute to 
warhol at the brooklyn academy of music 
when he was cutting new york as lyrically streettough as 
ever but accepted in these days of rappers and u2 reed wasnt 
expecting media attention 
you can tell from listening we werent thinking in terms of 
radio airplay he said 
dirty blvd begins pedro lives out of the wilshire hotel 
he looks out a window without glass the walls are made of 
cardboard newspapers on his feet his father beats him cause hes 
too tired to beg 
sire records wanted to market a single but reed said he wasnt 
the type of person to sell singles i pushed for dirty blvd 
because i thought the single should at least be representative of 
the album look what happened he said 
new york is selling better than any previous lou reed album 
and is fast climbing the charts 
a liner note on new york says you cant beat 2 guitars 
bass drum the sound of the record was important to reed that 
the words be understandable and the guitars sound real 
even though segovia said an electric guitar is an abomination 
what i like about an electric guitar is it can have all this body 
from the wood in it he said we had as one of our goals to 
record it so it comes across that way and doesnt sound like a 
synthesizer thinned out and high endy 
one thing was not to have too many instruments we wanted my 
solos on guitar to be thick and beautiful we wanted everything to 
be heard of course when theres not too many parts theres 
nothing to hide behind any mediocrity is heard 
his singing is basically talking and has always been that way 
in my mind i would like to sing like otis redding or al green i 
cant so i had to find a way i could use my range in my style 
about the songs reed said he doesnt know why he wrote them 
i didnt sit and say im going to write about this and this 
i had pieces of songs whatever i get first i cant change 
he said i can juggle around with later things but the first 
phrase or line of melody or title i get for a song i cant change 
it i had the title dime store mystery for 20 years my wife 
sylvia said when are you going to finish it it came up on this 
album 
i like that song a lot it had an odd effect on us when it was 
recorded we were taken someplace else i cant say where that 
someplace was 
i guess people dont expect much out of records they keep 
staying on the plot and asking who do you know in a welfare 
hotel dime store mystery dispenses with plot 
reed said what the album is really about is the use of language 
thats what im really getting off on there are phrases in there 
as good as anything ive ever written 
it is pretty funny some of it i thought its not endlessly 
grim 
reed took part in a benefit concert paul simon organized at 
madison square garden to buy and equip a medical van to visit new 
york welfare hotels paul bought one with the proceeds of 
graceland every penny from this concert went to get another 
one 
reed has been told that last great american whale from new 
york will be on a greenpeace album released in the soviet union 
when hes asked if thats a real indian myth he says it is now 
its an american indianjewish myth in europe all the great myths 
have been taken wouldnt it be nice if we could still write a myth 
and do it well enough so it held up i wanted to try to do that 
why not 
asked about solutions to the bigcity problems limned on new 
york reed says we only had an hour well get into solutions 
on vol 2 maybe

it is somehow fitting that when saul bellow must 
choose between an overstuffed chair and a straightbacked one for 
an interview he selects the less comfortable seat 
i write in a chair as hard as this he said with a smile 
sitting upright in the rigid seat and looking perfectly at ease 
bellow nobel prize winner pulitzer prize winner the only 
author to win three national book awards has racked up more than 
enough laurels on which to comfortably rest but at 73 he shows no 
indication hes ready to relax his 14th book a theft 
penguin 695 is now in bookstores 
this reluctance to get too comfortable is all a part of what 
bellow calls fighting the nobel curse the popular conception 
that writers produce little work of merit after winning the 
granddaddy of all literature prizes 
since receiving the nobel in 1976 he has published the 
following two novels the deans december and more die of 
heartbreak a collection him with his foot in his mouth and 
other stories and the latest work a novella 
although most critics rank these works below such masterpieces 
as the adventures of augie march mr sammlers planet and 
humboldts gift they are by no means considered secondrate 
and the new a theft shows bellow still willing to take risks 
a theft breaks ground on two levels it is his first long 
work to have a female protagonist and it is the first time an 
author of bellows stature has opted to publish a book in paperback 
without it first appearing in hardcover 
bellow is a small man with an unassuming manner and low voice 
that contrast nicely with his august reputation at an interview in 
the drawing room of the private lotos club he answered questions 
thoughtfully but with little hesitation as if he had already 
considered them 
the snowy hair aristocratic nose and space between the front 
teeth are familiar from book jackets what is unexpected is a 
tiredness about the eyes that may be old age or simply that he had 
risen early enough to appear on a morning talk show that day 
his novellas heroine is clara velde a middleaged publishing 
executive dubbed the czarina of fashion writing for all her 
sophistication and park avenue polish clara we quickly learn has 
never forgotten her smalltown indiana roots and her strict 
protestant upbringing 
nor has she forgotten her first love ithiel regler a kind of 
freelance global political analyst who appears regularly before 
congressional committees and on network news programs claras four 
husbands cant hold a candle to him an emerald engagement ring 
ithiel once gave her is the subject of the books title 
bellow dismissed the critical fuss over his use of a female 
protagonist as so much topical ferment and pointed out that many of 
his short stories have been about women 
it just struck me forcibly so i did it there was no planning 
about it no public policy involved he said i wrote it the 
way i write everything 
clara is described in the opening paragraph as an energetic 
woman with a head unusually big her blue eyes exceptionally 
large grew prominent when she brooded the nose was small 
ancestrally a north sea nose 
such exacting descriptions of characters features is a bellow 
trademark a minor character in augie march has a 
campaigners red in the face a powerful bite in his jaw and 
goldcrowned teeth green cockeyes and soft short hair altogether 
napoleonic tommy wilhelm the protagonist of seize the day 
has a big round face a wide flourishing red mouth stump 
teeth 
its a lifelong thing for me bellow said of his fascination 
with faces as soon as i meet somebody it just comes over me 
ive never finished with that certainly children do that 
immediately before you have any concept of what it means you have 
very powerful impressions of who people are secret communications 
by the way their ears stand out on their heads their grimaces a 
nose can tell you volumes 
he is asked if he considers the impetuous clara a romantic as 
so many of his characters are 
i dont know whether shes a romantic character or a 
passionate character the two have become somewhat confused these 
days i do think of her as a very passionate person i also think 
of her as having an intelligence and force said bellow who like 
many writers speaks of his characters as if they were acquaintances 
rather than products of his imagination 
well its often like that he said when this is pointed out 
to him are these people outright inventions well sometimes 
they are but theyre never what they were originally its the 
imagination poured into the person that makes them worth reading 
about 
bellow is most firmly associated with chicago where he has 
lived most of his life since he arrived with his family from 
quebec canada when he was 9 the city from its depressionera 
slums to its modern north shore highrises is the setting of most 
of his fiction however a theft like a few other works takes 
place in new york where he lived for a time early in his writing 
career 
bellow said the debut of a theft as a paperback original is 
his way of protesting what he considers the thirdclass treatment 
given fiction in magazines these days where short stories are 
increasingly scarce to make room for more articles on sex 
politics sports entertainment and other distractions 
literature is antidistraction he said it is absorption 
and forgetfulness 
when two magazines rejected a theft as being too long to 
publish bellow began casting about for another way to get it into 
print he said he probably had enough weight to persuade a 
publisher to put out the manuscript in hardcover but he didnt 
want a reader to have to spend 15 or more for a work that ran 
barely 100 pages his agent peddled it to penguin and the result 
is a book with a 150000 first printing that will see a far larger 
audience than it would have in a magazine 
bellow will publish another novella this fall in the same format 
and hopes his move will inspire other authors to dig similar 
manuscripts out of desk drawers he is at work on a third novella 
lately its strongly appealed to me he said of the form 
maybe because of my age theres a certain number of things i 
want to write and i dont want to invest many years in writing 
them at great length i also have a feeling that a great many 
people today also want things to be more compressed 
with a selfdeprecating laugh bellow offered up this assessment 
of his work a great many people seem to view me as a very good 
writer who is very difficult to read 
a wry observation from a man who selects the hard chair over the 
soft one whose fans do no less recognizing that less substantial 
writers are too cushy to provide support over the long haul

singer eddy raven is working on a streak 
of four straight no 1 country music records 
but the biggest song with which hes been associated was one he 
wrote that took nine years to become a hit and then became a 
country classic thank god for kids recorded by the oak ridge 
boys 
the 44yearold raven is at the peak of a 20year recording 
career his till you cry recently reached no 1 on at least 
one of the national country charts joining his earlier top ranked 
shine shine shine im gonna get you and joe knows how to 
live 
since october 1987 each of his singles has been no 1 his 
first no 1 record was i got mexico in 1984 several other 
songs of his have been close to the top spot 
but it was the emotional lyrics of thank god for kids that 
probably will make it the most enduring song of his prolific 
singing and songwriting career the impassioned tune sold 1 million 
copies for the oak ridge boys in five weeks in 1982 and has become 
the theme song for various antichild abuse campaigns in the seven 
years since 
theres stone reality in that song raven said in an 
interview everybody whos had kids has had koolaid on the couch 
every father has tried to fly a kite and kids ask thousands of 
questions 
he composed the song at home in 15 minutes in 1973 inspired by 
his 3yearold son who said he wanted to help his father write 
about mickey mouse and big bird 
raven himself recorded the song in 1976 but only as the bside 
of a record music industry executives told him the subject matter 
just wasnt what country music fans wanted 
i was told country folks dont care about santa claus and 
christmas that they are interested in love and barrooms raven 
said i tried for three years to get that song put out they said 
no 
finally the song reached the hands of the oak ridge boys who 
made it a hit and one of their most requested tunes 
as a singer he recently released the album best of eddy 
raven his top selling lp to date due out by summer on the new 
universal label is another album temporary sanity 
we wanted the title to at least stir some excitement from 
people what has he done now raven said about the intriguing 
title 
he has a deep masculine voice that pours out incisive songs in 
a style he describes as cajun reggae caribbean cajun electric 
cajun 
no one is doing exactly what were doing he said about his 
style 
someone asked me why i dont do more hard country like randy 
travis and ricky van shelton i said why they do it great and i 
cant do it any better than that 
i want to break some new ground and bring the cajun heritage a 
step farther and a little step up if we can 
raven a native of lafayette la was the oldest of 10 children 
born to a truck driver he began performing and writing in his 
early teens but has worked in the cotton and rice fields as a 
service station attendant and in a lumberyard he even ran 
moonshine for a while 
his first album came out in 1969 making this his 20th year as a 
recording artist 
he said his streak of no 1 records has made him more aggressive 
they make you fight harder to make a better product if you 
are honest and realize how fleeting they are and how fortunate you 
are it makes you work harder to find that better song and change 
that one lyric to make it better 
it also gives you a little more to show for what youve done 
you hang up a no 1 plaque before you hang up a no 3 plaque 
he attributed part of his recent success to being hardheaded 
ive always been stubborn when people made a suggestion i 
always asked why instead of saying ok but i got a little more 
adamant about it i really analyzed everything a little better 
i had more expertise i worked a little bit more im able to 
draw on a lot more road experience and more of what the public is 
listening to

gregg biggins never gave up on oats 
even when prices were low and other farmers thought about 
switching biggins stuck with oats oats is a great crop 
it doesnt need the chemicals or the work that a row crop 
does its nice to be able to have a straw crop to rotate all this 
about oats being good for cholesterol is going to do a lot of good 
for the oats industry 
all this is the fact that oat bran the husk of the kernel 
can help reduce cholesterol and prevent heart attacks so far 
though its been cereal makers and consumers who have reaped the 
benefits farmers are suffering 
the nation raised more oats under abraham lincoln than under 
ronald reagan said keith carlson of the american oat association 
its kind of ironic that production has been declining while the 
demand is increasing 
us oat production plummeted by 42 percent last year to 219 
million bushels the smallest crop on record in south dakota the 
leading oat state in 1987 production dropped 62 percent last year 
to 20 million bushels 
the summers drought was one factor but farmers say government 
programs that favored other crops also were to blame 
its a real shame there just has not been any money in oats 
you have to get paid for something to want to grow it said 
biggins of gregory 
the prices got so bad i just felt like i had been betrayed 
said milt lakness of hayti im a fan of the oat i was tickled 
to think i was raising something that was going into americans 
breakfasts 
some farmers are skeptical about the oat revival said dale 
reeves an oat researcher at south dakota state university 
theres a lot of hesitation to get back into oats youd think 
theyd be clamoring to get back in now 
lakness said hes heard about the oatbran craze and is eating 
more oatmeal himself these days to lower his cholesterol level but 
hes not ready to stake his financial future on the hope of a 
resurgence 
ill plant oats this year but im not going to plant very 
much he said they talk about all this interest in oats but 
if you could make more money on other crops would you plant oats 
the arithmetic is just not there 
lawmakers havent tried to encourage production because until 
recently no one really cared about oats carlson said since the 
public wasnt eating them it didnt make that much difference 
that may be changing a provision of last years drought bill 
gave farmers more freedom to plant oats we were trying to level 
out the playing field for oats said anne simmons an aide to 
us rep tim johnson dsd 
another measure introduced by johnson and sen tom daschle 
dsd would give farmers more flexibility and would raise the 
governmentguaranteed price eliminating what daschle called 
distortions in agriculture programs that discourage oats 
production 
deon stuthman an oat researcher at the university of minnesota 
and chairman of the national oat improvement council thinks 
congress may go even further people in a lot of different areas 
are embarrassed that the united states will be importing 70 million 
bushels of oats this year he said 
imports are another reason farmers shouldnt count on a boom 
lakness said we farmers in this part of the state raise the 
finest oats of anyplace in the nation then the oat people decide 
they can get a better deal somewhere else

botanists thought they had plant sex figured 
out 
after all all 248000 known flowering plants had the pistil 
the female parts in the center and the stamen the male parts 
outside 
but biologist esteban martinez tromping through three feet of 
decaying tropical muck in a chiggerridden jungle has proved once 
again that little can be taken for granted in science 
lacandonia schismatica a flower the size of a sesame seed has 
the stamen in the center surrounded by about 50 pistils 
it defies all logic said warren stevens head of research 
at the missouri botanical garden in st louis he said a paper on 
the discovery will appear in an upcoming issue of annals of the 
missouri botanical garden 
martinez who works at the national university of mexico found 
the starshaped flower on a fallen tree trunk in the lacandon 
jungle at first he thought hed picked up a type of mushroom and 
it took a year to discover and prove it was an exception to the 
sexual rule 
it seems to be some sort of massive mutation one of the 
sacred things has been that the female parts are inside the male 
stevens said 
more study is needed to see what advantage a reverse arrangement 
could have the plant appears to reproduce as other flowering 
plants do pollen from the stamen fertilizes the ovaries which are 
part of the pistils the ovaries turn into fruit which produce 
seeds 
martinez and clara hilda ramos agreed to discuss the discovery 
before publication because they believe the plants habitat is 
threatened by logging 
cutting was banned last year in the 20acre site where the plant 
has been found but martinez said hed heard that members of the 
chol indian tribe are seeking permission to cut chicle trees 
valued because their wood resists rot 
the reserve is in chiapas state near the guatemalan border 
weve advised all the authorities in chiapas and the federal 
ecology department and we hope they take the proper measures 
martinez said 
each plant has four to seven flowers 2 millimeters in diameter 
growing along threadlike stems up to 3 inches long the flowers 
have six tepals a kind of petal ending in turnedup points 
they are thickish something like the fleshy leaves of a jade 
plant in the center is a mound of ovaries encircling an average of 
three stamen 
the plant is a brilliant almost translucent white like 
crystal ramos said as the ovaries mature the center turns 
yellow then to the reddishbrown color of its fruit so tiny 
theyre like a fine dust 
lacking chlorophyll the plant gets its energy from decomposing 
material in the dark humid jungle with the help of a fungus that 
lives in its roots 
martinez and ramos believe the plant doesnt belong to any 
existing family and propose that it be categorized as family 
lacandoniaceae genus lacandonia and species schismatica for the 
jungle and the fact that it broke with traditional botanical faith 
stevens said the plant is clearly a new genus and species but 
he expects it to fall into the existing family of triuridaceae 
which includes varieties of flowering plants with normally arranged 
sexual parts 
when he spotted the plant in september 1985 martinez was 
collecting for flora mesoamericana a survey run by the national 
university the missouri botanical garden and the natural history 
museum in london 
he has been unable to find the plant in other parts of the 
jungle but stevens thinks it will appear my experience is that 
plants dont have ranges that restricted he said 
the plant has survived for as long as six weeks in the 
laboratory but it then dies perhaps because it doesnt fertilize 
itself and may need insects to carry its pollen to another plants 
pistils

an apple a day really might keep the doctor 
away especially if the doctor knew what went on it 
if fruit were labele the label on apples 
would list fiber potassium and vitamin c all of which are good 
for you it also might list azinphis methyl captan supracide 
parathion elgetol sevin naa nad ziram diphenylamine lorsban 
and benzimidazole 
these might not be so good but theyre among the dozens of 
chemicals routinely used to bring apples from fruit trees to fruit 
bowls 
without some of them according to pennsylvania apple grower 
john rice chairman of the international apple institute people 
would have to get used to biting into an apple and seeing a whole 
or half a worm 
probably the bestknown of these chemicals right now is alar 
the market name for daminozide which helps apples ripen extends 
shelf life and prevents bruising many schools pulled apples from 
their lunchrooms this month after the natural res 
council said alar increased the risk of cancer among children 
whose diet contains proportionally more fruit than adults 
most schools let apples back in after the claim was disputed by 
regulators uniroyal chemical co and the industry which cut its 
use of alar to 5 percent of the 12 billionayear crop since 
concerns were first raised in 1985 
but dozens of other chemicals are routinely used and the nrdc 
considers several of them to be cancercausing even though like 
alar they are legal 
a recent louis harris poll found that 842 percent of americans 
would choose organically grown food if given the choice but rice 
said that without the chemicals an apple would be a rather 
small gnarled object that kind of resembled an apple it would 
be covered with a black fungus scab infested with various decay 
molds which could have natural carcinogens it would undoubtedly 
have codling bud moths and other types of larvae 
washingtons 5000 growers who produce about half the nations 
apples spend an average 449 per acre to buy and apply chemicals 
each year said brooke peterson a washington state university tree 
fruit extension agent 
many of the chemicals have been identified as harmful to childen 
by the nrdc report which studied chemical residues on food but 
those findings are in dispute and the food and drug 
administration environmental protection agency department of 
agriculture and surgeon general have all said apples are safe 
here is a typical chemical season for washington apples 
in early april before bloom an organophosphate spray 
supracide lorsban or parathion kills the eggs of european red 
mites and also controls the spread of san jose scale a pest which 
can kill trees 
in may growers will apply guthion the marketing name for 
azinphis methyl an insecticide that kills the codling moth larva 
which produces worms in apples and is the most damaging pest in the 
orchard 
also applied at bloom time is elgetol a thinner that burns 
off some of the flowers reducing the number of apples a tree will 
bear untreated trees will produce huge crops one year and tiny 
ones the next to conserve energy another thinner is sevin an 
insecticide made from the chemical carbarylaced alar as a stopdrop 
which 
farmers would spray about a month after bloom to keep apples on 
trees an apple on the ground is worthless naa and nad are less 
effective and there is no substitute for alars ability to extend 
shelf life peterson said 
ziram or captan fungicides used to battle bulls eye rot also 
are applied at this time 
in warehouses the apples are rinsed washed with detergent 
rinsed again sometimes waxed dried and placed in boxes for 
shipment 
those destined for storage for three months to a year might be 
treated with two chemicals one is benzimidazole a fungicide the 
other is diphenylamine which prevents the red skin from turning 
brown

find yourself forgetting names and appointments 
mislaying keys and groping for words with increasing frequency as 
you grow older 
two daily tablespoons of lecithin a common healthfood staple 
could help 
the medical community accepts that there may be a role for 
lecithin in aiding memory said neurologist barry baumel of the 
neuromedical centers of south florida baumel and florence safford 
a florida international university social work professor studied 
the effects of lecithin last year 
in their study 41 subjects aged 50 to 80 were given two 
tablespoons a day of lecithin for four weeks and 20 others received 
placebos they kept logs of memoryloss incidents the seven days 
before and after taking the substance 
ninety percent of the lecithin group had a significant decrease 
in memory lapses safford said the placebo group had 60 percent 
more such lapses though that may have resulted from increased 
awareness because of keeping track 
in addition 40 percent of lecithin takers reported an 
improvement in mood a decrease in anxiety and a general sense of 
well being she said none of the placebo takers reported any 
change in mood 
the study was limited to people with mild memory loss not those 
with the severe symptoms or alzheimers disease for whom lecithin 
already has failed to show significant results ms safford said 
lecithin contains lots of b vitamins particularly one called 
choline known to improve the work of neurotransmitters brain 
cells that fire electric charges that make our thought processes 
work by adding choline to the diet you are helping this brain 
mechanism to fire faster ms safford said 
there may not be dramatic changes were not looking at people 
suddenly becoming geniuses but even if it helps a little bit we 
should try it 
but choline needs to pass the bloodbrain barrier which keeps 
harmful chemicals from damaging the brain lecithin which is 
similar to chemicals in the brain turns out to be an ideal 
transporter it has an emulsifier that allows it to pass through 
the bloodbrain barrier safford said 
the lecithin is taken in granule form mixed with a liquid like 
fruit juice or sprinkled on cereal rather than in capsules she 
said youd have to take 16 to 20 capsules a day to equal the 
same amount as a tablespoon 
the only reported ill effect from lecithin was mild diarrhea

nothing helps scenery like ham and eggs mark 
twain once remarked but healthconscious americans are choosing a 
bowl of oat bran instead to brighten up their breakfast horizons 
consumer craving for the husk of the oat kernel has opened up a 
whole new landscape for cereal makers and bakers while critics 
charge that greedy food companies are unscrupulously capitalizing 
on the consumer craze 
almost 1 years have passed since the oatbran boom began 
ignited by scientific studies indicating that just over an ounce of 
oat bran eaten daily as part of a lowfat diet could help prevent 
heart attacks 
quaker oats co the nations largest oat miller and maker of 
oat bran cereal is turning out a million pounds of oat bran a 
month compared with a million a year two years ago and is 
introducing a cold oat bran cereal 
meanwhile competitors are jumping on the bran wagon including 
nabisco foods co of parsippany nj and st louisbased ralston 
purina co oat bran is going into everything from pancakes to 
potato chips 
the magic of oat bran is that it is one of the best known 
sources of soluble fiber which reduces cholesterol in the blood 
and along with it risk of heart disease beans like pinto kidney 
and navy psyllium a seed grain rice bran and fruits with 
pectin like apples and grapefruit are good sources 
one of the most important studies of oat bran found that people 
with normal blood cholesterol levels who went on a lowfat diet 
reduced their cholesterol levels by about 5 percent but if their 
diets included 2 ounces of oat bran or oat meal the cholesterol 
levels dropped 8 percent to 9 percent 
every 1 percent decline in blood cholesterol is believed to 
result in a 1 percent to 2 percent reduction in heart attack risk 
said dietitian linda van horn who led the study at northwestern 
university medical school 
as little as 34 grams of oat bran a little more than an ounce 
have been found to produce the cholesterollowering effect in 
scientific studies 
but that knowledge may be of little help to consumers facing 
torrents of advertising hype and a jungle of new oatbran products 
it can take more than a dozen servings a day of some foods to see 
benefits and some products are full of highly saturated fats that 
may drive up bloodcholesterol levels more than the oat bran lowers 
them check the label nutritionists warn

study is needed to see what advantage the reversal could have the 
plant appears to reproduce as others do pollen from the stamen 
fertilizes the ovaries which turn into fruit 
it defies all logic said warren stevens head of research 
at the missouri botanical garden in st louis a paper on the 
discovery will appear in an upcoming issue of annals of the 
missouri botanical garden 
the plant is a brilliant almost translucent white like 
crystal said martinez colleague clara hilda ramos as the 
ovaries mature the center turns yellow then the reddishbrown of 
its fruit so tiny theyre like a fine dust 
lacking chlorophyll the plant gets its energy from decomposing 
material in the dark humid jungle with the help of a fungus that

if fruit were labeled with ingredients the 
label on apples would list fiber potassium and vitamin c which 
are good for you 
it also might list azinphis methyl captan supracide 
parathion elgetol sevin naa nad ziram diphenylamine lorsban 
and benzimidazole these might not be so good but theyre among 
dozens of chemicals routinely used to bring apples from fruit trees 
to fruit bowls 
many have been identified by the natural resources defense 
council as harmful to childen based on chemical residues on food 
but those findings are in dispute and federal regulators and the 
industry say apples are safe 
here is a typical chemical season for washington apples 
in early april an organophosphate spray supracide lorsban or 
parathion kills the eggs of european red mites and also controls 
the spread of san jose scale a pest which can kill trees 
in may guthion the marketing name for azinphis methyl kills 
codling the moth larva the most damaging pest in the orchard 
also applied at bloom time is elgetol a thinner that burns 
off some flowers reducing the number of apples a tree will bear 
untreated trees will produce huge crops one year and tiny ones the 
next to conserve energy another thinner is sevin an insecticide 
made from the chemical carbaryl 
naa and nad have largely replaced alar to keep apples on trees 
longer they are less effective and there is no substitute for 
alars ability to extend shelf life 
ziram or captan fungicides used to battle bulls eye rot also 
are applied at this time

fat people shouldnt climb stairs for 
exercise because it can put dangerous stress on their hearts a 
physician says 
stair climbing is excellent exercise for individuals who are 
not overweight however stair climbing is not the best way for 
overweight people to lose weight said dr marque hunter a 
university of texas medical branch pulmonary specialist who tested 
20 men at or near their ideal weight and 10 who were 30 percent 
overweight on a miniature escalator sold for exercise 
an overweight person must perform an excessive amount of work 
to climb stairs even at a modest pace hunter recently told the 
federation of american societies for experimental biology 
the men were tested at 40 50 60 and 70 steps a minute for five 
minutes at each speed going without a rest from one speed to the 
next heart rates and oxygen consumption were measured throughout 
fifty steps a minute is about normal climbing speed but only 
three of the fat men managed to get past 40 steps a minute hunter 
said seven of the 10 reached exhaustion in three or four minutes 
at the lowest speed the other three reached exhaustion in the next 
five minutes 
nearly all of the other group got to 60 or 70 steps a minund of a nut 
and a bolt you sew on 
the nut part into the front of the eye then screw the bolt in 
through this supporting structure said barron 
one major problem is that rejection sets in faster than many 
other sorts of plastic implants he said its different than an 
artificial heart valve or an artificial hip where its totally 
enclosed for the patient to see it has to protrude partly out 
and the body tries to extrude it 
patients must use an antibiotic ointment on the lens and eyelid 
at night with a pad to protect the lens and close the eye for 
sleep in the morning they clean it off with hydrogen peroxide on 
a cotton swab some implants can last for years but complications 
usually set in after a year or two

a gynecologist says hes developed a test to 
detect whether moodiness is a result of premenstrual syndrome but 
others say his work is promising although the sample is too small 
to be conclusive 
dr edward m portman whose clinic in madison wis 
specializes in pms and menopausal care told the federation of 
american societies for experimental biology that he has found low 
levels of the antibody for leuteinizing hormone the hormone 
controlling ovulation among pms sufferers 
portman said his is the first biological test for pms which is 
estimated to affect anywhere from onetenth to half of all women 
it would be wonderful if we had a test like that said dr 
patricia k branning a new orleans gynecologist a test would help 
doctors convince women whose depression was not due to pms that 
they needed to try other treatment 
she and gynecologist mary francis gardner said portmans sample 
456 women with pms and 65 symptomfree controls was too small 
for conclusive results 
pms is such a very diffuse problem its hard to deal with it 
has such protean manifestations said branning i think you 
aways wonder if its not more than one thing that weve lumped 
together under one heading 
symptoms include depression distorted thinking angry 
outbursts headache food binges and bloating in the weeks between 
ovulation and menstruation 
without a test portman said doctors must see whether a womans 
symptoms fit pms and ask her to chart them against her period for 
several months 
we are at the very embryonic stage of what we have said 
portman we have a high and statistic significant correlation of 
antibody levels and pms hopefully over the next few years we can 
unravel more of this

the number of working oil and gas rigs jumped 
this week by 26 to total 766 baker hughes inc reported 
last week the rig count fell by three to total 740 a year ago 
the total was 935 the company said monday 
the rig count is a widely watched industry index of drilling 
activity and it reflects the number of rigs actively exploring for 
oil as of last friday not the number of rigs actively producing 
oil 
houstonbased hughes tool co an oil toolmaker that merged with 
baker international corp of orange calif has kept track of the 
rig count since 1940 
in december 1981 at the height of the oil boom the rig count 
reached a peak of 4500 but oil prices plunged to less than 10 
per 42gallon barrel in the summer of 1986 prompting a collapse in 
the rig count that bottomed out at 663 the lowest since hughes 
began compiling figures 
among major oil producing states oklahoma had the biggest 
increase with nine additional rigs followed by kansas and 
louisiana four each california and north dakota three each and 
colorado and michigan one each

a federal judge today set a hearing on a key issue 
in eastern airlines efforts to force its pilots back to work 
while the strikebound carrier began its first class in training 
replacement pilots 
us district judge edward davis said this morning he would hear 
arguments thursday on whether the pilots strike was only a refusal 
to cross machinists picket lines or was a primary strike which 
could be illegal under the railway labor act 
the 11th circuit court of appeals in atlanta had asked the judge 
for a decision on the issue which is central to easterns legal 
efforts to end the 3weekold walkout 
as i see it i need to make a determination whether refusal to 
cross the picket line is a pretext the judge said today i 
must determine what the appeals court means about pretext 
air line pilots association attorney james linsey asked for 
thursdays hearing during the judges meeting with lawyers 
we dont think that eastern has shown in the previous hearings 
that alpas action was a pretext linsey said 
alpa claims the railway labor act gives its members the right to 
show sympathy for the striking machinists the appeals court 
agreed but added that a claim of a sympathy strike cannot be 
used as a pretext to shield conduct that otherwise would be a clear 
violation of the railway labor act 
eastern lawyer david ross said today that the judge already had 
enough evidence unsuccessfully arguing for davis to immediately 
forward to the appeals judges the finding that the pilots walkout 
was not allowed 
meanwhile eastern spokesman jim ashlock said the first sixweek 
training class for about 40 replacement pilots was beginning today 
with an organizational session all but 200 of easterns 3600 
pilots have refused to work since the strike began march 4 
i have heard that theyre even coming from other airlines 
ashlock said of the new pilots theyre coming over because they 
can make seniority faster 
eastern has been operating only about 10 percent of its daily 
prestrike schedule of 1040 flights concentrating on routes from 
the airlines miami hub to the northeast and from florida to the 
caribbean which were the most heavily traveled on easterns past 
said spokeswoman karen ceremsak 
the pilots union continued to play down easterns efforts to 
hire replacement pilots saying there simply arent enough pilots 
to fill available airline slots especially at eastern and 
continental airlines which are operated by frank lorenzos 
houstonbased texas air corp 
young pilots know better than to go to work for frank 
lorenzo said capt jack saux a delta airlines pilot and 
chairman of alpas education committee saux said in a news release 
that he and other alpa members have been meeting with pilots from 
regional airlines and corporations as well as student pilots

crude oil futures opened sharply higher today in 
a rally oil traders and analysts predicted would result from last 
weeks closing of an alaskan harbor to contain a massive oil spill 
the valdez alaska harbor was closed friday after 240000 
barrels of oil spilled from an exxon shipping co oil tanker that 
ran aground on a reef south of the port city it is being called 
the largest oil spill in us history 
valdez is the only terminal that handles crude oil produced on 
the north slope of alaska the source of more than 25 percent of 
us production 
the volume of alaskan crude that has been temporarily disrupted 
is more than 3 times the amount of north sea production shut down 
during recent months because of a series of accidents 
the may contract for west texas intermediate the benchmark 
grade of us crude oil was up 57 cents from thursdays close at 
2072 per 42gallon barrel on the new york mercantile exchange 
us commodity markets were closed friday for the good friday 
holiday 
refined products traded on the exchange also rose sharply april 
unleaded gasoline was 5995 cents per gallon up 193 cents from 
thursdays close and heating oil was 5770 cents a gallon up 118 
cents from thursday 
most alaskan crude goes to west coast refineries which will be 
scambling for supplies said sam f willson jr senior vice 
president of the coastal corp he expects prices to move higher 
immediately and to climb sharply if the harbor remains closed past 
the middle of the week 
if it is down all next week it is going to drive prices up 
quite a bit there is nothing else available to take the place of 
alaskan north slope crude for those west coast refineries 
willson said 
the us coast guard has not indicated how long the valdez 
harbor will be closed but no ships will be allowed to leave until 
all remaining oil has been pumped out of the exxon tanker said 
john ratterman spokesman for alyeska pipeline service co the 
operator of the transalaska pipeline and the valdez terminal 
the 987foot tanker exxon valdez carrying 12 million barrels 
of north slope crude ran onto a reef 25 miles from port early 
friday after swinging out of a traffic lane to avoid ice valdez is 
at the southern end of the 800mile alaska oil pipeline

mcorp one of texas largest banking companies 
today announced it would seek protection from creditors under 
chapter 11 of the us bankruptcy code in response to involuntary 
bankruptcy petitions filed against it 
the troubled bank holding company which last fall stopped 
making interest and principal payments on about 470 million of 
debt while it attempted to recapitalize said three noteholders 
last week filed a bankruptcy court petition in new york seeking to 
have mcorp involuntarily sold off to pay creditor claims 
mcorp spokesman george a mccane said the company learned friday 
about the filings for the involuntary chapter 7 bankruptcy 
liquidation 
mcorp deeply regrets that those noteholders ignored our pleas 
not to take premature and unnecessary action gene h bishop 
mcorps chairman and chief executive officer said in a prepared 
statement 
bishop said he hoped the action by a very small number of 
noteholders seeking to force liquidation of mcorp would not disrupt 
or interfere with discussions between prospective investors and the 
federal deposit insurance corp on terms of a recapitalization plan 
under chapter 11 of the federal bankruptcy law mcorp would be 
protected from creditor claims while it reorganizes under 
bankruptcy court supervision and works out a plan to pay debts 
mcorps chapter 11 filing would supercede the chapter 7 
petition which calls for the total sale of the company to satisfy 
creditors 
mcorp spokesman mccane said the company has not yet indicated 
when it would ask the bankruptcy court to convert the involuntary 
liquidation request to a chapter 11 reorganization case mcorp has 
20 days to convert the petitions once the company is served with 
them 
the companys individual mbanks arent involved and the filings 
should not affect the companys business bishop said 
we want all of the depositors customers employees and 
suppliers of mbanks to know that our 86 offices will remain open 
for business as usual bishop said 
since last fall bishop said mcorp representatives have met 
several times with noteholders and urged them not to take action 
prematurely despite the moratorium on payment of principal and 
interst on borrowed money while the company proceeded with efforts 
to recapitalize 
the wall street journal identified the three creditors who filed 
the chapter 7 petitions as sn phelps amp co a greenwich conn 
bond broker that claims to hold 2 million principal amount in 
mcorp debentures and janice m eberhardt and carol r james each 
of whom claims to hold 5000 in debentures 
i walton bader an attorney for the holders told the journal 
his clients decided to file for chapter 7 liquidation for fear that 
mcorp would be forced to pump its holding company assets into the 
failing mbanks thereby putting the money out of reach of creditors 
the journal quoted analysts as saying mcorps move complicates 
the fdics efforts to arrange a sale of mcorp the fdic had set an 
april 3 deadline for bids to acquire mcorp 
the fdic has the authority to sell or otherwise dispose of 
insolvent banks once they have been closed by the us comptroller 
of the currency but a bankruptcy filing would make any plan to 
sell the company subject to a bankruptcy judges approval 
fdic records show that 25 banks owned by mcorp posted a 213 
million fourthquarter loss and lost 903 million in 1988

american medical international inc 
is pondering a 168 billion offer to take the company private as 
well as a restructuring plan by senior management that would keep 
it publicly traded 
no determination has been made to sell the company or engage 
in any other transaction the hospital company said in a 
statement adding that it appointed a committee of six outside 
directors to evaluate the proposals 
both proposals were revealed sunday 
the 168 billion debtfinanced takeover plan proposed by 
minority shareholder dr m lee pearce of miami and and an 
investment group offers 24 a share for american medical stock 
including 20 to 22 in cash and the remainder in securities under 
this offer the buyers also would assume some 14 billion in 
longterm debt 
pearce who already owns nearly 10 percent of the companys 70 
million shares is making the offer with shamrock investments a 
private los angeles investment firm it is unrelated to shamrock 
holdings inc the investment firm controlled by roy e disney 
american medical also said it is pondering a restructuring 
proposal which it didnt describe in detail that proposal 
developed by an unidentified investment banking firm and senior 
managers would keep the company in public hands and could 
provide over a six to ninemonth period total shareholder value of 
between 25 and 29 per share including a special cash divided 
the company said 
the company said its recently named chairman and chief 
executive richard a gilleland is officially neutral on the two 
proposals which were presented to american medicals board on 
thursday

disappointing earnings and the depressed value of its shares which

weisman as chief executive 
a statement from shamrock said the investors think we can do 
far better if not subjected to the quarterly pressures of 
investors

181 million or 26 cents per share for the three months ending 
feb 28 on revenues of 6782 million during the same period a 
year earlier earnings were 241 million or 30 cents per share 
on revenues of 7661 million

opec ministers gather this week to 
review a recentlystrengthened world oil market and the impact of 
the cartels strategy for cutting production to help boost crude 
prices 
eight ministers of the organization of petroleum exporting 
countries were scheduled to begin talks wednesday at cartel 
headquarters in vienna 
subroto secretarygeneral of the 13nation organization told 
reporters last week that the ministers members of a monitoring 
committee would review the market and make certain the new accord 
was working well 
the cartel agreed last november on a new quota system limiting 
each members output in the first half of this year in an attempt 
to support a price of 18 a barrel the overall production level 
was set at 185 million barrels a day well under the actual output 
at years end 
many analysts had been skeptical the opec countries would comply 
with their quotas but now say most nations generally have met 
their targets 
theyve done better adhering to their quotas than most had 
expected said fergus macleod oil analyst at barclays de zoete 
wedd in london 
prices have looked amazingly good he said 
the average price of a basket of crudes monitored by opec 
reaching 1750 a barrel last week up more than 5 from late 
november when the output deal was struck 
in us futures trading the may contract for west texas 
intermediate the benchmark us crude was up 45 cents at 2060 a 
barrel monday on the new york mercantile exchange 
although mondays price was inflated by speculation stemming 
from the closing of the alaskan pipeline at valdez due to a major 
offshore oil spill it still reflected the crudes sharp surge from 
the twoyear low of 1260 reached last oct 5 
subroto said my feeling is that there seems to be a bullish 
expectation in the market to see a strong price level so we will 
enter the second quarter which is usually a weak quarter with a 
stronger demand than had been foreseen 
independent producing nations also were expected to curb exports 
by a total of less than 300000 barrels daily in the apriljune 
quarter to support opecs efforts 
the soviet union the worlds largest crude producer said it 
would join the cuts in the second quarter when prices generally 
decline with the onset of warmer weather in oilimporting countries 
with the good wintertime results the ministers also likely will 
hold initial discussions on production levels for the second half 
of this year those quotas wont be set until a full meeting of all 
opec ministers june 5 in vienna 
sheik ali khalifa alsabah kuwaits oil minister told the 
middle east economic survey that opec should boost its production 
ceiling by 15 million barrels a day to 20 million barrels in the 
last six months of the year 
he said in an interview published monday that the cartels price 
target should be maintained at 18 a barrel 
since the production accord opec has reported that 12 of the 
nations complied with the agreement in january and february by 
curtailing output for the international market 
the cartel said the 12 nations pumped 174 million barrels of 
oil a day in february compared with the daily ceiling of 1751 
million barrels set for those dozen countries 
the statement said the united arab emirates had not reported 
supply figures in january or february that country persistently 
has exceeded its daily quota of 988000 barrels analysts estimate 
its current production at more than 15 million barrels a day 
ministers who form the monitoring committee represent algeria 
indonesia iran iraq kuwait nigeria saudi arabia and venezuela 
other opec members are ecuador gabon libya qatar and the united 
arab emirates

scientists are experimenting with new uses of 
chemical agents to aid in the cleanup of oil spills but mechanical 
methods such as vacuum pumps skimmer boats and absorbant pads 
are still the most widely used 
at the spill in alaskas prince william sound the volume of 
crude oil in the water is so large 101 million gallons that 
mechanical means are being supplemented with the use of approved 
chemicals to disperse some of the oil on the surface 
exxon shipping co owner of the tanker that spilled the oil 
friday near the port of valdez also planned to burn fingers of 
the oil slick by igniting them with a laser 
experiments also are being conducted with the use of a chemical 
agent that rather than dispersing the oil on the waters surface 
causes it to draw together to make it easier to remove with vacuum 
pumps said harry schultz a cleanup expert with the coast guard in 
washington 
under the best circumstances some oil remains in the water 
after a spill cleanup operation wind and wave action emulsify some 
of it some is consumed by bacteria 
in an ocean spill oil on the waters surface can be herded into 
one area by skimmer boats that use winglike devices to guide it 
vacuum machines then pump it onto floating barges which take it 
ashore in tanks and transfer it to trucks 
for oil that has washed ashore or entered shallowwater areas in 
which skimmer boats cannot be used cleanup crews can use a string 
of absorbant pads that soak up the crude 
a variety of chemicals usually in liquid form also can be used 
to break up sections of the oil slick some chemical agents are 
used to make the oil sink to the bottom where it poses no direct 
threat to birds 
burning agents also are used although questions have been 
raised about whether the advantages brought by these and other 
chemical agents outweigh the disadvantages of adding more 
pollutants to the water or air

grain and soybean futures closed sharply lower 
monday on the chicago board of trade amid forecasts for wet weather 
in the nations major cropgrowing areas 
further selling was attributed to technical factors and to 
increasingly bearish expectations for fridays plantedacreage 
estimate and quarterly grain stocks report from the agriculture 
department 
the soybean market appeared to lead the decline with much of 
the selling in that market stemming from fridays 6to10day 
forecast from the national weather service predicting aboveaverage 
rainfall march 30april 3 in most of the central and all of the 
eastern united states 
oats for may and july delivery fell the permitted daily limit of 
10 cents a bushel on rain forecasts 
there seems to be just a perception that the weather is 
getting better and it comes in a very timely fashion for oats 
which are just getting ready to be seeded said dale gustafson a 
market analyst with drexel burnham lambert inc 
at the close wheat was cent to 4 cents lower with the 
contract for delivery in may at 427 a bushel corn was 6 cents 
to 7 cents lower with may at 271 a bushel oats were 9 cents to

shamrock holdings inc abandoned its 
eightmonthold struggle to acquire polaroid corp monday less 
than a week after a delaware court dealt the company a fatal blow 
in its attempt to gain control of the instant photography giant 
polaroid officials said they entered into an agreement with 
shamrock under which shamrock would terminate its 32 billion 
tender offer and proxy contest and both sides would end litigation 
resulting from the shamrock bid 
shamrock based in burbank calif and its affiliate companies 
also agreed not to attempt to gain control of polaroid for at least 
10 years 
shamrock which offered 45 a share for polaroid stock was 
stymied thursday by a delaware court decision clearing the way for 
polaroid to repurchase 16 million shares at a premium price of 50 
each 
we are disappointed and frustrated by the delaware courts 
shamrock president stanley gold said monday its certainly not 
good news for folks who are trying to do what we did 
some analysts said the delaware ruling allowing the polaroid 
purchase could signal a new era in the kinds of defensive 
strategies planned by takeover targets 
up until now attacking companies have been able to peel away 
layer by layer of companies defenses said brian fernandez 
managing director of brean murray foster securities inc in new 
york this is one of the first ways anyones found to be 
successful 
as part of its defense polaroid placed an estimated onethird 
of its shares in friendly hands through the stock buyback an 
employee stock ownership plan and the sale of preferred shares to 
corporate partners lp an investor group formed to help companies 
fight hostile takeover bids 
the moves were designed to frustrate shamrocks attempt to 
unseat the polaroid board at the companys annual meeting and its 
tender offer 
under the settlement polaroid will distribute to shareholders 
part of the aftertax proceeds from a copyright infringement suit 
against eastman kodak a trial to determine damages from kodak is 
scheduled to begin in boston next month 
polaroid also bought 5 million worth of advertising on 
shamrocks radio and television stations and reimbursed shamrock 
for 20 million in expenses connected with the litigation and 
tender offer 
shamrock accumulated 495 million shares of polaroid during the 
takeover battle and tendered all of those shares before the 
midnight deadline last thursday 
according to filings with the securities and exchange 
commission shamrock paid an average price of about 31 a share for 
its stake in polaroid by selling 27 percent of its shares back to 
polaroid for 50 each shamrock can expect to receive approximately 
67 million 
shamrocks remaining 36 million shares of polaroid would 
conservatively be worth more than 130 million yielding a profit 
of approximately 42 million before legal fees financing costs and 
other takeover expenses 
polaroid said the final number of shares tendered under the 
buyback offer and the definitive prorating formula will be 
determined april 4 payments will go out to stockholders as soon as 
possible after that date the company said

former defense secretary frank carlucci and wall 
street attorney leon silverman are among those being considered for 
the influential role of examiner in the eastern airlines bankruptcy 
reorganization sources close to the situation said monday

broad mandate for overseeing a bankruptcy case will be charged 
with reviewing eastern business transactions and mediating disputes 
among the parties involved in the case including strikebound 
eastern its unions and its creditors 
us bankruptcy court judge burton lifland who is overseeing 
easterns chapter 11 reorganization on thursday ordered the 
appointment of an examiner with expanded powers saying it was in 
the publics interest to do so 
eastern sought bankruptcy court protection from creditors on 
march 9 becuase of a cash drain stemming from a strike by its 
machinists pilots and flight attendants that has virtually 
paralyzed the miamibased airline 
us trustee harold jones who is administering the eastern 
bankruptcy case said he was considering about a dozen candidates 
for examiner in the complex proceeding he said he hoped to decide 
by late this week or early next week on an examiner to recommend to 
lifland 
in addition to mediating disputes among parties in the case the 
examiner will review financial transactions between eastern its 
parent texas air corp and sister carrier continental airlines 
easterns unions claim that texas air has been attempting to funnel 
eastern assets to continental a nonunion carrier 
the ideal examiner would be someone who can play the role of 
statesman jones said in a telephone interview monday 
jones declined to name people on the list but the sources who 
asked not to be identified said the candidates include carlucci 
and silverman who represented some claimants in manville corps 
chapter 11 proceeding that began in august 1982 and ended this past 
january 
silverman a securities lawyer is one of the lead defense 
attorneys for imprisoned inside trader ivan f boesky 
carlucci also a former chairman of the national security 
council now is vice chairman and managing director of carlyle 
group an investment banking firm based in washington dc 
carluccis secretary said he was unavailable to comment and 
silverman himself declined comment monday 
silverman was a very effective and important part of the 
resolution of our bankruptcy said a manville spokesman who 
wished not to be identified further speaking from the companys 
headquarters in denver 
jones said the candidates under consideration were recommended 
to him either by eastern management the airlines unions or the 
committee of 15 eastern creditors he appointed last week some of 
the candidates put themselves forward for the position he said 
its a mediator with clout said william ury associate 
director of the program on negotiation at harvard law school 
bruce simon an attorney for the air line pilots association 
said the unions are looking for a strong public figure beholden 
to no specific interest including our own 
the examiner will need to bang the parties heads together to 
see if a solution can be achieved here simon said 
harvey miller easterns lead bankruptcy attorney said the 
company would like an examiner who has somewhat of a national 
reputation is impartial and has a strong legal or financial 
background

bank of america is negotiating with japans 
largest bank card company for the exclusive right to honor the jcb 
credit card at more than 100000 outlets in the united states bank 
officials announced monday 
this historic agreement would allow japanese tourists and 
business travelers visiting the united states to use their most 
popular credit card throughout our extensive merchant base said 
joe fontana senior vice president in charge of merchant services 
at the san franciscobased bank 
bank of america says it can perform all sales and servicing of 
jcb international co ltd card accounts through its existing 
credit card programs and will bill merchants for jcb use through 
bank of america statements 
under the deal no other bank can honor the jcb card in the 
united states 
jcbs six sponsoring japanese banks which are not prohibited 
from setting up their own servicing programs with us merchants 
currently have no such programs through independent arrangements 
jcb is accepted at about 20000 us businesses most of them on 
the west coast and in hawaii 
this deal will greatly expand the utility of our card for our 
holder dramatically both for visitors and japanese nationals now 
living or working in the united states said jcb dwane krumme in 
los angeles 
fontana indicated bofas move is the first step toward expanding 
merchants ability to accept various bank cards without having to 
arrange service programs with each sponsoring company 
we feel this will be a significant step in providing merchants 
with a convenient consolidated service for different card types 
said fontana 
jcb is japans largest bankrelated credit card issuer and has a 
card base of more than 13 million and a merchant network of more 
than 1 million establishments worldwide the jcb card currently is 
accepted in 102 countries and territories although most of the 
companys business remains limited to asia 
fontana said the agreement is expected to be signed within 90 
days and would apply to 60000 businesses with 100000 outlets 
nationwide if approved bofa will be the first major overseas 
partner of jcb

chicago board of trade amid forecasts for april showers in the 
nations major cropgrowing areas 
on other markets orange juice futures surged for the second 
straight session energy futures advanced sharply precious metals 
were lower and livestock and meat futures were mixed 
wheat futures settled 1 cent to 4 cents lower with the contract 
for delivery in may at 427 a bushel corn was 6 cents to 7 
cents lower with may at 271 a bushel oats were 9 cents to 10 
cents lower with may at 195 a bushel soybeans were 12 cents to 
16 cents lower with may at 768 a bushel 
the selloff in the grain and soybean markets was widely seen as 
a reaction to fridays 6to10day national weather service 
forecast for aboveaverage rainfall march 30april 3 in most of the 
central and all of the eastern united states 
the winter wheat crop in the central and southern great plains 
is in need of precipitation and rain also is needed to replenish 
soil moisture in the midwest where corn soybean and oat planting 
will soon begin 
further selling was attributed to internal market influences and 
to increasingly bearish expectations for fridays plantedacreage 
estimate and quarterly grain stocks report from the agriculture 
department 
the combination of the threat of precipitation and that very 
important government report just triggered a lot of liquidation 
said pat oconnell a grainmarket analyst with refco inc a large 
chicagobased futures brokerage 
a new 6to10day national weather service forecast issued after 
the close called for mostly dry weather in the great plains and 
parts of the midwest april 26

registered the steepest relative losses oats for may and july

frozen concentrated orange juice futures soared the 
5centsapound limit on the new york cotton exchange on buying 
linked to reports that some of floridas largest orangejuice 
processors had raised or planned to raise their wholesale prices to 
160165 a pound from 150 
the price increase may cause a scramble for nearterm deliveries 
but projections for abundant supplies from brazil should ensure 
against supply tightness said analyst judy ganes of shearson 
lehman hutton inc 
orange juice settled 470 to 5 cents higher with may at 1609 a 
pound 
oil futures rose sharply on the new york mercantile exchange 
amid supplyshortage fears linked to the massive oil spill in 
alaska the spill forced a shutdown of alaskas port of valdez 
cutting the pipeline output of alaskan crude oil by more than half 
west texas intermediate crude oil settled 13 cent to 42 cent 
higher with may at 2053 a barrel heating oil was 86 cent to

troy ounce 
cattle futures finished mostly higher on the chicago mercantile 
exchange led by a surge of speculative and commercial buying in 
the feeder cattle market amid indications strong consumer demand 
pork futures ended the day lower with most of the selling

record number of pork bellies in cold storage for the fourth

the massive oil spill that threatens waterfowl 
and fish off the alaska coast is expected to give ammunition to 
environmentalists fighting to keep oil developers out of a pristine 
arctic wildlife refuge 
congress must approve oil exploration in the arctic national 
wildlife refuge in northeastern alaska where the petroleum industry 
believes much oil is hidden 
president bush endorsed oil drilling along a 15 million acre 
coastal strip of the refuge if it can be done within environmental 
guidelines and legislation allowing exploration passed a senate 
committee earlier this month 
but aides for senators on both sides of the issue suggested 
monday that the momentum is likely to slow considerably in light of 
the accident involving the tanker exxon valdez and the oil spill in 
the environmentally sensitive prince william sound 
white house spokesman marlin fitzwater asked monday about such 
speculation said that at this point we would not try to make 
any sweeping judgments based on the oil spill certainly not policy 
judgments 
with more than 10 million gallons of oil flowing into the sound 
it is the worst oil spill in us history and threatens waterfowl 
fish sea otter and other wildlife as well as the alaska fishing 
industry 
the exxon oil tanker that ran aground was carrying petroleum 
which had been shipped from alaskas north slope through the 
transalaska pipeline to valdez and then put aboard the tanker the 
controversy over drilling in the arctic national wildlife refuge 
involves a coastal plain just east of the north slope oil fields 
sen max baucus dmont chairman of the senate environmental 
protection subcommittee said monday the spill puts into question 
the oil industrys assurances that they can protect the environment 
the oil and gas industries have been very willing to provide 
assurances that the arctic refuge will be developed in an 
environmentally responsible manner said baucus unfortunately 
the oil spill is the latest and most tragic evidence of the gap 
that exists between past industry assurances and actual industry 
performance in preventing environmental damage 
environmental groups also suggested the accident raises 
questions whether there can be oil development and still guarantee 
environmental protection as bush has suggested in his support of 
drilling in the refuge 
this spill ought to make congress and president bush 
intensely aware that when you have development youre going to have 
environmental consequences period its a reality said syd 
butler a vice president for the wilderness society which has been 
lobbying intensely against opening the arctic refuge for drilling 
david gardner a lobbyist for the sierra club noted reports 
that the exxon tanker was being handled by a crewman who did not 
have proper credentials when it ran aground and suggested the 
episode calls into question how much priority the oil industry 
puts on environmental concerns 
its pretty clear this kind of disaster is going to happen any 
time you have oil development and oil production said gardner 
the american petroleum institute in a statement called the 
tanker spill a very regrettable situation and acknowledged it 
may have an impact on pending petroleum legislation including the 
question of drilling in the arctic refuge 
but earl ross chief spokesman for the industry lobbying group 
said it was really much too soon to tell what the reaction is 
going to be 
ever since the petroleum industry discovered the possiblity of 
large oil and gas deposits under the tundra of the northeastern 
alaska refuge there has been pressure to open the refuges coastal 
strip for exploratory drilling some estimates are that it could 
produce as much as 32 billion barrels of oil and keep the alaska 
pipeline flowing well after north slope oil is gone 
but the refuge also is the breeding ground for north americas 
largest remaining herd of migratory caribou and the habitat for 
polar bears musk oxen wolves arctic foxes and an assortment of 
waterfowl a recent congressional study suggested that oil 
development in the refuge would produce about the same 
environmental disruption as has occurred in the north slope fields 
legislation allowing drilling in the refuge cleared the senate 
energy and natural resources committee on march 16 but likely will 
be debated in the environmental committee before any floor action 
meanwhile bills also have been introduced to declare the refuge a 
formal wilderness area which would prohibit oil or gas development

mcorp said monday it would seek bankruptcy court 
protection from creditors a move that would block an attempt to 
force the sale of the troubled banking company but also might 
hamper a federal plan to rescue its failing subsidiary banks 
a filing for protection by mcorp texas secondlargest bank 
holding company would supercede a request made last week by three 
minor bondholders for an involuntary liquidation of the company 
the maneuvering comes amid a sixmonth effort by the federal 
deposit insurance corp to rescue the 25 banks owned by mcorp 
which has assets totaling about 20 billion and parent company debt 
of about 418 million 
mcorp sought federal recapitalization assistance last october 
due to deepening financial losses mcorps banks lost 903 million 
in 1988 213 million in the fourth quarter according to the fdic 
mcorp officials have met with noteholders several times since 
last fall urging them not to take action against the company 
despite its moratorium on paying debts while it tried to 
recapitalize 
mcorp deeply regrets that those noteholders ignored our pleas 
not to take premature and unnecessary action gene h bishop 
mcorp chairman and chief executive officer said in a prepared 
statement 
mirroring comments by several industry analysts robert rieke 
of rauscher pierce and refsnes inc in dallas speculated that the 
bondholders decided to seek liquidation of mcorp because of 
concerns that the fdic was moving too slowly in rescuing its banks 
i think a more expedited decision process would have resolved 
the problems and the bondholders fears rieke said there just 
hasnt been any apparent desire by the fdic to resolve the issues 
and that caused a buildup of uncertainty detrimental to all 
involved 
fdic spokesman steve katasnos in washington said fdic procedures 
have been relatively swift 
youre talking about asking someone to buy a banking 
organization that has rather substantial losses and a masssive 
portfolio to review katasnos said you dont ask someone to 
engage in a multimillion transfer without giving them ample 
opportunity to review documents and operations before they submit 
an informed bid 
the fdic has set an april 3 deadline for bids 
neither the bankruptcy petition nor the companys reorganization 
filing should affect bank business bishop said 
the chapter 7 petitioners were sn phelps amp co a greenwich 
conn bond broker that claims to hold 2 million principal amount 
in mcorp debentures and janice m eberhardt and carol r james 
each of whom claims to hold 5000 in debentures according to a 
copy of the filing provided by sn phelps 
sn phelps submitted a claim of 93750 in interest and ms 
eberhardt sought 23438 in principal payment james did not list a 
claim amount in the petition 
i walton bader a new yorkbased attorney for the holders told 
the wall street journal his clients decided to seek chapter 7 
liquidation for fear that mcorp would be forced to pump holding 
company assets into the failing banks putting the money out of 
creditors reach 
the fdic has authority to sell or otherwise dispose of insolvent 
banks closed by the comptroller of the currency but a bankruptcy 
filing would make any plan to sell the holding company subject to 
bankruptcy court approval 
the request for fdic assistance appeared to hinge on 400 
million set aside by mcorp for the deal federal regulators 
reportedly wanted that money put into the local banks before they 
would consider an assistance package 
mcorps creditors indicated they would fight such a move 
apparently fearing a repeat of last years rescue of dallasbased 
first republicbank corp regulators took over that companys 
subsidiary banks and left the holding company with almost no assets 
to pay off its creditors 
mcorp has 20 days to file for chapter 11 bankruptcy court 
reorganization after being served with the creditors petitions for 
the involuntary chapter 7 liquidation officials said 
mcorp had not received the petitions by late monday said 
spokesman george a mccane the company learned friday the petition 
had been filed in us bankruptcy court southern district of new 
york

of that in cash and the rest in securities 
the buyers would assume 14 billion in longterm debt 
at the same time pearces proposal was announced the company 
revealed it was considering a restructuring plan it said would 
boost the companys value to 25 to 29 per share the company 
refused to reveal further details of the restructuring 
a special committee of the board began weighing the proposals 
monday spokesman mick taylor said the study was expected to take a 
few weeks 
american medical led the new york stock exchanges mostactive 
list jumping 362 a share to 2150 
the company owns 55 acutecare and psychiatric hospitals in the 
united states and 20 oversease in the united kingdom switzerland 
spain greece and singapore the domestic hospitals are in 15 
states most of them in california florida and texas all have ami 
in their names

partnership including former american medical executives charles 
reilly and michael gallagher it is unrelated to roy e disneys 
shamrock holdings inc which monday abandoned a bid for polaroid 
corp 
american medical under pressure from pearce and others to boost 
flat earnings and improve its stock price has over the last two 
years sold more than 40 hospitals and laid off 2000 employees 
further efforts to pare the company down to a profitable core 
include sale of nonhospital subsidiaries including outpatient 
surgery centers amicare insurance health plans and alcohol and

most attractive hospitals said analyst rae alperstein who 
follows the company for bateman eichler hill richards inc a los 
angeles securities firm 
she called 24 a fair price apresent but suggested an 
aggressive restructuring effort that includes sale of unprofitable 
hospitals could boost the companys value into the high 20s per 
share in a year 
sale of the overseas hospitals could bring 450 million ms 
alperstein estimated 
in addition to asset sales the restructuring plan could include 
moving the headquarters out of expensive beverly hills a direct 
cash dividend to shareholders and a stock buyback said todd 
richter who follows the company for dean witter capital markets in

the securities and exchange commission said 
monday it plans administrative action against convicted former 
shearson lehman brothers inc executive mark l stahl that could

stahl who admitted to an 18 million checkkiting scheme was 
sentenced to five years in prison last year on fraud charges

exxon corp is likely to pay willingly for the 
cleanup of the alaskan oil spill to avoid controversy that could 
hurt its opportunity to explore for oil in an arctic wildlife 
refuge oil analysts said monday 
exxon is so big that even if it had to pay 100 million out of 
its own coffers for the cleanup its earnings would be lowered by 
only a nickel a share said frank knuettel an analyst at 
prudentialbache securities inc 
a bigger priority for the company is winning congressional 
approval for oil companies to explore in the pristine arctic 
national wildlife refuge in northeastern alaska knuettel said 
the oil spill from the tanker exxon valdez has slowed momentum 
for the authorization which passed a senate committee earlier this 
month aides to senators on both sides of the issue said monday 
theyd want to handle this as quickly and efficiently as 
possible to limit the damage to its image knuettel said this 
obviously is a setback 
the exxon valdez carrying 12 million barrels of north slope 
crude oil ran onto a reef 25 miles from port early friday 
estimates put the spill at 240000 barrels of oil or about 101 
million gallons making it the biggest us spill on record 
reflecting investors lack of concern about the spill exxons 
stock closed unchanged at 4450 a share in consolidated new york 
stock exchange trading 
a long delay in resumption of shipping from the valdez terminal 
could hurt exxon and other producers if it forced them to cease 
production temporarily cutting into their revenue said 
constantine fliakos an analyst at merrill lynch amp co 
as for the cleanup itself exxon is liable for the first 14 
million in damages under terms of the transalaska pipeline 
authorization act up to 86 million more could be paid out of a 
transalaska pipeline liability fund that was funded by tariffs on 
oil production by exxon british petroleum co atlantic richfield 
co and several smaller alaska oil producers 
however the administrator of the fund edwin powell said 
monday that the fund could seek reimbursement from exxon if there 
was evidence exxon was negligent in the spill 
powell who is treasurer of unocal corp said exxon might 
choose to pay the full costs up front if it wanted to avoid a 
controversy with the fund over possible negligence he said he had 
not heard from exxon on the matter 
exxon usa spokesman les rogers said exxon is a party to two 
insurancerelated agreements the tanker owners voluntary agreement 
concerning liability for oil pollution and the contract regarding a 
supplement to tanker liability for oil pollution 
but rogers failed to provide information by late monday on how 
those agreements could diminish the cost to exxon of the cleanup 
knuettel said he did not know if exxons admission that an 
unlicensed third mate was at the helm of the tanker at the time of 
the crash could affect its ability to collect on the insurance

american natural beverge corp the maker of the 
soho natural sodas brand founded 12 years ago in a brooklyn 
kitchen has been sold to the giant beverage company joseph e 
seagram amp sons the companies announced monday 
terms of the allcash deal were not disclosed 
american natural has sold more than 100 million bottles of the 
sparkling soft drink with the distinctive label named after 
manhattans artistic neighborhood the company had more than 30 
million in retail sales last year 
my dream for starting this company was to see this brand 
become a major brand said american beverage founder sophia 
collier 33 i saw that after 11 years the best way to achieve 
that was to sell the company 
collier said she decided to sell american beverage in november 
and began discussions in january with seagram the us subsidiary 
of the seagram co ltd of canada the company and its 48 employees 
will remain based in new york she said 
the company was growing but the fact is the soft drink 
industry is a multibilliondollar industry collier said 
sometimes you look over the fence and say gee if we had 
another 10 million to promote this we could really do something 
my philosophy in starting the company was to make an 
alternative to coke and pepsi when i started there were no natural 
sodas i thought just make wonderful sodas with fruit juice and 
natural ingredients 
collier an artistss daughter who wrote an autobiography at 19 
and drove trucks around new england delivering soho in the 
companys early days said she will serve as a consultant and 
spokeswoman for the soda which comes in 12 flavors and is sold in 
37 states and japan 
soho won a dispute with anheuserbusch inc in 1987 over the 
sodas distinctive diamondshaped checkerboard logo which it 
introduced in 1982 anheuserbusch agreed in an outofcourt 
settlement to drop a similar logo it had used for its own seltzer 
product 
soho is latest addition to seagrams empire of sprits wines 
coolers and juices the companys brands include chivas regal 
crown royal and seagrams vo canadian whiskies mumm and 
perrierjouet champagnes martell cognac barton amp guestier wines 
and seagrams coolers 
last year seagram agreed to buy tropicana pure premium orange 
juice from its parent beatrice us food corp for 12 billion 
soho natural sodas have developed a loyal and growing 
following in every market they are sold said c richard coffey 
president of the seagram beverage co of which soho will become a 
unit 
they have achieved an enormous success because soho sodas are 
classic products sold with classic style he said 
seagram reported a 1988 profit of 5895 million on sales of 
51 billion

motorola inc has dropped a federal 
patentinfringement lawsuit filed here against hitachi ltd but 
has filed a virtually identical lawsuit in austin texas officials 
of the two companies said monday 
the lawsuit filed in january in us district court here alleged 
that hitachi was engaging in unfair competition with its new h8 
microprocessor 
hitachi does not know why motorola no longer wishes to pursue 
its claims in chicago the site of motorolas national 
headquarters said a statement issued by tokyobased hitachi from 
tarrytown ny home of its hitachi america ltd subsidiary 
hitachi believes chicago remains the proper place for these 
lawsuits and it will resist motorolas tactical maneuvers to avoid 
the chicago courts 
but spokesman charles sengstock of motorola which is based in 
suburban schaumburg said in a telephone interview that motorola 
has two plants in austin that make the microprocessors involved in 
the lawsuit 
he said the procedural move to austin focuses the matter 
to the center of our microprocessor activity and the site of 
all the documents evidence and witnesses 
hitachi also has filed a lawsuit against motorola in the chicago 
court alleging that the motorola 68hc11 microcontroller infringes 
on a hitachi patent 
sengstock said motorola is seeking to have the cases combined in 
the federal court in texas 
motorola has said that the alleged unfair competition began 
shortly after motorola granted a patent license to hitachi for 
certain motorola microprocessors in may 1986 
the company said the hitachi h8 microprocessor series infringes 
on at least four motorola patents 
hitachi has denied any wrongdoing 
sengstock said motorola would seek an injunction to stop 
distribution of the disputed hitachi microprocessors in the united 
states the lawsuit also seeks unspecified damages he said

control and arithmetic functions in a computer they often contain 
hundreds of thousands of microscopic transistors on silicon chips

barry minkow who once was hailed as a 
financial whiz kid was sentenced to 25 years in prison and ordered 
to pay 26 million restitution for fraud by a judge who called him 
a charismatic liar 
us district judge dickran tevrizian handed minkow 23 the 
maximum penalty sought by the government 
youre dangerous tevrizian told the 23yearold minkow 
because you have this gift of gab this ability to communicate 
and you dont have a conscience 
minkow who founded the nowdefunct zzzz best carpet cleaning 
company was convicted of 57 counts of securities credit card and 
mail fraud on dec 14 the governments sentencing memorandum 
described minkow as a remorseless liar and thief whose schemes cost 
victims more than 100 million 
in arguments during mondays hearing assistant us attorney 
james asperger said minkow would probably serve only a third of any 
sentence imposed 
in pleading for a lenient sentence minkow compared himself to 
former financier ivan boesky who is serving a threeyear prison 
sentence for his role in the wall street insider trading scandal 
this is a great day for this country said minkow clad in 
blue prisonissue shirt and pants this is a great day for 
justice this is how america works 
he commended the fbi the securities and exchange commission 
and the us attorneys who prosecuted him saying they got the 
right guy they got the guilty guy 
i see victims here today he said turning toward the 
audience i can only say to them how sorry i am and im going to 
get what ive got coming every bit of it 
but the judge was unmoved by minkows plea or a similar one by 
defense attorney david kenner who asked for a sentence of eight to 
10 years and psychological counseling for his client 
that would be a joke snapped tevrizian here is someone 
who has corrupted the financial system here is someone who has 
lied and cheated that sentence would be a slap on the wrist 
after minkows appeal tevrizian told him you tell me youre 
sorry and i think is he trying to clean my carpet or what 
the judge ordered that minkow serve five years probation 
following his release and that the probation would be conditional 
on his paying the 26 million restitution as well as any back taxes 
or civil judgments against him the judge also ordered him to 
participate in a drug dependency program 
kenner said outside court that he would try to get minkows 
sentence reduced 
tevrizian has sentenced 10 other defendants in the case to terms 
of a month to eight years 
in their sentencing memo asperger and assistant us attorney 
gordon greenberg said minkow carried out a fiveyear crime wave 
that amounted to a searchanddestroy mission aimed at the trust 
and integrity of our financial institutions securities markets and
