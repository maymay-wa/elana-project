president turgut ozal of turkey said tuesday 
neighboring iraqs military strength has been exaggerated and he 
doesnt expect iraq to invade either saudi arabia or turkey 
iraqi president saddam hussein lost that chance to attack 
his neighbors with the arrival of us forces in saudi arabia ozal 
told a national press club luncheon 
recalling that it took iraqs army eight years to gain the upper 
hand in its war against iran despite backing from the soviet 
union france and most of the west ozal asked how can you call 
that iraq a strong army 
james dobbins deputy undersecretary of state for european and 
canadian affairs said ozal gave president bush a similar 
unflattering assessment of iraqi military prowess 
dobbins said ozal stated that public perception of saddams army 
being one of the strongest in the world was simply an exaggerated 
concern that youre not dealing with the kinds of crises the 
western world has dealt with in the past i dont think he was 
saying itll be a runover 
at the national press club ozal said neither he nor bush knew 
how long it would take for the economic embargo and other sanctions 
to force saddam to retreat his own view was maybe fourfive 
months maybe later well see 
asked if he took seriously saddams threats to attack oilfields 
in saudi arabia turkey and other neighboring countries resisting 
iraq ozal replied i never thought he was going to attack 
because i thought he was going to take kuwait and stop there if 
saddam had met no resistance he would stay in kuwait controlling 
the oil of both iraq and kuwait and probably have a tremendous 
effect on the rest of the gulf ozal said 
why should he attack saudi arabia why turkey he asked 
ozal dismissed as speculative a reporters suggestion that 
turkey wants to repossess oilrich mosul province from iraq after 
the gulf crisis although the ottoman empire considered it part of 
turkey the league of nations gave mosul to britishruled iraq 
after world war i and i think its all over he added

crime laboratory results given to 
police investigating five student slayings failed to link any of 
several suspects to the killings a newspaper reported 
its uncertain whether the test results received last week 
actually cleared any suspects or if they just failed to support 
existing suspicions the gainesville sun said in its wednesday 
editions 
police last week increased night patrols in the area where the 
college students were slain 
the newspaper quoted unidentified law enforcement sources as 
saying the beefedup patrols were ordered after an investigative 
task force received the results of tests and after the apparent 
failure of intense searches of woods frequented by the edward lewis 
humphrey humphrey an 18yearold university of florida freshman 
has been mentioned most often as a suspect though police say they 
have eight suspects in the case 
the tests didnt link any of the eight to the crimes the 
newspaper said 
investigators have taken pubic hair and blood samples from 
humphrey and stephen michael bates 30 the only other suspect 
whose name has been made public both are jailed on unrelated 
charges and neither has been charged in the gainesville murders 
tests were under way on semen blood and a single pubic hair 
found at one or more of the murder scenes and on a knife found in a 
milk jug at humphreys home in indialantic 
humphreys public defender jr russo told the sun he didnt 
know about any test results 
task force members refused to comment on lab tests or on what 
the findings might mean about humphreys viability as a suspect 
the newspaper said associated press attempts to reach task force 
members for comment on the report werent immediately successful 
the nude mutilated bodies of sonja larson 18 and christina 
powell 17 were found aug 26 in their apartment near the 
university of florida campus the next day the decapitated body of 
18yearold christa hoyt was found in her apartment nearby 
on aug 28 the bodies of manuel taboada and tracy paules both 
23 were found in an apartment they shared all were students at 
either the university of florida or santa fe community college 
humphrey is being held on 1 million bond in the brevard county 
jail in sharpes he has been charged with the aug 30 beating of 
his 79yearold grandmother police have searched the woods near 
his gainesville apartment and have executed search warrants on his 
residences and car 
bates 30 who is being held in polk county is charged with a 
burglary in which he woke a woman and her daughter and threatened 
them with a knife

at age 25 the pillsbury doughboy is on a 
roll 
a new series of television ads show the pudgy figure playing 
air guitar wailing on a harmonica rapping and zipping around 
on a skateboard 
this is a guy having fun doing what hes doing said craig 
evanich vice president of marketing in minneapolisbased pillsbury 
incs prepareddough division 
but other than updating his song repertoire the doughboy also 
known as poppin fresh hasnt changed much since he first popped 
out of a can of readytobake dough in 1965 
to celebrate the doughboys 25th birthday the downtown 
pillsbury center atrium will be transformed thursday into 
doughland entertainer steve allen will toast the doughboys 
birthday 
the doughboy was created when an advertising executive 
fantasized about what would pop out of a tube of refrigerated 
dough 
ads show the white doughboy as a kitchen helper 
hes not an authority he doesnt come in the kitchen and tell 
people what to do evanich said 
for the last 16 years the doughboys voice has been provided by 
jobe cerny a chicagoarea actor cerny said he tries to infuse 
some of his own personality into poppin fresh 
hes warm cute and just a likable guy my job is to try and 
help keep him that way cerny said 
poppin fresh has become a part of pop culture in 1972 
playthings magazine named him toy of the year after pillsbury 
introduced a doll doughboy and in 1987 advertising age declared 
him americas mostloved character 
the doughboys elfish personality is like that of the magical 
helpers of ancient myths said ellen havre weis founder and 
executive director of the museum of modern mythology in san 
francisco 
its very symbolic of the home and hearth weis said hes 
dough brought to life

from their shabby camp on this 
arid hillside guatemalan refugees can see the green hills of their 
homeland for eight years their dream of returning has been 
nurtured like an ember 
the dream has helped them survive the precarious life of the 
camps and memories of the terror that drove them here but year 
after year the political violence of their homeland has eroded the 
dream 
theyve been here so long that the mexican government has 
offered them permanent settlements that puts the refugees in a 
painful dilemma whether to choose relative security in a foreign 
land or the uncertainty and violence of their home 
everyone says they are going home someday said pablo 
farias a psychiatrist who works with refugees 
but after a while you realize it is sort of a speech when 
you get past that you start getting to the real sadness 
the people of las cieneguitas are among the tens of thousands 
who fled in the early 1980s during guatemalas scorchedearth 
campaign to wipe out a leftist insurgency and depopulate remote 
northern war zones 
we didnt want to leave our homes said 55yearold ramiro 
velazquez de arturo but we didnt want to die 
about 46000 refugees ended up in unsupervised camps near the 
border in chiapas mexicos southernmost state 
in 1984 they were offered permanent villages in two other 
states campeche and quintana roo more than half refused despite 
the prospect of jobs or land of better housing and education 
they chose to stay in miserable camps such as las cieneguitas a 
collection of rickety shacks without water or electricity where 
diseases such as typhoid are epidemic 
those who stayed in the camps are the ones who want to go 
home they have been keeping alive the hope said sister lucia 
jimenez a nun who has worked with the refugees for a decade 
the whole meaning of who they are of what has happened to 
them is linked to being a refugee farias said 
the 23000 exiles in chiapas most ff them indians are now 
dispersed in 123 camps some with only a handful of families las 
cieneguitas with 1600 people is one of the largest 
the refugees survive on international aid and what little day 
labor they find it isnt much chiapas is a poor state where 
mexicans fight mexicans for land 
there is intense competition for the natural resources we are 
piling up problems between the mexican and refugee communities 
warned jorge santistevan regional representative of the un high 
commissioner for refugees 
mexican officials recently proposed creating a handful of 
villages with farmland and projects aimed at selfsufficiency 
within a few years permanent residence and citizenship for 
children born in mexico would be part of the deal 
its a recognition that things arent going to get better in 
guatemala and that these people wont be going home said victor 
osorio spokesman for an umbrella group of 16 private refugee 
assistance groups in mexico city 
although they resisted resettlement in 1984 the refugees in 
chiapas are considering the proposal 
it is interesting said ricardo kurtz a 26yearold 
kanjobal indian who serves on a refugee negotiating commission 
it would mean better health services and education 
the commission on which kurtz serves was elected in 1987 to hold 
repatriation talks with guatemalas government it is a symbol of 
the unity and political awareness the refugees found in exile 
they are not the same people who left guatemala said 
santistevan the un representative they are far more 
sophisticated 
the commission has drawn up a brief list of conditions for 
returning to guatemala including guarantees of safety and 
restoration of land 
for a campesino the land is like your mother velazquez de 
arturo told a recent visitor here 
the exiles many of whom cannot read or write keep close track 
of events back home most camps have at least one shortwave radio 
and broadcasts from guatemala and the bbc are carefully monitored 
the news is bad 
there has been an upsurge in the kidnapping torture and murder 
of peasant student labor and human rights activists the army 
still occupies isolated areas although the scorchedearth 
campaign has ended 
guatemalas weak civilian government has not been able to meet 
the refugees demands or gain their trust 
the exiles are also shocked by the campaign now under way to 
chose a successor to president vinicio cerezo who took office in 
1986 after decades of military rule 
efrain rios montt a brigadier general who took power after a 
1982 coup is doing well in the polls despite a legal ruling that 
as a former dictator he cannot serve as president 
its incredible that he would run said velazquez de arturo 
it was in his times that most of the massacres took place 
velazquez de arturo knows his village suffered three army 
massacres before the inhabitants fled en masse in 1982 
he says he cannot forget burying the mutilated bodies of friends 
and neighbors the burnedout ruins of their homes almost everyone 
in the camps lives with such memories 
we have peace here if nothing else he said 
over the years only a few thousand refugees have gone back to 
guatemala farias recalls one who committed suicide the night 
before he was to return 
whatever way it goes for these people deciding to go back or 
deciding to assimilate i think there is going to be a lot more 
suffering he said 
the balance they have struck is very fragile

state offices and even voted for the budget that financed the 
legislative office construction millers statement said 
miller has been lieutenant governor for 16 years but isakson 
isnt a newcomer to state government either the prosperous atlanta 
real estate executive has been a state legislator since 1976 
miller is a former marine rifle range instructor who talks tough 
on drugs while promising a sales tax exemption for food 
isakson has a reputation as a solid nononsense legislator and 
his contacts in the business community are counted as a plus 
but isakson must overcome the momentum miller built during his 
drive for the democratic nomination and state voters preference 
for democrats in top state offices 
without question its still zells to lose said atlanta 
pollster claibourne darden 
isaksons media consultant robert goodman disagrees saying 
the democrat is vulnerable 
miller has been running as a media candidate trying to pose as 
the champion of change said goodman but zell miller is part 
of the old boy network as you will see as the campaign evolves 
miller has political ties to highway builders and other 
interests and until this year used a lakeside lot leased from a 
utility 
miller outnumbers isakson 21 in staff and money political 
consultant james carville heads the democrats campaign stressing 
opposition research 
it is hard for somebody to hit you when you have your fist in 
their face carville has been quoted as saying 
president bush plans to host a 1500percouple fundraiser for 
isakson who had raised 2 million through july compared with 44 
million for miller 
miller swept away five democratic primary challengers 
including atlantas former mayor andrew young by promising to 
legalize state lotteries 
miller said his campaign emerged from the primary in good shape 
and is as strong as garlic in a milkshake 
isakson had little trouble dispatching three rivals to win the 
gop nomination then took a back seat while miller and young fought 
a runoff battle 
miller usually has allowed his aides to answer isakson and has 
been adept at focusing attention on his favorite issues especially 
his proposal for a state lottery 
when the candidates appeared together at a forum before 
educators miller stole the headlines by proposing that parents be 
allowed to choose which public schools their children should 
attend 
state spending is a key issue for isakson who for years as 
house republican leader criticized georgias spending process as 
lacking discipline and priorities often the dissent fell on deaf 
ears because the republican minority had little legislative impact 
on state government and because of isaksons penchant of attacking 
with a barrage of statistics 
this year democrats have served the issue to him on a platter 
just a year after passing the biggest tax increase in state history 
a onecent sales tax increase to finance prisons schools and 
health needs the state must cut spending by 332 million because 
of an economic slowdown 
isakson still employs some of his old techniques of responding 
to the issue with detail recently releasing a 13page budget 
policy statement but he also has gotten media savvy in the age of 
the 30second sound bite 
its up to johnny to use the old george patton technique 
attack attack attack said darden if johnny doesnt hes 
gone he has to attack and show zell is not the one to vote for 
and by default johnny is

portofspain trinidad ap sorry for inconvenience caused 
by the criminal acts of frenzied looters reads the sign in the 
window of the closed hometown pharmacy well be back as soon as 
possible 
the suburban drug store was among scores of businesses plundered 
after moslem militants stormed parliament and the governmentrun tv 
station on july 27 and took the prime minister and more than 50 
others hostage 
nearly two months later trinidadians are still feeling 
aftershocks of the sixday siege and accompanying looting that left 
24 people dead and 500 wounded on this tiny nation of 12 million 
inhabitants off the coast of venezuela 
the fighting delvered a shock to the ailing trinidadian 
economy causing an estimated 60 million damage to the devastated 
main shopping district of portofspain tourism not surprisingly 
was also hurt 
but there is a touch of irony in the fact that only hours after 
rebel yasin abu bakr and his followers surrendered aug 1 iraq 
invaded kuwait sending oil prices skyrocketing trinidad produces 
just under 1 percent of the worlds oil 
the worst longterm damage may be to the nations sense of 
itself as a land of britishstyle democracy multiracial harmony 
oil wealth cricket and calypso 
for harmony pharmacy owner jeffrey marchack who lost his entire 
inventory of 100000 worth of drugs and merchandise the episode 
has meant a decision to install an iron grille in the front window 
and a cashiers cage 
such security measures didnt seem necessary before he said 
nostalgically because we were always known to be happygolucky 
peaceloving people 
the myth of exceptionalism has been blown apart said selwyn 
ryan a sociologist and political pollster at the university of the 
west indies the myth that were a nonviolent society is just 
that a myth 
industry minister bhoe tewarie said bakr and his jamaat 
almuslimeen society of moslems were a group of extremists 
with no popular support and i think trinidad and tobago proved 
to the world that it is a very stable democracy that was threatened 
but never shaken by the events of july 27 
but fearing that supporters of bakr and 113 other jailed rebels 
might be plotting another attack the government has extended a 
state of emergency until midnovember the proclamation gives 
security forces unrestricted rights of search and arrest 
by day the capital of portofspain once again teems with 
shoppers street vendors and clogged traffic residents are growing 
tired of being restricted to their homes at night under a 9 
pmto5 am curfew 
we cannot expect that their sense of humor which as been 
bearing up quite nicely until now can be maintained for undefined 
periods the trinidad guardian said in an editorial urging an end 
to the curfew 
police usually armed only with billy clubs in this former 
british colony now patrol with automatic rifles soldiers wearing 
berets and camouflage jungle fatigues guard the bulletscarred 
parliament building and television station 
the capitals major hotels are open but with mostly empty 
rooms 
bulldozers and dump trucks remove tons of rubble from the main 
shopping district where fires destroyed almost every building in a 
twosquareblock area 
the government is offering business loans and planning to 
redesign the district which had become badly rundown 
but rebuilding could take months if not years 
industry minister tewarie insists the coup attempt would not 
have any lasting affect the economy tourism was hurt in the short 
term he said but the industry accounts for a tiny proportion of 
the nations wealth 
despite the boom in oil prices tewarie said the government has 
no plans to significantly increase production because it is wary of 
increasing its dependence on oil income 
trinidad has been gripped by recession since oil prices 
collapsed in 1983 bakr 48 a former policeman who converted to 
islam and drew followers mainly among poor urban blacks blamed 
prime minister arthur nr robinson for the widespread poverty that 
resulted 
robinson 64 was shot in the left leg after the takeover of 
parliament he has returned to work and now walks with a cane 
the prime minister who had introduced wage freezes spending 
cuts and layoffs to revitalize the economy had become highly 
unpopular before the coup attempt he remains in danger of losing 
the next election due next year 
bakr and his men face a string of charges including murder and 
treason which carry the death penalty a preliminary hearing was 
to begin today in a converted gym 
the fbi has charged an american moslem louis haneef of pompano 
beach fla with supplying assault rifles ammunition and other

five years and 15 million ago the federal 
government issued its only official earthquake prediction the 
central california town of parkfield would be severely shaken by 
1993 
recent rumblings suggest the forecast soon may come true 
they definitely elevate my belief that the earthquake is 
likely to happen in the next few months said evelyn roeloffs 
scientist in charge of the us geological surveys parkfield 
earthquake prediction experiment 
after a threeyear lull seismic activity increased during the 
summer and particularly this month near tiny parkfield the town is 
halfway between los angeles and san francisco in grassy oakdotted 
ranchland of the cholame valley which straddles the mighty san 
andreas fault 
it was in the valley that actor james dean died in a 1955 car 
crash 
moderate to strong quakes measuring 55 to 63 on the richter 
scale have ruptured a 20milelong section of the fault near 
parkfield roughly every 22 years since 1857 the most recent was in 
1966 the quakes caused little damage in the valley where about 
200 people now live 
the temblors regularity prompted a 1985 geological survey 
prediction that another magnitude6 quake was 95 percent likely 
during a 10year period centered around january 1988 which meant 
by no later than january 1993 
the parkfield prediction is the only one ever issued by the 
federal government and ndorsed by california and federal 
scientific panels 
the geological survey has spent 15 million installing scores of 
seismometers and other sensors and instruments near parkfield 
making it the most heavily instrumented piece of fault in the 
world survey spokeswoman pat jorgenson said 
researchers hope the sensors will help them recognize changes in 
the earth in the months days hours and minutes before the 
predicted magnitude6 jolt allowing them to issue a shortterm 
public warning 
im not hoping to rain death and destruction on parkfield but 
im hoping we can have the event we set up all this instrumentation 
to catch roeloffs said by phone from menlo park 
the predicted quake is not expected to cause significant damage 
said richard andrews chief deputy director of californias office 
of emergency services 
he said it could shake things off shelves and damage chimneys in 
parkfield and surrounding towns such as paso robles avenal 
coalinga and atascadero 
the streams of scientists visiting parkfield spurred rancher 
jack varians family to open the towns only cafe and start 
building a fourroom motel 
a sign outside the restaurant says parkfield cafe parkfield 
calif earthquake capital of the world be here when it happens 
varians 27yearold son john is excited about the impending 
quake but i just want it to wait until march until the motels 
open 
ill be darned if im going to hope for an earthquake said 
parkfield school teacher duane hamann who works parttime making 
measurements for scientists things are going to fly all over the 
place 
to help people protect themselves the geological survey and 
state officials established a warning system in which alerts are 
triggered by various combinations of small quakes and other signs 
the highest alert known as levela will spur officials to 
issue a public warning that the predicted quake is at least 37 
percent likely within three days 
since 1986 there have been no levela or b alerts 22 levelc 
alerts and 53 leveld alerts roeloffs said 
the latest levelc alert a warning that the quake is between 3 
and 11 percent likely within three days was issued sept 9 
roeloffs said the alert was triggered by a magnitude33 quake 
north of parkfield on sept 9 and an unusual rise in well water 
levels 
another 33 quake rattled the area sept 10 the small quakes 
were followed by numerous aftershocks and by magnitude22 quakes 
sept 14 and 15 
there also was a steady increase in magnitude3 quakes all 
summer farther northwest of parkfield a pattern roeloffs called 
similar to the seismicity in the six months before the 1966 
earthquake 
geological survey scientists have said there is a 2 percent to 
10 percent chance the parkfield quake could grow into or trigger a 
major magnitude7 jolt 
if that happened parkfield and surrounding towns might 
experience considerable damage especially to unreinforced brick 
buildings according state officials slight damage might occur as 
far away as san luis obispo hollister bakersfield and fresno 
in 1857 a moderate parkfield quake was followed within hours by 
an earthquake exceeding magnitude 8 that ruptured a 200mile 
stretch of the san andreas from south of parkfield to the los 
angeles area recent studies however show that is extremely 
unlikely to happen after the next parkfield quake 
other studies raise doubts about the parkfield prediction 
previous parkfield quakes around magnitude6 happened in 1857 
1881 1901 1922 but then the pattern was broken with one in 1934 
10 years early however the next magnitude6 quake waited until 
1966 seeming to restore the original pattern 
geological survey geophysicist jim savage argues that 
uncertainty created by the timing of the 1934 quake means the 
likelihood the parkfield quake will happen by 1993 is only 60 
percent

the metropolitan opera opened its season with 
puccinis muchloved melodic la boheme starring mirella freni 
and placido domingo 
both were magnificent in the leading roles 
with mrs george bush prince rainier and his son prince albert 
in the state box the evening began with the audience standing for 
an orchestral piece unfamiliar to most of them the national anthem 
of monaco where rainier is head of state that was followed by 
the star spangled banner 
usually met artistic director james levine conducts on opening 
night but monday night christian badea held the baton he took the 
important duets and arias of the fourth act slower than usual that 
made them especially gentle and poignant 
the slower tempo began with rodolfo domingo ad marcello 
brian schnexnayder lamenting the loss of their girlfriends it 
continued with colline julien robbins saying goodbye to the 
overcoat hes about to sell and the final duet of rodolfo and mimi 
miss freni 
miss freni who made her met debut as mimi in the first week of 
the 196566 season is amazing she sounded incredibly young at the 
beginning of the opera and with her small waist looked young 
unlike some singers who only sound good singing loud her voice is 
even more lovely when shes singing quietly and sweetly as she did 
all through act 4 on mimis deathbed 
domingo was fine though a couple of times he slipped from his 
best voice he was charming blowing out his candle so that he and 
mimi are together in the dark then shrugging as seen in the 
follow spotlight he and miss freni conveyed that there was a 
chemistry between them near the end of act 1 when theyre 
supposed to kiss a big smack was heard 
baritone richard cowan a native of euclid ohio graduate of 
indiana university and winner of several vocal prizes made a 
sterling met debut as schaunard the fourth bohemian roommate in a 
paris garret cowan sang schaunard in a recent la boheme film 
and will sing the title role of don giovanni at the met in 
october 
all the bohemians sounded young and strong schnexnayder was 
especially impressive barbara daniels sang musetta well but 
performed the part as though doing a zsa zsa gabor imitation 
franco zeffirellis production from 1981 has held up well the 
attic room is shown to be tiny by having the roof of the building 
its above much bigger and sloping toward the audience it looks as 
though the met still has 218 people walking around paris latin 
quarter at the beginning of act 2 
mrs bushs gown was red with long sleeves and a bodice shot 
with gold threads with it she wore a triple strand of pearls the 
formally dressed audience chose in general to be attractively and 
conservatively dressed this year 
a champagne supper on the grand tier of the met followed for 650 
guests who paid 1250 each performance tickets ranged from 35 to 
500

president bush will veto any attempt by 
congress to postpone the 85 billion in grammrudman spending cuts 
that loom next week unless a budget deal is reached white house 
officials said monday 
the compromise remained elusive because of a dispute over 
whether to slash the capital gains tax rate the bush 
administration insisted it would not agree to higher income tax 
rates on the wealthy a demand democrats were making in exchange 
for the capital gains tax reduction 
as the standoff continued the specter of massive cuts in 
federal spending grew nearer and the administration promised to let 
them take effect without a budget deal 
were tminus seven said presidential spokesman marlin 
fitzwater referring to the number of days before the slashes 
occur were sticking with it and still talking 
administration officials and congressional leaders held an 
evening meeting that lasted until nearly 1230 am tuesday trying 
to work out a fiveyear 500 billion deficitreduction package 
with the new fiscal year beginning next monday the two sides 
remain locked in a budget stalemate that has persisted all year 
were making progress in cutting spending but were not there 
yet white house chief of staff john sununu said after the 
session 
negotiators continued to reveal little about the details of 
their closeddoor discussions the principal hangup remained a 
dispute over a reduction in the capital gains tax rate which bush 
wants and democrats oppose 
currently capital gains gains from the sale of assets such 
as corporate stock or houses are taxed just like ordinary income 
white house budget chief richard darman said the administration 
would continue to oppose higher income tax rates on the wealthy 
were not shifting our position on anything he said why 
should we 
senate minority leader bob dole rkan had said sunday that 
republicans were looking for a tax boost on the wealthy that 
democrats would accept in exchange for a capital gains tax 
reduction it was unclear whether he meant to include higher tax 
rates on the rich a position gop bargainers have fought all year 
frustration with the stalled budget talks caused debate on every 
bill brought to the house floor monday to deteriorate into an 
argument over which party was to blame for the budget impasse 
a day intended for action on 37 noncontroversial bills became 
one of parliamentary delays by republicans angry because a vote on 
the budget had not been scheduled on this weeks calendar 
democrats said a vote couldnt be scheduled on a bill that didnt 
exist 
this place is in total disarray said rep gerald solomon 
rny 
oct 1 is the day the grammrudman law will automatically impose 
85 billion in cuts in the 12 trillion federal budget an amount 
that would hobble many federal programs 
its also the day the government will run out of money because 
the budget gridlock has blocked all spending bills 
democratic congressional leaders planned to begin moving 
legislation through the house on tuesday temporarily providing 
financing to the government 
house speaker thmas s foley dwash said if a budget 
compromise is reached the legislation would also delay the 
grammrudman spending reductions the postponement is expected to 
last through oct 20 to give lawmakers a chance to enact the budget 
into law 
but foley cautioned that without a budget pact the house might 
not try to delay the grammrudman slashes 
if there is no agreement we will have a different 
condition foley told reporters we dont have any policy at 
the moment that isnt directed toward an agreement 
even if the house measure failed to delay the grammrudman cuts 
the senate could add the provision later in the week 
by sending bush a measure temporarily rolling back the automatic 
cuts democrats would put the president in the position of having 
to decide whether to hold off on the cuts slashes and perhaps 
taking the blame for them 
white house officials reasoned that by refusing to put off the 
grammrudman reductions they could pressure negotiators to work 
out a deal 
if you get into the business of suspending and suspending and 
suspending well be at it for 114 years said darman one of 
the bargainers

overall its been a pretty good year for dry 
edible beans says the agriculture department 
department bean counters always refer to them as dry and edible 
to distinguish the pintos navies and small reds from green beans 
which arent dry and castor beans which arent edible 
as of sept 1 total dry edible bean production is expected to 
be 314 million hundredweight the most since the record 1981 
harvest of 328 million hundredweight 
heat and drought conditions took a toll during the summer in the 
northern great plains or 1990 output would probably have exceeded 
the old peak 
even so prospects for this years bean harvest are much 
improved from 1989s harvest of 243 million hundredweight and the 
droughtriddled 1988 production of 193 million 
catherine r greene of the departments economic research 
service said recent industry reports show excellent growth 
conditions for much of the 1990 bean crop exceptions she said 
include drought areas of the northern plains and california 
greene said monday in a telephone interview that the aggregate 
prices of dry beans in the 199091 marketing year are expected to 
decline because of the larger harvest and a buildup in bean 
inventories 
in 198990 the season average price at the farm was about 28 
per hundredweight or 28 cents per pound during the summer farm 
prices rose to record levels averaging nearly 33 per 
hundredweight 
greene did not make any new price predictions but noted that her 
agencys most recent projection showed that bean prices might 
tumble to less than 20 per hundredweight over the 199091 season 
dry beans have been up for a long time she said 
according to usda analysts the harvested acreage jumped 26 
percent from last year to about 21 million acres with north 
dakota accounting for about half of the increase 
north dakota production which is mostly pinto and navy beans 
was indicated in september at 54 million hundredweight compared 
with 246 million in 1989 and 27 million in 1988 
another big dry bean producer is michigan with production 
estimated at 525 million hundredweight compared with 45 million 
last year and 214 million in 1988 
nebraska ranked third is expected to produce nearly 466 
million hundredweight up from less than 35 million in 1989 and 
376 million in 1988 
other commercial dry bean producers include california 
colorado idaho kansas minnesota montana new mexico new york 
oregon texas utah washington and wyoming 
 
washington ap an experimental oral vaccine to control 
coccidiosis a parasitic disease of chickens is being tested by 
the agriculture department 
so far says microbiologist mark c jenkins of the department 
agricultural research service the vaccine appears virtually 100 
percent effective in protecting young chickens against the 
disease 
jenkins who heads the research team at the agencys protozoan 
diseases laboratory in beltsville md said none of the 200 
chickens orally vaccinated became ill when exposed to the coccidial 
parasite 
the vaccine consists mainly of a preparation made from an 
ineffective stage of the parasite that has been bombarded with 
xrays making the organism sterile so it cant reproduce but it 
is still alive and can penetrate a chickens intestines 
our theory is that when the chickens are fed the sterilized 
coccidial parasite they react by producing antibodies and immune 
cells jenkins said in a report released monday this protects 
them from infection when exposed to diseasecausing parasites 
coccidiosis costs us poultry farmers more than 300 million a 
year in lost weight gain and medication he said most infected 
birds usually look healthy but the parasite prevents them from 
absorbing nutrients from the gut causing a sort of slow 
starvation 
scientists said the vaccine although promising is still a few 
years from practical use it will require at least another year of 
laboratory testing and then extensive field studies to make sure it 
is effective in large commercial flocks 
most poultry farmers now control coccidiosis by medicating the 
feed but the parasites often develop resistance to the drugs and 
new medications have to be developed 
 
washington ap us farm exports are expected to drop next 
year as foreign production competes with sales of grain and other 
products the agriculture department reports 
the departments economic research service said monday that a 
drop in corn exports in the fiscal year that begins oct 1 will 
help lead the overall decline 
us corn exports are expected to fall 7 million tons more 
than 275 million bushels as overseas customers replace us corn 
with competitors feed wheat the report said wheat prices are 
expected to average lower in 199091 due to larger crops but 
higher soybean prices will help offset some of this decline 
overall farm exports in the current year are estimated at about 
1485 million metric tons worth about 40 billion both up slightly 
from 198889 
the report did not include any figures to show us export 
values and volume in 199091 the departments first official 
export estimates for next year will be issued in late november

jordan is wounded and its leaders are 
confused and unable to understand what they see as an acrimonious 
campaign against a tiny kingdom struggling to survive in peace 
we feel that since the americans and the europeans and the 
allies of the united states for that matter cannot punish iraq 
what they are trying to do is punish jordan we dont know the 
reason behind it said deputy foreign minister mutasem bilbeisi 
western diplomats contend privately that jordan has not done 
enough to condemn iraq for its aug 2 invasion of kuwait but they 
agree the punishment does not fit the crime 
jordans already faltering economy has been driven to its knees 
by the persian gulf crisis 
perhaps jordan was slow to adhere to the embargo but the world 
has been slower still with the aid jordan needs to survive the 
countrys leaders say 
you cannot deny the fact that we could have made billions if 
we wanted to out of this crisis bilbeisi said in an interview 
jordan would only have to violate the sanctions and continue to 
deal with iraq a country that accounted for about 40 percent of 
jordans trade he said 
i dont like to insinuate anything but there were monies thatwwere 
easy to obtain under the table jordan could have done it we 
could have solved all our economic problems if we had taken a 
position contrary to our position 
but at what expense bilbeisi asked i dont think the 
government is going to defy the whole world and break the 
sanctions 
bilbeisi and other jordanian officials speaking on condition 
they not be identified try to portray jordan as a voice of reason 
in a world gone mad 
like the united states jordan has called for iraq to withdraw 
from kuwait and for a restoration of the emir 
but it also has tried to prevent the deployment of foreign 
troops in a region with bitter memories of colonalism and foreign 
domination 
king hussein has tried to slow the steady march toward war by 
seeking to negotiate an arab solution to the crisis 
but western diplomats contend his efforts are unrealistic that 
none of the proposals meet even the minimum requirements of the 
un security council resolutions seeking to force iraq to 
relinquish kuwait 
the main principles inherent in any of these peace proposals 
would be the withdrawal of iraqi troops from kuwait and the return 
of a legitimate government to kuwait said bilbeisi 
but whether this meets with the resolutions of the security 
council or not is beside the point because we think some of the 
resolutions of the security council are detrimental to any peace 
effort because they are so tight said bilbeisi 
he said the word unconditional in un resolutions makes 
peace efforts more difficult 
iraq and kuwait had a border dispute even before the invasion 
jordan is recommending that an iraqi withdrawal to the line of 
dispute rather than the preattack border would be a good 
starting point for negotiations 
lets be pragmatic he saddam hussein went to war to protect 
his interests in those oil fields said bilbeisi 
if we convince the man to withdraw to that point of dispute 
and then if we can manage or can arrange negotiations between 
kuwaitis and iraqis and if the kuwaitis agree to a new boundary 
between them then i dont think any country will object to this 
he said 
but diplomats echoing the comments of british prime minister 
margaret thatcher argue that king hussein failed the first test 
of principles by not publicly condemning iraq 
the king has said only that he opposes the acquisition of 
territory by force 
our position is that we cannot condemn and mediate at the same 
time said bilbeisi 
popular support for iraq is overwhelming in jordan bilbeisi and 
others argue that the king could not possibly take a harder stance 
or send troops to join a multinational force in saudi arabia 
jordanian officials argue it is easy for a pacific ocean state 
or one in middle europe to comply fully with the un sanctions on 
trade with iraq 
but they say it is something else for jordan which has no firm 
guarantees of foreign aid and stands to lose 2 billion this year 
alone because of the crisis no one objected to jordans relations 
with iraq when its neighbor was fighting iran and seen as a 
deterrent to the spread of islamic fundamentalism in the region 
the officials say 
bilbeisi also claimed that some in other countries were doing 
more to help iraq but not being subjected to the same condemnation 
he said most of the smuggling in the world now is taking 
place between turkey and iraq between iran and iraq and youll be 
surprised that the best business of smuggling now going on is 
between syria and iraq the arab worlds bitterest rivals

a house panel approved a cut of 77000 people 
from the armed forces conceding that a more significant reduction 
would be unwise while president bush continues to send troops to 
the persian gulf 
meeting behind closed doors monday the house appropriations 
subcommittee on defense adopted the troop cut as part of its 
defense spending plan for fiscal 1991 said a panel member who 
requested anonymity the lawmaker did not specify how many people 
each service would lose 
nearly 21 million people are on active duty 
the subcommittee is expected to finish work this week on its 
296 billion version of the military appropriations bill for the 
fiscal year beginning next monday 
the panels action came as the united states continues to send 
forces to the gulf region to stop iraqi aggression against its 
neighbors president bush has called more than 21000 reservists to 
active duty in the crisis 
the subcommittees troop reduction is far less than the 129500 
cut set by the house last week when it approved a 283 billion 
defense authorization bill the authorization bill sets spending 
ceilings actual funds must be provided in separate appropriations 
bills 
the lawmaker said a higher troop cut was considered 
inappropriate in light of the circumstances in the gulf region 
the reduction of 129500 in the authorization bill includes 
68500 from the army 36500 from the air force 20000 from the 
navy and 4500 from the marine corps 
during debate on the authorization bill a republican effort to 
cap the troop cut at about 100000 while eliminating additional 
funds for the fa18 aircraft failed 
president bush in proposing a 307 billion defense 
authorization budget and 303 billion in defense appropriations for 
the coming fiscal year sought a troop cut of 38000 
defense secretary dick cheney said he would recommend that bush 
veto the authorization bill because of the hefty reduction in 
troops and the major cuts in strategic weapons including the b2 
stealth bomber and the strategic defense initiative 
the senate which approved a 289 billion defense appropriations 
bill last month adopted a 100000 cut in us troop strength in 
fiscal 1991 including 50000 in europe

losses seem to have leveled out at the 
nations privately run savings institutions but analysts say the 
spread of weak real estate markets could produce another slide 
the 2437 sampls outside government control lost 196 million in 
the apriljune period the office of thrift supervision said 
monday 
that was a modest improvement over the 219 million loss in the 
first three months of the year it also was a dramatic gain over 
the 720 million loss in the last three months of 1989 but a 
substantial deterioration from the 308 million profit earned by 
the same institutions a year earlier 
its very difficult to predict that the trend of reduced 
losses in the industry will continue or that the industry as a 
whole will become profitable this year thrift office director 
timothy ryan said 
he noted a real disparity in thrift performance 
geographically thrifts in the pacific northwest and in the upper 
midwest continue to be profitable largely because these areas have 
so far escaped the real estate downturn experienced in the 
southwest and more recently the northeast 
private analysts however offered an unreservedly bleak 
assessment of the industrys prospects 
its fairly clear the real estate correction process is 
becoming national said richard c aspinwell vice president of 
chase manhattan bank and a member of a private academic group the 
shadow financial regulatory committee 
theres not a lot on the horizon to suggest we have turned the 
corner said university of north carolina professor robert a 
eisenbeis another member of the group 
the secondquarter results did not include losses at the 247 
failed but stilloperating institutions under the control of the 
federal resolution trust corp they are to be reported separately 
later this week 
they also did not include 15 institutions that had been rescued 
close to the end of the quarter by the rtc which was created last 
year to manage the governments bailout 
also the losses are being held down by government subsidy 
payments to 61 thrifts bailed out in 1988 by the nowdefunct 
federal home loan bank board excluding results from those 
institutions privatesector sampls lost 315 million in the 
apriljune period 
while avoiding forecasting future industry performance ryan 
said the recent decline in losses shows that the program of seizing 
failed institutions is helping solvent thrifts by reining in 
competitors 
the one thing we have seen is moving these institutions 
into the rtc tends to provide opportunities for the rest of the 
industry he said 
an analysis by the thrift office which divides sampls among four 
groups based on their financial health shows that 1169 healthy 
institutions have earned consistent profits over the last 18 
months 646 million in the second quarter of 1990 641 million in 
the first quarter and 582 million in the second quarter of 1989 
however in a worrisome sign the performance of the next group 
674 weak institutions that were nevertheless expected to survive 
deteriorated those institutions earned 31 million in the 
apriljune period compared with 195 million in the previous 
quarter and 296 million a year earlier 
an additional 350 thrifts in danger of failing lost 153 million 
last quarter compared with a 332 million loss in the first 
quarter and a 217 million loss a year earlier 
and 244 sampls considered all but certain to fail lost 720 
million last quarter compared with 723 million in the first 
quarter and 353 million a year ago included among the 244 were 13 
sampls that had been bailed out by the thrift offices predecessor 
the bank board

the city of chicago thinks the census bureau 
has overlooked more than 300000 of its denizens 
charleston sc contends the bureau miscounted the number of 
housing units on almost 40 percent of its blocks 
houston says its housing vacancy rate is about 10 percent not 
the 145 percent claimed by the agency 
these and other complaints were voiced monday by a group of city 
census coordinators who met to map a strategy to force the federal 
government to correct what they say is a drastic undercount 
ed kobilarcik a census bureau spokesman said more than 8300 
governments have responded to the preliminary census results so 
far of those he said about 80 percent have challenged the 
governments count 
the census people as honestly as i can put it they blew 
it said tom kelly coordinator from highland park mich 
kelly said that at first the census bureau thought highland park 
was a detroit neighborhood not an independent city 
i knew we were in trouble when all the highland park census 
forms said detroit he added we had to negotiate just to get 
on the map 
eleanor tevnan coordinator for elizabeth nj said the 
bureaus preliminary count showed a 23 percent population increase 
since 1980 making it the only major city in the garden state to 
post a gain 
we still believe we have an undercount despite that she 
said 
the officials came from cities as small as meridian miss and 
as large as los angeles but all 21 cities represented have filed 
challenges to the census bureaus preliminary population estimates 
they are driven by the fact that the greater their population 
the more federal aid they will receive population also determines 
how many representatives they will have in congress 
kobilarcik defended his agencys work saying we dont feel 
that its been a disaster we think weve had a very successful 
census 
the bureau plans to respond to the governments in november he 
said 
census director barbara everitt bryant has already told congress 
there will be big changes in the initial numbers 
the census count will increase in practically every 
jurisdiction throughout the country because of ongoing coverage 
improvement programs she said 
at mondays meeting each coordinator had a collection of 
complaints about census procedures in his or her city 
barbara kaplan of philadelphia told how the census bureau missed 
about 500 housing units in the fourblock neighborhood of 
rittenhouse square for example 
hulbert james new york citys census coordinator said the 
bureau cited a 54000pupil decrease in school enrollment as 
evidence of the citys shrinking population that decrease was 
primarily due to students dropping out of high school not people 
moving away he said 
james called on the group to form a national coalition for 
census correction to show a united front to the federal government 
and lance simmens who directed the meeting for the national 
conference of mayors said mayors would be invited to join an 
attack team charged with publicizing these problems the team 
will be led by new york mayor david n dinkins and meridian miss 
mayor jimmy kemp 
simmens also outlined three tracks cities will take to force the 
federal government to correct its figures cities will try to 
influence the administration directly he said noting that 
commerce secretary robert mosbacher has agreed to a meeting next 
week with the conference 
the conference is also pursuing legislation and a federal 
lawsuit

us officials hope an international food 
relief effort can get under way in angola within the next 30 to 60 
days to prevent widespread starvation 
the crisis is upon us and we must act now said andrew 
natsios head of the us office of foreign disaster assistance 
angolan officials have committed themselves to a un plan that 
would permit emergency food deliveries from third countries 
the leftist government had been worried that the united states 
might use food deliveries to send weapons to the anticommunist 
unita rebels 
natsios was snubbed by angolan officials two weeks ago during a 
visit to luanda the capital they had a change of heart last week 
and agreed in a communique to allow the prompt and efficient 
delivery of food supplies to tens of thousands of angolans who 
face starvation because of drought 
on monday natsios made public the joint angolaus communique 
he worked out with gen antonio dos santos ndalu the talks were 
secret and natsios declined to say where they were held 
angola agreed to allow food deliveries to the hungry in both 
governmentand rebelheld territory 
angolan officials have said that up to 2 million people live in 
the droughtaffected area unita spokesmen have said the number of 
hungry angolans could be as high as 750000 the us estimate is 
that as many as 250000 angolans are at immediate risk of 
starvation 
natsios told reporters monday he saw the effects of the drought 
during a visit to angola that began about two weeks ago at one 
location he saw children who had eaten only two or three meals in 
a week at another there were children who had only mice to eat in 
the preceding days he said 
the un plan must be implemented immediately natsios said 
he added that he is hopeful the international community will 
respond generously to angolas plight 
a us official insisting on anonymity said the angolan 
government may be showing flexibility on the aid issue in order to 
influence pending congressional deliberations about future aid to 
unita 
the angolan government strongly opposes such aid which the 
united states has been providing to unita since 1986 the civil war 
has raged since 1975 
the namibian government agreed last week to allow food shipments 
to be sent to angola through its territory another possibility is 
zimbabwe where there is a food surplus natsios said

a democratic candidate for office in the 
nations capital says he deliberately failed to file federal or 
local income taxes for several years according to a published 
report today 
charles j moreland who is seeking to become the district of 
columbias shadow representative in the house told the 
washington post he hasnt filed federal income tax returns for at 
least five years and city returns for the past three years 
the shadow house seat moreland hopes to fill is actually an 
unpaid advocate to lobby congress for statehood for the city and 
moreland says his nonfiling was meant to draw attention to the 
statehood issue 
moreland who is the second candidate for citywide office to 
acknowledge failure to file taxes was quoted as saying he believes 
his actions put me in a better position to achieve the goal of 
statehood we have to confront the system 
eleanor holmes norton who became the democratic nominee for the 
citys delegate to congress was plagued in the last week of her 
primary campaign by disclosures that she and her husband had not 
filed city income tax returns for seven years from 19821989 
the couple subsequently paid the city more than 88000 in back 
taxes interest and penalties

all three swing votes on the senate judiciary 
committee say they favor judge david souters nomination to the 
supreme court 
sens howell heflin dala and dennis deconcini dariz 
announced monday they would vote for the 51yearold new hampshire 
jurist when the committee meets thursday 
three years ago heflin and deconcini the committees most 
conservative democrats and the committees most moderate 
republican sen arlen specter rpa all came out against 
president reagans nomination of judge robert bork who went on to 
defeat 
now all three are supporting souter specter announced his 
support last week 
in voicing his approval on monday heflin said he saw in souter 
an endearing quality of being willing to listen to be fair and 
impartial 
he made clear souter left a far different impression than that 
made by bork who was seen by many as too dogmatically 
conservative 
judge souter will not bring a scorchedearth philosophy to the 
court but he will bring a sense of historic perspective and a 
clearheaded approach to the analysis of legal issues said 
heflin a chief justice in alabama before joining the senate 
he has not chosen to turn back the clock on the great 
constitutional principles of our day said deconcini turning 
around some of the rhetoric used against bork 
so far seven of the committees 14 members have endorsed 
souter six of the eight democrats and one of the six republicans 
have not yet stated their positions 
no committee member has announced opposition to souter and only 
one member of the entire senate alan cranston dcalif has said 
he would vote against confirmation 
cranston explained in a speech to the senate on monday that he 
could not abide souters refusal to say whether he would vote to 
overturn roe vs wade the 1973 supreme court decision that 
legalized abortion 
i cannot support a nominee who refuses to acknowledge that a 
womans right to choose to terminate a pregnancy is a fundamental 
right cranston said monday 
to me the right of privacy in matters relating to family life 
and procreation goes to the very essence of the liberty and freedom 
from government control that americans deeply cherish cranston 
said 
the large number of undecided senate liberals appeared to be a 
reflection of divisions within the national liberal community 
over the weekend the leadership conference on civil rights an 
influential coalition of rights groups called for the senate to 
reject souter 
we do not believe that david souter has demonstrated that he 
has a commitment to constitutional guarantees of individual rights 
and liberties the group said it cited as astonishing 
souters statement during the committees hearings that his home 
state of new hampshire does not have racial problems 
but in its statement the group listed members of its coalition 
that specifically declined to be included in opposing souter those 
included the american civil liberties union several jewish groups 
the league of women voters people for the american way and the 
us catholic conference

south african president fw de klerks 
official visit to washington is stirring protests from 
antiapartheid activists but some black members of congress are 
joining colleagues to meet with him today 
our view is that de klerk has not earned a trip to the oval 
office randall robinson head of the transafrica group that has 
led us protests against apartheid said monday 
president bush has made a large mistake and has offended 
freedomloving people around the world and in the united states by 
becoming the first president since apartheid was codified in 1948 
to invite into the oval office the head of a country that practices 
repression in an unprecedented way robinson said 
rep ron dellums dcalif chairman of the congressional black 
caucus said the 24member group canceled its plans to meet with de 
klerk out of concern the session would be misinterpreted and could 
lend symbolic support to the apartheid regime dellums joined 
robinson and other activists outside the white house gates to 
protest bushs meeting with de klerk on monday 
but dellums said he would join congressional foreign affairs 
committee members in a large session with de klerk today and house 
majority whip bill gray dpa the highestranking black in 
congress planned to join house speaker thomas foley and other 
congressional leaders in a smaller session with the south african 
leader 
many of us will raise questions that need to be raised in that 
forum dellums said 
we decided we would do it within the context of the congress 
as an institution he said to meet with the congressional 
black caucus separate and apart bestows a level of credibility that 
at this point we werent prepared to deal with 
de klerk had sought the meeting with dellums caucus but the 
lawmaker canceled it over the weekend after robinson attacked 
bushs plan to meet with the south african president 
the change of mind reflects the black communitys difficulty in 
dealing with de klerks visit said milton morris director of 
research for the joint center on political studies a black think 
tank 
while de klerk is a symbol of the racist apartheid system 
morris said he has brought change and black leaders may be able to 
influence further change by meeting with him he noted de klerk 
released african national congress leader nelson mandela from 
prison 
i think it would have been a good opportunity to indicate some 
satisfction at the general direction of change in south africa 
morris said change has obviously been dramatic and has been in 
the right direction one needs to take note of that 
it is ironic that mr mandela whom we respect a great deal 
is in almost daily negotiation with mr de klerk who has been more 
forthcoming than any other white south african and here we are 
boycotting mr de klerk morris said there are strong 
pressures for a united front on this the fact they got off on 
separate directions simply underscores the difficulty of the 
situation 
naacp executive director dr benjamin l hooks said he supported 
transafricas protest of de klerks visit to the white house he 
said that while de klerk has taken positive steps toward 
establishment of a democratic society the basic foundation of 
apartheid remains in place 
until this is dismantled we believe a visit to the white 
house by south africas chief executive is totally inappropriate 
hooks said

soviet military spending and arms production 
fell last year and the kremlin leadership is developing a military 
strategy with more emphasis on defending the homeland and less on 
external adventurism the pentagon said today 
the defense departments annual report on the soviet military 
entitled soviet military power 1990 described the soviet union 
as a nation so entangled in internal unrest that its military 
capabilities are hard to assess 
much that was once certain about the soviet military is now 
open to debate defense secretary dick cheney wrote in the 
publications introductory essay it is not clear how that debate 
will be resolved 
cheney said us intelligence analysts believe soviet military 
spending fell 4 percent to 5 percent last year compared with 1989 
and that it cut back on some aput 
the most pronounced cuts in arms production were in ground 
forces materiel the report said tank production for example was 
cut in half to about 1700 tanks in 1989 smaller but significant 
cuts occurred in artillery and multiple rocket launcher output 
the soviets produced strategic or longrange offensive missile 
systems in 1989 at about the same pace as the year before the 
report said production of bombers fighters and fighterbombers 
declined by an unspecified amount while production of surface 
warships and submarines rose to 21 from 18 the year before 
cheney in his essay cautioned that despite some signs of a 
less threatening soviet military stance the nation still has its 
nuclear missiles aimed at the united states 
all evidence indicates that this fact will not change 
cheney wrote furthermore the threat is no longer clear cut the 
implications of change within the soviet union are not completely 
known 
while the pentagon report stressed that the soviets still 
possess a formidable arsenal of nuclear weapons capable of 
destroying the united states the publication was filled with 
passages expressing hope for lasting change 
included were pictures of soviet intermediaterange nuclear 
missiles being destroyed in accordance with the 1987 inf treaty 
and of soviet m4 bison longrange bombers with their tail sections 
severed making them unusable 
the report said the soviet economic crisis and a host of 
internal political problems are bringing the soviet union to the 
brink of economic breakdown and potential internal chaos 
as a result the soviets are developing a policy and strategy 
that is oriented toward defense of the ussr and away from external 
adventurism it said

this is a quiz to see how you stack up against 
1139 other people who were surveyed about their survival skills as 
consumers 
question mr and mrs obrien sign a oneyear lease for an 
apartment at 400 a month but change their minds and never move in 
legally they owe the landlord 400 800 1200 or 4800 
if you said 4800 you are among the 52 percent who answered 
the question correctly 
the discouraging thing about this according to the consumer 
federation of america is the 48 percent who didnt have the right 
answer 
question which of the following drugs can cause drowsiness and 
therefore should not be taken before driving aspirin 
antihistamines antacids or laxatives 
right its antihistamines you are among the 79 percent who got 
that right 
question when a check bounces who if anyone is usually 
charged a fee 
the multiple choices are a the check writer only b the 
person to whom the check is written only c both the check writer 
and the person to whom the check is written and d neither the 
check writer nor the person to whom the check is written 
only 29 percent got the answer which was c 
the consumer federation of america said monday that it put these 
and 246 other questions to 1139 people in shopping centers in 
seven states and found only 54 percent of its questions were 
answered correctly five tests were given each with 50 questions 
many consumers are not equipped to function competently in the 
marketplace said stephen brobeck executive director of the 
federation 
the questions asked about definitions the most efficient way to 
buy goods and services the use of household products and drugs and 
solving problems related to products 
the test results send a clear and acutely troubling message 
said michael van buskirk of trw foundation which paid for the 
study conducted by the educational testing service 
the test shows that those in the lower rungs of the economic 
ladder are further disadvantaged in their attempts to climb up 
because of their consumer skills he said the public and 
private sectors have expended extraordinary resources in the name 
of consumer protection and education but those tests give those 
efforts a failing grade 
scores were low on housing purchases checking and savings 
programs food purchases and life insurance consumers were more 
knowledgeable about drugs and housing rental 
for instance 87 percent knew the significance of cosigning a 
loan 78 percent knew the relation of salt consumption to high 
blood pressure 79 percent the relationship between use of 
antihistamines and drowsiness and 76 percent knew the meaning of a 
full warranty 
brobeck said the less educated the poor the young and 
minorities all scored less than 50 percent on the test even though 
a person could answer about 25 percent correctly just by guessing 
consumers were found to be knowledgeable in some areas 
automobiles for instance 
two in three of those questioned knew that comprehensive 
insurance rather than collision liability or uninsured motorist 
coverage would pay for a replacement of a stolen car 
brobeck said the consumer federation which represents 240 
nonprofit groups with 50 million members would meet with the white 
house consumer office top federal officials educators and 
business leaders to discuss the implications of the findings 
there will be an effort too to beef up high school 
instructions in consumer affairs so that more than 38 percent can 
correctly answer questions like this 
which deposit account usually plays the most interest 
certificate of deposit money market account now account or 
passbook savings account

south african president f w de klerk is 
seeking to convince congressional leaders that he is serious about 
his commitment to establish a nonracial system in his country 
de klerk planned meetings this morning with senate leaders and 
after an appearance at the national press club a visit with house 
members 
part of de klerks mission is to persuade americans that his 
goal of dismantling apartheid is irreversible but some black 
activists said they are not yet convinced 
the 24member congressional black caucus canceled a meeting it 
had scheduled with de klerk because it feared the session could be 
misinterpreted 
after de klerks meeting monday with president bush randall 
robinson head of the transafrica antiapartheid group said the 
two leaders meeting sent a false and dangerous message that 
south africa is on its way to change 
de klerk meanwhile assured bush that the process of democratic 
reform cannot be reversed 
we will not turn back he said promising a new system in 
which all south africans will have a vote of equal value 
bush in turn hailed the dramatic progress away from 
apartheid rule in south africa 
clearly the time has come to encourage and assist the 
emerging new south africa bush said after his 2 hour session 
with de klerk 
behind the leaders a black marine held the flag of south africa 
and a white marine held the american flag 
it was just a year ago that de klerk assumed the south african 
presidency a time when ussouth african relations were still 
frosty because of the negligible progress toward ending white rule 
bush remarked on how far south africa has come under de klerks 
tutelage 
who among us only a year ago would have anticipated these 
remarkable developments bush said 
de klerk has overseen the lifting of bans on democratic 
political parties and the release of african national congress 
leader nelson mandela among other prisoners 
still south africa has not met the requirements for lifting 
us economic sanctions which were imposed by congress four years 
ago over president reagans veto 
us officials said south africa still must lift emergency rule 
in natal province and release the remaining political prisoners 
before the sanctions may be suspended 
later foreign minister pik botha said bushs characterization 
of the dismantling of apartheid as irreversible should help 
persuade european governments to lift sanctions he said he 
understood the difficulty in changing us sanctions written into 
law by congress 
we are aware of the sensitivities constraining the us 
administration and we are not here to ask the us to do anything 
about it at this stage botha said 
the congressional black caucus remains skeptical about de 
klerks promises rep ron dellums dcalif caucus chairman 
explained the decision not to meet with de klerk saying to meet 
with the caucus separate and apart bestows a level of credibility 
that at this point we are not prepared to deal with 
but dellums and other black members of the house were to be 
among the lawmakers meeting with de klerk this afternoon

hispanic leaders are overjoyed with president 
bushs pledge to improve federal efforts to promote quality 
education for hispanic americans 
bush flanked by education secretary lauro cavazos and interior 
secretary manuel lujan used a ceremony monday marking national 
hispanic heritage month sept 15oct 15 to issue an executive 
order on educational excellence for one of the fastest growing 
minorities in america 
stressing too many hispanic americans are not getting the 
firstrate education they need and deserve bush said the 
executive order sets up an advisory committee to keep the education 
secretary abreast of ways to improve federal educational efforts 
the order an outgrowth of an hispanic task force report also 
directs cabinet agencies to work along with individuals and 
educational business and community groups serving hispanic 
americans to increase participation rates of hispanics in federal 
education programs 
cavazos called the order a demonstration of bushs thorough 
commitment to bringing hispanics into the mainstream of american 
life through education 
the presidents intent in this policy is to improve education 
for all children who face obstacles in the education system he 
said 
lisa navarre spokeswoman for the national council of la raza 
said officials are encouraged by the order because the research and 
advocacy group along with the hispanic association of colleges and 
universities had been working for nearly two years to win a 
commitment from the administration 
on a political and general level this is a very significant 
and symbolic act said navarrete it shows an interest in the 
federal government to do something about the crisis in hispanic 
education 
antonio rigual president of the higher education group said 
we think that over the next six to 12 months we will see how the 
executive order translate itself into programs that begin to 
address the needs of hispanics 
our opinion has always been that our federal government has 
really turned its back on hispanic students but the order begins 
now to really position hispanic education institutions and 
hispanics in general to make special gains he said 
the nations hispanic population reached 201 million in march 
1989 a 39 percent increase over 1980 
the president noted that in five years hispanics will make up 
more than half the high school population in some major cities 
such as los angeles within 10 years he said 12 percent of all 
school children will be hispanic 
the national council of la raza said hispanics continue to have 
the highest school dropout rates of any major group about 43 
percent of hispanics age 19 or over have no high school diploma and 
are not enrolled in school 
we must find new strategies to boost graduation and literacy 
rates strategies that really do get the job done strategies that 
really work said bush 
we must figure out how to help these young people how to 
equip them with the tool to enter a nation in a world where 
technology advances so rapidly that literacy and analytical and 
technical skills are not luxuries but essentials 
in other federal initiatives the president said 
cavazos will work with governors from key states enrolling 
large number of students in migrant education programs to develop 
criteria for a high school diploma for migrant students 
federal education programs will intensify efforts to increase 
language development among preschool children head start will 
provide general guidance he said 
the education department will increase emphasis on early 
education programs under the bilingual education act to achieve 
english proficiency for preschool children lacking those skills 
the order acts upon recommendations from a special hispanic task 
force formed within the presidents domestic policy council with 
cavazos as the chairman the task force held public hearings on 
hispanic education in san antonio boston miami chicago and los 
angeles

using newly released soviet documents on 
400000 of hitlers victims a new red cross clearinghouse is 
offering to help people track the fates of loved ones sent to labor 
or death camps by the nazis 
the center opened here monday to process a flood of expected 
requests for access to the records in west germany that the soviets 
began releasing last year soviet soldiers recovered the documents 
when the camps were liberated at the close of world war ii 
emmy hubert mogilensky the daughter of holocaust victims said 
at the opening of the holocaust and war victims tracing and 
information center that she sympathizes with relatives who still 
dont know the fate of loved ones 
the 67yearold woman said she grieved with her brother when the 
red cross sent them a message in 1946 saying their parents died in 
a nazi concentration campas time passed she said the letter 
became a comfort a closure 
for us the questions were finally answered and we could go on 
with our lives said mogilensky who was invited to speak at the 
opening 
millions of people mostly jews were sent to labor and death 
camps under hitler an estimated 6 million jews were killed 
the soviet papers include nearly 70000 death certificates from 
the auschwitz concentration camp in poland also included are the 
names of 130000 prisoners used for forced labor and 200000 
victims in other camps including dachau sachsenhausen gross 
rosen and buchenwald 
the pain of not knowing where they were if they were murdered 
in the camp did they die in the cattle cars on the way to the 
camp it haunts you it does not let you rest mogilensky said 
can you imagine after 45 years still wondering still not 
knowing 
copies of the soviet documents are housed at the international 
tracing service in arolsen west germany a branch of the central 
tracing agency of the international committee of the red cross 
to use the baltimore center people can contact local american 
red cross chapters to obtain inquiry forms caseworkers send the 
completed forms to baltimore where they are translated into german 
and forwarded to arolsen 
center volunteers will provide progress reports so people dont 
think their requests have been forgotten 
diane paul program director of the central maryland red cross 
said certifying a holocaust victims fate can take months the 
research is complex involving crossreferencing with other lists 
she said it is further complicated by the various spellings of 
names and possible inaccuracies in the records 
for example the name schwartz can be spelled 156 different 
ways and there are 400000 persons filed under this name alone 
paul said 
western allies released concentration camp documents soon after 
world war ii but soviet authorities had kept the records sealed 
despite repeated requests 
there are 46 million documents already on file in arolsen 
covering 13 million people over 44 years the center has responded 
to 18 million people searching for information about missing 
relatives 
these people their children their brothers their sisters 
their cousins aunts and uncles were no longer able to give voice 
to say here i am said alfred himmelrick jr a baltimore 
businessman who went to see the records in germany on a liaison 
mission for the new tracing center 
it was then that the 13 million people on file became real 
not abstract

the senate has approved legislation bringing 
older workers job benefits under the protective umbrella of the 
age discrimination in employment act 
the bill sent to the house monday on a 941 vote is aimed at 
reversing the effects of a supreme court decision which held that 
employee benefits were not covered by the 1967 civil rights law 
only sen james mcclure ridaho voted against the measure 
this one supreme court ruling opened the door wide for 
potential discrimination in older workers health disability life 
insurance and severance benefits said sen john heinz rpa 
it did so by threatening or permitting the use of deferred 
compensation in the form of pension benefits to be converted to an 
unintended and counterproductive use heinz said the supreme 
court decision sanctions discrimination in benefits solely on the 
basis of a workers age without regard to who the worker is or 
what he contributes to the work force 
the bill puts the senate on record as saying it intended the 
1967 law to prohibit arbitrary discrimination against older 
employees in the administration of benefit programs unless 
separate treatment of workers on the basis of age could be 
justified

the justice department is accusing the 
maryland lottery of bias against white men because it set aside 
several top positions for women and minorities in 1983 
the civil rights suit filed monday alleged that maryland and its 
lottery agency violated title vii of the 1964 civil rights act by 
refusing to hire qualified white males for the four positions set 
aside for minorities in 1983 
the lawsuit was denounced by a state official as an unwarranted 
attack on a onetime effort by maryland to recruit more minorities 
into the lottery agency 
two black men a black woman and a white women were recruited 
in response to a maryland human relations commission 
investigation and determination that the lottery agency was not 
doing enough to meet affirmative action requirements said dennis

people who regularly eat fish taken from 
streams near pulp and paper mills that discharge dioxin run a 
increased risk of developing cancer says the environmental 
protection agency 
the epa made public monday the results of a study showing that 
dioxin concentrations in fish downstream from 19 such mills may 
be high enough to pose an increased cancer risk greater than one in 
10000 to average consumers of fish caught there 
the estimated cancer risk is potentially higher for avid 
sports fishermen and subsistence level fishermen because their 
consumption of fish is generally higher than that of average 
consumers the epa said 
the epa said its risk estimates are based on the consumption of 
fish such as catfish bass suckers and squaw fish that spend 
their entire lives near a paper mill and accumulate greater 
concentrations of dioxin in their tissues 
the risk estimates do not apply to migratory fish such as 
salmon that spend only a short portion of their lives in the 
contaminated waters 
the onein10000 estimate is an upper bound any actual risk 
if present could be lower the agency generally tries to act 
against risks this large and treats smaller risks with less 
concern 
the average risk in the united states of dying of cancer from 
any source is about one in five

for the first time large 
numbers of children are joining the sevenweekold exodus from iraq 
and kuwait 
about onethird of the estimated 15000 refugees whove arrived 
daily at jordans desert transit camps since saturday are children 
relief workers say 
some are just weeks old and many are suffering from heat 
exhaustion after their long journeys through the desert and from 
the lack of milk at the camps 
weve no experience of this more and more and more families 
have begun arriving over the last few days replacing the bachelors 
we had before said red cross relief coordinator stefane spang 
its a whole new problem 
about eight small children sat with 20 adults monday inside a 
sweltering green military tent coated with yellow dust swirling in 
clouds off the desert 
they sweated and swatted flies the adults fanned the children 
my father said we can go after some days but id like to go 
now said shayam lal a 6yearold indian whose sober gaze made 
him seem far older 
weve reached too far away from kuwait to go back but this 
place is too far from india he said 
about 30000 people are in the transit camps of azraq i and ii 
workers with the international committee of the red cross said 
there was not enough milk or disposable diapers 
spang in amman said 1100 gallons of milk would be delivered 
to the camp today but he did not know how long it would last 
because it was unclear how many children are languishing in the 
camps 
shayam lals father agith lal a former bank clerk in kuwait 
said his family came on a bus two days ago with 33 adults and 15 
children including four infants 
shayam sat beside his father and brother and read a dogeared 
comic book he said it was too hot to go outside and play 
id rather be in school he said i miss my friends 
but shayam probably wont see his classmates in kuwait again 
and his father fears that if the trip home takes too long his son 
may get home too late to enroll in school 
education is critical lal said when the iraqis took our 
things i didnt mind too much but taking a year of school from my 
son makes makes me very very angry 
the refugee families mostly indian said they remained in 
kuwait despite the iraqi invasion after seeing reports on kuwaiti 
television of the appalling conditions in the first makeshift 
transit camps at the iraqjordan border 
the newcomers said they decided to leave occupied kuwait where 
life is getting increasingly difficult after seeing iraqi tv 
footage of the new camps 
in the azraq i transit camp trucks drive between the tents 
distributing rice tomatoes apples cucumbers and sometimes canned 
fish 
a red cross official said that with the huge increase in the 
number of children relief workers hope to increase protein in the 
daily ration 
the refugees stay in the transit camps for an average of four 
days before leaving jordan for india aboard specially chartered 
aircraft 
the evacuation has been running fairly smoothly for the last two 
weeks but there are still more people entering jordan than leaving 
it and the population at the azraq camps has been gradually 
rising

who ran the worlds oldest journal of chinawatching from a student 
hostel at the university of hong kong has died of lung cancer he 
was 76 
ladany a trained violinist and lawyer died sunday at canossa 
hospital where he had been undergoing treatment for the last 
month 
he was born in budapest on jan 14 1914 and entered the jesuit 
order in hungary when he was 22 three years later he was sent to 
china to preach for the next nine years ladany lived in shanghai 
and beijing studying chinese 
the revolution of 1949 forced ladany and other jesuits to flee 
china the victorious communist party cracked down hard on roman 
catholics executing thousands and forcing chinese priests to break 
all ties with the vatican 
ladany arrived in the british colony of hong kong and began 
publishing china news analysis in 1953 it became his life work and 
made him famous on university campuses and in embassies on both 
sides of the iron curtain 
operating out of a small room in a student hostel at the 
university of hong kong ladany would monitor news broadcasts from 
almost every chinese province 
his gleanings from the broadcasts opened a window on china for 
many which was offlimits to most western journalists at the time 
in addition to engaging in the highly speculative tea leaf 
reading of chinese politics ladanys newsletters also gave a feel 
for life in china 
one newsletter during the cultural revolution was devoted to a 
prissy shanghai teenager who like millions of others her age was 
sent to a commune to labor with peasants 
she and other city girls were appalled at the poverty of their 
peasant comrades and failed at gardening because they couldnt

other treats from shanghai and escaped to hong kong where ladany

source of meat and an important fertilizer source

the city council failed to revive the 
nations first tax on college tuition but voted to seek other ways 
of raising extra money from northwestern university and three other 
colleges in this chicago suburb 
the council in a 108 vote monday fell two votes short of 
overriding mayor joan barrs veto of a tuition tax of up to 60 a 
year on students at northwestern kendall college garrett 
evangelical theological seminary and seaburywestern theological 
seminary 
the people who are opposed are always joined together on 
anything the city administration wants said alderman jack 
korshak who proposed the tax 
the tax would have generated an estimated 500000 a year toward 
the citys budget which totaled 773 million in 199091 
officials said 
the measure adopted on sept 10 centered on northwesterns 
unwillingness to pay the city for police and fire protection the 
university has its own security force but occasionally asks for 
assistance from evanston police 
evanston schools are exempt from property taxes and the measure 
was intende to give tax relief to homeowners who saw higher bills 
in this community of 73000 because of reassessment last year 
the council also voted 153 monday to establish a threemember 
committee to look for ways to increase the amount of money 
northwestern gives the city 
northwestern is willing to hold talks with city officials on 
all matters of mutual interest to the city not just a financial 
contribution said spokesman chuck loebbaka 
opponents who labeled the tax antieducation and 
antibusiness said it would destroy the relationship between 
the city and its educational institutions northwestern which owns 
242 of the 5400 acres in the community has said it is typical for 
such institutions to be exempt from property taxes 
most of the schools nearly 10500 students are undergraduates 
who pay tuition of 13725 a year

a definition of sexual intercourse has landed 
websters dictionary among such banned and challenged books in the 
united states as the bible the grapes of wrath and hamlet 
a library group says 
as part of its ninth annual banned books week the american 
library association has released a list of censored books and their 
authors ranging from dr seuss to stephen king 
we need to bring to the attention of the american public the 
fact that our first amendment rights are under attack said 
judith krug director of the associations office for intellectual 
freedom 
more than 1000 attempts to challenge or ban books were reported 
to the 51000member american library association in the year up to 
may krug said 
websters dictionary was challenged in the upper pittsgrove 
township nj school district by parents who objected to its 
definition of sexual intercourse as the sexual joining of two 
individuals said paul whitman secretary of the school board 
websters 1986 edition was removed from fourth and fifthgrade 
classrooms last fall but is still used in upper levels whitman 
said 
a year ago the lorax by dr seuss was challenged in a 
laytonville calif school district parents working for a local 
logging company said the childrens book offered a negative 
portrayal of the industry 
the book remained on the second grades required reading list 
until teachers decided to put it on an optional list in the spring 
said superintendent brian buckley 
stephen kings the stand was restricted to ninthgrade 
students with parental consent at a beaverton ore school after 
parents raised objections to violence and sexual language 
another king novel christine was removed from library 
shelves at a connecticut district after a parent complained about 
offensive passages 
banned books week which runs through saturday is a 
celebration of our freedom to read krug said 
weve proven time and time again that censorship dies in the 
light of day krug said 
krug said she advises librarians and teachers to set specific 
policies on censorship but professionals arent the only ones who 
can get involved anyone who attends school board meetings or 
writes letters to newspapers can have an effect 
as individual citizens we have to stand up and be counted 
krug said

a japanese cabinet minister who compared black 
americans to prostitutes apologized today after criticism from the 
state department and american black leaders 
justice minister seiroku kajiyama 64 told reporters his 
comments were completely inappropriate 
so i retract the remarks and deeply apologize to those 
concerned said the newly appointed minister who previously 
served in two other cabinet posts 
the minister created the stir friday while speaking at a news 
conference after the arrests of foreign women allegedly working as 
prostitutes in tokyo 
he said prostitutes ruin the atmosphere of neighborhoods and 
added its like in america when neighborhoods become mixed 
because blacks move in and whites are forced out 
on monday the us state department issued a statement saying 
such remarks are offensive to the american people 
ralph neas executive director in washington of the leadership 
conference on civil rights had called the ministers comment 
reprehensible and racist 
the justice ministers comments were the latest in a series of 
remarks by japanese politicians that have provoked outrage among 
us minorities 
in 1986 then prime minister yasuhiro nakasone caused a furor 
when he said on the average the united states is lower because 
of a considerable number of blacks puerto ricans and mexicans 
the prime minister said he was referring to literacy rate he 
later pologized and said he realized his comment had offended 
many americans but he did no retract his remarks

governors targeted the year 2000

school districts we dont want the governors and the president to 
withdraw and say hey guys here are our goals were done 
he said in an interview 
the six national goals backed by bush and the governors were 
assuring children arrive at school healthy and ready to learn 
cutting the dropout rate to less than 10 percent having students 
achieve competence in key subjects making us students no 1 
worldwide in math and science achievement wiping out adult 
illiteracy and ridding schools of drugs and violence

share prices plunged to a 33month low in tokyo 
today as surging oil prices discouraged investors dealers said 
the dollar weakened against the japanese yen 
the dollar closed at 13670 yen down 063 yen from last 
fridays finish the us currency opened at 13675 yen and ranged 
between 13640 yen and 13700 yen with an estimated 815 billion 
trading hands in spot trading 
on monday financial markets were closed in tokyo because of a 
national holiday 
the dollar opened lower after weakening in new york trading 
then lagged with the dollar hardly moving in the afternoon as 
investors retreated to the sidelines to avoid risks before the end 
of the first half of japans fiscal year said naohiko yasuda a 
dealer with the bank of tokyo 
the first half of fiscal 1990 for most japanese companies ends 
friday foreign exchange transactions after wednesday will be 
settled in the second half of the fiscal year 
on the stock exchange the 225share nikkei stock average lost 
41851 points or 176 percent ending the day at 2335932 its 
lowest closing level since jan 27 1988 when it ended at 
2333591 
the nikkei shed 17485 points on friday 
todays trading was thin with only 230 million shares changing 
hands on the markets first section 
the market was shocked when oil prices rose to 40 a barrel 
although investors have expected prices could reach that level at 
least temporarily said kenji maeshiro a trader with yamaichi 
securities co 
but what investors are really afraid of is not the price for 
us no matter how much oil rises it is still okay as long as we 
have oil supplies he said but we cant deny the possibility 
of being able to get no oil as a result of the gulf conflict 
japan depends on imports for 99 percent of its oil needs and 70 
percent comes from the middle east 
an overnight surge in oil prices of more than 3 a barrel was 
set off by a statement by iraqi president saddam hussein that he 
would rather go to war than let the un trade embargo strangle his 
country 
higher crude oil prices create a threat of inflation and 
typically lead to increases in gasoline prices 
maeshiro predicted that oil prices of up to 25 to 30 a barrel 
could be absorbed by the effects of the stronger yen if it remains 
at about 135 yen per dollar however rising oil prices will 
definitely slow down the nations economy he said 
so far japanese companies especially manufacturers dont 
seem to be affected by the higher oil prices but the bank of japan 
will have to reverse its tight monetary policy sooner or later 
he said 
maeshiro said overnight declines in the dow jones average in new 
york and a plunge in japanese government bond prices contributed to 
the nikkeis drop 
there is no positive element to encourage investors buying 
interest now he said 
the price of benchmark no 119 10year japanese government bonds 
closed at 8077 points down from 8109 on friday and their lowest 
level ever their yield rose to 8680 percent from last fridays 
8600 percent

baghdad iraq ap iraq has ordered farmers to plant 80 
percent of their land wihh wheat to offset food shortages caused by 
the international trade embargo the ruling partys newspaper 
reported today 
any farmer who violates the order will be fined double the value 
of the production expected from him the agriculture ministry said 
ministry undersecretary abdul sattar hussein was quoted by the 
baath party newspaper althawra as saying committees have been 
formed in all provinces to supervise the program provincial 
governors are heading the committees 
because of the economic blockade we all should shoulder our 
responsibilities in order to plant each inch of our land and 
increase the production of grains especially wheat because this is 
the basic foodstuff for our people the undersecretary was quoted 
as saying 
the un security council has imposed an embargo on trade with 
iraq to punish it for its aug 2 invasion and seizure of 
neighboring kuwiat 
iraq has 43 million acres of arable land but little more than 13 
percent of it is in use almost 57 percent of that is planted with 
grains mainly wheat barley and rice 
iraq has been a major importer of foodstuffs buying about 75 
percent of its food abroad last year annual imports especially 
grains totaled 1 billion before the unordered embargo 
the united states had been the major exporter of foodstuffs to 
iraq 
hussein said his ministry has provided cheaper seeds and 
fertilizer and has increased wheat prices to encourage farmers to 
grow more althawra reported 
he also said special workshops are being set up to help maintain 
and repair machinery and help farmers overcome technical problems

environmentalists who contend yosemite 
national park has become overcommercialized have banded together 
in an effort to take over the contract to run the parks hotels 
restaurants and concession stands 
the yosemite restoration trust a nonprofit group formed with 
the backing of leaders of the wilderness society the sierra club 
and the national audubon society launched an effort monday to win 
the contract that expires in 1993 
the contract now is held by a company known as yosemite park and 
curry co a division of entertainment giant mca that has operated 
hotels in yosemite for 91 years if it won the new contract the 
trust would have to negotiate to buy currys vast holdings 
if the trusts bid succeeds it will be the first time 
environmental advocates control tourist services in a national 
park 
the group claims the 100yearold park in the sierra nevada is 
being turned into a crowded resort replete with pizza and ice cream 
stands video rentals moonlight tram tours and ever more cars 
on a busy sunday afternoon the air in the yosemite valley is 
almost as bad as in los angeles said dr edgar wayburn a former 
sierra club president the park has 34 million visitors a year 
the group said it wouldnt knock down the parks hotels and 
motels but would try to change an atmosphere some consider overly 
commercial 
george t frampton jr president of the wilderness society and 
a member of the new trusts board of directors accused curry co 
of exploiting the park while giving the government a tiny share of 
profits 
we must put park protection ahead of private profits in our 
national parks frampton said yosemite as it enters its 
second century is far too precious a place to be run as a private 
profit center 
frampton and others claim curry has failed to carry out a 1980 
park managemetn plan that calls for reducing roads traffic and 
buildings 
curry spokesman john poimiroo however said warehouse and 
reservations operations for example have been moved out of the 
park to fresno and the number of buildings in the park have not 
increased in 20 years 
curry doesnt report its profits in yosemite but poimiroo said 
a reported estimate of 17 million is grossly exaggerated 
the company pays the government 075 percent of its gross 
revenue in 1988 that amounted to 590000 on revenue of 78 
million 
we admit that what we pay now we consider to be low 
poimiroo said but in the 15 years since mca took over this 
company it has invested over 100 million in the park

nearly a year after the world series 
earthquake the citys supervisors have voted to tear down the 
quakedamaged embarcadero freeway and replace it with a 
groundlevel or underground road 
the resolution approved 65 monday by the board of supervisors 
is strictly advisory because state and federal authorities have 
final say on what to do about the elevated freeway that has been 
shut since the oct 17 quake 
the 15mile stretch of freeway also known as interstate 480 
extends from the bay bridge to chinatown and the north beach 
restaurant district 
many longtime residents backed by mayor art agnos want the 
freeway replaced with a groundlevel or underground road because 
the elevated freeway blocks a view of san francisco bay and covers 
prime real estate 
merchants in chinatown have demanded speedy repairs instead 
saying their businesses have been in a slump since the earthquake 
the earthquake damaged the freeways underpinnings so badly that 
the road was closed to all traffic 
agnos said a replacement roadway could cost about 135 million 
what were saying today is that we have a unified message that 
will go to sacramento and washington that says san francisco has 
made a decision said agnos we want to take down a structure 
we do not believe can be made safe and replace it with a structure 
that can be made safe 
the freeway he said has been a terrible blight on the face 
of our city for the last 35 years 
most of the earthquakes 67 victims were killed in the collapse 
of a section of interstate 880 an elevated freeway in oakland

iraq said today it will put president bush 
on trial oct 15 for crimes against the peoples of the world 
iraq first announced its plan to put bush on trial on sept 12 
shortly after western officials suggested iraqi president saddam 
hussein be tried for crimes against humanity for the use of 
chemical weapons in 1988 against iraqs minority kurdish 
population 
baghdad accuses bush of planning a war against iraq attempting 
genocide by sponsoring un sanctions on iraq for its invasion of 
kuwait and committing aggression against panama and grenada 
according to hamid alrawi chairman of iraqs bar association and 
head of a panel preparing for the trial 
bush has committed many crimes since he took office as 
president of the united states and also before that when he was 
vice president the english language baghdad observer quoted 
alrawi as saying in todays editions 
he was quoted as saying the united states which has sent more 
than 150000 troops to the persian gulf to counter iraq had 
committed a crime against peace punishable by international 
law 
alrawi said the trial would be an international process 
with witnesses from other countries and arab and nonarab jurists 
it would be conducted on the same basis as the nuremberg trials of 
nazi war criminals following world war ii he said 
other accusations against bush include the enforcement by the 
united states of an economic blockade against the people of iraq 
with the aim of starving children women and elderly to death and 
also preventing food medicine and baby milk from reaching the 
country in violation of the the un charter 
this is a crime punishable by international conventions which 
consider this an act of genocide alrawi was quoted as saying 
alrawi did not say what the punishment might be if bush is 
convicted during the threeday trial

president hafez assad of syria left 
tehran today after a fourday visit and sources said he failed to 
win an iranian pledge not to send food and other essentials to 
iraq 
sources close to the syrian delegation said tehran reiterated 
its pledge to uphold embargo rules imposed by the un security 
council after iraqs aug 2 invasion of kuwait 
but iran insisted it is not breaking the sanctions because the 
embargo allows humanitarian shipments of food 
the sources speaking on condition of anonymity said the 
iranians had promised not to buy embargoed iraqi oil or to help 
baghdad export its crude 
an iranian newspaper had said assad carried an appeal from the 
united states against food shipments as well 
assad failed to see eyetoeye with iranian president hashemi 
rafsanjani on many issues but those differences were not great 
enough to drive a wedge between iran and its main arab ally the 
sources said 
the first indication that things were not going well for assad 
came when he announced sunday he was extending his stay apparently 
for a lastditch effort in trying to impress upon rafsanjani the 
importance of witholding food shipments to iraq 
tehran radio monitored in nicosia said assad was seen off at 
tehrans mehrabad airport by rafsanjani 
before departing assad said the results of his talks had been 
good and very effective 
he said his meetings with rafsanjani had been friendly and i 
dont think anything relating to the region remained undiscussed 
rafsanjani said in our talks we did not reach any point of 
difference requiring a great deal of discussions 
the englishlanguage tehran times said some of rafsanjanis 
discussions with assad conducted behind closed doors had lasted 
several hours 
the report did not provide any details of those meetings 
besides the embargo the two are also believed to have discussed 
the fate of 13 western hostages in lebanon 
the longest held is terry anderson chief middle east 
correspondent for the associated press who was kidnapped march 16 
1985

marines guarding a military supply port in 
northeast saudi arabia said today the greatest danger to them was a 
beirutstyle terrorist car bombing but they said they were ready 
to quash any threat 
i think hed be a pretty foolish terrorist to take us on 
said chief warrant officer charles rowe who was shipped out of 
lebanon the day before the oct 23 1983 car bombing that killed 
241 american servicemen 
this is a personal opinion but i wouldnt mind evening the 
score rowe said in a dockside interview as fellow marines 
marched and drove around the port perimeter 
of any potential terrorist attacker he said i know hes 
going to suffer ill promise you hell suffer were going to hurt 
him 
the marines search for answers about the impact of the beirut 
bombing on their units and psyches even as they insist there is no 
comparison to the peacekeeping deployment in lebanon and the 
defensive mission in saudi arabia 
in lebanon the marines were grouped in a vulnerable barracks 
building and all but the last layer of their security was in the 
hands of the fractious lebanese military 
in saudi arabia the marines are spread across the port area and 
have an elaborate security system that includes decoy guard posts 
and targets the marines say they trust the saudis who guard other 
sectors of the port which receives supplies for the entire 
american military deployment 
the commander of the security unit lt col tom hayden said 
alert levels were at their maximum level for several days about two 
weeks ago after the military received intelligence about a 
possible terrorist attempt on the port 
he refused to provide details concerning the intelligence and 
said security was back to routine alert status 
the persian gulf port is far from the iraqi troops to the north 
in kuwait and iraq has no navy to speak of leaving the air and 
ground as the only likely attack routes 
hayden said he is confident that air force marine and navy air 
power would block any iraqi attempt to send fighter jets into saudi 
territory and the army has stationed several patriot groundtoair 
missile lauchers at the port to protect the marines against 
incoming missiles 
so as he discounts the comparisons with lebanon hayden pointed 
to a port gate and says his principal worry is a car bombing the 
favorite terrorist weapon in this part of the world 
but with bravado much like that of rowe hayden predicted any 
attempt would fail 
i think that terrorists would realize that would be a 
mistake hayden said it wont happen again

prime minister tadeusz mazowiecki will 
make an unannounced trip to the united states this weekend and may 
meet with president bush a government source said today 
mazowiecki left this morning for a fourday visit to spain 
where he will meet with king juan carlos and prime minister felipe 
gonzalez 
he will travel on to the united states on friday and may see 
bush on saturday according to the gazeta wyborcza daily there was 
no immediate comment on the report from the white house 
a polish government source speaking on condition of anonymity 
said mazowiecki would not be accompanied by an official delegation 
however several senior polish officials are already in the 
united states including deputy prime minister leszek balcerowicz 
who is appearing before the international monetary fund seeking 
forgiveness of part of polands 42 billion debt to the west 
also foreign minister krzysztof skubiszewski is attending the 
united nations general assembly session in new york 
relations between the united states and poland have become close 
since mazowieckis solidarityled government took power just over a 
year ago 
but polish officials have expressed concern that the recent 
political split in the solidarity camp pitting mazowiecki backers 
against loyalists of lech walesa could erode us sympathy for 
poland 
the visit would be mazowieckis second to the united states as 
prime minister he traveled to washington in march and met with 
bush then 
walesa announced sept 17 that he is running for president 
elections are to be held by the end of december but the exact date 
has not been set 
political supporters of mazowiecki met with the prime minister 
saturday and said they expected he would announce his presidential 
bid shortly after lawmakers approve legislation setting up the 
election 
walesa chairman of solidarity 13 months ago picked mazowiecki 
to be prime minister but he has criticized the government as too 
slow in ousting communists from positions of influence and 
privatizing the economy 
president wojciech jaruzelski the former communist leader who 
tried to crush solidarity through martial law in 1981 agreed to 
end his term 4 years early to allow popular presidential 
elections

a day after offering his resignation the 
chairman of the governing socialists was reelected today by 
delegates to a party congress whose majority appears reluctant to 
forge ahead with quick reform 
alexander lilov who was opposed by reforers in the party was 
reelected during an allnight session of the longruling party 
that shed its communist appellation last spring then won 
multiparty elections 
he gained 833 of the more than 1300 votes officials said 
defeating radical reformer alexander tomov 
tomov won election to the partys 151member supreme council 
formerly its central committee 
lilov announced monday that he was stepping down to make way for 
a new more pragmatic leader 
but the announcement apparently was a tactical maneuver to 
elicit support and his reelection appeared a victory for 
conservative forces 
lilov 57 became party leader in february four months after 
hardline leader todor zhivkov was ousted since then however 
bulgaria has made fewer changes in its communist system than some 
of its eastern european neighbors 
lilov had served as chief ideologist of the communist party 
until zhivkov dropped him from the leadership in 1983 he rejoined 
the top ranks only after zhivkovs ouster 
progressive and conservative factions of the renamed party are 
now vying for control throughout the congress spokesmen for 
reform factions repeatedly called for lilovs replacement 
but the reformers were outnumbered and their candidates stood 
no chance against lilov a socialist party official said monday 
that reformers numbered about onethird of the delegates 
in june the communists won bulgarias first free elections in 
58 years since then however their popularity has waned as the 
economy sputtered basic foods like sugar and cooking oil are 
rationed and electric power is cut regularly 
the socialists ended weeks of deadlock over bulgarias 
presidency by agreeing last month to elect zhelyu zhelev leader of 
the democratic opposition he serves as the countrys chief of 
state 
despite his election government opposition has sometimes turned 
violent an angry crowd of protesters attacked burned and looted 
the socialist party headquarters on aug 26 
that attack was reportedly provoked by the socialists refusal 
to remove a red star from its headquarters 
on monday the party congress voted to remove all such symbols 
of the communist era from party buildings and adopted a new emblem 
a white rose on a red background 
the congress decided monday that its new chairman would be 
chosen by the whole congress not just the partys supreme council 
of about 150 members it has also elected a new party presidium and 
council

a woman who spends her days in a tent city near 
the kremlin said today the kgb had threatened to set fire to the 
protest encampment at night when there would be no witnesses the 
kgb denied it 
valentina philimonova one of 50 people camped on the grass 
every day outside the rossiya hotel said that a man she identified 
as a kgb agent had threatened to pour gasoline on the tents and set 
them alight if the people didnt end their protest against the 
failure of the government to provide adequate housing and jobs 
he said they would come at night when no one would see what 
was happening she said 
an officer at the kgbs press center said not only would the 
agency never attempt such provocations now but it would have 
been unthinkable even during the time of stagnation a reference 
to the era of the late soviet leader leonid i brezhnev 
it was not the first case of people approaching the tent city 
identifying themselves as kgb agents and trying to intimidate the 
protesters or provoking their anger said the officer who refused 
to give his name 
no one at kgb would allow it he said of the alleged threat 
ms philimonova lives in a wooden shack covered with slogans 
saying that president mikhail s gorbachev has failed to carry out 
his oath pledging to serve the people 
she is among dozens of people who inhabit and gather around the 
31 tents hoping someone will listen to their problems and punish 
those responsible for their plight 
some of the signs that adorn the tents and shacks denounce the 
communist party others tell of losing homes and jobs because the 
protesters had dared to criticize their bosses 
the protest began july 2 when the demonstrators arrived outside 
the enormous hotel near red square and put up the tents and shacks 
made of wood and plastic hoping to attract official attention and 
help against the local government they arrive at 8 am and leave 
at 9 pm 
so far the government has not responded to their protest

prime minister lothar de maiziere said today 
that east germans fear for their futures in a united germany and 
that social guarantees are needed to ease the move to a new 
society 
in a wideranging conversation with the associated press board 
of directors de maiziere also said the lingering specter of the 
former secret police is one of the most difficult legacies we 
have from the communist past 
east germanys first freely chosen leader in an address and 
during a questionandanswer session outlined his hopes for his 16 
million people as they move closer to german unification on oct 3 
he said east germans had the misfortune of living for four 
decades under a government in which their futures were decided by 
the communist hierarchy 
a tremendous obstacle will be teaching them to take control of 
their destinies to live successful lives in the competitive 
freemarket society epitomized by west germany he said 
the future in the past meant the future prescribed by the 
politburo he said now the people see their future is not a 
prescribed time but a free time this is something people did not 
learn and they are afraid of that 
he said the future government of a united germany must have a 
strong social consciousness to help east germans make the 
transition 
he also said the files on 6 million people compiled by the 
notorious secret police known as the stasi and the tens of 
thousands of people who worked for them are among the most 
difficult problems confronting the new society 
he said german law enforcment officials should have access to 
those files to punish people who committed crimes for the stasi 
and to rehabilitate people whose lives were ruined by the dreaded 
security apparatus 
but there should not be wide public access because the 
information contained in them could be damaging de maiziere said 
about 5000 stasi workers were used exclusively to listen to 
telephone conversations and the details in the files not only 
contain political views but information such as whether people were 
faithful to their spouses 
de maiziere will relinquish control of his country to west 
german chancellor helmut kohl on oct 3 
he said he has viewed his role as prime minister as that of a 
lawyer representing a very large client during the hard bargaining 
on the terms of unification and he would accept a similar role in 
a united germany 
however he said he has made no decision on whether to become 
one of the four east german ministers who will be added to kohls 
cabinet when the germanys unite 
meanwhile east germanys interior minister said today that he 
believed extremists from both the left and right were planning to 
disrupt unification celebrations next week in berlin 
petermichael diestel spoke hours after about 500 leftist 
protesters rampaged in central east berlin smashing windows at a 
major department store 
diestel speaking to reporters called monday nights incident a 
general rehearsal for disturbances he said were planned at the 
celebrations starting late next tuesday he did not say how he had 
learned of the plans

president mikhail s gorbachev today rejected 
exiled writer alexander solzhenitsyns recent proposals for 
replacing the soviet union with an allslavic state as 
disrespectful to other ethnic groups 
in his first public remarks on solzhenitsyns suggestions the 
59yearold soviet leader said they were unacceptable and sharply 
conflicted with his own views on how to restructure relations 
between the 15 soviet republics 
as a politician his views on the future of our multinational 
state are unacceptable gorbachev told the supreme soviet 
legislature they are far from reality these views have a 
destructive character 
gorbachevs remarks put him into a competition with 
solzhenitsyn a nobel laureate for the hearts and minds of the 
russian people and underscored the writers increasing importance 
in his article which appeared sept 18 in the reformist 
newspaper komsomolskaya pravda solzhenitsyn 71 called for 
spirituality over materialism and a unified slavic nation he 
criticized gorbachevs reforms 
solzhenitsyn suggested forming a russian union which would 
include the republics of russia byelorussia and the ukraine a 
large part of kazakhstan would also be included the other 12 
soviet republics including the rest of kazakhstan have different 
cultures and should be allowed to secede he said 
it was the first piece he has written directly for the russian 
people since he was exiled and stripped of his citizenship in 1974 
gorbachev said solzhenitsyns political views are all in the 
past the past russia the czarist monarchy 
for me the president added this is unacceptable 
gorbachev told lawmakers his goal in restructuring relations 
among the republics was a union of sovereign states where every 
people feels well and realizes its potential 
he responded to solzhenitsyns article at the request of a 
legislator from kazakhstan who objected to the call for russians 
to take control of some of his republics territory 
the lawmaker erkegali rakhmadiev said in an interview later 
that what solzhenitsyn was proposing was a hitlerite fascist 
approach to ethnic relations 
some ukrainians also bristled at solzhenitsyns proposed new 
union 
the independent news agency postfactum said tuesday the regional 
governing council in lvov in the western ukraine approved a 
statement saying that in solzhenitsyns article we are once 
again cast in the role of a small brother 
most of the soviet unions republics already have launched 
drives to wrest more power from moscow or to secede and the 
discussion of solzhenitsyns article came during debate on a new 
treaty to govern relations among the republics 
the soviet leader spoke from a lectern in the supreme soviets 
white marble meeting hall in the kremlin in a soft and calm voice 
making a rare public reference to his own russian heritage and to 
his roots in southern russia his deliberative tone contrasted 
sharply with his angry loud pronouncements in recent days in 
legislative debates on economic reform 
after reading the article twice gorbachev said he was 
possessed by very conflicting feelings 
as a russian i fully grasped the pain and alarm for the fate 
of the russian people for the fate of russia but at the same 
time as a russian i resolutely cannot agree with alexander 
isayevichs position in relation to other peoples in the most mild 
evaluation this is a disrespectful position 
despite his criticism of solzhenitsyns proposals gorbachev 
praised him as a great person with interesting thoughts 
solzhenitsyn who lives in canvendish vt described life in 
soviet prison camps in such acclaimed works as one day in the 
life of ivan denisovich and the gulag archipelago 
he was deported after the latter book was published in the west 
gorbachev restored the writers citizenship last month although 
solzhenitsyn has expressed reluctance about returning

president bush today asked the senate to 
swiftly approve an historic treaty ending the division of germany 
and relinquishing all rights and responsibilities of the four 
victorious powers from world war ii 
bush called the accord the culmination of more than four 
decades of western resolve and determination from the darkest 
hours of the cold war to the bright new horizons that stretch 
before us 
at a ceremony in the rose garden bush signed a letter formally 
transmitting the treaty to the senate secretary of state james a 
baker iii and west german ambassador juergen ruhfus witnessed the 
signing 
the treaty was signed in moscow on sept 12 by the united 
states soviet union britain and france after six months of 
negotiations the four powers will formally retain their rights 
over germany until they all have ratified the treaty however the 
four countries agreed to suspend their rights oct 1 two days 
before germany becomes unified through the merging of east and west 
germany 
it is wholly fitting that germany formally and irrevocably 
achieve its unified status at the earliest possible moment 
unfettered by fourpower rights shared by the soviet union which 
are now outmoded and unnecessary bushs letter said 
after the defeat of the nazis in 1945 the four allies divided 
germany and its capital into four occupation zones which became 
east and west germany and east and west berlin 
the treaty ends the division of the country and calls for the 
soviet union to complete the withdrawal of its estimated 370000 
troops from east germany by 1994 us british and french troops 
will remain stationed in berlin during the interim 
in his remarks bush said the treaty will end the artificial 
division of germany and berlin and it will restore to germany 
sovereignty over all its territory and end all remaining four power 
rights and responsibilities 
this agreement clears the way to achievement of the goal we 
americans have long shared with the german people a united 
democratic and sovereign germany the president said 
in his letter to the senate bush said the treaty represents a 
major achievement for our german allies who have not forgotten the 
past or the role germany once played in the horrors of 193345 but 
who have demonstrated over four decades of steadfast support for 
democracy and the western alliance what the world can expect from 
the united germany

a state appeals court will decide whether 
jailed savings and loan executive charles h keatings 5 million 
bail is excessive in a criminal fraud case involving the collapse 
of his lincoln savings 
keating 66 contends he is being made a scapegoat is broke and 
cannot defend himself against the host of lawsuits against him if 
he is locked up 
he is more than 5 million in debt he has no assets that are 
not already pledged to creditors at most keating could post a 
500000 bail and then only through the help of his children 
his lawyers said in papers filed with the state appeals court 
monday 
after a twoday hearing last week superior court judge gary 
klausner refused to lower the 5 million bail saying the charges 
against him are so serious he might flee 
that amount is far too high for keating to meet and 50 times 
higher than the bail imposed in identical cases his lawyers said 
they said he has shown he is no flight risk by never dodging any 
proceeding against him even though hes known for a year he was 
under criminal as well as civil investigation 
it wasnt clear when the 2nd district court of appeal would 
issue a decision on the bail appeal 
three other defendants are free they had their bails lowered 
from the original 1 million each to 100000 or 200000 which 
they posted 
all four are due back in court oct 5 to enter a plea to charges 
of defrauding investors in irvinebased lincoln 
keating and three former top officers of his companies are 
charged with misleading investors about the safety of risky junk 
bonds sold at lincoln branches the bonds were issued by lincolns 
parent company american continental corp which keating headed 
keating and the others are charged with ordering employees to 
steer lincoln depositors away from insured certificates of deposit 
and into the bonds many of the buyers were elderly and lost their 
life savings all told 17458 investors lost more than 250 
million prosecutors said 
the charges do not address the most central allegations in the 
lincoln case that he looted the thrift and made huge political 
donations to politicians who then pressured regulators to go easy 
on lincoln 
private analysts have estimated lincolns failure may cost 
taxpayers 2 billion that would make it the most costliest thrift 
failure yet surpassing the 17 billion bailout of miamis 
centrust bank

sales of existing homes rose 21 percent in 
august continuing a threemonth rebound a real estate trade group 
said today it forecast a slowdown in the fourth quarter because of 
rising mortgage rates 
the national association of realtors said house resales totaled 
a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 340 million units compared to 
julys revised 333 million rate sales rose 09 percent in june 
from the 1990 low of 330 million units in may 
despite rising rates the resale market is stable and slightly 
better than july said norman d flynn the realtors president 
the strength we see largely is due to people who are buying homes 
in less populous areas and recreational areas 
however realtors chief economist john a tuccillo said mortgage 
rates will rise during most of the fourth quarter having a 
negative impact on existinghome sales 
fixedrate 30year mortgage rates rose from 984 percent to 
1024 percent in august according to the federal home loan 
mortgage corp they averaged 1016 percent at the end of last week 
the realtors also said the national median existinghome price 
was 97000 in august down 13 percent from july but up 13 
percent from a year earlier the median means half of the homes 
cost more half less 
flynn said a decrease in the national median home price from 
july to august indicates sellers are bringing down prices in 
response to rising interest rates 
this is a typical occurrence he said 
sales climbed 69 percent to 140 million in the south where 
the median price was 86900 they rose 22 percent to 950000 
units in the midwest the median price there was 75000 
but sales fell 18 percent in the sluggish northeast to 550000 
units the median price in the northeast was 144900 they also 
dropped 38 percent to 530000 units in the west where the median 
price was 141600

jurors agreed that smoking killed a man 
whose family pursued a 17 million wrongful death lawsuit against 
the american tobacco co and a distributor but they did not award 
any financial damages 
we decided both parties were at fault said david roach 
foreman for the 12 lafayette county jurors we came to a decision 
we could all live with when viewing the alternative of a hung 
jury 
roach said he and eight other jurors thought the american 
tobacco co acted in an irresponsible way it was a very close 
decision we were fairly near a hung jury frankly 
the jury decided 93 monday that 35 years of smoking two packs 
of cigarettes a day had caused the 1987 lung cancer death of 
50yearold nathan henry horton 
the jurors half of them smokers heard 11 days of testimony 
about smoking risks and whether horton ran them by choice 
deliberations began monday and took about 5 hours 
the suit filed by horton and continued by his family named the 
american tobacco co and greenwood distributor new deal tobacco and 
candy co 
a first trial ended in a mistrial last year when jurors could 
not reach a verdict 
it was considered the most significant such case since a new 
jersey jury awarded a widower 400000 in 1988 after deciding a 
cigarette company was partly responsible for his wifes death from 
lung cancer in that case an appeals court this year overturned 
the award and ordered a new trial 
after mondays verdict horton family attorney don barrett of 
lexington asked circuit judge eugene bogen to award some sort of 
damages he also asked for a new trial on the issue of punitive 
damages 
bogen said he would rule later 
hortons widow ella mae horton of lexington refused to answer 
questions as she left the courtroom 
tobacco company lawyers said the verdict showed jurors were 
unwilling to decide whether horton or cigarettes were more 
responsible for his death 
one of them jim upshaw told jurors in closing arguments monday 
that horton was a risktaker and he made a free choice to 
smoke 
the familys attorneys contended horton he was unaware of the 
magnitude of the risks 
the hortons wanted 2 million in actual damages and 15 million 
in punitive damages 
warning labels have been required on cigarette packages since 
1966

entertainment giant mca inc parent of 
universal studios confirmed today that it is in buyout talks after 
a newspaper identified the potential suitor as matsushita electric 
industrial co of japan 
the news sent the companys stock price soaring 67 percent 
the wall street journal said people it did not identify who were 
familiar with the talks said the huge japanese consumer electronics 
manufacturer was considering acquiring mca for 80 to 90 a share 
or a range of about 67 billion to 75 billion 
in japan today a matsushita official who spoke on condition of 
anonymity said mca is one of the companies with which matsushita is 
involved in talks but that nothing has been decided 
later mca issued a statement in which it confirmed it is in 
discussions with a major international company regarding a possible 
negotiated acquisition of mca 
the discussions are continuing on a friendly basis no 
agreement has been reached there is no assurance that an agreement 
will be reached the statement said 
if the deal materialized it would be the second major 
transaction in which a japanese manufacturer of electronic hardware 
acquired a us maker of entertainment programs 
last year sony corp acquired columbia pictures entertainment 
inc for 5 billion the deal stirred criticism about japanese 
control of american assets mca based in universal city calif 
is the parent of universal studios and produces films and tv shows 
in addition to having interests in publishing and theme parks 
mca stock has been trading well below the deal price and its 
shares rocketed higher today on the new york stock exchange mca 
climbed 23 to 5750 a share when trading opened 
matsushitas brands include panasonic technics and quasar the 
company had revenue of about 444 billion in the year ended march 
31 
the journal report said individuals with knowledge of the talks 
cautioned that it was far from certain that a deal would 
materialize 
they said that regulatory barriers that did not figure in the 
sonycolumbia deal remain mca for instance owns an independent 
television station wwor in secaucus nj which a foreign company 
would be prevented from owning 
mca earned 19177 million on revenue of 338 billion last 
year a 16 percent increase over earnings of 16491 million and 
290 billion in revenue during 1988

the marine corps has grounded four harrier 
jets similar to those deployed in saudi arabia because of faulty 
sensors that help stabilize the fighterbombers the service said 
today 
col stuart wagner said the jets which can take off vertically 
and hover like helicopters were found to have defective rate 
sensor assemblies the assemblies are equivalent to the power 
steering on a car 
its not critical to flying the aircraft safely but its 
something we want to fix he said officials determined the rate 
sensor assemblies made by northrop corp are wearing out faster 
than projected 
wagner said the grounded harriers are based at kaneohe bay 
marine corps air station in hawaii the defects he said will have 
no effect on the harriers sent to saudi arabia in response to 
iraqs aug 2 invasion of kuwait 
the spokesman did not know when the harriers were grounded or 
how long they would be out of commission 
northrop pleaded guilty in february to 34 fraud charges of 
improperly testing the sensors and a cruise missile guidance system 
for the air force 
the harrier groundings were first reported today by the new york 
times and the los angeles times the marines fleet of nearly 200 
av8b harriers was expected to come up during a hearing today 
before the house committee on government operations 
we simply dont know whether the weapons will do their job 
said rep christopher shays rconn a committee member we may 
find that some of what our soldiers depend upon will not perform up 
to specification it may threaten the lives of many of our men and 
women in uniform 
no spare sensor assemblies are available forcing the marines to 
park the 22 million planes as problems arise no other company 
produces the assemblies 
a fifth harrier was to be grounded soon and the grounding of the 
rest of the fleet was scheduled at a rate of three planes every two 
months the newspapers said 
last year northrop was suspended from receiving new contracts 
for the sensor among other products 
northrop officials said monday they had no knowledge of the 
groundings

crude oil is within striking distance of 40 a 
barrel which would be equal to the record set 10 years ago and 
twice the price before the persian gulf crisis 
one piece of fresh news and 40 is there dean witter 
reynold inc trader ed kevelson predicted monday after crude 
futures crossed the 39 threshold for the first time on the new 
york mercantile exchange 
the price of light sweet crude the benchmark grade peaked for 
the day monday at 3920 before settling at 3825 for november 
delivery a record close on the exchange which began trading crude 
futures in 1983 
the oil markets slowed a bit this morning with light sweet 
crude trading 5 cents higher at 3830 a barrel in early trading 
weve just seen people step back annlouise hittle a 
senior oil analyst with shearson lehman brothers inc said today 
there really isnt fresh news from the middle east 
mondays rise came just a week after oil futures had first hit 
33 per barrel on the exchange setting off a steady climb that has 
shattered records in days or even hours 
the surge monday was set off by iraqi president saddam husseins 
statement that he would rather go to war than let the un trade 
embargo strangle his country 
because of that radio broadcast on sunday people are 
anticipating much higher costs in the future hittle had said 
monday people in the market are talking about 40 a barrel as 
being the next target 
that would be almost double the price before iraq invaded kuwait 
aug 2 and right at the level of cash prices that were paid in 
1980 after the iranian revolution 
higher oil creates a threat of inflation and typically leads to 
increases in gasoline prices at the pump an industry survey 
released sunday said the average price at the pump hit an alltime 
high of more than 138 a gallon up about 20 cents since the 
invasion 
but 40 oil today would not be as expensive in 
inflationadjusted terms as 40 oil was in 1980 
oil would have to hit about 57 per barrel in 1990 dollars to 
equal the real cost of oil from a decade earlier said philip l 
dodge an analyst with nomura securities international inc 
that is not far from the figure of 60 per barrel that some 
groups have used as an estimate for how high oil prices could rise 
during a shooting war in the mideast 
if theres a shooting war the skys the limit until 
governments step in and put in price controls and rationing and all 
that dodge said 
some experts have pointed out that gasoline has thus far not 
kept up with the rise in crude during the crisis 
forty dollars for crude oil is up about 20 from where it was 
before all this unpleasantness got started dodge said that 
20 increase is about 48 cents per gallon and so far the price of 
gasoline is only up about half of that it eventually could go up 
another 25 cents

the texas system of financing schools 
remains unconstitutional despite this years overhaul by the 
legislature a judge ruled today 
state district judge scott mccown said the 14 billionayear 
system is still flawed but he deferred making any immediate 
changes giving the legislature until sept 1 1991 to act 
our need for education is too great and our wealth too modest 
for inequitable funding our schools to be tolerated mccown 
wrote 
the judge said the finance system doesnt give all schools 
substantially equal access to funds 
the texas supreme court ruled unanimously last october that 
there were glaring disparities between rich and poor school 
districts violating a requirement in the state constitution for an 
efficient system of public schools 
schools were funded with local property taxes state aid and a 
small amount of federal funds but because of disparities in 
property wealth annual spending per student among districts ranged 
from 2112 to 19333 the court said 
the new school finance plan was adopted in june by the 
legislature after four special sessions lawmakers anted up an 
additional 528 million for public schools in 199091 and made 
numerous changes that backers said would improve education 
but poor school districts challenged the new funding plan they 
argued that it was no different from the old system 
the state will appeal todays ruling gov bill clements said 
i dont agree with his judgment at all clements said 
hes a young judge perhaps the supreme court in its review will 
reconsider that opinion 
kevin ohanlon a lawyer for the texas education agency said 
the 52page decision didnt give state officials enough direction 
on how fix the system 
he held it unconstitutional because it wasnt good enough but 
he didnt give us a heck of a lot of guidance on what would be good 
enough said ohanlon a former assistant attorney general 
he said that unless the courts tell the state how to make a 
constitutional system the litigation could last for years 
rick gray a lawyer for poor school districts that challenged 
the school funding system applauded the ruling he said mccown did 
a very exhaustive thorough analysis we think its a great 
day for all schoolchildren and we hope the legislature will set 
about the task of fixing the system in the future 
state rep paul colbert a member of the house public education 
committee blamed clements for blocking an alternative finance plan 
that poor school districts would have accepted clements killed 
that proposal by vetoing the taxes needed to pay for it 
its entirely because of gov clements footdragging and the 
republican legislators who upheld his veto that were back in the 
court again and were literally about to turn over the keys of the 
schoolroom to the courts colbert said 
clements killed two school finance reform plans because they 
each relied on a halfcent increase in the state sales tax he 
later agreed to a quartercent increase in the plan overturned by 
todays decision 
mccown allowed the school finance system to remain in place this 
school year but he retains jurisdiction over the case 
the judge said that if the legislature fails to devise a 
constitutional school finance plan by next september he would 
consider stopping the spending of state and local tax money or 
imposing a school spending plan

conservative prime minister brian mulroney heads 
into the new political season with an awesome array of worries 
ranging from rebellious indians and unpopular taxes to threats of a 
breakup of the confederation 
mulroney is in big trouble with voters scoring 14 percent or 
less in the polls but the opposition liberals have been unable to 
capitalize on mulroneys growing unpopularity and were drubbed in 
two recent provincial elections 
many canadians feel the country is leaderless and adrift 
both mulroney and liberal party leader jean chretien slipped out 
of sight for most of the summer and both may ultimately suffer for 
that 
mulroneys government is the most unpopular since the gallup 
organization began taking polls in the country 50 years ago the 
polls say the progressive conservatives are favored by only 20 
percent of the population 
at the end of july gallup asked canadians who would make the 
best prime minister mulroney chretien or socialist new 
democratic party chief audrey mclaughlin 
of those questioned 30 percent chose chretien 18 percent 
mclaughlin and 14 percent mulroney thirtyeight percent rejected 
all three or said they didnt know which one they liked 
there is a conjunction of events that has made the public 
rather cranky about politicians in general more so than usual 
said ron watts a professor of political science at queens 
university and director of the institute for intergovernmental 
relations we are going through an unusually bad patch 
the bad patch includes 
a country sliding into recession 
failure of the meech lake agreement to get quebec to sign the 
constitution 
a standoff between mohawk indians and the army over land 
rights 
a new 7 percent goods and services tax scheduled to go into 
effect in january on virtually everything 
the commitment of canadian ships and fighters in the persian 
gulf crisis 
a series of patronage appointments to the senate including 
conservative nova scotia premier john buchanan currently under 
criminal investigation 
quebec premier robert bourassa has formed a commission to study 
what steps the frenchspeaking province should take next 
independence sovereignty in association with canada or some other 
form of relationship with the central government a report is due 
next spring 
to make matters worse mulroneys former quebec lieutenant 
lucien bouchard betrayed him and formed a separatist bloc 
quebecois in the house of commons dedicated to independence for 
quebec 
mulroney dismisses the bad news in the polls 
what matters is where you are on election night not some two 
or 2 years before he said 
but mulroneys low profile for much of the summer has led many 
canadians to feel he has been avoiding the tough questions 
it seems to have been an eternity this summer and through all 
this mr mulroney has pulled a disappearing act said liberal 
jeanrobert gauthier 
chretien whose showing in the polls has slipped since he won 
the liberal leadership in june also is suffering 
bad news for the conservatives usually means good news for the 
liberals but not lately the fallout has become impossible to 
read 
both parties were thrashed in the ontario provincial elections 
in august the socialist new democrats ousted the liberals from the 
government of canadas richest province and in the manitoba 
provincial elections a week later the conservatives won a 
majority shoving the liberals into third place behind the new 
democrats who are to the left of the liberals 
ontario new democratic party leader bob rae profited from voter 
unhappiness with liberal premier david peterson that 
disgruntlement stemmed partly from new provincial taxes and a 
political party financing scandal but voters appeared to be put 
off mainly because peterson called an unnecessary election two 
years early a move seen as purely selfserving 
fringe movements are growing the rightist reform party a child 
of western canada recently moved onto the national scene with 6 
percent in the polls bouchards bloc quebecois has 5 percent 
ultimately if we end up with an array of regional parties 
that will seriously weaken the federal system watts said 
no matter what ones opinion of mulroney he can hardly be 
called a donothing prime minister having worked hard for the free 
trade agreement with the united states the goods and services tax 
and the meech lake agreement 
the trouble is people are not happy with what he is doing 
watts said the perception of weakness weakens the leader even if 
the leader is not really weak 
it seems the canadian people themselves are unsure of what they 
want 
said university of calgary analyst david bercuson because 
they dont really indicate any overall general direction to the 
leadership the leadership doesnt know what to do

soviet foreign minister eduard 
shevardnadze today said that war could break out in the persian 
gulf at any moment and called iraqs invasion of kuwait an act 
of terrorism 
in a speech to the general assembly shevardnadze referred to 
aug 2 the date of the invasion as black thursday and called 
the action irrational 
iraq flagrantly violated the united nations charter the 
principles of international law the universally recognized norms 
of morality and the standards of civilized behavior the minister 
said he spoke in russian and his remarks were translated into the 
many languages of those attending 
shevardnadze spoke on the second day of the general assembly 
sesssion on monday leaders from france iran brazil argentina 
poland and indonesia condemned iraq for invading kuwait and 
demanded an immediate pullout 
the soviet foreign minister hinted at the possibility of a 
united nations military operation in the gulf region noting that 
the united nations has the power to suppress acts of 
aggression 
there is ample evidence that this right can be exercised he 
said but such an step should come only after all peaceful 
nonmilitary forms of pressure have been applied he said 
up until the invasion the soviet union was iraqs strongest 
ally but the soviets have firmly sided with the usled effort to 
isolate and pressure the baghdad government the soviets have said 
they might be willing to participate in a un military effort in 
the gulf provided that the soviets share command 
the soviet foreign minister termed iraqs actions a major 
affront to mankind and added unless we find a way to respond 
to it and cope with the situation our civilization will be thrown 
back by half a century 
a great war may break out on the gulf region any day any 
moment an act of terrorism has been perpetrated against the 
emerging new world order 
shevardnadze also called for the creation of an international 
tribunal to judge individuals who declare the threat for 
purposes of blackmail of using weapons of mass destruction 
hostagetaking or mass terror 
it was a clear reference to iraqi president saddam hussein who 
has threatened to destroy israel if the security councils economic 
embargo causes his people to suffer and has moved western 
detainees to strategic sites in iraq to serve as human shields 
against any attack 
such a tribunal could also judge those who resort to torture 
terrorism atrocities or any other grave crimes against 
humanity said shevardnadze 
later today the soviet minister was to preside over a special 
meeting of the security council attended by up to 12 foreign 
ministers the session is expected to end with passage of a 
resolution extending to air corridors the unordered embargo on 
trade with iraq and occupied kuwait 
secretary of state james a baker iii is expected to fill the 
us seat in the 15member council 
on monday after shevardnadze and british foreign minister 
douglas hurd held a twohour private meeting reporters asked if 
the air embargo would be approved i hope so said hurd 
shevardnadze nodded confidently he said through a translator 
we want action there is no other way 
it is a fairly balanced draft that takes care of the safety of 
air flights but at the same time continues the idea of sanctions 
until iraq agrees to withdraw from kuwait said soviet ambassador 
yuli vorontsov president of the security council 
the air embargo would ask all nations to bar flights to and from 
iraq but it would not authorize shooting down airplanes 
on monday the council adopted a brief resolution calling for 
aid to nations suffering economic hardship from loss of trade with 
iraq they include jordan and about a dozen other nations 
every speaker who strode to the rostrum of the general assembly 
on monday denounced iraq for its aug 2 seizure of kuwait in his 
address french president francois mitterrand declared kuwait is 
a sovereign state a member of the international community in the 
name of what can one decide that this state has ceased to exist 
the iraqi un ambassador abdul amir alanbari listened 
impassively at his seat iraqs foreign minister tariq aziz 
stayed away after us officials barred him from coming on a 
special iraqi flight 
irans foreign minister ali akbar velayati told the gathering 
that his government would obey all security council sanctions and 
embargoes targeting iraq however a security and oil industry 
sources have said iran has agreed to provide humanitarian food 
and medicine shipments across the common border with iraq in return 
for 200000 barrels of refined oil a day 
velayati also criticized the us military buildup in the 
persian gulf region which intends to counter iraqi as 
destabilizing

chief warrant officer 
charles rowe shipped out of beirut a day before the 1983 
truckbombing that killed 241 us serviceman he had a private vow 
for any terrorist who tried it here 
ill promise you hell suffer he said were going to 
hurt him 
rowe and fellow marines guarding a vital port in northeast saudi 
arabia said no comparisons should be drawn between lebanon and the 
new mission in the mideast operation desert shield 
but they concede their security planning is shrouded by memories 
of the beirut attack 
i wouldnt mind evening the score rowe said 
the memories are so strong that the commander of the persian 
gulf ports security unit that reporters visited on tuesday said at 
times he had to urge superiors not to go overboard with the 
precautions 
any time you overdo it you bring attention to it lt col 
tom hayden said any dumb terrorist can say hey that looks 
important id just as soon keep a low profile 
the port is far from the iraqi ground forces to the north in 
kuwait and iraq has no navy to speak of so haydens main worries 
are air or terroriststyle ground attacks 
he says hes confident american fighter jets could turn back any 
iraqi fighters and the army is helping the marines with a patriot 
missile battery at the port designed to destroy any incoming 
missiles 
that leaves a car or truck bombing as the main threat hayden 
said adding such an attack could come from a group sponsored by 
iraqs saddam hussein or any of the other groups who have been 
trying to blow up americans for 10 years 
his unit was on maximum alert for several days two weeks ago 
after we were told something was possible and i reacted to it 
he said the heightened alert was based on one specific piece of 
information but refused to discuss it 
we have since lessened and were at what i would call a 
routine posture right now he said 
routine still means constant patrols along the persian gulf and 
the perimeter of the sprawling port a camp for marines as well as 
a major arrival point for equipment and supplies for the thousands 
of american troops here 
hayden like the men below him tries to steer visitors away 
from the beirut analogy 
in lebanon the marines were part of a peacekeeping force 
crowded together in a makeshift barracks in an airport 
administrative building ordered not to assume defensive positions 
but instead to allow elements of the fractious lebanese army to 
provide their security 
if we could have done in lebanon what were doing here it 
wouldnt have happened hayden said 
hayden is deploying his security forces as he says it should 
have been done in beirut if only the marines there had the 
authority to defend themselves 
wee constantly changing positions changing patrols and 
changing routines hayden said 
the marines also are engaging in a fair share of deception 
setting up mock guard posts and camoflauge tents over junk 
there are some facilities that have guards that have no value 
at all hayden said 
he concedes marines would make an attractive terrorist target a 
successful attack would send shudders through an american public 
that remembers well the beirut bombing of oct 23 1983 when a 
suicide attacker crashed through the marine barracks gates in a 
bombladen truck fundamentalist shiites claimed responsibility 
hayden said it would be foolish for terrorists to target the 
marines again 
i think it would be a mistake he said they would look 
for a softer spot it wont happen again 
capt wayne sparks was one of the replacements sent to beirut 
after the bombing younger marines sometimes ask him about his 
experience and whether they are as vulnerable 
they ask what the terrorist threat is what kinds of things 
could an enemy do to us said sparks 35 of portsmouth ohio 
sparks said he had no qualms about returning to the middle east 
im a marine he said i do what im responsible to do and 
i dont question it 
rowe said he was satisfied with the security here which he said 
relies on dispersion and great vigilance 
he says he knew 50 to 60 of the men killed in beirut just after 
he left and was close friends with a half dozen of them 
i think that every marine is aware of it and those of us who 
were in beirut are more aware of it rowe said but you cant 
allow it to dominate your life if you do you give in to fear and 
the terrorist wins

a tv film tonight about charles stuart who 
allegedly shot his pregnant wife summoned police over his car 
phone and later apparently killed himself sacrifices privacy to 
profit the womans family says 
while we agree that the first amendment must provide 
protection to legitimate journalists we decry its use as a shield 
by those who profit by producing entertainment without 
authorization carol stuarts parents giusto and evelyn dimaiti 
and her brother carl said in a statement monday 
the cbs movie sets a dangerous precedent that could 
sacrifice the privacy of other grieving families for the sake of 
movie profits they said 
cbs publicist ed devlin said the network had no response to make 
to the familys criticism producer arnold shapiro did not 
immediately return a telephone call seeking comment today 
in general docudramas can be made without the consent of those 
involved as long as they stick to public records individuals who 
sell the rights to their stories to producers essentially sell the 
rights to their private stories 
good night sweet wife a murder in boston stars ken olin of 
thirtysomething as stuart 
the movie was produced in association with arnold shapiro who 
was taping a segment of the show rescue 911 in boston when mrs 
start was slain oct 30 the rescue of the stuarts was shown on the 
tv program 
mrs stuart was fatally shot in the head during what her husband 
claimed was a robbery by a black man the white couples son who 
was delivered prematurely by caesarean section died 17 days later 
stuart was shot in the side but recovered 
in january stuart apparently jumped to his death from a bridge 
after learning that his brother matthew had implicated him in his 
wifes slaying 
public interest in the crime was heightened by a dramatic 
taperecorded telephone conversation between stuart and an 
emergency dispatcher who tracked down the stuarts location to send 
an ambulance 
the crime shocked bostonians and heightened racial tensions the 
crimes hold on the public imagination grew greater still when it 
became clear that the prime suspect was stuart himself 
matthew stuarts involvement in the slaying remains under 
investigation his lawyer nancy gerttner said he was distressed 
by the movie 
we deeply regret the television portrayal of these events at 
this time which are based only on the media accounts which are 
distorted and which are obviously without the participation of any 
of the principals gertner said 
the dimaiti family called on anyone profiting from the movie 
including advertisers to donate money to the carol dimaiti stuart 
foundation it provides scholarships to youths in mission hill the 
poor neighborhood where she was shot

the nations economy nearly came to a 
standstill in the second quarter edging up a feeble annual rate of 
04 percent the government said tuesday many of the nations top 
economists believe a recession is imminent if not under way 
already 
while white house spokesman marlin fitzwater said we dont 
believe we are in a recession right now he acknowledged the 
latest commerce department report on the gross national product 
is certainly cause for concern its not good news 
the departments revised report on the gnp the nations total 
output of goods and services was the lowest since a 03 percent 
rate during the last quarter of 1989 and showed the economy 
weakening even before the persian gulf crisis 
the economy was headed toward a recession before iraq and 
iraq was just the nail in the coffin said allen sinai chief 
economist for the boston co a recession seems inescapable he 
said 
surveys following iraqs aug 2 invasion of kuwait and the 
subsequent oilprice spiral showed many top economists 
forecasting an imminent recession 
the national association of business economists reported tuesday 
that more than half of the 71 professional forecasters responding 
to its survey in late august and early september said a recession 
already has begun or will begin in the fourth quarter of 1990 or 
the first quarter of 1991 
and half of the top economists surveyed each month by blue chip 
economic indicators now believe the economy will enter a recession 
this year 
in a sharp revision of earlier views 50 percent of the 50 
panel members replying now think the longdelayed recession 
will start this year wrote rj eggert the newsletters editor 
of those expecting the recession to begin this year three 
believe it actually began in the second quarter six expect the 
downturn to begin in the current quarter and 16 have pegged the 
fourth quarter of this year as the starting date 
sinai pointed to negative economic data already available for 
july and august and said it looks like the recession started in 
the third quarter 
the economy ground to a halt in the second quarter and is in 
the process of contracting right now added richard w rahn 
chief economist for the us chamber of commerce 
a price index tied to the gnp was unchanged at an annual rate of 
39 percent in the second quarter but with the surge in oil 
prices inflation as measured in the consumer price index jumped 
08 percent in august alone the higher prices will be reflected in 
the thirdquarter gnp report 
the price of oil before the iraqi invasion was less than 20 a 
barrel it reached a record 38 a barrel at one point on monday 
since oil is used in producing so many consumer goods as well as 
for heating and transportation any price increase not only slashes 
available funds needed to feed economic growth but also feeds 
inflation 
the department originally had estimated the economy grew at a 
12 percent rate from april through june after advances of 17 
percent in the first quarter and 25 percent in 1989 and 45 
percent in 1988 
but it said tuesday that more complete data showed weaker net 
exports and lower inventory accumulation than first thought 
the new data showed net exports declining by 92 billion rather 
than 45 billion and inventories totaling 198 billion rather 
than 224 billion 
but there really were no areas of strength sinai said 
consumer spending which represents twothirds of the nations 
economic activity rose just 02 percent down from 11 percent in 
the first quarter business investment fell 47 percent after a 5 
percent gain from january through march 
housing construction plunged 112 percent after advancing 151 
percent in the first quarter government spending rose 62 percent 
but most of that was by the federal government state and local 
spending was down 06 percent 
if the economy were in a recession generally described as two 
consecutive quarters of negative growth it would end the nearly 
eight years of expansion that began after the 198182 downturn 
the commerce department also reported today that aftertax 
corporate profits fell a revised 06 percent worse than the 02 
percent drop first reported and their poorest showing since a 59 
percent decline in the third quarter of 1989 they had risen 05 
percent in the first quarter and 17 percent in the final quarter 
of 1989 
the various changes left the gnp growing by 45 billion in the 
second quarter after removing the effects of inflation the gnp 
totaled an annual rate of 416 trillion

soviet foreign minister eduard shevardnadze said today that the 
persian gulf could be on the verge of war and he hinted at the 
possibility of a un military operation in the region 
as shevardnadze spoke on the second day of the 45th general 
assembly the un security council prepared to vote on extending 
the naval embargo on iraq to the air 
the financial markets meanwhile reflected world pessimism over 
the possibilty of a settlement in the near future to the persian 
gulf crisis gold prices rose 15 an ounce in hong kong helped the 
new york stock exchange hit a 14month low and had oil prices 
flirting with 40 a barrel 
the general assembly has become a forum for world leaders to 
vent their rage at baghdad 
in his speech shevardnadze referred to aug 2 the date of the 
invasion as black thursday 
iraq flagrantly violated the united nations charter the 
principles of international law the universally recognized norms 
of morality and the standards of civilized behavior the minister 
said 
he hinted at the possibility of a un military operation 
noting that the united nations has the power to suppress acts of 
aggression 
up until the invasion the soviet union was iraqs strongest 
ally but the soviets have firmly sided with the usled effort to 
isolate and pressure the baghdad government 
war may break out on the gulf region any day any moment 
shevardnadze said 
on monday french president francois mitterrand issued a strong 
message to iraq 
there is no compromise as long as iraq does not comply with 
resolutions of the security council and withdraw from kuwait the 
sovereignty of that country is not negotiable he told the 
assembly 
but he also held out the possibility of peace 
if iraq were to withdraw its troops and free the hostages 
everything might be possible mitterrand said iraq is preventing 
several thousand westerners from leaving kuwait and iraq 
mitterrand was suggesting that after an iraqi pullout other 
areas of discord in the middle east could be discussed 
iraqi president saddam hussein has said he will not consider 
abandoning kuwait unless israel leaves the arab territories it has 
held since 1967 
although every foreign leader who spoke monday joined mitterrand 
in assailing iraq saddam did not appear to be backing down the 
french foreign ministry said today that iraqi soldiers have taken 
two new french nationals hostage in kuwait and transported them to 
an unknown destination 
there was little indication today of a breakthrough in tehran 
where syrian president hafez assad newly aligned with the west 
since the crisis broke out has been tryingto get leaders to pledge 
full observance of the un embargo 
assad left tehran today after a fourday visit but sources said 
he failed to get an iranian pledge not to send food and other 
essentials to iraq 
sources close to the syrian delegation said tehran reiterated 
its pledge to uphold embargo rules but insisted that the embargo 
allows humanitarian shipments of food 
on sunday saddam declared he would rather go to war than let a 
unordered trade embargo strangle his country a day later he 
insisted that kuwait belongs to iraq and we will never give it up 
even if we have to fight over it for a thousand years 
his comments have caused jitters in financial markets because 
oil prices would shoot up if war broke out and more expensive oil 
would fuel inflation 
the price of crude has already almost doubled since iraq invaded 
oilrich kuwait on aug 2 prompting president bush to send tens of 
thousands of us troops to saudi arabia to lead a multinational 
force standing up to saddam 
in tokyo where the market was closed monday the nikkei stock 
average today closed down 41851 points or 176 percent the close 
2335932 was the indexs lowest in 33 months 
analysts said that like the skyrocketing oil prices and market 
declines elsewhere on monday the drop in the nikkei reflected the 
belief among investors that an extensive us conflict with iraq is 
inevitable 
oil prices peaked at 3920 before settling at 3825 monday on 
the futures market in new york some say the price will reach 60 
if war breaks out 
gold which shoots up in value in times of uncertaint rose 
1503 today in hong kong to close at 40445 
in new york on monday the dow jones industrial average tumbled 
5941 points to 245297 a 14month low 
as leaders from brazil argentina poland and indonesia 
condemned baghdad monday at the united nations iraqs un 
ambassador abdul amir alanbari listened impassively from his 
seat 
iraqi foreign minister tariq aziz scheduled to address the 
general assembly next week was not present the united states has 
not given its permission for an iraqi airways flight to bring aziz 
delegation to new york and iraq has so far refused to make 
arrangements through another carrier 
in his speech to the assembly iranian foreign minister ali 
akbar velayati criticized both iraq and the united states which he 
said was using the military buildup to back its imperial designs on 
the persian gulf region 
bush issued his own tough message monday after speaking to 
about 150 representatives of arabamerican groups in washington he 
was asked by a participant why he would not talk directly with 
saddam 
the president said iraq would have to first pull out of kuwait 
restore the former kuwaiti leadership and assure the safety of 
americans 
were not going to yield one inch on those provisions he 
said 
in other developments 
the exiled emir of kuwait sheik jaber alahmed alsabah left 
today for new york for his first public appearance outside saudi 
arabia since iraq invaded his country sheik jaber is to address 
the un general assembly on thursday and meet bush on friday

arab emirates the italian government said the eight tornado will

the last leader of a sovereign east germany 
said tuesday his people are truly afraid as they prepare to join 
the competitive freethinking and robust society next door 
lothar de maiziere in a wideranging talk with the associated 
press board said his nations 16 million people will need help to 
thrive in a new world based on initiative and free enterprise 
he said east germans forced to live in a communist society for 
four decades have grown accustomed to a life in which their 
futures and their jobs were largely preordained by the 
government 
although most east germans desperately desire the german 
unification that takes place oct 3 de maiziere said they realize 
they will be expected to take control of their individual 
destinies 
the future in the past meant the future prescribed by the 
politburo he said now the people see their future is not a 
prescribed time but a free time this is something people did not 
learn and they are afraid of that 
he said the government of a united germany must have a strong 
social consciousness to help east germans make the transition and 
avoid becoming a secondclass population 
de maiziere a 50yearold lawyer will turn over to west 
germany the leadership of his nation in just eight days 
he was east germanys first freely chosen leader and guided it 
through a rocky sixmonth period of tough negotiations on the 
terms and timing of unification 
he said he has made no decision on whether to accept one of the 
four new cabinet posts that will be filled by east germans in the 
newly expanded government of west german chancellor helmut kohl 
but de maiziere said he has viewed his role as prime minister as 
that of a lawyer representing a very large client and he would 
accept a similar role in a united germany 
he defended his people who critics say will be bringing nothing 
to a united germany but debts social problems a questionable work 
ethic and a crumbling economy 
he said east germans did not choose their system which was 
imposed by the soviets and remains a legacy of the war started by 
the nazis the nation de maiziere said is part of german history 
and the cradle of the culture that gave the world bach goethe and 
handel 
he said the former communist secret police that entwined the 
nation for 40 years remains one of the old regimes most 
difficult legacies 
tens of thousands of people worked for the dreaded security 
apparatus which compiled intimate dossiers on 6 million people 
he said german law enforceent officials should have access to 
those files to punish people who committed crimes for the secret 
police and to help others whose lives were ruined by it 
but there should not be wide public access because the 
information contained in them could be damaging divisive and 
distorted de maiziere said 
about 5000 secret police workers were used exclusively to 
listen to telephone conversations he said and the details in the 
files not only contain political views but reveal whether people 
were faithful to their spouses 
each file on a particular person also contains on average the 
names and activities of 40 to 50 other people who came in contact 
with that person 
de maiziere said he chose not to read his own file when 
questions arose about whether he cooperated with the secret police 
but allowed respected leaders to do it for him he was subsequently 
cleared 
he also said he hoped for a political solution in the persian 
gulf crisis and believes a united germany will refute critics who 
say it is too preoccupied with itself to assume a role of global 
leadership 
he credited president bush former president reagan and soviet 
president mikhail s gorbachev for creating the political climate 
that made german unity possible

ousted prime minister benazir bhutto 
and her political foes launched campaigns tuesday for next months 
elections which are seen as a forum on whether her government was 
wrongly dismissed 
ms bhuttos 20monthold government was forced out aug 6 on 
charges of corruption incompetence and abuse of power she has 
been ordered to stand trial next week before a special onejudge 
court in the eastern city of lahore on charges of corruption and 
misconduct 
the armybacked caretaker government on tuesday filed corruption 
charges against ms bhuttos fatherinlaw and two more former 
cabinet ministers 
a special tribunal in karachi is scheduled to decide later this 
week whether ms bhutto must stand trial on two other corruption 
charges if convicted by the tribunal she could be disqualified 
from next months poll and barred from politics for seven years 
the elections set for oct 24 three years ahead of schedule 
are seen as a referendum on president ghulam ishaq khans decision 
to dismiss ms bhuttos government he used constitutional powers 
to do so but she called it a thinly veiled coup 
the alliance opposing ms bhutto known as the islami jamhoori 
ittehad or islamic democratic alliance is scrambling to prop up a 
crumbling alliance long enough to defeat her in next months 
election 
the alliance cut deals with smaller parties spanning the range 
of the ideological spectrum from islamic fundamentalism to secular 
socialism 
this is a fight against bhuttos pakistan peoples party 
said ijaz ulhaq campaign manager for the alliance and son of the 
late gen mohammad zia ulhaq who ruled pakistan for 11 years 
until his death in a 1988 plane crash there is so much pressure 
on everyone that we have to fight together to get the peoples 
party out 
alliance leader nawaz sharif launched its campaign at an 
election rally at the eastern village of gujranwala in pakistans 
populous punjab province 
ms bhutto who won election in november 1988 and became the 
first woman to lead a modern moslem nation is a candidate for five 
seats in the 217member national assembly the policymaking lower 
house of parliament 
the former prime minister said her party will participate in the 
elections even if she herself is disqualified 
if im stopped from taking part dont lose heart work to 
make the party successful she told a crowd of about 4000 
supporters on tuesday in a village on the outskirts of karachi her 
hometown 
ms bhutto has vehemently denied any wrongdoing and repeatedly 
accused the president of corruption and nepotism 
the caretaker government has spent much of the past month trying 
to portray ms bhuttos administration as the most corrupt in 
pakistans 43year history 
but many pakistanis consider the special tribunals like the ones 
that will consider her case to be kangaroo courts and say the 
scenario evokes memories of ms bhuttos father 
the late zulfikar ali bhutto was overthrown in a 1977 coup and 
a special tribunal ordered him hanged in 1979

the pentagon is continuing to activate reserve 
forces for operation desert shield but the total callup is likely 
to fall well short of the 50000 authorized by defense secretary 
dick cheney military sources say 
the pentagon today said callups of reserves from all services 
have reached 21970 an increase of 317 from its previous tally 
announced last week 
pete williams the chief pentagon spokesman said another 4620 
army national guard and army reserve members will be called up on 
thursday rassing the total to 26590 
spokesman maj doug hart said the latest tally included a 
decline of 156 in the previously announced total for the army he 
said this was due to a counting error in the pentagons earlier 
tally the navys total rose by 183 the coast guard added 290 and 
the air force total was unchanged 
additional callups late this week are expected to bring the 
servicewide total to about 26000 
president bush authorized use of the reserves on aug 22 it is 
the first reserve callup since the vietnam war 
cheney told a house committee last week that he expected nearly 
50000 reserves to be on active duty by sept 30 but a military 
source said monday the total is unlikely to exceed 40000 and that 
it would take several more weeks to reach even that total the 
source spoke on condition he not be identified 
its not going to be anywhere near the 50000 figure 
projected by cheney the source said unless war with iraq breaks 
out in the case of war the pentagon would be expected to activate 
far more reserves including combat units 
it was not immediately clear whether the services had scaled 
back their original projections of how many reserves would be 
needed or whether cheney had miscalculated 
in response to a reporters inquiry the pentagon issued a 
statement monday evening saying cheneys original approval of the 
callup plan was designed to allow the services a maximum amount 
of flexibility to meet their needs 
at present it is not possible to forecast whether the needs 
of the services will come up to the nearly 50000 total 
authorized by cheney the statement said 
bushs decision to mobilize the reserves marked an important 
political moment in the administrations campaign to try to force 
iraqs army out of kuwait 
weekend warriors from around the country have been forced to 
leave their jobs families and communities to provide medical 
transportation airlift and other services in support of operation 
desert shield in the gulf region 
those placed on active duty are obliged to serve 90day tours 
and the period can be extended another 90 days if cheney decides 
the extra help is needed 
when cheney signed an order aug 23 approving a reserve 
activation plan his spokesman pete williams said as many as 
49703 reserves could be placed on active duty by oct 1 he said 
the actual number was likely to be about 46000 because the marine 
corps did not plan to use the 3000 reserves it was allowed to 
call 
williams stressed that the services would call up only what we 
need and only when we need it but the total was likely to be 
near the figure authorized by cheney 
last week the army navy and air force activated more than 7000 
reserves and the army announced that it had alerted 24 reserves 
units in 13 states and puerto rico to prepare for activation

the european communitys chief executive tuesday 
challenged german leaders to pledge that the merger of east and 
west would not weaken their support for european economic union 
are the germans truly interested in economic and monetary 
union asked jacques delors president of the european 
commission we need clear unambiguous political commitments 
without them there is a risk of a weak europe with a strong 
germany in its midst 
delors unusually blunt remarks at a forum on germanys future 
role in europe reflected apprehensions among western european 
leaders about the consequences of german unification next week 
some such as british prime minister margaret thatcher fear 
germany will aggressively dominate a unified western europe others 
fear the germans will lose interest in ec integration as they turn 
their energies toward central and eastern europe 
french president francois mitterrand another speaker at 
tuesdays forum said unification will pose a formidable challenge 
for businesses in neighboring countries 
he accused some french executives of timidity saying they 
should be pursuing markets inside germany 
this sort of dynamism this audacity i expect it from the 
french mitterrand said 
delors said the future of european integration was linked 
entirely to germanys ability to decide on key policy issues within 
the next few months 
ive felt disoriented by the contradictory declarations of 
german officials in recent weeks he said 
karl otto poehl president of the west german central bank has 
rejected rapid moves toward european monetary union poehl and west 
german finance minister theo waigel maintain the 12 ec nations are 
not ready to create a european central bank 
however chancellor helmut kohl and foreign minister 
hansdietrich genscher are pushing for rapid european monetary and 
political union genscher has backed a plan offered by the ec 
commission to begin putting together a european central bank as 
early as 1993 
delors said the germans were being unrealistic if they expected 
perfect economic convergence among all 12 ec members before 
monetary union occurred he said the time had come to fix the 
dates for union 
mitterrand said he accepted the fact that germany would emerge 
from unification with greater economic clout 
if the development of germany is incitement to do more than 
its a good thing he said this competition will enable us to 
show what france is capable of 
mitterrand said he considered unification to be a right of the 
german people who cannot pay the price forever for a horrible 
war lost in 1945 
no government official in western europe has been as outspoken 
about german unity as britains former trade and industry 
secretary nicholas ridley he resigned in july after telling an 
interviewer that the uppity germans were trying to dominate 
europe 
the push for monetary union was a german racket designed to 
take over the whole of europe he said 
of the european commission he said im not against giving up 
sovereignty in principle but not to this lot you might just as 
well give it to adolf hitler frankly 
ridleys views were regarded widely as being shared privately by 
a large segment of thatchers conservative party 
britain and france were offered advice monday in an oped 
article in the international herald tribune 
dominique moisi associate director of the french institute of 
international relations and lawrence freedman professor at kings 
college in london said their governments should increase bilateral 
security cooperation 
they both recognize a need to balance growing german power 
the authors wrote they must show the rest of europe that they 
work in concert and not just in parallel

congress today took the first step to delay 
85 billion in imminent spending cuts while the white house said it 
would rather negotiate into the night than accept a delay 
republicans were almost unanimous in opposition as the house 
appropriations committee approved 3220 a catchall bill that 
would keep government operations going for an additional 20 days 
until oct 20 to provide more time for negotiatiors to reach an 
agreement on deficit reduction 
in an effort to discourage president bushs promised veto the 
committee attached to the bill an additional 21 billion to 
finance us participation in operation desert shield in the 
persian gulf 
why hold american troops in saudi arabia hostage demanded 
rep mickey edwards rokla this the desert shield money wont 
protect it the president does intend to veto it 
the legislation would double to 12 months the time for which 
the president may call up reserves for the middle east operation 
the committee sidestepped another major foreign policy question 
bushs proposal to forgive 67 billion worth of egyptian debt in 
appreciation of egypts assistance in the persian gulf 
amid indications the committee would have refused to forgive the 
debt rep david obey dwis offered and the panel approved 
an amendment that would allow aid to egypt to continue despite a 
failure to repay past assistance 
stripped from the legislation known as a continuing resolution 
was a section aimed at discouraging the national endowment for 
the arts from supporting any indecent antireligious or obscene 
picture play or writing 
rep jamie whitten dmiss chairman of the committee said 
failure of congress to block arbitrary spending cuts due to take 
effect next week would bring the economy to its knees we 
cant afford the risk 
rep silvio conte of massachusetts senior republican on the 
panel said one extension of the deadline would only lead to 
another delay a fullblown crisis may be the only way to force 
a deficit reduction he said 
white house spokesman marlin fitzwater repeated today that bush 
would veto any legislation that would delay acrosstheboard 
spending reductions house speaker thomas s foley dwash and 
other democratic leaders are urging an extension in hopes of 
resolving the yearlong budget stalemate 
the cuts called a sequester will take place unless the 
targets of the grammrudman law are modified or delayed and will 
mean acrosstheboard reductions of up to 40 percent throughout the 
government 
we want to avoid a sequester we are willing to negotiate into 
the night fitzwater said 
he was asked about reports that one immediate impact of the 
spending cuts would be the cancellation beginning monday of all 
us commercial flights after 6 pm 
the flights would be cancelled because of sharp cutbacks in air 
traffic controllers and in evening operation of us weather 
forecasting stations 
were concerned about it just like were concerned about all 
the cuts fitzwater said but if you think this seems 
draconian you aint seen nothing yet youre going to see a lot 
more dramatic and difficult things to deal with than night 
flights 
negotiators from the two sides met in a back room of the capitol 
until nearly 1230 am today emerging to say they were still 
searching for a deal 
were making progress in cutting spending but were not quite 
there white house chief of staff john sununu told reporters 
the major sticking point to a fiveyear 500 billion 
deficitreduction deal has been over whether to slash the tax rate 
on capital gains the profits from the sale of investments bush 
says the reduction would boost the economy democrats insisting 
the break would aid the wealthy have refused to accept it without 
a compensating tax increase on upperincome people 
the seemingly endless negotiations have left the government 
staring at the start of the new fiscal year next monday with no 
budget spending bills or other fiscal legislation in place 
its a game of chicken thats all it is said rep silvio 
conte rmass who was a negotiator from may until top 
congressional leaders took over last week 
to prevent a complete government shutdown the democrats who 
control congress planned to begin working on a bill that would 
temporarily finance the government through oct 20 the date was 
chosen to give budget bargainers a chance to work out a pact and 
enact it into law 
if you get into the business of suspending and suspending and 
suspending well be at it for 114 years said budget director 
richard darman 
the same legislation is expected to provide about 2 billion 
toward the expenses of operation desert shield the us military 
deployment in the middle east 
unless some combination of tax increases and spending cuts are 
found the fiscal 1991 deficit is expected to exceed a record 250 
billion in a budget of about 12 trillion

president mikhail s gorbachev needed sweeping new 
powers to quickly carry out economic reforms not to introduce a 
state of siege his economic adviser said tuesday 
nikolai petrakov fended off charges that gorbachev was amassing 
too much power 
the supreme soviet parliament voted overwhelmingly monday to 
give gorbachev broad authority to order the switch to a market 
economy without consulting legislators every step of the way 
dissenting lawmakers said the special powers would make gorbachev a 
virtual monarch despite his vow to act responsibly 
the resolution permits gorbachev to issue presidential decrees 
for the next 18 months on property wages prices the national 
budget the financial system and law and order 
so why does the president need these extraordinary powers of 
course not for the purpose of introducing a state of siege or 
presidents rule petrakov told a news briefing 
some of the problems will have to be resolved in one two or 
three days and those decisions should be taken instantaneously 
he said it will be difficult to convene the parliament and 
discuss every issue 
the supreme soviet also voted in principle monday to end seven 
decades of inefficient centrally planned economics and take the 
leap toward a westernstyle free market lawmakers were unable 
however to decide which of three conflicting plans they liked 
best 
gorbachev appointed a commission headed by himself to try to 
merge the plans by oct 15 previous attempts have failed the 
commission held its first meeting tuesday 
petrakov expressed surprise at a weekend challenge of 
gorbachevs request for expanded powers by leaders of the russian 
federation the largest and wealthiest of the 15 soviet republics 
russian president boris n yeltsin and other leaders of the 
republics legislature read a statement on the popular vremya 
television news program calling gorbachevs request unacceptable 
yeltsin said it was an attempt to introduce presidential rule in 
the republics and disband their governments 
it was a reaction based on rumor petrakov said tuesday 
seven decades of communiststyle economics have left the soviet 
people short of adequate housing food and consumers goods 
eggs and vegetables are the latest scarcities in moscow 
the egg shortage was blamed on last years campaign against 
salmonella which has lowered egg production without eliminating 
the dangerous bacteria 
the komsomolskaya pravda newspaper said moscow warehouses had 
only 6 percent of the potatoes they expected to store this winter 
and only 13 percent of other vegetables it said there had been 
many reported thefts from personal vegetable cellars 
soviet prime minister nikolai ryzhkov the author of the most 
conservative economic reform program has become a lightning rod 
for public disenchantment and has been fighting demands for his 
resignation 
petrakov asked why gorbachev doesnt fire the beleaguered chief 
minister replied the president is a very resolute and 
independent person and i believe that you should understand that 
there is a certain apprehension regarding the consequences of a 
government crisis

the doorman who decides whether you look cool 
enough to get into a hot nightclub may be about to get his own 
comeuppance under california civil rights law 
the state alcoholic beverage control department and a private 
lawyer in separate actions have accused two fashionable los 
angeles night spots of arbitrary discrimination based on 
appearance the states unruct prohibits any 
arbitrary discrimination by businesses 
its a subjective policy carl falletta the abcs deputy 
division chief in los angeles said monday it depends on who the 
doorman wants to let in 
he said a nigh civil rights ahtclub open to the public can legally 
enforce a 
neutral dress code or a ban on disruptive customers but cant rely 
on a subjective eyeofthebeholder standard like no nerds 
allowed 
the abc is seeking a 30day liquor license suspension of a 
downtown club called vertigo where undercover officers allegedly 
were excluded because of their appearance 
lawyer kenneth lipton excluded from the nearby mayan has sued 
that nightclub in small claims court seeking the 250 damage award 
provided by state law he said other spurned customers should 
besiege the clubs with similar lawsuits and force a change in 
policy 
the people have the power to do this if they would stop 
allowing themselves to be treated conomy was headed toward a recession 
before iraq and 
iraq was just the nail in the coffin said allen sinai chief 
economist for the boston co a recession seems inescapable he 
said 
surveys following iraqs aug 2 invasion of kuwait and the 
subsequent oilprice spiral showed many top economists 
forecasting an imminent recession 
the national association of business economists reported tuesday 
that more than half of the 71 professional forecasters responding 
to its survey in late august and early september said a recession 
already has begun or will begin in the fourth quarter of 1990 or 
the first quarter of 1991 
and half of the top economists surveyed each month by blue chip 
economic indicators now believe the economy will enter a recession 
this year 
in a sharp revision of earlier views 50 percent of the 50 
panel members replying now think the longdelayed recession 
will start this year wrote rj eggert the newsletters editor 
of those expecting the recession to begin this year three 
believe it actually began in the second quarter six expect the 
downturn to begin in the current quarter and 16 have pegged the 
fourth quarter of this year as the starting date 
sinai pointed to negative economic data already available for 
july and august and said it looks like the recession started in 
the third quarter 
the economy ground to a halt in the second quarter and is in 
the process of contracting right now added richard w rahn 
chief economist for the us chamber of commerce 
a price index tied to the gnp was unchanged at an annual rate of 
39 percent in the second quarter but with the surge in oil 
prices inflation as measured in the consumer price index jumped 
08 percent in august alone the higher prices will be reflected in 
the thirdquarter gnp report 
the price of oil before the iraqi invasion was less than 20 a 
barrel it reached a record 38 a barrel on monday 
since oil is used in producing so many consumer goods as well as 
for heating and transportation any price increase not only slashes 
available funds needed to feed economic growth but also feeds 
inflation 
the department originally had estimated the economy grew at a 
12 percent rate from april through june after advances of 17 
percent in the first quarter and 25 percent in 1989 and 45 
percent in 1988 
but it said tuesday that more complete data showed weaker net 
exports and lower inventory accumulation than first thought 
the new data showed net exports declining by 92 billion rather 
than 45 billion and inventories totaling 198 billion rather 
than 224 billion 
but there really were no areas of strength sinai said 
consumer spending which represents twothirds of the nations 
economic activity rose just 02 percent down from 11 percent in 
the first quarter business investment fell 47 percent after a 5 
percent gain from january through march 
housing construction plunged 112 percent after advancing 151 
percent in the first quarter government spending rose 62 percent 
but most of that was by the federal government state and local 
spending was down 06 percent 
if the economy were in a recession generally described as two 
consecutive quarters of negative growth it would end the nearly 
eight years of expansion that began after the 198182 downturn 
the commerce department also reported today that aftertax 
corporate profits fell a revised 06 percent worse than the 02 
percent drop first reported and their poorest showing since a 59 
percent decline in the third quarter of 1989 they had risen 05 
percent in the first quarter and 17 percent in the final quarter 
of 1989 
the various changes left the gnp growing by 45 billion in the 
second quarter after removing the effects of inflation the gnp 
totaled an annual rate of 416 trillion

the chairman of a national bipartisan 
commission said tuesday that its 70 billion plan to guarantee 
universal access to health care is absolutely inevitable 
because of growing public anger over the current health system 
people who predict we cant do this are going to be wrong 
because the american people are going to make us do it said sen 
jay rockefeller dwva 
the panel headed by rockefeller and known as the pepper 
commission after its former chairman released the final report 
of its twoyear study while the basic elements of its proposal 
for overhauling medicaid and the health insurance system were 
decided last spring the panel provided supporting details and 
cited potential tax increases to pay its 70 billion price tag 
the recommendations drew criticism from opposite sides with 
some saying it was unrealistic and too expensive and others saying 
it fell short of a national health insurance solution 
the pepper commission report is a start but needs to be taken 
with a grain of salt said a republican member sen david 
durenberger of minnesota we didnt finish the job of building 
political consensus behind a solution but we did help define the 
problems and narrow the options and that sets the stage for the 
president to make his contribution 
the commissions recommendations were opposed by the bush 
administration which lobbied the commission members to oppose 
them rockefeller said 
the us bipartisan commission on comprehensive health care was 
established out of concern that more than 30 million americans have 
no health insurance and millions more face impoverishment by 
longterm care its first chairman was the late rep claude pepper 
dfla the longtime champion of americas senior citizens 
the commission plan calls for requiring all businesses with more 
than 100 employers to provide private health insurance or 
contribute to a new public plan for all employees and their 
dependents 
smaller employers would be given financial incentives to provide 
their employees coverage if after five years such coverage is 
not widespread those employers would be required to provide 
private insurance or participate in a new federal public health 
insurance plan 
the commission also would improve medicare coverage for the 
elderly and would establish a program to cover longterm care 
services including provisions for care within the home 
all would be guaranteed coverage for the first three months of a 
nursing home stay with extended benefits based on financial need 
people needing longterm care would not be required to spend 
themselves into poverty before receiving federal coverage as 
medicaid requires 
cost of the package was estimated at 24 billion for 
recommendations involving people under age 65 3 billion for 
elderly health care and 43 billion for longterm care when fully 
implemented after five years 
the commission said the 70 billion total amounts to 825 a 
week for every nonpoor adult in the country 
the plans face an uphill struggle in congress and bills to 
fully implement them wont even be ready until next year 
rockefeller is sponsoring with sen orrin hatch rutah a bill 
that would make a first step by extending medicaid to cover all 
lowincome children and pregnant women 
but with the administration and congressional leaders still 
debating ways to lower the budget deficit prospects for any action 
on expanding health care coverage are considered dim still 
rockefeller said the commissions plan or something like it will be 
enacted eventually 
it is absolutely inevitable rockefeller said before the 
end of this century well before the pepper commission or a plan 
similar to that will be the health care system of this country 
the commissions initial recommendations drew fire for failing 
to include recommendations for how to pay for it 
the commission made no financing recommendations but its final 
report includes six potential finance packages as possibilities 
key elements of include an increase in the top income tax rates a 
surcharge on all federal income taxes imposing a new valueadded 
tax and increasing social security taxes 
the report includes dissenting views from members including 
rep pete stark chairman of the house ways and means subcommittee 
on health he said a jobbased plan will not provide coverage to 
all americans and that the pepper commission failed to include 
realistic health cost containment proposals 
a single national plan is the only realistic way to make 
health insurance affordable to small employers said stark 
dcalif who has sponsored his own universal health care bill 
rep bill gradison rohio also on the commission pronounced 
the recommendations so costly that they are unrealistic

president bush vowing anew that iraqs 
conquest of kuwait will not stand today promised increased 
trade with turkey to help it economically weather the international 
embargo against iraq 
meanwhile a pentagon spokesman said iraq has increased the 
number of troops and tanks in kuwait and southern iraq over the 
past week about 430000 iraqi soldiers are now in southern iraq 
and occupied kuwait said spokesman pete williams an increase from 
the 360000 total reported last week 
bush met at the white house with turkish president turgot ozal 
and separately with portugese prime minister cavaco silva both 
leaders voiced strong support for the usled effort to isolate 
saddam hussein 
the president praised staunch allies like turkey for joining 
in telling the world we will not tolerate this invasion it will 
not stand 
in a brief white house ceremony after his meeting with ozal 
bush said the united states would seek a new agreement to increase 
textile imports from turkey 
he also pledged to work closely with congress to make sure 
that turkey gets its fair share of military aid in the coming 
year we will also work to help modernize the turkish armed 
forces by the future sales of f16s and provision of other military 
equipment bush said 
we stand by those who stand up for civilized values around the 
world bush said 
for his part ozal praised bush for his firm stand against 
aggression 
turkey was one of the first nations to help the united states 
after the aug 2 iraqi invasion of kuwait by closing a major 
pipeline carrying iraqi oil portugal is allowing us airlift 
flights to saudi arabia to use an airbase in the azores for 
refueling 
silva speaking with reporters after his meeting with the 
president said the international community must stick together 
and be very firm in enforcing the united nations sanctions 
against iraq 
nobody can accept that such a brutal aggression will pay 
off he said 
ozal who had lunch with bush told reporters at a 
picturetaking session in the oval office that were going to 
talk now about prospects for more aid to his battered economy 
asked how long turkey could hold out without trade with iraq or 
with oilrelated revenues ozal said as much as it requires 
at the pentagon williams said the iraqi deployments still 
appear to be essentially a defensive force but are capable of 
readily converting to an offensive strike force 
he said the reported increases in iraqi troops and tank 
deployments are due in part to the pentagon including a larger 
geographic area in its count williams said he could not estimate 
how much of the increase was due to this factor he said some of 
the extra soldiers had been moved from the iranian border area 
the number of tanks in the kuwait theater has jumped by 700 from 
last week to 3500 tanks williams said he said the number of 
armored personnel carriers has risen to 2500 an increase of 700 
artillery pieces now total about 1700 up by 250 
us officials said in advance of todays meeting that the 
administration was not prepared to provide any additional direct 
assistance to turkey or other troubled economies in the middle 
east 
the turkish government put its economic cost at 4 billion or 
more annually including millions of dollars in construction 
contracts about 6000 turkish workers have lost jobs as a result 
of the pipeline closure the government says 
bush was prepared to tell the 152member international monetary 
fund later today and its sister lending organization the world 
bank that the two organizations should take a more active role in 
the middle east crisis administration aides said 
white house spokesman marlin fitzwater said bush would ask the 
international agencies to match political leadership shown by the 
united nations with economic leadership in helping ease the shock 
to poor nations of the iraqi embargo 
world bank president barber conable outlined today emergency 
plans to help resettle hundreds of thousands of refugees fleeing 
iraq and kuwait 
on monday bush told a group of arabamerican business leaders 
at the white house there will be no no no negotiation with 
iraq until it fully withdraws from kuwait 
he encountered some sharp questioning after he finished prepared 
remarks to about 150 representatives of arabamerican groups 
including one from a participant who told him that as moslems we 
object to saudi arabia inviting the foreign troops to our land 
the objective is to see that naked aggression does not pay 
off sir bush replied 
asked by another participant why he would not talk directly with 
saddam the president said the united states would not negotiate 
until iraq pulled out of kuwait the former kuwaiti leadership was 
restored and the safety of americans was assured 
were not going to yield one inch on those provisions he 
said 
bush also said i am not going to be distracted by saddams 
suggestions that the atmosphere for a settlement would be improved 
if israel withdrew from occupied territories 
we are going to resist his attempts to justify what he did 
based on other regional concerns so i think these are merely on 
his part an effort to create additional pretexts so that he can 
stay in kuwait bush said 
asked why the united states was depriving the children of iraq 
of food in the international trade embargo the president said the 
iraqi government would not permit relief organizations to send in 
supervised food shipments 
i am much less interested in feeding saddam husseins army at 
this point he said

nasa said tuesday it will try to 
launch the shuttle discovery with a sunprobing satellite on oct 
6 while the search goes on for mysterious hydrogen leaks that have 
grounded columbia 
discovery is scheduled to lift off at 735 am with five 
astronauts who will send the european satellite on a fiveyear 
journey to study the suns polar regions it would be the first 
spacecraft to orbit the solar poles 
this date is a little successoriented and is dependent on not 
encountering any unusual problems said shuttle director robert 
crippen but i think the shuttle team has a good chance of making 
the 6th 
nasas last shuttle flight was in april when discovery carried 
the flawed hubble space telescope into orbit soon afterward the 
rest of the fleet columbia and atlantis were crippled by hydrogen 
leaks 
columbia is not expected to fly until late this year or early 
next year nasas fourth attempt in as many months to send columbia 
on an astronomy mission failed last week 
atlantis has been in the hangar since early august undergoing 
repairs for leaks in hydrogen lines between the orbiter and its 
external tank its classified pentagon mission originally 
scheduled for july is now set for early november 
nasa officials repeatedly have said they are confident 
discoverys fuel lines are leakfree because of the shuttles 
flight performance in april and the minimal amount of work 
performed since then in its engine compartment 
nasa faces an oct 23 launch deadline for discovery and the 
plutoniumpowered sun probe named for the legendary greek 
adventurer ulysses if discovery does not lift off by then the 
mission will have to wait until the planets are properly aligned 
again in late 1991 
to enter an orbit passing over the suns poles ulysses must 
travel to jupiter a 16month trip and use that planets gravity 
to throw it back toward the sun ulysses is expected to pass over 
the suns south pole in 1994 and the north pole the following year 
the white house on monday approved discoverys launch with 
ulysses such approval is necessary when radioisotope 
thermoelectric generators or rtgs are used 
ulysses one rtg will convert heat from 24 pounds of decaying 
plutonium into electricity antinuclear activists and 
environmentalists oppose the generators use saying a 
challengerlike accident would spread the deadly plutonium over 
florida 
but officials of the national aeronautics and space 
administration contend the health risk would be small even in the 
worst circumstance 
the 750 million mission initially was scheduled for may 1986 
but was delayed by the challenger explosion earlier that year

president bush urged the senate tuesday to 
swiftly approve a historic treaty to end the division of germany 
45 years after the defeat of the nazis 
at a ceremony in the rose garden bush called the agreement 
the culmination of more than four decades of western resolve and 
determination from the darkest hours of the cold war to the bright 
new horizons that stretch before us 
the accord formally relinquishes all rights and responsibilities 
over germany by the four victorious allies in world war ii it was 
signed in moscow on sept 12 by officials from the united states 
soviet union britain and france 
the treaty must be ratified by the four allied powers before 
their rights in germany are formally terminated however the four 
countries have agreed to suspend their rights on oct 1 two 
days before the merger of east and west germany 
in the transmittal letter to the senate bush said it is 
wholly fitting that germany formally and irrevocably achieve its 
unified status at the earliest possible moment unfettered by 
fourpower rights shared by the soviet union which are now 
outmoded and unnecessary 
he said the treaty represents a major achievement for our 
german allies who have not forgotten the past or the role germany 
once played in the horrors of 193345 but who have demonstrated 
over four decades of steadfast support for democracy and the 
western alliance what the world can expect from the united 
germany 
after the defeat of the nazis the four allies divided germany 
and its capital into four occupation zones which became east and 
west germany and east and west berlin 
aside from ending the division of the country the treaty calls 
on the soviet union to complete the withdrawal of its estimated 
370000 troops from what is now east germany by 1994 
us british and french troops will remain in berlin during the 
interim 
in his remarks bush said the treaty will end the artificial 
division of germany and berlin and it will restore to germany 
sovereignty over all its territory and end all remaining fourpower 
rights and responsibilities 
this agreement clears the way to achievement of the goal we 
americans have long shared with the german people a united 
democratic and sovereign germany the president said 
he congratulated west german chancellor helmut kohl and the 
german people for keeping their dream of national 
selfdetermination ever alive

south african president f w de klerk said 
today he believes the economic sanctions imposed by the united 
states against his country slowed down the reform process that he 
has instituted 
de klerk speaking to a press luncheon as he neared the end of 
his official visit here said his government nonetheless plans to 
carry out all of the reforms the sanctions were designed to 
promote 
asked about the impact of the sanctions legislation de klerk 
said to a great extent it was counterproductive 
people under threat tend to react negatively we dont like as 
a country to be prescribed to by other countries and theres an 
emotional reaction which is brought about by that 
among other measures the sanctions approved in 1986 over 
president reagans veto forbid new us investment in south africa 
and deny south african air carriers landing rights in the united 
states 
de klerk spoke to reporters at a national press club luncheon 
after conferring with senate leaders since his arrival here 
sunday de klerk has sought to convince americans that he is 
serious about his commitment to establish a nonracial system in 
his country but some black activists remain skeptical 
the 24member congressional black caucus canceled a meeting it 
had scheduled with de klerk because it feared the session could be 
misinterpreted 
after de klerks meeting monday with president bush randall 
robinson head of the transafrica antiapartheid group said the 
two leaders meeting sent a false and dangerous message that 
south africa is on its way to change 
de klerk meanwhile assured bush that the process of democratic 
reform cannot be reversed 
we will not turn back he said promising a new system in 
which all south africans will have a vote of equal value 
bush in turn hailed the dramatic progress away from 
apartheid rule in south africa 
clearly the time has come to encourage and assist the 
emerging new south africa bush said after his 2 hour session 
with de klerk 
behind the leaders a black marine held the flag of south africa 
and a white marine held the american flag 
it was just a year ago that de klerk assumed the south african 
presidency a time when ussouth african relations were still 
frosty because of the negligible progress toward ending white rule 
bush remarked on how far south africa has come under de klerks 
tutelage 
who among us only a year ago would have anticipated these 
remarkable developments bush said 
de klerk has overseen the lifting of bans on democratic 
political parties and the release of african national congress 
leader nelson mandela among other prisoners 
still south africa has not met the requirements for lifting 
us economic sanctions which were imposed by congress four years 
ago over president reagans veto 
us officials said south africa still must lift emergency rule 
in natal province and release the remaining political prisoners 
before the sanctions may be suspended 
later foreign minister pik botha said bushs characterization 
of the dismantling of apartheid as irreversible should help 
persuade european governments to lift sanctions he said he 
understood the difficulty in changing us sanctions written into 
law by congress 
we are aware of the sensitivities constraining the us 
administration and we are not here to ask the us to do anything 
about it at this stage botha said 
the congressional black caucus remains skeptical about de 
klerks promises rep ron dellums dcalif caucus chairman 
explained the decision not to meet with de klerk saying to meet 
with the caucus separate and apart bestows a level of credibility 
that at this point we are not prepared to deal with 
but dellums and other black members of the house were to be 
among the lawmakers meeting with de klerk this afternoon

the soviets stumbling transition to a free 
economy is unleashing a wave of economic crime and the black 
market is thriving on the sale of scarce goods senior police 
officials said tuesday 
investigators have found corruption at half of the 160000 
businesses they have inspected so far this year and cases of 
serious embezzlement are running at twice last years rate col 
vyacheslav i runyshkov of the ministry of internal affairs told a 
news conference 
the release of such alarming statistics on black marketeering 
indicated that law enforcement officials are concerned about social 
and economic problems stemming from the zigzag path to reform 
for a year the soviet government and legislature have been on 
the verge of moving from a planned to a market economy but have 
balked repeatedly throwing the system into chaos 
severe shortages of consumer goods such as bread and tobacco 
not only have caused widespread dissatisfaction but have fueled 
the already extensive black market 
the disappearance of goods between factories and stateowned 
retail outlets means the system will be able to provide only 32 
percent of the national requirements for medicine but purchases 
abroad could raise that figure to 68 percent said runyshkov who 
is in charge of the nations chief anticorruption unit 
he cited similar shortages of vegetables potatoes grain and 
other staples 
runyshkov strongly denied the shortages were caused either by a 
conspiracy among hardline communist party opponents of reform or 
by an organized crime network 
it is often said that this is a result of the actions of some 
destructive forces or the mafia he said i declare that 
neither the ministry of internal affairs nor the kgb have 
established this 
what is at hand is just negligence he said describing case 
after case in which workers diverted goods from state enterprises 
and sold them illegally 
asked to provide more specific reasons for the disappearance of 
bread or vegetables runyshkov and five other police officials 
laughed nervously and replied we dont understand it 
the phenomenon they described was one of many small and 
mediumsized thefts in which the goods turn up for sale in private 
shops called cooperatives or on the black market 
the chaos that has surrounded economic reform led the national 
legislature on monday to grant president mikhail s gorbachev broad 
powers to steer the country from a planned to a market system 
without consulting lawmakers every step of the way 
the resolution allows gorbachev to issue presidential decrees 
for the next 18 months on property wages prices the national 
budget the financial system and law and order 
the surge in economic crime indicates that the state 
distribution system appears to be disintegrating 
black market prices run two to three times those in state stores 
for most goods and three to five times for automobiles runyshkov 
said 
on sept 20 he said 650 stateowned butcher shops did not have 
meat 799 did not have sausage 1069 dairy shops had no eggs and 
1803 grocery stores had no sugar he did not cite the number of 
stores overall for comparison 
runyshkov said the number of people tried on major embezzlement 
charges doubled from last year to this year but he did not say 
specifically how many people were involved the number of people 
tried for economic crimes of all types was 188000 in the first

soviet military spending fell last year for 
the first time since president mikahil gorbachev came to power in 
1985 reflecting the impact of a domestic economic crisis and new 
thinking in the kremlin the pentagon said tuesday 
the defense department also said in its annual assessment of 
soviet military strength that moscow slowed the pace of arms 
production last year particularly of tanks artillery pieces and 
other equipment for its ground forces 
the report the ninth in a series started by thendefense 
secretary caspar weinberger departed from previous editions by 
striking an encouraging tone in describing the security threat to 
the west posed by the soviet military 
the likelihood of a conflict stemming from ussoviet 
confrontation is lower than it has ever been in the postwar era 
the report said noting the historic changes of the last year 
including the breakup of the soviet empire in eastern europe 
prior to the advent of new thinking soviet military 
policies sought to build and maintain forces capable of defeating 
the combined forces of all potential adversaries it said 
the soviets now set less ambitious goals 
in an introductory essay defense secretary dick cheney said he 
was encouraged by signs of soviet eagerness to cooperate with the 
west but he added that domestic political and economic turmoil 
made it difficult to be sure of soviet intentions 
in such an atmosphere it is difficult to predict what will 
happen next month let alone next year cheney wrote adding a 
note of caution 
the soviet union remains an enormous military superpower the 
intentions of that regime are changing but intentions are not 
enough to support dramatic changes in our level of preparedness 
the report said soviet defense spending last year fell by 4 
percent to 5 percent from the 1988 level pete williams a pentagon 
spokesman said that in the period from 1985 when gorbachev 
assumed power as general secretary of the soviet communist party 
to 1988 soviet military spending rose by an annual average of 3 
percent 
us defense spending since 1985 has declined by an annual 
average of about 2 percent and is headed for a bigger drop as a 
resulf of current negotiations between the white house and congress 
over the 1991 budget year which starts monday 
gorbachev announced in january 1989 that he intended to cut 
defense spending by 142 percent by 1991 
the pentagon report said the most pronounced reductions in 
soviet arms production in 1989 came in ground forces materiel 
moscow built about 1700 tanks last year half the previous years 
total production of artillery pieces fell by nearly 20 percent and 
multiplerocket launchers dropped to 300 from 480 
cheney stressed that while gorbachev was reducing arms 
production in most areas he was maintaining soviet strength in 
strategic or longrange nuclear forces 
the soviets for example are modernizing their arsenal of 
intercontinental ballistic missiles including continued deployment 
of the ss24 a multiplewarhead missile the mobile ss25 and a 
new version of the ss18 which carries 10 warheads 
the pentagon report said that domestic crises including 
nationalist movements and economic turmoil pose grave dangers to 
the stability of the soviet union and thus made it impossible to 
be sure if military reforms will be lasting 
domestic crises are bringing the soviet union to the brink 
of economic breakdown and potential internal chaos the report 
said as a result the soviets are developing a policy and 
strategy that is oriented toward defense of the ussr and away from 
external adventurism 
in a departure from past practice cheney did not personally 
present the pentagon report at a news conference his spokesman 
pete williams said cheneys decision reflected in part us 
appreciation of soviet cooperation in the multinational effort to 
force iraq a former soviet arms customer out of kuwait

male homosexuals have started carrying guns 
when they go to bars since they heard rumors that a murderer may be 
stalking them 
at least six of my friends are carrying guns now too 
richard todd said recently in our place a gay bar 
in the past decade the bodies of 11 slain young men in their 
teens and 20s have been found dumped in remote areas of central 
indiana and western ohio all were nude or partially clothed seven 
were strangled and the causes of death of four were not determined 
the first 10 had ties to the indianapolis homosexual community 
investigators say it is not known if the latest victim found 
sept 12 in darke county ohio had ties to that community said 
larry swihart a preble county ohio sheriffs investigator 
authorities believe the slayings may be the work of one person 
although they stop short of calling the deaths serial killings 
david morse manager of our place said he and others believe 
the killer is a gay man who believes he is heterosexual 
he experiences sexual urges and acts impulsively upon them 
then feels guilty and afraid because of it morse said its 
very hard to come to terms with homosexuality because there is so 
much discrimination against it 
morse added whoever is killing these people has a good 
knowledge of the gay community he knows where to go to find his 
victims 
todd says he and other gay men have changed their lifestyles 
since the slayings were linked 
you cant have onenight stands if it is a onenight stand 
then you are chancing dying he said 
but morse said the community is not afraid just more cautious 
he has asked employees to keep an eye out for strangers and plans 
to post newspaper articles about the slayings 
were encouraging them to read the articles and to know the 
people they meet he said 
i know people pick up the paper and say this wont happen to 
me said david roettger whose son was one of the victims 
well not everything happens to somebody else 
investigators say they are no closer to finding a suspect 
we have no answers said darke county ohio sheriff robert 
sullenbarger we dont even know where the homicides occurred 
now we pray for a little luck

pope john paul ii issued rules for the 
worlds catholic universities tuesday a compromise document that 
instructed schools to uphold official doctrine but dropped 
proposals to give bishops wide powers 
the longawaited document pleased many us catholic educators 
who had protested earlier drafts that would have given bishops a 
say in hiring and firing of theology teachers the final document 
assigns bishops a watchdog role in protecting the universities 
catholic identity 
american officials were surprised however by the popes 
stipulation that a majority of a universitys teachers be catholic 
a decree vatican officials acknowledged will be difficult to 
carry out in certain countries 
archbishop pio laghi head of the vaticans congregation for 
catholic education said finding a catholicmajority faculty in 
nations like japan and indonesia might be impossible 
this should be considered a principle something that should 
be put into effect as much as we can he said 
the 49page document drawn up over 10 years and issued in the 
form of a constitution upheld the right ff academic freedom and 
independence but it also stressed that students and teachers 
particularly theologians must not stray from official church 
teaching 
all catholic teachers are to be faithful to and all other 
teachers are to respect catholic doctrine and morals in their 
research and teaching it said 
american catholic educators had complained that earlier drafts 
threatened to undermine academic freedom and give the church 
hierarchy too much control 
the united states with 235 catholic institutes of higher 
learning has the worlds largest catholic university system 
sister alice gallin of washington dc executive director of 
the association of catholic colleges and universities said she did 
not believe the us system would have to make major changes to 
comply with the churchs new policy 
the document says the constitution will go into effect at the 
start of the 1991 academic year and applies to all 935 catholic 
universities and institutes throughout the world 
four years ago the presidents of 110 us catholic institutions 
said imposition of the vaticans original proposals could force 
some of the nations schools to close drive theologians away and 
cost the colleges federal and state student aid 
the final document says the local bishop has a responsibility 
to promote the welfare of the catholic universities in his diocese 
and has the right and duty to watch over the preservation and 
strengthening of their catholic character 
the document said relations between universities and bishops 
should be marked by mutual trust close and consistent 
cooperation and continuing dialogue 
that statement in itself would not disturb anybody here 
said the rev joseph a ohare president of fordham university in 
new york and part of a us delegation that conferred with vatican 
officials in april 1989 
the church recognizes freedom of research and teaching in each 
discipline it says but stresses that this must be in accordance 
with its own principles and proper methods 
the document singled out the role of theologians saying they 
must respect the authority of the bishops and assent to catholic 
doctrine 
during john pauls papacy several theologians have been 
punished for straying from church teaching on sexual and other 
issues they include the rev charles e curran barred from 
teaching at catholic university of america in washington in 1987 
three months ago the vatican issued a document ruling out 
public dissent by theologians telling them to uphold church 
doctrine or keep quiet

the city council unable to override a 
mayoral veto of its proposed tax on college students tuition has 
decided to look at other ways of increasing revenue from 
northwestern university 
council members voted 108 monday in favor of overriding mayor 
joan barrs veto twelve votes were needed 
but the council did establish a threemember committee to look 
for other ways to increase the revenue northwestern brings into the 
city 
officials said that if approved the tuition tax would have been 
the first in the nation 
supporters of the tax said it would have offset revenue lost 
because northwesterns 242 acres are not subject to property taxes 
school officials complained the tax would hurt students 
the measure called for most students at northwestern and three 
other colleges in the chicago suburb of 73000 to pay about 45 
annually 
alderman jack korshak said the measure would have generated more 
than 500000 a year

sandinista peasants and demobilized 
contra rebels fought over land in remote northern nicaragua and 
seven people were killed a newspaper reported tuesday 
it was the latest in a series of violent incidents in the 
hinterland involving landhungry peasants from the two sides and 
comes amid increasing tensions elsewhere in the country 
striking workers at the main government bus depot in managua 
burned tires tuesday and said they would not allow the vehicles to 
leave the yard 
the strikers who oppose privatizing public transport and are 
demanding higher pay took over the facility sept 17 and since 
then have been ousted twice by police 
on tuesday morning they remained outside the locked gates of 
the yard and citizens were forced to use private buses and pickup 
trucks to get to work 
the leftist sandinista front and its powerful labor unions 
announced a march by teachers wednesday to kick off a civic protest 
that is to culminate next monday with a nationwide strike 
on wednesday president violeta barrios de chamorro is scheduled 
to leave for new york where she is to speak at the united nations 
barricada official newspaper of the sandinista front said in a 
frontpage story that seven people were killed and four were 
wounded when a group of demobilized rebels tried to take over a 
sandinista cooperative farm called la dalia 
the farm is near san juan de rio coco a village 150 miles 
northeast of managua in the mountains near the honduran border 
official confirmation of the incident which barricada said 
occurred monday afternoon was not immediately available 
spokesmen for the interior ministry in charge of rural police 
and the sandinista peoples army were in a meeting and not 
immediately available for comment their offices said 
according to barricada the former contra rebels are in control 
of the narrow dirt roads leading into the zone and have erected 
roadblocks where passing vehicles are checked 
agrarian reform minister gustavo tabladas deputy nemesio 
porras said tablada was out of the country but did not say where 
tabladas ministry is in charge of more than 3000 agriculture 
cooperatives established during the 10 years of sandinista rule and 
of distributing land to nearly 20000 rebels who laid down their 
weapons earlier this year and returned to civilian life 
most of the former contras are peasants and many had their lands 
confiscated by the sandinistas when they took up arms against the 
leftist regime who lost feb 25 elections to mrs chamorro 
government officials say they have distributed as much land as 
they can to the former guerrillas who say they want more land 
because much of what has been given them is unusable 
mrs chamorros government has met with strong sandinista 
opposition in its attempts to rescue nicaraguas economy 
among measures announced by the government is the planned firing 
of 25000 civil servants starting oct 1 and the privatization of 
hundreds of enterprises confiscated by the sandinistas 
the sandinistas have vowed not to allow that to happen and plan 
staggered strikes nationwide beginning with teachers on wednesday

alexander solzhenitsyns proposal to replace the 
soviet union with an allslavic state is destructive and 
disrespectful to the countrys other ethnic groups president 
mikhail s gorbachev said tuesday 
solzhenitsyn the nobel prizewinning author who was expelled 
from the soviet union for treason in 1974 made his proposal in an 
article published a week ago by two soviet newspapers 
in his first public comment on the article gorbachev told the 
national legislature that solzhenitsyn was an undoubtedly great 
man but his views on the future of our multinational state are 
unacceptable 
gorbachev cast himself as a politician dedicated to preserving 
the soviet union as a multiethnic country 
several lawmakers also attacked solzhenitsyn and none supported 
him or came to his defense 
solzhenitsyn believes russia has a unique heritage and destiny 
and he condemns soviet efforts to bind dozens of disparate cultures 
into a single nation 
solzhenitsyn 71 wrote his rambling philosophical article 
titled how we can make russia comfortable at his home in 
cavendish vt it was published sept 18 by the reformist newspaper 
komsomolskaya pravda and a day later by the literary weekly 
literaturnaya gazeta 
the newspapers have a combined circulation of 265 million and 
the article was an immediate sensation throughout the country 
discussed on moscow streets read by lawmakers and mentioned on the 
nightly tv news 
but until gorbachev was asked by a lawmaker to comment on the 
article tuesday there was no public reaction from a top government 
official 
the article which took up the equivalent of four full newspaper 
pages said communism had taken a flourishing country and turned it 
back into a halfsavage state 
but it also expressed disdain for western popmass culture 
and urged russia not to follow the west blindly 
solzhenitsyn urged a populist revival from below saying 
that russias villages and rural areas should be the starting point 
for the creation of democracy and a healthy economy 
he also advocated the breakup of collective farms called for 
free enterprise and warned against a political system in which 
parties compete for power every party tries to do its best not 
for the whole nation but for itself and its own members he 
wrote 
gorbachev focused on just one of solzhenitsyns many 
suggestions that russia byelorussia the ukraine and much of 
kazakhstan which are inhabited primarily by people of slavic 
extraction should form a single nation and let the other 11 soviet 
republics secede 
the article and the authors personality demand a very srious 
analysis gorbachev said i am seized by very contradictory 
feelings as a russian i fully share concern for the destiny 
of the russian people and russia 
but at the same time as a russian i definitely cannot agree 
with solzhenitsyns attitude toward other ethnic groups even by 
the most generous appraisal it is a disrespectful stand i cannot 
agree with it 
gorbachev added that solzhenitsyn was living entirely in the 
past the past russia the czarist monarchy 
the writers views are far from reality and have a 
destructive character he said 
gorbachevs remarks came as the national legislature began 
debate on how to negotiate a new union treaty with the 15 soviet 
republics gorbachev said he wants a union of sovereign states 
in which every ethnic group feels good and realizes its 
potential 
among the lawmakers who criticized solzhenitsyn was boris 
oleinik deputy chairman of the legislatures council of 
nationalities who said the writers views belittle the national 
dignity of many ethnic groups and could lead to separatism 
yurii shcherbak a lawmaker from the ukraine said 
solzhenitsyns proposals were underlined by messianic 
neomonarchist ideas of great power chauvinism 
the lawmaker who asked for gorbachevs comments was erkegali 
rakhmadiev of kazakhstan who objected to solzhenitsyns appeal for 
russians to take control of some kazakh lands he said in an 
interview later that the writers proposal was a hitlerite 
fascistic approach 
even delegates from republics that are seeking independence from 
the soviet union such as lithuania latvia estonia and georgia 
did not try to defend solzhenitsyn 
one bit of support for solzhenitsyn came tuesday from ryazan 
the city 100 miles southeast of moscow where solzhenitsyn wrote his 
books one day in the life of ivan denisovich and the cancer 
ward the city council officially gave him the freedom of 
ryazan an honor much like receiving the key to a city 
solzhenitsyns works describe life in soviet labor camps and 
were banned in the soviet union from the mid1960s until after 
gorbachev came to power in 1985 his books including the gulag 
archipelago are now being published but are still not widely 
available 
gorbachev restored the writers citizenship last month but 
solzhenitsyn has expressed reluctance about returning

syrian president hafez assad left tehran 
on tuesday after a fourday visit and sources said he failed to 
win a pledge from his iranian allies not to send food and other 
essentials to iraq 
sources close to the syrian delegation quoted assad as saying 
tehran did promise not to buy embargoed iraqi oil or to help 
baghdad export its crude through iranian pipelines 
iran has said it will enforce sanctions on neighboring iraq 
imposed by the united nations after saddam husseins aug 2 
invasion of kuwait 
the united states has formed a new alliance with syria since 
iraq invaded kuwait on aug 2 assad who met earlier this month in 
damascus with secretary of state james a baker iii is believed to 
have gone to tehran at washingtons behest to gauge the seriousness 
of irans suggestions it would send essentials to iraq 
but the sources speaking on condition of anonymity said 
washingtons main concern was whether the iranians intended to help 
iraq export oil its main source of revenue through their 
pipelines 
in his meetings with assad iranian president hashemi rafsanjani 
insisted that food supplies to iraq irans foe in the 198088 
persian gulf war did not violate those sanctions because 
humanitarian shipments are permitted the sources said 
assad has sent 4000 commandos to join the usled 
multinational force in saudi arabia and has pledged to send an 
armored division as well 
saddam internationally isolated and squeezed by the embargo 
suddenly made peace with iran last month ending two years of 
deadlocked peace talks 
the islamic republic news agency reported sunday that iranian 
authorities had arrested 29 smugglers trying to move foodstuffs 
across the border into iraq the first report of iran taking steps 
to enforce the sanctions 
the sources said assad carried a message to rafsanjani from 
saudi arabias king fahd calling for an improvement in the 
strained relations between the moslem rivals if tehran blocked 
supplies to iraq and sent troops to join the multinational force 
confronting saddam 
iran rejected the saudi conditions the sources said 
the saudi foreign minister prince saud alfaisal flew to 
damascus shortly before assad to get a firsthand account of the 
talks in tehran arab diplomats said 
rafsanjani leader of the countrys socalled pragmatists is 
eager to rebuild bridges with the west and is believed to favor 
abiding by the sanctions 
but he is under pressure from his powerful vehemently 
antiamerican radical rivals who want iran to help iraq confront 
the great satan 
the iranians have condemned the iraqi invasion but they have 
also criticized fahd for allowing nonmoseem western forces into

bolivia on tuesday gave its indians 
control of vast tracts of troical rain forest and moved to limit 
exploitation by logging companies 
i have the feeling we are writing one of the most beautiful 
and clean pages in the contemporary history of bolivia president 
jaime paz zamora said monday night during a meeting with leaders of 
bolivias lowland indian community 
the measures were enacted after 800 indians from the lowland 
rain forests made a 35day march across the andes to the capital 
la paz to bring attention to the destruction of their environment 
the destruction of south americas tropical rain forests has 
become a major international concern because of the loss of 
irreplaceable species of plants and animals and because it may 
contribute to global warming 
under the new law 19 million acres of land in the beni 
tropical lowlands will be under the control of chimane indians 
two logging companies with operations in the area will be able 
to take wood from the forests only until dec 31 after that they 
will be allowed to bid for logging in new areas under 
governmentestablished ecological guidelines 
four other logging companies that have contracts for another 
year will be able to continue with operations the government says 
but once the contracts expire new concessions will not be granted 
on the lands whose control was ceded over the indians 
bolivias lumber companies and some other business leaders 
warned that limiting logging concessions would hurt foreign 
investment in the country 
logging companies mainly harvest mahogony trees most of the 
wood bound for the lucrative export market bolivia exported 40 
million worth of fine woods in 1989 the government says 
we are returning to our homes with dignity and with the 
knowledge that we have recovered our territories said indian 
leader ernesto noe we have managed to have doors opened to us 
and that our proposals be heard 
the group of indians including women and children marched 470 
miles from the city of trinidad to la paz which is 13000 feet 
above sea level 
at least 150000 indians live in the tropical rain forests 
northeast of la paz twothirds of bolivia is made up of tropical 
lowlands the indians are mainly nomadic hunters fishermen or work 
as hired hands at cattle ranches

smokers who quit can attain within 10 to 15 
years nearly the same chance for a long life as those who never 
smoked at all according to surgeon general antonia c novello 
her first report on smoking the 21st by a surgeon general 
since 1964 said 50 million americans continue the tobacco habit 
though nearly half of all living adults who ever tried it have 
quit it said 390000 die each year from diseases attributed to 
smoking 
the earlier one quits the greater the benefits novello 
said but even people who quit smoking at older ages can expect 
to enjoy a longer and healthier life compared with those who 
continue to smoke 
her report echoed many of the findings of her predecessors but 
it was the first to stress the benefits of quitting rather than 
the risks posed to those who ignore the medical warnings about 
tobacco 
for example it emphasized that people who quit before age 50 
have half the risk of dying in the next 165 years compared with 
continuing smokers and for all age groups it said 10 to 15 years 
of abstinence can improve an exsmokers outlook for life to nearly 
the level of those who never smoked 
novellos report is based largely on previously unpublished data 
from an american cancer society study 
because the health benefits of quitting are so great health 
insurance plans routinely should cover smoking cessation programs 
said dr william roper director of the federal centers for disease 
control in atlanta 
states also should add that benefit to their medicaid programs 
he said federal officials are considering whether to add the 
coverage to medicare which provides health care for the elderly 
and disabled but congressional action would probably also be 
necessary to accomplish that he said 
officials did not have cost estimates for adding coverage of 
smoking cessation to health plans however they said 90 percent of 
people who quit smoking do so on their own without the aid of a 
program 
among other findings of the novello report 
men with a packaday habit are 27 times more likely than 
nonsmokers to die of lung cancer the nations leading cause of 
cancer death women who smoke at this rate have 16 times the risk 
of nonsmokers 
quitting smoking steadily reduces the lung cancer risk after a 
decade of abstinence exsmokers have 30 percent to 50 percent the 
risk of dying of lung cancer as continuing smokers the risk 
continues to decline as the period of abstinence lengthens 
quitting also reduces the risk of cancers of the larynx mouth 
esophagus pancreas and bladder 
smoking during pregnancy doubles the risk of having a 
lowbirthweight baby about 25 percent of pregnant women smoke 
those who quit after three to four months of pregnancy can reduce 
the risk to the child but simply cutting back without quitting 
appears to have little or no benefit 
smokers are twice as likely to die of heart disease the 
leading cause of death as nonsmokers they can cut the excess risk 
in half after only a year of not smoking the report said the risk 
keeps declining with future years of abstinence 
quitting also reduces risk of dying from stroke chronic 
obstructive pulmonary disease influenza pneumonia peripheral 
artery occlusive disease and aortic aneurysm 
additionally quitting smoking lowers the risk of developing 
gastric or duodenal ulcers the report said 
the average weight gain by smokers when they quit is five 
pounds but this poses very little health risk the report said 
less than 4 percent who quit gain more than 20 pounds it said 
the extent to which quitting the habit will improve health and 
reverse the health damages caused by smoking depends on how long 
and how much someone has smoked the report noted 
but even smokers who have already have developed smokingrelated 
disease or symptoms can benefit from quitting it said studies 
have found that cancer patients who quit smoking lower their risk 
of getting a second primary cancer

the onetime chief of staff to former gov jerry 
brown has been sentenced to 46 months in prison for conspiring to 
launder 300000 that an undercover fbi agent told him was 
colombian drug money 
us district judge j lawrence irving on monday also fined 
richard silberman 5500 and said he would decide by next week 
whether to raise that to the maximum 75000 
silberman was arrested at a san diego hotel in april 1989 
prosecutors said he was attempting to negotiate a 11 million 
money laundering deal with fbi agent peter ahearn whom silberman 
thought was an associate of colombian cocaine traffickers 
silberman apologized before his sentencing for the hurt and 
the pain he caused his wife san diego county supervisor susan 
golding and other family members 
i accept full responsibility for what i did and it wont 
happen again he told irving 
silberman 61 was browns chief of staff in the 1970s and an 
influential democratic party fundraiser for years the former 
financier also served on several state commissions and donated 
money to many nonprofit groups in san diego 
it is clear to me that you have achieved more than most men 
could ever dream of your contributions to this community have been 
significant irving told him during sentencing 
what boggles my mind is that you chose to become part of 
the chain that brought poison into the community that you had 
supported for years 
silberman was accused of masterminding the laundering of 
300000 in purported drug profits during the fbi scam 
a jury convicted him in june of structuring a financial 
transaction to avoid federal currency laws but deadlocked on six 
other counts including conspiracy 
he pleaded guilty aug 24 to the single conspiracy count in 
exchange for the dropping of the other charges 
authorities say chris petti a reputed mobster introduced 
silberman to ahearn through robert benjamin a longtime 
acquaintance of pettis who was working secretly as a government 
informant petti faces trial oct 3 
in his plea bargain silberman admitted exchanging 100000 for 
shares of yuba american gold ltd stock for ahearn in november 
1988 the company was a financially strapped northern california 
goldmining venture silberman headed at the time 
ahearn and silberman conducted a 200000 transaction three 
months later silberman testified during his trial that it was the 
agents idea to buy us treasury bonds that time instead of more 
yuba american gold stock 
he also testified he didnt want to complete the second deal 
but benjamin threatened to harm him and his family if he didnt 
golding appeared dejected as she sat behind her husband with her 
teenage daughter and other family members at mondays sentencing 
i love you she called out as he was led off to jail 
the only thing i can say is that when someone you love is in 
trouble you do the best to stand by them she said outside 
court

nearly all usproduced foods and 96 percent 
of imported foods tested last year met government standards for 
pesticide residues the food and drug administration said tuesday 
in its annual study of pesticide residues the fda said most of 
the violations found during the regular testing involved pesticides 
being used on types of produce for which use of the chemicals is 
not allowed 
the violation rate in regular testing was about the same as for 
the three previous years for both domestic and imported foods the 
fda said 
however the violation rate in targeted testing of usproduced 
food where residue problems were known or suspected jumped from 25 
percent in 1988 to 33 percent last year 
still fda acting commissioner james benson said the report 
again demonstrates that the american food supply is the safest in 
the world and far freer from pesticide residues than many 
americans imagine 
but the us public interest research group called the fdas 
assessment an outrageous distortion rick hind environmental 
program director for the group said some of the sample sizes were 
too small to be meaningful 
for example he said the fda tested only 18 cranberries 
pesticide residues were found in 16 of them though the level in 
each was under the tolerance limit set by the environmental 
protection agency such a finding should have prompted more testing 
of that food type he said 
the report also shows that of the domestic samples 63 percent 
of apples 86 percent of grapefruit and 75 percent of celery had 
residues though within tolerance limits he said 
the federal government is presenting these numbers to prove 
the longheld political opinion that pesticide residues are not a 
problem he said 
hinds group also takes issue with the tolerance levels set by 
epa 
the fda tested 7394 samples of commonly consumed domestic foods 
and 10719 imports during regular surveillance monitoring in fiscal 
1989 
of these 1 percent of the domestic samples and 4 percent of 
imports violated pesticide residue limits the report said 
the agency also analyzed 304 domestic and 381 imported samples 
in compliance testing last year of these 33 percent of domestic 
and 16 percent of imports were in violation 
the agency tested for 270 pesticides and found 108 the report 
said this is about the same as found in previous years 
imported foods had higher levels of pesticide residues across 
most of the food groups according to the repor 
milk eggs and other dairy products were most often found to be 
free of residue the fda was unable to detect any residues in 90 
percent of the imports and 87 percent of the domestic samples in 
this category also none of the samples in this group was in 
violation of the tolerance limits 
fruits were more likely to contain residues the report said 56 
percent of the domestic samples and 60 percent of imports had no 
trace of pesticides while 43 percent of domestic and 38 percent of 
imported fruit samples had residues within the tolerance levels

plans were laid tuesday for a showdown in the 
house on whether to allow china to export billions of dollars in 
toys and clothing to the united states under low tariffs despite 
beijings alleged human rights abuses 
the house ways and means committee on a voice vote without 
dissent but contrary to the views of most of its members sent to 
the full house a measure that would undo president bushs decision 
to continue chinas most favored nation trade status 
the vote effectively allows the measure to be paired against a 
bill the committee endorsed in july that would maintain low tariffs 
on chinese imports another year but condition them after that to 
significant progress by beijing on human rights issues 
while i disapprove this resolution i dont want to play games 
with it said rep sam gibbons dfla chairman of the panels 
trade subcommittee and a leading proponent of untying trade to 
human rights and diplomatic issues 
the bush administration vigorously opposes suspending chinas 
10yearold status as a mostfavorednation trading partner which 
effectively reduces the tariffs on chinese imports by 90 percent 
a chinesemade sweater with an import price of 20 now carries a 
tariff of 120 cents without mostfavored status it would cost 
32 to import the sweater 
the united states imported about 12 billion in chinese goods 
last year and sent to china some 58 billion in us exports 
amnesty international and a coalition of other human rights 
labor and chinese student groups want normal trade status suspended 
because of beijings forced suppression of tiananmen square 
demonstrators in june 1989 
so what if the president vetoes this resolution and congress 
fails to override him said rep richard schulze rpa at 
least the chinese government will understand that the ground it 
stands on in the eyes of americans is at best extremely shaky a 
conditionality bill just wont get this message across 
similar measures disapproving bushs continuation of 
mostfavoredtrade status for china have been introduced in the 
senate by majority leader george mitchell dmaine and sens 
alfonse damato rny and alan dixon dill 
however none of them have the support of sen lloyd bentsen 
dtexas chairman of the senate finance committee which has 
postponed action until after the full house acts 
in a related action the ways and means panel on tuesday also 
approved granting lower mostfavorednation tariffs to 
czechoslovakia under a trade agreement signed between the two 
countries last april

imelda marcos testified with immunity tuesday 
before a federal grand jury investigating allegations that 
westinghouse electric corp bribed her late husband to secure a 
nuclear power plant contract 
the former first lady of the philippines who was greeted by 
cheering supporters as she entered and left the courthouse 
testified for more than two hours in the morning and returned in 
the afternoon 
the questioning was led by theodore greenberg deputy chief of 
the us justice departments fraud division 
mrs marcos attorney james p linn said she was questioned 
more about the jewelry on her hands than her knowledge of any 
illegal payoffs to her husband ferdinand the former philippine 
president 
thats not the purpose of the united states government linn 
told reporters before climbing into a limousine with mrs marcos 
and some of her entourage 
the grand jury subpoenaed mrs marcos in connection with 
allegations that pittsburghbased westinghouse paid 173 million 
in bribes to associates of marcos and to the former president who 
held office from 1965 until he was deposed in 1986 officials 
havent named the targets of the criminal probe 
the bribery allegations were made in a civil lawsuit philippine 
government filed in 1988 against westinghouse 
linn said mrs marcos knows nothing about any payments 
ferdinand marcos was not the kind of man who sat down every 
night and discussed business with his wife he said 
many in the crowd of about 100 filipinoamericans said they 
thought mrs marcos is being made a scapegoat by the us 
government at the request of philippine president corazon aquino 
signs they carried read us stop harassing imelda 
imelda not guilty send her home and enough is enough free 
imelda now 
in addition to the bribery allegations the philippine 
government also charges that the neverused nuclear plant located 
on the bataan peninsula about 60 miles west of manila was flawed 
and its construction was substandard 
westinghouse in a statement issued tuesday said the philippine 
government has refused to operate the plant for political reasons 
the company said it never has been charged with wrongdoing in 
connection with the plant despite more than a dozen years of 
investigations 
the allegations of improper conduct are stale unfounded and 
should be finally put to rest westinghouse said 
mrs marcos has no connection with westinghouse and she will 
have nothing to add to this drawnout investigation the company 
said we do not understand why she has been subpoenaed to 
testify apparently neither does she 
the company said in another statement issued last week that it 
paid 17 million over 10 years to sales representatives who helped 
secure the contract for the 23 billion plant 
mrs marcos was acquitted in july of unrelated federal fraud 
charges after a 10week trial in new york prosecutors in that case 
alleged she helped her husband loot their countrys treasury of 
more than 220 million using the money to buy new york real 
estate art and jewelry 
she still faces several federal lawsuits linn said 
he dismissed suggestions that his client needed immunity to 
testify 
the government requested it and we had no objection he 
said no lawyer in his right mind would decline immunity

federal investigators said tuesday that one of 
the worst commuter air crashes in us aviation history occurred 
last year when the pilot flew into a bank of clouds at a 
dangerously low altitude and slammed into a mountain ridge on 
hawaiis molokai island 
all 20 people aboard the aloha islandair plane were killed in 
the oct 28 1989 accident including eight members of the molokai 
high school volleyball team 
the national transportation safety board concluded that the 
probable cause of the accident was the decision of the pilot 
captain bruce pollard 30 to continue the flight into clouds that 
obscured the rising mountainous terrain 
but it also blamed the management of the commuter airline aloha 
islandair for inadequate supervision of its personnel and for 
inadequate training and operations 
and it said the federal aviation administration had failed to 
provide adequate supervision of aloha islandair operations 
particularly at a time when it was rapidly expanding its 
operations 
when youre operating carrying passengers there is an 
enormous responsibility there to the public said susan coughlin 
the safety boards vice chairman after the boards morninglong 
examination of the accident 
they were not taking the care that was necessary to assure 
safe flight and that is the responsibility of an air carrier 
she told reporters 
safety board members said that any one of a dozen factors could 
have resulted in preventing the aloha islandair accident plus two 
earlier ones in hawaii 
and they said it could have been avoided altogether had the 
plane been equipped with a ground proximity warning device 
the safety board said radar data revealed that the aircraft had 
descended from its intended cruising altitude of 1000 feet to 500 
feet when the crash occurred 
safety board staff members said flying at such a low altitude is 
prohibited by faa regulations and is basically illegal 
ms coughlin noted that investigators had discovered that aloha 
islandair had cut back required pilot training from the 44 hours 
ordered by the faa to 24 hours 
i would consider that a pretty important factor in this 
accident she said 
the board said pollard had a record of performance 
difficulties before joining alohaair including a 180day 
suspension 
and it faulted airline management for not adequately checking 
pollards background before hiring him 
it also said that the first officer on the flight had not 
received faaapproved ground training and was therefore 
disqualified to serve in that capacity

here are the environmental protection agencys 
fuel economy ratings for 1991 model cars vans and light trucks 
the first column gives the manufacturer and the model a d 
after the name indicates the vehicle has a diesel engine a g 
indicates the car is subject to the gas guzzler tax and a p 
indicates the car uses premium gasoline 
the second column shows miles per gallon in city driving the 
third column miles per gallon in highway driving and the fourth 
column miles per gallon combining both city and highway driving 
the fifth column indicates engine displacement in cubic inches 
and the number of cylinders 
the last column indicates the type of transmission and the 
number of gears an a designation indicates automatic 
transmission an l designation indicates automatic transmission 
with a fuelsaving device that eliminates slippage an m 
designation indicates manuel transmission for example an a4 
means a fourspeed automatic transmission an m5 means a 
fivespeed manuel transmission and an l3 means a threespeed 
automatic transmission with a fuelsaving antislippage device 
in some cases identical car listings with the same engine 
displacement cylinders and transmission may show slightly 
different mileage because of equipment or other differences not 
shown in the table 
the mileage figures reflect test conditions for some years the 
epa has adjusted the test results through the use of a weighting 
formula so the mileage more closely reflects actual driving 
conditions the combined mileage is calculated on an assumption 
that 55 percent of the miles driven are driven under city 
conditions 
the mileage tests are conducted by the manufacturer with about 
30 percent confirmed in separate tests by the epa some 
manufacturers may not have completed tests in time and their cars 
are not listed

the american medical association asked 
president bush on tuesday to fire a government official who 
physicians say has been reckless and unfair in his investigation of 
medicare and medicaid fraud 
the ama in a letter to the president said that in carrying out 
his oversight duties at the department of health and human 
services inspector general richard kusserow has discredited the 
administration 
competent and honest physicians have been damaged and many 
more have been unnecessarily harassed the ama letter said 
kusserow was out of town tuesday and could not be reached for 
comment his spokeswoman judy holtz said the office was surprised 
by the amas action she said she ould not comment except to say 
the inspector generals record speaks for itself 
rep fortney pete stark dcalif chairman of the house 
ways and means subcommittee on health quickly came to kusserows 
defense putting out a statement shortly after the ama released its 
letter to reporters 
criticism from the ama is a red badge of courage to mr 
kusserow said stark whose proposals often are opposed by 
physicians 
anyone who resists giving the ama completely free access to 
the treasury and the taxpayers wallet is immediately branded by 
the ama as antidoctor he said dick kusserow should get a 
medal for saving the taxpayer fortunes that he is being criticized 
today is a sure sign he is doing his job 
dr robert mcafee vice chairman of the ama board of trustees 
said frustration over kusserows actions has built up over the last 
five years to the point that physicians dont trust him any 
more 
mcafee said the ama wants incompetent and dishonest physicians 
out of the medicaid and medicare programs and out of the medical 
profession as much as kusserow 
but mcaffee said the ama has had to go to court to win 
fundamental protections for physicians accused of misconduct and to 
dismantle a reward system for enforcers working for kusserow 
the ama was particularly upset by kusserows statements last 
week on abcs prime time live in which he said a physician who 
had been kicked out of the medicare program and later killed 
himself had been a drug abuser later in the segment kusserow was 
reported to have retracted his comment a week after the interview 
was taped saying drug use was not an issue in the case

the house appropriations committee voted an 
extra 2 billion tuesday to pay for us military operations in the 
persian gulf and proposed that the president be allowed to activate 
reservists for up to 12 months 
present law limits such callups without congressional approval 
to a total of six months 
the votes came as the committee approved legislation designed to 
keep the government operating until oct 20 the stopgap measure is 
necessary because congress has not enacted any of the 13 annual 
appropriations bills for the budget year which begins oct 1 
there was no debate on the additional money for persian gulf 
operations or on giving the president authority to call up 
reservists for longer periods a related provision appropriating 
20 million in imminentdanger pay for us forces in the gulf 
region also was approved without controversy 
but president bushs recommendation that 67 billion in 
egyptian debt be forgiven in recognition of egypts support in the 
gulf was put aside for fear it would fail if brought to a vote 
instead the committee accepted a plan by reps david obey 
dwis and mickey edwards rokla to make egypt eligible for 
additional aid under the law aid may not be extended to a nation 
that is a year or more in arrears in repaying earlier assistance 
egypt will be a year behind in payments starting oct 4 
several members of the panel praised egyptian president hosni 
mubaraks courage in sending thousands of troops to saudi arabia to 
help us forces defend against a possible attack by iraq 
his life is really on the line said rep bob livingston 
rla 
the debt is bound to be forgiven sooner or later said rep cw 
bill young rfla why do we hang president mubarak out to dry 
while we play with smoke and mirrors why give radical arabs in 
egypt a reason to go against president mubarak 
rep robert mrazek dny said forgiving the debt might send a 
signal that the united states was trying to buy egypts support 
we are rapidly approaching a crisis in our country what is the 
message to the american people on forgiving a 7 billion debt at 
a time when many americans fear loss of jobs because of a slumping 
economy he asked 
the bill could be considered by the house on thursday giving 
mebers their first opportunity to cast a meaningful vote on the 
gulf operations

the senate voted tuesday to spend 523 
billion on agriculture and rural development programs in fiscal 
1991 an increase of about 7 billion over the current year 
the 7919 vote sends the bill to a conference committee with the 
house whose version is about 19 billion less costly 
unlike the house the senate supplied 3258 million in its bill 
to continue federal crop insurance a subsidized program through 
which private insurance companies protect farmers from the 
potential financial ruin of weather disasters 
the house favoring direct aid for weather disasters voted to 
spend 1015 million on a phaseout program for crop insurance 
agriculture interests in the house counted on the senate to save 
the program and planned to fight for it in conference committee 
all but about 1017 billion of the total appropriations bill is 
earmarked for entitlement programs such as food stamps which are 
protected from deficit reduction cuts 
many of these programs require increased spending because of 
increased participation 
food stamp participation for example was up to 20 million 
people by the end of the fiscal year the highest since 1985 the 
senate voted to spend 19 billion on food stamps next year about 
12 million more than the house approved 
the bill also provides 235 billion for the popular wic feeding 
program for poor pregnant women nursing mothers and their infants 
it funds the special milk program in schools subsidizes school 
lunches and breakfasts and supplies money for several other 
nutrition programs 
other agriculture programs supported by money in the bill 
include administrative operations rural development and 
international programs the bill also funds the food and drug 
administration and the commodity futures trading commission 
the money that goes for subsidies on certain commodities is 
subject to deficit reduction cuts and could be adjusted after a 
budget agreement is reached

reducing world poverty remains the major 
challenge of the world bank despite new efforts to deal with the 
gulf crisis and emerging democracies the bank president said 
tuesday 
as the 1990s unfold success in reducing poverty should be the 
measure of global economic progress bank president barber 
conable told the opening session of the bank and international 
monetary funds annual meetings 
we meet in the shadow of the gulf crisis conable said we 
meet as eastern european nations are attempting to transform 
themselves into pluralistic marketoriented societies we meet 
when a billion of our fellow human beings continue to live in 
abject poverty 
this triple challenge occupied the opening session where 
president bush announced creation of a multination clearing house 
to coordinate financial help for countries suffering from the 
results of iraqs takeover of kuwait 
the world has experienced unprecedented development in the last 
two decades conable said citing what he called impressive 
advances against poverty including per capita annual consumption 
in developing countries up from 590 dollars to 985 life 
expectancy up from 51 to 62 years and primary education enrollment 
up from 73 to 84 percent 
but one billion people still live on less than 1 a day he 
said 
living standards in latin america have fallen below those of the 
1970s while parts of subsaharan africa have suffered a 
veritable collapse of living standards institutions and 
infrastructure he said 
bank projects stress the productive growth and efficient use of 
labor he said while protecting against environmental damage 
conable said the number of poor people in developing countries 
can be reduced by at least 300 million by the end of the decade 
reducing child mortality and making primary education almost 
universal

harsher penalties should be levied against 
employers who discriminate against foreignlooking workers to avoid 
hiring illegal aliens an administration task force said tuesday 
the 1986 immigration reform and control act was not intended 
to be a barrier for persons who are eligible to work but the 
evidence shows that many employers are discriminating by adopting 
exclusionary hiring practices the task force said in its report 
to congress 
those practices include hiring only applicants who prove they 
were born on us soil and rejecting legal immigrants who present 
workauthorization documents issued by the immigration and 
naturalization service the study said 
attorney general dick thornburgh endorsed the work of the task 
force 
our nations continuing commitment to fighting discrimination 
in all its guises requires that there be sufficient penalties to 
deter discrimination and adequate enforcement of prohibitions 
against discrimination thornburgh said the task forces 
recommendations will further these goals 
the task force said fines for discriminating against 
foreignlooking workers should be commensurate with the penalties 
for employers who knowingly hire illegal aliens that would 
increase the maximum fine for repeated discrimination from 2000 
to 10000 it said 
the justice departments office of special counsel for 
immigrationrelated unfair employment practices should open three 
regional offices to investigate complaints and conduct programs to 
educate employers about their legal obligations the report said 
the special counsel now has one office in washington 
the task force also recommended streamlining the procedures for 
employers to check documents that applicants present to prove 
citizenship or legal status 
the interagency panel consisting of representatives of the 
justice department the equal employment opportunity commission and 
the civil rights commission adopted many of the findings of an 
earlier study by the general accounting office 
the 1986 immigration reform law provided amnesty for hundreds of 
thousands of illegal aliens living in the country when it was 
enacted

politicians consumer activists and labor 
representatives said tuesday they will lobby congress to remove the 
burden of the savings and loan bailout from average taxpayers 
today we say that enough is enough rep joseph p kennedy 
ii said at a news conference organized by the financial democracy 
campaign 
the bush sampl bailout has already cost working families close 
to 150 billion he said now the administration is telling us 
that hundreds of billions more are needed to pay off the depositors 
of failed thrifts 
the financial democracy campaign is a coalition of consumer 
labor and religious groups 
others speaking at the news conference included boston mayor 
raymond flynn ed garvey a former president of the national 
football league players union michael waldman director of public 
citizen and maude hurd president of the association of community 
organizations for reform now 
jesse jackson and consumer activist ralph nader had been 
scheduled to appear but did not attend 
the news conference was held on the first day of a public 
hearing in denver on conflictofinterest charges against president 
bushs son neil who was a director of a failed colorado savings 
and loan 
another group the september 25th coalition demonstrated 
tuesday at the washington headquarters of the us league of 
savings institutions the industrys main lobbying group 
about 20 people protested what they called sampl robbery some 
played cymbals drums and tambourines as they carried signs that 
read hey hey we wont pay throw them all in jail today 
kennedy a member of the house banking committee has introduced 
legislation that would create a special surtax on affluent 
individuals and corporations to pay for the sampl bailout 
he said the measure would raise 212 billion a year the sampl 
bailout will cost taxpayers an estimated 500 billion or 2000 
per person 
the measure would create a 75 percent surtax on the unearned 
income of individuals who earn more than 100000 excluding the 
first 7500 of such income 
unearned income includes interest dividends and capital gains 
the bill also would impose a 5 percent surtax on the income of 
corporations earning more than 75000 a year 
working people received nothing from the deregulation of our 
nations thrifts except higher rates on their mortgages and small 
business loans kennedy said the people who went to the 
deregulatory party the wealthiest americans should be the 
ones to pay for it

a ceasefire among warring factions 
held for the fourth day tuesday but two rival rebel groups 
disagreed on how to form a new government and one of the groups was 
building up its troops officials said 
the spokesman for a fivenation west african army sent to halt 
liberias tribal war maj chris otulana said no violations had 
been reported in the truce since it began saturday 
but otulana said rebel leader charles taylor who initiated the 
ceasefire in the 9monthold war had started building up forces 
in areas under his control taylor has reportedly threatened to 
suspend the truce if the west african force sends in more troops 
nigerian warships bringing reinforcements and a new field 
commander for the force were expected to arrive in monrovia on 
wednesday or thursday otulana said the additional troops would 
help the force set up checkpoints to keep the rebel factions apart 
he said rebel leader prince johnson and brig gen david nimley 
commander of remnants of the army loyal to slain president samuel 
doe were cooperating with the west african force 
according to news reports on monday taylor was supposed to meet 
with the commander of does mansion guard on tuesday it was not 
known if the meeting was held 
johnson in a radio telephone call to the british broadcasting 
corp rejected taylors plan to hold elections on oct 10 
johnson said taylor had no right to call elections and that the 
proposal was unrealistic because of the collapse of the countrys 
infrastructure 
more than half a million liberians have fled to neighboring 
countries and another million of the 23 million population have 
been displaced within the country 
johnson also said he would accept an invitation by the west 
african group to meet taylor friday in freetown sierra leone 
taylor opposes a plan proposed by the economic community of west 
african states for an interim government to run the country until 
elections can be held next year the community which sent the 
fivenation task force said the temporary government could make 
sure none of the warring groups manipulates the voting 
taylor who accused doe of corruption and nepotism started the 
civil war on dec 24 when his forces invaded from ivory coast 
johnson later split with taylor and formed his own rebel faction 
more than 5000 civilians have been killed in the fighting 
doe was captured earlier this month by johnsons forces and 
tortured to death 
the capital has been cut off from the outside world for three 
months and people are dying of starvation because food supplies are 
gone 
substantial relief supplies including 50000 tons of rice from 
the us government have been waiting in neighboring ivory coast 
and sierra leone for a stable ceasefire 
once ships can begin to call in the port of monrovia which 
has been essentially closed to traffic since the end of june 
these supplies will be brought in a us government official 
said

a special kgb team foiled an attempt to hijack a 
soviet jetliner on tuesday by a man who said he had a bomb hidden 
in his briefcase the state news agency tass reported 
the man threatened to blow up the plane while at the same time 
wishing the crew a pleasant flight tass said 
it was the latest in a rash of soviet hijackings and hijack 
attempts most involving diversion of flights to nordic countries 
the wouldbe hijacker grigory polyakov 53 boarded the flight 
from leningrad to the white sea port of arkhangelsk on monday night 
and tried to divert it to stockholm sweden the report said 
a note he handed to the flight crew said according to tass 
we propose to you that the plane be directed to sweden and head 
toward stockholm if you do not do it the plane will be blown up 
we will control the course do not approach me and do not ask 
questions we wish you a pleasant flight let us be mutually polite 
and avoid crime in the name of the passengers health and 
welfare 
the crew persuaded polyakov the plane had to land at arkhangelsk 
for fuel once on the ground there authorities negotiated the 
release of the 66 passengers tass said 
a trained unit of kgb security police then captured polyakov 
the report said but gave no details including any further 
information about whether there actually was a bomb it said 
polyakov had three previous convictions including one in 1988 for 
attempting to leave the soviet union illegally 
tass said polyakov earlier was diagnosed as suffering from 
chronic paranoia

police groups tuesday accused house speaker 
thomas foley of handing law enforcement a setback by barring 
consideration of handgun controls as part of a major anticrime 
package 
the law enforcement leaders launched their criticism of foley as 
the house first started debate on the anticrime package and then 
shelved it as rebellion broke out among conservatives over its 
death penalty provisions 
foley spokesman jeff biggs responding to the criticism of the 
speaker said the house could still consider the handgun plan 
before congress adjourns in a few weeks but he said there was no 
guarantee 
police groups told a news conference that stringent controls on 
semiautomatic assault weapons and handguns are needed if police are 
to be effective in fighting crime 
should we wait until the blood of law enforcement officers an 
peaceful citizens is running in the halls of congress before we 
pass sensible gun legislation asked fraternal order of police 
leader dewey stokes 
the anticrime bill calls for the death penalty for 10 offenses 
ranging from presidential assassination to treason and espionage 
it is designed to curb delays of a decade or more in carrying out 
executions under the bill courts would be able to consider 
evidence gathered with flawed warrants if police carried out their 
searches in good faith 
president bush has been urging approval of an anticrime package 
but said recently that the one before the house would hamper 
police he urged approval of warrantless searches if police acted 
in good faith and called for more stringent provisions to prevent 
unwarranted delays in death penalty cases 
leaders of police organizations criticized a rules committee 
decision on monday barring consideration of an amendment that would 
require a sevenday waiting period for handgun purchases 
the sevenday waiting provision has been dubbed the brady bill 
by its sponsors in honor of former presidential press secretary 
jim brady severely wounded by john hinckley in his attempted 
assassination of president reagan the aim of the measure is to 
give police time to check the backgrounds of wouldbe handgun 
purchasers 
police officials blamed foley for the rules committees decision 
to keep the measure separate from the anticrime package 
right now speaker foley is not permitting the brady bill to 
come to a vote on the floor of the house so who else can we 
blame stokes said 
biggs noted the house judiciary committee had approved the 
anticrime package and the handgun bill as separate measures and 
noted that foley often goes along with the wishes of committee 
chairmen he also said that foley had not ruled out consideration 
of the plan as a separate item 
can we guarantee it the answer is no he added he said the 
crime bill itself as well as the budget dispute and major farm 
legislation are guaranteed to absorb a large chunk of the houses 
time in the weeks ahead

police imposed a 9 pmto4 
am curfew tuesday on some black townships wracked by chronic 
faction fighting 
the curfew announced last week was included in police measures 
designed to halt fighting that has killed about 800 people since 
aug 12 in townships around johannesburg 
black organizations asked supporters to defy the curfew but 
several areas appeared calm after it started 
reporters said streets were empty in parts of soweto included in 
the curfew area police checked vehicles at a roadblock two 
armored police vehicles were seen patrolling 
we are quite prepared for dealing with some resistance 
police brig gen leon mellett said tuesday we certainly will 
meet some resistance 
much of the fighting has pitted xhosas and other blacks linked 
to the african national congress against zulu supporters of the 
conservative inkatha movement 
the anc the largest black opposition group said the curfew 
would leave township residents unprotected while permitting inkatha 
vigilantes and other agents of darkness to launch attacks 
it has accused police of aiding inkatha in the fighting and 
also alleged that rightwing extremists have taken part in attacks 
the government says individual police may have acted improperly 
but the force as a whole has been impartial 
these nonaggressive measures are aimed at protecting 
defenseless lawabiding residents and to ensure they sleep in 
peace police maj gen herman stadler said in a statement he 
said the curfew would check the movement of criminal elements and 
radical thugs 
township fighting has eased following periods in which dozens of 
blacks died daily the fighting spread from eastern natal province 
where five years of political and tribal warfare have killed 5000 
blacks 
police said monday the curfew would be enforced in tokoza 
vosloorus katlehong and several areas of soweto 
violators could get up to six months in jail or a 400 fine 
township residents who work at night must provide a letter of 
proof to be exempt police said soweto police also would accept 
ticket stubs to concerts movies and soccer matches for exemption 
other measures included weapons searches roadblocks police and 
military reinforcements and isolating flash points such as worker 
hostels and squatter camps 
police in durban the largest natal city said tuesday they had 
seized 785 illegal firearms they also said they increased the 
rewards for people aiding the discovery of some weapons such as 
missiles rocket launchers and machine guns

descendants of indians who were killed or 
wounded 100 years ago at wounded knee appealed tuesday for an 
apology reparations and a national monument to atone for their 
blackest day 
history has to be rewritten to show the indians side 
claudia iron hawk sully told the senate indian affairs committee 
apologies and memorials have to be made to the victims 
descendants 
sullys grandmother was among the victims of the battle or 
massacre depending on the view that marked the end of the indian 
wars dec 29 1890 at wounded knee sd 
the remote site on the pine ridge indian reservation was made a 
national historic landmark 25 years ago but the victims 
descendants hope to use the 100th anniversary to win the 
compensation and official apology they have long sought 
the government should stand tall admit it was wrong and atone 
for that massacre said mario gonzalez an attorney for the 
wounded knee survivors association 
the group wants congress to declare the site a national 
monument which would make it a part of the national park service 
and compensate the survivors for the estimated 20000 in property 
taken from the victims plus interest 
the compensation could be made in the form of benefits to indian 
tribes 
their chances of getting any of that in the waning days of the 
101st congress are slim 
the wounded knee descendants insisted that event was a massacre 
and that many more indians were killed than was officially 
acknowledged 
we hurt and cry deep in our souls as we remember the stories 
told to us by our families said sully each of us here knows 
more about the truth of the blackest day than any historian or 
indian expert or classroom book will every know 
sully said 426 lakota sioux indians including warriors women 
elderly people and children were killed when they were attacked 
while in the custody of drunken members of the us 7th cavalry 
her grandmother then 16 was wounded in the arm and suffered 
psychologically for the rest of her life sully said 
the department of the interior however puts the death toll 
lower and gives a differing account of the event that is more 
charitable to the troops 
about 153 indians were killed of the 400 present and 44 were 
wounded said knute knudson deputy assistant interior secretary 
the firing began when an indian fired his gun as soldiers were 
trying to disarm him knudson said

failed savings and loans managed by the 
government added 102 billion to the cost of the thrift bailout in 
the apriljune qurter regulators said tuesday 
the resolution trust corp said operating losses at the 247 sampls 
in its control at the end of june rose 22 percent from the previous 
quarter when they totaled 840 million at the same institutions 
however they were down 1 percent from the second quarter of 1989 
when they totaled 104 billion 
operating losses represent the cost of keeping the institutions 
open until regulators can sell or close them 
analysts said the increase in operating losses underscores the 
urgency of handling failed thrifts as soon as possible however 
the trust corporation will hit a cash crunch after this month 
unless congressional and administration negotiators at the budget 
summit agree to provide more money 
total losses at the governmentrun thrifts were 262 billion in 
the second quarter a deterioration from 222 billion in the first 
quarter and from 245 billion a year ago total losses include 
recognition of bad loans and other assets that went sour before the 
government seized the thrifts 
the report on governmentcontrolled sampls came one day after the 
office of thrift supervision disclosed losses for the 2452 
privatelyrun thrifts 
combining the two reports the entire industry lost 63 billion 
in the first half of the year nearly as much as the 77 billion 
in the first half of 1989 and 71 billion in the first half of 
1988 
nevertheless trust corporation officials said their analysis of 
the most recent data shows that the government cleanup is reducing 
losses at the end of the first quarter 350 sampls operated under 
government control and lost 35 billion 
by eliminating a large number of institutions that were 
generating losses rtc resolution activity has had the effect of 
reducing the costs of operating the conservatorship program said 
l william seidman chairman of the agency 
as of monday 220 institutions were run by the government the 
agency said that if it had managed to reduce its inventory of 
failed thrifts to those institutions six months earlier then 
losses in the second quarter would have been 194 billion instead 
of 262 billion

consultants assisting the government on the mx 
nuclear missile and a fiberoptic guided missile also worked for 
defense contractors on the same weapons congressional 
investigators said tuesday 
the general accounting office said it found no basis to conclude 
that any of the three cases they examined resulted in a conflict of 
interest but one lawmaker expressed reservations 
taken separately each of the gao findings in this report is 
cause for concern said sen david pryor dark taken 
together they paint a very grim picture indeed of the system by 
which the pentagon procures hardware for the national defense 
the watchdog agency of congress found that consultants were 
trusted to certify that they had no associations that represented a 
conflict of interest 
pryor said such a system would not work because dishonest 
consultants will not volunteer their guilt 
the defense department estimates it spends about 16 billion a 
year on defense consulting 
the gao said the department did not accurately identify or 
report its use of consulting services because of problems 
interpreting the definitions of these services or other internal 
control weaknesses 
without improvement in these areas the defense department and 
the congress will continue to lack accurate information on how much 
the defense department is relying on consulting services to develop 
its weapon systems the gao said 
in addition to examining the consulting work on the missiles 
the gao also found that bell helicopter textron hired a former navy 
admiral to confer with us government officials on the v22 
osprey a tiltrotor aircraft 
the defense department in comments included in the gao report 
said it agreed with the findings and recommendations and was taking 
steps to strengthen its management and reporting system 
pryor and rep les aspin dwis chairman of the house armed 
services committee requested the report

smoking two packs of cigarettes a day for 
35 years killed a man who sued a cigarette maker but he shares 
responsibility for his death and his family doesnt deserve money 
as compensation a jury decided 
the family of nathan henry horton who died of lung cancer in 
1987 at age 50 sought 17 million in the suit against the maker 
and a regional distributor of pall mall cigarettes 
jurors half of whom smoke agreed 93 monday that american 
tobacco co and greenwood distributor new deal tobacco and candy 
co were partly to blame for hortons death hortons decision to 
continue smoking despite the risk kept them from awarding the 
family a penny 
it is possible we could have let down both sides but the 
alternatives were this or a hung jury jury foreman david roach 
of oxford said in a telephone interview 
this was the only agreement we could come up with whether or 
not that is better than a hung jury is for other people to 
decide he said 
the suit sought 2 million in actual damages and 15 million in 
punitive damages the trial the second in the case was moved to 
lafayette county from holmes county the first ended in january 
1988 when the jury deadlocked 
attorney don barrett who represents hortons relatives said he 
has filed motions asking holmes county circuit court judge eugene 
bogen to award oome money for actual damages he also asked for a 
new trial on the issue of punitive damages 
they set out to see justice done and they are determined to 
see it through barrett said by telephone 
horton a durant homebuilder began the suit and his family 
pursued it after his death his widow ella mae horton declined to 
comment on the case tuesday 
roger baker director of communications for connecticutbased 
american brands inc of which american tobacco co is a 
subsidiary said tuesday that the company planned further motions 
in the case but refused to say what they were 
baker said since the matter is pending in court the company 
wouldnt comment further 
in a similar case a new jersey jury awarded a widower 400000 
in 1988 after deciding a cigarette company was partly responsible 
for his wifes lung cancer death an appeals court this year 
overturned the award and ordered a new trial 
defense lawyers argued during the latest trial that horton knew 
the risks of smoking but chose to continue barrett claimed pall 
mall cigarettes are defective and dangerous 
we decided both parties were at fault roach said monday 
adding that he and eight other jurors thought the american 
tobacco co acted in an irresponsible way it was a very close 
decision we were fairly near a hung jury frankly 
mary aronson a washington analyst who was at the threeweek 
trial on behalf of tobacco investment clients said monday as 
long as damages are not awarded i believe wall street will view 
this as a win for the industry this was considered the best case 
against tobacco companies yet no award was made 
barrett said that the jury verdict should have led to a damage 
award 
we proved overwhelmingly that he suffered horrible damages 
but the jury punted on that barrett said

the government on tuesday issued a policy paper on 
tackling pollution improving the environment and changing 
britains image as dirty man of europe 
environment secretary chris patten called the 300page policy 
document the first really comprehensive statement of government 
policy on the environment ranging from the street corner to the 
stratosphere 
but environmental agencies said the plan entitled this common 
inheritance contains few new initiatives and is simply a listof 
good intentions 
it is a woolly wishlist of what the government might like to 
see happening towards the end of the century without making any 
commitment to action now said a statement from greenpeace 
britain remains the dirty man of europe 
the european commission has attacked britain for its plan to 
continue dumping more than 200000 tons of industrial waste in the 
north sea annually until 1992 despite an agreement among european 
nations that was to have stopped industrial dumping by last 
january 
britain also is one of eight european nations dumping mercury 
lead cadmium and dioxins into the north sea 
patten said several of the major efforts listed in the document 
are already under way these include a 526 billion program to 
improve water quality and a 1128 billion industry initiative to 
fight acid rain 
the governments environmental protection bill introduced in 
december and to be debated by parliament later this year includes 
measures such as fines for unlicensed waste dumping at sea new 
restraints on radioactive substances and tougher standards of waste 
disposal 
patten said the government also would work toward increasing 
regenerating capacity from renewable resources such as wind and sea 
power to 1000 megawatts by the year 2000 a tenfold increase on 
current capacity 
he also promised efforts against carbon dioxide release 
the greenpeace statement said the government had failed to act 
on radioactive pollution marine and river pollution toxic waste 
imports global warming energy policy transport policy acid rain 
and ozone layer protection 
britain is a radioactive dustbin it said importing 
thousands of tons of nuclear waste from all over the world 
toxic waste from europe especially italy and germany is being 
processed at british plants 
a spokesman for friends of the earth who spoke on condition he 
not be named said the document was a program for discussion 
rather than a program for action we are disappointed

as crude oil approaches 40 per barrel some 
analysts say consumers should enjoy 135 a gallon gasoline while 
they can 
gas prices are likely to go up perhaps even beyond 2 per 
gallon if a shooting war breaks out in the persian gulf experts 
said tuesday and if oil should stay high for a sustained period 
the fallout will be widespread running up the cost of practically 
everything while slowing economic growth 
this is not good news for the consumer said peter beutel 
an oil analyst with pegasus econometric group inc in hoboken nj 
the problem with energy is it permeates the economy like a ripple 
in a pond its not just the price of heating oil and the price of 
gasoline 
not all analysts believe oil will stay as high as it is they 
say that too much war hysteria may have been built into the market 
that iraqs ability to take out saudi arabian oil facilities may be 
overestimated and that replacing a bombed oil well is much simpler 
than replacing a bombed factory 
others including beutel say 40 barrels of oil seem inevitable 
in the near future some estimates have put oil at 60 to 65 
during a war 
on tuesday oil prices dipped as traders took profits from a 
surge a day earlier and awaited developments in the persian gulf 
the benchmark grade light sweet crude fell 72 cents to 3753 
per barrel for november contracts on the new york mercantile 
exchange 
some analysts suggested prices would resume their climb 
wednesday because of the un security council vote taken after 
markets closed to extend the embargo on iraq and kuwait by 
authorizing an air blockade 
oil prices have climbed steadily since iraq invaded kuwait last 
month saddam husseins saberrattling this week put them less than 
1 away from the ominous 40 figure crude last reached that 
plateau a decade ago in the last oil crisis 
what it means im afraid in solid terms is the consumer is 
probably going to be lucky to find 135 gasoline and probably a 
lot more of us are going to find 160 to 185 gasoline beutel 
said were probably going to see the average consumer pay 50 
percent more for heating oil than he did last year 
stanley feldman a finance professor at bentley college in 
boston does not predict sustained oil prices at 40 but consumers 
would be hit hard if it happens 
at 40abarrel oil youre probably looking at somewhere 
close to 190 for regular gasoline maybe 2 feldman said 
oil at 60 could push gasoline over 2 at the pump the experts 
said 
gasoline and heating oil are commonly watched when crude starts 
getting more expensive but america is so dependent on oil that the 
price of many other items would also be affected 
air fares for instance have increased to accommodate higher 
jet fuel while drugs and foods would also be affected they depend 
on oil for their production transportation and refrigeration 
oil is the basis of plastics and we still have a lot of 
oilfired electrical generating plants said david farnsworth a 
political science professor at wichita state university there 
are many ways that its used it has its impact on asphalt in the 
highways and how much street repair you can do 
feldman estimates 40 oil could push up consumer prices from 5 
percent to 8 percent once all the economic ripples set in 
that assumes the oil price stays at 40 for a sustained period 
of time namely a year he said 
buetel said each 10 increase in oil adds about 1 percent to the 
inflation rate 
in addition oil at 40 per barrel could cut about 1 percent out 
of the nations economic growth said feldman who termed such a 
scenario significant when the economys already in the midst of a 
recession 
farnsworth puts gasoline at only about 150 per gallon if oil 
stays around 40 he thinks much of the increase consumers have 
already felt was based on panic 
but higher oil could have broader implications farnsworth said 
because oil prices are set in dollars and the dollar has been 
weaker in europe if high oil prices persist until 1992 when 
european nations hope to integrate their economies the united 
states could find itself at a disadvantage in trade talks he said

staff from jordans consulate and embassy tuesday and jordan 
recalled its ambassador in protest the foreign ministry said 
the saudi governments order left a skeleton staff of four 
employees each in the jordanian embassy in riyadh and its consulate 
in jiddah according to the announcement read on state jordan 
radio 
no comment was available immediately from saudi authorities 
naser batayneh jordans ambassador to saudi arabia was 
recalled to protest the inexcusable saudi action the jordanian 
announcement said 
last week saudi arabia expelled 20 jordanian embassy and 
consulate employees for activities incompatible with their 
status a diplomatic euphemism for espionage 
saudi officials said the diplomats were spying on military 
installations in collaboration with iraq the saudis expelled 46 of 
the 50 yemenis at the embassy in saudi arabia for the same reason 
jordanian foreign minister marwan kassem denied the spying 
report but several jordanian officials including a cabinet 
minister privately confirmed it 
the expulsions showed saudi irritation with jordans proiraqi 
stance following the invasion and annexation of kuwait last month 
the saudi government also was unhappy about a conference of radical 
palestinians in amman last week at which calls were heard for 
suicide attacks against the us military buildup in saudi arabia 
saudi arabia last week cut off oil supplies to jordan claiming 
46 million in unpaid bills saudi grants to jordan also were 
likely to be cut officials said

dial d for diploma 
university students can now take exams from the comfort of their 
own homes using a telephone message system called telequiz 
i love it but i dont know why said student jean pajak 
maybe its the spontaneity of it 
in what is believed to be first student testing via touchtone 
telephone students at suburban governors state university called 
in the answers to their psychology 519 quiz over the weekend 
they answered by punching in numbers that were registered with 
computerized voicemail equipment 
seeing things in print in front of you gives you more time to 
go back and change the answers said pajak 35 who returned to 
school seeing a masters degree with this you really have to 
concentrate 
pajak and classmates took a 10question multiple choice quiz 
punching the numbers 1 through 4 on the phone to register their 
answers with a school computer 
students taking management 421 will try the program this week 
taking an exam of 15 truefalse questions by pressing 1 for true or 
2 for false 
its a replacement for the oldfashioned no 2 lead pencil 
said donald fricker a professor of management information systems 
who developed the idea 
fricker said telequiz saves time and money 
i can administer any quiz in just two or three days as opposed 
to where the secretary has to type it i have to copy it the class 
has to meet and i still have to grade it he said 
the system also eliminates the need to travel to the college in 
suburban university park the 5000student school has no 
dormitories and many students have outside job and family 
responsibilities 
the system lets instructors record up to 30 questions it can 
handle just one student at a time 
quiz takers have six or seven seconds to think of an answer 
before the next question is asked too short a time for a student 
to cheat by looking up the answer in a book fricker said 
telequiz will be demonstrated in november to representatives of 
600 schools at the annual computers on campus conference in myrtle 
beach sc 
teresa barker took the test sunday night sitting at the kitchen 
table after she had cleared the dinner dishes 
being at home it was different than being somewhere where 
theres a lot of pressure said barker 52 a childwelfare 
worker pursuing an undergraduate degree 
some students called as early as 8 am saturday and sunday the 
last student to call saturday phoned in at at 1038 pm 
the system gives a student tremendous flexibility fricker 
said the student can be at his most relaxed he can call in at 4 
am if thats when hes achieved nirvana and feels he knows the 
material

democrats on the house appropriations 
committee shouted down president bushs veto threat tuesday and 
voted to delay for 20 days deep spending cuts that will be 
triggered unless congress and the white house agree on a 
deficitreduction plan 
if the 85 billion in arbitrary spending reductions are allowed 
to take effect as scheduled oct 1 chairman jamie whitten 
dmiss told the committee it threatens to bring the economy to 
its knees we cant afford the risk 
a fullblown crisis may be required to force negotiators 
into solving the deficit said rep silvio conte of massachusetts 
the senior republican on the committee 
at the white house an angry bush told reporters if there is 
no budget agreement with real spending reductions and real process 
reform by the end of the week i will have to veto it i do not 
want to see further delay in kicking this problem on down the 
road 
the house is likely to consider the bill later this week 
no deficit agreement was in sight although top leaders of 
congress and the administration claimed some progress the goal is 
a combination of targeted spending reductions and tax increases 
that would cut the deficit by 50 billion during the 12 months 
beginning monday and an additional 450 billion in the following 
four years 
house republican leader bob michel of illinois told reporters he 
is ready to drop bushs coveted capitalgains tax cut which has 
been the thorniest issue in the negotiations in my opinion the 
doggone price is too steep he said 
michel said the administration is considering other options for 
stimulating the economy options that might be more acceptable to 
democratic leaders who consider a capitalgains cut nothing but a 
windfall for the rich democrats are insisting that any 
capitalgains reduction be offset by raising other taxes on the 
wealthy 
the stopgap spending legislation approved by the house panel is 
necessary because none of the 13 annual appropriation bills has 
been enacted and a new budget year begins in less than a week 
for the first time in several years federal workers are taking the 
threat of furloughs seriously 
people are literally losing sleep over this said tom 
doherty an occupational safety and health administration inspector 
from allentown pa they have kids to feed and house payments to 
make and now theyre having the rug swept out from under them by 
the system they work for 
with the monday deadline in mind the house panel agreed by a 
nearly partyline 3220 vote to continue spending basically at 
present levels through oct 20 and to block any threatened 
acrosstheboard spending cuts including those that could bring 
mass furloughs of federal workers before that date 
in an effort to discourage a veto the democraticcontrolled 
committee attached to the measure 2 billion of money to support 
the largescale deployment of us military forces in the persian 
gulf 
this wont protect it said rep mickey edwards rokla 
the president does intend to veto it 
his bushs political advisers are not crazy enough to tell 
him to veto this said rep neal smith diowa 
whitten said he had talked to bush earlier in the day and he 
didnt tell me he was going to veto it 
for anyone to let the whole country go to pot its a 
question of whether hes patriotic or his judgment has gone sour 
whitten said 
despite the looming financial breakdown in the government the 
committee spent more of its session talking of the other major 
crisis the persian gulf the panel 
voted to double to 12 months the maximum time for which 
military reservists may be activated for operation desert shield 
approved an extra 20 million to provide imminent danger 
pay to troops in the gulf 
sidestepped bushs request to forgive 67 billion in egyptian 
debt in appreciation of that nations contributions to protecting 
saudi arabia from iraqi attack both sides agreed that domestic 
political pressures the unpopularity of foreign aid would have 
defeated the proposition if it had been brought to a vote 
instead the committee agreed by voice vote to waive a law that 
would have barred egypt from further us aid because of failure to 
repay past debts 
made clear that other countries contributions to the costs of 
operation desert shield must be channeled through the regular 
congressional appropriations process the administration had 
proposed to let the pentagon handle such funds without intervention 
by congress 
the committee stripped from the bill a section aimed at 
prohibiting the national endowment for the arts from supporting 
any indecent antireligious or obscene picture play or 
writing 
the panels explanation of the stopgap spending resolution 
mentions what could happen if the spending cuts called a 
sequester mandated by the grammrudman law are allowed to take 
effect the effect would be disastrous not only to the 
nations economy but would have a dangerous impact on a weak 
economy the report states 
among the possibilities the air traffic control system would 
turn into chaos a major influx of illegal aliens a shortage of 
money to pay jurors compromised safety for nuclear facilities 1 
million children would miss shots social security checks for new 
applicants could be threatened internal revenue service 
enforcement could suffer by 8 billion the space shuttle would be 
grounded until 1993 and farm loans would be slashed 
top representatives of congress and the administration began 
negotiating a deficit reduction more than four months ago by most 
accounts the major obstacle has been bushs insistence that the 
tax on capital gains be reduced to increase incentives for 
investment 
democrats have resisted cutting that tax which applies to 
profits on the sale of investments because 80 percent of the 
direct benefits would go to those with incomes of 100000 a year 
or more they have insisted any such cut be accompanied by a tax 
increase of some other kind on upperincome people but the two 
parties have been unable to agree on the type of tax increase

oleg yefremovs adaptation at the yale 
repertory theater of ivanov starring william hurt in the title 
role begins and ends with a gunshot 
but what happens in between is what really counts in this dark 
moody and unrealized production of one of anton chekhovs early and 
lesserknown plays 
ivanov has attracted attention not only because of hurt one 
of the few film stars willingly to put himself on stage with any 
degree of regularity but also because of yefremov artistic 
director of the moscow art theater 
the revival certainly looks authentic the design by david 
borovsky head artist of the moscow taganka theater is a marvel of 
the power of suggestion the decrepit facade of a country mansion 
its columns covered with gnarled leafless vines fills the wide 
playing area at the university theater 
with a few chairs strategically placed on stage in front of this 
haunted house the director conjures up the deadening bourgeois 
activity of two different families in vastly different financial 
situations 
yefremov is not afraid to tamper with the text for example he 
reshuffles scenes opening the play with a secondact party that 
has the guests commenting on ivanovs tribulations before the 
audience has seen him 
and the title character has enough troubles for several dramas 
ivanov is a man in despair i dont believe anymore he says 
he doesnt believe in his marriage to sarah his rich jewish wife 
whose parents cut off love and money to her after she married and 
he spends more time worrying about his debts than trying to earn 
money to pay them off 
but an articulation of his anxiety is hard to find in hurts 
muffled portrait of ivanov the blond bearded hurt can be a 
galvanizing actor on stage as audiences who saw his jumpstart 
performance off and on broadway in david rabes hurlyburly 
know 
here his acting is muted his voice rarely rising above a drone 
whatever magic yefremov has worked on the plays atmosphere has not 
filtered down to his star 
other members of the large underrehearsed cast seem to be left 
to their own resources losing both the comedy and the tragedy of 
the piece some fare better than others frances conroy as the 
dying sarah conveys the evenings only real sense of sadness 
zeljko ivanek has mastered the outrage of a young doctor amazed at 
ivanovs treatment of his critically ill wife and lee richardson 
has the right amount of charm as ivanovs reprobate uncle 
but austin pendleton and susan kellermann flounder as ivanovs 
prosperous neighbors and leo burmester is more allamerican 
farmhand than savvy country bumpkin 
the result is an incomplete production tantalizing for the 
atmosphere yefremov is able to coax from a production team that 
also includes costume designer jess goldstein and lighting designer 
geoff korf 
this ivanov which runs in new haven through oct 13 is an 
inviting shell of a play but not a world inhabited by real people

supported by a lobbying blitz by the president 
of el salvador the bush administration has revived efforts to head 
off deep cuts in next years military aid to the central american 
country 
administration officials said tuesday they were preparing to 
fight the issue when the 1991 foreign aid bill comes to the senate 
floor in the next few weeks and were lining up support for a cut 
that would be less than the 50 percent slash already called for by 
the house 
salvadoran president alfredo cristiani in washington for four 
days of meetings with administration and congressional officials 
continued his sales pitches tuesday in separate meetings with 
lawmakers and reporters 
cristiani promised to speed the investigation into the murders 
last november of six jesuit priests their housekeeper and her 
daughter and proposed to bring three american judges to his 
country to study how the case is being handled 
the case is testing the administratio of justice in el 
salvador cristiani told reporters at a luncheon it also has 
been the primary impetus behind congressional efforts to cut the 
countrys 85 million in military aid 
cristiani also said he would accept a 50 percent cut in military 
aid but only if congress made it contingent upon agreement of both 
sides in the decadeold conflict to a ceasefire 
rep joseph moakley dmass who heads a house democratic task 
force on el salvador that has been critical of the salvadoran 
government said he was not persuaded by the presidents proposals 
reform of the salvadoran military must come before an effective 
ceasefire can be reached moakley said that is the issue which 
has stymied united nationssponsored peace talks between the two 
warring sides 
but moakley who last month accused the military of a coverup in 
the case said he was encouraged that senior military officers were 
now agreeing to testify personally before the investigating judge 
eight officers have been arrested in the case but none has been 
brought to trial moakleys task force found that some key evidence 
has been destroyed and that testimony has been withheld 
the state department apparently is pinning its hopes for 
continued military aid on the senate 
administration officials speaking on condition of anonymity 
said they would seek to draft a milder version of the aid cut that 
could be offered as an alternative to the 50 percent cut being 
pushed by sens christopher dodd dconn and patrick leahy dvt 
the state department has largely ignored the issue for the last 
two months but has taken a renewed interest as the end of the 
fiscal year on sunday forces action on appropriations bills 
cristiani said he still hoped that the military aid could be 
rescued but added that if it were cut it would not jeopardize his 
government it would be creating more economic problems for the 
country he said but he added we do not feel the government 
is going to topple because of this

israeli leaders on both left and right raged 
tuesday against a rare common enemy a scheme that allows 
middleaged ultraorthodox jews to get veterans benefits without 
ever serving in the army 
public disclosure of the arrangement renewed the simmering 
resentment many nonobservant israeli citizens feel for 
ultraorthodox jews and their demands to change israeli society to 
fit their religious beliefs 
shulamit aloni head of the leftwing citizens rights movement 
suggested the doling out of military benefits to men who never 
serve was a way to reward ultraorthodox political parties 
this is part of an agreement to take advantage of the defense 
ministers authority to give money to this public who eats but 
never pays aloni said 
parliament member ran cohen who uncovered the scheme said the 
ultraorthodox were insulting the average israeli man who is 
drafted into the army for three years and serves in the reserves 
until age 54 
they play act as if they want to go into the army but they 
dont want to contribute to the army they want the money cohen 
said 
he said hundreds and perhaps thousands of religious jews 35 to 
50 years old were receiving benefits without ever serving in the 
army 
as cohen explained the arrangement ultraorthodox jews enlist 
in the army after getting exemptions for the draft for years of 
study of the torah 
typically the men are in their late 30s or 40s when they 
enlist and they are never called up to actually serve because of 
their age and because they often are fathers of large families 
cohen said 
but he added they are still eligible for higher benefits as 
veterans the benefits are especially important to big orthodox 
families because every israeli with three or more children gets a 
government stipend 
for example an israeli family of seven receives 213 monthly 
but the same size family headed by a veteran is eligible for 408 
the difference rises with the number of children 
israel television said a senior military forum headed by chief 
of staff lt gen dan shomron debated the issue tuesday 
the military command also issued a statement insisting it was 
not responsible for the government stipends which are handled by 
the labor and social affairs ministry it said religious jews 
drafted into the army serve in active reserve duty in accordance 
with the needs 
the army said it saw as its duty to draft religious men who have 
completed their studies at religious seminaries their number the 
last five years has totalled 4000 it said 
of these 24 percent were found unfit for service more than 50 
percent were drafted into regular and 24 percent into reserve 
units the military said 
it should be stressed that there was no major increase in the 
last year in the number of seminary students drafted into the army 
and those mobilized cannot know beforehand what they would do 
during reserve service the statement said 
lawmaker uriel lin of prime minister yitzhak shamirs ruling 
rightwing likud bloc reacted to cohens charges by calling for an 
army investigation the law cannot be made into a joke and the 
people of israel cannot be turned into a joke he said 
cohens complaints printed on front pages of israeli newspapers 
tuesday also brought angry phone calls to radio talks shows 
israelis most of whom are nonobservant jews regularly 
complain about military exemptions for the ultraorthodox

it looks like the end of the road for the 
earthquakedamaged embarcadero freeway a doubledecker span 
likened to the berlin wall for the way it separates san franciscos 
downtown and waterfront 
the board of supervisors voted monday to tear down the milelong 
stretch of the road thats been closed since the 71magnitude 
quake did widespread damage in october 1989 the freeways concrete 
support columns were damaged 
the embarcadero freeway has been san franciscos environmental 
berlin wall supervisor bill maher said it has been a blight 
on our city and our waterfront ever since it was built 
at the time of the quake the embarcadero carried 60000 cars a 
day along the waterfront to chinatown the north beach restaurant 
district and fishermans wharf the citys prime tourist 
attraction 
chinatown merchants oppose its destruction because the highway 
made it easy for tourists and other customers to get there 
technically the boards 65 vote was strictly advisory but 
federal and state officials have made it clear they will go along 
with the citys decision 
no formal demolition request has been filed by the city mayor 
art agnos said he is waiting while he tries to secure funds for an 
underground replacement highway 
the california department of transportation has said it would 
cost 546 million to repair the freeway agnos believes he can get 
more federal quakerelated emergency transportation relief funds 
after completion of new soil studies which could raise the 
estimate 
i intend to make sure that we get every single dollar that 
were eligible for agnos said 
agnos declined to put a timetable on its demolition but he said 
the boards vote goes a long way toward helping him get the 135 
million he needs to replace the freeway 
state transportation spokesman breg bayol said tuesday that 
tearing down the 30yearold freeway would take at least six 
months 
theres more to it than just tearing it down bayol said 
theres the engineering and traffic control studies to do before 
we put it out to bid some portions could be troublesome because 
theyre so close to buildings 
chinatown merchants led the battle against demolishing the 
structure pushing for a quick reopening to get traffic flowing 
into their area again 
they even closed their shops for one day in april and converged 
on city hall to protest the mayors plan 
theres still some opposition but most of its political 
said rose pak spokeswoman for the chinatown chamber of commerce 
the real turning point came when we realized the cost and time to 
repair the embarcadero this way the mayors plan didnt look so 
bad 
the freeway was controversial even before it was built in 1959 
pulitzer prizewinning architecture critic allan temko has called 
the embarcadero one of the chief horrors of the 1950s when 
technocrats started ramming freeways through cities 
he said tearing down the freeway will give san francisco a 
chance to once again be the ideal of a civilized american 
metropolis as it was before the freeway transformed one of the 
loveliest waterfronts in the world into one of the most obscene

officials in the siberian city of krasnoyarsk want 
a bust of former soviet leader konstantin u chernenko removed from 
a city square but they can find no takers a newspaper reported 
tuesday 
the likeness of the predecessor to mikhail s gorbachev was 
erected in the city about 1950 miles east of moscow after 
chernenko was awarded his third hero of socialist labor title 
the trud newspaper reported 
but the krasnoyarsk city council decided to dismantle the bronze 
bust saying established procedure calls for such monuments to 
be erected in the recipients birthplace trud said 
that would be quite impossible in chernenkos case trud noted 
since the village of bolshaya tes where he was born is now 
underwater because of a dam built for the krasnoyarsk hydroelectric 
power plant 
the residents of sharypovo a town 130 miles west of 
krasnoyarsk dont want the bust either trud said until recently 
sharypovo was named for chernenko but it has since been given its 
old name back 
krasnoyarsks city council decided to put the bust in a cultural 
museum but cant move it there until kremlin authorities rescind 
the decision that placed it in the square in the first place 
chernenko a crony of the late leonid i brezhnev led the 
soviet union from feb 13 1984 until he died on march 10 1985 
under gorbachev memorials to brezhnev and his proteges have been 
removed and their leadership has been denounced

an appeals court refused tuesday to reduce 
the 5 million bail for charles h keating the savings and loan 
executive accused of fraud in selling american continental corp 
junk bonds 
the 2nd district court of appeal said in a oneparagraph ruling 
that it considered an appeal filed monday by keatings lawyers and 
had examined transcripts of bail proceedings before superior court 
judge gary klausner 
the petition is denied the threejudge panel wrote 
the court apparently rejected arguments by keating that he is 
being made a scapegoat in a criminal fraud case involving sales of 
the nowworthless bonds through branches of irvine califbased 
lincoln savings amp loan lincoln an american continental 
subsidiary has been seized by federal regulators 
district attorney ira reiner said he was pleased the court had 
upheld 5 million bail but said he expected further efforts by the 
keating defense to win reduction of the bail by a higher court 
reiner acknowledged that 5 million is a high price for freedom 
it is an exceptionally high bail and mr keating is an 
exceptional defendant reiner said the principal factor 
involved is risk of flight you cant consider mr keating without 
thinking of robert vesco 
vesco a fugitive financier fled the united states while being 
investigated by authorities 
keating who has been held at the downtown mens central jail 
for a week contends he cant adequately defend himself if he 
remains in custody 
stephen c neal keatings main attorney said monday night that 
he would pursue every avenue to get keating out of jail the next 
appeal would be to the california supreme court and after that to 
a federal court 
keating and three codefendants surrendered to face a 42count 
state grand jury indictment on sept 18 klausner set keatings 
bail at 5 million and held the other defendants on 1 million 
bail 
after a hearing last week the judge reduced the codefendants 
bail to 100000 or 200000 klausner refused to lower keatings 
bail saying the possibility of 10 years in prison made him a 
flight risk 
keatings attorneys argued that he had not fled any of the 
numerous legal problems that have arisen since federal regulators 
seized lincoln and american continental went to bankruptcy court 
they also said he is about 5 million in debt and with the help 
of his children could only post bail of 500000 
the codefendants officers of american continental or lincoln 
posted bail last week and are free 
all four are due back in court oct 5 to enter a plea to the 
charges of misleading investors about the safety of the risky junk 
bonds sold at lincoln branches 
keating and the others are charged with ordering employees to 
steer lincoln depositors away from insured certificates of deposit 
and into the bonds

the senate voted thursday to reverse bush 
administration regulations that prohibit federally supported family 
planning clinics from offering information on abortion 
the regulations which are the subject of a case before the 
supreme court were imposed in 1988 by the reagan administratin and 
continued after president bush took office they have become the 
focus of debate between both sides of the abortion issue 
the senate voted 6335 to approve an amendment offered by sen 
john chafee rri saying the clinics must provide information 
and counseling concerning all legal and medical options to 
pregnant women who ask for it including pregnancy termination 
the clinics provide helth care and family planning services for 
the poor the amendment was added to a senate bill that extends the 
life of the family planning program established 20 years ago by 
title x of the public health service act 
the senate continued to debate other amendments to the 
reauthorization bill into the evening and a vote to limit debate 
was tentatively scheduled for wednesday 
opponents of abortion opposed the amendment arguing that the 
federal government should not encourage abortions or make them more 
available 
most americans do not want their tax dollars used in any way 
to facilitate abortions said sen orrin hatch rutah 
advocates of abortion rights argued that the regulatory ban 
discriminated against poor women preventing them from having the 
same information that women who could afford their own doctor would 
receive sen howard metzenbaum dohio called them a gag 
rule 
this program isnt about abortion its about options said 
sen barbara mikulski dmd whether its abstinence adoption or 
abortion i believe young people have a right to know 
since enactment in 1970 title x has prohibited aid from going 
to programs where abortion is a method of family planning but 
until 1988 that was interpreted as barring the use of federal money 
to pay for abortions 
the reagan administrations department of health and human 
services in 1988 adopted a broader interpretation that said federal 
money couldnt go to family planning programs that provide 
counseling and referral for abortion 
the action touched off a series of lawsuits and federal appeals 
courts have delivered conflicting rulings one of the cases is 
scheduled for argument before the supreme court in its october 
term 
why not let the court make this decision because its 
probably going to have to in the end anyway hatch said

a 14yearold girl took a page from the 
script of the movie heathers in plotting revenge against two 
11yearold playmates she allegedly fed poisoned picnic fare 
police said tuesday 
other girls invited to the picnic and croquet party were aware 
that a peanut butter sandwich had been laced with rat poison and 
some grape drink mixed with a household cleanser police spokesman 
tony burtt said 
they stood by while the victims tasted the poisoned food and 
drink sept 16 and didnt report the plot until afterward police 
said then the children told their parents 
one 11yearold girl vomited after tasting the grapeflavored 
drink and the other girl suffered stomach pains after taking 
several bites of the tainted sandwich police said neither had any 
serious aftereffects 
none of the children was identified 
the mother of the 14yearold denied that her daughter planned 
the poisoning in an interview for wednesdays editions of the 
valley daily news she blamed two other 11yearold playmates at 
the picnic the paper withheld the mothers name to avoid 
identifying the children 
at the very least they were more than just witnesses she 
said 
burtt agreed the 11yearolds may have been involved but said 
investigators believe the teenager staged the picnic to get 
revenge 
a dispute over possession of a heathers videotape and 
clothing and jewelry allegedly taken by one of the victims prompted 
the poisoning he said friends told police the teenage girl said 
she got the idea from the plot of heathers an rrated dark 
comedy featuring teenage murder and a tight clique of popular 
girls 
in the film the leader of the incrowd is killed with household 
poisons the movie opens and closes with characters playing 
croquet 
two girls told investigators they were at the 14yearolds home 
the day she came up with the plan for the picnic burtt said 
the teenager allegedly made peanut butter and jelly sandwiches

president cesar gaviria confronted with 
a resurgence of guerrilla attacks agreed tuesday to rebel demands 
for international supervision of any possible ceasefire 
gaviria made the announcement at a news conference in bogota 
shortly before leaving for the united nations 
he said international supervision of a ceasefire is possible 
any time the guerrillas halt their kidnappings taking of 
hostages terrorist attacks and their recruiting of children 15 and 
younger 
we are thereby removing any obstacle that might keep rebelious 
groups from adhering to the governments position of peace 
gaviria said 
there was no immediate response from the two main rebel groups 
that gavirias statment was aimed at the national liberation army 
and the colombian revolutionary armed forces 
the groups have been fighting in the mountains and jungles of 
colombia for more than 20 years their attacks contribute to a 
climate of violence that includes murders and kidnappings by 
rightwing death squads and drug smugglers 
the ceasefire would be the first step toward convincing the 
guerrillas to disband and form civilian groups to participate in 
the countrys politics 
a constituent assembly will meet next february to consider 
proposals to change the countrys constitution including a wider 
distribution of power now held mostly by the countrys traditional 
parties the liberals and conservatives 
the government has said that if guerrillas want to participate 
in the assembly they must sign a peace agreement and take steps 
toward disbanding 
the guerrillas have been ambushing army patrols and attacking 
towns in the last few weeks on sept 5 they blew up the main oil 
pipeline in the country 
a third major guerrilla group the april 19 movement disbanded 
last february in exchange for amnesty and the right to form a 
political party antonio navarro one of the movements leaders is 
serving as health minister for gaviria

president bush appealed tuesday for a 
generous response from the world community for countries rocked 
by the persian gulf crisis as the pentagon reported new buildups of 
iraqi troops and armor in southern iraq and occupied kuwait 
bush speaking to the annual meeting of the 152member 
international monetary fnd announced he was forming an 
international clearing house to coordinate financial help for the 
most seriously affected countries 
we are determined not to allow the brutal behavior of one 
aggressor to undermine the historic process of democratic change or 
to derail the movement towards marketoriented economic systems 
bush told the gathering of world financial leaders 
meanwhile pentagon spokesman pete williams said about 430000 
iraqi soldiers are now in southern iraq and kuwait within striking 
distance of saudi arabia last week the total was put at 360000 
williams said the iraqi deployments still appeared to be 
essentially a defensive force but were capable of readily 
converting to an offensive unit 
but bush was told earlier by turkish president turgot ozal that 
western estimates of saddam husseins military capability may be 
overstated a state department official said 
deputy assistant secretary of state james dobbins briefing 
reporters on the bushozal meeting said that ozal and his aides 
told bush that there is an inordinate concern with iraqi 
capabilities it is an exaggerated concern 
ozal himself answering questions at a national press club 
luncheon said saddam in his war with iran was supported heavily 
by russia by france by many western nations and also heavily 
supported by his neighbors arab neighbors including kuwait saudi 
arabia maybe more than 200 billion and on the other hand 
iranians were not supported by the west there was even an 
effective embargo on them for arms sales the war took eight years 
how you can say this is a strong army 
in his speech to the imf and the world bank bush said he was 
creating a gulf crisis financial coordination group to help 
transform commitments into concrete contributions 
and while the group will first meet under the auspices of the 
us treasury bush made it clear he would welcome an increased 
role by the imf in the panels deliberations 
the political leadership of the un must be matched by the 
economic leadership of the of the imf and the world bank he 
said 
earlier in the day world bank president barber conable outlined 
emergency plans to help resettle hundreds of thousands of refugees 
fleeing iraq and kuwait 
bush noted the refugee crisis as well as unemployment problems 
and serious disruptions in the price and flow of oil 
this staggering burden which is pressing upon those most 
seriously affected countries calls for a generous response from 
the world community bush said 
he noted that the united states had already begun mobilizing 
financial help for frontline states such as egypt jordan and 
turkey the united states has extracted pledges of 20 billion in 
military and financial aid from allies 
bush said that the new group expected to hold its first meeting 
on wednesday would be chaired by treasury secretary nicholas 
brady its members will also include saudi arabia kuwait the 
united arab emirates qatar germany britain italy france 
canada south korea and the european community 
an administration official said wednesdays meeting of the new 
group was an organizing session among donor countries to discuss a 
wide variety of issues including how much needs to be raised 
he would not predict whether the group an informal clearing 
house to coordinate the flow of money would be able to reach a 
consensus on the funding amount 
a west german official who briefed reporters on condition of 
anonymity said that the united states was seeking approximately 
45 billion in assistance for egypt turkey and jordan for this 
year and an additional 10 billion in 1991 
the german official said some countries may balk at the size of 
the contribution being sought by the united states he suggested 
that the us fundraising drive should be expanded to include 
switzerland and sweden 
japanese finance minister ryutaro hashimoto whose country has 
pledged 4 billion so far in the campaign against saddam hussein 
said the japanese are willing to participate in bushs crisis 
coordinating group but he indicated numerous details on the 
proposal remained to be negotiated between the large donor 
countries 
president bush gave one idea whether it will go ahead will 
depend on the response of the countries involved hashimoto told 
reporters 
earlier tuesday bush met with ozal and separately with 
portuguese prime minister cavaco silva both leaders voiced strong 
support for the usled effort to isolate saddam hussein 
in a brief ceremony after bushs meeting with ozal bush praised 
staunch allies like turkey for solidarity with the united 
nations and the united states in telling the world we will not 
tolerate this invasion 
it will not stand bush added 
bush said the united states would seek a new agreement to 
increase textile imports from turkey and he said he promised ozal 
the administration would continue to support turkeys bid to become 
the 13th member of the european community 
bush also pledge to work closely with congress to make sure 
turkey gets its fair share of military aid in the coming year 
we will also work to help modernize the turkish armed forces by 
the future sales of f16s and provision of other military 
equipment bush said 
asked by reporters at a picturetaking session in the oval 
office how long turkey could endure hardships caused by the 
embargo ozal said as much as it requires 
turkey was one of the first nations to help the united states 
after the iraqi invasion of kuwait by closing a major pipeline 
carrying iraqi oil portugal is allowing us airlift flights to 
saudi arabia to use an air base in the azores for refueling 
the portuguese leader said after his meeting with bush that the 
international community must stick together and be very 
firmnobody can accept that such a brutal aggression will pay 
off 
the pentagon said callups of reserves from all services have 
reached 21970 an increase of 317 from its previous tally 
announced last week maj doug hart a pentagon spokesman said a 
larger increase is likely to be announced late this week 
defense secretary dick cheney has said up to 50000 reserves may 
be on active duty by sept 30 in all there are over 150000 us 
troops in the middle east

a federal judge tuesday threw out 
campaign contribution limits imposed by california voters in 1988 
saying they give an unfair advantage to incumbents 
us district judge lawrence karlton knocked out the limits 
created by proposition 73 and also tossed out the propositions ban 
on transfers of funds between candidates 
the ruling sent a shock wave through californias political 
establishment although it was uncertain what effect the ruling 
would have on the gubernatorial race between democrat dianne 
feinstein and republican pete wilson 
both national political parties concerned over the outcome of 
the governors race because of reapportionment stemming from the 
1990 census have targeted the california governors race as a top 
priority 
if allowed to stand the decision means candidates for governor 
other statewide posts and in some cases local offices will have 
no contribution limits during the remaining six weeks of the 
election campaign a spokeswoman for the fair political practices 
commission said 
but fppc chairman john larson warned candidates not to start a 
fundraising frenzy saying the commission would ask karlton to 
stay his rling proposition sponsors also said they would appeal 
the decision 
larson said that if the decision remains in place the fppc will 
enforce similar contribution limits in proposition 68 but that 
measure applies only to legislative candidates 
voters approved both propositions 68 and 73 in june 1988 but 73 
took effect because it got more votes however a few minor 
provisions of 68 also became law 
proposition 73s limits which among other things allow 
individuals to give no more than 1000 to a particular candidate 
per fiscal year apply to state and local candidates 
the measure also allows political action committees to give up 
to 2500 or 5000 per candidate per fiscal year depending on the 
size of the committee 
assembly minority leader ross johnson and state sen quentin 
kopp isan francisco two of the coauthors of proposition 73 
said they planned to ask the 9th circuit court of appeal on 
wednesday to overturn karltons ruling 
the timing of this decision is most unfortunate johnson 
said closing arguments were heard april 19 and we finally get a 
ruling just six weeks before election day there will be enormous 
confusion now as hundreds of candidates at all levels of government 
try to figure out what the new rules are 
proposition 73 was sponsored as an alternative to the 
reformgroupsupported proposition 68 and bases its contribution 
limits on fiscal years that start on july 1 
since state election campaigns typically span two calendar 
years the measure creates three contribution periods the first 
six months of the nonelection year the last six months of the 
nonelection year and the first half of the election year and the 
last half of the election year 
that means that an individual contributor can give a candidate 
3000 over two calendar years 
critics say the fiscalyear format helps incumbents because they 
usually start raising funds earlier than challengers karlton 
agreed 
karlton issued the decision in response to a lawsuit filed by 
the state democratic party and labor unions which said proposition 
73 unfairly limited constitutional rights to free speech and 
association

two canadians tourists beaten by a gang that 
mistook their help for an elderly woman as a mugging got some help 
from neighborhood merchants including 100 in cash auto repairs 
and a free lunch 
merchants in bensonhurst the predominantly white brooklyn 
neighborhood where black teenager yusef hawkins was killed by a 
mob in august 1989 took up a collection for the tourists tuesday 
with all the bad with the hawkins killing last year im glad 
something good came out of the neighborhood instead of something 
negative said vinny pinello owner of reliable auto repair 
eric plourde 19 and patrick chartrand 20 both of quebec 
were beaten with baseball bats and pipes monday afternoon while 
assising an elderly woman who fell police detective joseph 
mcconville said 
apparently these kids thought these two guys were mugging the 
old lady mcconville said the group numbered between 10 and 12 
members he said 
the canadian men were treated at coney island hospital for 
bruises after the beating and released spokesman daniel armstrong 
said 
gang members also smashed their cars windshield and two other 
windows police said pinello said he began organizing assistance 
after officers asked him for some plastic to cover the shattered 
windows 
no arrests were made in the case and authorities were searching 
for the youths and the woman who left the scene before police 
arrived 
tourists have suffered notable crimes in new york this summer 
with a utah tourist stabbed to death while protecting his mother 
during a manhattan subway mugging and a soviet visitor slain by 
thieves who snatched his wifes purse 
after learning that plourde and chartrand only had 25 between 
them merchants got up 100 in maybe 90 seconds pinello said 
im sorry we didnt give them more 
while the money was being collected a customer at the auto 
store bought the young men sandwiches by late tuesday the cars 
smashed windows were fixed at no charge 
they were so appreciative when we handed them the money they 
looked like they were going to cry said fred alvaro owner of 
freval home improvement who added that he helped so that they 
dont get the impression that all new yorkers are bad 
these kids are like a pack of wild dogs they follow the 
leader alvaro said of the gang that attacked the tourists whom 
he described as nice kids who werent looking to hurt a fly

in a decision that could have a 
profound impact on the november governors election a federal

california voters in 1988 
the decision if allowed to stand means candidates for

us district judge lawrence karlton said the limits give an 
unfair advantage to incumbents karlton also tossed out the a ban 
on transfers of funds between candidates that was imposed by the 
same ballot initiative 
the ruling invalidated proposition 73 which among other 
things limits individuals to a maximum of 1000 in contributions 
to a particular candidate per fiscal year the measure also limits 
political action committees donations of 2500 or 5000 per 
candidate per fiscal year depending on the size of the committee 
the ruling sent a shock wave through californias political 
establishment although it was uncertain what effect the ruling 
would have on the gubernatorial race between democrat dianne 
feinstein and republican pete wilson 
wilson who had only token opposition in the june primary 
raised 125 million through june and had 39 million in the bank 
as of july 1 feinstein raised 81 million through june but had 
only 645344 left over from her primary campaign against state 
attorney general john van de kamp 
aides to both candidates claimed not to know how much they have 
raised since june 
wilson challenged feinstein to join him in abiding by 
proposition 73 if karltons ruling is upheld but spokesman bill 
livingstone would not commit the candidate to following the measure 
if feinstein doesnt follow suit 
feinstein spokeswoman deedee myers said feinstein hadnt decided 
what to do 
she said that removal of the limits gives us a chance to close 
the gap a little but she predicted wilson would still raise more 
money 
but john larson chairman of the fair politicial practices 
commissio warned candidates against a fundraising frenzy 
saying the commission would ask karlton to stay his ruling the 
proposition sponsors also said they would appeal the decision 
the decision was in a lawsuit filed by the state democratic 
party and labor unions which said proposition 73 unfairly limited 
constitutional rights to free speech and association 
proposition 73 which was sponsored by three legislators as an 
alternative to the reformgroupsupported proposition 68 bases its 
contribution limits on fiscal years that start on july 1 
since state election campaigns typically span two calendar 
years the measure creates three contribution periods that means 
that means an individual contributor can give a candidate 3000 
over two calendar years 
in this election for example a candidate who began 
fundraising early could collect up to the limit from a particular 
contributor for the period from january through june of 1989 then 
the same person could again donate the limit for the fiscal year 
that ran from july 1989 through june 1990 and he could give again 
before the election in the fiscal year that began july 1 
critics say the fiscalyear format helps incumbents because they 
usually start raising funds earlier than challengers karlton 
agreed 
voters approved both propositions 68 and 73 in june 1988 but 73 
took effect because it got more votes however a few minor 
provisions of 68 also became law where they didnt conflict with 
prop 73 
some provisions of the competing measure proposition 68 also 
took effect including one that limits contributions in races for 
the state legislature if the court decision isnt suspended or 
reversed the political commission will enforce those limits larson 
said

the un security council ordered an air embargo of iraq on 
tuesday and warned of worse to come unless iraq quits kuwait the 
vote was 141 with only cuba opposed and extended the powers of 
an earlier un trade embargo 
us secretary of state james a baker iii cautioned acts 
have consequences for international society to permit iraq 
to overwhelm a small neighbor and to erase it from the map would 
send a disastrous message 
iraqi ambassador abdul alanbari who had been attending as an 
interested party stalked out after the vote saying boycotting a 
country by enforcing a naval embargo as well as an air embargo is 
an act of aggression an act of war 
he said iraq has been practicing selfrestraint because we 
know that if war were to break out it would destroy everything in 
the region 
soviet foreign minister eduard shevardnadze who presided at the 
special council meeting said war was an option if not a desirable 
one but i hope that peaceful ways will be found to find a way 
out 
earlier shevardnadze joined a world chorus of rage and 
indignation against iraq calling the lightning takeover of kuwait 
an act of terrorism and warning of possible un military 
action 
echoing a growing pessimism over the possibility of a diplomatic 
solution soon shevardnadze warned a great war may break out in 
the gulf region any day any moment 
the painful economic impact of the invasion which left saddam 
husseins iraq in control of 20 percent of the worlds oil 
reserves grew more apparent 
crude oil prices approached 40 a barrel nearly double the 
price before the aug 2 blitzkrieg some us analysts said tuesday 
in new york that gas prices may exceed 2 a gallon if a shooting 
war breaks out in the persian gulf they said the fallout will be 
widespread if oil prices should stay high for long running up the 
cost of practically everything while slowing economic growth 
the new york stock exchange has sunk to a 14month low and gold 
has passed 400 an ounce 
president bush appealed on tuesday for a generous response 
from the world community for countries hardest hit by the crisis 
he spoke at the annual meeting in washington of the international 
monetary fund 
world bank president barber conable on tuesday outlined 
emergency plans to help resettle hundreds of thousands of refugees 
fleeing iraq and kuwait 
the us defense department meanwhile reported new buildups of 
iraqi troops and armor in southern iraq and kuwait within striking 
distance of saudi arabia and its vast oil fields pentagon 
spokesman pete williams said about 430000 iraqi soldiers now are 
in the area up from 360000 last week 
he said iraqi deployments still seemed to be essentially a 
defensive force but could readily convert to offense 
saddam showed no sign of yielding he said in a message to 
americans broadcast tuesday that bush was sending americans to a 
war more terrible than vietnam 
in a rambling 75minute address taped last week saddam warned 
that if bush were to launch war against iraq it would not be up 
to him to end it 
he repeatedly accused bush and kuwaits rulers of plotting to 
impoverish iraq and steal its oil 
bush ladies and gentlemen is sending your sons to war for no 
purpose save fatal arrogance the iraqi president said 
he spoke in arabic with english subtitles supplied by iraqi 
authorities 
security council resolution 670 sks all states to prevent use 
of airspace by any passenger or cargo flight to or from iraq or 
occupied kuwait except for approved mercy missions 
it bans use of force but calls for searches and detention of 
aircraft it calls for halting iraqi shipping and freezing iraqi 
assets overseas 
the air embargo was one more step to completely isolate iraq a 
naval force is currently enforcing the trade embargo 
the council said it would consider serious action if iraq 
continued to defy the will of the international community hinting 
at a un military operation it said countries that evade the un 
embargo against iraq may themselves face secondary sanctions 
the resolution was the ninth passed by the security council 
condemning iraq over kuwait

attending from among the councils 15 member states 
syrian president hafez assad meanwhile ended his fourday visit 
to the iranian capital tehran having failed to persuade iranian

saddam has said he would rather go to war than let the 
unordered embargo strangle his country 
on tuesday baghdad announced it would put bush on trial for 
crimes against the peoples of the world and it set a date 
oct 15 
shevardnadze suggested the same should be done to saddam 
he told the general assembly that people who take hostages use 
torture threaten nations with destruction and are guilty of 
particular ruthlessness in the use of force should be tried by an 
international tribunal for their crime against humanity 
saddam has threatened to destroy israel and has detained 
thousands of westerners moving some to strategic sites to serve as 
shields against potential western attack 
the soviet foreign minister noted that the united nations has 
the power to suppress acts of aggression there is ample evidence 
that this right can be exercised he said adding that such a 
step should come only after peaceful nonmilitary options have 
been exhausted 
although the soviets have not joined the usled multinational 
force amassing in the gulf they have said they might be willing to 
participate in a un military effort provided they share 
command

reached 21970

portauprince haiti ap after scrapping together funds and 
convincing politicians it is safe to campaign haitis electoral 
council set dec 16 as the date for presidential and municipal 
elections an official said tuesday 
the elections have been postponed several times they were last 
set for nov 4 but the electoral council had to drop that date 
because the impoverished government couldnt provide the money to 
organize the voting 
last week the haitian government came up with 4 million the 
government will get an additional 15 million through the un 
development program and the us government west germany and 
france have made pledges as well 
jean casimir who heads the electoral council said the canadian 
government confirmed paper to be used for ballots would arrive in 
haiti the first week of november without canadas contribution of 
the costly imported paper the election date could not be set he 
said 
many leading politicians had refused until recent days to 
participate in any elections organized by interim president ertha 
pascaltrouillot who was appointed in march they claimed she was 
unable to control the corrupt and violenceprone military 
but several prominent parties announced monday they had decided 
to participate because of haitis weak democratic tradition there 
did not appear to be a frontrunner in the election 
the presidentelect will be sworn in feb 7 1991 the fifth 
anniversary of the fall of the dictator jean claude duvalier the 
duvalier family ruled haiti for almost three decades 
in 1987 the last attempt at free elections collapsed when thugs 
supported by the army shot and hacked to death at least 34 voters 
since its independence from france in 1804 haiti has been ruled 
mainly by dictators

the marine corps has grounded four harrier jet 
fighterbombers similar to those sent to the persian gulf because 
of faulty sensors that stabilize the aircraft the service said 
tuesday 
the vertical takeoff av8b planes were found to have defective 
rate sensor assemblies a system which includes three 
gyroscopes and provides direction information for the jet said 
col stuart wagner 
its not critical to flying the aircraft safely but its 
something we want to fix wagner said of the assemblies similar 
to the power steering on a car 
the rate sensor assemblies are wearing out faster than expected 
he said 
wagner said the grounded harriers were based at kaneohe bay 
marine corps air station in hawaii but tuesday night the defense 
department said no harriers were based there 
the defense department spokesman army maj mike dibble said he 
was unable to determine immediately where the grounded planes were 
the action has no effect on the harriers deployed in saudi 
arabia as part of the us military buildup against iraq wagner 
said 
the announcement on the grounding came as the house government 
operations subcommittee on legislation and national security again 
examined procurement and testing irregularities by northrop corp 
involving the harrier jet and advanced cruise missile 
northrop pleaded guilty in february to 34 fraud charges and 
agreed to pay 17 million in fines which according to the justice 
department is the largest criminal fine ever imposed on a defense 
contractor 
the charges stemmed from northrops work on the harrier and the 
nucleararmed airlaunched cruise missile the navy which handles 
procurement for the marine corps suspended northrup from further 
contracts and recommended a suspension from all defense work the 
air force however is buying b2 stealth bombers made by northrup 
testimony before the house panel tuesday detailing the 
procurement and testing irregularities was similar to what the 
justice department told a house energy and commerce subcommittee in 
july 
witnesses tuesday described how northrop never performed life 
expectancy tests on the rate sensor assemblies 
the assemblies were supposed to have undergone a vibration test 
at 32 times the acceleration imparted by gravity but instead were 
tested at half that acceleration they also were to have been 
operated continuously for 4000 hours to determine life expectancy 
we decided that it would cost too much to perform this test at 
an outside lab howard hyde a former chief engineer with 
northrop who is serving a oneyear sentence for falsifying tests on 
the harrier jet said of the vibration tests 
no spare sensor assemblies are available forcing the marines to 
park the 22 million planes as problems arise no other company 
produces the assemblies 
the marine corps officer for the harrier program told the panel 
that it has waived the suspension against northrop to buy a package 
of spare rate sensor assemblies for 300000 
col james hart said the service is working out a contract with 
another manufacturer that will likely cost 1 million 
who will supply the new rate sensor assembly components to the 
the harriers back off the ground the corporation that bilked us to 
begin with complained rep john conyers dmich chairman of 
the government operations subcommittee 
it looks like business as usual for northrop it has a corner 
on the market and national security needs override all other 
considerations 
the marine corps has nearly 200 harriers made by 
mcdonnelldouglas corp under license from a british manufacturer 
the harriers needing no runway to take off can be based in 
forest clearings and other unorthodox places to provide close 
support and air cover for marine units 
their swiveling jet exhaust nozzles give them outsanding 
maneuverability in the air that enabled british pilots to dominate 
their argentine opponents in the 1982 falklands war

the un security council voted 141 
tuesday to impose an air embargo against iraq in an effort to force 
iraqi occupying forces to quit kuwait iraqs envoy called it an 
act of war 
the council warned baghdad it may take further punitive action 
and hinted at sanctions against nations that fail to observe un 
measures against iraq 
cuba cast the only vote opposing resolution 670 which directs 
all states to bar use of airspace by any passenger or cargo flight 
to or from iraq or occupied kuwait except for approved mercy 
missions 
iraqi ambassador abdul alanbari who attended as an interested 
party stalked out after the vote saying you know boycotting a 
country by enforcing a naval embargo as well as an air embargo is 
an act of aggression an act of war 
but up to now we have been practicing selfrestraint because 
we know that if war were to break out it would destroy everything 
in the region 
soviet foreign minister eduard shevardnadze who presided said 
in response that even if this resolution is not observed there 
are certain other things that can be done short of war because 
this is not yet a full blockade of iraq 
shevardnadze said war is not a desirable option but it is one 
of the options contained in the un charter anyway i hope that 
peaceful ways will be found to find a way out 
he spoke in russian through a translator 
tuesday marked the ninth time the security council has condemned 
iraqs aug 2 invasion of kuwait and demanded immediate withdrawal 
the resolution prohibits use of force but calls for searches 
and detention of aircraft for halting iraqi shipping and freezing 
iraqi assets overseas 
the council warned it would consider serious action if iraq 
continued to flout international will hinting at a un military 
operation it said countries that evade the un embargo against 
iraq may themselves face secondary sanctions 
at a breakfast meeting with journalists tuesday british foreign 
secretary douglas hurd remarked i dont see much in the way of 
next steps except against sanctionsbusters 
the presence of 13 foreign ministers among the councils 15 
member states underscored the determination of the international 
community to compel iraq to quit kuwait 
un spokesman francois giuliani said it was the first time in 
the united nations 45year history so many foreign ministers 
attended a meeting to vote on a substantive issue 
on only three previous occasions have the foreign ministers of 
all five permanent members the united states the soviet union 
britain china and france attended a security council meeting 
rarely has the international community been so united and 
determined that aggression should not succeed us secretary of 
state james a baker iii told the council 
iraq has been quarantined because its brutal actions have 
separated it from the community of nations there can be no 
business as usual in fact there can be no economic exchanges with 
iraq at all 
the security council earlier adopted a trade embargo against 
iraq that includes a ban on air traffic the new resolution makes 
the air embargo explicit and gives states the power to enforce it 
cuba has said it is against any sanctions on iraq 
earlier resolutions authorized ships to implement a maritime 
embargo and to stop and search vessels that may be violating trade 
sanctions 
other resolutions repudiated the annexation of kuwait demanded 
the release of hostages and condemned iraqi raids on foreign 
missions in kuwait 
baker warned each day that iraqi officials flout norms of 
elementary decency makes it that much more difficult for iraq to 
resume its place in the international community 
the resolution did not spell out the mechanics of 
implementation diplomats said lawyers would be studying the text 
baker said the council puts iraq on notice that continued 
failure to obey the international community could lead to further 
action under chapter 7 of the un charter which provides for un 
military intervention 
shevardnadze said earlier this iraqi invasion is a major 
affront to mankind the united nations has the power to 
suppress acts of aggression there is ample evidence that this 
right can be exercised it will be if the illegal occupation of 
kuwait continues 
the foreign ministers of all but cuba and the ivory coast 
attended 
beside the five permanent members with veto power the council 
includes canada colombia cuba ethiopia finland ivory coast 
malaysia romania yemen and zaire

the schools chancellor is preparing a plan to 
distribute condoms to students through health clinics in 20 junior 
high and high schools a city official said tuesday 
we see this as an effective preventive measure for pregnancy 
and in slowing the spread of aids said carmen rivera director 
of the mayors office of health policy we see both these things 
as in crisis proportions in certain communities 
a spokesman for chancellor joseph fernandez said the plan was 
still being formed 
but ms rivera said the condoms would be distributed through the 
20 clinics which also offer examinations and other services to 
tens of thousands of students 
the school system briefly distributed condoms through the 
clinics in 1986 but stopped the program because of opposition from 
several board of education members 
the school clinics referred students seeking contraceptives to 
private physicians and other clinics 
ms rivera said most of the seven school board members now 
support the plan 
james vlasto the chancellors spokesman said fernandez had 
asked the city health commissioner dr woodrow myers to speak to 
the board wednesday on health issues of young people 
the proposal has to come from the chancellor but it has to be 
a cooperative effort vlasto said

it starts with an anonymous soldier in a lookout post above a 
neighborhood in the occupied gaza strip he twists a radios dial 
to the station whose hebrew news and chatter along with american 
and israeli rock music will be almost the only sound for the 
films 28 minutes 
riklis camera shows the life of a palestinian family through 
the eyes of the brownhaired reservist in his late 20s 
he sees a palestinian father builds a pigeon coop atop his roof 
and his son sets free the birds on the street two soldiers 
confiscate a soccer ball from palestinian boys 
as the soldier looks down on the dusty streets in gaza the 
radio deejay brightly announces a day on the mediterranean we 
love the weather here 
the soldiers glance is drawn across the street to an old arab 
house built of stones with arched windows a 7yearold boy lives 
there and his teenage sister innocent and stunningly beautiful 
the girl knows she is being watched and seductively lingers near 
her window in his only descent from the lookout post the soldier 
walks by the house and encounters the girl they stare into each 
others eyes but do not speak 
when the girl marries a palestinian activist she changes her 
dark lush hair is covered by a scarf in moslem fashion the 
husband closes the bedroom window shutters blocking the soldiers 
view 
in the living room the family watches a television news report 
showing troops savagely beating arabs a youth unfurls a 
palestinian flag 
the soldiers sees the familys life but his only line in the 
movie i didnt see anything comes as troops raid the house 
and arrest the womans father 
in the gripping climax the womans husband sends her brother to 
deliver a package to the father as he returns from a military 
lockup an army patrol appears and the boy hurriedly tosses aside 
the package it explodes the boy dies before his fathers eyes 
now the lookouts passivity ends he stares at the boys limp 
body raises his rifle and kills the young husband 
in an eerie epilogue the palestinian woman paces her porch 
months later singing to her newborn child still watched by a 
lookout but the reservist is gone a different wideeyed soldier 
gazes on 
for israelis riklis film presents the unfamiliar world of 
palestinians in the gaza strip juxtaposed with the familiar chatter 
of an israeli radio show 
radio is almost the second voice of the nation it is still 
not a medium of entertainment here but taken very seriously 
said deejay dori benzeev whose show was on the soundtrack 
what the soldier sees is a story riklis said what he 
hears on the radio is reality i wanted to take a difficult 
situation and hit the audience with our indifference the events 
in the territories are the same only we get used to hearing them 
and they dont phase us anymore 
the film is more a mix of documentary with drama than two recent 
israeli films that focus on relations with palestinians 
green fields winner of the featurefilm award at the 1989 
jerusalem festival follows an israeli family on a destructive 
journey in the west bank one of ours israels entry in this 
years academy awards is about the slaying of a palestinian 
prisoner 
the stars of lookout are both young israelis uri 
ramklausner plays the soldier and esti yerushalmi is the 
palestinian girl the supporting cast is made up of israeli arabs 
from jaffa where the film was shot 
riklis got the idea for the film more than two years ago when 
the palestinian uprising was just starting but it took time to 
raise the money for the film 
unfortunately she said the issue has remained 
relevant

thanks to steve allen an entire generation soon 
will learn that the idea of hot young comedians doing live hip 
sketch comedy on a tv variety show is older than nbcs saturday 
night live 
at last another generation can wonder whether theres a fern in 
its creel on oct 1 ha the tv comedy network debuts the first 
of 100 halfhours from the steve allen show a live weekly 
variety show that ran headtohead against the ed sullivan show 
on sunday nights from 1956 to 1959 
elvis presley made his tv debut on the allen show but the 
program was known more for its daft inspired comedy by a troupe of 
brilliant comics that included don knotts louis nye tom poston 
pat harrington and allen himself 
we all had a kind of vibration of mutual craziness and 
creativity that first of all made our work pleasurable and 
secondly very effective allen said 
the show was a jumpingoff point for pop culture allens 
wordplay with the band smock smock smock and the casts 
doubletalk hows your fern on sunday night would echo in 
schools and businesses on monday 
for the record allen said he does not have a fern in his 
creel 
well i had it removed several years ago allen said but 
it didnt hurt much 
barumpbump 
when the sunday show started there were just three of us 
writing it stan burns herb sargent and myself allen said 
today a show like that would have literally 22 or 23 writers 
in four or five days we were putting together each week 
something that was literally on the level of a broadway musical 
comedy revue he said and yet we were so young and energetic 
and having such great fun we never even thought to complain about 
it 
believe it or not we were having such fun with it we never 
looked upon it as a burden it was hard work oh yeah but we loved 
it 
allen 67 is the author of 35 books three of them coming out 
this year and hes still one of americas most prolific popular 
music composers 
the ha shows came from his own collection 
i was saving them for my greatgrandchildren should they ever 
be curious as to what i did he said but a combination of 
economic and cultural factors has created a vacuum a market for 
the good comedy of that 1950 period 
the underlying sociological fact allen said is that todays 
generation is the first in human history to have been exposed to 
comedy since birth 
children are literally hearing group laughter and the verbal 
cues that occasion it as part of their early exposure to human 
language of any sort he said 
i think this must have something to do with the fact that when 
they get to be 5 and 6 and a little more discriminating they all 
expect comedy 
in an essay allen wrote back in the 50s for the atlantic 
monthly he remembers observing that there were only 50 comedians 
in show business 
just think the whole funny business was being taken 
care of by a little group that you could have fit on a school 
bus he said now we have over 2000 thats an explosive 
mushrooming growth 
many of todays comedy performers are funnier than the 
oldtimers no names of the oldtimers but that is not the 
problem what is highly objectionable now is the degree to 
which wit which was once characteristic of american comedy is 
being replaced by shock vulgarity 
vulgarity is creeping into tv comedy as well allen said 
viewers he said should try to induce a sense of guilt or shame in 
television executives who either are permitting or demanding 
shockvulgar tv shows 
even if it turned out that those who say hey dont knock it 
its the way to get ratings were right they still should be 
discouraged allen said 
somebody should still say to them does the condition of the 
national consciousness mean nothing to you is it all dollars and 
cents 
 
elsewhere in television 
pbs on home video dept theres a new label showing up in your 
local video store wednesday major retailers will be offering the 
pbs home video label featuring programs from nature this

women reporters covering the us 
military buildup in maledominated saudi arabia exulted when the 
invitation came to join female soldiers in their exercise classes 
exclusive we gloated 
but the chance to swim and sweat with the us women in uniform 
nearly backfired when the three reporters myself included 
walked through the front door of the 80 million gymnasium at a 
saudi air base 
several saudi custodians all men leapt up and followed us to 
the registration desk complaining loudly that we had violated 
custom by using the front entrance women they said must enter 
through the rear door 
our timing it appeared couldnt have been worse we had 
committed this faux pas on a friday islams holy day during 
moslem prayer time 
the saudis were not the only ones who were annoyed 
you nearly ruined it for all of us one angry air force nurse 
told the sheepish reporters they almost kicked us out 
the military women had fought hard for the privilege of using 
the gym three times a week and they dreaded the idea of losing it 
the culture clash was an example of the hidden challenges that 
american women encountered in saudi arabia a country where females 
dont vote dont drive dont go out in public without covering 
their faces and heads with veils dont socialize in meeting places 
and rarely hold jobs that bring them in contact with the general 
public 
most saudi women seem to accept the social structure that is 
based on the laws of islam they say they are put on a pedestal in 
their homes and treated generously by their men 
the female reporters writers television and radio 
correspondents photographers and television camera crews have 
been treated fairly by both saudi and american officials in terms 
of access to events and opportunities to cover the usled 
military deployment 
we have slept on cots in the desert with the 82nd airborne out 
of fort bragg nc we have visited egyptian paratroopers near the 
saudikuwaiti border interviewed the powerful saudi petroleum 
minister and toured the strategic petroleum refinery at ras 
tanura 
in deference to saudi custom we cover our arms wear longer 
skirts and keep bare skin to a minimum but none of us wear the 
black cloaks known as abayas or head coverings the heat argues 
against wearing stockings 
we act generally as we do in the united states eating in 
restaurants sipping coffee in the hotel lobbies but we remain 
oddities on the social scene the only women attending an arabian 
nights dinner under a big tent hosted by saudi prince for example 
we were warned about the muttawa the socalled religious police 
who enforce the islamic dress code and insist conservative 
standards are upheld but an informal survey indicated none of the 
reporters has been accosted by the muttawa who have the power to 
make arrests 
on the streets or in the souks markets our small cadre of 
female reporters has grown accustomed to sares from curious 
saudis but the incredulous looks did not interfere with work 
the major complaint and the biggest frustration is the ban 
on driving we must hire taxis drivers or rely on male colleagues 
to ferry us around an expensive inconvenience in a country with a 
modern system of interstate highways the us embassy also advised 
women not to sit next to a man to whom she was not married 
in one case i drove to a remote post on the saudikuwaiti 
border with a male colleague 300 miles from the coastal city of 
dhahran to meet with the governor of the province the trip would 
have been impossible without a male escort 
air travel was potentially a problem because saudi custom 
dictates women must be accompanied by a male relative expatriate 
women have to obtain a letter approving their travel from their 
sponsoring company airports have checkin lines designated for 
males and families 
saudi officials seemed to ignore the rules for the foreign 
reporters i was never asked about my marital status for instance 
when i flew to riyadh the saudi capital in the company of an 
american male reporter 
female reporters benefit from the famed saudi hospitality and 
generosity when one reporter mentioned she had lost a contact 
lens her host insisted on having his driver take her the next day 
to the clinic for a replacement 
at prince mohammed bin fahds daily majlis a combination of a 
town meeting and a magistrates court saudi citizens ask the 
governor of the eastern province to resolve problems ranging from 
land disputes to homelessness 
after meeting the prince i jokingly told himii had some 
problems he could solve pressed on what theywere i assured him i 
was only kidding 
that night i received a call from the princes worried press 
officer you mentioned you had some problems and the prince 
wanted to know if there was anything he could do the press 
officer said 
a car to take you shopping some interviews anything 
 
editors note joan mower a washington reporter for the 
associated press reported from saudi arabia for four weeks

this capital now boils with political 
activity as algeria undertakes an arabstyle transition toward 
democracy 
one question dominates will free elections in this north 
african country replace a marxiststyle dictatorship with an 
islamic one 
the potent brew of politics and religion bubbles to life each 
evening in the casbah where bearded young men sip mint tea and 
dissect democracy and the koran in a capital long derided as 
moscow on the med 
vive fis long live the islamic salvation front reads 
the graffiti on the ketchaoua mosque a bastion of algerias most 
potent political movement 
this is a moslem country said ali hamidouche 32 its 
only natural that people would want a moslem government 
the 28 political parties and lively free press born since 
constitutional rforms in 1989 contrast sharply with an arab world 
ruled by monarchs dictators and oneparty states 
but vows by islamic councils elected last june to impose koranic 
law fuel fears that the democratic experiment may be short 
if the fis wins were dead a leading womens rights 
activist said 
the islamic salvation front took control of more than half the 
countrys municipal and regional councils june 12 in algerias 
first free elections since independence from france in 1962 
the verdict repudiated the ruling national liberation front 
fln and its 28year monopoly on power 
but local councils hold little power the fundamentalists cannot 
effect changes while the fln holds all seats in the national 
assembly 
their complaints forced president chadli bendjedid to move 
legislative elections ahead a year to next spring 
no matter who wins the first success of these elections will 
be stability and legitimacy for the national assembly fis leader 
abassi madani said in a recent newspaper interview 
the 59yearold philosophy professor presents the moderate face 
of a movement encompassing classical scholars and proiranian 
radicals 
his alter ego is ali belhadj 31 whose fiery speeches attract 
thousands he blames infidels france chief among them for 
algerias woes 
for the young men outside the ketchaoua mosque the fis heralds 
an end to the sovietinspired system the national liberation front 
imposed on algeria one of the continents largest countries and 
situated on the mediterranean 
the fundamentalists message is clear the old regime was 
corrupt it brought poverty and unemployment an islamic regime 
will stop corruption and thereby social problems 
the fis vows to end to secular practices that let men and women 
mingle at school and work 
for us secularism means liberty from god hamidouche said 
with a grimace 
ranged against the fundamentalists are dozens of political 
groupings but only a handful with significant support 
the fln remains the best organized thousands of its adherents 
run the public sector to which most algerians owe their livelihood 
but the fln managed only to win a quarter of the june vote 
theyll be lucky to keep 25 percent next time a western 
diplomat said people are fed up and theyve thrown up no young 
charismatic leader 
the oppostion includes the liberal rally for culture and 
democracy the centrist front for socialist forces and the populist 
movement for democracy in algeria 
the rally received a boost when the other two parties boycotted 
the june voting claiming the fln would rig the results their 
leaders are heroes of the war for independence berber chief 
hocine ait ahmed and algerias first president ahmed ben bella 
ben bella 73 is the man algerians are watching he hopes to 
weld a democratic consensus to lead the country out of its 
economic ills 
ben bellas stature is unrivaled by any living algerian he 
planned the 1954 uprising against france and ruled three years 
after independence until toppled in a military coup 
half his life has been spent in exile or prison he currently 
lives in geneva though a return to algiers is considered imminent 
they never broke him said hocine guermouche spokesman for 
the movement for democracy in algeria 
youve seen mandela he spent 27 years in prison and never 
lost his spirit ben bella has done more he won the war 
but he also gave algeria ills it is only now shaking off secret 
police a singleparty system a marxist economy 
whoever wins next years elections will struggle to revive the 
sagging economy 
in october 1988 thousands of algerians rioted over living 
standards that plummeted along with prices for the countrys chief 
export oil 
scores of people including many fundamentalists died when the 
army crushed the uprising the deaths robbed the fln of popular 
legitimacy 
bendjedid whose term expires in 1993 distanced the government 
from the fln and drafted last years constitutional reforms he 
appointed technocrats to impose market economics 
no party seems likely to meddle with the privatization program 
but the pace of economic change remains slow 
unemployment officially stands at 25 percent families of 12 
often live in tworoom apartments the government estimates 800000 
new dwellings are needed 
long lines form at shops often empty of basic foodstuffs 
jobless young men survive by hawking blackmarket cigarettes 
strikes proliferate 
as the meuzzin at ketchaoua mosque called the faithful to 
prayer one young man said lots of political parties are fine as 
long as they adhere to islam 
if the people vote for the fis fine if they vote for 
some other party and they win thats good too said boumari 
nacer edde a casbah candy seller 
the important thing is that theres democracy we want 
democracy

it was 1130 am when rude laughter and the 
whoosh of rushingwater sundered deborah terrells algebra lesson 
the odds against the lesson already were high enough for ms 
terrell and her 19 eighthgraders at burnet street elementary 
school a magnet school where 200 of 500 children are homeless 
this day like most ms terrell has spent here for the last 
decade would be a melange of frustration fatigue selfdoubt and 
perhaps a small victory or two 
but as she spoke of equations a former student in a prankish 
mood gleefully sprayed the glass in her classroom door with jets 
from the hallway fire extinguishers 
see that she said pointing angrily to the truant this 
is fun what kind of life is that 
later that day as if sent to restore her faith a second 
visitor dropped in tawana woolridge a prim polite 12thgrader at 
newarks tough central high whom ms terrell had taught five years 
earlier 
she was my favorite teacher tawana said she wasnt too 
strict but she didnt let you get away with anything either 
when one kid like that comes back and is making it thats 
what makes it all worthwhile said the teacher 
 
3 pm at last 
most of the students leaving room 303 headed for baxter terrace 
or other downtown newark housing projects three caught buses for 
homeless shelters at the lincoln or carlton hotels 
ms terrell slumped back in her chair exhausted 
she hadnt always wanted to be a teacher she studied psychology 
at rutgers university but quickly lost her taste for it after an 
internship at a mental health center too depressing 
when i went to school everyone wanted to be a teacher i came 
here to burnet to do my student teaching the seventhgrade teacher 
left one day and the principal just gave me her class the rest is 
history 
at age 36 her chosen career now earns her about 33000 a year 
i dont see myself here for another 10 years but i guess i 
wonder if i leave whos going to be here for these kids 
later back home in her neat woodframe house on a 
toughlooking downtown newark street shed make sure her sons 
malcolm 8 and toussaint 9 buckled down to homework as her own 
mother once had for her 
but now as the last pupil straggled out she needed to 
decompress 
i have to wind down before i can see my kids she said if 
i dont take half an hour to wind down i might take things out on 
them 
after dinner homework awaited grading neatly bound projects 
her students had prepared on the evils of drugs to mark national 
drug awareness month then she planned to phone parents to exhort 
them to attend open school night 
she wondered aloud am i just speaking to the air did anyone 
learn anything today 
she thought 
well i know murad learned something 
murad a bright cocky reedthin boy is quick with excuses and 
short on study habits ms terrell had forced him to sit in a desk 
alongside hers a spot known in her class as out of society 
but today murad actually had taken notes in class and used them 
to solve a math problem 
a small victory 
and ronald a big day for him too quiet withdrawn homeless 
for the last year ronald had stood up for the first time and given 
an oral presentation the class had applauded ronald had smiled 
shyly 
another victory 
victories come hard at burnet street designated four years ago 
a magnet school for homeless children in kindergarten through 
eighthgrade only last year did the board of education add staff 
and resources to help the school accommodate this most troubled 
population teachers say they have yet to get any formal training 
on how to deal with them 
kids wre sleeping on desks had to meet bus schedules had to 
make stops at the grocery stores ms terrell said 
average daily attendance at burnet street is just 876 percent 
the national average is more than 92 percent twenty percent at 
burnet need special help with basic skills and 15 percent have 
been held back a grade or more only 5 percent of parents 
participate in school activities according to new jersey state 
statistics 
for ms terrell teaching is a daily gantlet of delays 
interruptions excuses 
the pa system squawks messages the bell rings every 45 minutes 
in the space of a morning the attendance teacher knocks on the 
door to take roll four hispanic students get pulled out of class 
for special english classes eight others are summoned for remedial 
classes to boost low english and math test scores still another 
group goes for computer instruction in the afternoon ms 
terrells homeless students are called away early to catch buses to 
shelters 
and then there are the excuses 
a kid tells her she didnt do her homework because i left the 
book in school ok 
at that ms terrells mouth twists upward in a streetwise curl 
that says without words you think i havent heard that nonsense a 
thousand times before you think youre kidding me i was raised in 
the same streets you were 
no she finally says thats not ok you know how i feel 
about excuses and thats not even a good one and get rid of the 
gum 
she has a way of mixing humor affection and discipline on her 
desk is a small sign u toucha my desk i breaka u face 
sometimes shell say with a hint of a smile you know how 
unrational i am 
how do the kids feel about her 
defiant yet dependent she sometimes invites her students to 
write what they think without signing their papers they write her 
things they wouldnt tell their parents about drugs aids their 
neighborhoods being homeless 
 
her kids say ms terrell sometimes gets teary during her life 
lectures when she speaks about what she wants for them why 
shes there 
one such talk comes minutes after the classs standardized state 
test scores arrive 
the 7th grade scores the ones her kids took the spring before 
show only 28 percent testing above average in math the lowest 
passing rate in the school by far 
oh brother she says were the lowest on the list 
everyone has so much time to talk and play talk and play 
what bothers me is i know you can do better these scores are 
garbage thats a reflection on me whatever i have to do to get 
this up i will do 
you always should expect to do the best for yourself theres 
too much potential in this room im just here to help you but you 
have to help me help you you already have the strikes against you 
youre minorities blacks puerto ricans so people look at these 
scores and say what did you expect 
i know where you belong and i want to take you i certainly 
dont want any of you in here next year shooting fire extinguishers 
at the window

el grecos hometown is holding its first 
major exhibit of paintings by its most famous son celebrating his 
450th birthday a year early 
domenicos theotocopoulos as the artist was born and as he 
signed his work is represented by 30 paintings five early 
byzantine icons and by a wealth of documents and books illuminating 
his life 
he died in toledo spain in 1614 it was there that the 
visionary artist became known as el greco the greek and created 
his mannerist masterpieces 
his flamelike lines brightly lighted figures and elongated 
distorted forms depicting religious ecstasy and ascetic nobility 
have been brought to his hometown on crete for the first time ever 
they are on display at the basilica of st mark 
although it is believed that theotocopoulos was born in 1541 
iraklion held his 450th anniversary a year early 
we guessed that next year major museums will be holding their 
own exhibitions and we wouldnt be able to get any paintings we 
wanted to get in first said nicos hadjinicolaou professor of 
art history at the university of crete who spent two years 
organizing the exhibition 
for cretans the exhibition of el grecos work and life has 
become a source of pride with over 2500 people flocking to it 
each day since it opened sept 1 it runs until oct 10 
a fiveday international congress on his life and work pointed 
out the greek and byzantine influences in el grecos work and 
illuminated aspects of his life in crete 
iraklion was a busy port called candia controlled by the 
venetian republic when theotocopoulos left in about 1570 to study 
under titian in italy 
the town does not own a single painting by its most famous son 
but it certainly remembers him overlooking the basilica square in 
which a large crowd gathered for the exhibitions inauguration is 
the huge neon sign of the el greco hotel further away is the 
theotocopoulos hotel 
the atmosphere at the exhibition is very interesting we see 
people here who have never been to an exhibition said 
hadjinicolaou in an interview 
it is a symbolic honor by us to a young artist who lived and 
worked here before making a great career abroad we owe it to 
honor someone who honors us he said 
the costs were borne by private donors and the municipality in 
this town of about 100000 people hadjinicolaou would not specify 
what they were 
when the carefully wrapped paintings began arriving from museums 
in washington and leningrad crowds gathered and applauded every 
time a crate was lowered from a truck 
irene florou a historian at the athens school of fine arts 
believes that the exhibition could inspire cretans and remind them 
of the flowering of art and literature the island experienced in 
the 16th and 17th centuries 
at that time painters such as theotocopoulos and mihalis 
damaskinos picked up the byzantine tradition writers such as 
vincenzios kornaros and giorgos hortatzis wrote venetianinspired 
epics that are sung to this day in the distinctive cretan dialect 
in remote villages 
this exhibition creates a counterbalance to the general 
climate of the time florou said in an interview people will 
be reminded that there is more to life than buying cars and 
building hotels they will remember the arts that they carry about 
inside them 
crete is currently enjoying an unprecedented economic boom with 
high european community subsidies for agriculture and construction 
of hotels touting the mediterranean islands beauty 
hadjinicolaou says that the town hopes to find a way to gather 
850000 pounds 16 million to buy el grecos view of mount 
sinai and the monastery of st catherine currently in a private 
collection in vienna 
fortunately both candidates for mayor in the october 
municipal elections support our effort he said 
the first major congress on el greco was held in toledo in 1982 
no greeks were invited to it and there was no mention of the greek 
side of his life and work the second such gathering was held at 
iraklions harbor fortress last month 
this was a small reply to their el greco of toledo our 
catalog is called el greco of crete a quarter of the speeches 
concerned el grecos cretan period hadjinicolaou said 
most of el grecos work in crete was on icons 
one of the major results of the congress was that participants 
appeared to have accepted the authenticity of an icon found on the 
aegean island of syros bearing domenicos theotocopoulos signature 
it was discovered in 1983 and would have been painted when the 
artist was in his early 20s

members of the heavy metal band judas priest 
would like to put the recent past behind them but theyre not 
about to change their tune 
the band is recovering from a recent nevada court battle which 
questioned whether subliminal messages exist on their 1978 album 
stained class and ultimately prompted two young men to enter a 
suicide pact 
lead singer rob halford and guitarist glenn tipton said their 
court victory clearing them of deliberately placing the subliminal 
messages on the album was bittersweet but theyre not about to 
quit making the music theyve been driven to make for the past 16 
years 
we wont back down to that kind of legal terrorism said 
tipton the priests new harddriving album painkiller and 
upcoming tour demonstrate their tenacity 
the band was cleared on aug 24 by washoe county district court 
judge jerry carr who ruled the plaintiffs alleged subliminal 
message do it on the song better by you better than me 
was an unintentional exhalation of breath and a drum beat 
we were fighting a case on an issue based on something that 
doesnt exist we had to sit in court while they were discussing 
freudian theories on subconscious levels and whether the 
subconscious mind could pick up subaudible signals and act upon 
it said tipton we had to sit through that when all the time 
we wanted to just stand up and say but there are no messages 
raymond belknap 18 died from a selfinflicted shotgun blast to 
the face on dec 23 1985 james vance then 20 shot himself also 
he lived but suffered horrible facial disfigurement and died in 
1988 of complications from his injuries and a reaction to 
medications both had listened to stained class before making 
the suicide pact 
their families sued judas priest and cbs records for 62 
million in damages claiming the subliminal messages were on the 
album and influenced their sons actions 
defense lawyers however countered that the youths came from 
troubled homes and had been drinking and smoking marijuana that 
day 
the judge did order cbs records to pay the plaintiffs 40000 
for refusing to comply with discovery orders involving the original 
master tape of the album 
both halford and tipton recently in new york before three weeks 
of rest in england and spain said they were sorry the young men 
died but the band was the unnecessary scapegoat for the tragedy 
people try and shoulder the burden of guilt on any one elses 
shoulders they should look a little closer to home for the real 
issues and the real reasons that cause incidents like this 
tipton said 
halford added that it was ridiculous to place the blame on the 
band or the music he said at times during the court battle he felt 
it was heavy metal on trial not just judas priest 
theres absolutely never been and never will ever be any 
scientific proof evidential that heavy metal music or any kind of 
music can physically make somebody to do something or change or 
be someone else 
socalled backwardmasking or conveying a subliminal 
message by recording it backward also became a wellpublicized 
issue in the trial 
halford testified on the stand he had put a backward message on 
one judas priest song but it was not on the album or song cited by 
the plaintiffs and he disagreed that backward messages are 
masked to influence behavior 
no its not backwardmasking and thats the confusing issue 
about that when i made that statement in court the prosecution 
was jumping up and down in glee because they thought they won the 
trial halford said 
the fact is its just a sound effect its been going on 
since jimi hendrix and before him its a simple operation of 
recording an instrument a cymbal a guitar a voice backwards 
to create a sound effect its been going on for 30 or 40 years 
he added 
tipton agreed saying it was impossible to prove whether 
backward messages are effective 
in the whole history of there world there is not one instance 
thats been proven that anybody can interpret anything backwards 
particularly something below audible level he said 
halford 39 wearing a tshirt imprinted with the words free 
speech formed from the american flag is the groups primary 
lyricist 
he said that although judas priest is known for 
noholdsbarred heavy metal hes never written lyrics that are 
obscene or advocate satanism or violence 
thats whats so ludicrous about the whole controversy 
supposedly surrounding this band halford said 
tipton agreed weve never condoned the use of drugs or 
alcohol or doing bad things 
although the band does use words such as hell and damn 
on the newrelease painkiller the words are not used in a 
violent manner 
it depends on how these words are used we dont say take 
these babies down into hell and kill them its like hells a hot 
place the word hell is used but its not used in what i would 
consider a bad or influential way tipton said 
judas priest which includes halford tipton kk downing ian 
hill and scott travis will go on the road in october with their 
new album the worldwide tour starts in canada moves into the 
united states in november and ends up in europe next year 
judas priest is one of the founding fathers of modernday heavy 
metal known for cultivating the leather studs and motorcycle look 
in heavy metal the band has cut 14 albums 
although judas priest has been around longer than many in its 
genre halford says competition with younger groups is no longer an 
issue with the band 
what ive noticed in the past few years particularly in heavy 
metal is that the substance is the most important issue now its 
not how much hair youve got and how pretty you look its the 
validity of your work he said

pvt manuel zepeda squinting through swollen eyes his face 
bloodied by shrapnel from a grenade ran to the waiting ship so 
did another soldier carrying on his back pvt santos alfaro badly 
wounded in the head and arm by the same explosion 
the aircraft was on the ground less than a minute torruella 
revved the turbojet engine and raced off before the aircraft 
reached safety beyond the range of enemy fire medic cpl tomas 
vasquez had a needle in alfaros arm and plasma dripping into his 
veins 
the grupo de helicopteros at ilopango air base five miles east 
of san salvador embodies the single most significant tactical 
advantage government forces have over the fmln leftist rebel army 
military analysts consider the infusion of helicopters and pilot 
training provided by washington from 198285 crucial in preventing 
the farabundo marti national liberation front from winning the 
civil war 
the fleet provides transport of troops and supplies rocket and 
machinegun support for ground troops and evacuation of nearly all 
the wounded government soldiers 
according to casualty statistics no job in the military is as 
dangerous as that of the squadrons 60 pilots during the past 18 
months it has become more so 
the guerrillas since early 1989 have worked diligently on 
antiaircraft tactics virtually all the approximately 65 aging 
hueys and the few newer hughes 500s making up the squad have been 
hit by ground fire 
several perhaps a dozen have been shot out of the sky the 
precise number is classified 
thirty pilots have been killed in action since the group was 
formed in 1982 most of the survivors have been wounded part of 
torruellas right foot was shot off in august 1989 when rifle fire 
pierced the floor 
charcoal portraits of 26 of those killed adorn a wall of the 
lobby of the groups headquarters once the four pending portraits 
are added there will be space for only two more before room will 
have to made on another wall 
the air force jealously guards information on rebel 
effectiveness against its planes and helicopters but by way of 
indication on both days an ap correspondent and photographer 
accompanied crews on medivac missions at least one ship was 
struck by gunfire 
most of the time damage is limited to perforations of the 
fuselage but if 762mm fire from guerrilla ak47s strikes the 
engine the tail rotor or hydraulic hoses the helicopter may crash 
or be forced to land off base 
rene a guerrilla squad leader based on the slopes of 
guazapa mountain 20 miles north of san salvador sat in the shade 
one recent afternoon and described triangulation the tactic 
concentrates fire of up to 15 aks on helicopters descending to 
either pick up wounded or deliver supplies 
the circling and dipping practiced by the pilots are intended to 
minimize guerrilla efficiency 
if you approach in a straight line they get a bead on you 
said torruella a smoothfaced 24yearold like several of the 
squads members he looks out of uniform more like an adolescent 
than a combat chopperjockey 
all the pilots except one a recent graduate of the local 
aviation school were trained at the us armys fort rucker in 
alabama 
they have the same training as us pilots that instruction 
combined with constant combat has made them among the best in the 
world practice makes perfect said lt col arch kielly us 
air force attache in el salvador 
military analysts say the air force especially the helicopter 
squadron was essential to beating back novembers largescale 
guerrilla offensive 
the fmln accused the government of indiscriminate rocket fire 
and strafing of densely populated urban neighborhoods where 
guerrillas had dug in 
air force authorities and us advisors dispute the allegation 
saying dozens of requests from ground troops for air support were 
denied for fear of inflicting unacceptable civilian casualties 
judging from what reporters saw during the offensive and from 
inspections of battlescarred neighborhoods afterward the truth is 
somewhere between the government and guerrilla claims 
aerial machinegun fire perforated roofs in several areas and 
rockets were launched into a few residential districts but intense 
use of air power appeared to have begun on the offensives fourth 
day when most civilians had evacuated the battle zones 
with the insurgents talking of a new offensive in coming weeks 
the pilots face a new peril the rebels reported acquisition of 
scores of shoulderfired surfacetoair missiles could prove to be 
a strategic watershed in the nearly 11yearold war 
employment of similar weapons in the 1980s by usbacked afghan 
guerrillas was one of the keys to the success of their campaign 
against soviet forces

the burst of repression expected to 
follow this summers election victory by islamic fundamentalists 
hasnt materialized 
take the case of tipasa this mediterranean resort welcomes tens 
of thousands of european and algerian tourists a year to pristine 
beaches and extensive roman ruins 
not long after the 15000 residents elected a council dominated 
by the islamic salvation front fis posters went up announcing a 
ban against shorts 
the news quickly reaching europe was portrayed as evidence the 
fundamentalists knew no limits in imposing strict morality how 
could shorts be banned in a beach town 
the impression of firebreathing fundamentalists imposing a 
draconian crackdown killed the season 
june and july were just dead there were almost no 
europeans ahmed mansour remarked on the empty terrace of his 
restaurant 
but town administrator mohammed essamelli says the reality of 
the ban was more complicated 
first this laws been here since 1965 said essamelli 
all the new council did was say they intended to enforce it 
second the law does not affect tipasas beaches where men and 
women in western swimwear outnumber those in long robes 20 to one 
it covers only the town center and was modeled on similar rules 
on the french riviera 25 years ago essamelli said 
the law permits shorts in town if they reach the top of the knee 
for men or the bottom of the knee for women essamelli finds this 
reasonable 
mansour notes that no police officer has bothered to enforce the 
ordinance and says the fundamentalists dont want to bite the 
economic hand that feeds the electorate 
nobody has come here asking us to stop selling alcohol he 
said they may be for islam but they know this country needs 
other things too 
the tipasa case finds echoes elsewhere stories proliferate of 
official crackdowns on ice cream and alcohol most turn out to be 
exaggerated 
many of the reports originate with the official aps news agency 
an organ of the ruling national liberation front the 
fundamentalists thrashed the party in the elections 
the fundamentalists certainly hope to change algerian society 
councils have moved to segregate boys and girls at school the 
movement debates whether women should work 
but in the absence of holding national power legislative 
elections are planned next spring the changes are mostly limited 
to cosmetics 
in oran algerias second city humor made a difference 
fundamentalist councilors there denounced a festival of the 
popular rai music which celebrates youthful revolt they said one 
devoted to islamic music would be better 
a rai singer responded with a number featuring a compromise 
refrain i voted for the fis i voted for the fis

asil nadir a turkishcypriot who built up his 
polly peck conglomerate over more than two decades is fighting a 
battle on two fronts as he tries to impede the erosion of the 
companys stock market value and his own business reputation 
the companys board of directors and the turkish government have 
rallied around the chairman and chief executive officer of polly 
peck a firm whose interests are as diverse as del monte pineapples 
and sansui stereos 
the companys shares dove 55 percent last thursday on rumors of 
a possible serious fraud office investigation into the company 
later that day nadir was interviewed by the office which 
investigates and prosecutes cases of serious fraud 
british newspaper reports in recent weeks have alleged the 
companys share price may have been supported illegally as was the 
case in the headlinemaking guinness scandal which resulted in a 
fiveyear prison term for the brewers former chairman 
the department of trade and industry is considering a request 
made sunday by polly pecks board for an independent inquiry into 
the conglomerates dealings a department spokeswoman said monday 
she was not identified in accordance with british practice 
trading in polly pecks shares a highflying stock of the 
1980s remained suspended monday londons stock exchange agreed to 
the companys request to halt trading thursday after the shares 
slumped by 135 pence 250 to 108 pence 2 
the exchange says it allows trading in a companys shares to be 
suspended pending an announcement by the company it says it does 
not impose a deadline for such an announcement but presses for one 
as quickly as possible 
nadir said in a letter to the trade department requesting the 
independent inquiry so intense and severe is the attack on 
myself that we on our own are unlikely to be able to find a fair 
hearing 
nadir also issued a statement sunday saying he would start legal 
proceedings for alleged defamation against times newspapers ltd 
and the observer ltd 
the newspapers reported sunday that a former polly peck 
executive has given information about polly peck activities to the 
serious fraud office 
after a board meeting friday polly pecks directors said it 
deplores the recent attacks on the chairman and that there 
would be a more detailed statement next week 
the turkish government has accused greek cypriots of a smear 
campaign against nadir a turkish foreign ministry spokesman 
recently said this ugly campaign begun at the instigation of 
greek cypriots was aimed at bringing the turkish cypriot republics 
economy to its knees 
nadir an ally of turkish president turgut ozal has extensive 
publishing and electronics interests in turkey and is the largest 
private employer in the turkishcontrolled part of cyprus 
polly pecks shares crashed once before in the early 1980s 
after greek cypriots claimed the company was exploiting land seized 
from greek cypriots after turkeys 1974 invasion divided the island 
in two the shares also were hurt because the companys earnings 
werent matching analysts forecasts 
the companys stock has fallen sharply since august when nadir 
who owns 28 percent of the companys shares said he wanted to take 
the company private and then withdrew the plan after five days the 
stock exchange criticized him for his hasty actions 
william de winton an analyst with the london investment firm 
hoare govett ltd said the company has been doing well the 
business is not in an untenable position as far as i can see they 
are going to have a relatively successful year he said 
polly pecks aftertax profit rose 16 percent last year 
nadir the son of a wealthy cypriot came to england in the 
1960s and set up his own clothing company in east london he then 
branched out into fruit distribution electronics and tourism 
in 1980 he took control of the ailing british textile company 
polly peck and used the firm as his stock market vehicle for 
expansion polly peck bought the del monte fresh fruit operations 
last year and control of sansui electric co in december 
in the process of building his company nadir became one of 
britains richest persons last year with a personal fortune valued 
at 213 million pounds 396 million that fortune is worth 
considerably less at todays market price

a judge has ordered the release of 
presentencing documents about michael milken which could provide 
revealing information about the convicted financier before his 
punishment is officially announced 
but the ruling monday by us district judge kimba wood said the 
released documents would be edited to delete possibly incriminating 
information about others 
she also left unclear whether milkens sentencing would proceed 
as scheduled oct 1 less than a week away 
her ruling was part of lastminute legal maneuvers surrounding 
the sentencing of milken the biggest and richest figure to fall in 
a federal crusade against securities fraud crimes that began in the 
late 1980s 
milken reversed claims of innocence in april pleaded guilty to 
six felonies and paid a record 600 million in fines and penalties 
to settle the biggest securities fraud case ever against a single 
person 
in the past few weeks prosecutors and defense attorneys have 
given wood exhaustive documents to guide her in determining a 
sentence for milken who faces a possible 28 years in prison 
news organizations sought copies of the documents before the 
sentencing date but milkens lawyers opposed an early release on 
grounds it could unfairly prejudice the sentencing 
i reject that contention theres no jury here wood told a 
hearing at manhatttan federal court delaying the release of the 
information she said may prejudice the ability of the press to 
understand it 
she ordered prosecutors to release edited versions of their 
sentencing memos that avoid references to other individuals or 
pending criminal investigations they were expected to be available 
later today 
defense lawyers declined to comment on woods ruling but said 
they would release similarly edited versions of their sentencing 
memos at about the same time 
although the documents are edited people familiar with the case 
said monday they could provide revealing insights into the scope of 
governments enormous case against milken as well as the depth of 
his defense 
milken is widely perceived as one of the most influential 
financiers in the 1980s who made a fortune by parlaying highrisk 
securities known as junk bonds into a 200 billion market 
although milken pleaded guilty to only six crimes related to 
securites and tax crimes prosecutors have been seeking to persuade 
the judge to consider a list of other illegal acts they say milken 
committed 
they have asked for an extraordinary hearing on this question 
which could delay milkens sentencing wood did not say whether she 
would grant such a hearing but asked assistant us attorney john 
carroll to provide examples of other cases in which similar 
hearings were requested 
the case against milken is by far the most important result of 
an intensive federal crackdown on securities fraud that surfaced 
nearly four years ago when stock speculator ivan boesky paid the 
government 100 million to settle charges of trading on inside 
information 
boeskys revelations led to numerous prosecutions and played a 
role in the downfall of milkens former employer drexel burnham 
lambert inc the oncefeared wall street powerhouse that is now 
out of business 
milken pioneered drexels use of junkbond financing for 
takeover deals and he had extensive and close links with a number 
of leading american investors and speculators

the city is threatening to pull the plug on 
commonwealth edison co which is reeling from recent power losses 
that blacked out thousands of residents and raised doubts about the 
utilitys dependability 
edisons problems come just as its trying to negotiate its 
first new franchise with chicago in 42 years 
the contract expires dec 31 but the city this month halted 
negotiations saying it wanted to extend the current deal another 
year while it figures out whether edison is dependable 
we cant bargain in the dark mayor richard m daley said 
recently 
edison hasnt said yet whether it will agree to the extension 
utility spokesman john hogan said comm ed would like to see the 
deal completed this year and that in any case its reliability is 
unimpeachable 
even if eependability werent an issue the city holds a wild 
card the option under the current franchise of buying comm eds 
facilities in the city 
other major us cities including los angeles have public 
utilities and some smaller cities have recently used franchise 
buyout clauses to purchase private utilities said deborah nuttall 
a spokeswoman for the washington dcbased american public power 
association 
but no large cities have made such a buyout in recent years she 
said 
edison is trying to salvage its image after a series of 
crippling blackouts including one in late july in which 40000 
west side customers were without electricity for three days some 
small stores were looted during the outage 
about a week later an outage cut off 25000 customers 
infuriating many people 
four less severe power failures have hit the city and suburbs in 
the past three days including two monday that briefly knocked out 
power to more than 2000 customers 
on saturday 15000 west side customers were without power for 
up to seven hours and on sunday a brief blackout hit about 2500 
south side customers 
other unrelated failures cut off power to the downtown area of 
the city of streeterville and the chicago board of trade where 
trading was suspended for about an hour last tuesday 
hogan said that because of the two major summer blackouts the 
media is reporting minor problems that previously would have been 
ignored 
edison has blamed the west side blackouts on a problem at a 
generating plant and other failures on damaged cables and animals 
chewing power lines 
still hogan said edison maintains a 9998 percent reliability 
factor 
we dont have any reason to believe the total infrastructure 
is in jeopardy hogan said 
even so the daley administration insists a buyout is a real 
alternative 
this is not a bargaining chip daley spokeswoman carolyn 
grisko said friday this is a possibility 
the current agreement gives the city the right to purchase comm 
eds system within the citys limits an option first given 
serious consideration in 1985 under the late mayor harold 
washingtons administration 
the utility serves 32 million customers in 25 counties of 
northern illinois 
other issues besides the buyout are on the table including how 
much money the utility pays the city for the right to operate here 
currently the utility pays chicago 4 percent of its gross receipts 
which last year was in excess of 72 million hogan said 
consumer groups such as citizens utility board are asking the 
city to consider a new franchise that would require commonwealth 
edison to work harder to cut customer costs 
residential commonwealth edison customers paid 107 cents per 
kilowatt hour for electricity in 1988 compared with a national 
average of 75 cents according to the power association 
edison financial analysts say the utility also has a lot to lose 
in the talks 
chicago represents a large portion of the companys sales 
said linda byus a utility analyst for duff amp phelps in chicago 
its image also is linked closely to the city which may help forge 
an amicable agreement between the two she said

still struggling to obtain financing for an 
employee buyout of ual inc union pilots of united airlines now 
are trying to beat back emerging opposition within the company 
officials of the air line pilots association sent letters over 
the weekend asking members to let the company directors know they 
support employee ownership 
the union in a letter to its members said a broad showing of 
support is needed to counteract efforts by ual chairman stephen 
wolf to undermine the buyout the union also said there has been an 
anonymously sponsored antiemployee ownership letterwriting 
campaign within the company 
ual spokeswoman sara dornaker said monday she did not know the 
origin of the letterwriting campaign but she said several 
hundred employees have written to wolf expressing concern about 
an employee buyout would burden the company with too much debt 
there is a growing concern in the industry and among employees 
about being a highly leveraged carrier in these highly uncertain 
times she said 
doug wellman vice president of the association of flight 
attendants united local said his union will join the pilots in 
urging its members to write to ual directors 
he denied the union letters have anything to do with the 
struggle to obtain financing for the buyout 
it has to do with the illconceived antibuyout 
propaganda surfacing within the company he said 
wellman said several hundred letters opposing employee ownership 
are inconsequential considering the number of company employees 
more than 71000 
it was not known whether the third union in the buyout attempt 
the machinists also would write the directors spokesmen were not 
in their offices late monday and could not be reached for comment 
by telephone 
the pilots union said in its letter that if the effort toward 
employee ownership falls through it is ready to confront senior 
management up to and including a strike 
union spokesman james hanson said the letter merely spells out 
the ultimate option and is not a strike threat 
the pilots flight attendants and machinists unions have offered 
201 a share or 438 billion for ual the parent of united 
airlines the companys directors accepted the offer but the 
employee group has had trouble coming up with the financing 
union officials said it was within days of arranging financing 
with some lenders and within hours with others when iraq 
invaded kuwait the effect on oil prices the cost of running an 
airline and the uncertainty introduced into the economy may 
continue to cause difficulty with financing the union said 
a 300ashare offer collapsed for lack of financing last 
october 
the ual board meets thursday but the union has until oct 9 to 
arrange financing the employee group failed t meet a deadline in 
august and was given a twomonth extension by the directors the 
board said then that if the financing was not in place by oct 9 
the deal would be off

automakers are showing little or no gain in 
fuel economy for the fifth straight year with 1991 model cars 
having on average as much thirst at the gas pumps as they did in 
1987 the government reported today 
the environmental protection agency released the new fuel 
economy figures as the senate considered legislation that would 
require sharp improvements in automobile fuel efficiency over the 
next decade 
according to the epas annual fuel economy statistics covering 
about 1000 cars the 1991 models both domestics and imports 
show an overall average of 281 miles per gallon slightly better 
than last year and identical to the fleet average in 1987 
while the most miserly cars such as the minicompact geo metro 
attain more than 50 mpg more than half of the cars on the list 
achieved no better than 22 mpg the increasingly popular passenger 
vans and specialty vehicles could on average do no better than the 
high teens 
the manufacturers want to sell bigger engines more muscle and 
acceleration which they call performance said joan claybrook 
president of public citizen a washingtonbased consumer 
organization and a frequent critic of the automakers 
auto industry executives have pointed to the significant 
improvements in fuel economy of cars since the 1970s when the 
fleet average was only about 14 mpg and attribute the more recent 
figures to consumer demand for larger and peppier cars 
similar views are found in automobile showrooms 
its not the industry pushing performance its the consumer 
thats been demanding it in the last few years said ray turk a 
salesman at a nissan dealership in suburban maryland 
janice walsh was one of those consumers the other day as she 
prepared to take a sporty nissan 300zx for a test spin taking 
little notice of its skimpy 18 mpg mileage rating for city driving 
i like a car thats fun she said 
down the road at another dealership retiree john webb and his 
wife said the 17 mpg city driving estimate on a mercury marquis 
didnt bother them when we travel we want a goodsized car and 
lots of trunk space said webb we really havent talked about 
mileage 
the epa noted that between the mid1970s and early 1980s 
significant gains were made in making automobiles more 
fuelefficient since 1982 however the overall fleet fuel 
economy figures have increased only slightly partly because stable 
oil prices reduced the demand for fuelefficient vehicles 
since 1987 the fleetwide averages have been virtually at a 
standstill they were 281 mpg in 1987 286 mpg in 1988 281 mpg 
in 1989 and 278 mpg in 1990 
as in previous years the 1991 figures showed a wide range of 
gas mileage from the minicompact geo metro that gets 58 mpg on the 
highway and only a few miles less in the city to the luxurious 
twoseater lamborghini diablo that gets 9 mpg on city streets 
four of the 10 best performing cars were variations of the geo 
a japanesemade minicompact that is sold through general moors 
the others were two versions of the honda civic crx two varieties 
of the suzuki swift a daihatsu charade and a dieselpowered 
volkswagen jetta all get at least 37 mpg in the city and 42 mpg on 
the highway 
at the other extreme were the lamborghini five versions of the 
rollsroyce two ferraris and two bmws none of which attained 
more than 12 mpg in city driving and generally only slightly higher 
on the highways 
even within various size categories the fuel efficiency of 
different cars varied widely as expected small economy cars 
generally showed much better fuel economy than expensive and 
performanceleaning luxury models 
the epa listed only 35 cars subject to the socalled gas 
guzzler tax which in the case of the lamborghini diablo amounts 
to 3200 but those figures can be misleading 
the guzzler tax which kicks in if a car gets less than 225 mpg 
in combined city and highway driving is based on raw test results 
while the epa figures are adjusted downward by a mathematical 
formula so the mileage figures more closely reflect actual driving 
conditions 
using the adjusted epa figures 393 of the 728 cars specialty 
vehicles and passenger vans on the list attained gas mileage of 
less than 225 mpg all but a handful of the nearly 300 trucks on 
the list also failed to meet the 225 mpg figure 
trucks passenger vans and specialty vehicles are not covered by 
the tax which is assessed only on cars based on a sliding scale 
depending on miles per gallon

a decision has yet to be made about where toyota 
motor corp will put its new us assembly plant but one executive 
favors midamerica 
bob mccurry executive vice president of toyotas us sales and 
marketing arm said monday that the company needs the capacity of 
another car plant to meet its goal of selling 15 million cars and 
trucks in the united states by the mid1990s 
about 80 percent of those vehicles or 13 million will be 
cars said spokesman john mccandless 
if that goal is met and if current sales trends continue into 
the mid1990s toyota could overtake chrysler corp as the nations 
thirdlargest automaker before that can happen toyota has to 
develop more manufacturing capacity mccurry said 
to do the volume were talking about with 50 percent of 
production in this market we need new facilities mccurry said 
toyota officials have said an announcement about the location of 
a new assembly plant should be made within two months but mccurry 
hedged monday saying only that a decision would be made soon 
a possible place is next to toyotas assembly plant now 
operating in georgetown ky there is available land on the site 
and supply lines already are in place 
toyota also has the option in 1996 to buy general motors corps 
share of the companies joint new united motor manufacturing inc 
plant near fremont calif which builds the toyota corolla and 
gms geo prizm 
when asked about the possible location of a new plant mccurry 
said im one who believes your plants should be in 
midamerica 
in 1989 toyota sold 707357 cars and chrysler sold 1077651 
cars but through the first eight months of this year chryslers 
car sales of 560057 were down 216 percent from last year while 
toyotas 602562 were up 157 percent 
toyotas sales in august set a company record partly because of 
an aggressive sales campaign and inflated the yeartodate figure 
mccurrys comments came during the introduction of a newly 
designed tercel entrylevel car he said the two and fourdoor 
models of the car which looks similar to a ford tempo is the 
lowestpriced car in america with a trunk 
the base price for the twodoor is 6488 mccurry said he 
expected the price for a typically equipped tercel with all dealer 
handling costs taxes and fees included would cost about 8400 
the car targets the hyundai excel nissan sentra and ford 
escort mccurry said he expected 1991 tercel sales to be about 
130000 cars up from about 100000 of the 1990 models

eastern airlines has asked a federal appeals 
court to overturn a florida judges decision that the company must 
give former strikers some of the jobs taken by replacement pilots 
eastern hired about 900 replacement pilots during the 1989 
strike by the air line pilots association alpa walked out with 
easterns machinists who remain on strike but ended the action 
about nine months later 
us district judge edward davis of miami where eastern is 
based ruled last month that the union is entitled to the jobs of 
trainees but eastern attorney joseph manson argued before the 11th 
us circuit court of appeals on monday that davis erred in ruling 
that replacement pilots did not have permanent employee status if 
they were in training when the alpa strike ended 
james linsey an attorney for the union said the replacement 
workers cannot be given permanent protection until they are 
transformed into fully qualified employees 
the threejudge 11th circuit panel did not indicate when it 
would rule the number of jobs at issue also must be determined by 
the court eastern puts it at about 190 while the union says its 
400

attorneys general in missouri and 
kansas on tuesday announced an antitrust settlement in principle in 
a 1 billion natural gas pricefixing case 
bob stephan of kansas and william webster of missouri said the 
settlement with amoco production co and oxy usa a subsidiary of 
occidental petroleum in tulsa would benefit natural gas consumers 
in four states who paid excessive rates from 197985 the consumers 
were from kansas western missouri southern nebraska and northern 
oklahoma 
officials said details of the settlemene three 
major dt with two of thefendants could not be released until friday the 
deadline 
for lawyers to put the deal in writing 
the attorneys general spoke at the federal courthouse in kansas 
city kan where a consolidated lawsuit had been scheduled to 
begin tuesday against the two gas producers and williams natural 
gas co 
williams has not agreed to the settlement and jury selection 
for the suit against williams was scheduled for wednesday morning 
several utility companies who distributed the gas to consumers 
were also involved as plaintiffs webster and stephan said they 
believe those utilities would sign on to the settlement 
im sure the terms will benefit the consumers for many years 
to come stephan said at the newn that gets 18 mpg in the city john 
webb and his wife looked 
over a mercury grand marquis a big car with a v8 engine and a 
cavernous trunk 
when we travel we want a good size car and lots of trunk 
space said webb a retiree who says the marquis fits the bill 
although its city mileage is a thirsty 17 mpg 
we really havent talked about mileage webb said 
the persian gulf crisis has prompted renewed efforts in congress 
to require automakers to improve fuel economy a bill before the 
senate would require fleet averages to reach 40 mpg by 2001 a 40 
percent increase from todays averages of roughly 28 mpg 
joan claybrook president of public citizen and a frequent 
critic of the auto industry accused automakers of pushing bigger 
engines more muscle and acceleration which they call performance 
instead of trying to make cars more fuel efficient 
they want to sell speed instead of fuel economy said 
clarence ditlow head of the washingtonbased center for auto 
safety the performance cars are the higher priced cars and the 
ones with more options and more profits 
but those in the auto business say theyre only giving the 
customer what he or she wants 
its not the industry pushing performance its the consumer 
thats been demanding it in the last few years argues ray turk 
the nissan salesman at herb gordon autoworld in suburban maryland 
where ms walsh was shopping 
as in previous years the 1991 models reflected a wide range of 
mileage from the minicompact geo metro that gets 58 mpg on the 
highway and only slightly less in city driving to the luxurious 
twoseater lamborghini diablo that guzzles at 9 mpg on city 
streets 
in between are about 1000 models and variations of models of 
cars trucks and vans 
the epa list includes only 35 cars subject to a gasoline 
guzzler tax that kicks in for cars getting 225 mpg or less and 
in the case of the lamborghini diablo amounts to 3200 
but those numbers may be misleading 
for tax purposes only the raw fuel economy test scores are 
used not the lower epa figures that are adjusted through a 
mathematical formula to better reflect actual driving conditions 
increasingly popular passenger vans speciality vehicles and trucks 
also are excluded 
using the adjusted epa figures more than half the cars listed 
showed a fuel economy of fewer than 225 mpg with the average 
mileage for increasingly popular passenger vans and 4wheel drive 
speciality vehicles coming in at fewer than 20 mpg 
four of the 10 cars with the best fuel economy were variations 
of the geo a japanesebuilt car sold through general motors 
the others were two variations of the honda civic two versions 
of the suzuki swift the daihatsu charade and the dieselpowered 
volkswagen jetta all with mileage estimates of between 37 mpg and 
49 mpg in the city and 43 mpg to 52 mpg on the highway 
at the other extreme were the lamborghini diablo five versions 
of the rollsroyce two bmws and a pair of ferraris none of the 10 
vehicles achieved more than 12 mpg in city driving 
according to industry figures those worst and best performers 
account for only a small fraction of the vehicles likely to be on

the us dollar ended mixed against major 
currencies in european trading today 
gold prices rose again amid anxieties over the persian gulf 
crisis increasing as much as 11 an ounce 
foreign exchange dealers said the dollar benefitted from 
technical factors linked to cross trading between the japanese yen 
and major european currencies 
they said the dollar could be helped if oil prices lose momentum 
and wall street remains relatively steady

prices on the japanese economy which depends heavily on imported 
oil was driving investors out of the yen to major european 
currencies particularly the safehaven swiss franc

the environmental benefits of atlantic 
richfield cos new premium unleaded gasoline outweigh any possible 
health risks suggested by private tests scientists said 
the tests indicate the gasoline designed to reduce pollutants 
produces a 34 percent increase in emissions of a suspected 
carcinogen 
but scientists said the fuels overall benefits to clean air and 
health are worthwhile and the increased concentrations of 
13butadiene were too small to pose a health threat 
i dont personally think the emissions are anything to worry 
about i think were buying a lot more by reducing the benzene and 
the carbon monoxide and hydrocarbons said rogene henderson an 
inhalation toxicologist at the lovelace inhalation and toxicology 
research institute 
arco unveiled its new ecpremium on sept 6 calling theffuel 
the cleanest burning gasoline available in southern california 
environmentalists became concerned about the new formula after 
obtaining previously undisclosed results of arcos testing 
compared to conventional unleaded premium arco had said the new 
fuel reduced emissions of cancercausing benzene by 36 percent 
carbon monoxide by 28 percent and smogforming hydrocarbons by 21 
percent 
but the company made no mention of the 34 percent increase in 
emissions of 13butadiene and a possible 98 percent increase in 
smogforming nitrogen oxides 
arco confirmed the butadiene results monday the los angeles 
times reported in its tuesday editions however the company said 
the 98 percent nitrogen oxide increase was based on unreliable 
data 
butadiene used in manufacturing some rubber is a toxic 
component of tailpipe emissions that is considered less threatening 
to health than benzene 
emissions of 13butadiene from ecpremium were measured at 33 
milligrams per mile compared to 25 milligrams per mile for 
conventional unleaded premium gasoline 
scientists at the lovelace institute in albuquerque nm and 
the health effects institute in cambridge mass said that even 
with a 34 percent increase the 13butadiene concentrations were 
too small to be significant 
dan townsend manager of arcos clean fuels task force said 
that despite the increase in butadiene ecpremium reduces 
pollutants overall 
while the butadiene is up all of the other toxics are down 
enough that the overall cancer risk is down by 28 percent 
townsend said

a hearing on conflictofinterest allegations 
against neil bush opened today with a judge rejecting a witness 
attempt to invoke the fifth amendment and offering to take 
testimony in private a second witness refused to talk voluntarily 
and faced a subpoena 
the federal office of thrift supervision is trying to bar the 
presidents son from the banking and savings industry the 
regulators in february accused neil bush of wrongdoing in his 
former role as a director of silverado banking savings and loan 
which failed in late 1988 at an cost to taxpayers of 1 billion he 
could be banned from the banking and savings industry 
the presidents 35yearold son a denver oil and gas developer 
was not present when the hearing began today before a nearly full 
courtroom bush who adamantly denies wrongdoing was expected to 
be the final witness of 11 scheduled to testify this week 
after the hearing was called to order today former silverado 
chairman michael wise asserted his fifth amendment right to refuse 
to answer questions on the ground that he could incriminate 
himself 
administrative law judge daniel j davidson disagreed that the 
right could be claimed at such a hearing saying i do have the 
authority to require mr wise to answer despite his claim to the 
fifth amendment 
he then adjoured the opened hearing and the participants went 
into a closed session in his chambers 
it was not immediately clear whether wise agreed to testify in 
private or continued to take the fifth wise left the closed 
hearing after about a halfhour and would not respond to reporters 
questions 
davidson had said that wises testimony in his chambers would be 
on the record and that a transcript would be made available later 
probably at the end of todays hearing 
another former silverado director scheduled to testify florian 
barth today gave a letter to ots lawyers saying he will not 
testify voluntarily davidson promptly announced he would sign a 
subpoena aimed at forcing barths testimony 
the open hearing finally got under way with former silverado 
executive vice president russell m murray he answered questions 
put by bushs attorney james nesland who attempted to show that 
murray was aware that silverado had guidelines for approving loans 
and lines of credit to board members 
the ots is seeking an order against bush banning him from the 
industry to avoid alleged conflicts of interest the president has 
said he will not interfere with the disciplinary process 
last week bush and other former silverado directors were also 
sued for 200 million by the federal deposit insurance corp the 
lawsuit alleged that gross negligence on the part of silverado 
directors contributed to the sampls collapse 
ots contends bush failed to disclose adequately to silverado his 
business relationships with kenneth m good and bill l walters 
two big borrowers from silverado who defaulted on loans totaling 
more than 130 million 
the two denver developers helped finance bushs oil and gas 
company jnb exploration at the same time bush voted on the mens 
requests from silverado for millions in loans and a line of credit 
the ots has alleged 
bush could have avoided the hearing by agreeing not to dispute 
the charges as other sampl officials have done by fighting the 
government he has taken the case out of attorneys and regulators 
offices into a rare public forum 
the swords are drawn his attorney james nesland said 
recently 
the judge has until dec 6 to recommend a ruling to ots director 
timothy ryan who has until april 8 to make a final decision on 
whether to impose the sanctions bush could appeal most likely to 
a federal appeals court in denver 
in his testimony today murray discussed a 900000 line of 
credit that bush and denver developer kenneth good obtained from 
the silverado board in 1986 for an oil and gas exploration 
partnership in argentina 
the line of credit never was tapped but the boards approval of 
the request is one of the conflictofinterest counts leveled by 
the ots against bush who voted as a board member on the 
transaction 
murray said he talked to good bush and wise about the line of 
credit and decided to submit the matter to the silverado investment 
committee and then to the silverado board because of bushs 
involvement in the deal 
i knew there were some limitations on loans to officers and 
directors murray said

multimillionaire financier sir jack lyons was 
fined 3 million pounds or 56 million tuesday for his part in 
the guinness takeover scandal but escaped a jail sentence because 
of ill health 
the judge also announced that guinness chairman ernest saunders 
sentenced to five years in the same case would not have to face a 
second trial on related charges because the prosecution had decided 
it would not be in the public interest 
at southwark crown court judge sir denis henry said lyons was 
guilty of dishonesty on a major scale and could have expected a 
threeyear prison sentence 
but after medical testimony that lyons 74 had cancer heart 
problems high blood pressure and chronic bronchitis the judge 
said he would not send lyons to jail 
lyons was ordered to pay 440000 pounds 831000 toward 
government legal costs 
lyons was convicted aug 27 on six counts of conspiracy to 
commit fraud false accounting and theft 
he and three other figures in londons city financial district 
were charged with organizing an illegal operation to boost the 
stock market price of shares in guinness during a successful 
takeover battle for distillers co a scotch whisky and gin maker 
the distillers takeover involved buying large blocks of guinness 
shares to make them more attractive than those of rival bidder 
argyll a supermarket operator 
the prosecution claimed guinness paid about 25 million pounds 
48 million at the time in unlawful indemnities against losses in 
share dealing and in fees for a successful outcome 
lyons bought guinness shares for himself and clients and was 
paid more than 3 million pounds 58 million in illegal success 
fees and indemnities he later repaid nearly 2 million pounds 
nearly 4 million of the money he received

michael milkens lawyer has asked the judge who 
will sentence him for fraud to spare the former junkbond king from 
imprisonment and let him repent by helping innercity youth court 
papers released today said 
such a sentence would constitute a most serious punishment 
but it would be purposeful punishment wrote his lead attorney 
arthur liman in a sentencing proposal to us district judge kimba 
wood 
he said milken could work under the auspices of the los angeles 
police department near the financiers home and that its chief 
daryl f gates supported the idea it would not only embody the 
concept of social restitution but would also hold him fully 
accountable and punish him for his behavior in the most appropriate 
way liman said 
the lawyer also asserted that milken 44 already has been 
punished severely by nearly four years of intense public scrutiny 
payment of a record 600 million in fines and penalties and a bleak 
future fighting civil lawsuits 
we cannot adequately describe the anguish and devastation that 
this experience has caused michael an intensely private and 
sensitive individual the memorandum said everyone who has 
come into contact with him speaks of his acute pain and 
suffering 
limans sentencing proposal portrayed milken as a brilliant 
selfless family man who spurned the life of the rich and famous 
despite amassing enormous wealth in the securities industry over 
nearly two decades 
michaels passion lies in his ideas his life has been devoted 
to seeking value for others for michael substantial 
compensation was a byproduct of his ideas the defense said 
the proposal was hundreds of pages long and was accompanied by 
lengthy appendices with statements of support from more than 240 
people ranging from close relatives and leading business figures to 
milkens family rabbi 
milkens lawyer released the sentencing proposal to wood with 
less than a week to go before she is scheduled to pronounce 
punishment for milken the most influential financier of the 1980s 
and the biggest figure to fall in the wall street securities fraud 
scandal that broke in 1986 
such sentencing proposals are usually released on the day a 
defendant is sentenced but because of the enormous interest in the 
milken case wood ordered versions released early edited to delete 
incriminating references to others the government was working to 
make its version available later 
milken former head bond trader at the once powerful drexel 
burnham lambert inc reversed longstanding claims of innocence and 
pleaded guilty to six felonies in april most of the charges were 
linked to his relationship with fallen stock speculator ivan f 
boesky 
there has been intense speculation about what sentence will be 
imposed by wood who has been swamped with letters both in support 
of leniency and heavy punishment he faces a maximum of 28 years in 
prison 
wood has given no indication what she will do but the 
government has urged her to consider a vast array of unproven 
crimes milken allegedly committed 
in its reply to the prosecutions sentencing memorandum the 
defense argued that the judge should not consider any evidence 
relating to other alleged crimes it also asked the court not to 
punish the financier for the collapse of drexel or in reaction to 
his considerable wealth 
the defense said the governments strategy of presenting 
additional allegations prior to sentencing violated milkens 
constitutional rights 
it also said that imposing a provisional sentence subject to 
possible reduction based on the value of milkens cooperation with 
the governments continuing investigation of insider trading 
would violate both his constutional rights and his earlier plea 
agreement

us trade representative carla hills who is 
complaining about european subsidies to airbus industrie finds the 
jet makers loan to northwest airlines particularly disturbing 
a spokeswoman said tuesday 
in a sept 14 letter to the european community hills said she 
wants clarification and information about the loan as soon as 
possible said spokeswoman torie clarke 
hills believes the 500 million loan was an unfair inducement to 
get northwest to buy 75 jets built by airbus a fournation 
european consortium 
the united states has threatened to go to an international 
tribunal the general agreement on tariffs and trade with 
complaints about the 13 billion in government subsidies that 
airbus receives hills believes the subsidies are unfair to 
american manufacturers 
the loan is a new element of concern and the industry is quite 
concerned clarke said 
hills has given the ec until sunday to respond satisfactorily to 
her complaint about airbus subsidies clarke said 
representatives of airbus and the ec deny the northwest loan was 
unfair 
the facts as she states in the letter cannot be 
substantiated said ella krucoff a spokeswoman for the ec 
delegation in washington 
alan boyd chairman of airbus north american division said the 
northwest loan was strictly a commercial transaction financed by 
private banks 
boyd told the saint paul minn pioneer press that the loan 
follows a precedent established in 1987 when boeing co bought 700 
million in convertible notes from allegis then the parent company 
to united airlines as part of a jet sale 
northwest based in eagan minn must repay the loan within 
seven years boyd said he said it is secured with nonairbus 
aircraft and parts and the interest rate is not below 10 percent

the senate decided against cutting off debate 
today on legislation requiring more fuelefficient cars a major 
setback for a bill automakers claim would require them to stop 
making large cars 
the senate rejected 5742 a petition asking that the measure be 
brought to a vote sixty votes were needed to cut off debate 
the bill would require cars to achieve a fleet average of 35 mpg 
by 1995 and 40 mpg by 2001 the bills sponsor sen richard bryan 
dnev said that eventually would save 28 million barrels of oil 
a day 
bryan had said he was optimistic about the legislations passage 
and argued the higher automobile fuel efficiency requirements were 
needed to curb americas thirst for foreign oil 
but opponents led by sen donald riegle dmich waged an 
intense campaign against the measure maintaining that the tougher 
fuel economy requirements would lead to the production of smaller 
cars and increased traffic deaths 
the automakers in recent week lobbied intensely against the 
legislation and auto industry unions sent thousands of telegrams to 
senators urging the legislation not be approved 
the measures chances all along appeared brightest in the 
senate 
even some supporters expressed doubt that the bill would be 
approved in the house where it is staunchly opposed by rep john 
dingell dmich chairman of the energy and commerce committee 
through which the bill normally must be channeled 
aides to president bush have said they would recommend a veto if 
the bill is approved by congress 
late monday the senate rejected 4946 an amendment by sen paul 
simon dill that would have provided special unemployment aid 
for workers who lose their jobs because automakers must shift to 
producing more fuelefficient vehicles 
sen slade gorton rwash a bill cosponsor said the simon 
amendment would doom this bill because of many senators 
opposition to a worker assistance proposal 
meanwhile an amendment was approved 5540 to include new 
incentives for automakers to produce vehicles that can run on 
alternative fuels such as methanol ethanol or compressed natural 
gas the measure would let manufacturers claim more credits against 
fuel efficiency requirements if they produce such vehicles 
the floor debate monday centered on whether the high fuel 
economy requirements would force manufacturers to dramatically 
reduce the size of their cars and doom the future of the 
sixpassenger family sedan 
it means smaller cars it means less safe cars declared 
riegle whose state is home to the major us automakers 
bryan disputed such claims arguing that higher fuel efficiency 
can be achieved without sacrificing car size he noted that auto 
executives made the same claims in the 1970s when faced with 
tougher fuel economy requirements 
that just didnt happen the sixpassenger vehicle is here 
just as it was before said bryan

from the boxing ring to the trading ring ray 
pace never has been one to back down 
but in a federal courtroom that is the venue for his latest 
confrontation pace fights the feeling that he is already whipped 
he says its not because he has no hope of winning his case but 
because the cost of his defense has nearly wiped him out 
to see that everything youve saved is gone because of this 
trial its a hard pill to swallow said pace an amateur boxer 
in the chicago area from 1976 to 1981 
pace 34 is one of 14 commodity traders from the chicago 
mercantile exchange standing trial on charges of defrauding 
customers while executing their orders in the mercs busy japanese 
yen futures pit 
he also is accused of racketeering conspiracy a charge that 
carries a maxmimum penalty of 20 years in prison and possible 
confiscation by authorities of his home and personal property 
pace is not a poor man for several years before his indictment 
in august 1989 he could gross more than 1000 in commissions on a 
good day working as a broker in the yen pit 
but neither is he one of the relatively few millionaire 
speculators personifying the popular perception of chicagos 
commodity traders as highrolling fat cats with expensive german 
cars and luxurious homes on the lake michigan shore 
in an interview in his lawyers office pace said he owns a 1988 
chevy blazer and his wife cleo a realestate broker drives a 1988 
cadillac 
he said their cars and their threebedroom home in westmont a 
middleclass suburb not far from his bluecollar hometown of 
cicero are the only assets left to seize in the event of a 
racketeering conviction 
like many of the total 47 traders and a clerk who were indicted 
last year on commodity fraud charges in chicago pace contends he 
is a little fish caught in an indiscriminate fbi net 
it could have been anybody who was down there filling orders 
at that time he said 
paces defense is that he only did what everybody else was 
doing defense attorney steven rosenberg told the us district 
court jury in an opening statement sept 13 that pace and every 
other merc trader routinely violated exchange rules he said they 
changed or invented the prices at which customer orders were 
executed to repay other traders who absorbed their trading errors 
rosenberg said such rule violations did not constitute 
racketeering fraud or losses to customers he said exchange 
officials tolerated such activities although they deny it 
the son of a factory worker pace entered the risky world of 
commodities trading after a dissatisfying stint as a high school 
football and baseball coach during part of that time he was in 
the boxing ring 
i enjoyed it a lot but i just didnt see it financially 
said the ruggedly handsome pace who remains physically fit i 
was making 13000 or 14000 my first year i didnt know if i 
wanted to stay in coaching for 25 years to start making some decent 
money 
his wife was employed at that time by a commodities trading 
firm another trading company offered pace a job and he took it 
he began in 1982 as a runner carrying papers between the 
trading pits and his companys desk on the merc floor for 150 a 
week 
late in 1984 pace passed a series of exams and received his 
broker credentials he took ajob as an assistant to a more 
experienced broker who belonged to a broker association 
broker associations are groups of independent traders who fill 
customer orders for the major brokerage houses they pool a portion 
of their commissions to pay their shared expenses 
paces job was to stand next to his employer in the mercs swiss 
franc futures pit one of the pits that was later infiltrated by 
fbi agents and deal him the customer orders 
paces salary rose to 200 then 300 a week most of it went 
toward the exchange membership or seat that he leased through the 
broker association for about 800 a month the seat allowed him to 
trade in the pit 
i went through five to 10 grand of my own money to stay in 
business at that time because i wasnt making enough to pay the 
bills he recalled 
by 1988 pace said he was making enough money from commissions 
and personal trades to give up his salary he leased a more 
prestigious exchange seat for 3500 a month and moved from the 
swiss franc pit to the more active japanese yen pit 
fbi agent dietrich volk also was in the yen pit in 1988 posing 
as corrupt trader peter vogel while he secretly recorded 
conversations among traders inside and outside the pit 
pace was indicted in august 1989 along with 20 other traders 
from the yen pit representing about onefifth of the pits normal 
trader population seven of them have pleaded guilty to reduced 
charges 
pace said his income has fallen dramatically since his 
indictment while legal fees have consumed his life savings he has 
dropped back to the less expensive exchange membership and said his 
wife is seeking work with a steadier income than real estate sales 
pace said he and several other indicted yen traders have 
continued to fill customer orders despite the exchanges request 
that they refrain from doing so but his tradingthree new names were proposed 
tuesday for the 
union of soviet socialist republics including two that do away 
with the word soviet 
in a parliamentary debate on the union treaty that is being 
drawn up between the kremlin and the 15 soviet republics these 
names were proposed the union of sovereign socialist states the 
union of soviet sovereign republics and the union of euroasian 
republics 
rafik nishanov chairman of one of the supreme soviets two 
chambers and an ethnic uzbek revealed the names he said the 
proposed name change to the union of sovereign socialist states 
first reported sept 8 came from president mikhail s gorbachev 
the union of soviet sovereign republics came from a group of 
legislators from kazakhstan 
the union of euroasian republics was one entry in a contest 
organized by radical members of the parliament 
the word soviet is disliked by nationalist movements in some 
republics because they consider the soviets to be invaders who 
forced them to accept communist and russian domination 
nishanov has said a name change may be approved as part of the 
new union treaty which is expected to redefine the country as 
somewhere between a federation and an economic alliance action on 
the treaty is expected before the end of the year

obvious threat to world peace conable said 
in his remarks bush said iraqs invasion of kuwait has had 
devastating reprecussions with serious disruptions in trade and 
the flow of oil as well as major problems with refugees and 
displaced workers 
this staggering burden which is pressing upon these most 
seriously affected countries calls for a generous response from 
the world community bush said 
he said the united states already has begun to mobilize 
financial help for frontline states such as egypt jordan and 
turkey suffering as a result of a loss of trade with iraq because 
of sanctions against baghdad 
on a recent trip secretary of state james a baker iii secured 
promises of 20 billion in military and financial aid 
bush said that to transform commitments into concrete 
contributions he was establishing a gulf crisis financial 
coordination group with the aim of achieving effective timely 
and sustained financial support to these most seriously affected 
countries 
the group will be under the chairmanship of treasury secretary 
nicholas brady its members also will include saudi arabia kuwait 
united arab emirates qatar germany britain italy france 
japan canada south korea the european community and possibly 
others 
the imf and world bank will provide technical advice and 
support 
the political leadership of the un must be matched by the 
economic leadership of the imf and the world bank bush said 
top finance officials from 152 member nations and for the first 
time an invited delegation from the soviet union are attending 
the meetings soviet representatives were not in earlier 
closeddoor policymaking sessions but sat toward the back of the 
hall in the plenary session today 
soviet officials have said informally they want to join all 
major international lending institutions but the united states has 
always opposed soviet membership in the world bank or the imf 
the bank is not a relief agency conable said in announcing 
an emergency assistance program but it can help by financing 
expenditures for rehabilitation and other services which generate 
immediate employment and income while building productive 
assets 
the world bank is already taking action he said we have 
the flexibility to respond quickly in such crises 
conable said the bank also is taking other steps these include 
speeding up existing loan programs for countries affected by rising 
oil prices and other results of iraqs takeover of kuwait 
president bush was to address the finance officials this 
afternoon the president planned to call on the imf to show 
economic leadership in the gulf crisis to match the political 
leadership already taken by the united nations presidential 
spokesman marlin fitzwater said 
michel camdessus imf managing director told the delegates they 
had to face critical questions in dealing with the gulf crisis 
they include what policies to adopt to ward off a global recession 
and how to improve global trade and the international monetary 
system 
the crisis in the middle east has reminded us all that peace 
is fragile and that economies are always vulnerable camdessus 
said 
in closeddoor sessions of world finance ministers who oversee 
the institutions both the bank and the imf put together plans for 
helping nations affected by iraqs takeover of kuwait and the 
subsequent rise in oil prices 
details were being worked out but the two institutions were 
expected to supply billions of additional dollars to poor countries 
hurt by the crisis 
at a news conference monday night conable declined to say how 
much assistance the bank or the fund would provide in response to 
the gulf crisis 
you tell us how long the crisis is going to last and maybe we 
can help you on that he said in response to a reporters 
question 
in the case of refugees he said it is difficult to predict how 
many there might be with 1 million or more still in iraq and 
kuwait 
the refugee workers had traveled to iraq and kuwait from 
surrounding countries and from as far away as korea and the 
philippines salaries sent to families at home are a significant 
source of hard cash for the countries to buy goods abroad 
in some countries the workers will be returning to areas where 
jobs and housing are scarce 
earlier monday the imfs policymaking interim committee 
promised in a communique that it would respond on an expedited 
basis to the mideast crisis 
among imf programs that could be tapped for money is a 
compensatory fund used in the past to aid nations hit by 
earthquakes and hurricanes

boise cascade corp said tuesday it has 
tightened its procedures to head off unsolicited takeover bids 
the boisebased wood products company announced it has reduced 
the amount of stock a single person or group can obtain before 
triggering the compays shareholder rights plan 
under the revisions the plan will be triggered if a person or 
group obtains 15 percent of the companys voting securities down 
from 20 percent 
the revised plan encourages a potential acquirer to negotiate 
with the board of directors earlier than was likely under the 
previous plan the company said in a statement 
the new plan also lowers from 25 percent to 15 percent the 
amount of stock ownership that will trigger a process under which 
stockholders can exercise their right to acquire additional shares 
of stock at a market value equal to twice the exercise price of the 
right 
company officials said they adopted the revisions so they could 
better represent stockholder interests in the face of a takeover 
bid

the stock market rallied today as investors 
focused on blue chip issues at the expense of the broader market 
analysts said the market was ripe for an advance after the dow 
jones average of 30 industrials fell to a 14month low in the 
previous session but todays gains were spotty and market 
watchers doubted the advance would be sustained 
investors prefered blue chip issues because of their high 
visibility of earnings and growth said charles jensen chief 
technical analyst at mki securities corp but the broader market 
languished 
while investors went bargain hunting the market drew support 
from a number of factors including the possibility that there will 
be a resolution this week on the budget deficit a firming bond 
market the fact that stock prices remained buoyant despite soviet 
foreign minister eduard shevardnadzes assessment that war could 
break out at any moment in the middle east 
separately enthusiasm for potential takeover targets was 
rekindled by hectic trading in mca whose stock skyrocketed after 
it was disclosed the company is discussing a possible buyout with 
japans matsushita electric industrial co at a price reported to 
be between 80 and 90 a share or as high as 75 billion

with oil approaching 40 a barrel a group of 
energy visionaries said tuesday that a study finds america windy 
enough to provide all the energy the country needs if only it 
would harness the breezes 
the american wind energy association met in convention to 
promote wind power already providing onetenth of 1 percent of 
the nations electricity as one answer to energy crises like 
those generated by the upheaval in the persian gulf 
dale osborn president of us windpower inc said wind is not 
only plentiful but also environmentally benign abundant 
clean nonpolluting and domestic his california company that has 
sold 2 billion kilowatt hours of windgenerated electricity since 
1982 
the turbines wind turns emit no carbon dioxide the villain in 
acid rain and dont contribute to the greenhouse effect the 
warming of the atmosphere 
at a news conference osborn presidentelect of the 
association called wind power a proven functioning and 
everincreasing economic success 
the study conducted for the energy department by pacific 
northwest laboratories a unit of battelle memorial institute 
establishes the immense potential of wind energy to meet 
americas energy needs said randall swisher the organizations 
executive director 
the study said 15 percent of the area of the 48 contiguous 
states has usable winds averaging 16 mph or more at 50 meters above 
the ground the wind speed generally needed to produce electricity 
competitively 
thats the average speed of the winds that turn the 15000 
turbines already in commercial use in california the worlds wind 
energy pioneer 
swisher said north dakota and texas together offer enough wind 
to replace the energy produced by two billion barrels of oil 
making each of those states a virtual saudi arabia of wind 
if both were fully utilized they would provide 80 percent of 
the nations electricity he said 
the report said california has developed only onefifth of its 
areas with 16 mph winds they produce 22 billion kilowatts a year 
the equivalent of 35 million barrels of oil somewhat less than 
half of one days imports 
but californias wind potential is exceeded in 13 other states 
north dakota texas kansas montana south dakota nebraska 
wyoming oklahoma minnesota iowa colorado new mexico and idaho 
and equalled in three others new york illinois and michigan 
the study said 
only four states alabama mississippi florida and louisiana 
were found to lack commercial wind potential swisher said 
new technology soon will make it possible for winds that blow at 
an average of only 14 mph winds to produce commercial electricity 
swisher said 
he said the report established that theoretically at least 
the united states has enough harnessable wind to produce 100 
billion quadrillion btus of energy a year the country consumes 82 
billion quadrillion btus 
but investment costs and storage and transmission problems are 
barriers and esthetic concerns rule out some windy landscapes as 
the sites of wind turbines swisher said 
so a realistic goal is for wind to provide 10 to 20 percent of 
the nations electricity over the next 20 to 30 years he said 
the downside is that wind is intermittent it blows on and 
off so wind power needs to be integrated with other 
technologies to make sure electricity is on hand when it is 
wanted he added 
but developments in storing electric power are coming along fast 
enough he said to render the problem of intermittence 
irrelevant 
whats more said carl weinberg research manager for pacific 
gas and electric we have learned that utilities can manage 
energy sources turned off by nature just as well as we manage 
energy sources turned off by man 
osborn said that potentially at least wind power could provide 
all the nations energy but he shies from making that claim he 
said because our credibility will be challenged people would 
say there go those wildeyed californians again

marriott corp announced tuesday it will 
delay construction starts on most of its new projects including 
hotels and senior citizens housing units following a review of its

center stage on world foreign exchange markets 
gold prices pulled back slightly in domestic dealing but moved

cross trading between the yen and the german mark 
comments by an unidentified west german finance ministry 
official carried on news services also sparked yen purchases 
concern about the consequences that rising oil prices could have 
on the japanese economy which depends heavily on imported oil

currencies 
in an interview with a small group of reporters the german 
government official said the yen could appreciate further against 
the mark he also said that he did not foresee a freefall in 
the dollar a statement that tended to boost demand for dollars

federal workers who usually disregard the 
political rhetoric of the annual budget brouhaha fear the threat of 
mass furloughs and pay cuts may be real this year 
people are literally losing sleep over this said tom 
doherty an occupational safety and health administration inspector 
from allentown pa 
they have kids to feed and house payments to make and now 
theyre having the rug swept out from under them by the system they 
work for doherty said 
the cuts should they occur would mark the first 
governmentwide furloughs since 1986 
most of the nations 22 million federal employees already have 
been warned they may be furloughed 22 days or more in fiscal 1991 
if congress and the white house fail to agree on a deficit 
reduction plan before the oct 1 deadline 
the forced unpaid days off would be part of 85 billion in cuts 
to be triggered monday by the grammrudman deficit reduction law 
additional cuts would follow 
the office of management and budget has said the cuts would mean 
a 324 percent spending reduction in nondefense areas among those 
exempt from the cuts would be all presidential appointees active 
military personnel and some medical personnel at va hospitals 
at first everybody was like oh boy here we go again but 
when you hear president bush talking about tightening your belt and 
pitching in it seems a lot more serious doherty said 
on tuesday the house appropriations committee ignored president 
bushs veto threat voted to delay for 20 days deep spending cuts 
including those that could bring the mass furloughs that will be 
triggered unless congress and the white house agree on a 
deficitreduction plan 
the house is expected to consider the bill later this week 
at the white house an angry bush told reporters if there is 
no budget agreement with real spending reductions and real process 
reform by the end of the week i will have to veto it 
agencies have come up with different layoff plans 
some osha offices for example would have workers take two days 
off each week for 11 weeks to get the cuts over with as quickly as 
possible doherty said that would cost him about 568 every pay 
period through december 
government services in turn would be trimmed dramatically 
a cutback in air traffic controllers would will mean canceled 
flights and lengthy airport delays fewer guards would man the 
nations prisons meat and poultry inspectors would miss shifts 
medicare and social security checks could be delayed 
right now a large percentage of federal employees dont 
believe that its really going to happen or that it would only 
last a day or so if it did because congress will pass a resolution 
or something to take care of it said dwight bowman a 
smithsonian photographer active in the american federation of 
government employees 
but bowman said this years cuts appear more likely in light of 
the overall state of the nations economy the savings and loan 
crisis and the american military buildup in the middle east caused 
by iraqs invasion of kuwait 
theres just a lot of reasons to think that this is serious 
bowman said 
workers many of whom already feel underpaid and unappreciated 
say the possibility of cuts have hurt morale 
were responsible for the safety and health of workers in four 
counties doherty said its notsomething you do for just a 
paycheck but also because you believe in it 
when your employer kicks you in the teeth like this it makes 
you kind of lose that enthusiasm for what youre doing doherty 
said 
rose seaman who processes social security claims in akron 
ohio said budget negotiators dont realize how damaging the cuts 
will be especially for couples who both work for the government 
her husband is a federal meat inspector 
the pay will stop but rents the same child cares the same 
gas for your car is the same or going up she said this is not 
a poor rose and george thing were just working people out 
here in the heartland trying to do a job and get paid for it 
mike grotefend a union leader for federal prison workers based 
at the 800inmate facility in oxford wis said morale there is at 
an alltime low and that employees feel like pawns 
most prison guards make between 22000 and 24000 a year 
these people have car payments and house payments the horror 
stories are already starting to get around he said 
were trying to look at providing some relief within the 
union but how do you administer something on such a grand scale 
when you have so little for so many

cracks inside the shafts of 12 pratt amp 
whitney pw4000 jet engines have prompted a federal investigation 
into why the problems occurred and why the flaws were not detected 
immediately during inspections 
pratt the jetengine division of hartfords united technologies 
corp publicly acknowledged the potentially disastrous problem 
monday after several industry sources alerted the hartford courant 
about the cracks the newspaper reported tuesday in a copyright 
article 
the federal aviation administration is expected to release 
within the next week the findings of its investigation launched 
earlier this month after pratt alerted the agency that cracks had 
been found 
one of the engines had been in service before it was grounded 
pratt spokesman mark sullivan would not identify the airline that 
had used the defective engine 
we expect to present a solution to the industry in the next 
four to five days said michael ciccarelli spokesman for the 
faas regional office in burlington mass 
the defective shafts had cleared inspections at pratt and at 
lefiell manufacturing co the california subcontractor that forged 
the engine shafts for pratt the newspaper said 
in addition to the engine that had entered service two with 
cracked shafts were shipped to boeing co in seattle and one to 
airbus industrie in toulouse france for installation on their 
jumbo passenger jets 
the other eight were in various stages of assembly at pratts 
plants in connecticut most of the cracks were big enough to have 
been seen with the naked eye 
sullivan said his company sent a letter to all its customers 
advising them of the cracks 
he said pratt is completing emergency inspections on 174 engines 
delivered to aircraft builders and air carriers around the world 
most have been inspected with only the 12 found defective 
were confident that we reacted very quickly sullivan said 
and we see no problems to our airline customers or their 
passengers

the stock market rallied tuesday as 
institutional investors snapped up bluechip issues but analysts 
dismissed the advance as insignificant 
the dow jones average of 30 industrials rose 3267 to close at 
248564 the move erased roughly half the loss the key barometer 
registered in the previous session when it settled at a 14month 
low 
advancing issues only slightly outpaced decliners in nationwide 
trading of new york stock exchangelisted stocks with 770 up 745 
down and 471 unchanged 
volume on the floor of the big board came to 15594 million 
shares down from 16221 million in the previous session 
its not the kind of volume that suggests theres a stampede 
into stocks said hugh johnson senior vice president at first 
albany corp 
analysts said the market was poised for a rebound given the 
sharp selloff in the previous session but johnson joined a number 
of other market watchers in characterizing the days advance as 
puny and unsustainable 
as investors focused on bluechip issues the broader market 
languished given the tentative nature of the rally a lot more 
needs to happen before you can say things have turned around 
johnson said 
a number of factors worked to support quality stocks namely 
moderately higher prices in the bond market where a downward 
revision in the secondquarter gross national product supported the 
notion that the federal reserve would be encouraged to lower 
interest rates in addition lower oil prices also took some 
pressure off both the stock and bond markets 
separately enthusiasm for potential takeover targets was 
rekindled by heavy trading in mca whose stock skyrocketed after it 
was disclosed the company is discussing a possible buyout with 
japans matsushita electric industrial co at a price reported to 
be between 80 and 90 a share or as high as 75 billion 
mca led the big boards mostactive list skyrocketing 19 to 
54 the activity in mca which had been up as much as 25 spilled 
over to other entertainment issues paramount communications the 
third mostactive issue jumped 3 to 34 
michael metz a vice president at oppenheimer amp co said mcas 
news served as a tonic to speculators who had nothing to feed 
upon for a while

reebok international ltd forecast 
tuesday a third quarter drop in profits due to declining us 
footware sales and higher advertising costs 
the sneaker manufacturer said it expects thirdquarter earnings 
to be 33 to 35 cents per share about 25 percent lower than the 44 
cents per share earned the comparable period last year

to pump air into the shoe

to diverters buyers who send reebok shoes to discount outlets 
will cost the company about 20 million in the third quarter

in sales he said 
the company said it expects sales to rebound in the next 
quarter the backlog of orders is up 15 percent over the past five 
months compared to the same period in 1989 officials said

seasonally adjusted annual rate of 340 million units compared to 
julys revised 333 million rate sales rose 09 percent in june 
from the 1990 low of 330 million units in may 
but mortgage rates jumped back into double digits in august 
realtors chief economist john a tuccillo predicted rates would 
continue to rise during most of the fourth quarter having a 
negative impact on sales

recreational areas

1024 percent in august they averaged 1016 percent at the end of 
last week

was 97000 in august down 13 percent from july but up 13 
percent from a year earlier the median means half of the homes 
cost more half less

the persian gulf crisis put a further damper on 
the already depressed market for new issues of corporate securities 
in the third quarter a business research firm said tuesday 
initial public offerings of common stock fell to 15 billion 
from june through september their lowest level in five years 
according to securities data corp that brought the ninemonth 
tally of ipos to 84 billion down 13 percent from 1989s slow 
pace 
the volume of all common stock issues for the first three 
quarters totaled 16 billion only 1 billion ahead of the slack 
volume of a year earlier securities data did not provide figures 
for the third quarter alone 
the new jerseybased company attributed the slump to middle east 
tensions that caused oil prices to soar and stock and bond prices 
to plunge and made investors wary of the financial markets 
the volume of new issues of corporate debt excluding mortgage 
and assetbacked securities also fell securities data said 
attributing the slide not only to the persian gulf conflict but 
also to the growing federal deficit increased levels of defaults 
on loans and higher interest rates 
for the first nine months of the year 721 million in debt was 
issued down 28 percent from a year earlier securities data did 
not provide figures for the third quarter alone 
the analysis also ranked underwriters of corporate securities by 
volume merrill lynch amp co led all other investment firms during 
the first nine months underwriting nearly 353 million in us 
securities 
goldman sachs amp co with nearly 296 million in underwritten 
securities was ranked second with first boston corp third with

commonwellth edison co agreed tuesday to a 
oneyear extension of its franchise to provide electricity to 
chicago customers company officials said 
edisons old contract expires dec 31 but a string of power 
failures have raised questions about the utilitys reliability as 
it has been trying to negotiate its first new franchise with 
chicago in 42 years 
while we had hoped to reach agreement on a new franchise 
before dec 31 an extension will preserve what we believe is 
already the best set of benefits held by any major city in the 
country edison chairman james j oconnor said in a prepared 
statement 
the extension will ensure edisons continued payment of its 
municipal franchise fee of 4 percent of the companys gross 
revenues the 1990 payment is estimated at 66 million oconnor 
said 
chicago mayor richard daley expected the move and was pleased 
that the utility agreed to continue dialogue while the illinois 
commerce commission and the city investigate recent power failures

gold futures prices held nearly steady tuesday despite a drop in 
energy prices and similar reversals in other markets that usually 
are regarded as signposts for the precious metals 
silver and platinum futures fell sharply though lending 
support to the growing perception that gold is losing its 
traditional appeal as a store of value during times of rising 
consumer prices and international political turmoil 
on other commodity markets livestock and meat futures were 
mostly lower and grains and soybeans were mixed 
gold futures settled 50 cents to 70 cents lower on new yorks 
commodity exchange with the contract for delivery in september at 
40240 a troy ounce silver futures ended 8 cents to 88 cents 
lower with september at 4834 a troy ounce 
platinum futures fell 770 to 890 on the new york mercantile 
exchange where the contract for september delivery finished at 
451 a troy ounce 
analysts had no problem explaining the declines in silver and 
platinum as reactions to the governments report that the economy 
grew at a barely perceptible 04 percent annual rate in the second 
quarter 
the white metals are used in a variety of manufactured products 
so the report of unexpectedly slow growth led to expectations for 
reduced silver and platinum consumption said bette raptopoulos 
metals analyst with prudentialbache securities inc 
harder to assess was golds relatively strong performance in 
light of sharply lower oil prices sharply higher stock prices and 
a stronger dollar vs european currencies all reversals of the 
factors that were viewed as contributing to golds strong advance 
monday 
john jonat a precious metal trader with the new yorkbased 
metal and currency dealer deak international inc said golds 
stubbornness was further evidence of a change in investor attitudes 
toward the metal 
but he and others were at a loss to define what jonat called a 
new school of thought about gold some believe investors are 
turning to other markets as safe havens against inflation some 
concede they just dont know 
its a real confusing market to call jonat said 
somethings changing here its not the same old rules 
prices for nearterm deliveries of crude oil and petroleum 
products fell on the new york mercantile exchange as the likelihood 
of war in the middle east seemed to fade 
after the close the american petroleum institute released a 
weekly report that confirmed perceptions of a decline last week in 
us supplies of crude oil and an increase in heating oil stocks 
gasoline stock rose by more than 5 mllion barrels which 
exceeded expectations 
light sweet crude oil settled 72 cents lower to 125 cents 
higher with the november contract down 72 cents at 3753 a barrel 
heating oil was 272 cents lower to 311 cents higher with october 
down 272 cents at 1012 a gallon unleaded gasoline was 218 
cents lower to 76 cent higher with october down 218 cents at 
10205 a gallon 
cattle futures extended mondays losses on the chicago 
mercantile exchange amid ideas that demand for beef will slow if 
the economy weakens further 
hog futures also fell largely reflecting profittaking after 
last weeks strong gains 
live cattle were 02 cent to 70 cent lower with october at 
7855 cents a pound feeder cattle were 23 cent to 55 cent lower 
with september at 8902 cents a pound live hogs were unchanged to 
45 cent lower with october at 5480 cents a pound frozen pork 
bellies were 15 cent lower to 20 cent higher with february at 
5652 cents a pound 
soybean futures rose but most corn and wheat futures fell in a 
lackluster session on the chicago board of trade 
wheat settled 1 cents lower to cent higher with december at 
274 a bushel corn was 1 cent lower to 2 cents higher with 
december at 227 a bushel oats were 2 cents to 2 cents higher 
with december at 114 a bushel soybeans were 3 cents to 6 cents 
higher with november at 617 a bushel

janice walsh was eager to take the nissan 
300zx for a test drive like many potential buyers she wants a 
car thats fun regardless of its gas mileage automakers are 
giving her what she wants 
mileage statistics for 1991 model cars released tuesday by the 
environmental protection agency show virtually no gains in average 
fuel efficiency since 1987 with more than half the cars getting 
fewer than 23 miles per gallon 
while midsize and many of the performance cars such as the 
nissan 300zx are getting much better mileage today than a decade 
ago the epa said overall fleet fuel economy figures have 
increased only slightly since 1982 
over the last five model years the average fleet figures have 
been stuck at about 28 mpg the epa said the 1991 models about to 
be introduced average 281 mpg a shade higher than last year but 
no better than figures for 1987 
down the road from where ms walsh and her young son eyed the 
nissan that gets 18 mpg in the city john webb and his wife looked 
over a mercury grand marquis a big car with a v8 engine and a 
cavernous trunk 
when we travel we want a good size car and lots of trunk 
space said webb a retiree who says the marquis fits the bill 
although its city mileage is a thirsty 17 mpg 
we really havent talked about mileage webb said 
the persian gulf crisis has prompted renewed efforts in congress 
to require automakers to improve fuel economy 
but tuesday the senate voted 5742 to block legislation that 
would require automakers to dramatically increase the average 
mileage of their fleets to 40 mpg by 2001 a 40 percent increase 
from todays average of about 28 mpg the vote ended any chance the 
bill will pass this year 
president bush had threatened to veto the bill if it had cleared 
congress and there was formidable opposition in the house as well 
joan claybrook president of public citizen and a frequent 
critic of the auto industry accused automakers of pushing bigger 
engines more muscle and acceleration which they call performance 
instead of trying to make cars more fuel efficient 
they want to sell speed instead of fuel economy said 
clarence ditlow head of the washingtonbased center for auto 
safety the performance cars are the higher priced cars and the 
ones with more options and more profits 
but those in the auto business say theyre only giving the 
customer what he or she wants 
its not the industry pushing performance its the consumer 
thats been demanding it in the last few years argues ray turk 
the nissan salesman at herb gordon autoworld in suburban maryland 
where ms walsh was shopping 
as in previous years the 1991 models reflected a wide range of 
mileage from the minicompact geo metro that gets 58 mpg on the 
highway and only slightly less in city driving to the luxurious 
twoseater lamborghini diablo that guzzles at 9 mpg on city 
streets 
in between are about 1000 models and variations of models of 
cars trucks and vans 
the epa list includes only 35 cars subject to a gasoline 
guzzler tax that kicks in for cars getting 225 mpg or less and 
in the case of the lamborghini diablo amounts to 3200 
but those numbers may be misleading 
for tax purposes only the raw fuel economy test scores are 
used not the lower epa figures that are adjusted through a 
mathematical formula to better reflect actual driving conditions 
increasingly popular passenger vans speciality vehicles and trucks 
also are excluded 
using the adjusted epa figures more than half the cars listed 
showed a fuel economy of fewer than 225 mpg with the average 
mileage for increasingly popular passenger vans and 4wheel drive 
speciality vehicles coming in at fewer than 20 mpg 
four of the 10 cars with the best fuel economy were variations 
of the geo a japanesebuilt car sold through general motors 
the others were two variations of the honda civic two versions 
of the suzuki swift the daihatsu charade and the dieselpowered 
volkswagen jetta all with mileage estimates of between 37 mpg and 
49 mpg in the city and 43 mpg to 52 mpg on the highway 
at the other extreme were the lamborghini diablo five versions 
of the rollsroyce two bmws and a pair of ferraris none of the 10 
vehicles achieved more than 12 mpg in city driving 
according to industry figures those worst and best performers 
account for only a small fraction of the vehicles likely to be on 
the nations highways the industry estimates cars that get better 
than 40 mpg account for less than 3 percent of sales while the 
luxury cars that make up the worst mileage performers are far fewer 
in number 
energy conservation advocates and environmentalists said the 
latest figures demonstrate the failure of the auto industry to push 
fuel economy in marketing and research

a huge japanese electronics 
concern said tuesday it is negotiating to buy entertainment giant 
mca inc in a deal valued at 7 billion the latest move in 
hollywood globalization 
the proposal by matsushita electric industrial co also 
demonstrates anew the foreign craving for american trophy holdings 
the merger if completed would mirror the 1989 acquisition of 
columbia pictures entertainment by japans sony corp for 5 
billion which includes the assumption of debt 
one of the worlds largest electronics manufacturers matsushita 
makes video equipment and audio and visual components under the 
brand names panasonic technics and quasar 
mca owns universal pictures et the extraterrestrial a 
record and book publishing division guns n roses clear and 
present danger theme parks real estate and a robust television 
division quantum leap major dad 
in japan a matsushita official who spoke on condition of 
anonymity said mca was one of the companies with which matsushita 
is involved in talks but said nothing had been decided he said he 
could not comment further 
later mca issued a statement in which it confirmed it is in 
discussions with a major international company regarding a possible 
negotiated acquisition of mca 
the discussions are continuing on a friendly basis no 
agreement has been reached there is no assurance that an agreement 
will be reached the statement said 
two mca board members said in interviews that they could neither 
confirm nor deny that a deal with matsushita was being discussed 
mca president sidney sheinberg did not return telephone messages 
in tuesdays edition the wall street journal said matsushita 
was offering between 70 and 80 a share for mca stock or a range 
of about 67 billion to 75 billion for the conglomerate 
stock in mca inc which struck a 52week low of 3412 in 
trading monday surged 1925 tuesday or more than 57 percent to 
5375 other entertainment stocks also advanced in trading with 
paramount communications up 312 to 3475 a share 
the new enterprise would merge matsushitas prominent 
entertainment hardware division with mcas profitable movie and 
television divisions 
the longterm advantages are that when you make hardware you 
can benefit from the software producers success said jeffrey 
logsdon an entertainment analyst at seidler amdec securities 
theres an insatiable consumer demand for entertainment 
software 
logsdon speculated that other suitors might follow matsushitas 
bid 
us entertainment companies offer wise investments for all 
purchasers especially foreign investors with surplus cash 
entertainment is the united states second leading export behind 
aerospace accounting for a net positive trade balance of more than 
5 billion a year 
more than a quarter of matsushitas revenues are generated by 
sales of video equipment audio and electronic components combine 
for another 22 percent of revenues the company had revenues of 
about 444 billion in the year ended march 31 
if completed the mca buyout would surely renew criticism of 
japanese control of american assets that surfaced last year in the 
deals for new yorks rockefeller center and columbia pictures 
entertainment 
the japanese had been keeping a low profile in such transactions 
until a tokyo golf tycoon purchased the pebble beach golf resorts 
in california for about 950 million 
the merger also might face regulatory barriers mca owns 
independent television station wwor in secaucus nj which a 
foreign company would be prevented from owning 
michael ovitz the head of the talent agency creative artists 
agency inc has represented matsushita in its attempts to find a 
software counterpart a caa spokesman said tuesday it was premature 
to speculate if ovitz would have any role in the new enterprise 
ovitz served as an adviser to sony in its purchase of columbia 
and columbia discussed with him the possibility of running the 
studio 
since its purchase columbia has floundered and has yet to 
release any boxoffice blockbusters the new studio managers jon 
peters and peter guber inherited a production wing with few 
projects in the works 
the two immediate beneficiaries of the sale would be mca 
chairman lew wasserman who owns about 7 percent of mcas shares 
and with other officers has control of about 116 percent of its 
stock and record producer david geffen who sold his record label 
to mca in may for 550 million geffen collected 1 million shares 
of preferred stock convertible to 10 million shares of mca common 
stock or 12 percent of the company in the transaction 
the journal said matsushita wants to keep mca management in 
place 
mca earned 19177 million on revenue of 338 billion last 
year a 16 percent increase over earnings of 16491 million and 
29 billion in revenue during 1988 in its most recent quarterly 
earnings the entertainment giant earned 448 million up 7 
percent from 419 million during the same period in 1989 
at the end of last year mca had approximately 17000 employees 
universal pictures the companys motion picture subsidiary is 
known as one of hollywoods more daring studios its films include 
the xrated henry and june spike lees films the boycotted 
last temptation of christ and a variety of stylish horror 
titles 
while the studio has not produced and released many recent 
blockbusters its film library is loaded 
the titles include et the extraterrestrial the alltime 
box office champ with a domestic gate of 400 million and the 
bestselling video ever with more than 15 million cassettes sold 
other hits in the mca vault include jaws back to the 
future and its two sequels the sting twins national 
lampoons animal house and american graffiti 
these films continue to generate revenues in ancillary markets 
such as television and home video mcauniversal home video has 500 
titles in its library including some pre1948 paramount titles 
universal television produces the shows murder she wrote 
quantum leap several columbo movies the comedies 
coach major dad and uncle buck and the dramas over 
my dead body and law amp order 
universal studios hollywood was the nations third most popular 
theme park in 1989 drawing 51 million visitors 
the companys theme parks have received some bad publicity 
recently mcas 650 million 3monthold amusement park in 
orlando fla has been bothered by an array of mechanical problems 
with some of its rides and the company has sued the designer of 
the parks jaws and earthquake attractions

moodys one of the two major credit rating agencies said 
chases announcement friday that it would halve its dividend this 
quarter and boost its badloan reserves were positive steps for the 
nations secondlargest bank 
however moodys said it was concerned by the continuing 
growth in chases nonperforming real estate assets moodys also 
said it was troubled by the deteriorating northeast economy and the 
banks exposure to commercial real estate loans third world debt 
and loans that went to highdebt corporate buyouts 
moodys added that the banks basic financial structure remained 
sound 
we are disappointed in the downgrade said chase spokesman 
fraser seitel we dont think its justified 
the actions we took on friday were designed to strengthen the 
institution and even after those actions our capital today exceeds 
11 billion and our capital ratios exceed the federal guidelines 
that take effect in 1992 he said 
moodys downgraded by one notch the longterm debt rating and 
commercial paper rating of chase and several of its subsidiaries 
about 84 billion in longterm debt was affected moodys said

wall street giant shearson lehman brothers 
inc settled administrative charges with federal futures regulators 
tuesday and agreed to pay 220000 in fines for allegedly letting a 
customer break the rules 
without admitting or denying wrongdoing shearson and two 
employees agreed to settle an administrative action by the 
commodity futures trading commission charging numerous alleged 
rules violations 
in another cftc administrative action three floor brokers at 
the commodity exchange in new york were accused of defrauding 
customers in silver futures trading 
the defendants have not settled in that case 
in the shearson case the cftc accused the securities firm 
which is also a registered futures commission firm of aiding or 
allowing a customer to violate exchange limits on how many open 
contracts in orange juice futures could be traded by one person who 
is speculating rather than hedging 
a speculator trades commodity futures to profit from 
anticipating price movements while a hedger tries to minimize risk 
by taking offsetting positions in both the cash and futures 
markets 
the cftc charged that shearson and charles m barley an account 
executive at shearsons winter park fla office allowed or 
assisted a brazilian trader violate speculative position limits for 
frozen concentrated orange juice futures on the orange juice 
section of the new york cotton exchange 
the trader horst j happel of sao paulo general manager of 
citrosuco paulista sa a brazilian frozen orange juice processor 
also was charged in the cftc administrative action he has not 
settled with the agency 
shearson and the manager of the winter park office gerald w 
helmich were accused of improper supervision 
barley of windermere fla agreed to pay a 35000 fine and a 
30day suspension of his registration helmich of longwood fla 
agreed to a twoweek ban from supervisory work 
in addition to the 220000 civil penalty shearson agreed to 
improve its recordkeeping procedures 
in the other action the cftc accused craig h bell of 
muttontown ny mark b dickstein and george j fox jr both of 
new york of engaging in 19 noncompetitive trading in silver 
futures between march and october 1987 
they were among the latest individuals named in administrative 
actions stemming from a federal investigation last year into 
potential trading abuses at some of the commodity futures exchanges 
in new yorks world trade center 
it is not the first one and we do not expect it to be the 
last said dennis klejna chief of the cftcs enforcement

here are excerpts from a sentencing memorandum 
by michael milkens defense lawyers to us district judge kimba m 
wood released tuesday in advance of his scheduled sentencing on 
oct 1 
the memorandum outlines milkens personal background business 
activities at drexel burnham lambert inc the nature of his 
offenses a proposal to sentence him and a rebuttal to government 
charges to which he hasnt pleaded guilty 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
michael milkens unusual talents and compassion became obvious 
at an early age by the first grade michael could perform 
complicated multiplications in his head and he received the 
highest grades in his classes 
michaels work ethic also became evident at an early age 
beginnning at the age of 10 michael helped in his fathers 
accounting office at first sorting checks and performing 
ministerial functions later reconciling checkbooks and assisting 
in the preparation of tax returns 
by the time michael was 30 he had earned vast sums of 
money but as everyone who knows him confirms the accumulation of 
money and material goods has never motivated michael 
until the publicity surrounding this investigation began 
not even his closest friends and colleagues had any idea of the 
extent of his wealth or for that matter the vast sums of money 
michael gave away to charities in stark contrast to the rich and 
famous lifestyles led by other financiers michael eschewed 
conspicuous consumption he lives in a comfortable but not 
extravagant home in encino his children receive a weekly 
allowance he prefers to spend his evenings with his family 
michael is actively involved in all aspects of his 
childrens life he helps his children with their homework he 
rarely misses a school function or a doctors appointment michael 
has even coached his boys basketball teams 
as the court can well imagine michaels greatest 
punishment is his knowledge that by virtue of his offenses his 
children have suffered greatly and are living with the nightmare 
that they may become separated from their father who has been a 
continual presence throughout their lives and upon whom they are 
deeply dependent 
michael milken will live for the rest of his life with the 
knowledge that he has inflicted enormous emotional and physical 
pain upon his wife and his children whom he loves more than 
anything else in the world for him this punishment is more severe 
than any this court could possibly impose 
michael has immersed himself in philanthropy having 
volunteered thousands of hours to assist charities and community 
organizations around the world 
michael milkens lifetime of charitable work cannot negate 
his criminal conduct but it can serve to underscore that his 
offenses stand in sharp contrast to the philanthropic values he has 
displayed throughout his life 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
michael strove through the use of innovative capital 
structures to provide financing to companies previously denied 
access to capital the sincerity of michaels business beliefs and 
the goals he set for himself are central to an understanding of 
both the offender and the context in which the offenses occurred 
by 1985 michaels business day was devoted both to 
supervising the numerous researchers traders and salespersons in 
the multibilliondollar highyield department and to talking on the 
phone and meeting with scores of customers and other drexel 
employees regarding the underwriting of millions of dollars of new 
securities his day began at approximately 430 am and ended at 
approximately 7 pm 
some have suggested that michael milken should be punished 
less for his offenses than for his role in pioneering highyield 
finance such suggestions are not only improper they are misguided 
as well people are perfectly entitled to call highyield 
securities junk bonds just as they are free to call shareholder 
rights plans poison pills but that does not make either 
illegal 
michael milkens highyield business prospered long before 
drexel ever financed a single hostile takeover michael was not in 
drexels mergers and acquisitions department and did not suggest 
targets for unsolicited takeovers in fact he often recommended 
against such maneuvers 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
michael should be sentenced based on the offenses to which he 
pleaded guilty he should not be sentenced for crimes that he did 
not commit he should not be sentenced on charges for which the 
government expressly has foregone prosecution in return for his 
guilty plea 
although inexcusable michaels offenses deletion were 
neither venal nor motivated by greed he did not personally profit 
by them they did not involve trading securities on the basis of 
inside information nor did these offenses infect the core of his 
business 
moreover the majority of offenses to which michael 
pleaded guilty had rarely if ever been subject to criminal 
prosecution at the time of michaels acts 
while michael aided and abetted in deferring payment of 
taxes michael himself has never improperly deferred or evaded any 
taxes that he owed to the contrary from 1984 through 1988 
michael paid approximately 750 million federal and state income 
taxes 
michael today recognizes the gravity of his actions he 
understands that no one especiallt someone in a position of 
leadership and trust can ever decide that it is permissible to 
commit acts no matter what ones motivation may be that violate 
the law michael milken is a changed person he will be tormented 
for the remainder of his life by the realization that his family 
was devastated his reputation destroyed and his lifes work 
tainted by virtue of his having committed these acts 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
if this court concludes that incarceration is required we urge 
that any period of confinement be brief consistent with the 
precedents in this district and that it be served in a halfway 
house or local facility deletion 
based on the sentencing principles developed in this 
district we propose that michael milken be sentenced to work 
fulltime with and under the direct supervision and control of 
the los angeles police department to develop and participate in 
specific educational and vocational programs designed to combat the 
problems of drugs crime unemployment and illiteracy threatening 
to destroy the lives of innercity youth in los angeles 
the proposed sentence fully satisfies the goals of 
punishment and general deterrence although the sentence imposed by 
this court must serve to punish michael for the crimes to which he 
has pleaded guilty and must strive to deter others similarly 
situated from committing these and similar crimes the goals of 
sentencing need not always be achieved through incarceration 
the retributive purpose of punishment has also been served 
in this case by michaels agreement to pay a 200 million criminal 
fine and establish a 400 million civil settlement fund moreover 
these unprecedented amounts are not the limit of michaels economic 
exposure his remaining assets are vulnerable to the more than 50 
civil lawsuits that already have been commenced against him and 
others seeking billions of dollars in damages michael may well 
spend the remainder of this century defending these and future 
lawsuits

desoto inc is asking shareholders to approve 
a plan to sell off most of the manufacturers assets and terminate 
its pension plans in return for a onetime dividend of 3550 per 
share 
in documents filed with the securities and exchange commission 
and disclosed tuesday desoto outlined its list of issues for 
shareholders to vote on at the companys annual meeting oct 24 in 
chicago 
among them des plaines illbased desoto wants shareholder 
approval of a restructuring under which the company would sell 
substantialy all of its businesses including its domestic 
consumer paint business which has supplied sears roebuck and co 
for 80 years 
the companys detergent business would be the only operation 
retained by desoto which has been battling a hostile takeover by a 
new york investment group sutton holding corp 
desoto estimated that the partial liquidation and restructuring 
would raise about 222 million before taxes with 85 million 
earmarked to retire corporate debt 
the remainder would go toward paying a special cash dividend of 
3550 per share but desoto conceded that there was no 
assurance it would be able to pay the cash dividend 
it noted that its plan to terminate pension plans and recover 
some 28 million in excess assets is subject to approval by the 
internal revenue service and the pension benefit guaranty corp the 
federal agency that guarantees workers pensions much like the 
federal deposit insurance corp guarantees bank deposits

one witness invoked the fifth amendment 14 times 
and another refused to appear voluntarily as a hearing began 
tuesday on conflictofinterest allegations against neil bush the 
presidents son 
outside the federal courthouse was surrounded by news media 
security officers and protesters 
the only thing missing in the savings and loan case was the 
center of all the attention 
neil bush 35 did not show up for the first day of what is 
anticipated to be a fourday proceeding before administrative law 
judge daniel j davidson 
he has the option of being here he only has to be here the 
day he testifies said office of thrift supervision spokesman tom 
mason bush is the last witness and is expected to testify at the 
end of the week 
the federal office of thrift supervision is trying to bar bush 
from the banking and savings industry for his alleged actions as a 
director of silverado banking savings and loan which failed in 
late 1988 at a cost to taxpayers of 1 billion 
at tuesdays hearing michael wise silverados former board 
chairman and chief executive officer invoked his fifth amendment 
right to refuse to answer questions on the grounds that he could 
incriminate himself 
davidson then allowed him the opportunity to testify in his 
chambers in order that wise be spared the ordeal of going through 
a futile gesture of taking the fifth 
but a transcript released later in the day showed wise still 
refused to answer any of the 14 questions he was asked those 
questions ranged from whether he could identify exhibits to his 
knowledge of bushs business ties to two denver developers who 
eventually defaulted on silverado loans exceeding 130 million 
wise also declined to speak with reporters as he left the 
judges chambers 
meanwhile florian barth a former silverado board member and a 
denver car dealer announced tuesday he refused to testify 
voluntarily 
the judge said he would sign a subpoena to bring barth to court 
if either side requested one at the end of the day ots officials 
said they hadnt yet requested one 
federal regulators accused bush last february of violating his 
duty as a silverado director from august 1985 to august 1988 the 
ots claims bush may have improperly voted on loans and lines of 
credit for developers kenneth good and bill walters both of whom 
contributed to bushs jnb exploration oil company the two 
defaulted on silverado loans totaling more than 130 million 
last week bush and other former silverado directors also were 
sued for 200 million by the federal deposit insurance corp the 
lawsuit alleged that gross negligence on the part of silverado 
directors contributed to the sampls collapse 
bush could have avoided this weeks hearing by agreeing not to 
dispute the charges as other sampl officials have done by fighting 
the government he has taken the case into a rare public forum 
russell murray former silverado executive vice president was 
the first scheduled witness to actually testify tuesday 
he reviewed a 1986 proposal for a 900000 line of credit for 
good international inc which wanted to search for oil in 
argentina with bushs jnb as a partner 
murray said he did not recall anyone questioning the 
nocollateral line of credit even though good and bush had a 
business relationship 
he indicated the line of credit was for show only to impress 
argentine officials 
murray said he knew bush and good had a business relationship 
he said he discussed the request for a line of credit with bush 
good and wise and then wrote a memo to the directors about the 
relationship before the line of credit was approved 
he said he did not have all the details of the relationship and 
that he would have asked for an opinion from counel if he had had 
all the facts 
later j donald wright chairman of the board of lakewood bank 
and trust of dallas was called by the government as an expert 
witness to give his opinion of bushs role in approving 100 
million in loans to walters walters had invested 150000 in 
bushs company and his bank gave bushs company a 175 million 
line of credit 
mr bush should have disclosed his relationship with mr 
walters when the silverado board voted on the loans said wright 
he was obligated to mr walters it would have been difficult 
to move to defeat mr walters loan he said mr bush is 
responsible for that judgment 
the judge has until dec 6 to recommend a ruling to ots director 
timothy ryan who has until april 8 to decide whether to impose the 
sanctions bush could appeal
