a state textbook committee on wednesday rejected 
a reading series opposed by fundamentalists because of references 
to ghosts and scary themes like child abandonment the publisher 
called the vote censorship 
its a blessing proclaimed eric coloney a peachtree city 
parent opposed to the impressions reading series 
the 138 vote against the series virtually assures that most 
school systems will not use it the state board of education will 
make final decisions in november schools can use books that arent 
on the approved state list but must use local funds to buy them 
several committee members expressed disappointment at the vote 
against the series which publisher harcourt brace jovanovich inc 
designed as an innovative reading program for teachers it uses the 
socalled whole language approach in which pupils study real 
childrens literature rather than sample paragraphs and phonics 
exercises 
i do feel like the specialinterest people influenced the 
textbook selection process said committee member lynne donehoo 
a bibb county counselor 
mrs donehoo said that when parents and teachers in her area 
reviewed impressions none objected to the content 
but with the highprofile complaints against the series 
including 190 opposition phone calls to the state department of 
education in recent days committee members took a harder look at 
the series she said 
only 22 of 822 stories mention ghosts or goblins and most of 
the troubling issues raised in the stories from adoption to 
sexism to witchcraft are addressed constructively in the 
teachers manual said jan spalding director of sales support 
services for harcourt brace 
selections ranging from laura ingalls wilders little house on 
the prairie to speeches from martin luther king jr both of 
which appear in the books got little attention as the committee 
focused on witches child abandonment chants and scary 
pictures she said 
joyce washingtonbray a reading specialist in marietta and 
member of the state committee that voted against the books said 
the content could detract from teaching 
when its this stuff about outer space material that is eerie 
that muddies it up for thinking and reading ms 
washingtonbray said 
said pat turner an assistant principal from americus city 
schools in some ways id say we just went through a witch 
hunt

violent crime racial tensions korean grocery 
boycotts at least mayor david dinkins has a fighting chance 
against them but what are the options when youre under attack by 
an 85yearold saintinwaiting 
that public relations nightmare is now reality for dinkins who 
was ripped this week by the heroic mother clara hale over a city 
policy that has kept children out of her nationally known group 
care nursery for the past year 
the city now requires placement of infants in foster care 
rather than in group centers such as hale house the decision is 
costing the harlem center 30000 to 36000 per month in city 
subsidies clouding its financial future 
mrs hale has charged the mayor is doing what white leaders tell 
him dinkins the citys first black mayor asserts he acted 
independently and adds that he cant believe that comment was ever 
made 
this is what happens when they give a black man a job he does 
what the white man tells him to do the 85yearold black woman 
told the new york times contacted at a manhattan hospital where 
she checked in last week with chest pains she did not back off 
that statement 
dinkins expressed disbelief when asked about the remark 
thats just not true i dont bow to anybody said dinkins 
whose wife joyce was the host for mother hales birthday party at 
gracie mansion earlier this year 
i doubt mother hale said that if i heard mother hale say it 
i wouldnt believe mother hale said it thats not our 
relationship 
mother hales credentials are many more than 800 drugaddicted 
infants have passed through her brownstone since 1969 president 
reagan hailed her as an american hero on national television 
five years ago today she still helps care for the babies she 
calls her children 
mother hales care may be special but the city position one 
echoed by experts is that foster homes are better for the 
children than group care centers the city hasnt placed a child at 
hale house since october 1989 
hale houses operators believes the success of their program 
speaks louder than any expert on whats best for the children they 
attempted to explain their position to dinkins but became 
infuriated when their first meeting was rescheduled and the second 
lasted less than five minutes 
the meeting failed to change the mayors mind and put hale house 
on the offensive although dinkins has offered to provide city 
funds to it for other programs in an effort to keep it open 
when reagan praised mother hale five years ago her center on 
west 122nd street was 70 percent government funded today it is 
twothirds subsidized by private contributions said jesse devor 
public relations consultant for hale house 
devor said it was only the centers good name that allowed it to 
continue operating if it wasnt for our visibility and our track 
record wed be dead right now its a crisis but were still 
viable 
there are 10 children staying at hale house which has space for 
15 the length of the stay varies from child to child it can be as 
short as a few months as long as two years depending on the 
rehabilitation of the parent or parents 
with an eye to the future hale house is pumping up its fund 
raising backers plan to distribute 100000 bumper stickers reading 
the city says no we say yes support hale house 
while the dinkins administration has sweated out the story 
republican leaders quickly turned up the heat a member of national 
drug czar william bennetts staff wasted no time in criticizing the 
democratic mayors position 
i dont know of many places like hale house in the nation and 
not to use it is dreadful said herb kleber deputy director of 
demand reduction for the office of national drug control 
mother hales position was echoed by the city sun a blackowned 
brooklyn newspaper that questioned the citys motives in this 
instance is it because some people in government dont think 
black and latino children are worth saving asked an editorial 
dinkins responded simply that the charges are not so before 
they needed that kind of group care they have plenty of foster 
care today foster families are deemed to be an eminently 
superior method of caring for children

a nasa team trying to pinpoint 
columbias dangerous hydrogen leaks has narrowed the list of 
possible sources to 83 
any combination might actually be the culprit said william 
lenoir head of nasas space flight program 
a hydrogen buildup in the shuttles engine compartment during 
fueling last week forced nasa to call off its fourth attempt to 
send columbia on an astronomy mission three of the postponements 
were caused by hydrogen leaks 
the shuttle is grounded until all leaks are found and fixed a 
ninemember investigative team assigned to the problem is 
scrutinizing every item in columbias crowded engine compartment as 
a possible source of leaks 
even if the first thing they do is find a big roaring leak 
they will worry about how do we fix that leak but they will 
continue everywhere else to look for things that might also be 
leaking lenoir said wednesday 
workers will remove insulation from each suspected part and then 
flush the system with nonflammable roomtemperature helium 
lenoir said 
if no leaks are found the process will be repeated with a 
different crew and equipment to be absolutely sure we havent 
missed anything he said 
so far columbias leaks have appeared only when the shuttles 
external tank is filled with highly flammable liquid hydrogen at 
supercold temperatures which might cause shrinkage of a metal 
part and form the leak 
to test for that possibility the external tank will twice be 
filled with cold liquid hydrogen around midoctober and in 
november about a dozen tv cameras will be placed inside the engine 
compartment for both tests 
nasa meanwhile is working to send discovery aloft oct 6 with 
a satellite to study the suns poles the shuttle must fly within 
the following 2 weeks or else wait more than a year for the 
planets to be in the right alignment 
the space agency plans no tanking test for discovery the only 
shuttle in which hydrogen leaks have not been found such a check 
would take five days 
a tanking test will be performedon atlantis before its early 
november flight hydrogen leaks were detected on the spacecraft in 
june 
lenoir said that he is hopeful columbia can be back on track in 
december but that there is no timetable 
theyre not driven by schedule they are to go out and find 
the leak find all of the leaks and then we can get on with it 
he said

he walked into the bank wearing his 
crash helmet and told a teller to put the cash in a plastic bag 
then he fired one shot from his 38caliber smith and wesson pistol 
into the ceiling strolled out and vanished on his red motorcycle 
bikerbank had struck for the 19th time 
they seek him here they seek him there and the public looks on 
enthralled by the cool precision that characterizes his crimes 
state television has done a primetime report on his exploits 
the daily hadashot is running a series of articles trying to 
pierce the mystery of the man hiding behind the nickname and the 
dark visor an excommando a former policeman theories abound 
his adversary is a tough mustachioed detective known to 
colleagues as shogun he is deputy superintendent chaim pinchas 
head of special investigations in the tel aviv force 
shoguns prestige is at stake bikerbank has robbed 19 banks in 
12 towns in 21 months leaving no clue and description just one 
fingerprint that draws a blank in the police computer 
he strikes between 10 am and noon he always robs the teller 
nearest to the door hes about 6 feet tall wears cowboy boots 
and according to some witnesses has a slight limp he rides a 
highpowered suzuki motorcycle 
bikerbanks loot so far totals slightly more than 150000 
he took out a gun showed it to everybody and shouted 
this is a robbery he went straight for the counter reuven 
avraham an official at a bank leumi branch in suburban tel aviv 
recalled on israel television 
he did not care whether we pushed the buttons or used silent 
alarm systems i think he was there no longer than a minute and a 
half avraham said 
officers have spent hours on stakeouts and roadblocks dozens of 
bikers have been questioned some adorn their helmets and bikes 
with stickers proclaiming im not the robber 
at least four suspects including a reserve air force officer 
have been held vehicle registry records have been no help and it 
is believed his bike was bought from a tourist and not registered 
when bikerbank first struck in february 1989 the customer 
behind him thought it was a joke and interfered forcing the robber 
to flash his pistol and fire in the air 
today his actions are completely professional he knows 
where to find the weak spots of the police investigator pinchas 
said 
i dont think he has a criminal background i think he comes 
from a good family either he saw a lot of movies or had 
contact with criminals and decided to go along this way amnon 
halper a former senior detective told israel army radio 
to compound police embarrassment bikerbank twice has struck 
while suspects were being held 
at some stage he began to provoke the police it has 
become something beyond robbery pinchas says 
if the public is not outraged by bikerbank it may be because it 
hasnt forgiven the banks for the 1983 stock market crash that 
wiped out many peoples savings israelis blame the banks for 
manipulating the prices of their own shares to keep them 
artificially high 
the robbers nickname ofnobank is an acronym of the hebrew 
words for biker and bank a play on the catchy acronyms the banks 
use to advertise their services 
some in the public have some sympathy for the man but we have 
to remember its a real robbery a weapon is being used and its a 
serious violation of the law says police minister roni milo 
still as long as bikerbank doesnt shoot anyone his scampish 
image is likely to endure 
i think the sympathy would be the same if he robbed government 
ministries or post offices anything linked to the establishment 
said noam pinto a spokesman for bank hapoalim 
its very frightening pinto said so far nobody has been 
hurt but we worry for the safety of the workers and the public 
the workers are under orders to hand out the money without 
provoking or opposing him 
shogun vows 
i will get him it does not matter if he continues or stops 
one day we will get him

magellans latest pictures of venus show 
meteorite craters the size of los angeles a river of solidified 
lava 200 miles long and a collapsed volcano twice as deep as the 
grand canyon 
these are extremely jazzy images said gordon pettengill a 
massachusetts institute of technology scientist who leads the 
spacecrafts radar science team 
nasa displayed the pictures of the cloudcovered planet at the 
jet propulsion laboratory on tuesday 
believe me its giving us a revolutionary new view of 
venus said brown university geologist jim head a magellan 
scientist 
with magellan only 10 days into its 243day mission to map the 
planet head advised dont touch your dial we think we have a 
blockbuster fall season 
steve saunders magellans chief scientist displayed a 
computergenerated videotape of threedimensional images showing 
venus from the perspective of someone swooping down to and around a 
crater on its surface 
magellan started its 744 million picture and mapmaking 
mission sept 15 two weeks later than planned because engineers 
temporarily lost radio contact with the spacecraft twice in august 
one picture displayed tuesday shows two volcanoes each with a 
windblown fan of debris extending about six miles from the 
mountains summit crater nasa said the fans look like fallout 
from volcanic explosion plumes 
while magellan hasnt seen a volcano actually erupting it has 
made pictures of so many volcanic features that there is an 
excellent possibility there is active volcanism somewhere on the 
planet head said 
magellan also spotted a caldera or crater caused by the 
collapse of a volcanos summit almost two miles deep roughly 
twice the depth of the grand canyon and deeper than any other 
caldera seen in the solar system scientists said 
a hardened lava river eighttenths of a mile wide and about 200 
miles long was mapped by magellan as well 
nasa also showed a picture of a meteorite impact crater about 28 
miles wide greater los angeles would fit approximately in the 
floor of this crater head said 
another picture showed three big impact craters one of them 
even larger with a width of about 30 miles 
magellan was launched from the space shuttle atlantis in may 
1989 and arrived at venus after traveling a looping path of 948 
million miles 
chief engineer john slonski jr said a backup computer that 
played a role in the radio blackouts still malfunctions 
occasionally so contact might be lost again 
the cause of the problems remains unknown suspicion focuses on 
possible damage to electronic components that happened when 
magellan started orbiting venus aug 10 and on static in the wiring 
linking its computers slonski said

carnegie hall tonight begins a seasonlong 
celebration of its 100th birthday secure as a centerpiece of 
american culture one generation after it nearly fell victim to the 
wreckers ball 
the auditorium on west 57th street still sparkling from a 50 
million facelift four years ago will be host in the coming months 
to the best and brightest of the music world from pops to placido 
domingo from jazz to jessye norman 
opening night honors go to the los angeles philharmonic 
conductor andre previn and violinist itzhak perlman the second 
night also by the orchestra will present the first of 13 pieces 
of music commissioned by carnegie for its centennial season thats 
the largest number of commissioned works ever in one season by an 
american presenting organization 
the second night premiere will be angelus based on the 
chiming of bells and composed by steven stucky last december a 
month before he was 85 sir michael tippett completed 
byzantium which will have its premiere in april by the chicago 
symphony with conductor sir georg solti making his final visit to 
carnegie as music director of that orchestra 
its probably the most extraordinary season that any hall has 
ever had violinist isaac stern said 
stern has been president of carnegie hall since 1960 when he 
saved it from the fate of being torn down so an office building 
could rise on the corner of 57th street and 7th avenue 
carnegie hall when youre playing in form makes a 
performance larger than life its an enormously powerful hall and 
it does give even average performers a glamour and power they 
wouldnt have in other halls stern said in an interview shortly 
before his 70th birthday in july 
carnegie was the place where you came to prove whether you 
belonged or not for that reason it was very necessary to play 
there it still is it has been the crown proving place for 
every single orchestra every one every conductor every pianist 
singer violinist cellist jazz player comedian pop singer 
andrew carnegie donated 2 million approximately ninetenths of 
the cost of construction but it was leopold damrosch founder of 
both the symphony society the citys second orchestra after the 
new york philharmonic and the oratorio society who felt new york 
needed another large hall besides the metropolitan opera his son 
walter music director of both organizations in 1887 happened to 
sail that year on the same ship as carnegie and his bride who were 
on their honeymoon by the time the ship reached europe carnegie 
had agreed to build a fine concert hall in new york 
ten concerts starting april 26 will lead up to the centennial 
date itself may 5 the day will start with a morning concert by 
eight choruses conducted by robert shaw the new york philharmonic 
conducted by zubin mehta and leonard bernstein will perform at 4 
pm take a dinner break and resume 
soloists at that concert will include sopranos leontyne price 
and miss norman mezzosoprano marilyn horne tenor domingo 
pianist rudolf serkin violinists stern and pinchas zukerman 
cellists mstislav rostropovich and yoyo ma and the empire brass 
quintet 
carnegie hall is the center from which the entire development 
of american music came stern said nothing happened in this 
country that didnt come through carnegie 
the hall has been acclaimed throughout its history for its 
architecture and acoustics 
during the most recent renovation workmen closed a hole that 
had been cut in the ceiling over the stage for a movie in the 
1940s that and some other changes prompted some critics to 
complain that the halls warm acoustics had been damaged in 
response a row of freestanding panels was built that can be 
placed along the back wall behind orchestras 
whats important to stern is that carnegie hall now restored 
as much as possible to its 1891 look with airconditioning 
improved and less street noise coming in stands for another 100 
years 
its something to hold on to some connection with mans 
involvement with education with the quality of civilization those 
are the things which are worthwhile

editors note this report is one of a series on the german 
countdown to unity on oct 3 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
guenter grass and other authors are 
among the last holdout opponents to unification firing salvos of 
dissent that have not damaged the unity express but have fractured 
the german intelligenstia 
the debate has triggered a furious philosophical feud over 
whether star east german writers like christa wolf indirectly 
bolstered the hardline communist state by not actively opposing 
it 
some leftist german writers have charged that the real 
beneficiaries of unification are not the common people but 
businessmen and politicians who stand to reap financial and 
political profits 
but many critics maintain that grass and other members of 
germanys mostly leftist literary pantheon are hopelessly out of 
touch with the rest of the population 
the foremost feature of these people is an unbelievable 
vanity enno von loewenstern editorial writer for the 
conservative die welt newspaper said in an interview if the 
common folk refuse to follow their line they have not wakened to 
their true consciousness 
conservative writers from both germanys have expressed similar 
views 
the debate began soon after the first cracks appeared in the 
berlin wall last fall 
wolf novelist stefan heym and other east germans published a 
manifesto warning against a sellout of material and moral 
values to their rich west german neighbors 
the message was that east germany with a new democratic 
government and freedom for the people was something worth 
preserving 
west german critics asked why the same east german intellectuals 
hadnt been as loud with critical pronouncements during stalinist 
rule 
the ultimate question was had east german intellectuals 
acquiesced to the repressive rule for the special privileges 
bestowed upon artists and writers 
the debate turned angrier when wolf published an 
autobiographical novella called what remains in which she 
suggested she had been hounded by the stasi secret police in the 
late 1970s 
a critic for die welt questioned whether wolf has the right to 
portray herself as a martyr because she had to endure three stasi 
observers sitting in a car across from her apartment 
many people have lived through this and worse the 
critic said 
grass and other leftist west german authors have rushed to 
wolfs defense 
he has compared the campaign against wolf to an inquisition and 
said it could do irreparable damage to the german intellectual 
community 
grass has accused wolfs critics of hypocrisy pointing out that 
no one seemed to mind during the communist years that her status 
allowed her to deliver readings and lectures to enrapt listeners 
and reviewers in the west 
the debate goes beyond whether east german intellectuals chose a 
cozy life under communist rule over trying to bring about real 
change 
at the heart of all the arguing is unification itself 
this spring millions of east germans loudly voiced their 
support for unification by shouting we are one people at 
election rallies 
german intellectuals heard the cry but many leftist writers say 
unity is a mistake 
grass evoking the third reich and auschwitz at one point said 
a united germany would be a danger to itself and other nations 
in in interview in early september grass said he favored a 
confederation between the two germanys but not unification 
the previous united german state lasted briefly from 
bismarck to 1945 it was only 70 years and was the unhappiest phase 
in all of german history and in european history as well he 
said 
east german heiner mueller one of europes bestknown 
playwrights and a diehard socialist says the germans destiny has 
been taken from their hands by west german chancellor helmut kohl 
the architect of unification 
whats happening now is an economic conquest of east 
germany he said 
other intellectuals disagree 
martin walser the west german novelist said the east germans 
do control their destiny they could have chosen to create a free 
socialist state as he points out was favored by many 
intellectuals 
i would have said ok if thats what you believe walser 
said in a recent newspaper interview but the people decided on 
something else 
reiner kunze a leading poet who was thrown out of east germany 
in 1977 has scolded grass for his views no one needs to fear 
germany kunze said 
west german patrick sueskind author of the bestselling novel 
perfume has written a new book titled fear of germany in 
which he takes aim at the hoopla and hype accompanying unification 
he said the idea of unity has taken his generation of postwar 
babyboomers by surprise 
we thought we had a grasp on our existence and understood the 
world and now were suddenly confronted with this midlife 
crisis sueskind writes 
we were prepared for impotence for prostate problems false 
teeth menopause for cancer death and the devil but 
definitely not for deutschlandeinigvaterland 
the phrase means germany united fatherland a favorite 
chant at east german election rallies this year

house negotiators are reported near agreement 
on legislation to extend the life of the national endowment for the 
arts and let the courts decide whether its grant recipients have 
violated obscenity laws 
i think were going to get a deal said rep pat williams 
dmont a central figure in house bargaining over the fate of the 
embattled federal arts agency 
in an interview tuesday williams predicted that lengthy talks 
with rep e thomas coleman rmo will yield a compromise on the 
obscene art issue that will attract the support of a solid 
majority of house members 
he said the compromise is likely to be patterned after a formula 
the senate labor and human resources committee approved last week 
with strong bipartisan backing 
the senate bill would require the nea to recoup grant money from 
artists who are convicted of using federal funds to produce works 
that violate obscenity laws the guilty artists would be barred 
from receiving further nea grants for at least three years 
on thursday the house tentatively plans to begin what promises 
to be a bruising floor battle over a proposed fiveyear extension 
of the arts endowment whose statutory authority expires sunday 
lawmakers readied no fewer than two dozen amendments most of 
them seeking to prohibit nea support for works that might be 
considered obscene or sacrilegious one proposal would abolish the 
arts endowment altogether 
strict antiobscenity curbs imposed on the endowment last fall 
at the urging of sen jesse helms rnc also will lapse next 
week when the current fiscal year ends unless congress renews them 
in some form 
in a related development the house appropriations committee on 
tuesday rebuffed an attempt by its chairman rep jamie whitten 
dmiss to recommend forbidding the nea to finance any indecent 
antireligious or obscene picture play or writing 
on a voice vote the committee eliminated whittens nonbinding 
proposal from a stopgap bill intended to keep the federal 
government operating at current spending levels for the first three 
weeks of the new fiscal year until oct 20 and to provide 2 
billion for us military operations in the persian gulf 
the effect of the bill later approved and sent to the house 
floor was to continue the nea temporarily at the level of its 
current 171 million budget with the helms antiobscenity curbs 
intact 
rep sidney yates dill argued that whittens antiobscenity 
proposal should be considered later when the committee acts on the 
neas proposed 180 million appropriations bill for next year 
the prospective compromise between williams and coleman 
opposing figures in the nea controversy would leave to the courts 
not the endowment the responsibility for deciding whether 
federally subsidized works are obscene 
coleman previously had proposed forbidding the nea from 
supporting works that meet the supreme courts obscenity standards 
the helms ban went further prohibiting support for any works that 
may be considered obscene including depictions of 
homoeroticism sadomasochism and sexual exploitation of children 
williams said another coleman proposal to shift 60 percent of 
nea grant money to the control of state arts agencies remains in 
dispute he said the compromise bill may include a limited increase 
in the 20 percent of grant funds currently allocated to the states 
colemot return calls seeking comment 
williams a staunch nea supporter is chief sponsor of the bush 
administrations original bill to extend the neas life for five 
years without any antiobscenity restrictions 
congressional sources said the house probably would vote for a 
shorter extension perhaps three or four years to allow congress 
more frequent reviews of nea operations 
rep dick armey rtexas expressed support tuesday for a 
proposed amendment by rep phil crane rill that would abolish 
the nea armey said he found abhorrent the very existence of a 
politically appointed government panel charged with determining 
what art is worthy of funding

how long can a nation embroiled in a costly 
military standoff endure harsh economic sanctions not iraq the 
united states 
americans may get a chance to find out as early as monday if 
congress and the white house fail to reach a budget agreement 
no one calls them sanctions but the automatic spending cuts 
that would be triggered under the grammrudman law could have some 
of the same consequences possible food shortages massive 
transportation disruptions and a heavy drain on economic growth 
these are selfinflicted sanctions that are written into the law 
intended to lead to a balanced federal budget by 1993 
the impact of the cuts from 85 billion to 100 billion 
combined with higher energy prices resulting from the middle east 
crisis could easily topple the us economy into a recession many 
economists suggest 
and thats even before the 1billionamonth cost of the 
persian gulf military operation is factored in 
with the budget talks deadlocked president bush is giving no 
signs of blinking first in what rep silvio conte rmass says 
is a game of chicken thats all it is 
bush was quick on tuesday to show he wont go along with a 
democraticled effort to delay the spending targets at least until 
oct 20 to give budget negotiators more breathing room 
shortly after the house appropriations committee approved 
stopgap legislation calling for such a delay bush told reporters 
i will veto any spending measure that suspends grammrudman 
and budget discipline 
white house officials say they are bracing for the spending cuts 
to take effect monday 
although perennial financial crises in washington have a solid 
history of evaporating in 11thhour compromises some key 
presidential aides have said privately that this time the 
resolution may not come until after spending cuts actually take 
hold 
at the same time officials say bush has no plans to curtail his 
plans to travel extensively around the country in october 
campaigning for republican candidates even if the spending cuts 
take place 
bush who is off today for two days of campaigning in the 
midwest has scheduled campaign trips for oct 45 10 1516 and 
2528 
however he may have to do it without part of his staff and he 
may find it difficult to travel at night 
most of the nations 22 million federal employees already have 
been warned they may be furloughed to a shorter work week beginning 
next week including most white house employees 
the national weather service has said it will close 250 weather 
stations from 6 pm to 6 am beginning monday in the absence of a 
budget agreement including those that provide local weather 
information to pilots 
that combined with plans by the federal aviation administration 
to sharply cut back on the number of air traffic controllers could 
keep most flights grounded at night 
and if you think that sounds draconian you aint seen nothing 
yet said white house spokesman marlin fitzwater 
noting that the grammrudman cuts will force a 40 percent 
acrosstheboard cutback in most government programs fitzwater 
said youre going to see a lot more dramatic and difficult 
things to deal with than night flights 
administration budget officials have said that imposition of the 
spending cuts also may delay medicare and social security checks 
and could result in food shortages because of reductions in 
government inspections 
they also say the cuts will mean fewer guards in prisons a halt 
to toxic waste sites elimination of pell grants to 12 million 
college students and reductions in programs for vaccinating 
children 
and fitzwater may not be on hand to brief reporters on these 
developments 
like the rest of his press office staff fitzwater has himself 
received a furlough notice secret service agents are among the 
few in the white house exempted 
basically in my office the way the furlough would work would 
be essentially everybody would be off one day a week for the first 
couple weeks and then two days a week for the next several weeks 
and so forth the press secretary said

the soviet union in an astonishing speech 
by foreign minister eduard a shevardnadze is suddenly in the 
forefront of the international drive against iraqi president saddam 
hussein while pushing relations with the united states to 
unprecedented heights 
the two superpowers are still haggling over arms control 
measures unless secretary of state james a baker iii achieves a 
sudden breakthrough today in a private meeting with shevardnadze 
two summits may have to be set back 
but with world attention riveted on the united nations and the 
precarious pressure campaign to force iraq to relinquish its 
conquest of kuwait shevardnadze has given president bush all the 
support he could hope to have and then some 
the genial georgian who sits at mikhail s gorbachevs right 
hand in the soviet power structure not only blasted saddam on 
tuesday as a terrorist threatening the new world order but 
suggested his seizure of kuwait might call for a war crimes trial 
those who take hostages employ torture and threaten other 
nations with destruction are engaged in crimes against humanity 
and should be judged by an international tribunal shevardnadze 
said 
moreover the soviet foreign minister raised the prospect of a 
un military force against iraq if the 7weekold economic 
blockade fails to induce saddam to give up the oilrich emirate 
the united nations has the power to suppress acts of 
aggression shevardnadze observed 
the first proposition conjured up images of the nuremberg trials 
of nazi leaders after world war ii the second carried echoes of 
president harry s trumans unsanctioned defense of south korea 
against aggression from the north 
significantly both proposals were sterner than any advanced by 
the bush administration in some ways shevardnadze vaulted past 
the united states in taking the moral high ground against baghdad 
it was a very strong speech canadian foreign minister joe 
clark said afterward it certainly indicates that we are in a new 
era of international affairs 
clark also complimented shevardnadze for the way he chaired 
tuesdays un security council session in which the body voted 
141 to impose an air embargo against iraq it is a dramatic 
demonstration of how much has changed internationally he said 
ussoviet relations have been on the upsurge for years but 
until the soviets withdrew their troops from afghanistan in 1988 
many in washington questioned the sincerity of gorbachevs moves 
even in this new era of good feelings the two sides still are 
struggling to resolve their differences over cutting longrange 
nuclear weapons and reducing their tanks and other conventional 
arms in europe 
failure to agree on nuclear cutbacks could imperil the trip bush 
hoped to take to moscow in december to sign a treaty slashing 
longrange arsenals of bombers submarines and intercontinental 
ballistic missiles the dispute over conventional forces could 
postpone the 35nation summit france proposed to host in paris in 
midnovember 
there is time to rescue both pacts in the meantime cooperation 
on coping with the crisis in the persian gulf is at a maximum 
when bush set out in early august to impose an economic 
stranglehold on saddam he encountered some hesitation from moscow 
soviet support was considered essential for several reasons 
first of all as a permanent member of the un security council 
the soviets could kill any measure against iraq second the united 
states needed the other superpowers support to persuade the world 
the campaign against iraq was not a solo show of force by 
washington 
third the credibility of the campaign would gain immensely if 
it had the support of the soviets since they had been allies of 
iraq 
the soviet hesitation on sanctions recurred in late august when 
the bush administration went back to the security council to 
enforce the sanctions 
again moscows anxieties about inflaming a touchy situation 
yielded to a judgment that saddam must be contained despite the 
risk 
two weeks ago bush and gorbachev agreed in helsinki finland 
that additional measures might be required the imposition of a 
un air blockade was the result 
not too many years ago the soviets were the targets of the sort 
of condemnation shevardnadze heaped on saddam their actions in 
eastern europe and treatment of their own people generated the kind 
of outrage now being visited on iraq 
but now as gorbachev struggles to transform the soviet union 
into a market economy with and to institute political democracy 
shevardnadze appealed to iraqs leaders to obey the demands of 
the law and also of plain common sense to take a responsible and 
human attitude 
he said the soviets are making the appeal as old friends of the 
iraqis 
shevardnadze said the soviets spoke also as a country that 
found the courage to condemn its own wrongdoings against certain 
states in the past 
such admissions are rare on the world diplomatic stage and they 
served to intensify the respect shevardnadze earned with his 
speech

the bridge of friendship over the danube 
once symbolized comradely communist ties between bulgaria and 
romania but its been a source of tension since authorities began 
cracking down on smugglers 
it can take as long as three days toget across the bridge 
between russe bulgaria and this town 60 miles south of bucharest 
heating up tempers and radiators alike 
under the two countries former communist governments lines 
were virtually nonexistent because travel and the opportunity for 
private trading were strictly limited 
all that changed after last years democratic upheaval 
the romanian and bulgarian economies are in chaos as new 
goverments start steering away from central planning and toward 
freemarket practices and romanians who face shortages of basic 
foods such as bread and sugar at home are going on shopping sprees 
in turkey 
they can even pick up some coffee in bulgaria through which 
they must travel on their way to turkey 
the goods are sold for a profit back home 
bulgarians whose economy has been sliding into deepening 
crisis face strict food rationing themselves 
in august bulgaria said romanians could travel within bulgaria 
only on organized tours or in transit to another point authorities 
cited a cholera epidemic in romania but many romanians believe the 
reason behind the clampdown was to stop illegal crossborder trade 
the state bulgarian news agency bta charged that in russe 
the romanians swear they are transit travelers however having 
struck quick bargains on the bulgarian black market they go back 
explaining their cars broke down 
in a recent televised speech romanian president ion iliescu 
attacked speculators who think the free market is a way to 
get rich quickly 
growing romanianbulgarian antipathy got a further boost when 
romanian television showed footage of bulgarian militiamen at the 
russe station beating romanians who didnt have correct papers and 
forcing them back across the border 
since summer lines at romanian customs have been growing and 
relations with sofia have started to strain 
seething soviet truck drivers now jockey daily with turkish 
emigrant workers and romanian unofficial traders for a place on the 
rickety 1mile bridge over the danube river 
experienced travelers arrive prepared with food drink and extra 
gasoline for the crossing 
at the giurgiu customs post recently a handful of officials 
no more than in the days of former dictator nicolae ceauscescu 
deliberately search every car and often confiscate hidden taxable 
goods 
smugglers offer cigarettes and whisky as bribes 
fights break out occasionally in the midday heat as drivers 
squabble about who should go first the lines trail back miles over 
the bridge and spew into the opposite lanes blocking the way to 
bulgaria 
bucharest officials say there are no plans to widen the 
40yearold bridge or add lanes to the customs crossing

baghdad has boosted its troop strength in 
kuwait and southern iraq by more than 50 percent over the past two 
weeks to a total of about 430000 men the pentagon says 
in the past week president saddam hussein has added 70000 
troops to the area following an increase of 95000 the previous 
week the pentagon said tuesday 
the united states has about 165000 troops in the persian gulf 
region 
separately a senior pentagon official disclosed that soviet 
military advisers in iraq are performing maintenance on iraqi 
aircraft behind the front lines 
the official speaking on condition he not be identified said 
us intelligence analysts believe that between 500 and 1000 
soviet advisers remain in iraq and that an undetermined number are 
helping maintain iraqs warplanes 
were not very sure about exactly what theyre doing in iraq 
beyond working on aircraft and performing unspecified training 
roles for the iraqi military the official said 
he added that withdrawal of the soviet advisers would not have 
much effect on iraqs military capabilities 
pete williams the pentagon spokesman said iraq has shifted 
mechanized forces back from kuwaits border with saudi arabia into 
tactical reserve positions they are being replaced on the 
front line with infantry units he said the result has been a 
large increase in the total number of troops in the area 
our analysts think that what theyre gaining is flexibility 
for the mechanized units williams said 
the spokesman said the reported increases in iraqi troops and 
tank deployments are partly due to the pentagon including a larger 
geographic area in its count williams said he could not estimate 
how much of the increase was due to this factor which he said 
reflected the wider deployment of mechanized forces 
williams said the iraqi deployments still appear to be 
essentially a defensive force but are capable of readily 
converting to an offensive strike force 
the number of iraqi tanks in the kuwait theater has jumped by 
700 from last week to 3500 tanks williams said and the number of 
armored personnel carriers has risen to 2500 an increase of 700 
artillery pieces now total about 1700 up by 250 
williams said the united states had no plan to increase its 
deployment of forces to saudi arabia as a result of the continuing 
iraqi buildup us forces are still flowing into the area

a week before key elections most 
brazilians seem apathetic about choosing a national congress and 
state governors 
the oct 3 election is the first since voters in december made 
fernando collor de mello brazils first freely elected president in 
29 years 
almost all 570 congressional seats are up for grabs as well as 
all 26 state governorships runoffs will be held in midnovember if 
no gubernatorial candidate receives an absolute majority in next 
wednesdays vote 
polls show the country is sharply divided on the collor 
administration still conservatives sympathetic to his freemarket 
economic reform are expected to win the majority of governors 
chairs 
the same outcome is being forecast on the congressional side 
even though polls show voters arent familiar with the candidates 
a recent survey in rio revealed 74 percent of the voters were 
undecided 
the lack of enthusiasm is striking compared with the 
populations high involvement in last years vote between collor 
and socialist luis inacio lula da silva 
some observers say that after 25 years of military dictatorship 
which ended in 1985 brazilians have had an overdose of 
democracy federal state or local elections have now been held in 
five of the last six years 
this accumulation of elections is going to transform the 
electoral process into something so routine and boring hat nobodys 
going to want to know anything about it said mario amato a 
business leader 
others say the apathy stems from a frustration with the last six 
years of civilian rule 
elected government was seen as the countrys salvation from 
misery and corruption and it was nothing of the sort said rep 
fabio feldman of the centerleft brazilian social democratic party 
grave problems are not resolved with miracles 
also dimming voter interest is widespread dirty campaigning in 
several states electoral courts temporarily suspended tv ads after 
mudslinging reached alarming proportions 
in rio opponents of leonel brizola heavily favored in the 
governors race bribed poor children with sweets and sandwiches to 
alter the words from his campaign song from lalalabrizola to 
blahblahblah brizola 
a film of the scene ran as tv spots for several nights before a 
judge banned the ad 
the countrys leftist parties once expected to benefit from 
voter anger about collors tough economic austerity measures are 
suffering most from the voter apathy 
they depend more on active participation from their supporters 
than do the largely moneydriven campaigns of most conservatives 
analysts say the opposition has also hurt by internal squabbles 
after uniting behind da silvas candidacy last year leftist 
alliances disintegrated new coalitions may emerge only for 
secondround governors races 
the left has been totally incompetent said political 
observer david fleischer it has failed to recover 
psychologically from last years presidential defeat and is blowing 
its chance due to petty quarrels

south african president f w de klerk says 
the new system he envisions for his country will ensure that no 
racial group black or white will ever be able to achieve 
political domination again 
speaking to reporters hours before ending his official visit 
tuesday de klerk ruled out a winnertakeall electoral 
approach in which broad powers are granted to one person 
never again he said should there be a situation in which a 
powerful executive regardless of color is in a strong position 
to suppress south africans of different races 
de klerk said he foresees a new system in which there will be a 
sharing of power within the executive branch thus guarding against 
any concentration of authority 
during his threeday visit the first by a south african head of 
state since 1945 de klerk relentlessly sought to convince doubters 
in the united states that his country is embarking on a new era of 
democracy and racial equality 
i want to say here today that the time has come to realize 
that apartheid is really something of the past he said at a 
national press club luncheon 
as proof he said more than 100 discriminatory laws and 
regulations have been removed from the statute books he promised 
that the remaining impediments will be erased by the time a new 
constitution takes effect 
de klerk also said he was determined to avoid the chaos that has 
prevailed in many other african countries in the postindependence 
era 
we intend to ensure that our plan will absolutely and 
effectively prevent south africa from becoming just another typical 
african oneparty state sliding down the scale of poverty into 
oblivion he said 
we intend to ensure that the new south africa will be based on 
the very values which we share with you 
de klerk said the issue of us sanctions against south africa 
were discussed only indirectly in his talks with president bush 
secretary of state james a baker iii and congressional leaders 
i did not put forward any specific requests he said the 
sanctions among other things bar new us investment in south 
africa and forbid south african aircraft from landing in the united 
states 
rep william gray dpa the house majority whip and 
topranking black in congress said he came away hopeful from 
de klerks session with congressional leaders 
gray said he told de klerk that congress will not be ready to 
ease sanctions until south africa writes a new constitution 
removing the legal pillars of apartheid 
apartheid is alive and well and a reality and until there is a 
new constitution there will be no significant change in that 
society gray said 
asked about the impact of the sanctions de klerk said to a 
great extent it was counterproductive people under threat tend to 
react negatively we dont like as a country to be prescribed to by 
other countries and theres an emotional reaction which is brought 
about by that 
he said south africa began moving toward abandoning its 
apartheid system not because of the sanctions but because we 
believed it must be done 
we are going to do it whether the legislation was instituted 
or not we would have done it according to the policies which we 
have accepted he said 
de klerk has moved partway toward creating conditions that would 
permit the lifting of sanctions through a series of measures 
these include freeing african national congress leader nelson 
mandela and other political prisoners ending the state of 
emergency in all but one province lifting bans on democratic 
political parties and agreeing to negotiate a new democratic 
system

an unprecedented constitutional battle over a 
hated tax is shaping up between prime minister brian mulroneys 
conservativecontrolled house of commons and the liberal majority 
in the usually somnolent senate 
the object of the revilement the goods and services tax 
polls indicate 75 to 85 percent of canadians oppose the 7 
percent tax it will be imposed on nearly all merchandise and 
services beginning jan 1 on top of the existing provincial sales 
taxes which range from 8 to 10 percent 
that is if the senate doesnt kill it off 
the confrontation pits the elected house of commons against the 
unelected senate which canadians refer to with a snicker as 
parliaments chamber of sober second thought 
senate seats long have been used as payoffs for political 
service rendered and the chamber rarely has roused itself to do 
battle over burning issues of the day 
the socalled gst tax bill was approved by the house in march 
the government then proceeded with plans for collecting the tax as 
if its passage was a foregone conclusion ignoring claims that it 
is bafflingly complex 
one letter to the editor of the toronto globe and mail said the 
governments gst guide book for accountants is a nightmare 400 
pages and growing 
but suddenly last week liberal opposition leader jean chretien 
announced that his party would try to kill the measure in the 
senate on monday banking committee chairman sidney buckwold 
recommended that the senate kill the bill 
its a very bad piece of legislation that canadians by the 
millions asked the senate to reject and weve acted accordingly 
said buckwold 
we want to have a quick vote to kill the gst chretien said 
tuesday 
sensing growing resentment against the tax mulroney filled 15 
vacant senate seats with conservatives over the past month but 
that wasnt enough 
the liberals hold 52 seats in the 104seat chamber and the 
conservatives 46 the remaining seats are held by one reform party 
member and five independents 
the prime minister was said to be considering a resort to an 
obscure never used section of the constitution which would allow 
him to ask the queen to appoint up to eight extra senators that 
still would not guarantee success leaving the fate of the tax in 
the hands of the independents 
the 7 percent tax would replace the 135 percent manufacturers 
sales tax which raises about 10 billion a year but is considered 
inefficient and levied on a very narrow base 
the argument is that it the manufacturers sales tax 
discriminates heavily against manufacturing industries in canada 
and against canadian firms visavis imports said dr robin 
boadway a professor of economics at queens university and an 
expert on taxation 
the gst is essentially the same as the valueadded tax that 
the europeans use said boadway 
but consumers already paying 8 to 10 percent in provincial 
sales taxes are horrified at the prospect of seeing 15 to 17 
percent tacked on their purchases plumbing bills haircuts and 
music lessons 
manufacturers love it 
dismantling the existing federal sales tax would remove a 
longstanding source of competitive disadvantage for canadian 
manufacturers exporters and all businesses that compete with 
imports in the domestic canadian market said thomas daquino 
president of the canadian business council 
one of the main fears of the taxpaying public however is that 
once the tax has been implemented governments will be very tempted 
to hike the rate 
it has such a broad base it can raise a lot of revenue with 
small rate increases said boadway 
out in the tiny saskatchewan village of elstow population 140 
mayor brad cabanas town council has voted not to collect or pay 
the gst come what may 
its another example of government not listening to the 
people he said its not a fair tax and its quite 
inflationary

israeli analysts say they see little 
likelihood of palestinians launching a terrorist attack in support 
of saddam hussein unless war breaks out between iraq and the 
usled forces arrayed against it 
but they say palestinian militants are ready to do the iraqi 
presidents bidding and raise the possibility of palestinians 
acting separately to draw attention from the persian gulf crisis to 
their own plight 
the assessments come from anat kurz and david tal of the jaffee 
center for strategic studies a tel aviv university research group 
the two addressed a news conference tuesday presenting the centers 
survey of international terrorism in 1989 
tal pointed to statements by extremists on the fringes of the 
palestine liberation organization expressing readiness to act on 
iraqs behalf 
he also spoke of attempts by saddam to make contact with abu 
nidal the plo renegade behind some of the worst terrorist 
incidents of the 1980s 
however tal added so far we can say quite clearly that the 
palestinians and iraq are not going to initiate a spate of 
terrorism 
he doubted the mainstream plo wants to be involved in terrorism 
and said all palestinian declarations so far refer to a case in 
which a war or hostile activity erupts 
so i think the palestinians will turn to terrorism only if 
hostile activity starts he said 
tal said he was trying to assess the threat logically but of 
course i can never tell whether abu nidal will feel that this is 
the time to help saddam hussein even if saddam hussein doesnt 
know it 
ms kurz saw a growing danger of plo elements taking the 
initiative even if their attacks contradict the timing and 
interests of baghdad 
this could happen she said not out of solidarity with iraq but 
as an expression of frustration and an effort to bring back the 
palestinian issue and the intefadeh the antiisraeli uprising in 
the west bank and gaza strip back to the headlines 
the probability of this kind of threat seems to be increasing 
as long the gulf crisis becomes a protracted stalemate she 
said 
the centers report counted 406 incidents of international 
terrorism in 1989 compared with 433 in 1988 and 377 in 1987 
bombing and arson remained the most common tactics accounting 
for 49 percent of incidents armed assaults accounted for 355 
percent kidnappings for 59 percent and specific and concrete 
threats for 67 percent 
latin america suffered the most terrorism in 1989 39 percent 
of all incidents 
western europe accounted for 197 percent down from 242 
percent in 1988 
the report said 553 people were killed by international 
terrorism 278 of them by bombs planted on two planes one that 
blew up over the sahara and another in colombia 
trends changed little from 1988 it said political figures were 
targeted in 421 percent of attacks economic objectives in 32 
percent and the public in 226 percent

conductor carlos kleiber brought magic to 
strauss der rosenkavalier on the second night of the 
metropolitan operas season 
the english soprano felicity lott who has been singing opera 
regularly at covent garden made her met debut as the marschallin 
her voice is lovely though not large 
in fact all voices at the met on tuesday night seemed either 
small or held back one listened very much to the orchestra as 
kleiber brought out subthemes and made the music glow 
anne sofie von otter is the bestlooking octavian weve seen 
she is slim and straight and moves like a true young gentleman 
instead of the plummy mezzosoprano one is accustomed to in the 
part her voice is small and has a soprano quality with the 
addition of barbara bonney in act 2 as the young sophie the 
leading womens voices are all sweet unstrained a delight to 
listen to but too much alike 
the marschallin in act 1 thinks about losing her youth she 
does this in the wondering almost humorous way of a person 
thinking about it for the first time this is appropriate when the 
singer is as young and attractive as miss lott however it doesnt 
add the texture of deep human understanding that some sopranos 
whove sung the marschallin have given 
this der rosenkavalier was more a musical experience than an 
emotional one 
aage haugland who looked like charles laughton sang baron 
ochs he hit the high notes in act 1 and the low notes in act 2 
something that not every singer of the part can do he sounded as 
though he wasnt singing full voice 
the very stylish production designed by nathaniel merrill and 
robert ohearn dates from 1969 some of the staging has been 
changed ochs picked up sophie after he asks her to dance and swung 
her off her feet side to side several times there is now more 
dancing than before much of it by sarah walker and anthony 
laciura the italian intriguers 
juliana gondek a native of pasadena calif made her met debut 
in the small part of sophies duenna 
kleiber who lives near munich and picks and chooses what operas 
he will conduct decided in august that he was willing to conduct 
the first seven performances of der rosenkavalier he also 
decreed there be one not two dogs in the marschallins bedroom in 
act 1 
met artistic director james levine who had intended to conduct 
was able to relinquish that without breaking anybodys contract 
levine will conduct the performances next february and march 
in the performances of oct 4 9 17 and 20 luciano pavarotti 
will sing the one aria by act 1s italian singer

more than a decade after they were signed two 
cold warera treaties that limit the size of nuclear tests by the 
united states and the soviet union have won approval from the 
senate 
the two agreements now seem less significant than they did when 
they were negotiated by presidents nixon and ford but the means of 
verifying them recently worked out by president bush and soviet 
leader mikhail gorbachev have farreaching implications 
the senate voted 980 on tuesday to consent to ratification of 
the 1974 threshold test ban treaty and the 1976 peaceful nuclear 
explosions treaty lawmakers used the occasion to call for the 
eventual elimination of nuclear testing 
the treaties which limit underground explosions to 150 kilotons 
or less were delayed for years first because of efforts to seek a 
more comprehensive test ban then by misgivings over whether they 
could be adequately verified 
the latter doubts were largely erased by a new set of 
verification rules agreed to by bush and gorbachev on june 1 during 
their washington summit 
those rules a sign of the new trust between the two former 
adversaries provide for intrusive onsite verification each side 
may establish three seismic monitoring stations in the others 
territory 
soviet monitoring sites are in newport wash tulsa okla and 
in the black hills of south dakota us monitoring sites are in 
the ural mountains near moscow and in siberia 
sen william cohen rmaine the senior gop member of the senate 
intelligence committee cautioned that the soviets could use their 
monitoring teams for spying he urged that no inspections be 
permitted until security procedures are tightened 
other than the verification measures the two modest treaties 
lag far beyond current arms control reality which contemplates 
massive reductions in the us and soviet nuclear arsenals and 
sharp cuts in conventional forces 
supporters said the new verification measures are likely to 
become important precedents for the more ambitious arms control 
treaties to come 
the treaties are a followup to the 1963 limited test ban treaty 
which barred nuclear tests in the atmosphere underwater and in 
space 
they were intended as a first step toward slowing the race to 
develop everlarger nuclear bombs several senators said their 
approval should be the occasion to launch a new effort toward 
elimination of testing 
i urge the administration to take seriously the call for 
further steps toward a phased elimination of nuclear test blasts 
said majority leader george mitchell dmaine 
sen sam nunn dga chairman of the armed services committee 
noted that president reagan pledged to begin work on eliminating 
testing once the two treaties were ratified that was a very 
important pledge and it now comes into play nunn said 
at a hearing last week ronald f lehman ii director of the 
arms control and disarmament agency said that process will begin 
in a matter of months with a gradual lowering of the ceiling on 
test yields nunn said 
the treaties ran into delays after they were signed first 
because of the carter administrations desire to seek a 
comprehensive test ban rather than a limitation the reagan 
administration then held them up because it believed the united 
states would be unable to make sure the soviets did not cheat and 
charged that moscow had violated the ceiling on at least two dozen 
occasions 
the threshold test ban treaty puts a ceiling of 150 kilotons on 
the size of weapons tests and provides detailed procedures to 
ensure that the other side can accurately measure yields 
the peaceful nuclear explosions treaty places identical limits 
on nuclear blasts for peaceful purposes such as seismic 
exploration or excavation the united states has not detonated such 
a peaceful explosion since 1973 and the soviets ceased such 
blasts in 1988 
the pact is intended primarily to ensure that large nuclear 
weapons tests are not carried out under the guise of peaceful 
explosions 
meanwhile tuesday bush sent to capitol hill a treaty to end the 
45yearold division of germany in it the united states 
relinquishes all rights and responsibilities over germany it 
assumed after world war ii with france great britain and the 
soviet union 
at a white house ceremony the president called the agreement 
the culmination of more than four decades of western resolve and 
determination from the darkest hours of the cold war to the bright 
new horizons that stretch before us

it will take much more than an order from 
baghdad for iraq to boost wheat production significantly 
agriculture department analysts say 
the iraqi government this week ordered farmers to plant 80 
percent of their land to wheat in an attempt to offset food 
shortages caused by the international trade embargo that followed 
iraqs invasion of kuwait 
but usda analysts questioned tuesday said it will be virtually 
impossible for iraq to become selfsufficient in food grains under 
the present circumstances 
the sources who spoke only on condition of anonymity cited 
iraqs sparse rainfall limited arable land and poor prospects for 
irrigation development as limiting factors 
no political structure exists that would encourage 
agricultural development at the present time one analyst said 
the years of war with iran helped stall what progress they were 
making 
according to iraqs agriculture ministry as reported in the 
baath party newspaper althawra committees have been formed in 
all provinces to oversee the countrys wheat program 
ministry undersecretary abdul sattar hussein was reported to 
have said the extra effort was needed because of the economic 
blockade and that farmers should plant every inch of our land and 
increase the production of grains especially wheat because this is 
the basic foodstuff of our people 
iraq has a total land area of about 43 million hectares or 
about 106 million acres according to usda records a hectare is 
247 acres 
more than twothirds of iraq is desert wasteland or urban 
areas and only about 143 million acres are arable or fit to grow 
crops according to one usda analyst pasture land which depends 
greatly on seasonal rains makes up an additional 99 million 
acres and irrigation is available on about 62 million acres 
but theyve got a terrible salinity problem on a lot of their 
irrigated land the analyst said 
according to usda accounting iraqs biggest wheat crop was 26 
million metric tons harvested in 1972 a year of good weather and 
more favorable policies in baghdad 
it drifted down from there the analyst said and they 
need about 4 million tons of wheat a year for consumption 
iraqs wheat production in 199091 is projected by usda at 
800000 tons onefifth of the countrys needs 
about threefourths of iraqs food needs have been imported 
with the united states a major provider of wheat and other grain 
in the 198990 marketing year iraq was the eighthlargest us 
overseas market for wheat 
the agriculture departments economic research service said in a 
recent outlook report that the persian gulf conflict could have 
an adverse impact on us wheat exports and noted that iraq alone 
accounted for more than 1 million tons of wheat last year 
kuwait itself has been a relatively small wheat market 
importing about 150000 tons annually about 50000 tons from the 
united states the report said however kuwait recently 
exerted its influence in the world wheat market by providing credit 
to egypt

the chairman of a congressional panel 
overseeing the 1990 census says release of official state 
population figures may have to be delayed because too many people 
are going uncounted 
rep thomas sawyer dohio chairman of the house post office 
subcommittee on the census said the census bureau is rechecking 
disputed figures and has assured that several million people will 
be added to the preliminary us total population count of 
245837681 
i am increasingly concerned however that these programs are 
not designed to find the significant numbers of people who may have 
been overlooked during the primary counting phases sawyer said 
tuesday at a hearing by his subcommittee 
the lawmaker plans to introduce a bill that would delay release 
of official state population counts until the commerce secretary 
has adjusted the figures based on the rechecks or determined that 
no adjustment is necessary 
that decision must be made by july 15 1991 state population 
counts were to be released by next april 1 so that state 
governments would have plenty of time to redistrict before the 1991 
state election season 
the final count also will lead to congressional redistricting 
although timing is not quite so critical for that since the next 
congressional election is not until 1992 
testimony before sawyers committee emphasized the problems the 
census bureau is having counting this complex society with its 
ethnic diversity extensive travel habits diverse living 
arrangements and huge geographic areas 
rep john dingell dmich said for example that in monroe 
mich census workers apparently listed vacancies for houses whose 
inhabitants were simply out of town 
michigan has a long winter and many permanent residents are 
away from home during the early spring dingell said 
according to census reports 389 monroe houses and apartments 
are vacant although city officials say there are only 41 units 
without residents dingell said 
rep frank mccloskey dind said census workers missed 7000 
students in dormitories on the bloomington campus of indiana 
university 
he said bloomington mayor tomi allison also told him that about 
900 housing units in the city are missing from preliminary census 
figures 
rep arthur ravenel jr rsc who represents charleston 
county said hurricane hugo caused many of his constituents to be 
displaced and uncounted 
prior to the hurricane the city of charleston had an 
estimated vacancy rate of 7 percent said ravenel in april of 
1990 after the storm it was reported to be 116 percent 
according to the census he said 
rep mike espy dmiss whose district is the third poorest in 
the country said the census bureau didnt seem to understand the 
complications of counting a predominantly poor minority rural 
district where many citizens lack the basic education needed to 
fill out forms 
barbara everitt bryant director of the census bureau said the 
postcensus review was finding clusters of missed housing units and 
group quarters such as dormitories 
she said 39000 local governments have had a chance to review 
preliminary counts and identify discrepancies that will be 
rechecked 
we have heard some people claim the census was a disaster 
bryant said making such statements is at best premature and at 
worst misleading and potentially mischievous

sponsors of a bill that would require sharp 
increases in automobile fuel economy say they will try again next 
year to get the measure passed after hitting a roadblock in the 
senate 
the senate refused tuesday to limit debate on the bill which 
would have required the automakers to attain a fleet fuel economy 
average of 40 miles per gallon by the year 2001 the measure then 
was withdrawn from consideration 
the vote was 5742 in favor of invoking cloture or limiting 
debate but 60 votes were required 
the minority of senators won a small and shortsighted 
victory sen richard bryan dnev said after the vote we 
will be back next year 
the auto industry had vigorously fought the legislation 
claiming it would force them to build only small cars and lead to 
the demise of the sixpassenger family sedan 
environmentalists and the bills sponsors disputed the claim and 
argued that industry would develop technologies to increase gas 
mileage and still provide a broad range of car sizes 
bryan said he was heartened by the fact that a majority of the 
senators voted to advance the bill although not enough to cut off 
debate 
the senate action came as the environmental protection agency 
released its fuel economy statistics for 1991 model cars the list 
showed that automakers have made virtually no overall fuel 
efficiency gains over the last five years the average fuel economy 
for all cars was 281 mpg the same as in 1987 more than half of 
the cars get less than 23 mpg the epa said 
the auto industry had waged a vigorous campaign against bryans 
legislation which would require manufacturers to produce cars with 
a companywide average fuel economy of 35 mpg by 1995 and 40 mpg by 
the year 2001 the industry argued that such advances would be 
impossible to achieve without making cars dramatically smaller 
bryan had said earlier he was optimistic about the chances of 
the bills passage in light of the increased awareness about the 
need to reduce the countrys dependence on foreign oil he 
contended that his legislation eventually would save 28 million 
barrels of oil a day 
environmentalists also had lauded the bill as the best way to 
conserve energy and reduce demands for mideast oil 
today the gas guzzlers won and theyre popping the champagne 
corks in iraqi leader saddam husseins palace said daniel 
becker a lobbyist for the sierra club 
opponents led by sen donald riegle dmich maintained that 
the tougher fuel economy standards could not be achieved unless 
manufacturers stopped making a full line of familysize cars 
riegle argued during debate that bryans legislation would have 
imposed an unfair 625 billion cost on automakers over five years 
as they shiftedto complying with more stringent fuel economy 
requirements

the chairmen of the house and senate banking 
committees agree on key elements of a sweeping plan to revamp the 
deposit insurance system improving the chances for passage of 
major banking legislation next year 
sen donald w riegle jr dmich chairman of the senate 
banking committee on tuesday introduced legislation that would 
force regulators to abandon their toobigtofail policy of 
protecting all deposits regardless of amount at large banks 
his bill would impose losses on depositors with more than 
100000 in a failed bank or savings and loan institution 
currently the federal deposit insurance corp has an unstated 
policy of protecting all depositors in large institutions whose 
failure they fear would ripple through the financial system the 
drawback is that this encourages depositors to put their money in 
unsound institutions paying high interest rates 
under riegles bill depositors would still be allowed to insure 
all of their money by splitting it among several institutions but 
currently permitted ways of insuring more than 100000 at a single 
institution through trust and joint accounts would be banned 
riegles bill also would force regulators to restrict the 
risktaking of ailing banks and sampls before they become insolvent 
rep henry b gonzalez dtexas chairman of the house banking 
committee has proposed similar legislation he called riegles 
bill right on target 
at a meeting of his committee tuesday gonzalez released a study 
by his staff showing the fdic protected 995 percent of deposits in 
all bank failures during the past five years even though on 
average only 75 percent are insured 
in sampl failures between august 1989 and june 1990 9997 percent 
of all deposits were protected at an excess cost of 78 billion 
the study found 
the agreement of the two chairmen on the fundamental issue could 
pave the way for major banking legislation next year that extends 
far beyond deposit insurance 
curbing the insurance would give lawmakers the leeway to 
restructure the financial system permitting banks to enter the 
riskier but potentially more lucrative businesses of insurance and 
securities underwriting 
however some members of the house committee and fdic chairman 
l william seidman warned that it will not be a easy to get rid of 
the toobigtofail policy 
rep charles schumer dny said big depositors would shift 
their money to foreign banks whose governments one way or another 
protect their large banks from failing 
seidman said riegles bill as written would simply push the 
job of protecting big banks from collapse from the fdic to the 
federal reserve which supplies temporary advances to institutions 
experiencing runs by depositors 
if it were revised to effectively force all regulators to 
abandon toobigtofail it could be dangerous he warned 
that could be a very destabilizing factor in our financial 
system seidman said 
to permit modernization of the financial system without added 
risk to taxpayers through deposit insurance seidman advocated 
letting banks expand into new areas through separately capitalized 
subsidiaries that would not use deposits 
he suggested that some riskier activities already permitted to 
banks also should be shifted into subsidiaries among these are 
loans to foreign countries corporate takeover and leveraged buyout 
lending foreign exchange trading longterm commercial loans and 
loans for land purchases

a major civil rights bill designed to spur 
minority hiring is out of a housesenate conference committee but 
under threat of a presidential veto on grounds it would lead to 
quotas 
we are optimistic that the president will approve the action 
of the congress rep augustus hawkins dcalif said tuesday 
after lawmakers reached a compromise between slightly differing 
house and senate versions 
but other lawmakers indicated it was far from certain that 
president bush would sign such a measure the president has a 
historic choice to make said sen edward m kennedy dmass 
five supreme court decisions last year would be effectively 
negated by the bill which is the top item on the civil rights 
movements legislative agenda this year 
the bills features range from a ban on racial harassment in the 
workplace to measures aimed at locking in courtapproved 
fairhiring plans 
the main dispute has been over provisions designed to make it 
easier for minorities to win job discrimination suits 
administration officials contend that these provisions are so 
skewed against employers that companies would seek employment 
practices that would automatically provide them with an airtight 
defense in the event of a suit 
and that would mean hiring quotas say the administration and 
business groups that oppose the legislation 
civil rights forces scoff at that notion saying the bill would 
basically restore the law to what it was before last years supreme 
court decision in a case involving an alaskan salmon cannery 
the bill passed by the house was for the most part adopted by 
the conference committee as well the only major departure was a 
provision placing a cap on punitive damages that could be awarded 
in civil rights suits 
the cap would be either 150000 or the total of compensatory 
damages plus any lost pay whichever was larger 
the house had approved a cap of either 500000 or the total of 
compensatory damages whichever was larger there was no cap in the 
senate bill 
under the house version the cap would have applied only to 
employers with 100 or fewer workers larger companies would have 
been vulnerable to unlimited punitive damages the conference 
committee placed all companies under the cap 
the vote on the cap provision was 97 with republicans voting 
against the measure

sleep disorders affect millions of americans 
often causing accidents and ruining careers but they usually are 
ignored by physicians and victims may go years without treatment 
in a hearing on capitol hill of the national commission on sleep 
disorders research victims and experts said tuesday that more 
attention must be paid to the suite of sleep ailments that can 
cripple lives end marriages disrupt careers and even cause death 
the need for sleep research is virtually ignored said 
william c dement chairman of the commission and a medical 
professor at stanford university the house of research does not 
have a bedroom 
sleep disorders range from an irresistible urge to sleep an 
ailment called narcolepsy to insomnia which is the inability to 
achieve adequate or restful sleep other problems include 
restless leg syndrome the jerking and twitching of the lower 
limbs during sleep snoring which may be habitual for almost half 
of all adults and sleep apnea a disorder in which breathing stops 
and restarts through the night disturbing rest and perhaps causing 
death in some victims 
people also suffer from sleep disorders caused by travel and 
work schedules that disturb the natural restwake cycle sleep 
cycle changes may pose a particular hazard in modern society the 
experts said 
david dinges a university of pennsylvania psychologist said 
that poor sleep and the resulting lack of alertness is becoming a 
major element in industrial accidents particularly for shift 
workers jet travelers who cross many time zones and those working 
too many hours 
inadequate sleep is a major cause of human error and at least 
as important as drugs alcohol and equipment failure in workplace 
accidents he said 
dinges said airplanes ships factories and power plants all are 
becoming increasingly automated which means humans must sit and 
alertly monitor what the machines are doing 
thats a task we do poorly after missing some sleep 
especially if we have to work at night he said 
dinges said industry and the military are beginning to recognize 
the need to shift work hours to allow for the human need to adjust 
sleep cycles to new schedules 
he said that the use of bright lights to readjust sleep cycles 
shows promise allowing pilots to nap in the cockpit has been 
shown useful in keeping them alert during long transoceanic 
flights he said but other proposed treatments such as special 
diets have proven useless in treating the fatigue of jet lag and 
night shift work 
sufferers of narcolepsy testified that they must constantly 
fight the tendency to suddenly drop off to sleep often at the very 
worst of times 
lori highland of ashford wash said she has spent her life 
in a haze of sleepiness 
my life is haunted by this she said i cant drive i 
have been hospitalized repeatedly for injuries that occur when 
she collapses suddenly into sleep 
mrs highland said that powerful emotions such as anger 
laughter or fear will bring on cataplexy a sudden muscle weakness 
that causes a victim to collapse and be unable to move 
she said that her grandfather had similar symptoms as did her 
mother and now her young daughter 
this has affected four generations said mrs highland my 
mother was labeled a neer do well because she couldnt stay 
awake long enough to do her housework 
she said doctors could not identify her problem for years and 
that she tried many different treatments all unsuccessful mrs 
highland said she was being prepared for surgery to search for 
what was thought to be a brain tumor when a doctor who had taken a 
recent seminar on sleep disorders diagnosed her disorder 
allen music of silver spring md said he suffers from sleep 
apnea which destroys normal sleep and keeps him in a state of 
uncontrolled drowsiness 
before his illness was diagnosed music said he routinely drove 
a car and often would awaken to find the vehicle wrecked because he 
had fallen asleep at the wheel to make even a short trip music 
said he learned that he had to take a nap before he left stop en 
route and nap and then nap when he arrived 
gerald schefey a former methodist minister now in his 50s said 
he had to retire on disability because sleep apnea pushed him to 
the point that he was falling asleep while counseling parishioners 
or while driving 
apnea is not considered a disabling disorder but it is he 
said 
dement and other experts said the causes of narcolepsy are not 
known and there is virtually no treatment for the ailment few 
patients respond to drugs they said 
sleep apnea is now treated with surgery which works about half 
the time and with a sleep mask that feeds oxygen at a pressure 
that keeps airways from sagging closed said dr philip smith of 
johns hopkins university in baltimore

states since the epidemic began more than half those children have

iraqi president saddam hussein is trying to 
turn americans against president bush saying he is leading the 
world to the edge of a bottomless abyss 
bush wants to bring back the sorrows of america and humanity 
by repeating the vietnam experience only this time in a more 
radical manner and more violent and more casualties saddam said 
in an address to americans 
saddam taped the 75minute message in baghdad last week and it 
was delivered in washington on tuesday excerpts were aired on the 
major networks and cnn decided to show the entire message early 
today 
bush ladies and gentlemen pushes your children to a war 
which has no human value whatsoever it has no significance except 
fatal arrogance which says to those who are weak obey and 
they obey saddam said 
wearing a dark suit rather than the military uniform he often 
favors saddam warned that if bush were to launch war against iraq 
it would not be up to him to end it 
saddam taped his address in response to an eightminute message 
by bush that was broadcast unedited on staterun iraqi television 
10 days ago bush too warned iraqis that their president had 
brought them to the brink of war 
sitting at his desk with an iraqi flag at his side saddam said 
he wanted americans to know the truth about iraqs aug 2 invasion 
and occupation of kuwait 
his rambling speech was peppered with frequent references to 
allah and his teachings and accused bush of lacking faith in god 
saddam described bush as promoting a form of neonazism by 
viewing himself as leader of the free world 
he made frequent reference to israels occupation of arab lands 
and its presence in alquds or jerusalem one of islams 
holiest sites 
saddam spoke in arabic his remarks were translated with english 
subtitles supplied by iraqi authorities 
bush is placing you in a critically embarrassing situation 
on the edge of a bottomless abyss by defending undemocratic 
governments like those of kuwait saddam said 
although bush told the iraqi people his administration had no 
quarrel with them saddam said we have evidence that president 
bush was himself involved in the irangate or irancontra 
conspiracy against iraq in 1986 when he was reagans vice 
president 
as vice president bush was privy to the reagan administrations 
decision to sell weapons to iran which was at war with iraq in 
an effort to win freedom for american hostages held by proiranian 
radicals in lebanon 
congress too was involved in a conspiracy against iraq long 
before the aug 2 invasion saddam said lawmakers wanted to impose 
economic sanctions against his country under the influence of the 
powerful zionist lobby of israels supporters he said 
he challenged bush again to an international television 
debate adding if bush has truth on his side why should he 
evade debate 
iraq desires peace but one that is based on a broad resolution 
of all the regions problems saddam said he repeated his call for 
a peace conference to resolve israels 23year occupation of arab 
lands syrias 14year occupation of lebanon and iraqs claims to 
kuwait 
kuwait he said was part of iraq under the ottoman empire until 
the british took control of the country in 1899 he called for 
the return of kuwait to the fold of iraq its motherland from 
which it was long severed and usurped like an infant separated 
from its mother 
he repeatedly attacked the credibility and integrity of the 
alsabah family which ruled kuwait for nearly 250 years until the 
invasion 
kuwaits leaders were busy amassing wealth and women he 
said so profligate were the rulers that a kuwaiti prince once 
wanted to marry a young woman only to find out she was his 
daughter saddam said

democratic leaders are trying to revive a 
major crime bill that conservatives derailed in a protest over 
death penalty provisions they said are too weak 
this is a travesty rep f james sensenbrenner rwis 
said tuesday as he and other conservatives fought the measure on 
the house floor they said it needed stricter provisions to end 
excessive delays in carrying out death sentences 
the conservatives who usually lack enough support to win such 
fights in democraticcontrolled house managed to defeat 258166 
a rule that would have barred the house from considering a tighter 
version of the death penalty provision 
the vote forced democratic leaders to pull the bill from the 
floor after only brief debate and search for a new procedure that 
would withstand any such attack 
it was a bad day on the anticrime issue for house speaker 
thomas foley dwash he also came under fire from police lobbying 
groups over a separate provision barring consideration of an 
amendment to increase controls on handguns 
the overall anticrime package calls for the death penalty for 
10 federal crimes ranging from assassination of the president to 
espionage it would allow courts to consider evidence gathered with 
flawed search warrants if police had acted in good faith 
a major controversy is brewing over habeas corpus provisions 
designed to end delays of a decade or more in carrying out 
executions while the condemned file repeated appeals claiming they 
were treated in an unconstitutional manner 
the bill is designed to limit death row inmates to one such 
petition in many cases to be filed no later than one year after 
their other appeals are exhausted the bush administration and 
conservatives led by rep henry j hyde rill say however that 
it needs to be far stronger 
as it stands the bill would reduce the degree of finality of 
convictions by weakening procedures relating to habeas corpus 
the administration said in a statement tuesday 
the administration also called for approval of warrantless 
searches if police acted in good faith and it attacked a provision 
of the house bill that would enable convicts to use racial 
statistics as a basis for appealing death sentences 
defenders of the bill said it could be improved but that it did 
provide not only powerful weapons for police in the war against 
crime but ones that could win approval on capitol hill 
it puts more arrows in the quiver of law enforcement said 
rep romano mazzoli dky but there were many democratic 
defectors 
meanwhile police groups said at a news conference that controls 
on semiautomatic assault weapons and handguns are needed if police 
are to be effective in fighting crime 
should we wait until the blood of law enforcement officers and 
peaceful citizens is running in the halls of congress before we 
pass sensible gun legislation asked fraternal order of police 
leader dewey stokes 
the police groups criticized a rules committee decision monday 
barring consideration of an amendment that would require a 
sevenday waiting period for handgun purchases 
right now speaker foley is not permitting the amendment to 
come to a vote on the floor of the house so who else can we 
blame stokes said 
foleys spokesman jeff biggs noted the house judiciary 
committee had approved the anticrime package and the handgun bill 
as separate measures and said the speaker often goes along with the 
wishes of committee chairmen he also said that foley had not ruled 
out consideration of the gun bill as a separate item

an agriculture department official rejected a 
call by the national academy of sciences for an overhaul of the 
nations critically important agricultural seed collection system 
the academy found that nearly half the seed samples in the 
nations principal collection are in danger and that only a new 
centralized administration can correct the deficiencies that led to 
that 
we think the system has worked very very well countered 
edward knipling deputy administrator of the usdas agricultural 
research service 
he said tuesday he didnt think stronger centralized management 
of the nations scattered seed banks and seed laboratories was 
possible 
the genes contained in the 232210 samples in the national seed 
storage laboratory in fort collins colo the nations largest 
collection have been used to develop new varieties of corn wheat 
and other important crops 
those new varieties have contributed to the tripling of corn 
yields and other huge gains in american agricultural productivity 
in recent decades the study said 
those gains have in turn boosted the nations economy cash 
receipts from us crops were 726 billion in 1988 up 107 
billion from the year before the study said 
managing genetic resources therefore is a strategic 
necessity for the united states the academy study said 
but the study found that 45 percent of the seed samples in the 
national seed storage laboratory contained fewer than 550 seeds 
that means they are in danger of vanishing as the seeds age and 
die 
such samples may contain irreplaceable genetic traits but the 
laboratory does not have the resources to regenerate those samples 
or increase their size by growing them to produce more seeds the 
study said 
regeneration of these samples is urgently needed the study 
said 
many of the studys conclusions echo the findings of a series 
last year by the associated press that concluded that thousands of 
irreplaceable crop seeds are dead or dying in an antiquated 
underfunded federal seed bank 
peter day of rutgers university in new jersey chairman of the 
academy committee that conducted the study said that henry l 
shands who heads the national plant germplasm system is 
extremely capable but appears to have little or no authority 
he has to depend on the agreement of large numbers of other 
committees in order to get anything done day said its a very 
difficult situation 
shands of the agricultural research service in beltsville md 
was traveling tuesday and could not be reached for comment 
genetic materials used in breeding are referred to as 
germplasm 
the national seed storage laboratory is the cornerstone of a 
network of perhaps 20 seed collections and laboratories around the 
country without a central administration the report said 
the great strategic importance of plant genetic resources 
requires that the system be administered centrally at the national 
level the study said 
the study said it will be very difficult if not impossible 
for the system to function properly without a major overhaul in its 
structure and administrative procedures 
other recommendations in the study included the appropriation of 
more money to regenerate seeds and the expansion of the national 
seed storage laboratory

gay and arab they are two words rarely spoken 
in the same breath and almost never in the conservative middle 
east but ramzi zakharia hopes to change that 
a year ago zakharia founded the gay and lesbian arabic society 
and discovered other arabamericans in the homosexual community who 
wanted to define a distinct gay arabic identity 
the result was very positive a lot of people wrote well 
its about time zakharia says 
zakharia rented a post office box started a newsletter and 
began to hold monthly meetings at peoples houses around 
washington today there are chapters in san francisco detroit 
los angeles and new york as well as a scattering of contacts in 
middle eastern countries including lebanon morocco egypt and 
yemen 
zakharia estimates total membership at about 400 and says gay 
arabs in london and paris are talking about organizing chapters as 
well 
the groups are both social and political in focus with an eye 
toward changing the ingrained middle eastern attitude that 
homosexuality is a western problem as well as western 
prejudices against arabs zakharia said in a recent interview 
there are so many negative stereotypes of arabs even in the 
gay community he said ever since we started the association 
we have gotten the most bizarre and sometimes hilarious letters 
some people have written looking for young dark men in white 
turbans ready to offer 1001night orgies he said others think 
all arabs are oilrich sheiks who throw lavish parties 
zakharia dressed in blue jeans and a tshirt belies either 
stereotype he is 26 a computer worker at the world wildlife fund 
recent events in the middle east have galvanized arabamericans 
zakharia said and gay arabamericans have been no exception the 
intifada uprising in the occupied west bank and iraqs invasion of 
kuwait have overshadowed some of the other interests of the gay and 
lesbian arabic society he said 
the palestine issue unites everyone he said about 90 
percent of arabamerican activism has centered around the palestine 
question 
zakharia a palestinian who grew up in lebanon came to the 
united states in 1982 to attend college he first tried school in 
west virginia but that was a little too rural for me he said 
so he transferred to east tennessee state university where he 
studied broadcasting after graduating he moved to washington and 
became active in arabamerican political causes only later did he 
come out as a gay man he said 
there isnt really any coming out in the middle east 
because there isnt a lifestyle per se here theres a lot of 
lifestyle and organizations to handle our needs zakharia said 
in arabic countries he said men meet each other at certain 
restaurants or cafes but there is nothing overtly gay 
nevertheless meeting men for sexual encounters is very 
available he said you can sleep with men but you cant fall 
in love with them falling in love with them is the bad part 
the glas newsletters voice a common theme of creating and 
promoting an arabic gay identity distinct from the american gay 
identity 
thats an issue that comes up a lot people asking why do 
you sound and why do you seem so americanized zakharia said 
well thats the only example we have 
one gay arab who has been corresponding with the society from 
beirut complained that the group was too free and open you have 
to keep in mind that if you want to have middle eastern members 
secrecy must be no 1 on your agenda 
the man who begged that his identity be shielded said he would 
continue to contribute to the newsletter and declared himself a 
militant supporter of your movement and a passionate one but he 
added 
as for establishing a chapter here that is out of the 
question i dont even know gay people here in beirut you see im 
a student here and i keep a low profile my gay friends are militia 
men who are uneducated and wouldnt care less for a gay movement

the senate voted to nullify administration 
rules that prohibit federally supported familyplanning clinics 
from offering abortion counseling or information 
by a vote of 6335 tuesday night the senate approved an 
amendment requiring the clinics to provide information and 
counseling concerning all legal and medical options to pregnant 
women who ask for it including pregnancy termination 
the department of health and human services issued the 
nocounseling rules in 1988 during the reagan administration and 
the bush administration continued them they have been debated by 
the opposing sides of the abortion issue and legal challenges are 
pending before the supreme court 
the clinics many of which are operated by planned parenthood 
federation of america receive federal money to provide health care 
and family planning services for the poor 
the amendment was added to a senate bill that extends the life 
of the family planning program established 20 years ago by title x 
of the public health service act 
the clinics would still be prohibited from using federal money 
to perform abortions 
the senate rejected 5834 an administration proposal to scrap 
the program and replace it with block grants to the states a move 
that would have handed the issue to each of the states 
other amendments to the bill were pending 
opponents of abortion opposed the amendment reversing the 
administrations regulation arguing that the federal government 
should not encourage abortions or make them more available 
most americans do not want their tax dollars used in any way 
to facilitate abortions said sen orrin hatch rutah 
advocates of abortion rights argued that the regulatory ban 
discriminated against poor women preventing them from having the 
same information that women who could afford their own doctor would 
receive they said the clinics would not encourage abortions 
whether its abstinence adoption or abortion i believe young 
people have a right to know said sen barbara mikulski dmd 
since enactment in 1970 title x has prohibited aid from going 
to programs where abortion is a method of family planning 
until 1988 that was interpreted as barring the use of federal funds 
to pay for abortions that year hhs adopted a broader 
interpretation that federal money couldnt go to family planning 
programs that provide abortion counseling and referral 
the action touched off a series of lawsuits and federal appeals 
courts have delivered conflicting rulings one of the cases is 
scheduled for argument before the supreme court in its october 
term 
why not let the court make this decision because its 
probably going to have to in the end anyway hatch said

the man who raised nearly 4 million for francis 
bellottis democratic gubernatorial bid is jumping to the campaign 
of gop nominee william weld 
peter berlandi said he would bring more fundraising muscle to 
weld following a primary that was declared by a state agency 
tuesday to be the most expensive in state history the five 
candidates spent 124 million starting on jan 1 1989 
berlandi who described himself as a strong believer in the 
democratic party said he was taking the move because weld and 
bellotti possess the same qualities of courage creativity and 
integrity 
i am not here to change my party affiliation he said 
but the move reflected a further shift in political lines in the 
governors race on monday former democratic gov edward j king 
who switched to the republican party said he would support 
democratic nominee john silber king now lives in florida 
weld who has taken progressive stances on several social 
issues said he expected more democrats would come to his side 
berlandi said he does not share welds support for the citizens 
for limited taxation petition that would roll back taxes and fees 
but he said weld could do a better job managing the states 
finances than silber who is on leave as president of boston 
university

the predominantly black african methodist 
episcopal zion church endorsed gov carroll campbells reelection 
bid 
the churchs announcement meant that for the second time in a 
week a black organization has spurned democratic gubernatorial 
candidate theo mitchell who is black in favor of campbell a 
white republican 
last week the south carolina conference of black mayors 
endorsed campbell 
bishop richard l fisher of the amezions palmetto conference 
said tuesday that campbell is one of the brightest stars in the 
political horizon 
fisher said the endorsement should not be interpreted as a 
rejection of mitchell its a bit of pragmatism on our part and 
a bit of cynicism i dont believe the democratic party in this 
state is ready to support a black governor fisher said 
the bishop also said that while he and campbell have had 
frequent contact in the past few years weve not heard from 
senator mitchell i dont know anything about the mitchell 
campaign 
asked what party he belonged to fisher said im a 
republican i guess 
blacks should not feel that just because mitchell is black they 
should have to vote for him fisher said the black community is 
growing up fisher said

for years the world bank group has been the 
major source of loans and expertise to stimulate economic 
development in poor mostly tropical countries of asia africa and

now the bank and the related international monetary fund find 
themselves at the center of the action in a cooler part of the 
world nations of the former soviet bloc in central and eastern 
europe 
we are bringing to europe what we have been doing in africa 
the caribbean and so forth said douglas gustafson director of 
investments for europe and the middle east of the groups private 
sector branch the international finance corp 
currently the spotlight is on privatization of largescale 
government enterprise something gustavson described as totally 
uncharted territory 
dramatizing the changes czechoslovakia one of the 22 founding

prague seeks credits to support drastic price and currency 
reforms planned for the end of 1990 and technical assistance for 
plans to privatize about 70 percent of its statecontrolled 
industry it will use such techniques as distribution of shares to 
the public and perhaps an ifcdesigned mutual fund 
depending on the strength and quality of its reforms newly 
democratic czechoslovakia could draw 300 million to 500 million a

director eugenio f lari 
the world bank anticipates lending poland about 800 million a 
year hungary about 400 million and yugoslavia 600 million to 
700 million lari told reporters 
hungary in the forefront of economic reform has been allocated

preparation for the soviet unions expected accession to the bank 
group 
the supreme soviet in moscow voted monday to abandon 70 years of 
communist economics and move toward a market economy in what some 
delegates at the annual meetings termed a second russian 
revolution 
treasury secretary nicholas brady told fellow bank governors 
monday that the international lending agencies must adjust their 
operations to emphasize development of the private sector rather 
than strengthening of government enterprises 
but gustavson said the actual privatization process would 
require experimentation we do not have a cookbook solution to 
reversing the balance from 90 percent state ownership and 10 
percent private to 1090 he said 
nations until recently under communist rule want to privatize 
but theres an underlying sensitivity about the disquieting 
prospect of selling out cheaply to foreign investors said 
gustavson an american who has worked in africa for the governments 
of sierra leone and nigeria 
when the hungarians started spontaneous privatization there 
were indeed some very sweetheart concessional deals done he 
continued the hungarians observed it and put the brakes on 
slowing the process 
gustavson said history may show the best solution to be 
czechoslovakias plan to distribute shares of stateowned property 
to its own citizens in the form of free or lowcost vouchers not 
transferable to foreigners until a later stage of reform

a federal judge struck down campaign 
contribution limits that california voters approved in 1988 a 
state election official warned against a fundraising frenzy 
before the nov 6 election 
a spokesman for the republican gubernatorial candidate us 
sen pete wilson challenged democratic candidate dianne feinstein 
the former san francisco mayor to join him in voluntarily adhering 
to the old limits 
but the wilson spokesman bill livingstone wouldnt commit the 
candidate to the voluntary limit a feinstein spokeswoman dee dee 
myers said the ruling may give feinstein a chance to chip away at 
wilsons fundraising lead 
if a law is overturned i dont know that we will feel 
compelled to abide by it she said 
us district judge lawrence karlton ruled tuesday that the 
limits unfairly help incumbents the limits affect campaigns for 
governor other statewide offices and some local posts 
two state legislators who cosponsored the limits said they 
would appeal the decision the state fair political practices 
commission a political watchdog agency said it would ask karlton 
to stay his ruling 
commission chairman john larson warned candidates not to start a 
fundraising frenzy 
karltons ruling invalidated proposition 73 which among other 
things limits individuals to a maximum of 1000 in contributions 
to a particular candidate per fiscal year the measure also limits 
political action committees donations to 2500 or 5000 per 
candidate per fiscal year depending on the size of the committee 
the limits are based on fiscal years that start on july 1 since 
state campaigns typically span two calendar years the measure 
creates three contribution periods an individual can give a 
candidate 3000 over two calendar years 
the judge said that helps incumbents because they usually start 
fundraising earlier than challengers do 
two of proposition 73s three authors assembly republican 
leader ross johnson and independent state sen quentin kopp said 
they would ask the 9th us circuit court of appeals to overturn 
karltons ruling 
the timing of this decision is most unfortunate johnson 
said 
former gov jerry brown chairman of the state democratic party 
one of the plaintiffs in the case said the decision strikes down 
one of the most pernicious campaign laws ever enacted and puts an 
end to the pervasive state censorship of grassroots activism 
imposed by proposition 73 
wilson had nearly 4 million at the start of the general 
election campaign in july feinstein had 645000 spokesmen for 
both candidates said they didnt know how much had been raised 
since july

saudi arabias ambassador to the united 
states in a bluntly worded open letter to king hussein of jordan 
takes his fellow arab to task for siding with iraq in the current 
mideast standoff 
the ambassador bandar bin sultan alsaud also chided hussein 
for failing to protect moslem holy places and doing little to 
advance the cause of palestinian statehood 
the ambassadors letter was published on the oped pages of the 
washington post and the new york times in wednesday editions 
relations between saudi arabia and jordan have soured because of 
husseins attempts to keep good relations with iraq and his 
criticisms of the deployment of us troops to saudi arabia 
following iraqs takeover of kuwait last month 
last saturday saudi arabia expelled 20 jordanian diplomats 
reportedly fo gathering information on strategic saudi 
installations for iraq 
referring to a televised speech of the king to the american 
public last week prince bandar asked wouldnt it be more 
honorable and truly moving if you had been moved enough by kuwaiti 
women and children with tears in their eyes because they lost their 
country as a result of the aggression of your friend saddam 
hussein 
he asked the jordanian king who has criticized the presence of 
nonmoslem troops in saudi arabia home to islams holiest shrines 
what you have done to safeguard the alaqsa mosque and the church 
of the holy sepulchre that you lost to the israelis in 1967 
the prince noted that hussein has defended the palestinian 
peoples right to selfdetermination but said that jordan did not 
give statehood to palestinians in the west bank now under israeli 
occupation when jordan controlled the area from 1948 to 1967 
and how would the occupation of kuwait give our brother 
palestinians their homeland 
bandar also attacked iraqs argument repeated by jordan that 
the kuwaitiraqi border is disputed because it was drawn up by 
colonial britain your majesty you should be the last one to say 
that not only all your borders but your whole country was created 
by the same colonial british 
the ambassador contradicted husseins statements that the 
situation resembled europe of 1914 drifting into a world war 
your majesty the situation today is like the 1930s when a 
madman decided to annex his neighbor and the world did nothing 
which led to world war ii a reference to hitlers takeovers of 
czechoslovakia and austria 
the saudi leader closed the letter on a strikingly personal 
tone 
your majesty i long had great respect and affection for you 
to have deep respect and affection for your people but i no longer 
can feel that you are the same man i knew i hope that i am wrong 
and if i am wrong please accept my sincere apologies your 
majesty but facts are stubborn things

after being pulled over by legislators 
gov george sinner has donated his radar detector to a charity 
auction today 
it grieves me greatly to part with this priceless family 
heirloom but im willing to make this sacrifice in the interest of 
promoting mental tranquility for bryce streibel and pete naaden 
he said 
the two republican state senators frequent critics of the 
democratic governor noticed the detector on the dashboard of 
sinners truck when they visited the capitol two weeks ago 
sinner appoints the chief of the highway patrol and during the 
labor day weekend had called on truckers to alert police to 
speeders 
the governor at first shrugged off the matter calling the 
detector sort of a sacred emotional thing that had sentimental 
value as a gift from his children but on tuesday he had a change 
of heart 
the north dakota mental health association was to sell the radar 
detector at its annual auction

the american medical association wants the 
federal health departments inspector general fired claiming the 
former fbi agent has been reckless and unfair in pursuing medicare 
and medicaid fraud 
the ama in a letter to president bush argued that richard 
kusserow has discredited the administration in carrying out his 
oversight duties at the department of health and human services 
kusserow was out of town tuesday and could not be reached for 
comment his spokeswoman judy holtz said the office was surprised 
by the amas action she said she could not comment except to say 
the inspector generals record speaks for itself 
rep fortney pete stark dcalif chairman of the house 
ways and means subcommittee on health quickly came to kusserows 
defense putting out a statement shortly after the ama released its 
letter to reporters 
criticism from the ama is a red badge of courage to mr 
kusserow said stark who often is criticized by the organization 
himself anyone who resists giving the ama completely free access 
to the treasury and the taxpayers wallet is immediately branded by 
the ama as antidoctor dick kusserow should get a medal for saving 
the taxpayer fortunes that he is being criticized today is a sure 
sign he is doing his job 
dr robert mcafee vice chairman of the ama board of trustees 
said frustration over kusserows actions has built up over the last 
five years to the point that physicians dont trust him any 
more

harsher penalties should be levied against 
employers who discriminate against foreignlooking workers to avoid 
hiring illegal aliens according to an administration task force 
the 1986 immigration reform and control act was not intended 
to be a barrier for persons who are eligible to work but the 
evidence shows that many employers are discriminating by adopting 
exclusionary hiring practices the task force said tuesday in its 
report to congress 
those practices include hiring only applicants who prove they 
were born on us soil and rejecting legal immigrants who present 
workauthorization documents issued by the immigration and 
naturalization service the study said 
the task force said fines for discriminating against 
foreignlooking workers should be commensurate with the penalties 
for employers who knowingly hire illegal aliens that would 
increase the maximum fine for repeated discrimination from 2000 
to 10000 it said 
the task force also recommended streamlining the procedures for 
employers to check documents that applicants present to prove 
citizenship or legal status

tokyo stock exchanges key index fell more than 
1000 points wednesday to end at a 32month low the dollar closed 
higher against the japanese yen 
the 225share nikkei stock average lost 1108 points or 475 
percent ending the day at 2225062 the lowest closing level 
since jan 5 1988 on that day the nikkei closed at 2157528 
the index which shed 41851 points on tuesday rose about 150 
points in early trading before falling back 
the dollar closed at 13740 yen up 070 yen from tuesdays 
close it opened at 13657 yen and ranged between 13645 yen and 
13740 
share prices rose early wednesday morning because stability in 
bond markets and the new york stock exchanges strength reassured 
japanese investors traders said 
the dow jones industrial average gained 3267 points to close at 
248564 
however the index slowed down its gains and reversed direction 
as investors buying interest did not last said haruhito ichimura 
a trader with nippon kangyo kakumaru securities co 
the decline was not because of massive panicselling 
but the decline below the 23000point level must be quite a shock 
to the market he said because many investors believed that 
the 23000point level would be the bottom 
in currency dealings the dollar strengthened from the opening 
as a result of the yens weakness against the european currencies 
in crosstrading dealers said 
they said continuing uncertainties in the persian gulf crisis 
are supporting the dollar despite a slowdown in the us economy 
some market players see the united nations decision to impose 
an air embargo on iraq as the last peaceful move the usled

new jersey led the nation last year in spending 
an average of 8439 per pupil while utah ranked last at less than 
onethird that amount 
new jersey now locked in a bitter struggle over school 
finances thus replaced new york as the nations perpupil spending 
leader according to the national education association ranking 
new york placed second at 8094 
utah spent 2733 per pupil according to the annual report 
its not a pleasant place to be scott bean utah deputy 
schools superintendent said in a telephone interview tuesday he 
pointed out however that the legislature enacted some 130 
million in education spending increases last year 
nationwide spending per pupil averaged 4890 in 198990 up 
from 4607 the year earlier 
average teacher salaries reached 31166 compared with 29570 
the previous year according to the teacher unions figures 
alaska with its high cost of living paid teachers the most on 
average 43153 south dakota teachers ranked last 21300 
connecticuts teachers got the biggest pay boost last year and 
now rank second average pay was 40461 in 198990 up more than 
3000 from 37343 
spending per pupil actually declined in two states north 
dakota where it fell to 3581 in 198990 from 3662 the year 
before and in montana where it dropped to 4147 from 4176 
in north dakota a voter referendum in december repealed three 
tax increases 
officials differ on whether more money necessarily means better 
schooling 
a lot of people say throwing more dollars wont help 
education well id like to try it just once said utahs bean 
will myers a school finance consultant who helped compile the 
nea statistics said perpupil spending bears a strong relationship 
to class size 
utah had the highest pupiltoteacher ratio in 198990 236 
new jerseys was 134 thirdlowest among the states for which such 
statistics were available 
other factors accounting for statetostate spending disparities 
include how homogeneous the student population is and the cost of 
living in a given state 
most of the research that deals with spending versus school 
performance indicates that family background is pretty important 
myers said tuesday when you have a heterogenous population you 
probably have a more difficult job bringing students to the same 
educational level than when you have a homogeneous population 
utah and new jersey are in sharp contrast in that respect 
he said 
the nea survey is based on statistics from state departments of 
education the data are regarded as among the most reliable of 
their kind by education researchers 
other top spenders among the 50 states included new york 
8094 per pupil connecticut 7934 the district of columbia 
7407 alaska 7252 rhode island 6523 massachusetts 
6170 maryland 5887 delaware 5848 and wisconsin 5703

sales of guns and burglary alarms have picked up 
in the nations fourthlargest city since the courts ordered the 
release of more than 270 inmates to relieve overcrowding at the 
harris county jail 
all the freed inmates had been jailed on misdemeanors but for 
some houstonarea residents thats no more reassuring than hearing 
houston trails miami new york los angeles dallas and detroit in 
crime 
at least 31 of the 276 inmates freed on personal recognizance 
bond since sept 14 are already back behind bars police said 
seven have been charged with felonies including armed robbery in 
one case police said 
were just arresting the same people were letting them out 
and arresting them again said sheriff johnny klevenhagen the 
citizens of harris county have again been victimized by the 
system 
the jail designed for 4200 inmates now has about 6300 down 
from a peak of 8800 a year ago 
the early releases were set in motion when the county missed an 
aug 31 deadline set by us district judge james deanda to reduce 
the population to 6100 
bill carter president of carters country gun shops reported a 
10 percent increase in gun sales 
theres a lot of talk in the community about the jail releases 
and weve had a lot of women come in for shooting lessons he 
said 
harris county blames the state for the overcrowding inmates in 
county jails are supposed to be sent to state prisons once they are 
convicted of state crimes but the prisons are overcrowded and slow 
to take jail inmates 
the jails overcrowding has been kicking around the courts for 
18 years with assistant attorney general robert ozer guiding the 
states case since 1987 ozer accused county officials of 
sensationalizing the releases 
what it creates for the public is a kind of panic he said 
it appears the system is breaking down when in reality some of 
these people shouldnt have been placed in these facilities to 
begin with 
similar lawsuits over inmate overcrowding also have resulted in 
the early release of prisoners in other states 
james oitzinger who represented harris county inmates in a 
lawsuit that resulted in the early releases said some of those set 
free would have been out on the street anyway in a matter of days 
to me its a great big yawn he said 
when the first batch of nearly 80 inmates poured out of the jail 
sept 14 they were confronted by a group called mothers of 
murdered children waving signs and shouting protests 
theres a lot of people scared said freda baker coowner 
of bakers indoor pistol range 
theyre worried about their safety theyre arming 
themselves to protect themselves said her husband ct baker 
who reported a jump in the number of people calling for 
instructions on how to handle firearms 
david wilt owner of detection alarms said customers who asked 
for estimates three months ago are now calling back to buy home 
security systems 
the state is aggressively building more prisons but they wont 
be open soon 
i think we all realize texas has a serious problem i dont 
think thats any news to anybody said harris county judge jon 
lindsay its probably a little more acute here in harris 
county

by the year 2000 at least 10 million children will 
likely be infected with the aids virus while another 10 million 
will be orphaned by the immunestripping disease the world health 
organization says 
most victims will be in the third world where aids will become 
a major child killer dr michael merson a who official said 
tuesday 
that would reverse progress made in improving health through 
vaccinations and other child care programs 
who forecast that hiv the human immunodeficiency virus that 
causes aids will spread to 25 to 30 million people by the year 
2000 previous projections of 15 to 20 million did not take 
children into account a who statement said 
the un agency estimates that 8 to 10 million people including 
3 million women of childbearing age may already be infected with 
the virus 
merson told a news conference that who only recently started 
compiling statistics on childhood cases because of the upsurge in 
infection among women and hence their offspring was still 
relatively new 
aids destroys the bodys immune system the hiv virus is spread 
through sexual contact shared syringes and contaminated blood it 
often is transmitted from a mother to her unborn child although 
occasionally can be spread through the mothers milk during 
breastfeeding 
merson head of whos antiaids unit said 30 percent of infants 
born to infected mothers were hivpositive and fourfifths of 
those young sufferers died before age 5 
of the remaining 70 percent many were likely to become orphans 
placing a huge strain on the scarce resources of poor countries he 
said 
he added that scientists did not know why so many children 
escaped infection from their mothers 
the who statement said that an estimated 400000 children have 
developed severe aids symptoms since the epidemic began a decade 
ago nearly 90 percent of the cases were in subsaharan africa 
the statement said that during the next 10 years the disease is 
expected to push up infant mortality rates by 50 percent in parts 
of africa 
in addition to the young victims 800000 adults are also 
thought to have contracted the disease the statement said 
merson said that in some urban areas of central and eastern 
africa the virus may have affected one in four adults 
only 283000 aids cases have been officially reported to the 
genevabased who because of widespread underreporting by its 
member countries

the following are excerpts from saddam 
husseins 75minute speech to the american people the english 
translation comes from subtitles and voiceovers supplied by iraqi 
authorities 
 
on president bushs policies toward the iraqi people 
 
bush has said to the people of iraq that the american 
administration had no quarrel with them to prove that he said 
that the administration had allowed the iraqis to purchase some of 
the goods they needed particularly grains on the us market he 
also said that the us administration had also helped to bring 
about the ceasefire in the iraqiran war 
the us president was not accurate in saying that the us 
administration had no quarrel with the people of iraq we have 
evidence that president bush was himself involved in the irangate 
or irancontra conspiracy against iraq in 1986 when he was reagans 
vice president 
voices had already begun to be raised in the us and britain 
for an economic technological and scientific boycott to be imposed 
on iraq well before the emergence of the current gulf crisis some 
of the boycott measures against iraq including the embargo on the 
export of grains and other commodities to iraq had already been 
discussed and adopted by the us and some western countries before 
august 2 1990 the day on which the iraqi army extended assistance 
in throwing out the former rulers of kuwait who had been installed 
by the former rulers of kuwait who had been installed by foreign 
powers to impose a despotic rule on this severed part of iraq 
 
on the trade embargo against iraq and the united nations 
failure to impose embargoes on israel or syria after it moved 
troops into lebanon 
 
such measures were never taken against israel when it announced 
its annexation of arab lands and cities in an official and final 
manner 
no us armies have ever been deployed against that regime nor 
have we seen an embargo or boycott being imposed against the syrian 
regime yet we see how the armies of the us have been 
deployed against iraq and how the valiant iraqi people have been 
denied food medicine and even their childrens milk 
this has been imposed through a decision taken exclusively by 
the us contrary to bushs claim that those measures were taken 
by international organizations these international organizations 
came indeed later only to be used as a cover for measures already 
drawn up 
 
on us and british leadership in opposing iraq 
 
these measures taken by the us and britain including their 
military buildup in the region along with the imposition of the 
economic embargo and boycott came well in advance of any official 
international measure it was the us and britain who go to the 
international organizations to take those measures indeed they 
even forced some countries into participating in those measures 
against their will pressure was exerted on japan germany italy 
and other countries pressure in its open form could be seen every 
day by the us citizen on television or heard or read about in the 
other mass media 
 
on iraqs annexation of kuwait 
 
the return of kuwait to the fold of iraq its motherland from 
which it was long severed and usurped like an infant separated 
from its mother will further strengthen the arab nation and iraq 
in their endeavor to reassert their role on the human and panarab 
levels 
 
on bushs refusal to open a dialogue with saddam 
 
how can bush know saddam hussein or the colleagues of saddam 
hussein in the leadership when he refuses to have a direct dialogue 
with saddam hussein or enter into a direct debate on tv 
 
on how war with iraq would be a disaster 
 
bush wants to bring back the sorrows of america and humanity by 
repeating the vietnam experience only this time in a more radical 
manner and more violent and more casualties 
bush ladies and gentlemen is sending your sons to war for no 
purpose save fatal arrogance 
 
on a solution to the gulf crisis 
 
the solution is in what we have called let us discuss all the 
issues of the middle east at once palestine lebanon and the 
gulf in the security council and with one aim is to come up with 
universal standards taking into consideration the specificity of 
each case 
 
on the food embargo and iraqi children 
 
you should remember that thousands of children in iraq will die 
because of malnutrition as a consequence of lack of milk and many 
of them and many people will lack will their health will 
deteriorate because of lack of adequate food and medicine and the 
milk of children 
 
on the taking of western hostages 
 
those who are speaking about foreigners prohibited from 
traveling from iraq they should remember that the people of iraq 
are prohibited from leaving and they are hostages because they 
have no way of traveling 
 
on the air blockade and iraqkuwait unity 
 
some of you are speaking about blockading air travel have you 
ever heard have you heard of such measures when bush is told 
why are you against union unity between iraq and kuwait and you 
did not object to the unity between east and west germany 
 
on world opinion against iraq 
 
what we worry about is the judgment of god on the final day and 
the judgment of history and our people and we respect world public 
opinion when this world public opinion is based on objective facts 
otherwise world public opinion is nothing but the result of satan

milwaukee a city of 600000 has seen its murder rate jump by 
more than half to 187 per 100000 residents between 1988 and 1989 
that translated into a record 116 homicides in 1989 already this 
year 115 killings have been recorded a decade ago there were 
fewer than 100 homicides in all of wisconsin 
of even greater concern is the randomness of three killings in 
milwaukee this month 
nineyearold shereker wilkins whose family recently fled a 
chicago housing project was lying on her mothers bed saturday 
night after celebrating her birthday when a stray bullet pierced 
the bedroom wall and struck her in the head she died 10 hours 
later her mother couldnt afford the funeral 
i wanted to get away from the drug dealers gangs shootings 
the projects and make a new start for my kids said ruby wilkins 
i thought i had moved somewhere where i would be safe 
a week earlier a 17yearold was accused of randomly selecting 
and executing charles davis 19 to prove in a street gang 
initiation rite that he knew how to kill davis a high school 
dropout had recently earned a degree from milwaukee area technical 
college and got a job at a lawn mower factory 
in the same neighborhood tammy reilly 17 was killed saturday 
by an errant blast from a sawedoff shotgun as she listened to 
music in a relatives apartment 
its going to take a long time for this community to ever 
heal theyre are just too many scars said queen hyler founder 
of stop the violence a citizen group im not going to sit here 
and watch them bury another 9yearold without shaking this city 
up 
ms hyler isnt alone in her efforts city and county officials 
this week began drawing up emergency measures to enforce gun 
registration 
in chicago 628 slayings have been recorded so far this year 
111 more than all of last year the city council this week began 
emergency hearings to seek new ways to control drugs and gangs 
in new york city 16 children have been shot since july 22 and 
six have died police said mayor david dinkins has also issued 
calls for tighter gun controls 
in milwaukee police chief philip arreola refused interviews 
this week and instructed his officers not to discuss the spate of 
killings 
community activists blame the rising crime rate on doubledigit 
unemployment and inadequate funding for schools drug 
rehabilitation and counseling for gang members 
we said in 1989 if you dont help us on the front side then 
youll have to pay for it on the back side ms varnado said 
the back side is that our babies are dying 
said ms hyler you have to live around the bullets you have 
to see the mothers crying you have to be afraid to come out of 
your door you have to see murders when youre living like that 
you know what the problem is

a us drug agent patrolling a major 
cocaineproducing region with bolivian antinarcotics police and 
other american agents was wounded by drug traffickers in an ambush 
the us ambassador reported 
police returned the fire and killed at least one of the machine 
gunwielding traffickers us ambassador robert gelbard said 
tuesday the agent was shot in the arm and leg but not seriously 
hurt 
the ambush monday was the most serious confrontation between 
traffickers and bolivian police and us drug enforcement 
administration agents in recent years poor communications from the 
remote region prevented the news from reaching official circles 
until tuesday 
the traffickers reacted in a violent way because they are 
beginning to feel the affects of the us and bolivian antidrug 
operations gelbard said 
police and agents were on a routine patrol in the chapare 
cocaproducing region when at least 20 heavily armed traffickers 
fired on them the ambassador told the associated press the 
chapare is in the center of bolivia about 250 miles east of la 
paz 
traffickers also fired on usdonated helicopters that were 
sent in to rescue the wounded agent 
at least two bolivian policemen were missing 
bolivian police units have been mobilized in the area in the 
effort to capture the traffickers 
bolivia is the secondlargest cocaine producer in the world 
after colombia 
the chapare an area the size of new jersey produces an 
estimated onethird of the coca leaves that eventually are made 
into cocaine paste and further processed into pure cocaine 
the dea has been operating in bolivia since the early 1970s but 
its efforts have increased markedly in the region the last five 
years there are an estimated 60 us dea border patrol agents and 
military advisers in bolivia 
the ambush took place near the village of isinuta a major 
cocaleaf production and cocaine paste distribution center in the 
chapare

at least once a week from his 
vantage point atop clinch mountain francis collins files an 
intelligence report of sorts 
he calls state officials to tell them just how red yellow and 
gold the forests below his restaurant are becoming 
collins is one of a small band of color observers who will 
alert the rest of north carolina kentucky and tennessee when fall 
color is at its peak 
spectacular foliage may be most closely associated with new 
england an estimated 3 million leaf peepers from across the 
country visit that region each fall but it also brings thousands 
to the southern appalachians 
the three southern states have formed a loose network of color 
watchers to help tourists plan their trips 
many of the observers are forestry or recreation officials 
some like collins are volunteers regular folk with time on 
their hands and an eye for color the reddishorange of the sugar 
maple the solid fiery red of the sweet gum tree the yellows of 
the elm hackberry and tulip poplar and the splash of green of the 
fir 
some watch from their front porches others from their cars and 
trucks as they drive through the forests on these warm september 
days and cool evenings 
as long as ive lived around these hills you can pretty well 
guess at it collins said were setting right up on top and we 
can pretty much see the world 
and the way things are shaping up now the peak will be the 
third week of october collins said he guessed now that maybe 15 
percent of the leaves have changed on the mountaintop in lower 
elevations a few leaves are turning now 
admittedly theres not a real scientific sample said bob 
miller spokesman for the great smoky mountains national park park 
officials look at the trees each week from late september to early 
november to estimate a percentage 
collins has read up on his trees and keeps a close eye on the 
subtle changes in a pinch he can seek some advice from some of 
the oldtimers who come by 
most people helping the state simply know trees 
the only way ive got to go is the degree of color said 
james smith of rockwood a grocerystore owner and color observer 
last year i was raised in the country so i know most of the 
trees 
smith and collins agreed 1990 has the makings of a good year for 
color the summer was hot there was rain late in the season and 
fall has arrived with warm days and cool nights 
it looks like were going to have a good change collins 
said

lower his 5 million bail has been denied by a california appeals 
court 
the court without comment turned down the request tuesday from 
the arizona developer blamed by regulators for the nations biggest 
thrift collapse the 2 billion failure of his lincoln savings amp 
loan 
keating was indicted last week on charges of swindling investors 
in nowworthless junk bonds sold through the irvinebased sampl

high price for freedom but he added you cant consider mr 
keating without thinking of robert vesco the financier who fled 
the country while under investigation during the nixon 
administration

from jail defense attorney stephen c neal said earlier he would 
pursue every avenue to get keating out the next appeal would be to

gov bill clements says he will appeal a 
ruling that the states method of financing its schools remains 
unconsitutional 
state district judge scott mccown ruled tuesday that the 14 
billion overhaul adopted earlier this year in response to a texas 
supreme court decision still doesnt give schools substantially 
equal access to funds 
instead the rich districts are left rich the poor districts 
poor he said 
mccown gave legislators until sept 1 1991 to again reform the 
33millionstudent system which relies on state and federal aid 
and local propery taxes 
if a suitable plan is not devised by then mccown said he may 
stop the spending of tax money on schools or order how the money 
can be spent 
i dont agree with his judgment at all the governor said 
hes a young judge perhaps the supreme court in its review will 
reconsider that opinion 
the judge ruled that financial inequities between schools are 
caused by the wide range in property values across the state 
what the rich districts spend creates educational 
opportunities for their children that are denied the children of 
poor districts he said 
rick gray a lawyer for poor districts that challenged the new 
system was jubilant 
we think its a great day for all schoolchildren and we hope 
the legislature will set about the task of fixing the system in the 
future he said 
the overhaul was adopted in june after four special legislative 
sessions among other things it raised taxes to add 528 million 
for schools during the 199091 year 
poor districts had argued that the new plan was no different 
from the old setup which was scrapped by the texas supreme court 
in a 90 ruling last year 
texas is one of a dozen states where courts have overturned 
school finance systems in recent years others include kentucky 
new jersey kansas wisconsin california connecticut washington 
west virginia wyoming arkansas and montana 
clements leaves office in january the gubernatorial nominees 
democrat ann richards and republican clayton williams both oppose 
new taxes 
i think that the people are going to be very interested in 
knowing exactly how they propose to solve the problem without any 
new money said education commissioner wn kirby

new york city is reviving a program to 
distribute condoms to students because of the continued rise in 
aids and unwanted pregnancies 
we see both these things as in crisis proportions in certain 
communities carmen rivera director of mayor david dinkins 
office of health policy said tuesday 
city schools chancellor joseph fernandez is preparing the 
proposal with backing from the mayor 
james vlasto a spokesman for fernandez said the details were 
still being worked out but rivera said the condoms would be 
distributed through health clinics in 20 junior high and high 
schools which serve tens of thousands of students 
the school system briefly distributed condoms in 1986 but 
stopped because of opposition from several board of education 
members including the current president gwendolyn baker the 
roman catholic archdiocese also opposed the program 
rivera said most of the seven board members including baker 
now support the plan five of the current board members were not 
there in 1986

china today applauded its diplomatic rebound from 
last years status as an object of world scorn to this years as 
respected participant in un deliberations on the persian gulf 
this year our nations foreign relations have made gratifying 
progress declared a frontpage peoples daily editorial the 
newspapers editorials are written by the top communist party 
leadership and amount to policy statements 
china is winning more and more friends worldwide and a good 
international prestige the editorial said it maintained that 
this vindicated chinas domestic policies including its violent 
crushing of a massive studentled movement for democracy in june 
1989 
that incident in which hundreds of unarmed civilians were 
killed caused the industrialized democracies to freeze highlevel 
exchanges with china and curb soft loans but the sanctions have 
recently shown signs of crumbling due to chinas release of 
hundreds of political prisoners and its cooperation in approving 
un security council resolutions punishing iraq 
the peoples daily said chinas foreign policy gains were a 
vivid reflection of our countrys independent selfinitiated and 
peaceful foreign policy 
since last year international forces completely hostile to 
china raised an antichina tide and brazenly interfered in chinas 
internal affairs established sanctions against our country and 
plotted to isolate china 
china did not knuckle under to foreign pressure and continued 
to carry out the basic line set by our party of building socialism 
with chinese characteristics 
it indirectly defended the armys june 1989 attack on unarmed 
protesters saying just think if a nation of 11 billion people 
has daily turmoil and cant manage its economy how can it gain the 
respect and trust of other peoples 
the editorial also pointed up chinas renewed interest in its 
discarded 1960s role as a leader of the third world it said that 
strengthening cooperation with third world countries was the basic 
point of chinas foreign policy and championed the third world 
call for a more equal distribution of wealth and power among 
nations 
chinas biggest foreign relations gains over the past year have 
been with nonwestern countries beijing opened or restored 
relations with namibia saudi arabia and indonesia and is expected 
to establish ties with singapore before years end 
china also recently has made repeated overtures to japan and the 
west it sent education minister li tieying to japan and a group of 
mayors to the united states while giving warm highlevel 
receptions toanese and western businessmen visiting beijing 
since china cooperated on approving un sanctions on trade with 
iraq there have been indications that its freezeout by japan and 
the west is nearing an end 
the group of seven leading industrialized nations at a meeting 
this week in washington expressed openness to restoring loans to 
china 
last week japan sent its first ccbinetlevel minister to beijing 
since june 1989 when education minister kosuke hori arrived for the 
opening of the asian games japan also has indicated willingness to 
restore development aid to china 
a bill was submitted tuesday to the us house of 
representatives proposing that chinas preferential trade status be 
canceled but congress is not expected to pass the measure and the 
white house has indicated it would veto it

police boosted patrols in the area 
where five students were slain after crime laboratory results 
failed to link any suspects to the killings a newspaper reported 
today 
it wasnt certain however whether the test results last week 
cleared edward lewis humphrey or any other suspects in the stabbing 
deaths or if they just failed to support existing suspicions the 
gainesville sun reported 
nor was it clear whether all tests had been completed the 
newspaper said 
police last week announced steppedup night patrols where the 
bodies of the five students were found last month four victims 
attended the university of florida the fifth was a student at the 
citys santa fe community college 
the beefedup patrols were ordered after the task force received 
the results of tests and after the apparent failure of intense 
searches of woods frequented by humphrey an 18yearold freshman 
at the university the newspaper said citing law enforcement 
sources it did not identify 
among the items that had been taken by investigators for testing 
were pubic hair and blood samples from humphrey and another 
suspect stephen michael bates 30 they are jailed on unrelated 
charges neither has been charged in the slayings 
other items collected for testing included semen blood and a 
single pubic hair found at one or more of the murder scenes and on 
a knife found in a milk jug at humphreys home in indialantic 
authorities said 
humphreys lawyer jr russo told the sun he had no knowledge 
of any test results 
task force members would not comment on lab tests the newspaper 
said 
a police spokesman did not immediately return a telephone call 
late tuesday from the associated press

a 14yearold girl took revenge on two 
playmates by inviting them to a picnic and serving them a peanut 
butter and jelly sandwich and grape drink laced with poison police 
say neither youngster was seriously hurt 
the girl told friends she got the idea of putting rat poison in 
the sandwich from the movie heathers an rrated black comedy 
featuring teenage murder and a tight clique of popular girls king 
county police said 
other girls invited to the picnic and croquet party were aware 
that a sandwich had been laced with rat poison and some grape drink 
had been mixed with a household cleanser police spokesman tony 
burtt said tuesday 
the incident involved girls from at least three families sept 
16 and was being investigated as a possible criminal assault 
police said 
detectives were awaiting results of food tests before deciding 
whether to seek criminal charges in juvenile court burtt said 
an 11yearold girl had a stomach ache after taking several 
bites of the sandwich and a 9yearold vomited after sipping the 
drink police said 
none of the children was identified 
the dispute erupted partly because one girl apparently hid a 
videotape of heathers and then claimed another girl had it the 
mother of the girl who got the grape drink told the valley daily 
news 
its scary because the girl thats supposed to have done all 
this was a friend of my daughters the mother said theyve 
been good friends for a year and they used to spend the night at 
each others houses 
the mother of the 14yearold denied her daughter planned the 
poisoning in an interview in todays daily news she blamed two 
other 11yearold playmates at the picnic 
at the very least they were more than just witnesses said 
the mother whose name the paper withheld to avoid identifying the 
children 
police were told the dispute also involved some clothing and 
jewelry one girl was accused of taking 
two girls told police they were at the 14yearolds home the 
day she came up with the plan officers said 
police said the 14yearold made peanut butter and jelly 
sandwiches and put them in plastic bags rat poison was hidden in 
one sandwich which was cut and wrapped differently so it could be 
picked from the others 
neighborhood children came to the picnic at a baseball field 
where the 14yearold said she was going to pretend to make up 
with one girl then giv her the tainted sandwich police said the 
teenager said it would only make her throw up other children 
later told police 
the girls were playing croquet the movie heathers contains 
two scenes in which teenage girls play croquet

the united states expects to reduce its 
300000 troops in europe by at least a third over the next five 
years but does not plan a total pullout th american ambassador 
to nato said today 
there are very important opportunities for reducing our forces 
and for restructuring them in the changing europe william h 
taft iv told journalists at the end of a brief visit to neutral 
sweden 
we expect to see within the next five years a reduction of 
at least a third of us troops in europe from 300000 to 
200000 taft said if things go well we could see further 
reductions 
he also said that other countries in the north atlantic treaty 
organization are considering a us request to send ground troops 
to join american british french and turkish soldiers facing iraqi 
forces in the persian gulf region 
he did not name the countries considering the request other 
nato countries are west germany belgium italy greece denmark 
norway canada iceland luxembourg netherlands portugal and 
spain 
secretary of state james a baker iii has said soldiers and 
airplanes from other nations would be welcome even if the numbers 
were only symbolic in the effort to force iraq to withdraw from 
kuwait 
taft said all nato countries have contributed military vessels 
to the international armada enforcing an embargo on trade with 
iraq except iceland and luxembourg which dont have any 
he said west germany sent ships to the mediterranean 
were happy with the positive responses we would like to 
see the european allies do more taft said 
we would not be happy if theres nothing more he said 
but we havent given up 
international cooperation on the persian gulf crisis is 
important because taft said were setting up the new postcold 
war order of things and the world needs to make it very clear 
that invading a country and taking it over wont be accepted 
taft said the haphazard reaction of european community 
members to the gulf crisis had shown that political cooperation 
will have to be effected before it the ec can expand to military 
affairs 
taft said the united states supports the development of 
european defense capability but foresaw no complete withdrawal of 
us military forces from europe despite the fall of communist 
governments in eastern europe and improved relations with the 
soviets 
he said no credible politician in the united states had proposed 
a smaller american presence in europe than 80000 
the united states is not considering and no serious 
politicians in the united states are suggesting withdrawal of all 
us forces in europe taft said he added that no european 
country not even the soviet union wants to see the united 
states disengaged from europe 
it is the link the nato alliance provides from the continent 
with one superpower to another superpower its a balancing force 
a force of stability he said

doctors may be able to predict a persons 
tendency to smoke by knowing whether the individual has ever 
suffered depression a researcher says 
a report in todays edition of the journal of the american 
medical association says people who have suffered major depression 
are twice as likely to smoke and half as likely to succeed at 
quitting 
people talk about some sort of addictive personality but 
dont know what makes people more addictive than others said one 
of the authors dr alexander h glassman chief of clinical 
pharmacology at the college of physicians and surgeons at new 
yorks columbia university 
this seems to show that we can predict who is going to be more 
addictable to a drug 
though people sometimes say they smoke to relieve anxiety and 
tension the study failed to find a link between smokers and people 
who had been diagnosed with phobias or panic disorders it did find 
that smoking was four times as common among alcoholics glassman 
said 
researchers analyzed data collected from 3213 people in the st 
louis metropolitan area in the early 1980s as part of a national 
psychiatric survey 
they found that among those who smoked 66 percent had 
suffered depression at one time in their lives and that among 
those who didnt smoke 29 percent had suffered depression 
the study didnt look into whether depression helps prompt 
smoking or vice versa but glassman said tuesday he believes the 
finding implies that people who get depressed are somehow more 
vulnerable to nicotine to drugs 
a smoker was defined as someone who had smoked daily for at 
least a month at some point in his life major depression was 
defined as a sad or depressed mood persisting for at least two 
weeks and including such symptoms as sleep disturbance and eating 
disorders 
the study was done by the new york state psychiatric institute 
columbia university the university of vermont in burlington and 
washington university in st louis 
previous studies have linked cigarette smoking and depressive 
disorders among people who have sought psychiatric care this study 
is the first to analyze the rates from the community at large 
regardless of whether the subjects had ever sought treatment for 
depression the study said 
the study found that people with histories of depression had a 
14 percent success rate in trying to quit and those without such 
problems had a 31 percent success rate 
commenting on the study university of chicago psychiatry 
professor david tobin said the finding was important in identifying 
subgroups of smokers who may need a more aggressive treatment to 
quit 
tobin said many smokers will buy a book or go to a group program 
for a few sessions but wont seek a specialists help for the 
emotional upheaval associated with trying to quit 
they are taking a very difficult problem and not devoting very 
many resources in terms of time or money he said and if they 
are depressed on top of it they are going to try to give up 
smoking with all that stacked against them 
an unrelated study also published in todays journal said 
smokers who try to quit with the aid of nicotine gum may render the 
gum useless by drinking colas coffee and other beverages 
researchers collected saliva from eight male smokers having 
half of them rinse their mouths with water and half with coffee and 
cola after chewing 
they found that rinsing with coffee or cola acidified the saliva 
and virtually eliminated that amount of nicotine which the body 
could absorb 
the study was done by researchers at the national institute on 
drug abuse in baltimore the albert b chandler medical center in 
lexington ky and the university of kentucky in lexington

the soviet parliament today adopted a new freedom 
of religion law easing decades of strict prohibitions on religious 
instruction at home and in private schools at a time of widespread 
religious revival 
the new law directs political leaders who had in the past 
actively discouraged religious services confiscated churches 
repressed religious groups and preached atheism not to interfere 
with religious activities 
it allows religious groups to set up societies brotherhoods 
associations and other fraternal groups and specifies that the 
government will finance neither religious activities nor 
propaganda of atheism 
but official tolerance for religion has increased dramatically 
since mikhail s gorbachev came to power in 1985 his mother is a 
practicing russian orthodox and last year he acknowledged that he 
had been baptized as a child 
the law adopted 3411 with one abstention says religious 
organizations can send people abroad for spiritual study and 
receive foreign students in the soviet union 
it calls for the establishment of a panel of religious leaders 
to advise the government on human rights issues and permits the 
government to continue returning churches for use as religious 
buildings 
many churches have fallen into disrepair or been used by the 
government as storehouses offices and even factories 
the law guarantees the right to study and teach religion either 
individually or with others 
but a clause allowing secular facilities to be used for 
religious instructions after regular school hours touched off a 
fierce debate and was defeated by one chamber of the legislature 
lawmaker genrikh igityan of armenia argued that every educated 
person must study religion and that comparative world religions 
should be on every curriculum 
but sergei ryabchenko from the ukraine said teaching 
contradictory religious doctrines in schools could turn his 
republic into another beirut because of friction between the 
roman catholic and russian orthodox churches 
the clause was approved by the council of the union but defeated 
by the council of nationalities and will have to be resolved by a 
joint committee 
the number of christian baptisms and reopening of churches has 
soared since gorbachev came to power 
the head of the russian orthodox church patriarch alexi ii has 
met with the soviet leadership for the first time in more than 40 
years and important religious centers like the pechorsky monastery 
of kiev have been returned to the church 
on sunday a divine liturgy was held in the kremlins uspensky 
cathedral the first full service allowed in russias most 
important cathedral since 1918 
jews are also enjoying greater religious freedom and a revival 
of islam in central asia is increasing the number of seminary 
students and mosques 
scores of religious dissidents of all faiths have been freed 
from jails and prison camps 
religious leaders including alexi ii and representatives of 
the seventhday adventist church and the soviet jewish community 
attended todays parliamentary debate 
alexi addressing the lawmakers requested permission to set up 
a publishing house and use its income to repair broken down 
churches the legislature had no immediate response 
alexi wearing a black clerical robe and white headpiece topped 
with a gold cross urged the government not to come between the 
church and the people 
the russian church has already experienced attempts on a 
political basis to destroy the unity of religious life he said 
donations to religious organizations have been and remain 
taxfree the new law however cuts the tax rate from 69 percent 
to 35 percent on the profits of enterprises affiliated with 
religious groups 
one ambiguous area of the new law concerns the military the law 
says military commanders cannot interfere with the participation of 
soldiers in religious services during their free time 
but col vilyen martirosyan a lawmaker from the ukraine asked 
the legislature whether military commanders now will be able to 
organize services for religious soldiers 
a member of the committee that drafted the law said that issue 
would have to be worked out in the future

rival christian forces battled with 
mortars tanks and rocketpropelled grenades today in one of the 
most serious breaches of their ceasefire in four months 
police said a woman was killed and another wounded in the 
flareup which occurred at daybreak between rebel gen michel 
aouns troops and christian warlord samir geageas lebanese forces 
militia 
thunderous shell blasts jolted thousands of residents from bed 
in beiruts christian sector they scurried into basements and 
underground bomb bunkers in the embattled districts of sin elfil 
and nabaa police said 
the fighting tapered into sporadic sniping at midmorning police 
said traffic between the moslem and christian sectors of the 
capital was not affected by the hostilities 
each side blamed the other for the violation of the may 17 
ceasefire which halted 15 weeks of savage fighting between aouns 
15000 troops and geageas 6000 militiamen for mastery of the 
christian enclave north and northeast of beirut 
by police count at least 1045 people were killed and 2798 
wounded in the power struggle 
the fighting caused an estimated 1 billion worth of damage and 
forced about onethird of the enclaves 1 million population to 
flee to safer areas 
aoun lost his sea outlets in the fighting and geageas men now 
control 80 percent of the christian enclave the area covers 310 
square miles of coastal and mountainous territory 
todays battle came amid reports that president elias hrawis 
government based in moslem west beirut plans to tighten an 
economic blockade of the zone controlled by aoun 
several beirut newspapers said hrawis troops under gen emile 
lahoud might close all inlets to aouns zone to ban food supplies 
for his army 
fuel supplies and money transfers to aouns enclave have been 
banned by hrawis government since midjuly in a bid to force the 
maverick general into submission 
hrawi aoun geagea and lahoud are all maronite catholics the 
largest christian sect in lebanon it has dominated power in 
lebanon since independence from france in 1943 
aoun has refused to recognize hrawi who was elected president 
by parliament nov 24 with a mandate to enforce a peace plan 
brokered by the arab league to end 15 years of moslemchristian 
civil war 
hrawi who is backed by neighboring syria lebanons main power 
broker signed into law friday a package of constitutional reforms 
giving the 55 percent moslem majority of lebanons 4 million 
population an equal share of power for the first time since 
independence 
hrawi called on aoun to join the peace process or face a 
military attack 
the general said he would cooperate with hrawis government 
only when all moslems and christian militias that fought in the 
civil war including geageas lebanese forces were disbanded

performance that has gone on for 18 months the government said 
today 
the commerce department reported that orders for durable goods 
items expected to last more than three years totaled a seasonally 
adjusted 127 billion following a revised 27 percent gain in july 
but excluding defense and transportation overall orders would 
have fallen even steeper without either category orders would 
have dropped 16 percent the department said 
many analysts had expected the overall decline in orders which 
have zigzagged throughout the year up during three months and 
down for four including a 105 percent plunge in january 
durable goods orders are a key economic barometer of 
manufacturing industry plans for production a decrease in orders 
could result in a slump in that sector and subsequent layoffs

factory jobs were lost in august it was the 16th time out of 17 
months that manufacturing jobs declined 
since reaching a postrecession peak in january 1989 the

orders in the key category of nondefense capital goods often a 
barometer of business plans to expand and modernize plunged 112 
percent to 354 billion after gaining 101 percent in july but

percent 
the pattern of orders in august was mixed both electrical 
machinery and transportation categories posted gains while 
nonelectrical machinery and primary metals orders fell 
orders for transportation equipment rose 13 percent to 352 
billion mostly for motor vehicles aircraft orders fell about 3 
billion transportation orders jumped 45 percent in july

iran has called on moslems around the 
world to stage antiamerican demonstrations on friday to protest 
the presence of the usled multinational forces in saudi arabia 
the islamic propagation organization said in a statement that 
moslems worldwide should protest the filthy presence of alien 
troops in the persian gulf and saudi arabia irans islamic 
republic news agency reported today 
iran has condemned iraqs aug 2 invasion of kuwait but it has 
deplored the deployment of us forces to prevent a possible iraqi 
attack on saudi arabia and to enforce a unimposed economic 
embargo on baghdad 
the iranians have been particularly angered at the presence of 
nonmoslem forces in saudi arabia home to mecca and medina 
islams holiest shrines 
would wolves guard the sheep the statement asked according 
to the irna report which was monitored in nicosia 
oh moslems is it not the time to awake from slumber it 
asked 
irna quoted the radical newspaper jomhuri islami as saying 
demonstrations will celebrate iraqs capitulation in a recent 
peace treaty with iran 
iraqi president saddam hussein facing the embargo and the 
usled forces suddenly made peace with iran last month formally 
ending the 198088 war and two years of deadlocked peace talks 
there will also be jubilation that iraq which was armed to 
the teeth by western countries has now become a threat to the west 
and deploys these same armaments against the west and those like 
kuwait which financed iraqs war against iran jomhuri islami 
said 
next friday the whole country will be filled with the shouts 
of death to america proving to the world that in the eyes of the 
moslem nation of iran the united states is the main party 
responsible for the imposition of war on iran the paper said 
iranian president hashemi rafsanjani considered a pragmatist 
is believed to want to end more than a decade of antiwestern 
sentiments in iran to attract investment and technology for the 
countrys postwar economy the protest call is seen as a show of 
defiance by his vehemently antiamerican radicals rivals

us marines at the tip 
of the spear defending saudi oilfields were told by their boss 
today to expect a long desert stay 
i dont want to hear about any more questions about how long 
youre going to be here commandant gen alfred gray told marines 
at a combat support camp in the northern saudi desert near the main 
highways to the countrys major oil installations 
he also said the marines should be prepared to shift to offense 
if the kingdom is attacked 
gray speaking to reporters after his 45minute pep talk said 
he was confident the multinational force in saudi arabia and the 
gulf region could stop any iraqi offensive but he refused to say 
whether the usled forces were capable of pushing iraq out of 
kuwait saying the question was speculative 
during his speech to the men gray said we have a very very 
powerful flexible and most useful force afloat and ashore ready 
to do whatever needs to be done were going to play for keeps if 
that is required 
for now he said the mission was defensive and 13 ships were 
headed to the region with supplies needed to sustain the marine 
force 
but should hostilities break out gray said we all know the 
best defense is a good offense 
grays pep talk delivered through a bullhorn was full of 
praise for the marines but equally rich with reminders that their 
stay in the desert is unlikely to end soon 
how long are we going to be here he asked rhetorically 
well were going to be here until we get done what has to be 
done 
he then essentially ordered the troops not to complain 
there will be no morale problem because i say there will 
be morale there will also be no boredom 
gray said that under normal circumstances marines are deployed 
for six months and then brought home for 15 to 18 months 
it would make sense if we could hold to that as best we can 
gray told reporters but we may not b able to because we have 
as i tried to indicate enormous global commitments i think they 
understand that 
another complication would be the need to coordinate with the 
navy to make sure enough ships were available to make the personnel 
changes he said 
im well aware there comes a point when you need a change of 
scenery he said suggesting that change could come within saudi 
arabia let your commandant worry about that 
gray reminded the marines to be on guard against possible 
terrorist attacks saying marines are always the no 1 target in 
this part of the world for terrorist attack 
youre the tip of the spear he said 
gray said he believed the american deployment had persuaded 
iraqi president saddam hussein not to continue into saudi arabia 
after taking kuwait aug2 
i believe that saddam hussein and the iraqi military fully 
intended to invade this region of saudi arabia he declared 
they didnt theyve been stopped youve won a big one 
already and you havent had to fire a shot

hispanic leaders are planning ways to present 
a united political voice in the 1992 presidential election 
about 100 hispanic leaders met tuesday and resolved not to let 
divisions within the community sap their political strength as 
some say occurred during the presidential campaign two years ago 
led by former san antonio mayor henry cisneros bronx ny 
borough president fernando ferrer and denver mayor federico pena 
the leaders adopted a blueprint for 1992 and took stands on five 
pressing hispanic issues 
the leaders plan to establish the national hispanic agenda as an 
organization that can speak on political issues all hispanics 
share 
it represents an attempt to speak with one voice across the 
differences that divide the hispanic community cubans puerto 
ricans mexicans republicans democrats new yorkers floridians 
texans californians cisneros said 
as a first step the leaders urged an adjustment of the 1990 
census that appears to have undercounted minorities they also 
pressed for passage of the civil rights bill and repeal of the 
employer sanctions provision in the 1986 immigration law 
the hispanic subgroups are now agreeing and supporting issues 
in a real call for unity said robert calderin director of a 
conference of new york legislators called somos uno spanish for 
we are one 
its the first time we have had a cohesive group of people 
working together said david pena a miami attorney who attended 
the meeting on behalf of the hispanic national bar association 
our hope is to develop a shared agenda and be united said 
cecilia munoz of the national council of la raza a 
washingtonbased research and advocacy group 
hispanic leaders want to make sure their political potential is 
not squandered in 1992 cisneros said 
this is the starting of a process that leads to a 1992 policy 
statement that is useful in the presidential election and that 
has come from a deliberate and systematic dialogue with community 
organizations all around the country he said 
at 21 million hispanics comprise the fastestgrowing minority 
group in the country demographers estimate hispanics ill become 
the largest minority population sometime this decade 
the 100 hispanic leaders at the national hispanic agenda meeting 
represented republicans and democrats and groups as varied as the 
us hispanic chamber of commerce and the us catholic conference 
the leaders praised president bushs executive order signed 
monday setting up an advisory committee to develop ways to improve 
education of hispanics but they said bush should make sure young 
spanishspeaking children are able to learn in their native 
language 
the leaders also urged congress to pass legislation giving a 
statehood plebiscite or vote to puerto rico and allow puerto 
ricans in the continental united states to participate polls 
indicate a slight majority of puerto ricans favor statehood 
bush who backs statehood for puerto rico has urged congress to 
pass legislation mandating that whatever puerto ricans decide be 
implemented by 1993 a bill allowing the plebiscite is pending on 
the house floor but a similar senate measure is mired in 
committee

iraq bitterly attacked its former ally 
the soviet union today and said arabs would not be friendly toward 
a country in the alliance of american hostility 
the tirade by the official iraqi news agency was in response to 
soviet foreign minister eduard shevardadzes speech tuesday to the 
united nations the news agency claimed the soviets were bribed to 
make the comments 
in another development baghdad radio broadcast president saddam 
husseins message to the american people parts of which were aired 
on us television on tuesday night 
also officials announced there will be more food rationing 
starting this weekend because of the un trade embargo imposed 
after iraq invaded kuwait trade and finance minister mohammed 
mahdi saleh said the rationing will include rice flour cooking 
oil sugar and tea 
in a tone that clearly shows the bribe given by american and 
its allies the oil sheiks ussr foreign minister shevardnadze spoke 
from the united nations forum in a threatening voice the iraqi 
news agency said 
we tell shevardnadze if you are not concerned about the 
relations of friendship with the arabs and want to be dragged into 
the alliance of american hostility then the arabs will not be 
concerned about the likes of you 
shevardnadze who sits at president mikhail s gorbachevs right 
hand in the soviet power structure criticized saddam as a 
terrorist threatening the world order and suggested his seizure of 
kuwait might call for a war crimes trial the soviet minister also 
raised the prospect of un military force against iraq if economic 
sanctions fail to force saddam to give up kuwait 
the united nations has the power to suppress acts of 
aggression shevardnadze said in his speech at the united 
nations 
during the cold war standoff between the united states and the 
soviet union iraq was a chief middle east ally of moscow which 
was the main arms supplier to saddam husseins military 
the soviet union announced it would stop supplying arms to 
baghdad after iraq invaded kuwait on aug 2 but at first was 
hesitant to back economic sanctions against iraq 
gorbachev and president bush agreed two weeks ago in helsinki 
finland that additional measures might be required one result was 
the un air embargo approved by the security council on tuesday 
baghdad radio denounced the air embargo today and said it was 
imposed on the directives of the hostile policy of bush 
saddams message to the american people defended the invasion of 
kuwait and said it was not without warning 
the 75minute message was featured on newscasts from baghdad and 
was to be broadcast on iraqi television tonight the iraqi news 
agency said 
kuwait constitutes the southern part of iraq which was 
severed by the british in 1913 in preparation for the first world 
war he said 
the rulers of kuwait exploited our preoccupation with the war 
between us and iran to expand further at our expense by using our 
southern oilfields to acquire new oil wells from which to funnel 
additional oil for their benefit 
no warning however repeatedly stated could deter them from 
that course of action saddam said 
saddams message was delivered in washington on tuesday 
excerpts were aired on the major american networks and the cable 
news network decided to show the entire message early today

elections under a plan approved by the united nations 
hun sen turned down a proposal that guerrilla leader prince 
norodom sihanouk join the council as chairman in exchange for 
another seat for hun sens government saying his side also should 
be given the council vice chairmanship that ruined hopes that the

fighting

jordan said today it would abide by a un 
security council order to cut off air traffic in and out of iraq 
and occupied kuwait but it permitted an iraqi airways flight to 
land 
the regularly scheduled flight from baghdad carried 185 people 
and it was not immediately clear what its cargo hold contained 
but jordanian officials said an initial check of the un 
resolution indicated the arrival was not a violation of the air 
embargo 
the embargo is on cargo shipments only and not passengers 
said one jordanian cabinet minister speaking on condition of 
anonymity according to our initial studying of the resolution 
we understand that it does not bar human traffic 
the security council voted 141 tuesday to prohibit air traffic 
with iraq and kuwait cuba cast the only vote against the 
resolution 
the resolution does not mention passenger planes but says that 
all planes traveling to and from iraq should be checked to make 
sure they are not carrying cargo prohibited by the un trade 
sanctions the resolution prohibits the use of force to stop 
planes but allows for the detention of aircraft 
under certain conditions the council permitted humanitarian 
cargo including food and medical supplies 
an unidentified jordanian transport ministry official was quoted 
by the state news agency petra as saying the civil aviation 
authority and concerned government departments will implement this 
resolution 
the resolution also called on all member states to bar flights 
from their territory to those nations and deny landing rights to 
planes coming from iraq or kuwait

the daily record morristown nj on political trust 
the times mirror survey the people the press and politics 
1990 provides some sobering news and perhaps an ominous 
portent for politicians of every political stripe 
the survey charts a continuing erosion of trust and confidence 
in our two major political parties a deepening cynicism and 
economic polarization that threatens to subvert traditional 
partisan politics or block the effective resolution of social and 
economic issues 
respondents to the survey characterized democrats as incapable 
of governing effectively and the republicans as a political 
instrument of the rich and powerful a pox on both houses 
what is the impact of all this well one effect has been 
obvious for years people have stopped voting eligible voters show 
their cynicism by staying away from the polls more and more people 
are being elected by fewer and fewer americans 
those who do vote reelect incumbents virtually across the 
board 
people who have really had enough may be more inclined to vote 
against any and all incumbents regardless of their political 
stripe 
thats what the times mirror survey is saying they might do if 
they vote at all

statesman journal salem ore on the budget 
the droning noise coming out of washington dcs budget 
negotiations may put the public to sleep but well wake up with a 
jolt when we see what congress inaction has done to us 
unless congress and the president act before oct 1 on a new 
budget that meets grammrudman deficitcutting goals automatic 
cuts of about 100 billion will cause layoffs and massive cuts in 
programs that no one wants to cut thats when well wake up and 
ask our senators and representatives why we must endure inaction at 
a time of fiscal crisis in our country 
they will reply that no one wants to approve tax increases and 
cut budgets so close to an election we reply that if you dont do 
something well vote you out of office not for what you did but 
for what you didnt do

the sun herald gulfport miss on the budget 
the indecisiveness of congressional leaders fumbling around with 
the federal budget may be the highest form of power politics in 
washington but outside the beltway it is inflicting cruel 
economic pain and mental anguish on the federal workers who keep 
the government running 
the victims of this shabby treatment include thousands of 
government employees 
if they were working for a private employer who treated them 
that way even one time let alone year after year for a decade or 
more those same congressional leaders would be calling televised 
hearings and passing laws to punish the offending companies 
but because it is congress itself that is causing the misery 
therell be no hearings no laws no alphabet agency given the task 
of assuring no repetitions of the employee mistreatment 
but congress has been working on the task since last january 
when president bush released his budget proposal after eight 
months congress doesnt seem much closer to agreement than when it 
started 
little time remains before the oct 1 deadline for tee 
grammrudman automatic cuts to kick in negotiators must reach a 
deal and congress must ratify it or grammrudman will mandate cuts 
of up to 40 percent in domestic and military programs 
to prepare for that contingency the government is planning to 
furlough employees that is put them on unpaid leave 
the silver lining in this dark fiscal cloud is the high 
probability that congress will not allow the grammrudman cuts to 
happen the members cant stand the political heat at the last 
minute they will find some way to keep government operating 
and avoid the wrath of mistreated employees 
the saddest part is that voters will undoubtedly reelect most 
of those socalled leaders who will in all likelihood repeat the 
sordid performance next year

shawano wis evening leader on females in the military 
if iraqi troops attack us forces situated in the saudi arabian 
desert women may be among the first casualties 
although regulations prohibit females from combat the us 
forces sent to the middle east as part of operation desert shield 
include many women 
in the saudi desert us women are repairing communications 
arming attack planes and operating supply lines those areas are 
deemed safe by the military brass 
but if the iraqis would strike against the us troops those 
areas probably would be the first to be hit 
the uncertain future of the gulf crisis has not frazzled the 
females who are temporarily stationed in the middle east both 
women and men serve together in the different branches of the us 
armed forces and the females have noted they want to be treated as 
equals 
policies for military women must be adjusted to meet those 
changes in the us armed forces if a woman wants to serve and is 
trained to do so her superiors should be allowed to use her 
without a second thought 
if females are going to be recruited trained and sent to a 
crisis situation it seems foolish to protect them from injury 
while male troops are allowed to fight 
we get paid the same noted a female army lieutenant who was 
deployed as part ofestment firm capital insight said trading was volatile 
with 
bonds buffetted by rumors on subjects ranging from the middle east 
crisis to the budget deficit stalemate 
he said bonds picked up support from tuesdays rebound in the 
dollar the overnight selloff on the tokyo stock market steered 
investors into us dollardenominated holdings including 
government bonds he said 
the market is just jittery about the middle east and the 
budget he said there are a lot of rumors no facts this 
morning except the durable goods number which im not sure anyone 
cared about 
two commerce department reports released today confirmed that 
the economy lacks vigor 
the report on durable goods showed orders to us factories for 
longlasting generally expensive items dropped 08 percent in 
august separately the department reported us personal incomes 
rose just 03 percent in august the slowest pace in four months 
while consumer spending rose 05 percent the lowest in three 
months 
in the secondary market for treasury securities shortterm 
issues and intermediate maturities ranged from 132 point lower to 
132 point higher longterm issues were unchanged to up 116 
point according to telerate inc a financial information service 
the movement of a point is equivalent to a change of 10 in the 
price of a bond with a 1000 face value 
the shearson lehman brothers daily treasury bond index which 
measures price movements on all outstanding treasury issues with 
maturities of a year or longer was up 039 to 113645 by late

mapplethorpes sexually explicit photos in detail to gauge the 
reactions of prospective jurors at the nations first obscenity 
trial of an art gallery and its director 
the contemporary ars center and director dennis barrie are 
charged with obscenity and displaying nude photos of children at a 
mapplethorpe exhibit 
defense lawyers today rejected a prospective juror as jury 
selection moved into the third day marc mezibov the gallerys 
lawyer used a peremptory challenge to remove a retiree who he 
said was not adequately familiar with the communitys contemporary 
social standards 
eight jurors and two alternates are being sought 
on tuesday prosecutors used one of their peremptory challenges 
to dismiss a prospective juror who viewed the mapplethorpe photo 
exhibit 
prosecutor frank prouty sought to have the prospective juror 
removed for cause each side is allowed six peremptory removals 
for which they need to give no reason and an unlimited number of 
challenges for cause in which they must convince a judge that the 
juror is unbiased 
seven of the 175 photos from the exhibit are the basis for the 
criminal charges one photo shows a man urinating into another 
mans mouth others show anal penetration with objects and other 
homosexual or sadomasochistic images 
after describing the seven photographs in detail lawyer h 
louis sirkin asked several prospective jurors are you willing to 
see those photographs before making a decision as to whether any of 
them is obscene 
all answered that they were 
sirkin said later that he didnt describe the photographs for 
shock value although he was interested in seeing the potential 
jurors reaction 
he did not say what he believed the reactions were 
the jury is entitled to know what the photographs show 
sirkin said if theyre going to see them they have a right to 
know whats in them 
the american civil liberties union and the association of art 
museum directors have said this is the nations first obscenity 
prosecution they know of involving an art gallery 
if convicted barrie 43 could get a year in jail and a fine of 
2000 the gallery could be fined 10000 
the mapplethope exhibit now concluding a national tour in 
boston drew more than 80000 viewers during its sevenweek 
cincinnati exhibition ending in may the artist died of aids last 
year 
mezibov tried to determine whether potential jurors had opinions 
about the role of an art museum and the types of photographs that 
should be allowed to be exhibited 
he asked if they would be willing to listen to opinions from art 
experts from outside cincinnati particularly regarding sexually 
graphic photographs 
yes but i have the right to accept or reject those 
opinions one man said 
mezibov asked another prospective juror if there should be laws 
governing what adults are allowed to say 
ive never seen anything i thought there should be a law 
against the woman said

will find mechanisms to ensure that their countrys shrinking 
global reach does not trigger off instability in pacific asia 
given the fact that an eventual us withdrawal from clark and 
subic bay appears in the absence of dramatic geopolitical changes 
to be a fait accompli the question must be whether alternative 
forms of presence are possible that preserve americas stake in the 
region a more limited perhaps rotational presence in the 
philippines could be one answer a shift to other permanent bases 
in pacific asia that facilitate the rapid deployment of us forces 
could be another 
guam and conceivably new zealand are candidates for such a 
role singapores and bruneis offer of facilities to the us 
military while a contribution to retaining american interest in 
regional stability cannot make up for the loss of the 
strategically far superior sites in the philippines 
a permanent us presence in asia is thus a necessity and the 
shape of that presence must keep in mind the unclear contours of 
the new world that is arriving

tass the soviet news agency on a nuclear weapons test ban 
the complete ban on nuclear testing would be the simplest and 
most effective measure for arms control their termination 
would stop the creation of new systems of weapons of mass 
destruction and would prevent upgrading old systems 
the soviet union more than once stated its readiness for any 
negotiations that would promote a universal and complete ban on 
nuclear explosions moscow for instance proposed lowering the 
yields of test explosions and the maximum number of tests per year 
 
the soviet union is prepared to resume a moratorium on nuclear 
explosions on a reciprocal basis with the united states the soviet 
union has already substantially cut its program of nuclear testing 
there have been no nuclear explosions at soviet test ranges for 
about a year 
there are now particularly favorable conditions for settling the 
question of nuclear tests the cold war is fading into the past 
the main obstacles with which the us justified its refusal to 
agree to complete a ban on nuclear explosions have been eliminated 
washington should no longer be concerned about problems involved 
in verifying the observance of a ban on explosions the soviet 
union is prepared to accept any verification procedure 
the talks in geneva have approached a stage where their further 
progress is complicated by differences in the final goals pursued 
by the sides the soviet union sees the main task to be banning 
tests while the us side only seeks to work out measures to 
monitor their continuation 
an end to nuclear explosions remains elusive is not it time for 
the us administration to relate its stance on nuclear testing to 
presentday realities

the guardian london on the soviet union 
the great debate in moscow would make a thrilling tale of 
dialectical passion if it were not such a desperate affair the 
stakes are enormous the economic wellbeing and political 
integrity of the worlds second superpower 
the arguments on both sides are compelling but not decisive 
either alternative the slow road of reform advocated by prime 
minister nikolai ryzhkov or the fast track pressed by economist 
stanislav shatalin could come fatally unstuck 
the central figure still attractive to us but no longer 
unchallenged remains president mikhail gorbachev grappling with a 
problem which may this time prove too massive for even his skills 
in political manipulation 
if we can forget about the gulf crisis for a moment we have to 
recognize that the crisis facing the soviet people could explode 
just as catastrophically if gorbachev takes the wrong path 
almost any economic program might improve life for the soviet 
people if there were the political will to implement it 
gorbachevs adoption of special powers both to tackle the 
economic crisis and maintain public order is a last throw we wish 
him luck but he now needs five aces in one hand to succeed 
 
daily nation nairobi kenya on south african president fw de 
klerks visit to the united states 
south africa is looking to the united states to help end its 
isolation by the rest of the world 
the question however is whether time is ripe for the united 
states and the rest of the world to consider lifting the sanctions 
against pretoria 
we say it is not 
president george bush who appeared warmer toward de klerk than 
he did toward the deputy president of the african national 
congress nelson mandela when he visited washington in june must 
be reminded that apartheid is still very much in place 
bush must be be reminded that pretoria is no less humane no 
less violent or less racist than it has been in the past

its that time of fiscal year again the 
government poised for paralysis and the autumnal sky ready to crash 
down on the nations unsuspecting citizens 
the stage is set as usual for 11thhour budget chaos but this 
round is a little different many federal programs may actually be 
cut by nearly onethird 
the public doesnt have the slightest idea of whats coming 
were talking about a serious disruption in government service 
said stan collender director of federal budget policy for the 
price waterhouse accounting firm 
forget eyeglazing phrases like deficit reduction budget 
negotiations and grammrudman sequesters if congress and president 
bush dont agree on tax hikes and spending cuts by monday the 
government shrinks drastically and instantly 
for anyone who thinks thats a great idea here are a few things 
to consider 
the federal aviation administration would have to reduce from 
40000 to 34000 the flights handled by 41 major airports and close 
down 250 weather stations at night forcing cancellation of night 
flights 
the agriculture department would have to lower subsidies for 
major commodities lay off chicken inspectors and close for two 
days a week the local offices where needy farmers get housing and 
operating loans 
the department of health and human services would have to cut 
medicare payments by 2 percent medicare and social security checks 
would be delayed due to personnel cuts 
the bureau of prisons would have difficulty running federal 
prisons on a reduced staff the marshals service wouldnt be able 
to chase as many fugitives or seize as many criminal assets 
few budgetwatchers expect draconian cuts to last long if they 
materialize at all the white house is hoping the mere threat of 
such a cataclysm technically known as a sequester will force an 
agreement sooner rather than later 
but the choices are not pretty particularly for those lawmakers 
facing the voters in five weeks they can support a budget 
agreement that doubtless will raise taxes and reduce services they 
can resist compromise triggering the drastic spending cuts or 
they can extend the deadline for the automatic cuts admitting 
failure and postponing the inevitable moment of truth 
any decision is politically painful even doing nothing 
said collender 
this would not be the first time a budget impasse dragged beyond 
the start of a fiscal year triggering automatic cuts under the 
1985 grammrudman law but the scale this year is something 
entirely new 
in 1986 there was an 117 billion cut when negotiators could 
not agree on a budget by the start of the fiscal year in 1987 the 
slashes otaled 23 billion but they were repealed after a couple 
of months last year after a partial repeal the cuts amounted to 
162 billion now were up to 85 billion to start with more to 
come in midoctober 
were not talking about a flesh wound as we have in the past 
were talking about traumatic injury to vital organs here said 
norman ornstein a congressional analyst at the american enterprise 
institute 
he and others say the budget paralysis is reinforced by an 
almost total lack of public pressure to get the job done 
one of the problems is that weve seen sequesters before and 
they werent all that bad said cox something really awful may 
have to happen before people realize how screwed up we are 
the budget deadline is only one of three congress faces next 
week the first of the fiscal year missing any one of them is an 
invitation to upheaval 
besides trying to avert the automatic cuts congress must also 
raise the debt ceiling or the country will run out of borrowing 
capacity and pass a temporary spending bill to keep the 
government going while budget decisions are made 
youre going to see a spectacle of disruption and acrimony 
cox predicted unhappily 
but ornstein said the ritualized lastminute hysteria messy as 
it may be generally produces compromises that have kept the 
deficit in check the solution may be to ignore the process he 
said because it stands up to close scrutiny about as well as 
sausagemaking 
the agreement we get is no less substantial he said but 
by the time it comes about were all nauseous

pope john paul ii suggested wednesday that 
the nazis killed millions of jews in poland during world war ii 
because they wanted to disgrace his native country 
the assassins did all this on our land perhaps to cover it in 
infamy the pope said in remarks to polish pilgrims during his 
weekly general audience but one cant cover a country in infamy 
with the death of innocent victims 
john paul said jews lived with us through generations side by 
side on the same land 
this people was struck by the terrible death of millions of 
sons and daughters he said first they were branded with a 
special mark then pushed into ghettos into isolated 
neighborhoods then taken to gas chambers to die only because they 
were the sons of this people 
the people which lived with us during many generations 
remained with us after this terrible death of its sons and 
daughters together we await the day of judgment and 
resurrection 
three million polish jews perished in the holocaust at the 
auschwitz death camp in poland 25 million jews from poland and 
other european countries were killed by the nazis

a norwegian multimillionaire made front page 
news wednesday by paying income tax 
complaining about high taxes and hunting for deductions are 
national pastimes in this welfare state and newspapers frequently 
expose tax avoidance schemes used by the rich 
so when knut utstein kloster one of the countrys richest men 
paid more taxes than he owed it was a news sensation 
the shipowner and investor sent a voluntary payment of 130000 
to the oslo tax office explaining that i want to do my part for 
the common good 
actually he would not have had to pay any taxes kloster told 
the dagbladet newspaper complicated tax rules had left him no 
income tax obligation for 1989 since he had invested in new 
projects 
it happened against my will said kloster who has an 
estimated personal fortune of 44 million everyone should pay 
tax 
tax officials told dagbladet that the voluntary payment was 
probably the largest ever made in norway

sweden helped the united states spy on 
the soviet union in the 1950s in violation of this countrys policy 
of neutrality a former defense agency specialist said wednesday 
john edin said a swedish dc3 plane that disappeared over soviet 
territory in 1952 was equipped with sophisticated us 
reconnaissance equipment the americans had supplied in exchange for 
intellegence information 
edin who is retired worked as a monitor at the radio institute 
of the swedish armed forces fra from 1948 to 1956 
parts of the swedish defense especially the fra have had 
farreaching cooperation with nato since the alliance was formed at 
the end of the 1940s edin said in an article signed by him and 
published by the dagens nyheter newspaper he provided no further 
examples 
evert dahlen a spokesman for the armed forces chief of staff 
said such cooperation would have required government approval and 
that he was unaware of any such agreement 
we never comment on how our intelligence works he added 
the dc3 and its crew were never recovered the incident became 
known as the catalina affair after the soviets shot down a swedish 
air force catalina aircraft searching for the missing plane 
the dc3 was believed to have been shot down by the soviets over 
the baltic sea but edin said he thought the plane was forced to 
land in the soviet union and the equipment seized

us marine commandant 
gen alfred gray told his men wednesday to dig in for a long stay 
in the saudi desert and to stop asking when they would be going 
home 
he also reminded them that if they are attacked the best 
defense is a good offense 
gray delivered a 45minute pep talk to marines at a combat 
support detachment not far from the persian gulf and the 
northsouth highways the corps is straddling to protect vital saudi 
oil installations 
he told the men he hoped to be able to stick to the policy of 
limiting major deployments to six months but gray known for his 
bluntness said the tense standoff and logistical problems might 
prevent normal rotations and he didnt expect any whining 
i dont want to hear about any more questions about how long 
youre going to be here he told about 200 marines gathered 
around him at the camp named in honor of joe foss a world war ii 
marine flying ace who later was governor of south dakota and 
chairman of the national rifle association 
how long are we going to be here he asked rhetorically 
through a bullhorn well were going to be here as long as it 
takes to get done what has to be done 
there will be no morale problems because i say there will 
be morale there will also be no boredom 
he described the marines mission as defensive but said the 
usled multinational forces deployed after iraq invaded kuwait 
were gaining more power every day and have everything we need to 
do whatever needs to be done 
gray solemnly reminded his troops that marines are always in 
this part of the world the no 1 target of terrorist attacks 
more than 240 marines were killed by a suicide truck bomber who 
blew up their barracks in beirut in october 1983 the marines were 
in lebanon as part of a multinational peacekeeping force 
gray told the troops there were 13 ships headed to the gulf 
region with supplies to sustain their deployment in the northern 
saudi desert 
you and the rest of your warrior friends youre really on the 
point youre the tip of the spear he said 
for now gray said the mission was defense but he suggested the 
marines would quickly go on offense if iraqi forces attacked 
we all know the best defense is a good offense he said 
we have a very very powerful flexible and most useful force 
afloat and ashore ready to do whatever needs to be done were 
going to play for keeps if that is required 
he told the men not to underestimate iraqs large army which 
fought an allout war with the iranians from 1980 to 1988 
we face the potential of a pretty good firefight gray said 
gray also said he believed the swift american response to 
saddams aug 2 invasion of kuwait had prevented the iraqis from 
moving into saudi arabia 
youve won a big one already and you havent had to fire a 
shot he said and nobodys had to get patched up

sen mark hatfields democratic opponent is 
trying to revive his struggling campaign by attacking the oregon 
senators top aide for potential conflicts of interest 
democrat harry lonsdale is making an issue of the aides 
activities as he attempts to paint hatfield as a friend of special 
interests and big business especially the northwests timber 
industry 
hatfields integrity may have been compromised because his 
administrative assistant gerald frank sat on the board of a 
failed savings and loan and made more than 50 trips to new york 
over four years at the senates expense the lonsdale campaign 
suggested frank also holds stock in at least three timber 
companies lonsdale aides said 
frank and hatfield deny there has been any conflict of interest 
or improper use of senate finances 
what people are forgetting is that it is not gerry frank on 
the ballot im on the ballot lets talk about me said 
hatfield the ranking republican on the senate appropriations 
committee he was first elected in 1966 
at the very least it gives the appearance of a conflict of 
interest said dan walter lonsdales campaign manager 
it illustrates how pervasive special interest and big business 
is i dont think it is healthy for the public interest when those 
interests are so intertwined it looks like the goodoldboy 
network is very much alive and well walter said 
frank whose prominence in oregon has led some to call him 
oregons third senator has worked for hatfield for 23 years 
lonsdales agenda is to somehow discredit senator hatfield by 
somehow discrediting me said frank 
this was planted with media outlets by the lonsdale people 
and they have admitted it frank said everything has been a 
matter of public record filed with the senate in disclosure 
forms 
bill calder hatfields press secretary said lonsdales effort 
will backfire because he is diverting attention from the 
issues 
frank 67 a millionaire whose family founded the northwests 
largest department store chain said he never tried to influence 
hatfield regarding any savings and loan institutions 
frank said he served on the board of salems american federal 
savings and loan from 1962 to 1987 because he wanted to make 
inexpensive housing available in the region 
it was a family operation frank said when we got into 
things other than providing home mortgages investing in arizona 
and texs i raised questions of unhappiness with the management of 
the outfit i had my fill and quit in 1987 
lonsdale said earlier this month that he was not sure that 
hatfield had been influenced in regard to sampls but his chief of 
staff has been very deeply involved himself in sampls so i think 
that it might have been very easy for mark hatfield to become 
complacent about how the sampl bailout was handled he trailed 
hatfield by a 63 percent to 27 percent margin in an august poll 
the man was on the board of a savings and loan while his boss 
was voting on banking and sampl regulation said walter 
frank who lives in oregon and makes frequent trips to 
washington said he has never traveled for personal purposes at 
senate expense he said he frequently flew out of los angeles and 
new york because the crosscountry flights were cheaper than 
similar flights between portland and washington dc 
frank who publishes an annual travel guide to new york city 
that has earned him more than 1 million said he used personal 
finances to cover every penny of travel related to work on the 
travel guide 
calder said all of the senatepaid expenses were approved by the 
senate dispersing office and senate rules committee 
frank said hired investors buy and sell his stocks and he was 
not aware that he had any holdings in timber companies he said he 
has never used his position to try to influence hatfield regarding 
any private interests

its three stories of concrete and junk it 
weighs 60 tons and pigeons call it home but is it art 
the owner of the mall in suburban berwyn where big bilbored 
has stood for a decade still gets angry letters demanding that he 
tear down the 25000 sculpture 
they get real mad at me i get letters saying if you like it 
so much why isnt it in your yard owner david bermant said 
tuesday 
the project symbolizes americas throwaway society said the 
sculptor nancy rubins small appliances and other scrap are 
embedded in the concrete structure 
even big bilboreds defenders dont like it but they say 
bermant has the right to display his art on his property 
its tacky but if you consider the tastelessness of berwyn 
it fits with joe sixpack grunting from bar to bar said 
resident john moisant 
bermant hired the gallup organization earlier this month to find 
out if a majority of shoppers at suburban berwyns cermak plaza 
shopping center think big bilbored should stay or go 
if big bilbored comes down something even wilder will 
replace it bermant promises 
few malls look anything like cermak plaza located at one of the 
citys busiest intersections bermant has installed 30 pieces 
around the outdoor center including spindle a stack of cars 
impaled on a huge spike in the parking lot and pinto pelt in 
which an artist removed the bodywork from an old ford pinto and 
bolted it to the outside of a building 
bermant wants to put sculptures where they will be seen and give 
his shopping centers some individuality he has installed 
sculptures at five of the 20 centers he has owned across the 
country 
what makes it any different from any other shopping center 
ive got the same crappy merchants selling the same crappy stuff

the allwhite pretoria city 
council ended a 12hour cut in electricity to two black townships 
today 
power had been cut to the townships of mamelodi and 
atteridgeville at 4 am because residents have refused to pay 
their bills for three months the council said electrical service 
resumed at about 420 pm 
township leaders met with pretoria officials today to try to 
work out a solution a joint statement issued after the meeting 
said the city council was convinced an agreement could be reached 
and agreed to temporarily restore power it said the outstanding 
bills must be paid 
residents owe about 2 million in overdue electricity bills 
according to the council which s controlled by president fw de 
klerks national party 
blacks living in the mamelodi and atteridgeville townships have 
withheld payments to protest what they say are high fees and poor 
services some 600000 blacks live in the townships on the edge of 
pretoria the capital 
the electricity cut shuts down light towers in the townships and 
household appliances such as lamps refrigerators and stoves the 
resulting darkness at night could increase street crime although 
police have bolstered patrols to try to maintain order no 
incidents were reported today 
brian currin director of the lawyers for human rights said 
township residents planned legal action against the city council 
for its provocative and politically irresponsible decision to 
cut power 
a civic leader later said lawyers were asked to delay any 
action 
several whitesonly city councils have cut electricity recently 
to neighboring black townships after residents refused to pay their 
bills to protest services however the electricity has been 
restored within a day or two following negotiations between the two 
sides 
in other developments police launched a homicide investigation 
into the deaths of seven people whose bodies were found monday 
along railroad tracks between johannesburg and the soweto black 
township 
police col frans malherbe said the deaths occurred during a 
panic created by a false alarm that the train was under attack he 
said criminal elements spread the attack rumor to steal 
passengers belongings in the confusion 
people who go about raising these false alarms will almost 
certainly be charged with culpable homicide he said 
attacks on trains in the johannesburg area have killed more than 
two dozen people in recent weeks 
police said today there were no reports of trouble during the 
first night of a 9 pm4 am curfew imposed to stop violence in 
black townships around johannesburg 
about 800 blacks have died since fighting began outside 
johannesburg in early august between the african national congress 
and inkatha both organizations oppose apartheid but differ on 
tactics and plans for a future south africa

an earthquake shook parts of illinois 
kentucky arkansas missouri tennessee and indiana this morning 
but no major damage was reported 
the quake was felt at at 819 am cdt it registered 46 on the 
richter scale and was centered along the new madrid fault 40 miles 
north of new madrid mo according to don kelly a spokesman for 
the us geological survey in reston va 
new madrid has been the site of some of the greatest earthquakes 
in us history the new madrid fault line runs from marked tree 
ark to southern illinois and has hundreds of small quakes every 
year 
although there were no accounts of damage the temblor rattled 
nerves throughout the region which has been on edge about 
predictions of a major quake 
kenneth rutledge who lives 16 miles east of hopkinsville ky 
said he was sitting in his living room when the quake hit 
im telling you it moved me he said 
leonard nash who was visiting a farm in piggott in northeastern 
arkansas said you could feel it and hear things moving in the 
house it lasted just a few seconds 
it didnt excite us too much it wasnt anything that was that 
frightening we just looked at each other said hey that was an 
earthquake and continued our talking 
scott chambers the director of emergency medical services in 
corning ark said he felt the temblor at the local hospital 
it was about like standing real close to a train track when a 
train comes by a little harder than that he said 
three or four cataclysmic earthquakes struck the new madrid 
fault in the winter of 181112 and were felt as far away as boston 
they have been estimated at about 8 on the richter scale which 
didnt exist at the time 
there have been predictions that an earthquake is likely along 
the new madrid fault before the end of the century recently a 
scientist in new mexico predicted that a major quake could occur in 
early december prompting increases in insurance sales and other 
preparatory measures 
other experts dispute his theory of a tidal trigger to 
earthquakes but say a major quake in the region is bound to happen 
eventually 
i dont think this is a precursor to a larger event elaine 
foust of the us geological survey in nashville said today but 
we could flip a coin and decide im not god i cant predict 
cecil whaley operations officer for the tennessee emergency 
management agency in nashville also poohpoohed the fivesecond 
shake 
people who live on solid rock probably did not feel it 
whaley said this appears to be normal we have small ones 
two or three times a week usually imperceptible 
in indiana a dispatcher said the evansville police department 
had received about 60 calls from concerned citizens shortly after 
the quake but had received no reports of damage 
dan moran felt the quake at the evansville museum of arts and 
sciences which is featuring an earthquake exhibit this fall 
maybe this will help grab peoples attention again about the 
inevitability of earthquakes moran said 
the richter scale is a gauge of the energy released by an 
earthquake as mesured by the ground motion recorded on a 
seismograph 
every increase of one number say from magnitude 55 to 
magnitude 65 means that the ground motion is 10 times greater 
some experts say the actual amount of energy released may be 30 
times greater a quake of magnitude 4 can cause moderate damage a 
quake of magnitude 5 is capable of considerable damage 
last octobers earthquake in san francisco registered 71

president bush stumping today for 
republicans in the midwest blasted democrats in one breath and 
profusely thanked them in the next 
the president said bipartisanship is of the utmost importance as 
he seeks support for his persian gulf policies and the massive us 
military buildup in saudi arabia 
im grateful to the democratic leadership for the support they 
have given he told a fundraising luncheon for gubernatorial 
candidate george voinovich we need to continue to maintain a 
bipartisan spirit in support of americas response to iraqi 
aggression he said 
he reiterated his feeling that politics should stop at the 
waters edge when it comes to an international crisis 
the words were similar to what bush has said many times since 
iraqs aug 2 invasion of kuwait but they contrasted sharply with 
the blistering attack he had leveled against democrats a moment 
before when he talked about the budget negotiations 
acknowledging that emotions in this budget debate are 
running high bush launched into a tirade against democrats in 
congress who he accused of blocking an agreement to reduce the 
deficit 
with monday looming as the deadline to reach a deficit reduction 
agreement bush said that if failure to meet the deadline results 
in automatic spending cuts the democrats will be to blame for the 
havoc that ensues including massive government furloughs and 
disruptions of services 
he insisted that it is not his demand for a capital gains 
reduction tax that is holding up the process before leaving 
washington bush met with republican congressional leaders who said 
the president may be willing to compromise on his call for a cut in 
the capital gains tax 
contrary to what you may have heard the hangup is not capital 
gains bush said the hangup is with the democrats on capitol 
hill 
it goes well beyond political rhetoric he said it is 
important to get a solution he said 
on the political front bush gave voinovich a resounding 
endorsement as the candidate who would promote education and law 
and order and environmental protection 
as mayor of cleveland voinovich had taken the city from the 
gloomy dark days of despair and brought it into brighter times 
bush said 
recent polls have shown voinovich with a slight lead over the 
democratic nominee state attorney general anthony j celebrezze 
jr in the race to succeed democratic gov richard celeste 
the gubernatorial battle is one of several that is being hotly 
contested by both parties as the reapportionment of congressional 
districts looms 
from akron today bush was heading to illinois for a dinner 
honoring gop senate candidate rep lynn martin who is in an uphill 
battle against democratic sen paul simon 
the president was spending tonight in minneapolis where he will 
attend a breakfast thursday to benefit the gubernatorial bid of 
political newcomer jon grunseth grunseth a st paul businessman 
won a sixway independentrepublican primary this month to face 
incumbent gov rudy perpich 
bush will return to ohio on thursday for a reception and lunch 
to benefit voinovich in cleveland then he will head to detroit to 
stump for gop senate hopeful rep bill schuette who is trying to 
oust democratic sen carl levin 
as the november election nears the president is committing one 
to three days each week with larger blocks of time expected at the 
end to help gop candidates 
he has used the trips as well to rally support for his huge 
military deployment in the persian gulf

durable goods orders to us manufacturers 
slid 08 percent in august according to a government report 
wednesday that analysts said indicated cutbacks in business 
investment plans because of middle east uncertainties 
the commerce department reported that orders for durable goods 
bigticket items expected to last more than three years 
totaled a seasonally adjusted 127 billion after a revised 27 
percent gain in july 
analysts pointed to a 112 percent drop to 354 billion in 
nondefense capital goods orders which often are a barometer of 
business plans to expand and modernize 
on the surface it seems to suggest that producers are wary 
about the economic outlook said gilbert benz an economist with 
the swiss bank corp in new york theres no way that 
producer investment wont be affected by oil prices particularly 
if they stay above 35 a barrel 
since the aug 2 iraqi invasion of kuwait oil prices have 
soared from less than 15 a barrel to nearly 40 a barrel the 
price shock has further weakened an already sluggish economy that 
some economists say is slipping into recession 
in fact economist gordon richards of the national association 
of manufacturers said the durable goods report provides further 
confirmation that the recession began in august the start of the 
recession was already in evidence due to falling retail sales and 
industrial production 
william k macreynolds forecasting director for the us 
chamber of commerce said the decline in both new and unfilled 
orders means the economy will fall into a recession in the fourth 
quarter 
michael k evans of evans economics inc in washington was not 
as pessimistic pointing to another commerce department report 
wednesday that showed august consumer spending up 05 percent from 
july while june and july figures were even stronger than first 
reported 
it appeared that spending appeared to be recovering in june 
and the oil shock didnt make that much of a dent in it evans 
said 
consumer spending represents about twothirds of the nations 
economic activity the report also said personal incomes grew 03 
percent in august 
evans also noted the decline in some durable goods order 
categories was partially offset by a big surge in defense orders 
and that was no surprise given whats going on in the middle 
east 
defense orders which often are volatile jumped 124 percent to 
84 billion after a 56 percent decline in july 
my guess is that almost all of that was due to the persian 
gulf evans said excluding the defense category orders fell 16 
percent 
both electrical machinery and transportation categories posted 
gains while nonelectrical machinery and primary metals orders 
fell 
orders for transportation equipment rose 13 percent to 352 
billion mostly for motor vehicles aircraft orders fell about 3 
billion excluding the transportation category durable goods 
orders fell 16 percent transportation orders jumped 45 percent 
in july 
electrical machinery orders advanced 26 percent to 208 
billion after a 15 percent gain a month earlier 
but nonelectrical machinery orders fell 61 percent to 212 
billion after gaining 35 percent in july and orders for primary 
metals slipped 17 percent to 116 billion after rising 28 
percent the previous month 
shipments of durable goods rose 29 percent to 1287 billion 
in august most of which was motor vehicles shipments had fallen 
18 percent in july 
unfilled orders edged down 03 percent to 4993 billion after 
gaining 06 percent a month earlier

the sting of death a movie from japan 
featured in the new york film festival is a spare tale of betrayal 
how a husbands infidelity permanently stains his wifes soul 
with grief and jealousy 
director kohei oguris opens his film with miho a homemaker and 
mother of two and her husband toshio once a kamakazi pilot and 
now a writer calmly discussing the consequences of his affair 
hey do you really want to die he asks 
keep your heys for someone else who do you think i am 
how do you want me to call you 
have you no shame at all call me dear 
this verbal chest thwacking goes back and forth until toshio 
defines what miho is to him you are my wife 
but miho is so deeply disturbed by her husbands former mistress 
that her rage begins to feed upon itself and begets more hatred 
until she is consumed by this obsessive selfdestruction 
the fire soon engulfs toshio too and together they complete a 
destructive circle an iron pot is pressing my head hard hit 
me miho pleads 
toshio obediently complies 
in an attempt to redeem himself he offers her complete 
servitude and fidelity he tells her that since he tormented her 
for 10 years with his affair he will be her slave for the next 10 
she accepts this pact for a while but soon is undone by the 
recurring jealousy of the other woman she sells her kimonos hires 
a private detective and discovers the sordid secrets of her 
husbands philanderings he bought the other woman underwear gave 
her candy paid for an abortion 
back and forth the couple struggles between saving their 
marriage and resigning themselves to the pain and emptiness before 
them 
he becomes the picture of contrition offering her effusive 
apologies and begging for forgiveness ive thought only of 
myself after the war he confesses 
at times miho seems to have exorcised the ghost of the other 
woman and a semblance of domestic normalcy prevails 
then seemingly from nowhere she blurts out over dinner that 
she wants her husband to forever call her by the name of his 
mistress 
one of their two children who somehow seem oblivious to the 
suffering of their parents tells dad he might as well do as mom 
says 
this pyschological unraveling forms the bulk of this bleak 
story and director oguri said at a news conference after a press 
screening tuesday that he hopes it offers a parable of finding 
faith in the face of adversity 
on the surface it is a crisis of a marriage he said through 
a translator underneath it is a crisis of returning to 
humanity which leads you to the idea of prayer and the 
accomplishment of faith 
the sting of death is marked by its austerity the camera 
rarely leaves the four walls of the home and most sets are drenched 
in soft shades of gray its also a quiet film ambient noise seems 
to have been edited out so the only sounds we hear is the exchange 
of dialogue 
oguri leaves his tale of the broken hearts and souls open 
without resolving if miho and toshio remain together or if they 
part either by death or divorce 
asked to speculate on their future oguri says he would like to 
think they would have become happy 
the 28th new york film festival opened sept 21 with joel and 
ethan coens quirky gangster movie millers crossing the

fbi director william s sessions on wednesday 
reaffirmed his support of the bureaus undercover tactics 
including the sting operation which videotaped washington mayor 
marion barry smoking crack cocaine 
but sessions acknowledged that a jurys refusal to convict barry 
of the charge arising from that sting may have underscored the 
need to be very careful and look very carefully before you elect 
to use a particular technique 
the fbi did exercise such caution before it used a former 
girlfriend of barrys to lure the mayor to a downtown hotel where 
he smoked crack in front of a hidden video camera the director 
insisted 
sessions also backed the fbis use of undercover operations to 
catch people in the act of other misdeeds as in the abscam 
corruption investigation of a decade ago that case netted 
convictions of seven members of congress 
when we gather evidence it is not always simply a matter of 
walking up and asking the farmer if his eggs are fresh sessions 
said there are things you do that will be available to use for 
evidence in the course of a trial 
for the techniques in abscam i would not apologize nor do i 
feel they were inappropriate sessions said nor do i feel the 
techniques that were utilized in the case at hand were 
inappropriate 
the videotapes of barry smoking crack were not suppressed 
under the law they were allowed by the court they were available 
to the jury and it did what it wanted to do with it which is the 
genius of our system sessions said 
if they rejected that on account of that technique then of 
course that is a price the government ultimately paid sessions 
said of the jurys verdict 
jurors deadlocked on 12 counts against barry including a 
cocaine possession charge arising from his jan 18 arrest at the 
vista hotel barry was convicted of one misdemeanor cocaine 
possession count and is scheduled to be sentenced oct 26 he was 
acquitted of another misdemeanor possession charge 
prosecutors decided not to retry barry on the remaining counts 
including three perjury charges that the mayor lied to a grand jury 
by denying that he had used cocaine 
sessions said the verdicts message about fbi undercover 
investigations of elected public officials could take many 
forms 
it could be everything from a strong affirmation to a caution 
that you need to be careful and look carefully before you elect 
to use as particular technique 
and that was done in that case sessions said 
on other subjects the director said 
his health is excellent in the wake of surgery last june for a 
medical condition he refused to disclose sessions acknowledged 
that he is periodically tested for skin cancer that was removed 
from his back in 1985 
i am in good health i continue to be in good health i am not 
worried about my health and i would hope that will actually turn 
out and continue to be true sessions said 
the fbi had no indication of iraqisponsored terrorism since 
iraqs invasion of kuwait last month sessions said the bureau is 
on high alert against any possible terrorist acts and we are of 
course hopeful we would be able to avert and avoid any terrorist 
act itself

us marines on wednesday flew 
emergency food and medical supplies into the capital where pet 
lions of slain president samuel doe reportedly were preying on 
starving people inside his mansion 
a ceasefire between four armies in monrovia held for the fifth 
day although gunshots crackled occasionally 
the daily mail newspaper of neighboring freetown sierra leone 
quoted one of does generals as saying two hungry pet lions of the 
ousted leader were prowling around the presidential residence in 
monrovia eating people weakened by hunger many people sought 
refuge in the mansion during the height of the fighting among rebel 
factions and does soldiers 
the stateowned newspaper quoted gen henry chibli said the 
lions normally ate 275 pounds of meat a day but that doe had been 
unable to provide them with food in his last days 
maj chris otulana a spokesman for a fivenation west african 
army sent to enforce a truce in liberias 9monthold civilwwar 
appealed for more international aid to stop people from dying of 
hunger and disease 
the marine helicopters carried 13 tons of emergency food and 
medical equipment from freetown to monrovia the supplies belong to 
the belgian chapter of doctors without borders which plans to 
reopen a field hospital in the city 
the belgian doctors were forced to close their operations last 
month when rebel leader charles taylor advanced into the capital 
and the hospital was hit by rockets and shells 
otulana urged taylor to open talks with the west african task 
force so we can jaw jaw rather than war war he spoke in an 
interview with the associated press 
taylor has demanded the withdrawal of the west africans whom he 
accuses of wanting to install a puppet government in liberia 
he has declared himself president and is trying to install his 
own government he said he will hold elections on oct 10 to choose 
a representative from each of liberias 13 counties to join the 
government which he has described as a temporary administration 
that would organize general elections 
the west african plan also proposes elections but says they 
should be organized by an interim government already chosen by 
liberian opposition parties businessmen and clergymen 
taylors aides had reported he was to meet tuesday with brig 
gen david nimley commander of the remnants of does army but no 
meeting took place according to the french news agency agence 
francepresse 
taylor has made no contact with the west african force or those 
of rival rebel leader prince johnson 
johnson and nimley have agreed to the west african peace plan 
johnson has said taylor has no right to call his own elections and 
that his proposal is unrealistic given the warravaged state of the 
nation 
taylor started the civil war on dec 24 when he invadd from 
neighboring ivory coast johnson fought alongside him but formed 
his own rebel faction after the two quarreled johnsons forces 
captured doe earlier this month and tortured him to death 
more than 5000 civilians have been killed in the fighting more 
than half a million liberians have fled to neighboring states and 
at least another million of the 23 million population is displaced 
within the country 
monrovia has been without electricity running water and 
telephone communications for three months few food supplies have 
reached the capital

the 108yearold evening express will 
close in february the publisher said 
the merger with the morning portland press herald will take 
effect feb 4 said the guy gannett publishing co 
while were very proud of the evening express changing 
lifestyles have for the past decade caused an increased 
readership of morning newspapers and a corresponding decrease of 
evening circulation said jean gannett hawley publisher of the 
portland press herald and the evening express 
the merger of our two daily newspapers will result in the 
creation of a single paper with more resources and standards of 
quality journalism for mainers hawley said in a statement 
tuesday 
the express had been losing circulation steadily since the early 
1980s its daily circulation now stands at between 22000 and 
23000 
the closing will leave maine with only two afternoon dailies 
the journal tribune in biddeford and the times record in brunswick 
both of which compete with the press herald for readers 
the new press herald will continue to publish monday through 
saturday mornings and include many of the features now contained in 
the evening express along with additional local news the company 
also publishes the maine sunday telegram 
the merger will leave the company with 30 fewer positions but 
the company said it might not have to lay off any employees because 
it had held open vacancies this year and is providing an early 
retirement incentive package 
by taking this action we believe we will be a better 
newspaper for our readers who will get more features and local news 
and our advertisers for whom our circulation will be 
unduplicated steve braver the companys general manager said 
in a statement to employees 
when founded in 1882 by pembroke native arthur wood laughlin 
the express was one of four portland dailies and billed itself as 
the only onecent paper in the state 
five years later the express was taken over by a company headed 
by col frederick neal dow son of staunch prohibitionist neal dow 
whose views were reflected in the newspaper 
dow acquired a competing afternoon paper the daily advertiser 
in 1910 and merged it with the express which by then had the 
largest circulation in the city 
in the 1920s guy p gannett acquired and consolidated the 
citys major daily and sunday papers turning them into the crown 
jewel of a media empire that now includes dailies in waterville and 
augusta a chain of weeklies in minnesota and television and radio 
stations 
after forming the press herald out of the daily press and the 
successor to the old eastern argus gannett bought the express from 
the dow family in 1925 
the express circulation peaked at about 31000 in the late 
1970s 
the closing of the express reflects an industry trend toward 
declining circulation among many afternoon dailies across the 
country that have been struggling in a time of changing lifestyles 
and growing competition from television news

question no 5 on one exam wednesday 
for women civil defense volunteers was if you inhale gas from a 
chemical weapon will it cause burns in the throat 
more than 5000 women completed their first two weeks of 
training on a first aid and civil defense course many view as the 
first step in changing the role of saudi women forever in the 
strict moslem society 
but training women in a profession that requires not just seeing 
but touching strangers is a highly sensitive issue in a country 
where women are not allowed to drive and always wear black 
headscarves and long black cloaks in public 
the changes are being made in response to iraqs invasion aug 2 
of neighboring kuwait and the saudi monarchys call for western 
forces to help defend the kingdom 
i feel now i have more of a role in society said mirvat 
mohammed 25 a computer programmer who took the course if it 
war happens im ready 
after the government announced in early september that women 
volunteers would be accepted for civil defense training the health 
ministry revamped its basic 10hour first aid course with a war 
against iraqs saddam hussein in mind 
his arsenal of chemical weapons meant adding four hours of 
lectures on the issue ranging from how to seal your windows to 
how to diagnose and treat chemical wounds 
the 20hour course also concentrated on wounds caused by guns 
said dr ronda flemban a surgeon who taught seven groups of women 
at the ministrys health institute in jiddah a western port 
those trained can use the basic first aid at home but will be 
called upon in time of war to act as nursing assistants 
most people dont know how to act during an emergency dr 
flemban said as we are expecting anything could happen most 
people need to know first aid 
women taking the course included housewives teachers students 
and government employees 
amal fatani 35 who graduated from george washington university 
in economics in 1985 signed up because she could not answer her 
childrens questions about chemical weapons 
daughter tughreed 9 and son faris 4 were very very 
afraid she said 
they asked me what it looked like what would happen if we 
closed the doors and windows this course will give me the chance 
to give the right answers 
those that did well on the 26 questions wednesday such as 
answering yes that inhaling chemical weapons can burn your throat 
will get the chance to sign up for a threemonth threehour a day 
intensive course 
the government expects the response to be huge especially 
because more than 13300 are signed up for the next twoweek class 
that starts saturday hundreds are taking similar course at private 
institutions 
many women said saudi arabia was illprepared for an emergency 
but the threat from iraq would change that 
in a society where men and women are educated separately and 
rarely mingle in public the call for women volunteers was viewed 
as a major social change 
there will be more exposure of women within the tenets of 
islam one newspaper editor said speaking on condition of 
anonymity the government would like to tap that vast resource 
leila barzangi director of the health institute said our 
religion has always allowed and encouraged women to work as nurses 
and doctors but our traditions prevented it 
tradition dictated the institutes hallways be virtually cleared 
of women before the front door was opened for a visiting male 
reporter 
greeted by a woman with only her eyes showing he was told to 
stay away from a window that looked onto the interior of the 
building 
its a sensitive subject because of the religious people 
zahrani said 
women pointing out that men and women work sidebyside in 
hospitals said this segregation would disappear instantly in event 
of a crisis 
during a disaster no one will even think about it dr 
flemban said 
women would probably not alter their islamic dress but a crisis 
might put a saudi woman behind the wheel of an ambulance

the decision by the united nations to 
extend its trade embargo against iraq to air traffic amounts to 
an act of war the baghdad government says 
thirteen of the security councils 15 members were represented 
by foreign ministers during tuesdays nearly unanimous vote giving 
the resolution added symbolic weight 
the council warned the baghdad government of further punitive 
action and hinted at sanctions against nations that fail to honor 
the un embargo on trade with iraq cuba cast the only no vote 
jordan criticized for assisting iraq by allowing some food and 
supplies to cross into that country announced today that it would 
comply with the un air embargo against iraq and halt all mercy 
flights of foreign nationals from iraq and kuwait 
foreign minister marwan kasim said in a statement that jordan 
would comply with the air embargo security council resolution 670 
kasim who also is the deputy prime minister said jordan has 
continued to allow a minimum number of flights by the iraqi 
airways due to humanitarian considerations facilitating the 
movement of foreign nationals from iraq and kuwait he said 
however those flights will now be terminated in accordance 
with security council resolution 670 he said 
in addition to sanctioning the air embargo the resolution calls 
for halting iraqi shipping and freezing iraqi assets overseas 
both secretary of state james a baker iii and soviet foreign 
minister eduard shevardnadze suggested the united nations could 
take military action if all other efforts to force iraq into 
relinquishing kuwait fail 
war is not a desirable option but it is one of the options 
contained in the un charter said shevardnadze anyway i 
hope that peaceful ways will be found to find a way out 
in a speech to the general assembly earlier he called iraqs 
seizure of kuwait a major affront to mankind the united 
nations has the power to suppress acts of aggression there is 
ample evidence that this right can be exercised it will be if the 
illegal occupation of kuwait continues 
baker struck a similar note 
the charter envisages the possibility of further individual 
and collective measures to defend against aggression and flagrant 
violations of international humanitarian law he said 
the number of foreign ministers attending the security council 
vote underscored the determination of the international community 
to compel iraq to quit kuwait which iraqs saddam hussein had his 
army seize on aug 2 
shevardnadze told the general assembly that people like saddam 
who take hostages on a mass scale threaten other nations with 
destruction and are guilty of particular ruthlessness in the use 
of force should be tried by an international tribunal for their 
crime against humanity 
since it invaded kuwait iraq has refused to release several 
thousand western men and moved some of them to potential military 
targets for use as human shields against possible attack 
shevardnadze was just one among a string of presidents foreign 
ministers and prime ministers who have demanded an immediate iraqi 
pullout in speeches to the 45th general assembly which began its 
general debate on monday 
the foreign ministers of britain west germany portugal 
canada belgium the netherlands luxembourg and spain were due to 
give speeches today 
the new security council resolution calls on all states to bar 
from their airspace all passenger and cargo flights to or from iraq 
and occupied kuwait 
only unapproved shipments of humanitarian food aid or 
medicine are permitted 
iraqs ambassador abdul alanbari stalked out of the security 
council session after vote saying you know boycotting a country 
by enforcing a naval embargo as well as an air embargo is an act of 
aggression an act of war 
but up to now we have been practicing selfrestraint because 
we know that if war were to break out it would destroy everything 
in the region he said 
the resolution the ninth passed by the security council in an 
effort to force iraq to quit kuwait prohibits use of force in the 
air embargo but calls for searches and detention of aircraft 
the council warned that it would consider serious action if 
iraq continued to flout the will of the international community 
hinting at a un military operation it said countries that try to 
evade the embargo may themselves face secondary sanctions 
un spokesman francois giuliani said it was the first time in 
the 45year history of the united nations that so many foreign 
ministers had attended a meeting to vote on a substantive issue 
on only three previous occasions have the foreign ministers of 
all five permanent members the united states the soviet union 
britain china and france attended a security council meeting 
rarely has the international community been so united and 
determined that aggression should not succeed baker told the 
council 
iraq has been quarantined because its brutal actions have 
separated it from the community of nations there can be no 
business as usual in fact there can be no economic exchanges with 
iraq at all he said 
cuba which was on the receiving end of a us blockade during 
the 1962 missile crisis has said it is against any sanctions on 
iraq 
earlier resolutions aimed at iraq authorized ships to implement 
a maritime embargo and to stop and search vessels that may be 
violating trade sanctions they also repudiated the annexation of 
kuwait demanded the release of hostages and condemned iraqi raids 
on foreign missions in kuwait

a nationwide program to recognize outstanding 
farm conservationists was announced wednesday by agriculture 
secretary clayton yeutter 
the new take pride in america farm conservation program will 
honor an outstanding farmer in each of nearly 3000 soil and water 
conservation districts during a threeyear period 
yeutter made the announcement in amana iowa where he appeared 
with officials of goodyear tire and rubber the national 
association of conservation districts and the national association 
of state conservation agencies cosponsors of the awards program 
the agriculture department also will step up efforts to improve 
the nations water quality he said 
an objective will be to reduce the risk of agricultural chemical 
pollution of ground and surface water yeutter said in prepared 
remarks released here 
the program was described by yeutter as designed to improve 
coordination among usdas broad array of water quality programs 
and encourage voluntary adoption of agricultural practices to 
improve and protect water supplies 
as part of the plan yeutter said the department will put soil 
conservation service and extension employees from all county 
offices through an intensive training course in methods of 
preserving water quality 
also he said many usda field guides are being rewritten to 
help farmers keep agricultural chemicals out of the water 
yeutter as he has been doing recently criticized congress for 
including higher price supports in farm bills passed by the house 
and senate conferees are trying to work out differences 
but yeutter has been complaining that some of the 
marketoriented policies and flexibility of the 1985 law have been 
abandoned or altered in ways that could hurt farmers in the long 
run 
though congress is trying to label this new legislation as 
being farmerfriendly it looks to us and to americas farmers 
more like nightmare on elm street part ii where the heart of 
americas farm economy could once again be handed to our 
competitors on a silver platter he said

capital raising questions about jordans support for a new un 
air embargo against iraq baghdad criticized washington and moscow 
for their role in the un crackdown 
the iraqi planes landing in amman carried passengers and it was 
not known what their cargo holds contained the planes all returned 
to baghdad 
but jordan later today announced it would abide by the un 
embargo and halt all mercy flights of foreign nationals from iraq 
and kuwait 
foreign minister marwan kasim said in a statement at the united 
nations jordan has continued to allow a minimum number of 
flights by the iraqi airways due to humanitarian considerations 
facilitating the movement of foreign nationals from iraq and 
kuwait 
however those flights will now be terminated in accordance 
with security council resolution 670 said kasim who also is 
deputy prime minister 
in another development a us carrierbased helicopter carrying 
17 sailors was forced to make an emergency landing this morning in 
the red sea the navy said the sailors were all rescued unharmed 
the sh3h sea king helicopter landed about 5000 yards from the 
uss john f kennedy the navy said in a statement 
the antisubmarine chopper was on a routine training mission 
the navy said such copters are sometimes used for minesweeping 
runs but the statement did not identify the training mission and 
navy officials were not immediately available for comment 
earlier today jordan said iraqi passenger aircraft were not 
included in the resolution approved tuesday by the un security 
council a jordanian cabinet minister said inspections of the iraqi 
aircraft began with the third flight today and a senior aviation 
official said the un or other officials were free to check the 
iraqi cargo holds 
the un resolution does not mention passenger planes but says 
that all planes traveling to and from iraq should be checked to 
make sure they are not carrying cargo prohibited by the un trade 
sanctions the resolution prohibits the use of force to stop 
planes but allows for the detention of aircraft 
the world body in its ninth resolution against iraq since the 
invasion of kuwait on aug 2 also reaffirmed its embargo against 
iraqi shipping and the freezing of iraqi assets overseas to try to 
force iraq to withdraw 
the united states and soviet union both indicated un military 
action could be in store unless iraq pulls out war is not a 
desirable option but it is one of the options contained in the 
un charter soviet foreign minister eduard shevardnadze told 
the world body on tuesday 
iraqs ambassador abdul alanbari called the un actions an 
act of war the official iraq news agency today accused the 
soviet union a former ally of being bribed by the united states 
and gulf sheiks 
we tell shevardnadze if you are not concerned about the 
relations of friendship with the arabs and want to be dragged into 
the alliance of american hostility then the arabs will not be 
concerned about the likes of you the news agency said 
baghdad radio denounced the air embargo today and said it was 
imposed on the directives of the hostile policy of president 
bush 
iraqi officials today announced more food rationing starting 
this weekend because of the un embargo trade and finance 
minister mohammed mahdi saleh said the rationing will include rice 
flour cooking oil sugar and tea 
the lack of prospects for resolution of the nearly 8weekold 
crisis led to a 475 percent fall this morning on the tokyo stock 
exchange which has dropped 28 percent since iraqs invasion 
oil prices which have nearly doubled following the invasion 
were trading lower on the new york futures market this morning 
with light sweet crude down 28 cents to 3725 per barrel on 
contracts for november delivery 
defense secretary dick cheney said today there is an increasing 
likelihood that iraqi president saddam hussein will lash out with 
military force to try to break the un embargo 
we may have seen in the last 48 or 72 hours the beginning 
commentary from him that would indicate that the sanctions are 
beginning to bite cheney told a conference of economists in 
washington 
his comments followed saddams videotaped message to americans 
broadcast tuesday and today that said us gulf forces faced the 
prospect of bigger losses than those suffered in the vietnam war 
the defense department reported tuesday that about 430000 iraqi 
soldiers are now in southern iraq and kuwait up from 360000 last 
week 
the us aircraft carrier independence and its 70 attack jets 
will soon join other warships in the gulf in a show of force a 
us military source in the gulf said today it would be the first 
us carrier in the gulf since 1974 
the source speaking on condition of anonymity declined to say 
when the 1000foot independence would sail in from the arabian 
sea 
the pentagon declined to comment 
officials concerned about vulnerability had been reluctant to 
send a carrier into the gulf whose entrance is the narrow strait 
of hormuz 
about 165000 us soldiers are stationed in the saudi desert 
and aboard ships in the region thousands of arab and european 
troops have also been deployed as part of the usled 
multinational force 
us marines defending saudi oilfields were told by their 
commander today to expect a long desert stay gen alfred gray also 
said the marines should be prepared to shift to offense if saudi 
arabia is attacked 
jordan joined egypt today in saying it will abide by the 
security council resolution calling for an embargo on the aircraft 
of iraq and occupied kuwait 
however three regularly scheduled iraqi airways flights arrived 
in amman from baghdad today the first carried 185 people aboard 
including 11 british women and children the two flights that 
landed later this morning and this afternoon also carried 
westerners 
jordanian officials said they were checking on details of the 
un resolution according to our initial studying of the 
resolution we understand that it does not bar human traffic 
said a cabinet minister on condition of anonymity 
jordan has been criticized by saudi arabia and other gulf 
nations for being reluctant to support international efforts 
against iraq 
the security council resolution passed 141 on tuesday with 
cuba the only country voting no in an unusual move intended to 
give symbolic weight to the resolution 13 of the 15 countries 
represented on the security council sent their foreign ministers to 
cast their countries vote ordinarily countries allow their 
ambassadors at the united nations to cast their votes 
only a few supplies have been flown in to baghdad since the 
invasion according to western officials 
the security council already has authorized military enforcement 
of a sea embargo the air embargo is largely symbolic since most 
trade with iraq is by land and has already been halted iraqs only 
major export is oil 
iraq has sought a way around the embargo by seeking better 
relations with iran its bitter foe in the 198088 war and 
reportedly attempted to exchange oil for food syrian president 
hafez assad reportedly failed during his visit to tehran this week 
to persuade the iranians not to ship supplies to iraq

a new nc17 movie rating barring 
children under 17 will be announced soon by the motion picture 
association of america in response to the controversy over the x 
rating sources said wednesday 
the new rating will prevent children from attending films judged 
by the mpaa ratings board to be harsher than an r rating but will 
carry none of the advertising and exhibition restraints that an x 
rating guarantees 
a spokeswoman for the association was not immediately available 
for comment the association said a news conference was scheduled 
for wednesday afternoon in new york city 
movies that have been given an x rating can be resubmitted for 
the nc17 rating said one source familiar with the mpaas 
decision 
the new nc rating will be copyrighted according to sources who 
spoke on condition of anonymity the x rating is not copyrighted 
and is used widely by the adult movie industry critics charge the 
x rating is synonymous with pornography 
in recent months the x rating has been given to a variety of 
critically acclaimed films including henry amp june from 
universal pictures and tie me up tie me down a miramax 
release from oscarnominated director pedro almodovar 
film companies say x ratings bar them from placing 
advertisements in newspapers and on radio and television stations 
many theater chains also refuse to show pictures bearing that 
rating 
the last time the ratings were changed was in 1984 when the 
pg13 rating was added between the pg and r ratings 
one source said the mpaa hopes to call the rating simply nc but 
is unsure if that can be copyrighted

students ignored prime minister vp 
singhs offer for talks and riots spread across northern india on 
wednesday in protest of a policy that reserves nearly half of the 
governments jobs for lowcaste hindus 
police shot and killed seven people in three northern indian 
cities including new delhi and imposed a curfew on 10 towns 
the army was ordered into several neighborhoods in the capital 
after protesters clashed with police for the second day 
in a continuing wave of protest suicides a student doused 
himself with gasoline near new delhis police headquarters and 
lighted a match inflicting burns over half his body before he was 
taken to hospital 
singh said he would rather resign than retract his new job 
policy 
i cannot barter away the aspirations of the deprived simply to 
retain my chair he said in a statement 
later in a speech read on staterun television and radio he 
said nothing has caused me more profound anguish than the 
decision of some young students to immolate themselves 
i am prepared to take any step consistent with the basic need 
for social justice to dispel the fears and mollify the feelings of 
those sections of youth who are apprehensive about their future 
he said 
singh appealed to students for talks on tuesday but a students 
group leading the protests said wednesday it would not talk until 
singh abandoned the job quotas they say the policy amounts to 
reverse discrimination 
wednesdays deaths brought to 34 the number of people killed in 
suicides and clashes with police since singh announced the 
affirmative action program on aug 7 
the violence escalated on tuesday after a student died of 
selfimmolation about 20 more have tried to burn themselves to 
death 
the violence spread to middleclass neighborhoods of new delhi 
where residents including women and children joined the students 
in shouting antigovernment slogans

streets local government officials said 
the protesters damaged at least 100 government vehicles set 
fire to 18 other vehicles and set ablaze a government revenue 
office a staterun department store and a bank they said 
uppercaste hindus say the job policy will ignore educational 
merit and deprive qualified students of their share of the 
governments 18 million jobs 
the government says the policy will balance the centuriesold 
inequities the rigid hindu caste system has imposed on the 
generally poorer and less educated low castes 
hindus comprise 82 percent of indias 880 million people and are 
divided into four major heriditary castes that assign a persons 
social standing and often the economic position but uppercaste 
students maintain that many lowcaste hindu have risen above 
economic deprivation and do not need affirmative action programs 
the opponents also call the policy a move to garner votes from 
the lowcastes who form a majority of indian voters

children are dying from abuse neglect and 
disease at a rate of 40000 a day worldwide the head of the un 
childrens fund said wednesday in a bid to raise awareness of the 
plight of the young 
this weekend president bush and about 70 other heads of state 
or government will gather for a summit at un headquarters to 
adopt a declaration placing children foremost among their national 
priorities 
james grant head of the un childrens fund said the 
declaration will be seen as marking a historic transformation in 
the way the world deals with the children 
we have always in all our religions and cultures given 
children a first call on the resources of the family grant said 
but what is happening now is an extension of this concept to the 
responsibilities of the nationstate to support the family 
the un general assembly adopted the convention on the rights 
of the child last november 
grant said that as of wednesday 43 nations had signed and then 
ratified the convention ratifying nations must guarantee the 
survival of children their protection and development 
more than 100 countries have signed on indicating their 
intention to have their legislatures ratify the convention grant 
said 
the united states has done neither conservatives in congress 
have criticized the convention because it forbids the death penalty 
for people younger than 18 and because it does not define a fetus 
as a child and thus give it special protections 
world leaders will meet sunday to debate the needs of children 
then adopt the declaration and an accompanying action plan 
the plan calls for a onethird reduction in infant mortality by 
the end of the decade access for all couples to family planning 
information and services prenatal care for all pregnant women 
reduction in the rate of low birth weight to below 10 percent a 95 
percent reduction in measles deaths and immunization of 90 percent 
of young children against childhood diseases 
grant said 40000 children die every day twothirds of them 
from largely preventable causes such as from not being vaccinated 
against six killer diseases or the dehydration from diarrhea for 
which we now have a lowcost remedy 
the six deadly childhood diseases are diarrheal disease 
malaria tetanus whooping cough measles and respiratory 
infections 
the other third of the deaths are caused by neglect abuse war 
poverty starvation and diseases for which there is no known cure 
such as aids 
in 1988 250000 civilians died in southern sudan because of 
civil war with the great majority of those being children grant 
said civil conflict the problems in the frontline states like 
mozambique and angola all of these contribute 
but whats clear is that twothirds of the child deaths we 
have today are from readily preventable causes 
leaders expected to attend the weekend un summit include prime 
minister margaret thatcher of britain president carlos saul menem 
of argentina czechoslovak president vaclav havel japanese prime 
minister toshiki kaifu and mexican president carlos salinas de 
gortari 
the meeting will cost 3 million all or most of which is being 
paid by donations from governments private organizations and 
individuals grant said

efforts by the united states and peru to agree 
on terms for a military aid program to fight drug smuggling have 
broken down the state department said wednesday 
as a result peru must forego 359 million in aid which will 
be earmarked instead for bolivia and colombia said deputy 
spokesman richard boucher 
the two countries were unable to overcome their differences in 
advance of the weekend deadline imposed by the united states the 
deadline coincides with the end of the us fiscal year 
boucher said the us and peruvian governments have stated that 
the drug problem is of vital importance to both our countries 
and we will continue to work together to solve it 
but the washington post quoting unnamed officials said 
peruvian negotiators had acted in bad faith one official said the 
bush administration was going to seriously reexamine its 
relations with peru with respect to drugs according to the post 
boucher said the opinion expressed in the post was not an 
official view 
the aid package was to have been used as part of overall plan to 
encourage peru to step up its efforts to curb drug smuggling peru 
is a major source of coca leaf from which cocaine is made

nations report card as a compendium of disappointment and as 
a guide for corrective action 
cavazos stressed that the study revealed significant 
discrepancies between what researchers indicate is most effective 
in improving educational performance and what students report about 
activities in the classroom and at home 
the report includes data from reading writing mathematics 
science us history civics and geography assessments conducted 
in 1986 and 1988 and trend results by the congressionally mandated 
project over the last two decades 
most of the data show that our present education performance 
is low and not improving 
top educators called for radical changes in the way education 
takes place in america and less talk and fewer studies from 
policymakers 
the report clearly shows the recent rhetoric from the bully 
pulpit has had a zero effort on student achievement said gordon 
cawletti executive director of the association for supervision and 
curriculum 
key findings of the report were 
students can read at a surface level getting the gist of 
material but do not read analytically or perform well on 
challenging reading assignments 
few students write well enough to accomplish the purposes of 
different writing tasks and most do not communicate effectively 
students grasp of the four basic arithmetic operations and 
beginning problem solving is far from universal in elementary and 
junior high school by the time students near highschool 
graduation half cannot handle moderately challenging material 
only small proportions of students appear to develop 
specialized knowledge needed to address sciencebased problems and 
the pattern for falling behind begins in elementary school 
students demonstrate an uneven understanding of the 
constitution and american government and politics their knowledge 
of the bill of rights is limited 
the study released one day before the first anniversary of the 
education summit that resulted in the six national education goals 
also showed that the performance gap between white and minority 
students has remained large even though there is some improvement 
by black and hispanic students

at least two bahraini families have won 
court approval to change the names of sons named after iraqs 
saddam hussein a newspaper reported wednesday 
the daily akhbar alkhaleej said one child was renamed ibrahim 
and another khalaf at the request of the parents 
some children were named saddam when he was widely regarded as 
an arab hero in the 198088 iraniraq war however after iraqs 
invasion of kuwait on aug 2 many persian gulf arabs felt the name 
saddam has become a synonym of disgust and anger the paper 
said

for one week the plight of earl hutchins an 
inner city familys partiarch who disappeared while suffering from 
alzheimers disease unified residents of a crimetorn 
neighborhood 
and though the communitys search ended tragically hutchins 
body was found tuesday in a harbor neighbors hope their effort 
may have a lasting effect by forging a new unity in milwaukees 
inner city 
it was a very large search moses jordan said it got 
together very quickly that was the first time something happened 
that i remember like this 
the 79yearold hutchins robbed of his memory by the disease 
disappeared from his north side home sept 19 his family 
immediately began distributing fliers and organizing search 
parties 
by friday more than 100 volunteers had been enlisted in the 
search which spread to suburban areas several members of alderman 
michael mcgees black panther militia a group formed this year to 
force change through the threat of violence led the effort 
the hutchins are an old family in milwaukee said jerrel 
jones a black community leader and spokesman for mcgee they 
have millions of relatives it was like a family member of the 
community being lost 
mcgee has promised to use his group beginning in 1995 to stage 
violent terrorist attacks if conditions for blacks most of whom 
live in impoverished neighborhoods on milwaukees north side 
dont improve 
while much of the attention on the inner city this year has 
focused on a drastic increase in violent crime milwaukee set a 
new homicide record tuesday with 116 killings the search for 
hutchins demonstrated a more important trend jones said 
theres a growing unity in the community jones said that 
search enhanced it because it was an issue everybody could agree 
on 
police were also impressed by the community effort 
we were really pushing to find this man because of his illness 
and his age inspector ronald mehl said we didnt want him 
wandering the streets because as you know we do have some 
problems on our streets 
we definitely appreciate all the help its the first time 
i can remember when that many people were involved 
the search ended tuesday when hutchins body was found in the 
milwaukee harbor miles away from his home an autopsy was being 
conducted wednesday and police refused to speculate whether foul 
play was involved 
i wanted a different ending said one of hutchins five 
daughters 49yearold maxine jeter we were planning a big 
reception planning to invite all these people who helped when 
daddy came home 
posters had been distributed throughout the city radio and 
television statons broadcast information about the search and a 
milwaukee office supply store had donated 20000 fliers 
hundreds of volunteers canvassed neighborhoods looking for any 
trace of the man 
and although the search ended mystery remains as to why 
hutchins left home was he a victim of crime or confused 
thats what got me said jordan 70 a longtime friend of 
hutchins he had a lovely family two boys and five girls he was 
well thought of he will be missed too 
while police unravel the mystery hutchins family can at least 
relish the outpouring of friendship from their community 
were so proud of the media and all the cooperation weve 
received said shirley warren 51 another daughter were 
proud to be milwaukeeans

president fw de klerk flew 
home wednesday with support from president bush for his efforts to 
end apartheid but south african politicians criticized his us 
trip 
de klerk was to arrive wednesday night to a festive welcome at 
jan smuts international airport 
during de klerks threeday trip to washington president bush 
praised him for what he called south africas irreversible 
progress toward creating a nonracial democracy 
bush however said south africa still must free all political 
prisoners and eliminate the apartheid system of racial segregation 
and white dominance before economic sanctions could be lifted 
south african political leaders from opposing sides criticized 
aspects of de klerks trip 
african national congress spokesman thebo mbeki said us 
officials were wrong in calling progress toward ending apartheid 
irreversible he said sanctions should be continued 
sanctions have been an important element in bringing us to 
where we are now mbeki said in a speech at the university of 
pretoria i wont contest that de klerk is irreversibly committed 
to change this does not mean the process itself is irreversible 
andries treurnicht head of the proapartheid conservative 
party said de klerk humiliated south african whites by bowing to 
us pressure to change he said bushs conditions for ending 
sanctions were uncalled for 
in other words further humiliation and concessions are 
demanded before the great america would be satisfied treurnicht 
said this is not the way to treat a sovereign state such as 
south africa 
the conservative party advocates continued white dominance and 
rejects de klerks moves toward negotiating power sharing with the 
black majority 
the whiteled government and the anc began peace talks in may 
aimed at fullblown negotiations on a new constitution 
winnie mandela wife of anc leader nelson mandela told a 
business group wednesday night that south africa needed a growing 
economy to smooth the transition of political change 
her comments were conciliatory compared with recent statements 
to black groups in which she said armed struggle remained a 
possibility if negotiations failed 
vicious street fighting between black factions in townships 
around johannesburg has strained relations between the government 
and the anc the nations largest black opposition movement 
about 800 blacks have been killed since aug 12 in warfare 
pitting xhosas and other anc supporters against zulus linked to the 
conservative inkatha movement 
the violence has eased recently following periods in which 
dozens of blacks died daily 
police imposed a 9 pmto4 am curfew tuesday night in some 
of the most turbulent townships black leaders criticized the 
curfew as a violation of rights and some groups called for 
supporters to defy it no incidents were reported 
residents who provide written proof of nighttime employment or 
ticket stubs to concerts movies and soccer games are exempt 
police said journalists covering the curfew also must provide 
written proof of employment 
in other developments police began an investigation into the 
deaths of seven people whose bodies were found monday along 
railroad tracks between johannesburg and soweto township 
police col frans malherbe said the deaths occurred during a 
panic created by a false alarm that the train was under attack he 
said criminal elements spread the attack rumor in order to 
steal passengers belongings in the confusion 
attacks on trains in the johannesburg area have killed more than 
two dozen people in recent weeks

sandinista workers on wednesday 
refused to surrender four of the 16 businesses the conservative 
government had returned to prerevolutionary owners 
workers at the el caracol food processing plant said they 
refused to let magelda campos inside when she showed up with a 
government order granting her ownership 
she left this enterprise in shreds never giving a thought to 
the workers and we have struggled to make it productive again 
said ronaldo rodriguez local secretary general of the sandinista 
national workers front 
he said workers want the government to give el caracol to them 
the plant has 130 employees 
the sandinistas confiscated hundreds of private businesses 
including restaurants car dealerships and factories during more 
than a decade of revolutionary rule that ended with their defeat in 
the feb 25 elections 
president violeta barrios de chamorros government inherited 
about 400 state enterprises when it took office on april 25 and 
she promised to privatize the economy 
mrs chamorro who flew to new york on wednesday to address the 
united nations during the general assemblys annual session said 
sandinista unrest would not stop her from returning nicaragua to a 
free enterprise economy 
in a televised speech tuesday night she accused the sandinistas 
of staging a new sabotage attempt against her government 
i will not allow it she said 
after their electoral defeat the sandinistas vowed to govern 
from below and block any attempts by the chamorro government to 
dismantle their leftist state sandinista workers paralyzed managua 
in may and again in july with strikes 
spokesmen for workers at the camas lunas bed factory and the 
sovipe small appliance plant in managua and the prego soap plant in 
grenada 30 miles away also said they would not hand over their 
factories 
the return of this enterprise was done only on paper we are 
not going to return anything said brenda escoto the local union 
leader at camas lunas which has 80 workers 
a sovipe worker told the conservative radio corp station that 
not all her coworkers were opposed to privatization 
but sandinistas wielding sticks chased out other workers who 
opposed the takeover of the enterprise said the woman who spoke 
on condition of anonymity 
meanwhile about 1000 people marched to the government complex 
to protest rumored layoffs of 9000 educators nationwide the 
government has denied the rumors 
the demonstration was peaceful apart from a few attempts to 
break through the police cordon at the government complex where 
more than 2000 officers were on hand 
education minister sofonias cisneros had denied the layoff 
rumors monday and blamed extremists a reference to the 
sandinistas for circulating them he said more than 600 new 
teachers had been hired since mrs chamorro took office

a former air traffic controller is positive he has 
unraveled the secret of flight 19 five navy torpedo bombers that 
vanished in 1945 and fed the bermuda triangle legend but getting 
proof is going to be expensive 
jon myhres solution was videotaped for a segment on nbctvs 
unsolved mysteries on wednesday 
but doubters include the navy smithsonian institution six 
publishers who rejected his book manuscript and people magazine 
which held myhres story after buying exclusive rights to his 
account 
ive given it my best shot ive done everything i can do 
said myhre of lantana who has spent his life savings of more than 
100000 to plot and pursue flight 19s five grumman tbm avenger 
torpedo bombers i know im right im just not in a position to 
prove it 
myhre has videotape shot from a minisubmarine in july of an 
upsidedown avenger sitting in 390 feet of water about 35 miles off 
cape canaveral but he doesnt have its serial number 
the plane just 2 miles from where myhre predicted flight 19 
went down was originally spotted during the search for debris from 
the explosion of the space shuttle challenger but it was ignored 
then 
flight 19s disappearance became part of the legend of the 
bermuda triangle an area where ships and planes supposedly 
disappear under mysterious circumstances involving ufos magnetic 
fields and other such phenomena flight 19 even figured in close 
encounters of the third kind in which first the planes and then 
the men were returned by aliens 
myhres answer to the puzzle came with a flash eight years ago 
when he read the final radio transmissions from the warplanes 
which took off from fort lauderdale for a training flight over 
parts of the bahamas on dec 5 1945 
the squadron leaders reported that both of his compasses were 
out of order 
at one point the squadron leader plotted a northeasterly course 
based on the assumption he had somehow reached the florida keys on 
the opposite side of florida myhre thinks that was part of the 
bahamas abacos chain 
at another point he reported he was over an island and no other 
land was visible 
myhre who has flown the region for years believes that was 
isolated walkers cay 
by replotting the flight from walkers cay using the navy 
transcriptions of the flights radio reports myhre came up ith a 
location where he thought flight 19 its planes out of fuel may 
have ended 
the spot was east of cape canaveral the avenger he filmed was 
found 2 miles away 
myhre learned of the plane spotted during the challenger search 
from news reports this summer with 25000 raised by two 
partners he hired a small research submarine and located the 
wreckage 
he was unable to locate a complete aircraft serial number on the 
upside down wreck 
footage of the avenger shows the last three digits 209 of a 
fivedigit navy service number on the left wingtip flight 19s 
lead airplane number was 73209 and navy records show only two 
other grumman tbm avengers with service numbers ending in 209 and 
neither was lost at sea 
the only thing we didnt get was a positive id on the planes 
serial number myhre said but raising the avenger could cost 
250000 
the planes landing gear is extended leading some to suggest 
that plane was lost while trying to land on an aircraft carrier 
instead of the squadrons suspected ditch 
but myhre insists he has the right plane and knows where the 
others are 
the other planes are further north in much deeper water im 
certain he said this was just the first to ditch and the 
tragic thing about it is he was only about seven minutes from land 
if theyd just kept going west

a nasa investigative team has 
identified 83 potential sources of columbias dangerous hydrogen 
leaks and exhaustive testing is expected to pinpoint the problem 
the space agency said wednesday 
the list of suspect parts was narrowed to 83 during an analysis 
of columbias engine compartment said william lenoir head of 
nasas space flight program 
hydrogen flooded the section during fueling last week thwarting 
nasas fourth attempt to send the shuttle on an astronomy mission 
any combination might actually be the culprit lenoir said 
workers will remove insulation from each suspected part and then 
flush helium through the system lenoir said if no leaks are 
found the process will be repeated with a different crew and 
equipment to try to be absolutely sure we havent missed 
anything he said 
if helium does escape the test will be repeated in an attempt 
to really understand what thats telling me at that joint so i 
can maybe make some correlations for the future lenoir said 
so far columbias leaks have appeared only when the shuttles 
external tank is filled with highly flammable liquid hydrogen at 
supercold temperatures which might cause shrinkage of a metal 
part and form the leak the nonflammable helium normally used in 
testing is room temperature 
we know from our previous experience that our helium test has 
not found some of these leaks we thought it should have and we 
want to know why lenoir said 
the external tank will be filled with liquid hydrogen for a 
special fueling test around midoctober after discoverys upcoming 
flight discovery is scheduled to lift off oct 6 with a satellite 
that will study the suns polar regions 
the national aeronautics and space administration plans to 
perform a second tanking test on columbia in november to see if all 
of the leaks have been plugged about a dozen tv cameras will be 
placed inside the engine compartment for both tests 
im hopeful we will have gone through this entire sequence and 
have columbia back in a flying sequence in december lenoir said 
we have specifically not laid that onto our engineering team 
theyre not driven by schedule they are to go out and find the 
leak find all of the leaks and then we can get on with it 
nasa plans no tanking test for discovery the only shuttle in 
which hydrogen leaks have not been found such a check would take 
five days 
a tanking test will be performed on atlantis before its early 
november flight hydrogen leaks were detected in fuel lines between 
the orbiter and its external tank during a similar test in late 
june

more than half the soviet troops 
stationed in czechoslovakia since the red army crushed the 1968 
prague spring reform movement have returned home a military 
official said wednesday 
gen svetozar nadovic a czechoslovak coordinator of the troop 
withdrawal said at least 40500 soldiers and officers from an 
estimated force of 73500 have left taking with them 800 tanks 62 
aircraft and 57882 tons of ammunition 
by the end of the year only one soviet motorized regiment 
should be left in the nation he said 
that means that czechoslovakia will have full sovereignty by 
the end of the year thats encouraging said svetozar 
he said the pullout is ahead of the schedule outlined in a 
february agreement between czechoslovak president vaclav havel and 
soviet president mikhail gorbachev that pact foresees a complete 
soviet pullout by july 1991 
after the soviets put down alexander dubceks attempts to create 
socialism with a human face in 1968 moscow kept about 1220 
tanks 2505 armored vehicles 77 combat planes and 146 helicopters 
in czechoslovakia 
since revolutions ousted communist governments across eastern 
europe last year soviet troops began leaving other warsaw pact 
nations such as hungary and east germany which monday formally 
announced its withdrawal from the alliance

the census bureau says 315 million americans 
or 128 percent of the population lived in poverty last year that 
was virtually no improvement over 1988 even as median household 
income was up slightly because of an unexplained bulge in the 
income of black households 
the poverty rate had previously declined since 1983 when it 
reached a high of 152 percent in 1988 it was 13 percent and the 
bureau said the slight dip to 128 percent in 1989 was not 
statistically significant 
daniel h weinberg chief of the housing and household economic 
statistics division of the bureau declined to speculate on what 
the figures for 1990 will show when they become available next 
year 
the report he said does not tell us anything about the 
current situation 
however robert greenstein executive director of the center of 
budget and policy priorities a private research group predicted 
the poverty rate will go up with the apparent end of the economic 
recovery of the 1980s 
our guess is that 1989 is the end of the trend greenstein 
said the likelihood is overwhelming that when the 1990 figures 
come out poverty will have started back up 
what struck us were two principal things no significant 
progress in reducing poverty and that the gaps between both rich 
and poor and the wealthy and the middle class hit the widest plane 
in more than 40 years greenstein said 
the share of the national income going to the threefifths of 
the families in the middle of the income spectrum was lower in 89 
than in any year since census began collecting those data in 47 
he said the share going to the poorest fifth was tied for the 
lowest of any year since 54 while the shares going to the 
wealthiest fifth and the richest 5 per cent were higher than at any 
point since 1947 
rep lee hamilton dind chairman of the joint economic 
committee commentedat 128 percent the poverty rate is still 
very high especially this far high especially this far into an 
economic expansion and the gap between the rich and the poor is 
widening when it should be shrinking 
census bureau standards provide that a family of four making 
less than 12675 a year is classified as poor 
the standards have come under criticism from both liberals and 
conservatives 
a study released last year by the joint economic committee 
indicated the poverty threshold might be raised as much as 50 
percent if it were adjusted for changes in family needs and 
spending patterns such as the increase in the share of income taken 
up by housing costs 
robert rector welfare and poverty policy analyst at the 
conservative heritage foundation said the report dramatically 
overstates the extent of true poverty because it does not count 
noncash government benefits such as food stamps and medicaid as 
income 
in an article published tuesday in the wall street journal 
rector said evidence is mounting that the census bureaus 
poverty report dramatically understates the living standards of 
lowincome americans 
in addition to the official poverty rae figure the bureau 
released calculations based on other experimental methods that 
showed different results some higher and some lower 
the official definition of poverty was developed by the social 
security administration in 1964 based on department of agriculture 
research on what people spend on food 
it counts income in money only by using an experimental formula 
that counts medicare medicaid school lunches food stamps and 
other benefits the census bureau arrived at a rate of 104 
percent 
weinberg said substitution of the experimental standards would 
not change the trend in poverty rates 
greenstein also said our sense is that the trend is pretty 
clear no matter how you measure it 
the report said americans median household income rose 13 per 
cent in 1989 to 28910 after adjusting for the rise in consumer 
prices the increase followed two years in which median income had 
been unchanged 
black household income was up 5 percent to 18080 but median 
incomes in white and hispanic households did not significantly 
change nor did the median income of black families or that of 
black men 
weinberg said the bulge for black households which resulted in 
the overall increase in median household income appeared to be the 
result of gains in income for black professional women living alone 
or with a roommate he had no explanation for this and said it 
could be the result of an anomaly in the sampling 
the report was based on a survey of 58000 us households in 
march 
it showed that per capita income in 1989 was 14060 an 
alltime high the figure was up 1 percent from 1988 which was 
also a record 
median household incomes increased in the northeast and west 
but remained unchanged in the south and midwest the report did not 
include statebystate figures 
the median earnings of all women working year around fulltime 
increased 18 percent to 18780 while the earnings of men 
decreased by the same percentage to 27430 weinberg said he did 
not know the reason for this it brought the ratio of 
femaletomale median earnings to 68 percent a record and up from 
66 percent a year earlier

one of the first nurses in the nation to 
contract the aids virus from a patient revealed her identity 
wednesday saying she wants to remind all health care workers how 
important it is to take precautions 
if this can happen to me in a small rural hospital in the 
midwest in the middle of the night in 1986 it can certainly happen 
to anybody in 1990 barb fassbinder told reporters 
also wednesday a weekly newspaper in monona a small town in 
northeastern iowa published a letter from the former nurse 
explaining how she contracted the human immunodeficiency virus 
we want to emphasize that i do not have the fullblown disease 
of aids but do have a few relatively minor health problems as a 
result of the infection of the hiv virus she said in her letter 
to the monona billboard 
ms fassbinder 36 stopped working at the hospital in february 
1989 because of health problems and now gets workers compensation 
benefits to pay for medical care the hospital also made a 
settlement agreement that remains confidential the familys lawyer 
said 
the mother of three told reporters she believes she contracted 
the virus in august 1986 during an unsuccessful attempt to 
resuscitate a patient at memorial hospital in prairie du chien 
wis 
she said a doctor told her to remove an intravenous tube from 
the patients arm that wasnt functioning properly she said she 
applied pressure for 10 minutes with her left index finger shielded 
only by a small piece of gauze all that was in reach 
she said the patients blood apparently mingled with her own 
through some small cuts she got while gardening 
it wasnt until december 1986 when she made a routine blood 
donation that the virus was detected ms fassbinder wasnt 
notified of the results until january 1987 
the case was one of the first three documented instances in the 
united states of such infection of a health care worker the 
national centers for disease control cited it as an example of why 
health workers must take precautions against being infected 
ms fassbinder said the burden of living with the secret had 
become too much and that she hoped some good could be accomplished 
by talking openly about aids and hiv infection 
we also need to emphasize that the hiv virus is very fragile 
outside the human body and can only be transmitted in a few very 
specific ways none of which includes social or casual contact or 
even living in the same household she said 
she added that her husband dave 43 and her children eva 13 
joel 10 and emily 7 are infectionfree 
she said she was gratified by the support of friends and 
neighbors who allow their children to continue to play at her 
house 
but things arent entirely the same said her husband who is a 
commercial honey producer 
i really long for normalcy again he said i wish we were 
back when barb was working nights and im complaining that shes 
working too much 
ms fassbinder who tires easily and suffers from chronic throat 
infections declined to discuss her future 
i dont like to talk prognosis she said it serves no 
purpose i feel good today and im happy

proposals to require food manufacturers to 
disclose the nutrition content of their products should be extended 
to restaurants a committee of experts recommended wednesday 
the institute of medicine panel also said nutrition labeling 
also should be required for fresh and frozen meat and poultry 
foodlabeling proposals on capitol hill and by the food and drug 
administration already include many of the provisions the panel 
recommended for packaged food seafood and produce 
but neither the pending legislation nor the draft regulations 
addresses meat poultry or restaurants 
the institute is an affiliate of the national academy of 
sciences the congressionally chartered private body established to 
provide scientific advice to government agencies 
the national restaurant association quickly registered its 
opposition to the committees recommendations saying most 
fastfood and fullservice restaurants already provide nutrition 
information voluntarily 
as restaurant operators we firmly believe our customers have a 
right to know what nutrients are in the foods they eat said 
association president mike hurst our concern is not with 
providing such information rather it is with how the information 
is conveyed 
officials at the department of agriculture which regulates meat 
and poultry had said they were waiting for the report before 
making any labeling proposals 
jim greene a spokesman for the departments food safety and 
inspection service said officials had not yet read the report but 
we plan to evaluate the specifics and plan what course to take in 
the near future 
at the food and drug administration spokesman jeff nesbit said 
the agency planned to consider nutritioncontent disclosure for 
restaurants some time in the future but grocery stores are our 
higher priority 
the fda part of the department of health and human services 
last july proposed regulations that would require nutrition 
labeling for nearly all packaged foods and fresh produce and 
seafood 
under its proposal labels would have to show the number of 
calories from fat the amount of saturated fatty acids cholesterol 
and total dietary fiber listing of some vitamins would become 
optional and serving sizes would be standardized 
currently about 60 percent of supermarket foods have nutrition 
information of the label much of that done voluntarily labeling 
is not required except when a manufacturer makes a nutrition claim 
or adds nutrients 
the institutes committee noted that americans spend about 43 
percent of their food money on meals eaten outside the home this 
is expected to amount to about 156 billion this year 
the experts applauded the efforts of some restaurants and 
fastfood chains that have begun providing nutrition information 
voluntarily but they said these efforts should be required by law 
all restaurants serving standardized menu items should be 
required to provide easy consumer access to nutrition profiles of 
standard menu items either by posting the information or printing 
it on containers said richard a merrill committee chairman and 
a law professor at the university of virginia 
other restaurants should have nutrition information for items on 
their menus available for consumers on request he said 
hurst said a national restaurant association survey last year 
showed that threequarters of the 39000 restaurants polled offer 
nutritional information to patrons who request it 
the institutes recommendation would be impractical and 
ineffective hurst said 
printing nutritional information on containers would be 
expensive and burdensome for fastfood restaurants because many of 
their containers are multipurpose he said 
requiring fullservice restaurants to have nutritional 
information on hand would also be costly and timeconsuming 
especially for establishments that change menus daily he said

mung beans yogurt and prayer have 
become an unlikely factor in colorados governors race 
republican gubernatorial candidate john andrews has acknowledged 
that he spent two years working for an organization that performed 
experiments designed to scientifically prove the power of prayer 
the experiments included prayer sessions with mung beans and 
yogurt among other things 
andrews who faces gov roy romer in the nov 6 general 
election sought to play down his involvement during 1987 and 1988 
with spindrift inc saying it didnt command a high priority 
with me he said tuesday he later decided to spend his time on 
higher priorities like public policy in colorado 
spindrift is an organization that studies parapsychology a 
discipline andrews described as a recognized field on the edge of 
exploring new knowledge 
spindrifts goal is to explain the relationship between prayer 
and healing through the experimental test said bill sweet of 
mount prospect ill the groups president people for thousands 
of years have believed in the power of prayer but theyve had no 
proof 
in one experiment 14000 mung beans were divided into two 
groups one was prayed over and the other was not 
according to a spindrift brochure nearly twice as many sprouts 
were counted in the group that was prayed over than in the group 
that was not the target of prayers 
in another experiment trays of rye grass were correlated with 
jars of yogurt and potted plants 
the plants were promised more light and the yogurt was 
promised milk if more of their seeds germinated than control 
seeds did according to a book about the experiments cathedral 
of the mind 
and it added their seeds did do better than control 
seeds 
andrews who was the groups general secretary during his two 
years there said he became involved with the group in an effort 
to help some friends do some networking he said he thought he 
could help them find grants and ways to evaluate their experiments 
all i was doing was using my experience in marketing and 
research said andrews who is on leave as executive director of 
the conservative think tank independence institute

president bush may rely on an untested legal 
theory to decide which federal programs should be cut sharply next 
week in case no deficitreduction agreement is reached 
administration aides said wednesday 
one official acknowledged that the administration is concerned 
about invoking such authority because congress is jealous of its 
constitutionally protected role as guardian of the federal purse 
strings 
this official reasoned that any shortterm political gain from 
bypassing congress on the spending cuts might be outweighed by a 
resulting deterioration of relations between the two branches 
however some legal scholars say that if the president is 
looking for a way to force spending reductions he might find 
authority in two 1980 advisory opinions by benjamin civiletti 
attorney general near the end of the carter administration 
the essence of civilettis opinions was that a president has 
inherent authority to protect human life and property even when 
congress has not appropriated money for such purposes 
john sununu bushs chief of staff and richard g darman 
director of the white house office of management and budget told 
senate republicans on tuesday that the civiletti option is under 
active consideration 
the maneuver could be used as early as monday that is oct 1 
the first day of the 1991 budget year and congress has yet to 
enact any of the required 13 annual appropriation bills 
a continuing resolution which would keep federal spending 
flowing until oct 20 is making its way through congress bush 
however has promised a veto because one section of the resolution 
would delay 85 billion of mandatory spending reductions called a 
sequester also until oct 20 
bush says that delaying those cuts would reduce pressure to 
write a package of spending reductions and tax increases that would 
slash the deficit by 500 billion over five years he indicated he 
will accept no delays in the arbitrary cuts until a deficit 
agreement is imminent 
if by monday morning bush has refused to sign the continuing 
resolution there will be no money to run most federal programs 
nor will there be any money to sequester 
that is when the civiletti option might be used 
the president invoking his authority to protect human life 
and property could decide that defense department workers should 
come to work and that the justice department should stay home 
foreignaid spending could be frozen national parks could be shut 
down and egg inspectors could be furloughed but the internal 
revenue service could be ordered to keep collecting taxes 
thus the president would have spent federal funds despite the 
constitutional requirement that any spending be approved by 
congress 
this is an area in which there are no cases alan feld a 
boston university school of law professor who has written on the 
civiletti opinion and the federal antideficiency law in which it 
is rooted said in an interview 
all weve got is the bare statute feld said the attorney 
generals opinion is the most authoritative construction of that at 
this moment but it could be wrong it is just the advice the 
president is getting 
aides to some republican senators said there was considerable 
concern among republicans about the presidents acting in such a 
fashion even though they were reluctant to criticize the proposal 
while a deficit agreement was being negotiated 
sen robert c byrd dwva chairman of the senate 
appropriations committee and ardent defender of congressional 
authority was more blunt 
on the face of it he said this appears to be nothing 
more than a thinly veiled attempt to selectively apply the 
sequester

the ryan white emergency aids bill is just 
the symbol of an empty promise from congress the boys mother 
said wednesday 
the disasteraid measure named for the indiana teen who died in 
april after becoming a national aids spokesman authorized 600 
million in emergency aids spending for the nations hardesthit 
cities 
however the bill was severely undercut when a senate 
subcommittee proposed actual spending of only the first 110 
million in the coming year deferring the rest until after oct 1 
1991 
my family and i were honored when congress chose to place my 
sons name on the bill jeanne white said at a news conference at 
the capitol but now the act with no funding is at best the 
symbol of an empty promise 
mrs white urged members of the senate to endorse an alternative 
introduced by sens brock adams dwash frank lautenberg dnj 
and alfonse damato rn regulated by the agencies 
said jim greene a spokesman for the inspection service in 
washington 
obviously if you dont have federal inspectors you cant 
operate your plant said gene meakins vice president of public 
relations for monfort 
that could cause ripples throughout the industry such as a 
backlog of cattle at feed yards and higher consumer prices company 
officials say 
harry siegelman group vice president of cattle procurement for 
monfort said wednesday the company wont buy cattle for the week 
of oct 8 
we are planning on not killing that week the way it stands 
right now with inspection he said 
monfort based in greeley colo has a garden city plant that 
employs 1270 people 
dave bartel a spokesman for sen nancy kassebaum rkan said 
earlier this week that if a budget agreement isnt reached 
kassebaum has promised a continuing resolution to keep the present 
arrangement with meat inspectors until there is an agreement 
officials at ibp which owns a 2700employee plant near garden 
city said they were working through the american meat institute in 
arlington va to ensure a furlough doesnt happen 
were not aware of any slowdowns at this point said gary 
mickelson manager of communications 
he said it wasnt the first time the industry has faced the 
possibility of a budgetrelated furlough of inspectors but they 
were always averted before 
were hopeful this will be the case this time mickelson 
said 
rich parker director of information for the american meat 
institute in arlington va said members of congress have been 
told that furloughs could hurt the industry 
theres a possibility you could see a shutdown but we dont 
think it will happen he said 
five giant packing plants in southwest kansas including monfort 
and ibp employ more than 8200 people the state ranked first in 
the nation in 1989 for the number of cattle slaughtered at 62 
million head killed

defense secretary dick cheney said wednesday 
the odds are mounting that iraq will launch a military strike in 
response to un economic sanctions 
cheney told a conference of business economists that the bush 
administration had foreseen that a key danger point in the standoff 
with saddam hussein would arise once the international sanctions 
began crippling the iraqi economy 
we may have seen in the last 48 or 72 hours the beginning 
commentary from him that would indicate that the sanctions are 
beginning to bite cheney said 
the un security council voted to mpose an economic embargo 
against exportdependent iraq on aug 6 four days after the iraqi 
army invaded kuwait on tuesday the security council extended the 
embargo to include air shipments 
in a televised address to americans broadcast tuesday saddam 
criticized the united states and the united nations for punishing 
his economy in response to the occupation of kuwait saddam said 
us forces deployed in the persian gulf area faced the prospect of 
bigger losses than were suffered in the vietnam war 
saddam also said this week that he would destroy the middle 
easts oil fields if war broke out 
we have always operated on the assumption since we started 
this exercise in early august that there result of the un embargo which 
is being enforced by a multinational naval fleet in the persian 
gulf the arabian sea and the red sea 
the pentagon also reported that iraq has increased its troop 
strength in kuwait and southern iraq to 430000 soldiers the

city university of new york faced with 42 
million in budget cuts has canceled 2000 classes dropped 670 
teachers slashed library hours and limited enrollment officials 
said wednesday 
vice chancellor jay hershenson said cuts were being handled in 
a way so that the core academic programs are protected and 
guarded he said class sizes had increased however but he 
didnt know by how much 
officials said the budget woes were exacerbated by a 26 percent 
increase in the number of students bringing total enrollment at 
cunys 11 fouryear colleges and seven twoyear community colleges 
to 200121 the highest in 14 years 
the overall increase in students came as the state reduced its 
contribution to cunys fouryear colleges by 29 million to more 
than 800 million and the city cut its contribution to community 
colleges by 13 million to 160 million 
as a result officials said they had to limit freshman 
enrollment to those who applied by the aug 6 deadline rather than 
extending it as they have in past years that resulted in 3000 to 
5000 freshman applicants being denied admission hershenson said 
to make ends meet officials canceled 2000 classes taught by 
adjunct teachers and dropped 670 adjunct teachers 270 at the 
senior colleges and 400 at the community colleges adjunct teachers 
are hired on a semestertosemester basis rather than under a 
continuing contract 
cuny also cut library financial aid counseling and other 
services by 93387 hours hershenson said 
the universitys budget this year is 11 billion tuition is 
1250 a year for a fulltime student

the house voted wednesday to strengthen 
coastal states power over offshore oil drilling 
the bill approved 39132 would overturn a 1984 supreme court 
decision that allowed the federal government to sell offshore oil 
leases without checking to see if drilling complied with states 
plans for its coast 
back in 1972 we made a bargain with the states said rep 
walter jones dnc chairman of the merchant marine and fisheries 
committee who sponsored the bill a revision of the coastal zone 
management act 
if they developed coastal zone management programs which met 
federal standards and received federal approval we promised that 
federal agencies would adhere to these programs 
the problem is that federal agencies have not lived up to this 
bargain 
the supreme court decision stemmed from a lawsuit filed by the 
interior department under president reagan against california for 
trying to stop oil drilling 
the justices ruled that lease sales for drilling on the outer 
continental shelf did not directly affect the coastal zone and 
therefore was exempt from californias management program 
the decision has led to other uses of coastal areas by federal 
agencies that sometimes oppose states management programs said 
jones office 
jones bill establishes a new rule that says any federal 
activity including offshore oil and gas leasing which affects 
any natural resources land uses or water uses in a coastal zone 
would be subject to state review 
the bill says that if the state finds the federal activity to be 
inconsistent with its plan it may ask a federal court to halt the 
activity 
a similar bill is awaiting floor action in the senate however 
the bush administration opposes overturning the 1984 supreme court 
decision and has threatened to veto the legislation 
the coastal management program includes the us territories and 
states on the oceans and the great lakes it is voluntary however 
and five states indiana georgia minnesota illinois and texas 
do not participate 
nonparticipation means the states do not get federal grants 
associated with the program or protection from offshore oil 
drilling if this version of the bill becomes law 
jones bill also requires states participating in the management 
program to develop a water quality strategy to clean up and prevent 
further pollution of coastal waters 
increasingly our nations population is concentrated along 
the coast said jones during debate on the bill i dont need 
to remind my colleagues of the environmental problems which we are 
facing because of this growth

jesse jackson said wednesday that he is an 
honorable taxpayer and that he will file a district of columbia 
tax return for 1989 even though it may not be legally required 
jackson who is running for the symbolic job of shadow 
senator from the district a post for lobbying congress for dc 
statehood said he has instructed his accountant to file with the 
city a partyear tax form for last year 
jacksons decision came after the washington times reported 
wednesday that the twotime democratic presidential hopeful did not 
file a local tax return last year even though he moved his family 
to the nations capital and registered to vote here in august 
1989 
city tax officials said that even if jackson had filed the form 
he likely would be entitled to a tax credit and would not owe the 
city any money both jackson and a city official agreed that the 
law governing his filing requirement is murky 
we discussed the matter further with local tax experts they 
suggested that the law is vague jacksons office said in a 
statement if through a difference in interpretation he has 
failed to meet a technical requirement in the district that 
requirement will be met immediately by filing a 1989 partyear dc 
tax form 
jacksons accountant lester mckeever of chicago originally 
determined that jackson was not obligated to file a district 
return 
edward many acting associate director for audit compliance and 
investigation for the citys finance and revenue department said 
that residents who move to the district are required to file a tax 
form for that year only if they live in washington for at least 183 
days of the year 
jacksons office said his move to washington was made official 
on aug 3 when he switched his voting registration from chicago 
on that date there were 151 days left in the year 
but another part of the city tax code stipulates that if the 
person is permanently moving to the district he must file the 
partyear form for that year regardless of when the move takes 
place 
in the statement jackson identified himself as a permanent 
resident

alberto moravia one of italys most widely read 
authors who was censored by both fascist and vatican authorities 
died of a heart attack at his home wednesday he was 82 
moravias books many exploring alienation and disillusionment 
with modern society had been translated into all major languages 
and inspired at least eight movies 
in recent years he cut back on his prolific writing schedule 
but made frequent appearances on televison talk shows and 
contributed travel pieces to newspapers an autobiography in the 
form of an interview was due out within weeks 
moravia was ageless with his mental lucidity and constant 
presence in the literary and cultural life of our time said 
valentino bompiani who published moravias works for more than 50 
years 
moravia had been pronounced in good health by a doctor two days 
ago he died seconds after being striken by the heart attack said 
his doctor antonio severini 
moravia and his spanish wife carmen were married in 1986 when 
she was 32 moravias body was taken to the campidoglio or capitol 
hill where senate president giovanni spadolini and rome mayor 
franco carraro were among the mourners funeral services were set 
for friday and burial will be at the moravia family tomb in rome 
another major postwar italian author italo calvino died in 
1985 italys umberto eco has gained attention in the united states 
for several novels including the bestselling the name of the 
rose 
moravias novels often with sexual themes upset fascist 
authorities in the 1930s and roman catholic censors in the 1950s 
la romana about a prostitutes vain search for love in 
postwar rome won moravia world fame it was first published in 
italian in 1947 and its english edition the woman of rome 
sold 1 million copies in the united states and made him the 
bestknown italian writer to many americans 
another major work la ciociara was set in world war ii 
when the allies fought their way from the beaches south of rome on 
the way to liberating the italian capital film director vittorio 
de sica turned the 1957 book into the movie two women with 
sophia loren in an oscarwinning role 
in 1952 the vatican declared all moravias novels and stories 
immoral and placed them on its index of forbidden books the list 
was abolished following the 196365 second vatican council 
born alberto pincherle in rome on nov 28 1907 moravia spent 
much of his childhood suffering from a crippling bone disease he 
often said his approach to life and his writing was largely molded 
by the boredom of his youth 
in 1925 while still on crutches he began his first novel 
the indifferent ones which portrayed the decline of italys 
middleclass in the first years of fascism he paid to have the 
book printed in four languages 
while critics assailed the work it sold quickly 
from october 1934 to may 1935 moravia was in new york lecturing 
at columbia university his encounter with american culture and 
values struck him deeply and fascist authorities began to regard 
moravia with suspicion 
in 1941 the censor seized fancy dress party about a 
grotesque dictator in an imaginary south american country later 
moravia was forbidden to write at all 
in 1941 he married writer elsa morante their marriage ended in 
1962 the next year moravia began living with dacia maraini a 
young author and prominent feminist 
when the germans occupied rome in september 1943 moravia of 
jewish ancestry and listed as subversive by fascist police tried 
to cross the allied lines to naples instead he spent nine months 
hiding with peasants in the mountains 
his wartime experiences were the basis for two women and 
other works 
moravias most prolific years were from 1941 to 1960 during 
which he wrote eight novels and several collections of stories 
including roman tales and new roman tales 
after empty anvas in 1960 moravia concentrated on short 
stories essays film reviews and accounts of his travels 
especially in africa 
in 1970 he shocked the literary world with the novel the two 
of us a dialogue between a sexually hyperactive scriptwriter and 
his genitals some critics described it as moravias surrender to 
alienation 
a ford worker is as alienated as stalins subjects the 
employee as the employer moravia once said vulgarity and 
irreality affect contemporary man 
moravias concern over nuclear arms led him to visit hiroshima 
japan and thrust him into politics in 1984 he was elected to the 
european parliament as a representative of italys independent left 
party

people who had profited from government policies that caused the

problem 
bert ely a conservative advocate of federal deposit insurance 
reform told a task force established by the house banking 
committee that all taxpayers should shoulder the cleanup burden 
the thrift crisis resulted from defects in the insurance 
program which benefits the entire nation by keeping the banking 
system afloat he said 
attempting to impose this loss particularly in a punitive 
manner on select groups of taxpayers would be unfair and 
counterproductive for the economy ely said 
our fellow citizens can smell that something is rotten in the 
state of america said rep joseph kennedy ii dmass they 
demand that they not be stuck paying for fiascos they neither 
caused nor profited from 
the task force is studying who should pay the hundreds of 
millions of dollars needed to rescue the ailing thrift industry 
kennedy testified in favor of legislation he introduced that 
would levy a 75 percent surtax on unearned income such as 
interest and dividends of people earning over 100000 a year 
corporations earning over 75000 a year would pay a 5 percent 
surtax and a provision that forgives taxes on appreciated capital 
gains at death would be abolished 
rep howard wolpe dmich asked for support of a bill he 
introduced as chairman of a caucus representing 18 northeastern and 
midwestern states noting that many of the failed thrifts are 
statechartered he said carelessness and lax regulation by state 
governments were a littlenoticed cause of the sampl crisis 
his bill would establish a formula for determining which states 
caused an excessive share of the problem the governments of 
those states would be required to pay into a special fund for the 
thrifts they charter to remain eligible for federal deposit 
insurance 
texas would pay the biggest bill 28 billion thrifts in that 
state account for 72 percent of the sampl losses but texas currently 
stands to pay only 6 percent of the cleanup costs a study by the 
northeastmidwest coalition says 
texas encouraged a massive construction boom and by abusing 
the federal deposit insurance system has levied a tax on our 
citizens to pay for it wolpe said if that isnt a transfer of 
wealth i dont know what is 
ely however said the regional disparity had been vastly 
overstated for example although texas benefited from local 
construction projects financed by sampls many of the materials came 
from outside the region he said 
task force chairman rep bruce vento dminn also voiced 
uneasiness about punishing texas 
before we get into a new civil war i want to make sure we do 
something thats workable vento said 
meanwhile the congressional budget office released a study of 
deposit insurance reform options that appeared to support the idea 
of broadbased taxpayer responsibility for the bailout 
deposit insurance funds were never expected to cover 
catastrophes and the thrift collapse represents an extraordinary 
or catastrophic situation said banking committee chairman henry 
gonzalez dtexas who requested the study

the federal aviation administration concerned 
about signs of poor performance in recent air disasters is 
encouraging changes in flight training to prompt flight crew 
members to work as a team the agency said wednesday 
when it first proposed the change early last year the faa cited 
studies showing that more than 60 percent of fatal airline 
accidents were caused by breakdowns of communication in the cockpit 
rather than mechanical failures or lack of pilot skills 
the faa said then it was clear that in many cases flight crews 
did not work well together and therefore did not make use of all 
the resources at hand during a crisis 
the new faa rule allows airlines the option that airlines use 
cockpit resource management training to emphasize crew 
coordination 
according to the faa such advanced training focuses on 
communications skills coordination and decisionmaking 
this is a bold new approach to the training of flight crew 
members that is sorely needed and one which i believe will enhance 
safety and improve cockpit efficiency said faa administrator 
james b busey

consumer spending rose 05 percent in august 
the government said wednesday in a report indicating personal 
consumption remained reasonably strong despite the persian gulf 
oilprice shock 
i thought consumption would take more of a hit from the energy 
shock but it didnt said michael k evans of evans economics 
inc in washington 
the commerce department said spending totaled 369 trillion at 
a seasonally adjusted annual rate up 167 billion from a month 
earlier it was the smallest advance since last may when spending 
was unchanged from april 
the department also said personal incomes rose 03 percent to a 
seasonally adjusted annual rate of 468 trillion a 13 billion 
increase over july it was the smallest increase since a 02 
percent gain in april 
but the department revised the spending increases upward from 
05 percent to 06 percent in july and from 1 percent to 12 
percent in june 
the upward revisions in june and july showed that consumer 
spending appeared to be recovering in june and the oil shock 
didnt make that much of a dent in it evans said 
it indicates that consumers are taking a relatively healthy 
attitude despite recent evidence in consumer surveys suggesting 
otherwise added gilbert benz an economist with swiss bank corp 
in new york 
consumer spending is considered a barometer of economic health 
because it accounts for about twothirds of the nations economic 
activity many analysts have expressed concern since it advanced 
just 02 percent at an annual rate in the second quarter as 
measured by the gross national product 
benz noted that when consumer spending is adjusted for 
inflation it posted a 01 percent decline 
its the result of the oil shocks weve seen in august and 
that continue in september he said 
inflation as measured by the labor departments consumer price 
index rose 08 percent in august 
the department said the savings rate last month savings as a 
percentage of disposable income was 43 percent the lowest since 
a 40 percent rate in september 1989 the rate was 45 percent in 
july and 46 percent in june 
americans disposable income income after taxes increased 
02 percent down from a 05 percent gain in july when adjusted 
for inflation it fell 03 percent 
a key component of the income category wages and salaries 
rose 700 million a small fraction of the 162 billion increase 
the previous month 
on the spending side the 167 billion increase in personal 
consumption which includes everything except interest payments on 
debt was down from a 206 billion gain in july 
spending on durable goods bigticket items expected to 
last more than three years totaled 480 billion down 59 
billion from july it was the first decline in durablegoods 
spending since a 77 billion drop in may 
nondurablegoods spending however rose 117 billion to 12 
trillion following a 16 billion gain in july spending on 
services was up 11 billion to 2 trillion after an 11 billion 
gain the previous month

while new yorks famous carnegie hall 
celebrates its 100th birthday its littleknown counterpart in 
southern west virginia is patching a leaky roof and trying to start 
its own musical renaissance 
i think that carnegie hall has great potential as not only a 
cultural but also as an economic factor said its executive 
director vivian conly 
the greenbrier county building bearing steel baron and 
philanthropist andrew carnegies name was built in 1902 as part of 
a womens college the lewisburg female institute conly said 
carnegie donated 33000 to james lang an institute trustee 
when several buildings on the campus were destroyed by fire lang 
and carnegie were from the same area of scotland according to hall 
records 
the donation was used to build a 500seat theater and performing 
arts center the greek revivalstyle building is across the street 
from a colonial church in this town of 3600 site of a major civil 
war battle 
the hall lay dormant for many years after the womens college 
closed in 1972 and was sold to a state mental hospital the 
building was condemned in 1983 but a citizens group raised the 
money to turn it into a performing arts center 
the center with 450 member families is operated by a staff of 
four with a budget of 214000 said conly who became executive 
director last year 
she said she quit her job as advertising director of the 
greenbrier resort to take on a new challenge the halls 
attempted comeback 
the venue has won praise from performers and patrons for its 
intimate setting 
its a wonderful place to see people because you can see the 
expressions on their faces conly said 
the halls performances once were primarily classical but now 
include gospel jazz bluegrass and folk music artistic programs 
director mary leb said wednesday 
the vienna boys choir the west virginia sympony and taj mahal 
have all performed there 
a local theater group performed steel magnolias a few months 
ago and another play is tentatively lined up for next year 
but the fourstory brick building is in need of extensive 
refurbishing including a new roof new lighting electrical wiring 
and plumbing conly said 
some 125000 has been raised toward a 150000 roofrepair 
project 
fundraisers also hope to bring in revenue from fall classes 
taught in the buildings art studios and classrooms subjects 
include painting sculpture gardening calligraphy and french 
for many reasons it wasnt closely maintained over the 
years conly said it needs a tremendous amount of 
restoration

political offspring are meeting mixed success 
as they try to follow in their parents footsteps in this years 
elections 
in new mexico tom udall son of former arizona congressman and 
secretary of the interior stewart udall is running for attorney 
general against a freshman legislator who says he doesnt think the 
udall name is helping his opponent 
in california kathleen brown daughter of one former governor 
and sister of another tells voters im a different shade of 
brown 
in minnesota ted mondale son of former vice president walter 
mondale is challenging a state senator who says the younger 
mondale has no background of any kind other than that hes worked 
in his fathers campaigns 
mondale and his opponent twoterm state sen phyllis mcquaid 
both describe their race as a close one 
you take a name as wellknown in minnesota as mondale its 
clearly very much of a threat ms mcquaid said in a telephone 
interview 
but she added if his name was ted brown no one would take 
the race seriously based on his lack of experience 
her remark recalled another candidates jab at a political 
neophyte nearly three decades ago 
when edward m kennedy ran for senator from massachusetts in 
1962 state attorney general edward j mccormack jr his rival for 
the democratic nomination jeered if your name was simply edward 
moore instead of edward moore kennedy your candidacy would be a 
joke 
kennedy was 30 at the time two years younger than mondale is 
now he beat mccormack went on to be elected and is still in the 
senate his son patrick is running for a second term in the rhode 
island legislature 
mondale whose father was minnesota attorney general and a us 
senator before becoming vice president and running for president 
said the family name can be a handicap as well as an asset 
there are those i think that probably want to punish you 
because they feel that everything you have gotten in life has been 
handed to you he said i guess you have to go the extra mile 
to show who you are and what your background is and what you want 
to do 
ms browns father edmund g brown and her brother edmund 
jr both served as governor of california 
having grown up in a political family i pledged i would never 
get into politics she said 
now at 44 with two terms on the los angeles board of education 
behind her she is the democratic nominee for state treasurer 
challenging republican incumbent thomas hayes 
when it comes to fundraising she said i think there is a 
credibility that i have as a candidate walking in the door because 
of my family name but i think once i am in that door nobody is 
going to give money to me if they dont think that i am a credible 
and viable candidate in my own right it doesnt matter what your 
name is people are not in the business of throwing money away on 
bad horses 
udall the nephew of rep morris k udall dariz won a lively 
contest for the democratic nomination for attorney general of new 
mexico and is leading his opponent state sen william davis in 
the polls an albuquerque journal poll found that 87 percent of the 
people knew who he was compared with 18 percent for davis 
davis a firstterm state senator attributed udalls big edge 
in name familiarity to his previous races for congress and a lively 
primary for the attorney general nomination 
thats the real issue not his dads or his uncles name he 
said those connections help him get money but i dont think 
they help him much in name identification i dont think we pay 
that much attention to arizona politics in new mexico 
udall said i ran in a very high profile hotly contested race 
in 1988 and we came within 5000 votes of taking an open 
congressional seat that race i think had an awful lot to do with 
my standing today i remember when i got in that primary in 1988 
my name identification and my standing in the polls was about 3 
percent 
there is no doubt that people know the udalls and know my 
fathers service to the country and they also ask about it many 
times on the campaign trail he said its usually out of 
admiration for what they have done 
honolulu attorney matthew matsunaga son of the late sen spark 
matsunaga dhawaii did not fare so well in his political outing 
matsunaga 31 campaigned for congress partly on the basis of 
his long residence in washington and said the network of contacts 
made by his father would help him he finished third in a 
threecandidate field in saturdays primary 
having a name like matsunaga created a lot of publicity and 
thats what helped with name recognition he said 
the advantage of having a father who was a very popular 
politician is that many people are inclined to vote for me simply 
because of my father matsunaga added the disadvantage of 
course is people who claim that i am simply capitalizing on my 
fathers name some people expect a lot more of me

addicts

house democrats turned back a gop effort 
wednesday to rein in lawmakers use of free mailing privileges in 
election years and weaken the role of union political action 
committees in financing their campaigns 
on a 225194 largely partyline vote the house rejected a 
republican motion telling negotiators on campaign finance reform to 
accept senate proposals to reduce gifts to a candidate from a 
single pac from 10000 to 2000 and disclose how much each 
congressmen spends on franked mail 
this is the last chance to get on a stage leaving dodge that 
might actually reach some destination instead of heading for a veto 
and politics as usual said rep pat roberts rkan 
the vote was on a motion to the appointment of 28 
representatives to a conference committee that will attempt to iron 
out differences between house and senate versions of campaign 
finance reform legislation the senate appointed its negotiators 
last week 
both the house and senate passed largely democratic bills just 
before the august recess that would establish ceilings on how much 
candidates would spend and lawmakers concede their is little chance 
that any measure will become law this year 
president bush has said he would veto any bill with taxpayer 
financing of congressional campaigns even though money raised 
though presidential races are already funded through voluntary 
checkoffs on tax returns 
bush and most other republicans also adamantly oppose spending 
ceilings on grounds that gop challengers need all the money they 
can raise to offset the name recognition of incumbent democrats 
who hold majorities in both the house and senate 
the senate in july conceded to bushs demand that pacs be 
outlawed even though lawmakes in both parties acknowledge that 
the supreme court will likely rule such a ban an unconstitutional 
infringement of free speech 
included as a fallback position in its bill was a provision 
reducing from 10000 to 2000 how much a pac could contribute to 
a single candidate for both the primary and general elections 
the bill approved by the house last month would allow candidates 
to get only half of their campaign funds from pacs pacs of unions 
and other organizations that get their money in donations of 240 
or less could continue giving up to 10000 per election 
but pacs raising their money though individual donations greater 
than 240 chiefly corporations could spent only 2000 per 
candidate 
the senate also would forbid lawmakers from using free mailing 
privileges in years they are up for reelection for senators 
thats just one year out of every six but for representatives its 
every other year 
in their effort to change the houses position wednesday 
republicans ignored the senate language on no free mail in election 
years but they called for adoption of other measures in the senate 
bill that would require the reporting every three months of how 
much each congressman spends on franking 
every evennumbered year we have to approve hiring a virtual 
army of parttime employees at an extra cost of hundreds of 
thousands of dollars just to move out newsletters said roberts 
postal service records show that house members use of the 
franking privilege to mail out newsletters free rises substantially 
in election years a practice that republicans contend is unfair to 
challengers 
for example the postal service estimates its cost of delivering 
franked mail from house members was 443 million in 1987 rising 
to 779 million in 1988 and falling back to 572 million in 1989 
this election year the postal service estimates it will have to 
spend 789 million delivering mail for incumbent representatives 
even though the house appropriated 407 million for it

the united states will begin withdrawing 
40000 troops from europe next month and start closing down their 
units in january defense secretary dick cheney said wednesday 
cheney said his decision was made in consultation with the nato 
allies and was in anticipation of a 23nation conventional forces 
in europe agreement being reached by years end to substantially 
reduce troops and military equipment across europe 
we have to begin the drawdown now to respond in an orderly way 
to changing security requirements and declining defense budgets 
cheney said in a statement 
the unilateral pullout of troops from europe is the largest by 
the united states since the mid1960s when the administration of 
president lyndon johnson restructured the us commitment to 
europe 
the decision while not directly related to the buildup of us 
forces in the persian gulf area would give the pentagon extra 
flexibility in fielding troops to spell some of the more than 
165000 american troops now in the gulf region 
the defense secretary said he ordered gen colin powell 
chairman of the joint chiefs of staff to remove 30000 army and 
10000 air force members from europe starting in october 
the united states has about 300000 army and air force personnel 
in europe 
lt col rick oborn a pentagon spokesman said the affected 
units in europe would be deactivated and the soldiers and airmen 
would be transferred to other areas 
cheney said that to allow planning time and to ease the 
logistics strain no units will be deactivated before jan 1 he 
said it normally takes three to four months to close down a 
military unit once the deactivation order is issued 
under the current us proposal at the conventional forces 
negotiations in vienna us and soviet forces in europe would be 
reduced to 195000 for each side the soviet union says it plans to 
remove all its troops from europe by the mid1990s 
in a speech to a conference of business economists friday 
cheney while not mentioning the withdrawal of troops from europe 
said the pentagon was beginning to adapt to the new world that we 
are now fortunate enough to live in in terms of reduced ussoviet 
hostilities 
he said the united states would have years of warning time 
of an impending soviet attack in europe giving plenty of time to 
return us forces to the area 
cheney said details on which units will be closed down and a 
timetable for the withdrawals will be announced later by the 
headquarters of the us army europe and us air force europe 
in its version of the fiscal 1991 defense authorization bill 
the senate called for a cut of 100000 in worldwide us forces 
including 50000 in europe the house version of the bill calls for 
a total cut of 129500 including 50000 in europe 
on capitol hill rep william dickinson of alabama the ranking 
republican on the house armed services committee said cheneys 
action is prudent damage limitation in light of the deeper cuts 
adopted by the house and senate 
theres a freight train called personnel cuts barreling down 
on the department of defense so dick cheney has done the right 
thing by taking steps now to try to soften the blow on people in 
the year ahead dickinson said in a statement

iraq told diplomatic missions in baghdad 
that starting monday it will no longer provide them with food 
rations for distribution to their communities diplomats said 
wednesday 
tens of thousands of nonarab foreigners are still in iraq and 
iraqioccupied kuwait about 6000 of them are westerners they are 
banned from traveling and some are held at key installations and 
potential targets in the event of an attack to retake kuwait by 
multinational forces in saudi arabia 
the diplomats quoted a foreign ministry memorandum as saying 
rations will be suspended as of monday oct 1 because the latest 
un security council resolution imposing an air embargo on iraq 
was expected to create major food shortages 
the memorandum was delivered to all nonarab missions 
the trade ministry announced another stage of food rationing due 
to un sanctions imposed after iraqs aug 2 invasion of kuwait 
it said iraqs 17 million people had already received food rations 
for september and that octobers ration distribution would begin on 
saturday 
the trade and finance minister mohammed mahdi saleh said 
rationing will include basic food supplies including rice flour 
cooking oil sugar and tea 
we received a memorandum explaining that the governments 
priority is to feed the iraqi population a western diplomat 
said 
he spoke to the associated press on condition of anonymity as 
did other diplomats who confirmed receiving the memorandum 
they said they contacted arab diplomats who told them they had 
not received any such notice 
officially arabs residing in iraq have rights equal to iraqi 
nationals in accordance with the panarab ideology of the ruling 
baath party 
the diplomats said that in september they received rations for 
distribution to their communities these included rice flour 
sugar tea and cooking oil items that had become sparse because 
of un sanctions 
the diplomats said they did not know how much foreigners would 
suffer after the latest decision because most people had 
stockpiled basics

thousands of vietnamese boat people will be 
encouraged to fly home voluntarily or face deportation under a 
major united nations policy switch diplomatic sources said 
wednesday 
they will offer the boat people dignity now or deportation 
later said a western diplomat who spoke on condition of 
anonymity 
the diplomat said it would be the first time un officials 
threatened deportation to boat people who often travel in 
overcrowded and unsafe vessels to reach the british colony 
previously un officials did not try to influence boat people 
and only accepted volunteers to return home 
about 54000 boat people remain in hong kong camps with 9000 
classified as refugees for resettlement in the west the other 
45000 are either waiting to be screened for determination of their 
status or have been classified as nonrefugees and set for 
repatriation 
jamshid anvar chief of the un high commissioner for refugees 
for asia and oceania informed diplomats of the new policy sources 
said 
britain vietnam and the united nations signed an agreement last 
week that says that in addition to volunteers boat people who 
did not oppose being sent back to vietnam would also be flown 
home 
an official at the un refugee office in hong kong confirmed 
the meeting took place but declined further comment and said anvar 
was not available 
under the agreement with britain and vietnam the united nations 
agreed to monitor returning boat people to ensure they do not face 
political persecution or unnecessary economic hardship 
anvar told the diplomats britain has given the new agreement 
about three months to succeed 
if it fails britain could begin forcible repatriation of boat 
people in 1991 anvar was quoted as saying 
the colonial government forced 51 boat people home in december 
but suspended the program after international condemnation 
in late july secretary of states james a baker iii told 
southeast asin nations the united states still opposed forced 
repatriation but could accept the new category of those who do 
not object 
so far 4349 vietnamese boat people have returned from hong 
kong under a voluntary repatriation program that began in march 
1989 with un support 
hong kong stopped automatically allowing boat people to stay in 
june 1988 since then more than 49400 have arrived including 
nearly 5000 this year

the white house claiming there was no 
justification for the recent runup in oil and gasoline prices 
announced wednesday that president bush had decided to sell 5 
million barrels of crude oil from the strategic petroleum reserve 
the decision to tap the nations oil reserve as a cannon shot 
against soaring prices was announced by white house spokesman 
marlin fitzwater 
fitzwater said the decision to put 5 million barrels on the 
market was a test and the president would take additional 
steps to stabilize energy prices 
the reserve contains 590 million barrels of crude oil it has 
never been used apart from a 1million barrel test sale in 1985 
that was not aimed at influencing prices 
fitzwater said he expected prices to decline under the 
governments sale but he did not say by how much prices have 
jumped to about 39 a barrel from 21 before iraqs invasion of 
kuwait 
fitzwater said bush was taking the action to head off those 
who might seek profit by subverting the sanctions against iraq 
there is sufficient oilto meet current needs fitzwater 
said oil markets have simply not taken into account additional 
production coming on stream 
industry experts have estimated that production in other 
countries has restored about twothirds of the 48 million daily 
barrels of oil production removed from world markets by iraqs 
takeover of kuwait on aug 2 and the world embargo against 
iraqikuwaiti oil 
the united states uses more than 17 million barrels a day about 
half of it imported 
fitzwater quoted bush as saying there was no justification for 
the intensive and unwarranted speculation in oil futures that has 
driven the price about 39 a barrel in the united states 
fitzwater said this was the first time that the oil reserves 
which have been held in salt domes along the texas and louisiana 
coasts have been tapped for usage since they were established in 
1975 
he offered no estimate of how much prices would decline as a 
result of the sales but he did say i would expect it would have 
a downward impact 
should the oil situation deteriorate fitzwater said the 
president was prepared to bring additional oil on the market 
from the reserve 
while insisting there is no oil shortage in the united states 
at this time fitzwater said this test is to make sure the 
system works 
the spokesman said frankly there is no way to justify 
price increases that sent oil soaring from 24 a barrel to 39 a 
barrel over the past week 
we need to make it clear that we do have oil available to put 
on the market fitzwater said 
in remarks prepared for a political fundraising dinner bush 
said his action was needed because it is especially important 
that america is economically healthy and militarily strong 
fitzwater said the president felt the move was especially 
important as the nation neared the heating oil season 
bush said bids would be taken by the energy department for oil 
and should be awarding contracts within 15 days and delivering oil 
in 15 to 30 days

more money is needed to educate 
smalltown doctors and their patients about aids a national panel 
on rural health said wednesday 
aids caught rural towns unprepared said robert a devries 
acting chairman of the national advisory committee on rural health 
there has been a sense that aids would not strike rural 
america he said weve now seen a 37 percent increase in the 
number of rural aids cases in one year compared to a 5 percent 
increase among urban populations he said citing us centers 
for disease control statistics for 198889 
i think we see a surprised relatively unprepared community of 
people said devries a program director for the wk kellogg 
foundation of battle creek mich 
the committee which advises health and human services secretary 
louis w sullivan ended a threeday meeting wednesday 
among the aidsrelated recommendations adopted by the panel were 
suggestions that the federal goverment fund studies to collect and 
distribute data on the incidence of acquired immune deficiency 
syndrom in rural areas 
other recommendations included a tollfree hot line to provide 
information on aids to the rural health care community 
people living in cities have had 10 years to learn about aids 
how to treat it and how to protect yourself from getting it said 
pat taylor a program analyst for office for rural health policy 
people in rural areas are just starting to learn 
some of the attitudes remind you of 50 60 or 70 years ago 
when people used to keep members of their family who were mentally 
ill in the attic taylor said 
the group also said an existing cdc program that provides 
information on social services and federal benefits for aids 
patients should be expanded 
its such an urbanorientated issue now said jerry coopey 
a senior analyst for the rural health policy office theres a 
great deal of money going for aids in places like chicago 
washington or new york but rural areas are being affected too we 
just want to get our fair share 
the recommendations will be reviewed before being submitted to 
sullivan at years end in the advisory committees annual report 
devries said 
the advisory group interviewed three aids patients including 
michael goff a 33yearold former social worker goff who was 
diagnosed with aids two years ago told the group that rural aids 
patients face challenges never considered by their city 
counterparts 
in this state i do see people who are so afraid of what the 
public is going to find out they dont get treatment or they do 
not seek benefits or they do not complain when they are 
discriminated against he said 
he said he formed a support group out of loneliness after his 
diagnosis

a republican political organization charged in 
a formal complaint wednesday that the campaign of rep frank 
annunzio failed to identify 20 contributors as officials and 
spouses of a gaithersburg md bank 
annunzio an illinois democrat called the accusations the 
product of my desperate opponent annunzio who has served 26 
years in the house is chairman of the house banking subcommittee 
on financial institutions and no 2 democrat on the full 
committee 
the chicago lawmaker faces republican state sen walter dudycz 
in november 
the complaint by the national republican congressional 
committee the political organization of house republicans was 
filed with the federal election commission 
us election law says a campaign treasurer must make a best 
effort to obtain the name address occupation and the employer 
of a contributor 
the complaint cited a sept 22 story by the national journal 
which said 20 of annunzios contributors were officials and spouses 
of standard federal savings bank of gaithersburg md 
the annunzio campaign the complaint said was able to obtain 
the name of the employer of every other individual who contributed 
during this period 
each of the 20 persons made two 200 contributions during 1990 
for a total of 8000 
mere probability makes it extremely unlikely that fully 
onefifth of those contributors could by coincidence both 
work for or be directly associated with a single institution and 
be the only 20 of one hundred for whom employers name was 
unavailable said the complaint 
annunzio said he has done nothing wrong 
i am prepared to go before any government body to answer 
any questions said annunzio i have nothing to hide 
the fec is obligated to launch a preliminary inquiry into any 
complaint not initiated by its own staff the election law sets 
maximum penalties of 10000 for willful election law violations 
and 5000 for less serious violations 
earlier this month after news stories appeared about the 
contributions annunzio said there was nothing wrong with the 
donations even though he was opposing a proposal that could have 
hurt the institution 
on march 28 annunzios subcommittee held a hearing on the 
federal deposit insurance corp proposal which involved mortgage 
servicing agreements the proposal would have adversely affected 
standards business the fdic dropped it after annunzios hearing 
which included testimony against the plan

bishop desmond tutu said wednesday that 
news reports misrepresent tribal violence in south africas black 
townships when they focus on the black on black angle 
the violence is mainly for political reasons over ideological 
political turf the antiapartheid activist said at brown 
university which presented him with an honorary degree 
were no more divided than any other normal community he 
said 
tutu wondered aloud why the strife in northern ireland wasnt 
characterized as white on white as the black on black 
violence is in south africa 
about 800 blacks have died since fighting began outside 
johannesburg in early august between the african national congress 
and inkatha both organizations oppose apartheid south africas 
policy of racial separation but differ on plans for the countrys 
future 
this is the frustration of people who have been deprived for 
so many years said tutu who won the nobel prize for peace in 
1984 for his work against apartheid the cost may be slightly 
higher than we thought 
tutu also questioned president fw de klerks commitment to his 
stated goal of one man one vote for south africa but he said 
de klerk who met with president bush on monday must be given 
considerable credit for his courage in trying to move the country 
away from apartheid 
but tutu said the world looks more to african national congress 
leader nelson mandela as south africas spiritual leader 
he contrasted the adulation given mandela when he visited the 
united states earlier this year with de klerks lowerprofile visit 
with bush on monday 
its as different as chalk and cheese he said 
tutu also reiterated his call to bush to retain economic 
sanctions against south africa 
it indicates whether you are on the side of the oppressed or 
the oppressor he said 
the president has indicated he might lift the sanctions if the 
government releases political prisoners and lifts the state of 
emergency in black townships 
the bishop also said he had no qualms about accepting honors 
from brown university which has 635000 invested in south africa 
tutu has turned down similar honors from schools that had south 
african investments 
but robert reichley browns vice president of university 
relations said brown has reduced its investments from 33 million 
in 1984 and half of the remaining 635000 is held by the school 
on behalf of others including alumni 
asked if that amount was significant tutu replied i would 
think that would be debating how many angels dance on the point of 
a needle

a usled task force met wednesday to discuss 
providing billions of dollars in economic assistance in the persian 
gulf crisis but failed to resolve several disputes that are 
plaguing the fundraising plan officials said 
the talks which involved more than 65 officials representing 
over 20 nations were held to launch the gulf crisis financial 
coordination group president bush announced formation of the group 
in a speech tuesday 
a senior us treasury official who briefed reporters after the 
meeting ended said the countries were in strong agreement that 
economic assistance to seriously affected countries was a critical 
element in the campaign to isolate iraqi president saddam hussein 
however he conceded that the organizational session adjourned 
without resolving such key issues as how much money would be needed 
or even which countries would qualify for the funds 
the issue of how much each donor country would be asked to 
contribute was also left undecided said the official who spoke on 
condition of anonymity 
it was not our purpose at this first meeting to settle 
numbers he said the purpose of this meeting was to try to 
reach agreement on certain issues dealing with process and 
procedure 
the official said a working group of lowerlevel officials 
headed by assistant treasury secretary charles dallara would meet 
again within a few days to lay the groundwork for resolving some of 
the outstanding issues at a second meeting of the coordinating 
group scheduled for oct 12 
the october meeting will be chaired by treasury undersecretary 
david c mulford 
bush unveiled the coordinating group in a speech at the opening 
session of the imfworld bank meetings saying the informal panel 
was needed to organize the fundraising effort 
cees maas deputy finance minister of the netherlands who 
participated in the discussions said the group agreed on the goals 
but that there were no specific commitments made on amounts to be 
donated 
we agreed that this has to be done quickly and that 
coordination is necessary he said 
before the meeting began british chancellor of the exchequer 
john major said he had heard figures ranging from 8 billion to 18 
billion for the amount of money being sought 
us officials however put the american request in a more 
narrow range of 13 billion to 15 billion some european countries 
contend that this amount is too high and should be scaled back to 
about 9 billion 
the us plan would target the assistance to egypt jordan and 
turkey the administration fears that without substantial aid the 
resolve of those key frontline states to support the campaign 
against iraq might crumble 
however saudi arabia and kuwait reportedly objected to the 
inclusion of jordan in the aid package both countries have 
criticized jordan for being reluctant to support the un trade 
embargo against iraq 
the us official who briefed reporters said the issue of aid to 
jordan was not resolved at the meeting 
he said some countries are pushing on the other side to expand 
the definition of frontline states to include countries other than 
egypt jordan and turkey that issue was also left unresolved he 
said 
for his part japanese finance minister ryutaro hashimoto 
stressed that the proposed assistance package drawn up by the 
united states should be viewed only as a starting point for 
discussions and the final details would come only after donor 
nations had time to review the proposal 
japan has already pledged 2 billion for the economic assistance 
package and another 2 billion to support the us military buildup 
in the mideast 
publicly no finance minister was willing to criticize the 
makeup of the usproposed steering committee which will have 
both its chairman and vice chairman come from the administration 
brady will serve as chairman and his deputy will named by the state 
department 
the world bank and the imf were to supply technical support 
both agencies have pledged to supply billions of dollars from 
their own resources to help cushion the shock to poor nations from 
the doubling in world oil prices and other economic fallouts such 
as a flood of refugees from kuwait and iraq 
in a speech to the imfworld bank annual meeting wednesday 
brady appealed for a united economic front against saddam 
the economic strength represented by all of you in this room 
must be mobilized to demonstrate collective resolve and make clear 
our intention not to yield to aggression he said 
the nations participating with the united states in the crisis 
coordinating group included japan west germany britain france 
canada italy saudi arabia kuwait the united arab emirates 
qatar and south korea 
the group also was to include representatives from the 12nation 
european community and the gulf cooperation council of persian gulf

police patrols have been increased 
where five slayings occurred in this college town reportedly 
after laboratory tests failed to link evidence with anyone on the 
list of suspects 
the gainesville sun said its uncertain whether the test results 
actually cleared any suspects in the stabbing deaths or if they 
just failed to support existing suspicions 
sgt dick gerard a spokesman for the 150member joint task 
force investigating the slayings refused to say whether any of the 
lab results pointed to a specific suspect or cleared any suspect 
we will not discuss any piece of evidence gerard said 
wednesday 
he said analysis of evidence is continuing and it may be four to 
six months before all the lab work is completed 
police are still interested in two identified suspects edward 
lewis humphrey and stephen michael bates gerard said both are 
jailed on unrelated charges and neither has been charged in the 
gainesville deaths 
mr humphrey is one of the individuals we are looking at 
said gerard who repeated the same sentence inserting bates name 
the spokesman said he doesnt use the word suspect when discussing 
the case 
earlier police said they had a pool of eight suspects gerard 
said the pool fluctates daily and could be as high as 30 or 40 
since the slayings in late august police have frequently 
cautioned that the killer may still be roaming the streets of 
gainesville four of the victims attended the university of 
florida one was a student at the citys santa fe community 
college 
police declined to comment on the newspapers report wednesday 
that patrols in southwest gainesville were increased in part 
because crime lab results did not implicate a suspect 
the newspaper quoted unidentified law enforcement sources and 
also cited the apparent failure of intense searches of woods 
frequented by humphrey an 18yearold freshman at the university 
for the increased patrols 
we are continuing to urge students and others to be extemely 
careful since arrests have not been made and no charges have been 
filed we should assume that this is not solved in any way said 
art sandeen vice president for student affairs at the university 
of florida

the senate voted wednesday to require 
federally supported family planning clinics to notify parents of 
teenage girls who seek abortions 
the action came on an amendment to a bill renewing federal 
familyplanning assistance which emerged as the latest 
battleground in the political war over abortion 
the bill was already under a veto threat however and the vote 
was one in a series of conflicting and confusing senate actions 
that left the bill facing an uncertain future 
a vote to limit debate fell 10 short of the necessary 60 votes 
diminishing prospects of any further action on the bill itself 
the senate approved by a large margin another amendment tuesday 
evening that would nullify bush administration regulations 
prohibiting the family planning clinics from offering any 
information or counseling involving abortion 
the result was a senate bill that contained provisions pushed by 
both antiabortion and abortionrights forces 
in the house meanwhile a similar version extending the life 
of family planning services provided through title x of the public 
health service act of 1970 was approved by the energy and commerce 
committee without any of the controversial senate provisions on 
abortion the clinics offer family planning and health services to 
the poor 
rep henry waxman dcalif subcommittee chairman and an 
abortionrights advocate said he would push for enactment of a 
bill without the senates abortion provisions as a way to avoid a 
presidential veto 
i think our best chance to reauthorize title x is to send a 
simple continuation of the program waxman said 
the family planning acts authorization expired in 1985 but 
services have been funded by congress each year since then through 
socalled continuing resolutions or catchall spending measures 
sen edward kennedy dmass the bills sponsor said the 
action on parental notification means the senate turns our back 
on millions of teenagers but sen orrin hatch rutah 
suggested democrats had only pushed the bill to force president 
bushs veto and said the services would again be funded regardless 
of the bills outcome 
nobody is going to be denied those funds hatch said 
the senate accepted the parental notification amendment offered 
by sen william armstrong rcolo on a unanimous voice vote after 
narrowly defeating a motion to table or kill the amendment that 
key vote against tabling was 5443 
the requirement for parental notification applies only to 
organizations that receive federal money to provide family planning 
services to the poor in cases where girls under age 18 seek 
abortions 
those organizations are prohibited from using federal money for 
abortions but armstrong said more than 30 perform abortions at the 
same clinic that provides federally supported family planning 
services 
in almost every jurisdiction you have to have the permission 
of your parent to give blood armstrong said but there is 
a surgical procedure for which that is not required and it is 
abortion 
armstrong was thwarted in his first attempt to offer the 
amendment tuesday evening sen edward kennedy dmass used 
parliamentary means to block a direct vote on armstrongs 
amendment but on wednesday armstrong succeeded in attaching his 
language to an unrelated amendment 
there are no funds no funds whatsoever that are involved in 
abortion kennedy said referring to federal money 
the senates vote tuesday night to nullify the administrations 
prohibition on abortion counseling provided abortionrights 
advocates with a surprisingly large 62vote majority 
senate minority leader bob dole rkan an abortion opponent 
voted with abortionrights advocates in support of the amendment 
producing an initial 6335 vote but more than an hour after the 
vote was taken dole asked that his recorded vote be changed to 
no 
dole who arrived late for the vote simply made a mistake said 
his press secretary walt riker 
he just made a mistake when he voted riker said 
doug johnson lobbyist for the antiabortion national right to 
life committee said he had expected to lose by about a 6040 vote 
there were a couple of guys who screwed up and were 
confused johnson said that didnt help having the 
republican leader confused

students upset over the acquisition of a 
controversial sculpture and other matters took over two buildings 
at the university of the district of columbia on wednesday and 
demanded a meeting with the board of trustees and the mayor 
the students also are demanding removal by mayor marion barry of 
11 of the 15 trustees according to mark thompson spokesman for 
the student group 
thompson said some issues have been neglected by the board we 
need to get rid of the board of trustees he said 
barry was very sympathetic and in fact emphatic with our 
demands thompson said 
a barry spokeswoman said the mayor was waiting to see whether 
the students and university officials can work out an agreement 
the mayor is not going to get involved at this time barry 
spokeswoman lurma rackley said he wants to see if they can reach 
some kind of accommodation he is watching the situation closely 
however 
the 200 demonstrators took over the main administration building 
and a nearby building housing the university radio station 
bookstore and several offices and classrooms 
they met briefly with interim president miles fisher iv in his 
office and agreed to leave the third floor of the building after 
officials said they could remain on the first two floors 
university spokesman john britton said the takeover was 
peaceful thompson said students had no desire to brutalize our 
beautiful institution 
thompson said the demonstration had the support of a majority of 
students on the campus we are a strong unified group if they 
other students are not inside with us they are outside 
supporting us 
evening classes were cancelled on the main campus but classes 
were scheduled for the mount vernon square campus several miles 
away downtown and officials were trying to get in touch with the 
15 trustees britton said the students turned down a chance to 
meet with the chairwoman of the trustees nina hardon long 
it was too late its tragic she had to wait until something 
like this happened to call a meeting he said 
the students had sent a list of 20 demands to the board on 
monday including one calling for the resignation of ms long and 
two board colleagues 
ms long was instrumental in acquiring the dinner party by 
feminist artist judy chicago a ceramic sculpture depicting the 
history of women in 39 dinner table settings many containing a 
representation of female genitalia 
the students protested that the acquisition threatened student 
and other university programs since the house of representatives 
voted to reduce the universitys operating budget by the 16 
million the board voted to spend in renovating a library to house 
the work 
the senate did not make a similar reduction and a conference 
committee will have to produce a reconciliation of the two 
versions 
no university money was spent on the sculpture itself which was 
a donation 
students had also said earlier they were upset with high 
turnover in the faculty and top administration and that they had 
no voice in the decisions made by the trustees

saudi defensive requirements in the standoff with iraq the sources 
said 
weapons which will take longer to deliver or which meet future 
saudi force needs such as f15f fighter planes will be in the 
package bush will send to congress in january they said 
the administration split the arms sale into two parts after 
supporters of israel on capitol hill complained that the original 
request for some 21 billion in weaponry was too large and was 
being pushed through too quickly 
rep mel levine dcalif a staunch supporter of israel said 
informal assurances he had received led him to believe the new 
package would pass congressional muster 
this is a significant improvement over the original 21 
billion package proposed by the administration levine said this 
is what should have been proposed in the first place 
levine said lawmakers concerned about israels security support 
bushs military moves to counter iraqs aug 2 invasion of kuwait 
but the earlier larger arms sale proposal appeared to be an 
attempt to use the crisis as justification for sending items not 
needed for the crisis levine said 
at the same time the administration has been discussing a new 
package of military aid to israel and senior officials have 
promised to maintain israels qualitative military advantage over 
neighboring states 
israels backers said that they expect little objection in 
congress to the administrations new proposal because of strong 
bipartisan support for president bushs policy in the middle east 
and saudi arabias clear defensive needs

a small group wednesday marked one month of a 
roundtheclock peace vigil and pledged to stay at the city park 
until the persian gulf crisis is peacefully resolved 
the peaceworks park vigil began spontaneously aug 26 when 
activists attending a peaceoriented concert at gas works park 
decided they had to do something about the heightening tensions in 
the middle east 
the group of 20 agreed to keep up the 24hour vigil even if it 
meant sacrificing work and family life and giving up the amenities 
of indoor living 
the reason were still here is that the situation in the gulf 
today is just as bad as what motivated us to start the vigil in the 
first place said joseph mabel one of the spokesmen for the 
group 
the vigilists as they call themselves say the group has 
numbered as high as 240 and as low as two or three at any one time 
participants trade shifts and they say there has always been 
someone present 
the group discussed how to prevent hangerson from diverting the 
purpose of the vigil and how to keep members participating when 
winter weather comes 
visitors to the popular park on seattles lake union pass by a 
makeshift camp with rugs recycling bins bicycles canned foods 
and a small library of peaceoriented books 
the group is united in a call for an end to us military 
involvement in the persian gulf but beyond that statement each 
participant speaks individually 
however most share the belief that the bush administration has 
sent us troops to the region for cheap oil rather than for any 
lofty ideal such as creating a stable world order 
vivian mcpeak compares the us policy to that of a junkie 
ready to fight anyone for his next fix 
added karen hill this is a war of businessmen and bankers 
but businessmen and bankers are never the casualties 
some in the group call themselves pacifists but not john hatch 
who recently left the military after seven years of service 
i personally wouldnt mind if the us cleaned saddam 
husseins clock and got out of there hatch said 
but he said he doesnt believe thats possible and fears the 
united states will become bogged down in a long bloody war 
hatch who decided to quit his job as a janitor to participate 
said the groups number is increasing as passersby learn of the 
vigil and join up 
one of the visitors wednesday was former rep mike lowry 
dwash who lost a senate race after 10 years in congress before 
becoming a seattle university professor of political science 
we need to be asking ourselves is it worth it to send our 
young people off to die for cheap oil lowry said there are 
things worth going to war over to go to war over oil is wrong

the diplomatic war in the persian gulf 
escalated on another front wednesday between jordan and saudi 
arabia jordanian newspapers called saudi officials warmongers 
who outdid israel and the west in acting against arab interests 
the newspapers were reacting to saudi arabias cutting off oil 
supplies to jordan and expelling more than 30 jordanian embassy 
employees on charges of spying for iraq 
officials in amman sought to play down the division hoping it 
will heal but many jordanians expressed bitterness and defiance 
let them drink their oil we do not need them said ali 
tobassi a jordanian waiting at a bus stand tuesday we will 
sweat to earn our daily bread and we prefer to starve rather than 
take their money 
jordans arabiclanguage daily alrai said the saudis seem to 
consider opposition to foreign troops in the gulf to be directed at 
them and sought to punish us in terms of halting oil supplies and 
accusing our embassy staff of espionage 
this means the sister state of saudi arabia has virtually 
decided to declare a real war against the jordanian and palestinian 
people it said 
a multinational military force including tens of thousands of 
us troops has assembled in the saudi desert following iraqs 
blitz takeover on aug 2 of the small oil sultanate of kuwait 
adjoining saudi arabia jordan has supported iraqi president saddam 
hussein in the confrontation but said wednesday it will halt all 
flights to and from iraq to comply with a un air embargo 
jordans conservative arabiclanguage addustour was 
particularly incensed by remarks tuesday by saudi foreign minister 
prince saud alfaisal that force was the sole option for getting 
iraq out of kuwait 
it said in a frontpage editorial saud alfaisal has outdone 
the warmongers of israel britain and even the united states in 
their campaign against iraq 
saudi arabia ordered 20 jordanian diplomatic personnel out of 
the country on saturday and 12 more on tuesday jordan indignantly 
reported the move on national radio and recalled its ambassador in 
protest 
saudi arabia took the measures to express outrage over jordans 
proiraqi stance and at what it saw as jordanian attempts to 
undermine its government 
prince bandar bin sultan alsaud the saudi ambassador in 
washington wrote an open letter to jordans king hussein deploring 
what he called a defense of iraqs horrifying acts of rape and 
destruction in kuwait 
jordanian officials chose their words carefully in response 
we do not understand why our brethren in saudi arabia are 
lashing out at us said one senior official i am sure that 
this is a misunderstanding which will be sorted out and i hope that 
will be soon 
i am sure all these differences will be solved said a 
senior foreign ministry official who like the other official 
spoke on condition of anonymity 
he denied that jordanian officials in saudi arabia had spied on 
military installations 
western diplomatic sources speaking privately said evidence 
existed that some jordanian embassy employees acted individually on 
behalf of iraq without the knowledge or permission of their 
government 
some officials in amman first refused to acknowledge that saudi 
arabia long a source of huge monetary grants to jordan had 
actually expelled jordanians 
but the reduction of jordans diplomatic staff to eight drove 
amman authorities to going public 
jordan recalled ambassador naser batayneh to protest such a 
saudi action which is seen as inexcusable said a foreign 
ministry statement read on the official jordan radio 
the saudis appeared especially angered over a proiraqi 
conference in amman last week that urged the overthrow of oilrich 
arab rulers and attacked riyadh for allowing deployment of western 
forces to protect it against possible iraqi aggression 
last week saudi arabia cut off oil supplies to jordan claiming 
jordan owed 46 million in oil payments jordan denied it 
the conservative englishlanguage daily jordan times declared 
jordanians cannot be perplexed by these saudi actions be 
that as it may jordan will not give in and will continue to 
advocate its beliefs that what is going on in the arabian peninsula 
and around it is extremely dangerous particularly to saudi 
interests and the arab people at large

the soviet legislature formally ended decades of 
religious repression on wednesday giving overwhelming initial 
approval to a law on freedom of conscience at a time when soviets 
are flocking to churches in record numbers 
our people suffered to get this law said mikhail kulakov a 
leader of the soviet unions seventh day adventists who have been 
persecuted for evangelical activities 
the law forbids the government from interfering with religious 
activities improves the legal status of religious organizations 
and gives soviet citizens the right to study religion in homes and 
in private schools 
the soviet constitution has long guaranteed freedom of worship 
but in the past the communist partys ideological opposition to 
religion as the opiate of the masses made that guarantee 
hollow 
in practice the government discouraged religious services 
closed churches and synagogues imprisoned religious leaders and 
preached atheism 
the most important thing for us is not only that the law is 
passed but that it begins to work said adolph shayevich 
moscows chief rabbi 
peter reddaway an expert on soviet religion at george 
washington university in washington said in a telephone interview 
there is reason for optimism the law will be respected 
he noted that official tolerance for religion has increased 
since president mikhail s gorbachev came to power in 1985 
gorbachevs mother is a practicing member of the russian orthodox 
church and last year he acknowledged he was baptized as a child 
the authorities have been loosening restrictions for a couple 
of years and now theyre putting it in writing reddaway said 
he said western experts estimate that a quarter of the 285 
million soviet people practice religion and the number is rising 
fast 
among signs of religious revival are increasing numbers of 
seminarians and the reopening of churches that were used as 
storehouses garages and even factories 
three years ago gorbachev held talks with the head of the 
russian orthodox church the first such meeting in more than 40 
years in december he met pope john paul ii at the vatican 
bibles are no longer confiscated at soviet borders holiday 
church services are shown on television and religious publications 
are flourishing 
on sunday a divine liturgy was held in the kremlins uspensky 
cathedral the first full service allowed in russias most 
important cathedral since 1918 
jews are also enjoying greater religious autonomy including 
freedom to study hebrew which previously had been suppressed 
the ukrainian catholic church outlawed by josef stalin in 1947 
has come out from underground and reclaimed some of its property 
under the new law it can apply to local authorities to regain 
lawful status 
in soviet central asia where moslems predominate attendance at 
mosques has risen and copies of the koran are in heavy demand 
the new law which passed 3411 with one abstention says the 
government will not restrict the study financing or 
propagandizing of religion it was not a roll call vote and the 
identity of the person who abstained was not known 
atheism remains the doctrine of the communist party but the law 
prohibits the government from funding either religious activities 
or atheist propaganda 
it allows religious groups to set up societies and send people 
abroad for spiritual study 
in the past religious organizations had no clear legal standing 
and were unable to makecontracts or represent themselves in court 
under the new law they have the same status as individual 
citizens 
but a clause allowing public schools to be used for religious 
classes after regular hours set off a fierce debate and was 
defeated by one chamber of the legislature 
while the bill was easily passed into law a legislative 
committee is scheduled to go into session on monday to settle 
provisions still in dispute principally the public school issue 
and taxation of donations to religious organizations 
patriarch alexi ii head of the russian orthodox church urged 
the legislature to ensure that government officials do not come 
between the church and the people 
the russian church has already experienced attempts on a 
political basis to destroy the unity of religious life said the 
patriarch who wore a black robe and majestic white headdress 
topped with a gold cross 
shortly after the 1917 revolution many priests were shot and 
the bolsheviks began an antireligious propaganda campaign 
during world war ii stalin revived the church to help lift 
morale and patriotism 
but in the 1950s premier nikita khrushchev undertook a major 
antireligion campaign closing approximately twothirds of the 
orthodox churches seven out of 10 seminaries and the majority of 
monasteries 
khrushchevs ouster in 1964 ended the campaign but there was no 
significant restoration of church property or religious rights 
under his successor leonid brezhnev 
reddaway said the soviet union has about 50 million moslems 30 
million russian orthodox believers 6 million catholics 2 million 
jews and 1 million baptists but he said the percentage of moslems 
who practice their faith is uncertain

supporters of voter initiatives wednesday 
blamed calculating opponents and bungling bureaucrats for a court 
ruling that threw five of the measures off the ballot 
a judge monday tossed five of the 11 statewide initiative 
measures off the nov 6 ballot because of a technicality the state 
is appealing the decision one of the measures would have allowed 
tax credits for parents who send their children to parochial 
schools 
jim andersen canvassing director of oregon state public 
interest research group said oregonians overwhelmingly favor his 
groups initiative to ban some nonrecyclable packaging 
now because of bureaucratic inefficiency and a wellorganized 
and powerful opposition hundreds of thousands of peoples votes 
across the state will have no value and thats not right he said 
at a rally 
he noted that oregon was the first state to implement the 
initiative process 88 years ago whereby voters can get issues on 
the ballot by petition 
marion county circuit judge richard barber ruled the measures 
invalid monday because they dont contain statements on their 
estimated financial effects the statements werent included 
because of an earlier court ruling saying state officials missed a 
deadline for formally approving them 
opponents of the measures argued it was illegal to allow them to 
appear on the ballot without the financial statements 
another ballot measure invalidated by the ruling would shut down 
oregons only nuclear power plant about 40 miles northwest of 
portland until waste disposal requirements are met 
antinuclear activist lloyd marbet told the rally that trojan 
nuclear plant operator portland general electric co perpetrated a 
clear manipulation of the political rights of this state when 
it participated in the attempt to have the measures invalidated 
a spokesman for the utility steve sautter has said the company 
feels it is important for voters to know the economic impact of 
shutting down the plant 
other measures affected by the ruling would limit property taxes 
to 15 percent of value and establish a jobs program for welfare 
recipients 
the education measure would have allowed tax credits of up to 
2500 a year each for pupils at private schools including 
churchsupported schools and for children taught at home 
backers of that measure didnt attend the rally which drew just 
a few dozen people 
in salem a spokesman for house speaker vera katz said wednesday 
a special legislative session is among options being considered to 
get the measures back on the ballot if the ruling stands 
were absolutely not at this point pushing for a special 
session said the spokesman dan field we certainly hope this 
thing will be resolved in the courts if its not the legislature 
should be prepared to consider all options that may or may not 
include a special session 
the legislature would have authority to refer the measures to 
the ballot or could pass a law saying the measures will be on th 
ballot despite the foulup

the spiritual leader of tibet said wednesday the 
international outrage following iraqs invasion of kuwait is absent 
with the chinese occupation of his mountainous homeland because it 
lacks oil 
there are also some big differences between 40 years ago and

gulf crisis had happened a few years ago the situation would be 
different

of sheet steel worth about 18 million from a vessel off thailand 
abhy ankar information officer of the international maritime 
bureau said pirates in southeast asia are definitely becoming 
more professional in this case they were very wellprepared

8 24 hours after it left bangkok for busan south korea with a 
cargo of steel 
he gave this account 
four attackers with pistols and metal bars began firing on the 
ship at around midnight they seized control and handcuffed the

name to vtai they replaced the cypriot flag with one of a 
different nationality 
the pirates told the crew dutch captain two european officers 
and four filipino ratings their lives would be spared the ship 
then off the thaicambodian coast kept south for two days until it 
reached a prearranged position 
the crew then was locked in a cabin and the cargo was unloaded 
into what the crew believed was a motorized barge or small vessel 
the pirates stayed aboard forcing the crew to sail toward 
bangkok after two days the pirates took a lifeboat and supplies 
drugged the captain and took him hostage and destroyed the martas 
communication equipment 
the rest of the crew were told to sail to bangkok 
the marta went aground near bangkok harbor and a thai naval 
patrol vessel picked up the crew the pirates later handed the

outside a courthouse wednesday after accusing prosecutors of 
hounding his ailing daughter to testify at her brothers murder 
trial

firstdegree murder charge against his son christian the younger

the united states and the soviet union were 
unable wednesday to iron out their differences on unfinished 
treaties to reduce conventional and longrange nuclear weapons 
but the soviets hinted at progress and another round of 
highlevel talks was set tentatively for thursday afternoon 
were at a point where the issues are rather technical a 
senior us official said 
failure to reach agreement on the accords could force 
postponement of a 34nation summit meeting in paris in 
midnovember interrupt the easing of eastwest tensions in europe 
and delay a trip to moscow in december by president bush 
the pivotal talks were held by secretary of state james a baker 
iii and soviet foreign minister eduard a shevardnadze in a 
midtown hotel about a mile from the united nations where they 
voted on tuesday to impose an embargo on cargo shipments by air to 
iraq and occupied kuwait 
the aim is to force iraq to withdraw from the oilrich emirate 
in the persian gulf which it seized aug 2 sending tremors 
through world oil markets and touching off hoarding and price 
rises 
on quite a few questions there is progress shevardnadze 
said at the conclusion of the meeting which took nearly four 
hours he did not specify which questions he had in mind 
but in order to carry these thru to the end well have to meet 
again he said 
the senior us official who briefed reporters later under rules 
that shielded his identity said baker and shevardnadze had 
recommitted themselves to completing the two treaties by the end of 
the year 
he said they laid out some ideas which he declined to 
describe and would take them up again at their second meeting 
asked if any of the remaining issues had been resolved the 
official replied they are still unsettled 
in a drive to complete the treaties us and soviet negotiators 
met separately from baker and shevardnadze continuing discussions 
they began last week in washington 
the soviet group is headed by viktor p karpov a deputy prime 
minister and veteran arms specialist and the us delegation by 
under secretary of state reginald bartholomew 
shevardnadze suggested a lot of work remains to be done there 
are so many problems he told reporters through a russian 
translator 
baker said they also dealt a good bit with cooperation at 
the united nations and added we ran out of time quite 
frankly 
at the united nations the two superpowers are working in tandem 
to tighten the economic screws on iraq by denying the president 
saddam husseins government all trade except for humanitarian food 
supplies 
a senior us official briefing reporters on condition of 
anonymity said the soviets had backed away from any attempt to link 
the persian gulf crisis to other area problems such as the 
arabisraeli dispute and the future of the israelioccupied 
territories 
also he said the soviets want to give a new impetus to the 
proliferation issue and agreed to work more closely with the 
united states once the gulf crisis is over to halt the 
proliferation of nuclear and chemical warfare technologies in the 
region 
baker began the meeting thanking shevardnadze for a strong 
speech at the united nations on tuesday condemning saddam and for 
the way the soviet foreign minister chaired the security council 
session 
shevardnadze said he was operating under a directive from 
soviet president mikhail s gorbachev to break the deadlock in the 
negotiations over reducing nonnuclear arsenals in europe 
he said the two sides had to find a solution 
two weeks ago when baker was in moscow they decided to 
jettison any attempt to limit the size of us and soviet troop 
concentrations in europe under the treaty 
they also considered abandoning limits on nonnuclear aircraft 
as well but deferred a decision 
the question is whether all landbased aircraft should be 
included as the united states proposed or whether planes the 
soviets say have defensive missions should be exempted from 
restrictions 
another unresolved issue is whether any single member of nato or 
the warsaw pact should hold no more than 30 percent of permitted 
weapons as the bush administration proposes or be allowed up to 
40 percent as moscow favors 
also the two sides have not agreed on verification procedures 
last week r james woolsey the chief american negotiator said 
the united states would seek postponement of the nov 19 paris 
meeting if agreement was not reached on a draft treaty in time 
its hanging in the balance woolsey said in brussels 
he said once a draft was ready the negotiators would need four 
to six weeks to translate about 200 pages of text and another 200 
pages of data into six languages 
we cant wait until midnight on nov 18 to decide things he 
said 
the treaty would impose ceilings on tanks antiaircraft 
artillery helicopters and armored personnel carriers 
negotiations between the north atlantic treaty organizations 16 
members and the sevennation warsaw pact began in february 1989 
after more than 15 years of negotiations on a similar accord ended 
in failure 
east germany where some 350000 soviet troops are stationed 
dropped out of the warsaw pact on monday and will merge with west 
germany a nato member on oct 3 the oviets have agreed to 
withdraw the troops in phases 
bush predicted in may 1989 that the new treaty would be 
concluded within six months to a year 
also lagging is a treaty to reduce by about 30 percent us and 
soviet stockpiles of longrange nuclear missiles bombers and 
submarines 
bush hopes to sign the treaty at a moscow summit with gorbachev 
in december 
but three key issues are unsettled they are 
the kinds of restrictions to impose on the 154 heavy 
groundbased ss18 intercontinental missiles the soviets will 
retain under the treaty 
whether the soviet backfire bomber is to be classified as a 
strategic weapon and counted against the bombers the soviets can 
retain under the treaty 
the restrictions to be imposed on us and soviet transfers of 
weapons barred under the treaty to allies from the united states 
to britain for instance

three iraqi passenger planes landed in jordan on wednesday but 
jordan said later it will halt all flights to and from iraq to 
comply with a un air embargo iraq accused washington of bribing 
moscow to back the un sanctions 
new threats meanwhile emerged against foreigners in iraq and 
kuwait diplomats in baghdad said the government told their 
missions it will no longer provide food rations for distribution to 
their communities as of monday 
they said an iraqi memorandum sent to all nonarab missions 
blamed the air embargo imposed tuesday saying it was expected to 
create major food shortages iraq imports about threequarters of 
its food 
about 1000 americans and 5000 other westerners are among tens 
of thousands of nonarab foreigners stranded by iraqs aug 2 
invasion of the oilrich sultanate 
us secretary of state james a baker iii said in new york on 
wednesday that iraq has threatened the death penalty for anyone 
hiding foreigners in diplomatic embassies he said he rejected the 
threat as repugnant and also rejected an iraqi demand for names 
of people given sanctuary in the embassies in baghdad and kuwait 
baker said the iraqi note was delivered to the us embassy in 
baghdad 
in washington iraqi ambassador mohamed almashat denied 
wednesday night that iraqi officials made any such threats 
in a sign that un sanctions are hurting iraqis baghdad 
announced wednesday it would extend rationing to rice flour and 
cooking oil 
the west was also feeling the economic impact of the crisis oil 
prices have jumped to about 39 a barrel from 21 before the 
invasion 
saying no justification existed for the runup in oil and 
gasoline prices the white house announced president bush had 
decided to sell 5 million of the 590 million barrels of crude oil 
in the strategic petroleum reserve 
earlier wednesday in washington irans minister of economic 
affairs and finance mohsen nourbakhsh asked nations with huge oil 
stockpiles to help restore stability to oil markets by tapping 
their strategic reserves but bush was not acting in response to 
that request 
the united states reportedly planned a show of force by 
sending its first aircraft carrier into the persian gulf in 16 
years and defense secretary dick cheney warned that an iraqi 
military strike was increasingly likely 
cheney told a conference of business economists in washington 
the bush administration had foreseen a key danger point in the 
standoff with president saddam hussein would arise once sanctions 
began crippling iraqs economy 
we may have seen in the last 48 or 72 hours the beginning 
commentary from him that would indicate that the sanctions are 
beginning to bite he said 
congressional and administration sources speaking on condition 
of anonymity said bush has decided to sell 75 billion in new 
weaponry to saudi arabia in immediate response to the crisis and 
to ask congress consent for another 14 billion next year 
about 165000 us soldiers are stationed in the saudi desert 
and aboard ships in the region thousands of arab and european 
troops have also been deployed as part of the usled 
multinational force assembled to deter any iraqi thrust against 
saudi arabia and its vast oil holdings 
us officials encountered reservations wednesday by allies on a 
fundraising campaign to collect the billions of dollars needed in 
the gulf crisis representatives of some of the 20 american allies 
met in washington 
a west german official said some european countries questioned 
whether a new us goal of 145 billion in aid for nations facing 
iraq overstated the need saudi officials questioned whether 
jordan criticized for being reluctant to oppose saddam should get 
aid 
the new air embargo was tested wednesday by the iraqi landings 
in amman jordan 
passengers aboard the regularly scheduled iraqi airways flights 
landing there included nine expelled french diplomats and 11 
britons stranded by the invasion it was not known what the cargo 
holds contained the planes all returned to baghdad 
jordanian officials first said the passenger aircraft were not 
included in embago resolution passed tuesday by the un security 
council 
but foreign minister marwan kasim later said in new york in a 
statement at un headquarters that jordan would comply fully with 
the embargo and halt passenger flights to and from iraq including 
freedom flights for westerners 
baghdads official news agency accused moscow a former ally 
of being bribed by the united states and gulf sheiks to oppose 
iraq it said the tone of a tough un speech tuesday by soviet 
foreign minister eduard shevardnadze clearly shows the bribe 
given by american and its allies the oil sheiks 
iraqi officials announced new food rationing will begin this 
weekend trade and finance minister mohammed mahdi saleh said sugar 
and tea also will be affected by the new restrictions the 
government already closed fast food restaurants and many pastry 
shops because they use large amounts of sugar 
bakeries still open make only bread which has been rationed 
since sept 1 
the security council already has authorized military enforcement 
of a sea embargo the air embargo is largely symbolic since most 
trade with iraq is by land and has already been halted iraqs only 
major export is oil 
also on wednesday 
cheney ordered 40000 troops removed from europe within a year 
to respond to declining defense budgets the decision has no direct 
connection to the us deployments in the gulf area 
us military sources in the gulf said the carrier independence 
was expected to sail into the gulf within the next few days 
bringing it within 500 miles of iraq the carrier with 70 attack 
jets would be the first such us warship in the gulf in 16 years 
a carrierbased sh3h sea king helicopter carrying 17 sailors 
ditched in the red sea during a training exercise but all were 
rescued unhurt the navy said the copter sank after landing about 
5000 yards from the carrier john f kennedy it said 
us marines defending saudi oilfields were told by their 
commander to expect a long desert stay gen alfred gray also said 
the marines should be prepared to shift to offense if saudi arabia 
is attacked 
in washington state department spokesman richard boucher said 
iraq had rounded up at least seven more americans bringing to 
about 100 the number being detained many have been taken to 
military and industrial complexes to deter a potential us 
military attack 
about 1000 americans remain in kuwait and iraq denied 
permission by iraq to return to the united states

the x rating was eliminated wednesday by the 
motion picture association of america in favor of a new nc17 
rating that bars children but does not carry the commercial stigma 
of the x 
filmmakers hope the new rating effective immediately will 
carry none of the advertising and exhibition restraints that an x 
rating guaranteed they maintain that the x rating had become 
synonymous with hardcore pornography and served no purpose in 
evaluating artistic films best suited for adults 
the r rating which bars unaccompanied minors from certain 
films remains intact as does the pg13 pg and g ratings 
its a great step said philip kaufman director of the 
xrated universal pictures film henry amp june the historical 
drama which features some explicit sex was set for a ratings 
appeal next week and will be the first recipient of the new nc 
rating which would bar children under age 17 
im just really delighted that we can show this film uncut in 
america and show the film the way i made it kaufman said it 
is not intended as a prurient film 
the old x rating meant no children under 17 allowed but states 
had the option to set a higher age cutoff under nc17 states 
also will have that option says william kartozian president of 
the national association of theater owners who predicted that a 
few will raise the rating to nc18 
it was unclear whether newspapers and television and radio 
stations which tend to reject advertisements for xrated films 
would be more inclined to carry ads for movies bearing the nc17 
mark 
the new rating will be copyrighted the mpaa said at a new york 
news conference the x rating was not and is used widely by the 
adult movie industry 
films that got an x rating from the mpaa will be switched to 
nc17 at the request of the films owner 
the new nc17 rating cannot be used by porno producers unless 
they submit their films to the mpaa for review which they never do 
because it costs money 
most theater chains refuse to show xrated films regardless of 
artistic merits 
kartozian predicted most of those theaters will show nc17 
movies 
for months a variety of directors and film producers have 
sought a change in the ratings system 
other xrated films aimed at mainstream moviegoers included 
hardware frankenhooker henry portrait of a serial 
killer and life is cheap but toilet paper is expensive 
the announcement marks a significant aboutface by the mpaa its 
president jack valenti had maintained during months of complaints 
that the procedure worked 
its fair to say weve received justifiable criticism 
valenti said wednesday in new york its no ones fault but the 
x rating has a patina a complexion which frankly we never intended 
it to have by renaming it nc17 we hope we will convey to the 
movie world there are any number of reasons for a film to get this 
rating 
we hope this will clarify that we are not making judgments on 
xrated films valenti said i wanted to make sure if a change 
was made it was reasonable sane wise and beneficial to the 
parents 
coupled with the new rating the association also will provide 
theater owners and critics with more detail on films with an r 
rating and why exactly they received it sex violence language 
harvey weinstein the cochairman of miramax films was 
especially relieved by the decision several of miramaxs recent 
releases have been rated x they include the cook the thief his 
wife amp her lover and tie me up tie me down from 
oscarnominated director pedro almodovar 
i think this is a great step forward weinstein said 
miramax is delighted to have played a significant part in the 
battle against censorship in america this just goes to show that 
being tenacious without waving the flag can get the job done 
before the announcement valenti had been adamant in his defense 
of the previous system he said the ratings continued to provide 
useful guidelines to parents 
if you add another category youre asking the rating board to 
make judgments about artistic integrity valenti said in july he 
maintained wednesday that he had not compromised 
the last time the ratings were changed was in 1984 when the 
pg13 rating was added between the pg and r ratings that change 
was prompted by indiana jones and the temple of doom 
a number of films during recent years have been rated x but the 
frequency of the rating became newsworthy as critics and theater 
chains pressed for a new rating category 
other xrated films have included 1969s midnight cowboy 
1973s last tango in paris 1969s if and 1971s a 
clockwork orange

epa administrator william reilly called 
wednesday for a reexamination of the nations environmental 
priorities to focus more attention on the areas of greatest risk 
reilly in an address to the national press club said limited 
resources to deal with the vast number of environmental issues 
facing the country must not be wasted on lowpriority items 
he released a report by the agencys science advisory board 
which concluded that too many agency decisions are made because of 
publicily perceived health risks and not risks based on scientific 
research 
the report said among other things that epa should attach as 
much importance to reducing ecological risk as it does to reducing 
human health risk 
the advisers grouped problems into high medium and low risk 
areas 
oill spills groundwater pollution and radioactive isotopes pose 
relatively low risks they said 
pesticides acid rain and surface water pollution were examples 
of what they said were mediumrisk areas 
the highrisk group consisted of four problems global warming 
from the greenhouse effect depletion of the ozone layer loss 
of biological diversity and extinction of species and destruction 
of natural environments such as rain forests 
reilly and his predecessors have expressed chagrin that the 
agency at congressional direction spends billions of dollars 
every year on cleaning up toxic waste dumps which among other 
things pollute groundwater and much less on more serious 
environmental and health risks 
we must do a better job in setting environmental priorities 
said reilly he urged a broad robust national dialogue 
involving the epa congress industry and the public on what areas 
pose the greatest risks and where government resources should be 
directed 
are we spending all our money on the right things reilly 
asked too often in the area of environmental protection the 
government has not he suggested 
as we gear up to deal with the environmental problems of the 
1990s and beyond i think the time has come to start taking aim 
before we open fire he said

a federal grand jury investigating a failed 
credit union concluded wednesday that stories of sexual abuse and 
drug trafficking that arose after the credit union closed were 
unfounded 
the grand jury returned two indictments and said in its report 
that it found evidence of obstruction of justice in its 
investigation of the franklin community federal credit union 
shortly after franklin failed in november 1988 allegations were 
circulated about sexual abuse of children and drug abuse among 
prominent omaha residents 
the grand jury report said it didnt find any credible evidence 
that any prominent individuals in omaha were involved in any ring 
of organized activity to sexually exploit minors transport minors 
in interstate commerce for sexual purposes or to traffic in 
controlled substances 
hopefully this will place to rest the concerns and the rumors 
that have been circulating in our community this past year said

sexually abused as a minor and sandra rhode prucha of omaha

community federal credit union 
ms owen who was indicted ealier on perjury charges by a 
county grand jury was charged with eight counts of lying to the

awaiting trial in us district court on 40 counts charging 
conspiracy fraud and filing false tax returns in connection with 
the november 1988 failure of franklin

against the kings seeking to recover some of the 39 million it 
says was missing from the credit union 
the federal grand jury spent 24 months investigating the credit 
unions failure 
its report said it found evidence to believe there had been an 
obstruction of justice but not enough to charge anyone but ms 
owen the federal grand jury indicted ms owen for statements she 
made to the federal grand jury in june 
in july a douglas county grand jury indicted ms owen on eight 
counts of perjury for testimony she gave to the grand jury in the 
state court system 
the douglas county grand jury had said a story of sexual abuse 
and prostitution told to a legislative committee was a carefully 
crafted hoax 
the bank fraud charge against ms prucha 47 alleges that she 
used expense vouchers to obtain cash and credit then used the cash 
and credit for her personal use lahners said the indictment 
alleges that about 29000 was involved he said

a task force investigating the slayings of 43 
women in san diego county is targeting six current and former 
police officers two newspapers reported wednesday 
the metropolitan homicide task force is investigating officers 
who may have associated with slain prostitute donna gentile or her 
missing friend cynthia maine the los angeles times and the san 
diego union said 
gentile and maine both were prostitutes and police informants 
had served time in jail and were romantically involved with at 
least one member of the san diego police force the newspapers 
reported 
gentile was found slain in 1985 shortly after she testified 
against two police officers maine disappeared in early 1986 three 
months after gaining early release from jail by agreeing to provide 
information on several officers the newspapers reported 
the task force is trying to find out where maine is but 
they believe shes dead a source told the times they are 
thinking its more than a coincidence that these six officers had 
some involvement with one prostitute who is dead and one who is 
missing 
surveillance has been conducted on several officers and 
authorities eventually expect to talk to them to determine if they 
are linked to some of the killings of 43 women mostly prostitutes 
whose bodies have been found in remote parts of san diego county 
since 1985 the union said 
investigators have said they believe some but not all of the 
slayings may have been committed by the same person 
the only person arrested so far in any of the cases is alan 
michael stevens 48 a southern california drifter charged in the 
1988 death of cynthia mcvey his trial is set to begin monday 
task force spokeswoman bonnie dumanis confirmed the maine 
investigation but wouldnt elaborate 
we are talking to anyone who has known or been associated with 
cynthia maine but i wouldnt say were investigating anyone in 
particular dumanis said wednesday 
gentile was killed shortly after she testified before a city 
civil service commission about police misconduct she was found 
with rocks packed in her mouth suggesting to detectives that she 
was killed because of her testimony 
maine the daughter of a former san diego police officer was 
sent to jail in september 1985 for writing bad checks while there 
she agreed to provide information against several police officers 
in exchange for early release said maines sister lori helle 
she was released from jail in november 1985 and disappeared 
three months later 
maines mother lynda coleman said her daughter worked 
undercover for police at solar turbines inc in drug 
investigations

president bush asked congress on wednesday for 
a streamlined process to negotiate a freetrade agreement with 
mexico the nations thirdlargest trading partner 
the agreement would be aimed at removing tariffs quotas and 
other trade barriers between mexico and the united states a 
freetrade treaty already is in force between the united states and 
canada 
canada also has asked to participate in the us negotiations 
with mexico to achieve a trade treaty applying to all three 
countries bush said the administration would explore the 
possibility of a threenation accord and inform congress of his 
recommendations 
in a letter to the senate finance committee and house ways and 
means committee bush formally notified lawmakers of his intention 
to open trade talks with mexico 
he said that mexican president carlos salinas de gortari has 
undertaken dynamic marketoriented reforms 
we see substantial opportunities for mutual benefit in further 
lowering impediments to bilateral trade in goods and services and 
to investment the president said 
the notification gives congress 60 legislative days to decide 
whether or not to deny bushs request for socalled fasttrack 
negotiating authority because of the congressional calendar the 
60day period should run out sometime next spring 
if the fasttrack process is authorized the united states would 
begin negotiations under rules that would prevent the senate from 
being able to amend any treaty that results 
sen lloyd bentsen dtexas who chairs the finance committee 
signalled a certain reluctance to embrace the fasttrack 
noamendment process 
never before have we negotiated a freetrade agreement with a 
country so different from us economically he said 
bush said that if the united states decides to expand the talks 
with mexico into a threenation negotiating process it would not 
affect the validity of the trade agreement with canada 
last year the united states exported 2497 billion in goods to 
mexico and received 2719 in imports for a deficit of 22 
billion mexico has the worlds eighth largest oil reserves and a 
freetrade pact with the united states could spur oil production

carnegie hall opened its centennial season 
wednesday with the same piece of music that opened the very first 
concert in the hall on may 5 1891 
beethovens leonore overture no 3 was performed expertly 
and with restraint by the los angeles philharmonic conducted by 
its former music director andre previn the offstage horn was 
crisp and the flute soloist was excellent 
carnegie hall is celebrating its 100th anniversary for the next 
seven months ending with a may 5 concert by various soloists and 
the new york philharmonic that will fulfilling the wish of 
carnegies executive director judith arron that american orchestras 
open and close the season 
before wednesday nights program began a fanfare brought the 
audience into the hall and the los angeles philharmonic played a 
preconcert starspangled banner in arturo toscaninis 
orchestration 
after the leonore the orchestra played two pieces by 
americans written some half century after carnegie hall opened but 
not avantgarde 
itzhak perlman was soloist in barbers 1939 concerto for 
violin and orchestra hearing this piece melodic and attactive 
to the ear makes one wonder why it isnt programmed more often 
lush violins are saved from sounding like movie music by the good 
taste of the melodies perlmans tone went from silver shimmering 
like leaves in an aspen grove to warmly mellow 
the second movement had an elegant pastoral melody played by 
solo oboe in the pizzicato of the third perlman swung his 
shoulders in time to what he was playing some parts of the third 
movement had fast russian rhythms 
after intermission schumans symphony no 3 from 1941 was 
played when it finished william schuman who was 80 in august and 
has been composing for 50 years took a bow from a box 
coming right after the barber piece which seems to flow 
naturally the symphonys changes of mood seem to lack coherence 
but it gave the brass and percussion their chance during the 
evening to be loud and even for the violins to be robust 
it was a bigfinish halfhour fanfare to carnegie halls 
centennial season 
the audience many of whom had bought 1000 tickets and were 
continuing on to a dinner dance at the metropolitan club gave the 
opening night concert a standing ovation

the playground at vladimir ilyich 
lenin elementary school was quiet as classes began this year a few 
serbian boys kicked a scuffed soccer ball while ethnic albanians 
huddled around schedules posted on the wall 
the mood was ominous the kids didnt mix 
the school in pristinas highrise dardania suburb is split by 
the bitterest of yugoslavias many ethnic disputes the division 
between serb and albanian touches everything in pristina and the 
surrounding kosovo province and appears irreparable 
tensions are rising very fast and our serb colleagues and 
ourselves well we dont even say hi anymore said sefia 
hassani a young ethnic albanian who teaches english 
serbias communist leadership appears ready at all costs to hold 
onto the southern province that it administers and serbs revere as 
the sacred heartland of their medieval empire 
the albanians who make up 90 percent of kosovos 19 million 
people are demanding political autonomy 
in all of eastern europe stalinism is dead or dying here 
its having a renaissance said ibrahim rugova an albanian who 
heads the kosovo democratic union a political party recently 
legalized by yugoslavias federal government 
we are trying to find a peaceful solution but the serb 
government isnt ready to negotiate it just uses repression he 
charged 
relations between the two ethnic groups in yugoslavias poorest 
province have been deteriorating for more than a decade 
serbs brand albanians murderers and rapists they say more than 
220000 serbs have been chased off their land since 1966 
more than 60 ethnic albanians have died in kosovo in occasional 
clashes with police the last 18 months albanian leaders say more 
than 600000 have been investigated for politicial crimes since 
1981 
when kosovos parliament unilaterally declared the province 
sovereign on july 2 serbian authorities in belgrade promptly 
dissolved the assembly closed albanianlanguage media fired about 
15000 ethnic albanian workers and took control of police and local 
administration 
albanian leaders called a oneday general strike sept 3 the 
day before school started paralyzing shops and factories 
authorities threatened to fire strikers and locked managers and 
workers out of their stores when they returned 
belgrade television also announced a group of outlawed kosovo 
deputies from the dissolved parliament was detained sept 7 for 
meeting secretly and declaring the province yugoslavias seventh 
republic 
serbia cannot stand by and watch someone declare the secession 
of serbias territory to protect it we are prepared to use all 
legal means said momcilo trajkovic serbias deputy premier and 
kosovo governor 
he said dissolution of parliament and the takeover of pristinas 
media prevented open war in kosovo because no leadership in 
serbia could have convinced the serb nation not to fight for their 
territory 
but in nearly a month since then four more ethnic albanians 
have been killed in two incidents two in a shootout with serb 
police that raided the village of palatna north of pristina in 
search of arms and two others after allegedly firing at police at 
a roadblock 
this emotional conflict is rooted deep in history kosovo polje 
or the field of blackbirds was the site of a bloody battle in 1389 
that pitted the orthodox serb empire and its christian allies 
against ottoman turks 
nowadays serbs accuse moslem albanians of nationalism tinged 
with islamic fundamentalism separatism and plotting to merge 
kosovo with neighboring albania 
serbia is currently an irrational regime it is reacting like 
a wounded beast it knows its dying but it wont die without a 
fight said veton surroi a prominent albanian leader 
nationalism is running high in serbia yugoslavias largest 
republic with more than 9 million people radio television and 
politika the oncerespected belgrade daily now toe the hardline 
of serbian leader slobodan milosevic 
general elections in serbia are expected by early next year but 
western observers say milosevics communists now renamed the 
socialists likely will win and continue to avoid democratic reform 
if they can play on serbs nationalist fears 
croatia and slovenia yugoslavias most westernoriented 
republics where centerright governments have already replaced 
communists are worried that the kosovo crackdown will drag 
yugoslavia into international isolation as the west makes economic 
aid increasingly dependent on democracy and human rights 
unless they get rid of the kosovo problem yugoslavia cant 
hope for any major international aid coming in said one western 
diplomat in belgrade 
according to rugova only economic sanctions and diplomatic 
pressure from abroad can change serbian policy on kosovo 
that pressure is mounting a delegation of us congressmen 
headed by sen robert dole rkan visited pristina in august and 
said it was disturbed by fresh evidence that the serbian 
authorities are engaged in a systematic pattern of violating the 
human rights of albanians 
but the serbian government though strapped for capital as 
yugoslavia tackles the painful transition to freemarket economics 
is defiant in the face of growing western criticism 
even if we are subjected to economic sanctions we will not 
give up striving for our territorial integrity said trajkovic 
in addition to firing albanians from statecontrolled jobs serb 
authorities are also trying to resettle kosovo with serbs from 
other parts of yugoslavia 
they plan to introduce a serbian school curriculum in the 
province that will replace teaching of albanian history and 
literature with serbian classes

mormons who generally have kept aloof from other christian 
communities are gradually and in expanding ways moving into 
working association with them 
to some extent the past shunning has been mutual steps toward 
alleviating it represent a quiet mending of a rupture in americas 
socialreligious fabric 
for most of its 160 years the church of jesus christ of 
latterday saints mormon has avoided links with the other 
religious groups which in turn have kept a cold shoulder toward 
mormons 
but on both sides leaders are showing a growing impulse for 
contacts and efforts toward better understanding and are increasing 
moves for cooperation although some distrust lingers and some 
people oppose the trend alltogether 
some mormons dont want it said mormon theologian roger r 
keller of brigham young university in provo utah some of the 
others are suspicious of mormons but weve begun to break through 
the shell of isolation 
as misconceptions and scurrilous notions about each other are 
diminished more interchange becomes possible he said i 
hope we are standing at the crossroads of genuine dialogue 
such dialogue has flourished for years among protestant roman 
catholic anglican eastern orthodox and jewish groups reducing 
old prejudices and distortions about one another 
but mormons who were denounced persecuted and driven westward 
in their early years generally had stayed apart from that 
interreligious companionship and teamwork until recently 
dallin h oaks a member of the churchs ruling council of 12 
said the change is toward working together on matters of common 
interest and the church now is involved in several such projects 
i think the outlook for our being involved with others is 
good he said and i think other groups need us and we need 
other groups 
oaks a former law professor president of brigham young 
university and utah supreme court justice said that 
traditionally our church has been very distant from other 
churches 
considering the past persecutions of mormons he added it is 
is easy to understand why the latterday saints relationship with 
other faiths has been a strained and suspicious one 
but as the americanborn denomination has grown now totaling 4 
million us members and 7 million worldwide it has entered into 
several interfaith ventures in the last decade 
we are more mature as a church oaks said we feel less 
threatened by others were willing to forget some old persecutions 
and some old history and meet people on the basis of mutual respect 
and mature selfinterest 
among such recent moves by mormons was their joining in 1988 
with 22 faith groups protestant catholic and jewish in the 
national interfaith cable coalition producing religious and 
valuesoriented programs on the visn television network 
in 1986 mormons became part of the religious alliance against 
pornography a wide ecumenical crosssection in 1984 they 
affiliated with religion in american life involving most major 
us denominations in seeking to stimulate weekly worship 
also in the mid80s mormons entered into interreligious 
relief work including aid to the homeless they contributed about 
5 million to relief efforts in famineravaged central africa much 
of it through catholic relief services and the american red cross 
oaks as a former educator had experienced ecumenical 
cooperation in the association of presidents of independent 
colleges and universities in the 1970s and has since encouraged 
that trend in the church 
so far such connections have been on nondoctrinal matters and 
oaks emphasized that the church disapproves any discussions aimed 
at changing doctrines 
that however isnt the aim of interchurch doctrinal talks it 
is rather to explain their concepts to each other to overcome 
misperceptions of one another and to achieve fuller mutual 
understanding 
it is not only enriching but develops ones own christian 
understanding said keller a former presbyterian minister turned 
mormon with advanced degrees from princeton theological seminary 
and duke university 
there needs to be more forums for conversations he said 
while differing on some points and without seeking to change or 
convert one another benefits come in just getting to know and 
appreciate one another he said 
mormons hold some distinctive beliefs but like other 
christians they regard the bible as holy scripture honor christ 
as gods divine son uphold his teachings and believe in salvation 
through his atoning death and resurrection 
through candid dialogue participants learn from each other 
keller said out of the depth of spirituality i can learn so 
much from my protestant and catholic brothers and sisters we need 
to sit down in front of the fireplace with a hot cup of cider and 
talk he said 
i really believe god guides his children to truth as the 
spirit works in them and hearts are opened up the only way to 
know it happens is people of faith sharing with each other from the 
deepest recesses of their souls

ron kottemanns days are measured in 
hoofbeats and 12inch lengths of taffy his wages are quarters 
paid out mainly from small sweaty palms his shop is a fourfoot 
by sixfoot swaying box perched on high wooden wheels 
theres no better way to make a living in the world they can 
keep all their desk jobs said the roman candy man 
in the narrow wooden wagon drawn by rosie the mule kottemann 
makes and sells the handpulled italian taffy just as he 
grandfather did while rosie tows him through the streets of new 
orleans he boils up the sweet yellow globs adds vanilla 
strawberry or chocolate then kneads and pulls it into glistening 
sticky rope 
my grandfather started this in those days everybody had a 
wagon it wasnt a big deal youd see all sorts of wagons going 
around town with people selling stuff the world changed but we 
didnt said kottemann 41 
well some changes but only small ones the price has gone up 
roman candy sticks that sold for a nickel when sam cortese started 
making them in 1915 now go for a quarter 
kottemann has also added a second wagon that is permanently 
stationed at the audubon zoo and he sells to about 20 stores 
wholesale 
people tell me i should modernize kottemann said they 
say i should get rid of rosie and the wagon and get a truck but if 
i did that it would become a twoman operation id need someone to 
drive and someone to make the candy this way rosie drives and i 
make the candy she responds to voice commands so i hardly ever 
have to even touch the reins were the perfect team 
kottemann takes rosie from her stable behind his uptown new 
orleans home around 9 am and goes to work 
usually five days sometimes six once in a while seven if i 
need the money i try not to work on sundays and almost never on 
monday thats a real dead day for business he said 
he stops for business in various parts of town each morning 
downtown some days outside the parks on others occasionally in 
the french quarter 
i like to go into the quarter but only if there are a lot of 
local folks there the tourists think the wagon is cute and they 
take a lot of pictures but they dont know what roman candy is and 
they dont usually buy lots of smiling not many sales thats the 
tourist trade for me he said 
he changes locations in the afternoon every day during the 
school year he sets up outside a school before the closing bell 
things started changing about 10 years ago kottemann said 
i used to spend most of the days just driving through different 
neighborhoods it used to be that mama was home with the kids now 
mama and dad are both at work and the kids are in day care i can 
drive through a neighborhood now and not see a soul before 4 or 5 
oclock 
kottemann started working on the roman candy wagon with his 
grandfather when he was in the eighth grade by the time he went to 
college and then to the army he knew he wanted to carry on the 
business 
cortese died in 1969 as kottemann entered the service the 
candy wagon was off the street for three years the only shutdown 
in 75 years when kottemann was discharged the wagon began to make 
its rounds again 
he sells an average of 600 sticks of candy a day and with his 
zoo wagon and his store accounts kottemann said he makes a good 
living for his family it probably wouldnt support a big group 
but its plenty for us 
the future at this point kottemanns not sure 
crime is his biggest concern kottemann said hes not worried 
about his candy wagon being robbed hes afraid it will get so 
dangerous to live in town that he may have to move 
that would really hurt as it is now rosies stable is right 
in the back yard its been there for 100 years i just unhitch 
her feed her and go in the house if we move and shes stabled 
somewhere else that means id have to go there on my days off to 
take care of her it would mean commuting back and forth it would 
really change things he said 
its a faroff worry however for now and for the foreseeable 
future itll be business as usual at the roman candy wagon 
i make a good living and if i want to take off and go to my 
sons little league game or anything else i just do it how many 
executives do you know who can say that

a decade of noisy construction in 
downtown hartford has given way to eerie silence 
in one fiveday period hartford ranked near the bottom of a 
national survey of economic growth in urban areas a oncepopular 
restaurant across the street from city hall unexpectedly shut down 
permanently and in an emotional blow to the entire downtown 
sageallen amp co announced plans to close its 101yearold 
department store on main street 
i was devastated mayor carrie saxon perry said of the 
sageallen closing i said wow its the end of an era 
and there have been other setbacks two of hartfords largest 
downtown hotels shut down completely taking 40 percent of the 
citys hotel rooms with them and west hartfordbased colonial 
realty co which owns several of the citys biggest office towers 
was forced into involuntary bankruptcy proceedings 
at one point things got so bad that a group of merchants held a 
press conference downtown to announce that contrary to rumors 
they were staying open 
business owners and city officials can take some comfort in 
knowing that other large cities in connecticut and across new 
england are experiencing similar downturns in construction and 
retail activity 
but in hartford where civic groups have struggled for years to 
coax people into a central business district dominated by insurance 
giants like aetna life amp casualty and the travelers the economic 
slump has brought on a bout of civic soulsearching 
right now we have lost the soul of the city said brad 
davis a radio talk show host who has worked in the city for three 
decades 
the only thing thats going to save the city is to bring back 
its soul he said people have got to be shown that we have an 
identity were not boston and were not new york but weve got 
our own identity 
hartford a city of 130000 and the hub of a metropolitan area 
of 750000 people faces the same problems as many other us 
cities the flight of whites and the middle class to the suburbs 
the perception of high crime parking and transportation 
efforts to revive downtown have met with some success union 
place a glitzy corridor of nightclubs and restaurants near the 
citys renovated railroad station is packed with young people 
several nights a week 
a new retail row has sprouted on pratt street an intimate side 
street in the center of the city 
and several civic groups are dedicated to breathing new life 
into downtown when things get a little tougher you have to pull 
together said tana parseliti whose family has run franks 
restaurant in the heart of downtown for 46 years 
still on many nights downtown restaurants scramble for 
business after office workers desert the area few people live in 
the citys center the districts only hardware store closed 
recently and there hasnt been a movie theater downtown in years 
the corporations that dominate hartfords downtown exist almost 
as selfcontained communities complete with their own cafeterias 
health clubs and coffee shops and connected by skywalks 
a person can come in off the highway go into one of these 
corporations and never come out until they leave town said 
perry 
we need a mixed city we dont just need businesses and the 
poor and thats a national struggle for cities its not just a 
hartford struggle 
buoyed by the growth of its large corporations hartford the 
states capital boomed in the 1980s highrises sprouted and 
sprouted a developer announced plans to build the tallest building 
in new england a skyscraper stretching 888 feet 8 inches 
but when the regions economy slumped downtown office vacancy 
rates soared and the building stopped leaving the city pockmarked 
by vacant lots 
after a protracted struggle against conservationists developers 
destroyed the citys first skyscraper the 77yearold hartford 
aetna building this spring to make room for a 45story bank tower 
but construction of the new tower has been delayed and the site 
now is marked by a giant crater idle construction equipment and 
several boardedup storefronts 
at the other end of asylum street the glassandsteel parkview 
hilton that symbolized the new look of hartford in the 1950s has 
been shut down since new years eve unable to find a buyer the 
hotels owners scheduled an auction in early june but then decided 
to raze the building to make room for what they hope will be an 
office tower 
hanging over the citys economic uncertainty are fears that 
united technologies corp may take its corporate headquarters out 
of hartford the defense giant has announced plans to move its 
headqarters probably within the city but has not disclosed a 
final decision 
shortly after sageallen announced it would close its downtown 
store 70yearold minnie wright made a decision of her own the 
stores closing would change her shopping habits she said after 
shopping at the downtown store for five decades she now would take 
the bus to a west hartford mall to shop at the sageallen there 
all the stores are going out there she said whos coming 
in here 
she shook her head as she reminisced about downtown when it 
bustled with department stores cafeterias and fiveanddimes 
it looks like its on the way out she said completely

in the greatest assemblage of world leaders 
ever gathered the world summit for children meets on sunday 
shadowed by crisis that threatens the peace and peace dividend that 
seemed at hand when it was conceived 
the leaders of more than 70 governments are to sit at one 
gigantic united nations conference table there are places for 74 
to talk about the worlds children their needs and what can be 
done to meet them 
only the heads of governments can participate no standins or 
deputies at the table the summit census nearly doubles what was 
the record 38 world leaders who met at the united nations on its 
40th anniversary in 1985 
president bush will be in new york for the sunday summit and is 
to speak briefly since there are to be about 30 speeches they are 
limited to a maximum of 5 minutes each every orator has been 
forewarned 
these most powerful people in the world are getting together 
to deal with the problems of the most vulnerable people in the 
world said jay ross a spokesman for the united nations 
childrens fund that carries a message 
the statistic cited over and over in preparation for the summit 
every day about 40000 children under age 5 die of starvation or 
diseases that could be prevented 
it is the greatest condemnation of our times that more than a 
quarter of a million small children should still be dying every 
week of easily preventable illness and malnutrition said james 
p grant the unicef executive director in the 1989 annual report 
that gave rise to the summit plan 
indeed until aug 2 it seemed that the 45th general assembly 
of the united nations the first of the postcold war era could 
concentrate on that and other chronic world problems 
then iraq invaded kuwait igniting the first major crisis of the 
new era and the un became the crucial forum in the world 
response to baghdad voting to impose a trade embargo and 
authorizing the use of force if necessary to make it stick 
iraqi diplomats tried futilely to link the embargo with the 
summit on children asserting at one planning session that it would 
lead to starvation of their young and that the summit should say 
so it wont nor will iraq be participating on sunday saddam 
hussein had said he would send his governments health minister 
but aides were not invited to participate only to watch 
there were echoes of other more familiar complaints dating 
from cold war times as summit planners put together a world 
declaration on the survival protection and development of 
children 
the statement due for ceremonial signing by the summit 
participants on sunday lists war aggression and foreign 
occupation among the causes of the suffering of children a cuban 
diplomat proposed amending the statement to include colonialism as 
another cause a british aide said that it should list totalitarian 
dictatorships instead both amendments were scrapped 
with the ebbing of cold war the statement says significant 
resources could be released for purposes other than military 
ones and the needs of children should be a priority claim on 
those resources 
thats the peace dividend argument it runs headon into the 
deficits plaguing the united states and the economic crisis 
wrenching the soviet union 
the summit statement also promises a global attack on 
poverty seeking more aid trade debt relief and economic growth 
for the developing world at this point the industrial nations are 
struggling against an economic slump of their own worsened by the 
sharp increase in oil prices because of the persian gulf crisis 
it urges every nation to reexamine its current national 
budget and its foreign aid commitment to give priority to 
programs to cut child mortality and hunger and to make primary 
education available to at least 80 percent of the worlds children 
by the year 2000 
the summit declaration seeks those goals and more acknowledging 
that they are ambitious and will take extraordinary worldwide 
effort 
in that quest the fact that sundays meeting is being held may 
be more important than anything said there it puts the problems of 
children on a world stage at least for a day 
the challenge now will be to translate one day at the summit 
ino a drive that will last the decade

nearly 10 years ago cspan began its first 
callin show alas there was a power failure despite the fact 
that cspan is in washington dc where even reporters think they 
have power 
something went poof and the lights all blew the power blew 
cspan chairman brian lamb recalls repairs were made in five 
minutes but for a while it was bizarre guerilla television 
on oct 7 cspan will celebrate its 10th year of callins with 
the same four guests journalists on the communications beat 
discussing how todays issues in the communications industry 
compared to those of 1980 
back then a viewer from yankton sd was the first caller to 
cspan a nonprofit company originally created by the cable 
television industry to provide gaveltogavel coverage of house 
proceedings 
lamb doesnt recall the first callers name but thats 
understandable he estimates that about 100000 viewers have dialed 
in since then to grill guests or have their say on the hot issues 
of the day 
the callers he does remember range from an 11yearold 
mississippi schoolgirl to gary owens the freespirit announcer 
from the old laughin series to former president reagan who 
has called twice 
the audience and callers cspan currently serves nearly 51 
million homes in the us no longer are only americans that 
changed in 1988 
now its two 90minute weekday callin shows in the morning and 
early evening plus additional ones held after such events as a 
presidential speech are carried via satellite in 26 other 
countries mainly in europe 
viewers there also can phone in although only two lines are set 
up for their calls compared to eight for domestic dialers in all 
cases each dialer foots the cost of the toll call 
the topics discussed usually are national and international 
matters such as the federal budget social security highway 
safety legal issues and in recent weeks the persian gulf crisis 
and the savings and loan mess 
the majority of guests tend to be federal officials and house 
and senate members when he was vice president president bush was 
a guest his vice president dan quayle also has been on fielding 
questions 
it may be heresy but lamb says print journalists not the 
electronic kind are the shows secondlargest group of guests his 
reasoning 
television fills in a blank or two but if you go to the 
backbone of where people get their information its in the 
newspaper 
like their radio cousins television callin shows have become 
so rampant they give common a bad name but cspans are unique in 
two regards 
one is that they have no star hosts the shows never say in 
advance who the hosts will be there are 10 three of them 
journalists the rest including lamb are cspan staffers for whom 
hosting is a secondary job 
on any given day for example the host could be bruce collins 
cspans chief attorney or susan swain its senior vice president 
for programming lamb says 
we want people to tune in for the issues and the guests 
instead of the hosts he says 
as in 1980 all the calls are live there is no sevensecond 
delay a common device of callin shows now to let the host dump 
a dialer who might fancy himself the next andrew dice clay 
weve always tried to make this as real as possible so that 
the audience wont feel any kind of technical interference between 
them and the guests lamb says 
the show does periodically hear from those who are none too 
tightly wrapped he says but that is not the norm by any stretch 
of the imagination but he concedes if the moon is full and 
this is not an exaggeration you can have a very unusual 
program 
it is the nature of life that hosts of television talk shows 
often are guests on other television talk shows phil donahue does 
it all the time 
although lamb is a noname relatively speaking as a callin 
show host he too has been a guest twice on a national 
television callin show larry kings show on the cable news 
network 
each visit induced high anxiety he says its much easier 
being a host than a guest youre in control when youre the host 
when youre the guest youre totally at the mercy of the host 
so i have a great appreciation for how we can screw things 
up 
 
elsewhere in television 
cable food for thought robert wussler who once headed cbstv 
then was a top executive for cable maestro ted turner thinks there 
could be megabucks when and if hollywood decides to air hit movies 
on payperview cable while the films still are in theaters 
wussler president of comsat video enterprises told a cable 
industry lunch here this week that he thinks this may happen in 
1995 or 1996 one hot picture he predicted in one night will 
gross 100 million from a payperview showing

the pennsylvania turnpikes goal when it 
opened 50 years ago was to provide a fast way over and through the 
appalachian mountains what it gave america was a faster way to the 
future 
the 160mile fourlane ribbon of concrete became the precursor 
of the united states interstate highway system conquering 
2800foot hills with slopes wide lanes rest areas and exit ramps 
that became the standard for todays superhighways it opened oct 
1 1940 
when the federal government was developing the interstate 
system they had us as an example said neal wood chief bridge 
engineer on the highway and the pennsylvania turnpike commissions 
unofficial historian 
when we had a good design they used it when one was bad 
they changed it wood said 
the turnpike was and still is an engineering marvel the 
original section snaked its way from irwin near pittsburgh to 
middlesex near harrisburg through seven tunnels and across scores 
of bridges 
the roads groundwork both literally and figuratively had been 
laid a halfcentury earlier by the new york central railroad 
william vanderbilt started tunnel work and grading on a south 
penn route to compete with the pennsylvania railroad which ran 
through altoona 
both railroads were convinced to ease their competition for fear 
both would go out of business on one telegrams notice work was 
stopped everyone was paid off accounts were settled and the line 
was abandoned wood said 
in the 1930s state lawmakers and lobbyists joked about erecting 
a truckers highway on old bridge pilings across the susquehanna 
river that joke has since been recognized by the american 
society of civil engineers as a national civil engineering 
landmark 
highway systems to that time werent systems at all but roads 
that meandered from town square to town square when the original 
section of the pennsylvania turnpike was opened it bypassed 939 
cross streets 12 railroad crossings and 25 traffic signals along 
us 11 and us 30 the old lincoln highway 
this became more than a way of getting across pennsylvania it 
was a tourist attraction wood said 
the us bureau of public roads had predicted only 715 cars 
would travel the turnpike each day in 1940 other government 
studies predicted toll roads would never work 
but in the highways first four days 6000 cars traveled the 
turnpike each day on oct 6 1940 the turnpike got its first dose 
of sunday drivers when 27000 clogged the artery 
attendants at three of the interchanges ran out of 
passengercar tickets and resorted to handing out lighttruck 
tickets or handwritten notes according to a history of the 
turnpike 
many communities had shunned turnpike workers during 
construction fearing towns would die once the highway opened but 
many prospered 
when they build a bypass around a community the economic 
impact is not that great said robert barnoff visiting professor 
of civil engineering at bucknell university what they lose in 
gasoline or hamburger sales they usually get back by attracting 
industry with their better transportation system 
even before the original section opened the turnpike planned 
expansion to philadelphia and the ohio state line three more 
extensions opened by 1957 currently the turnpike commission is 
building two more offshoots to the greater pittsburgh 
international airport and around greensburg another new section is 
planned from pittsburgh south to morgantown wva 
with no recent tollroad precedents early turnpike employees 
had to improvise lee rishel was asked to train the toll 
collectors but didnt know how much they were supposed to collect 
what they did at toll bridges and tunnels was collect at the 
point of entry and let people cross there were no toll roads like 
this with eight intermediate exits so we had to come up with a 
fare schedule said rishel 78 
rishels committee determined that automobile drivers should pay 
a penny per mile and that truckers should pay a little more 
how much more was difficult to determine 
at first we had a mess with the classification he said 
we classified by vehicle size but it was a cause of complaint 
among truckers because a truck hauling feathers was paying the same 
as a truck hauling steel in 1955 the turnpike began assessing 
trucks by weight 
in 1956 with the start of the interstate system the turnpikes 
image began to change the highway went from being an industry 
standard for excellence to a standard of how highways shouldnt be 
built 
there are four lanes of traffic two in both directions and a 
narrow divider barnoff said they had a lot of headon 
collisions and at the speeds they were traveling you had some big 
ones lots of fatalities 
the first speed limit 70 mph wasnt posted until the highway 
was open 6 months concrete barriers along the medial strip were 
completed in 1969 
the fatality rate on the highway now is among the lowest in the 
nation among turnpikes 08 per 100 million miles driven the rate 
for all rural interstates is 16 per 100 million miles according 
to turnpike figures 
but cars still shine headlights across the lanes at a distance 
of 10 feet and there isnt much room for improvement 
the growth thats occurred across the roadway fence makes it 
difficult to convert our highway to what people are accustomed 
to martin said our success has been our limitation weve 
pinned ourselves in by development

tellers are gathering clerks are stocking 
deposit and withdrawal slips and security people are lengthening 
the line dividers as banks brace themselves for another lost 
friday 
more than 80 million workers who are paid weekly biweekly and 
bimonthly will get their checks on the same day sept 28 and 
most will make a stampede for the bank 
its a massive problem brace pattou a spokesman for harris 
bank in chicago said of the event which will occur just four 
times this year 
to cope with the convergence of customers harris takes former 
tellers who do other jobs in the bank and puts them behind the 
counter the bank also issues white carnations to lobby managers to 
make them visible and accessible when people have problems or 
more likely become impatient over the long lines pattou said 
other banks forbid tellers from taking lunch breaks during peak 
noontime hours as transactions at the windows and automatic teller 
machines jump as much as 50 percent 
one way to avoid the mayhem is for employees to have their 
companies deposit their paychecks directly into their bank 
accounts 
the practice is embraced by nearly all japanese businesses and 
most europeans but in the united states only 17 million checks are 
deposited directly according to figures from the national 
automated clearing house association a herndon vabased trade 
group 
direct deposit is safe and efficient and relieves busy workers 
of a trip to the bank simply to dump money into an account why 
take the risk or lose time dealing with a paycheck said elliott 
mcentee clearing house association president and chief executive 
but corporations and banks stand to reap big benefits 
themselves the clearing house association estimates employers 
could save anywhere from 10 cents to 23 cents on every paycheck 
that is deposited directly 
furthermore the association estimates that conservatively 
companies would increase productivity by up to 5 billion a year 
because employees would no longer need to take time out to visit 
their financial institutions a recent study by the automated 
clearing house trade group found the average employee spends eight 
to 24 hours each year going to the bank during working hours 
for banks which have long been criticized for trying to keep 
average customers at arms length direct deposit would mean fewer 
inperson visits to the teller window or 60 cents saved per 
deposit transaction that could translate to tens of millions of 
dollars in weekly savings for the financial institutions according 
to the association 
then there is the issue of float the time between the deposit 
of a check in the bank and payment businesses which earn interest 
until checks are cashed will lose some of their float advantage 
with direct deposit but mcentee stresses that advantage will be 
more than made up in productivity savings 
the association has spent over 2 million in the past two years 
on a marketing campaign designed to encourage direct deposit among 
bank customers mcentee plans to make a personal pitch to american 
airlines executives this week 
so far the campaign has been met with reasonable success 
mcentee figures that 100000 companies are offering direct deposit 
to some or all employees double the number three years ago 
still many people are reluctant to rely on an allelectronic 
pay system it is clear from market research that some consumers 
want a paper check mcentee said 
it provides a sensation of security people think the paper 
check is good but electronic payment is more secure he said

michael owen perrys medicine could restore his 
sanity but it has one enormous side effect it could speed his 
death 
perry is a prisoner on death row and his fate will be argued 
tuesday before the us supreme court the state of louisiana wants 
to force him to take psychiatric medication if he is legally sane 
he can be executed 
perrys lawyers argue that forcible medicating would be a cruel 
and unusual punishment that ignores perrys rights to avoid 
unwanted medication 
the american medical association and the american psychiatric 
association say treating perry to aid in his execution would turn 
the healing art on its head perrys sentence should be commuted to 
life in prison they suggest 
were saying the cost here which is really a fundamental 
realignment of the role of medicine is a very high cost and the 
states interest in the difference between capital punishment and 
life imprisonment without parole doesnt justify that cost said 
attorney joel klein 
the state says giving him the drug is simply a necessary step 
for carrying out a death sentence a justifiable limitation on a 
condemned mans liberties much like strapping him into the electric 
chair besides the state is required to provide medical care and 
the medicine is good for him louisiana says 
perry 35 suffers from schizoaffective disorder causing him 
delusions hallucinations and disordered thinking 
he was sentenced in 1985 for shooting his parents and three 
other family members to death louisianas supreme court affirmed 
the conviction and the sentence but suggested a review of perrys 
mental competence to be executed 
there is a tradition in angloamerican law that people should 
not be executed while insane this doctrine which dates back to 
medieval times was adopted by the us supreme court in a 1986 
decision 
insanity is a legal term not a medical one in this case it 
refers to mental illness so severe that the prisoner is not aware 
of the impending punishment and why he is to suffer it 
the louisiana court ruled perry was sane but only while on 
medication it also ordered that perry be medicated even over his 
objection 
after the state supreme court refused to hear a challenge to 
that decision perrys lawyers appealed to the federal high court 
lawyers for both sides declined to be interviewed on the record 
but their supreme court briefs lay out their arguments in detail 
lawyers for louisiana say the death sentence wiped out any legal 
power perry would have to refuse the medication 
forced medication would not be a cruel and unusual 
punishment because perry would benefit medically from it the state 
says common sense dictates that the state does not violate the 
eighth amendment by doing something good for a prisoner 
in fact louisiana is required to medicate perry because the 
supreme court has declared that deliberately ignoring a prisoners 
serious medical need itself constitues cruel and unusual 
punishment the brief says 
perrys attorneys say the forced medication would be 
unconstitutional punishment rather than treatment the court order 
gives no consideration to perrys medical needs nor physician 
judgment they say 
the order also ignores the very real prospect of serious 
side effects raising the prospect of taking a drooling 
incontinent and tremulus man to the execution chamber they 
wrote 
in any case perrys lawyers say perrys response to medication 
is sporadic and unpredictable making it impossible to say whether 
he would be competent on the day of his execution 
with this instability and unpredictability how is michaels 
execution to be carried out the lawyers asked can the state 
wait until a good day and execute michael can michael be 
executed if his good days outnumber his bad days by some 
amount what amount and what happens if the date set in the death 
warrant is a bad day 
the ama and psychiatric association meanwhile say the death 
sentence does not outweigh perrys interest in avoiding unwanted 
medication an interest especially great when the injection sets 
the prisoner directly on the road to execution 
involuntary medication was not part of perrys sentence nor is 
it generally authorized by confinement the associations argue 
prior court decision support the idea that involuntary medical 
treatment is not permitted if it runs against a persons medical 
interests and is not necessary to treat a condition that may harm 
other people they say 
as for the argument that the medication would help perry any 
benefit would be both fleeting and purchased at the cost of his 
life the associations said in a brief 
outside observers are split on their reaction to the case 
dr gary glass an associate psychiatry professor at temple 
university and lecturer in law at villanova university said he 
personally hopes that the court would not allow execution of a 
person who is incompetent when not treated 
but his utilitarian practical answer is that nobody should 
be allowed to make a competent decision to avoid execution by 
becoming legally incompetent he said 
if a death sentence is imposed tuesday

mabel yee was just another frustrated 
commuter stuck in the middle of her stopandgo crawl to wrk when 
an idea hit her like an antsy driver following too close 
i thought gosh there must be some option to just sitting 
here this is stupid there must be something to do she 
said 
eighteen months later yee has found lots for commuters to do 
her company commuter products corp sells dozens of products to 
keep drivers busy safe relaxed fed or just plain entertained 
driven mad by traffic yee offers relief with a massaging car 
seat stressreduction tapes stereo headrests and an electronic 
message board that tells tailgaters to back off 
no time for breakfast keep a croissant fresh in a compact 
refrigerator and pop it into an envelopestyle foillined oven 
that plugs into the cigarette lighter the road hog apron and lap 
tray will keep the gray suit and red tie clean 
every minute counts there are portable fax machines travel 
desks and note boards that clip onto the steering wheel 
comuter products also offers gadgets for before or after a 
commute among them an underthepillow alarm that literally 
shakes up a sleeper without disturbing anyone else a multipocket 
folder to organize glove box rubble and a car finder that turns on 
the lights and honks the horn of your car from 200 feet way 
prices range from 495 for a tiny clipboard that attaches to a 
window with suction cups to 1595 for the portafax 
yee declined to reveal sales figures or say if her company was 
making money but she said response so far has been enthusiastic 
i didnt have any of this i had to go looking for a piece of 
paper jot it down and still had to drive said yee 38 who 
quit her job in marketing and sales for xerox corp to start her 
company 
yee said commuters are a huge group of consumers that have been 
virtually ignored 
there are business markets sports markets but no one seems 
to think of commuters she said 
the average californian for instance now spends 45 minutes 
commuting each way to work and the average speed is 35 miles 
per hour expected to coast down to 17 miles per hour by the end 
of the century according to yee 
auto manufacturers just look at the car how fast does it go 
what about the tires how to make it pretty she said we look 
at the person inside the car saying get me out of here 
yee sells to that trapped soul through her love to commute 
catalogue drawing customers worldwide 
we actually had a guy call us on a cellular from new jersey 
and place an order from his car she said

one of the best things about pbs thoughtful new 
series the race to save the planet is that it doesnt try to 
sugarcoat the bad news and just describing the global environment 
means plenty of bad news 
the 10hour series is running weekly starting last thursday it 
also is running marathon style two hours a night for five nights 
beginning sunday 
the race to save the planet shows the state of the worlds 
environment and the interconnectedness of its problems that 
threaten it the series is an antidote to despair its sad and 
scary but its neither shrill nor naive 
we thought it was time for a series to attempt to show that 
there is a way forward said executive producer john angier a 
cofounding producer of pbs distinguished science series 
nova in 1975 
really the television audience and the magazinereading 
public have probably had quite enough of doom and gloom and there 
were other stories to tell he said the structure of the 
series is such that it kind of goes from the bad news to the good 
news 
what a lot of bad news there is humanity the series notes has 
been adversly affecting its environment since the neolithic 
revolution when we changed as a species from huntergatherers to 
farmerherders 
our first experiments with agriculture were dismal flops 
exhausting the land with overcultivation overgrazing and 
deforestation the neolithic revolutions basic lesson was that 
desert can always return and may yet 
a few thousand years later efficient agriculture created the 
next great human leap forward the industrial revolutions basic 
lesson surplus food from fewer farmers means more people can go to 
work in factory towns 
that revolutions crowning achievment once you got past the 
smog was to fling our species into space and once we got out 
there we looked back at our cradle and saw a big blue jewel 
spinning in space alone and unique 
that powerful image of the planet along with smog dead lakes 
and tainted springs helped create the environmental revolution 
the first earth day was in 1970 the first global conference on the 
environment in 1972 
that revolutions basic lesson youre running out of time and 
space you can breed yourself to starvation you can asphyxiate or 
poison yourself you can drown in your own dung heap its later 
than you think 
in a way human history with respect to the environment is a 
series of experiments and on many occasions the experiments have 
not worked angier said the big difference between now and 
10000 years ago is the scale 
now the scale is global it comes down to a question of room 
once there was room to make mistakes now weve come to the end of 
the planet 
our destruction of the rain forest which ecologists call the 
lungs of the planet is just such an experiment 
it was chillingly reported on pbs excellent frontline 
series by adrian cowell the decade of destruction and bill 
kurtis the rain forest imperative on cables aampe repeating in 
december 
we lose about 1 acres of rain forest each second we still 
dont know how many species of plants and insects exist and yet 
were discarding entire species each day we literally do not know 
what were losing 
we human beings are part of this terrifically complicated 
biological scheme that were only just beginning to glimpse the 
workings of angier said 
what we dont know is the extent to which you can chip away at 
that biological scheme before it collapses and cant support us 
human life he said all the biologists can tell you is that 
this is a really dangerous game and we dont know what were 
dealing with 
the race to save the planet moves from from the 
macroclimates global warming and thinning of the ozone to the 
microclimate analyzing the sources of air pollution in los angeles 
and water pollution in europes rhine river 
each of the environmental issues the series tackles becomes a 
story with a human face economic development in the third world 
creates environmental disasters preserving its wildlife takes 
second place to human hunger 
the remnants of eden segment shows a bloodymuzzled leopard 
in a kenyan game park gazing at gridlocked busloads of tourists 
angier says he gets irritated by tv wildlife shows with 
beautiful animals at work and prey what the camera didnt show 
you he said is its almost always in a nation thats 
struggling with great poverty and hunger 
the western worlds economic development decimated its wildlife 
and deforested europe the same thing is happening in the third 
world he said and the pace is accelerating 
the series is honest it came up against the economic realities 
of alternatives to fossil fuels and concluded that biomass 
cogeneration 100mpg cars and other alternatives become practical 
only when oil is too expensive 
that frank assessment was balanced however by a visit to the 
remarkable energyconserving residents of osage iowa theyre 
ordinary people who have learned how economical and comfortable it 
is to use energy efficiently 
the series also looks at the green revolution how it almost 
went bellyup in indonesia thanks to a new highyield rice that 
was plagued by insect infestation 
and with world population expected to double in 60 years the 
series looks at how different governments are dealing with 
burgeoning populations 
population is kind of the silent guest at the table for every 
one of these issues said linda harrar a nova producer who 
conceived the series when it became obvious there was too much 
material for the science show 
the race to save the planet was filmed in 30 nations on all 
seven continents it reiterates the hard choices we face as a 
species and that environmental solutions ultimately derive from 
individual behavior 
it demands leadership from our politicians and shows us local 
heroes whose work may help bring about global change thats the 
secret of the race to save the planet its not so much about 
nature as it is about people 
the planet itself is going to do just fine without us 
angier said its the people that are the problem and their 
place on the planet 
natures going to go on no matter what we do in some form or 
other 
it just wont be that big blue jewel spinning alone in space 
and we wont be there to wave goodbye

complicates reactions as f15s take off overhead on a sheet of 
flame and a roar 
we get on a saudi bus for the ride to cement city a marshalling 
area for new troops we wonder about a separate enclosed section at

the side of highway at dawn to fix a flat other traffic pulls to 
the side and the drivers get out to kneel and pray 
this is for real says bobby youmanns

if they can take it being over there i guess well have to take it

the governments factual presentations are grossly distorted 
its discussion of legal principles and applicable law virtually 
nonexistent indeed in its zeal to enhance mr milkens 
punishment the governments sentencing memorandum is inconsistent 
with portions of its own plea agreement and with the 
representations the government made to the court at the time of mr 
milkens plea 
first the governments memorandum confirms that there is 
no evidence linking mr milken in any way to a significant number 
of the alleged acts which the government asks this court to 
consider 
second the government has provided a highly selective 
version of its own evidence on a host of other transactions which 
it urges this court to consider 
the governments sentencing memorandum also seeks to 
punish mr milken for acts which do not constitute crimes it 
even blames mr milken for the fact that in december 1989 one 
year after the government banished mr milken from drexel and 
barred any drexel employee from even talking to him about anything 
directly or indirectly relating to business drexel which was 
then led by john shad the former chairman of the sec paid large 
bonuses to its employees 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
to accept the governments position would subject mr milken to 
punishment on charges that the government had agreed previously to 
dismiss with prejudice and would impose on this court the 
obligation to issue extensive findings of fact and conlusions of 
law on all matters that would have arisen had mr milken actually 
proceeded to trial to attempt to resolve these matters without 
full evidentiary hearings would violate due process but to hold 
such hearings which could last as long as a trial would be 
contrary to sound principles of judicial administration and would 
be inconsistent with the essence of the plea agreement 
the sentencing stage is not the time to conduct new trials 
on new offenses 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
unlike its typical sentencingmemorandum the government here 
does not analyze the relevant sentencing precedents in this 
district the reason is obvious the governments recommendation 
that mr milken receive a substantial period of incarceration 
cannot be reconciled with these precedents 
only three of the nearly 100 securities law violators 
sentenced in this district who pleaded guilty received prison 
sentences greater than one year and one day 
by every relevant indicator mr milken has fully and 
unconditionally accepted complete responsibility for the crimes he 
committed 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
we would have expected the government to acknowledge that he was 
no ivan boesky martin siegel dennis levine or even robert 
freeman 
no matter how unjust it must brand mr milken an insider 
trader to justify its own investigation yet its four isolated 
allegations of insider trading are easily refuted by documents and 
testimony currently in the possession of the government 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
the government charges that drexel provided unlawful gratuities 
to money managers and other institutional fiduciaries principally 
in the form of lucrative investment opportunities michael 
milkens business was not based on improper inducements to anyone 
the governments theory of wrongdoing presumes a world in 
which no one ever recommends a security to a client or tries to 
make money for a client if the client works for an institutional 
customer 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
in a balanced sentencing memorandum given the public clamor 
over the savings and loan crisis we would have expected the 
government to disclose forthrightly that it does not contend that 
mr milken was responsible for the financial collapse of any 
savings and loan obviously although the government does not 
publicly exonerate mr milken in its 215page memorandum it makes 
no claim and presents no evidence linking mr milken to todays 
savings and loan crisis 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
to understand the true nature of the transactions between boesky 
and mr milken it is necessary to understand the complex 
relationship between a securities salesman and his or her customer 
scorekeeping by brokers of profits lossses and favors for 
accounts is common in the industry so are efforts to make up 
losses 
the governments principal evidence in support of its 
position are the handwritten ledgers it has attached to its 
sentencing memorandum and boeskys payment of a 53 million fee 
to drexel but a careful review of the ledgers and of their 
origins reveals that far from being the memorialization of a 
boeskymilken illegal arrangement the ledgers were nothing more 
than an artifice used by both sides to gain an advantage through 
scorekeeping 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
the governments allegation that michael milken obstructed 
justice is as unfounded as its other allegations to begin with 
much of what the government characterizes as obstruction is not 
obstruction at all during the immediate aftermath of the service 
of grand jury and sec subpoenas at drexel there was unquestionably 
confusion fear and paranoia but confusion fear and paranoia are 
hardly illegal and were surely justifiable under the circumstances 
under these circumstances behavior that might otherwise 
seem silly or even paranoid furtive conversations or warnings 
about who might be an informant are perfectly understandable and 
they are not illegal 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
beyond urging this court to sentence mr milken for additional 
crimes in the absence of factual or legal support the government 
asks the court to punish mr milken for the demise of drexel and 
for his wealth and his status in the community these charges have 
no place at sentencing and do not befit the government 
as a result of drexels collapse in bankruptcy court 
mr milken has personally lost more than any other individual 
investor 
the governments sentencing memorandum includes no fewer 
than 25 references to mr milkens wealth and power in the 
first 25 pages alone just as such appeals to passion or 
prejudice are forbidden at trial they are equally offensive at 
sentencing

senate passage of a stock market reform bill 
that expands the securities and exchange commissions powers was 
reached after congressional staffers hammered out a compromise on 
program trading 
the compromise bill passed on a voice vote tuesday will allow 
the sec to regulate the controversial computerdriven trading 
strategy during times of extreme market turbulence known as 
volatility 
volatility frightens away the investors american firms need to 
compete and grow said sen donald riegle jr chairman of the 
senate banking committee which oversees the sec the reforms the 
senate enacted today take aim at excess volatility letting the sec 
stop such practices before they do their damage he added 
the legislation is expected to move to the full house within a 
few days if passed by the house the bill would then go to 
president bush for his signature 
this legislation strengthens the secs oversight of our 
securities markets and the participants in those markets said 
sen christopher dodd dconn one of the bills original 
sponsors 
the bill was worked out between the staffs of the senate banking 
committee and the house energy and commerce committee over the last 
month 
the talks were very cordial said a house committee aide 
in addition to the program trading curb the compromise market 
reform bill contains provisions passed separately by both the house 
and senate 
one expands the authority of the sec chairman to shut down the 
securities markets with presidential permission in times of 
market emergency previously only the president could order a 
trading halt 
other provisions 
require large securities traders to report their market 
positions to the sec 
mandate coordinated clearance and settlement of stocks 
options and futures contracts between the sec and the commodity 
futures trading commission 
require the treasury department federal reserve board the 
cftc and sec to report annually to congress on their efforts to 
protect the integrity of the markets 
give the sec authority to assess the financial health of the 
parent holding companies of brokerdealers 
the collapse of drexel burnham lambert inc the onetime junk 
bond giant of wall street was precipitated in february by the 
failure of its parent holding company which sec officials have 
complained they had no authority to monitor 
sec chairman richard c breeden said he was very pleased with 
the senate passage of the market reform bill and looked forward 
to the continuing congressional process 
the original house version the securities markets reform act 
passed in june contained a provision giving the sec authority to 
limit program trading during periods of extraordinary market 
volatility the sharp climbs or drops in stock prices 
the original senate version the market reform act passed last 
month did not have a program trading provision 
critics of program trading the rapidfire transactions through 
computerized buy and sell programs of enormous blocks of stocks 
blame it for worsening the 1987 stock market crash and the 
190point market drop last oct 13 
they are especially critical of one form of program trading 
index arbitrage in which speculators try to take advantage of 
small brief price differences between the stock and futures 
markets by simultaneously buying large orders in one market while 
selling in the other 
critics say that strategy andthe volatility that often seems to 
accompany it have driven small investors out of the stock market 
but industry groups including the new york stock exchange and 
the securities industry association have said their studies have 
not shown program trading to be the cause of the 1987 crash and 
suggested other ways to control market volatility

us car and truck makers turned in surprisingly 
strong midseptember sales figures down 56 percent from last 
year leading to speculation among analysts that the mideast crisis 
has yet to affect showroom traffic 
the 10 major us automakers reported tuesday their car and 
truck sales for the sept 1120 period fell to an average daily 
rate of 35810 vehicles compared with a rate of 37948 during the 
same time last year 
a 423 percent increase in the sales of cars by japanese 
companies was offset by a 75 percent decline in cars made by 
general motors corp ford motor co and chrysler corp the big 
three held 857 percent of the car market in midseptember 
on the whole it was a pretty good number said auto analyst 
david healy of barclays de zoete wedd investment bankers in new 
york i didnt expect them to come anywhere close to last year 
car sales were down 26 percent and truck sales were off 105 
percent 
the decline in truck sales led healy to wonder if the effects of 
rising gasoline prices stemming from the iraqs invasion of kuwait 
may begin showing up in dealerships soon 
if cars are down 2 percent and trucks are down 10 percent 
maybe there is a little shying away from gasguzzling trucks he 
said 
analysts speculated the sales rate may have received a jolt from 
wheeling and dealing that goes on in showrooms this time of year as 
dealers switch over from 1990 models to 1991 versions 
last year at this time automakers offered big incentives to 
shrink bloated newvehicle inventories this year inventories are 
lower lessening the need for incentives 
an amazing performance economist tom webb of the national 
automobile dealers association in mclean va said of the 
midseptember sales rate even skittish consumers are finding the 
model year closeout bargains too good to pass up 
chryslers truck sales fell 185 percent partly because of a 
lack of incentives on the vehicles and patience by consumers 
waiting to see the redesigned 1991 models company officials and 
analysts said 
a lot of people probably know that there is a new minivan 
coming so theyre not flooding the showrooms said auto analyst 
mary anne sudol of fitch investors service inc 
so far this year car and truck sales by the 10 companies were 
down 46 percent with car sales off 54 percent and truck sales 
down 31 percent 
ford said a 79 percent decline in its truck sales and a 73 
percent drop in its car sales during midseptember combined for a 
76 percent decline in vehicle sales for the year fords cars and 
trucks were selling at a pace 9 percent slower than last year 
gm said its truck sales declined 163 percent from last year and 
car sales dropped 64 percent combining for a 10 percent fall in 
vehicle sales the automakers sales so far this year were running 
48 percent behind last year 
chrysler which has been struggling with weakening sales nearly 
all year said its midseptember car sales were down 185 percent 
from last year and truck sales were off 121 percent combining for 
a 151 percent decline in vehicle sales through sept 20 of this 
year chryslers car and trucks sales declined 15 percent compared 
with last year

matsushita electric industrial 
cos proposed 7 billion acquisition of entertainment conglomerate 
mca inc would yield a fullyintegrated company combining two top 
players in entertainment hardware and software 
the new multinational enterprise if formed would marry the 
maker of technics panasonic and quasar audio and video equipment 
with mcas broad strength in movie record and television 
production 
by purchasing mca matsushita would control not only premium 
film producer universal studios but also a valuable film library 
mca records universal television powerful mcauniversal home 
video mcas growing theme park franchise a cable television unit 
a publishing group a concert and sports merchandising arm movie 
theaters and a 49 percent share in movie theater chain cineplex 
odeon 
the longterm advantages are that when you make hardware you 
can benefit from the software producers success said jeffrey 
logsdon an entertainment analyst at seidler amdec securities 
theres an insatiable consumer demand for entertainment 
software 
matsushita says mca is one of the companies with which 
matsushita is involved in talks and mca in a statement confirmed 
it is in discussions with a major international company regarding 
a possible negotiated acquisition of mca 
two mca board members said in interviews that they could neither 
confirm nor deny that a deal with matsushita was being discussed 
mca president sidney sheinberg did not return telephone messages 
in tuesdays edition the wall street journal said matsushita 
was offering between 70 and 80 a share for mca stock or a range 
of about 67 billion to 75 billion for the conglomerate 
stock in mca inc which struck a 52week low of 3412 in 
trading monday surged 1925 tuesday or more than 57 percent to 
5375 other entertainment stocks also advanced in trading with 
paramount communications up 312 to 3475 a share 
the journal said matsushita wants to keep mca management in 
place 
more than a quarter of matsushitas revenues are generated by 
sales of video equipment audio and electronic components combine 
for another 22 percent of revenues 
the surprise is not that matsushita finally decided to make such 
a move other foreign investors have been moving through hollywood 
as though it were a swap meet but that it is considering a 
company as massive as mca 
matsushita had sales of about 444 billion last year and is 
the worlds 25th largest publicly held company in the world 
according to a morgan stanley survey in june 
in 1989 mcas revenues were 34 billion with an income of 191 
million while it looks small in comparison mca is in fact a 
sprawling strapping enterprise 
the matsushita purchase exceeds sonys acquisition of columbia 
pictures entertainment for 5 billion last year columbia was and 
still is a struggling studio with limited assets and has yet to 
become a significant motion picture force since the buyout mca on 
the other hand is a vital concern 
foreign purchase of us entertainment enterprises makes sound 
financial sense entertainment is the united states second leading 
export accounting for a net positive trade balance of 
approximately 5 billion 
the continuing deregulation of the european television and the 
boom in overseas vcr sales almost 60 percent of japanese homes 
have vcrs have created a nearly insatiable need for us 
programming 
if completed the mca buyout would surely renew criticism of 
japanese control of american assets that surfaced last year in the 
deals for new yorks rockefeller center and columbia pictures 
entertainment 
the japanese had been keeping a low profile in such transactions 
until a tokyo golf tycoon purchased the pebble beach golf resorts 
in california for about 950 million 
the merger also might face regulatory barriers mca owns 
independent television station wwor in secaucus nj which a 
foreign company would be prevented from owning 
michael ovitz the head of the talent agency creative artists 
agency inc has represented matsushita in its attempts to find a 
software counterpart a caa spokesman said tuesday it was premature 
to speculate if ovitz would have any role in the new enterprise 
although mcas universal pictures is not hollywoods top film 
studio that honor is shared currently by disney and paramount 
many of its recent releases have been huge boxoffice hits 
in 1982 universal released the highestgrossing movie ever 
et the extraterrestrial and the film went on to set records 
at the nations video stores in 1988 the company has also reaped 
large profits from 1973s the sting 1975s jaws 1985s 
back to the future and 1988s twins 
current and upcoming universal releases include white 
palace the xrated henry amp june darkman childs play 
ii and kindergarten cop 
mca records carries the popular teen vocalist tiffany as well 
as the sultry star sheena easton and young soul singer bobby brown 
universal television produces the shows murder she wrote 
quantum leap several columbo movies the comedies 
coach major dad and uncle buck and the dramas over 
my dead body and law amp order 
universal studios hollywood was the nations third mostpopular 
theme park in 1989 drawing 51 million visitors 
mca has an agreement with nippon steel to explore japanese 
themepark ventures and a coventure with britains rank 
organisation to develop theme park ideas for france or england 
rank bought half of universal studios florida in early 1989 in a 
deal valued at 150 million the theme park is partially owned by 
cineplex odeon corp of toronto of which mca owns 49 percent

the proposed takeover of mca marks the latest 
chapter in one of hollywoods great success stories the rise of 
mca from jazz band booker to colossus of the entertainment 
industry 
on tuesday matsushita and mca inc said they were in talks for 
a possible merger valued at about 7 billion 
mcas transformation was stagemanaged over the companys 
65year history by a chicago eye doctor the late jules stein and 
a onetime movie usher from cleveland lew wasserman 
stein laid the groundwork for mcas dominance of the band 
business and emergence as the top agency for movie talent 
wasserman pushed the corporation into television and movie 
production tourist attractions and a myriad of enterprises 
though he deals in billions and is the confidant of presidents 
particularly former client ronald reagan wasserman has run the mca 
empire with a silken glove he eschews interviews and 
selfpromotion his biography in the motion picture almanac lists 
only his title as mca chairman 
until 1959 mca was known principally as the octopus because of 
its farreaching influence as a talent agency then the company 
took a giant step buying the venerable faltering universal 
pictures the justice department forced mca to exit the agency 
business or face antitrust charges 
universal pictures had been created by carl laemmle known as 
uncle carl because of his penchant for hiring relatives he was a 
pintsized scrapper who left the clothing business in oshkosh 
neb to open a nickelodeon in chicago in 1906 he soon built a 
theater chain then launched his own production company 
challenging the motion picture trust which demanded royalties for 
use of thomas edisons inventions 
the star system was started in 1910 when laemmle lured florence 
lawrence away from biograph with a salary of 200 a week he also 
hired little mary pickford in 1912 laemmle gathered in other 
independent companies to form universal pictures 
i hope im not making a mistake going out there said 
laemmle in a rare moment of selfdoubt as he moved his filmmaking 
to california he paid 165000 for a ranch on the north side of 
the hollywood hills and opened universal studios in 1915 
irving thalberg became studio manager in 1919 at 20 he was too 
young to sign the paychecks universal flourished in the 1920s with 
such stars as lon chaney and mae murray and directors such as john 
ford and erich von stroheim 
the studio specialized in westerns and horror classics included 
chaneys silent the hunchback of notre dame and the phantom 
of the opera and the talkies dracula and frankenstein 
the depression staggered universal and in 1936 laemmle was 
eased out of command in troubled times stars seemed to emerge to 
save universal from ruin in the 1930s it was soprano deanna 
durbin in the 1940s funnymen abbott and costello 
in 1946 the studio merged with the independent international 
pictures to become universalinternational the new management 
tried to upgrade the studios reputation with dramas like a 
double life and all my sons but the staples remained the ma 
and pa kettle and francis the talking mule series and sexandsand 
epics with maria montez and yvonne decarlo 
again the company faltered and in 1952 decca records gained 
control restoring the original name but universal couldnt 
weather a failing box office and in 1959 it acquired a new owner 
the music corporation of america 
stein besides practicing medicine played in local jazz bands 
he decided musicians needed an agency to strike them better deals 
with hotels ballrooms and speakeasies 
by the 1930s mca represented most of the name bands in the 
swing era and stein set his sights on bigger game hollywood 
steins chief aide lew wasserman proved a dynamo as head of 
mcas hollywood office and soon the agency represented a long list 
of stars including joan crawford errol flynn and alfred 
hitchcock 
as the major studios shunned television as an upstart 
competitor mca rushed in with its revue productions grinding out 
series like m squad and wagon train when ronald reagans 
film career faded wasserman found him work as host of general 
electric theater 
under wassermans guidance mcauniversal flourished in the 
1970s and 1980s the company became the biggest supplier of 
television entertainment universal studios tours grew to a major 
tourist attraction the feature film division sometimes faltered 
but steven spielberg emerged from television to direct the 
megahits jaws and et the extraterrestrial mca records 
also created huge profits 
mcauniversal has produced academy award winners the sting 
the deer hunter out of africa controversy the last 
temptation of christ and especially profits the latter made it 
highly attractive for a takeover or buyout as confirmed on 
tuesday

matsushita electric industrial co which got its 
start with a breakthrough automatic rice cooker is looking to 
bolster its consumer electronics business while moving into 
higherprofit industrial areas analysts say 
the companys products could stock an entire appliance store and 
then some radios tape recorders refrigerators air conditioners 
videocassette recorders and more 
some of its most widely recognized brands are panasonic 
technics and quasar 
matsushita electric confirmed it is negotiating to buy 
entertainment giant mca which has a vast library of movies and 
television programs in a deal valued at around 7 billion 
with its 163 consolidated subsidiaries matsushita electric 
forms japans third largest corporation and commands the largest 
share of japans home electronics market a morgan stanley survey 
in june ranked matsushita the 25thlargest publiclyheld 
corporation in the world 
it is also known to insiders as the matsushita bank 
reporting holdings of over 10 billion in cash assets alone last 
year total sales topped 416 billion 
the influence of legendary founder konosuke matsushita is felt 
in virtually every japanese home where an automatic rice cooker 
takes the drudgery out of preparing the nations staple food 
matsushita a man who never went to high school yet became 
japans most famous entrepreneur popularized the electric rice 
cooker in the 1950s in keeping with his corporate philosophy to 
manufacture items of good quality for daily use in abundant supply 
thereby enriching and improving life for everyone 
that comment in 1932 came a little less than 15 years after the 
23yearold matsushita left his employer to capitalize on his own 
electrical switch invention today the matsushita empire has 
spawned nearly 500 related firms operating in 36 countries 
during the 37 years it has operated in the united states 
matsushita has built 12 factories established seven sales 
companies and a research facility and employs some 10000 people 
but the company is now facing a crossroads over 60 percent of 
its sales have been concentrated in lowgrowth consumer products 
such as refrigerators and videocassette recorders compared to 
other japanese electronics makers it is having difficulty making 
the jump to more profitable industrial sectors analysts say 
it has also been unable to come up with a new hit product to 
take the place of the wildly successful vcr reflecting the 
companys strength in manufacturing capability over inventive 
prowess 
boris petersik an analyst for barclay de zoete wedd securities 
ltd notes that matsushitas mere size including its 25000 
affiliated retailers in japan has proved a burden to shifting its 
resources 
the group plans to change however it developed a longterm 
plan six years ago to focus on seven areas of high technology 
including computers semiconducters and communication technology 
by 1992 the company hopes those areas will account for 40 
percent of total sales 
this year the company has been investing huge amounts some 
400 billion japanese yen 32 billion in crystal displays 
computers and semiconductors it is also trying to develop 
profitable movie and television cameras for professional use 
petersik said 
but matsushita has had a hard time cracking sonys dominance on 
the professional market as well as its lead in the consumer market 
for vcrs sony now has the rich video software resources it 
purchased last year in its 5 billion acquisition of columbia 
pictures entertainment he said 
they dont want to lose completely on consumer products he 
said the mca acquisition if it goes through would both give the 
company access to software to keep its consumerproducts sales 
healthy and to studios where it could introduce its professional 
products 
software is going to be the critical factor in the video 
market martin beresford senior analyst at jardine fleming 
securities ltd said of the japanese companys possible mca 
purchase 
a company spokesman in tokyo said mca is only one of the 
companies with which matsushita is involved in talks but said 
nothing had been decided he said he could not comment further 
the acquisition also would indicate that the company is 
recovering from the death last year of the 94yearold company 
founder according to petersik 
revered as a visionary of japanese business matsushita was also 
one of japans richest men leaving an estate valued 17 billion 
and he was among japans most generous individuals in a country 
where charitable contributions do not qualify for tax breaks he 
established his own nonprofit foundation opened his factories to 
the handicapped and endowed cultural institutions and a private 
school for training future leaders

he founded that has fallen victim to financial problems stemming 
from a heavy debt load 
bond corp said in a statement that two other directors tony 
oates and peter mitchell also resigned as senior executives it 
said peter lucas had accepted an appointment as the new chairman of 
the board of directors 
the company said bond has been considering this course of 
action for some time 
bond oates and mitchell will act as consultants to the company 
until its proposed brewery sale and capital restructuring is 
completed bond corp said 
a spokesman said that after the restructuring and brewery sale 
were completed bond oates and mitchell would play no further role 
in the company in the direct management sense 
bond still retains a controlling interest in bond corp through 
his private company dallhold investments 
the resignation came earlier than expected bond said on july 20 
he would resign once european and british bond holders had accepted 
a bond brewing holdings ltd buyback offer the offer is yet to be 
accepted 
bond corp which reported an annual loss of 979 million 
australian dollars worth 815 million us at current exchange 
rates for the 198889 financial year has had to sell assets to 
reduce its crippling debt levels 
the brash flamboyant bond rose rapidly from humble roots his 
first job was as a sign painter at 14 by investing in land around 
perth and taking advantage of rapidly rising property values 
with a flair for picking the best development sites and 
promoting them well he was made his first million dollars by 1969 
at age 29 
he rode out the 1987 stock market crash on strong cash flow from 
his beer assets but the man who built a fortune by making the most 
of borrowed funds has been plagued by heavy debts rising interest 
rates and bad business decisions 
the combination alienated his bankers and creditors put his 
australian brewing interests into receivership and forced him to 
sell assets ranging from a hong kong development office to a coal 
mine 
unlike business rival robert holmes a court who died recently 
from a heart attack bond maintained a high public profile he 
probably is best known for financing the australian sailing teams

transportation to draw from the strategic petroleum reserve should 
a domestic shortage develop 
shugrue said those actions could reduce oil prices by 5 to 10 
per barrel right away crude oil futures prices have approached 40 
a barerel in recent days up from about 17 a barrel in july 
he said afterward that he plans to write letters to the white 
house and transportation department

america west airlines has confiemd it is in talks 
about the possible purchase of the pan am shuttle and for the 
backing of major aircraft manufacturers and leasing companies to 
finance the deal 
the new york times reported tuesday that guiness peat aviation 
the worlds largest aircraftleasing company and international 
aero engines a consortium of engine manufacturers would finance 
america wests purchase of the shuttle in exchange for the 
airlines agreement to buy or lease more than 100 airbus industrie 
a320 jets 
america west issued a statement tuesday confirming that it is 
holding talks with manufacturers and certain potential lessors 
for the acquisition of airbus a320 aircraft together with related 
financial support and aircraft purchase options 
however officials of the phoenixbased airline declined to 
discuss specifics 
the possible transaction has not been finalized and an 
appropriate announcement will be made if the transaction is 
consummated said michael j conway america west president 
he also confirmed that the airline has held talks with pan am 
but said the discussions are ongoing and have not resulted in any 
agreements 
the times put the purchase price at 200 million but conway 
said such speculation is premature and not well founded 
the pan am shuttle flies between new york and washington dc 
and new york and boston thomas plaskett chairman of pan am said 
last week that he expected to sell the shuttle by the end of the 
year although he declined to identify potential buyers 
america west tried last year to buy the trump shuttle which 
also serves the new yorkbostonwashington corridor but was unable 
to come up with the necessary financing 
airbus industrie a european aerospace consortium said last 
week that it and general electric co which makes engines for its 
jets had arranged for a 500 million loan for northwest airlines 
as part of a deal in which northwest would by 75 airbus jets 
alan boyd chairman of airbus north america said airbus would 
not loan any money to america west 
but the times quoted sources familiar with the talks as saying 
airbus was instrumental in arranging the financing for the 
shuttle purchase and said the deal could be closed as early as 
friday 
officials of guiness peat aviation and international aero 
engines delined comment 
america west chairman ed beauvais said last month that the 
airline was discussing the possible acquisition of an undisclosed 
number of a320 jets but refused to discuss details saying it 
would create needless speculation 
he also said the airline was trying to acquire more boeing 
737300s which make up the bulk of the carriers fleet of 92 
aircraft

american national can co has forged an agreement 
with du pont co to recycle rigid plastic bottles that recyclers 
often reject 
the pact should go a long way toward resolving one of the 
recycling industrys major problems finding someone to use the 
reconstituted product by guaranteeing a continuing supply 
one of the big remaining obsticles to increasing the reuse of 
plastics above the current rate of 1 percent to 2 percent is to 
improve the sorting process to segregate the various kinds of 
plastics said clifford klotz american national cans vice 
president and general manager for recycling 
now plastic is handsorted at a chicago area plant operated by 
the plastic recycling alliance a joint venture between du pont and 
waste management inc 
researchers are trying to find a way to speed up this process 
klotz said tuesday 
the economics of plastic recycling is not as good today as 
it will be a year from now he said 
in addition to the plastics agreement american national can 
also announced a pact with waste management of north america inc 
which will supply all types of presorted metal and glass 
containers 
american national can will melt them down to form new containers 
or sell the material to other manufacturers 
under both agreements trash will go through a preliminary 
presorting at the curbside when waste management picks it up 
the metal and glass recycling alliance will begin next year when 
when a final sorting and processing facility is completed in the 
chicago area 
at first waste management will provide trash from 140000 
homes 
the company serves 2 million households in more than 250 
communities nationwide although recycling in many of these towns 
is voluntary 
nonetheless american national can and waste management foresee 
eventually extending the program beyond the chicago area 
these recycling efforts will be extended throughout the united 
states and eventually throughout the world said jeanpierre 
ergas chief executive officer of american national can 
klotz said that except for plastic much of the recycling pays 
for itself through the value of the trash 
aluminum cans have been moneymakers for years he said 
steelcan recycling should pay for itself klotz said and so 
should glass if its handled efficiently 
he said its too early to project the quantity of recyclable 
materials the new pacts can be expected to generate 
david goeller a spokesman for environmental action said his 
group is always in favor of reuse 
we applaud more recycling but we also wold like to see less 
use of some of these items to start with particularly on the 
plastic end he said 
goeller said its difficult to make a specific assessment of the 
american national can projects without knowing more about them 
environmental action headquartered in washington is a national 
research and lobbying group

without a shortterm loan the city of 
philadelphia will be forced to live day to day on cash receipts 
until major property tax payments arrive in late february 
according to a city report 
in an analysis of the citys cash condition the finance 
directors office urged state and local political leaders tuesday 
to back its search for such a loan 
the city would in this event be insolvent the analysis 
said such a condition of insolvency has never happened to a 
major american city 
two of the citys three major taxes property and business 
privilege are due annually in the spring and the city has 
borrowed annually since 1972 to meet payroll and other obligations 
until those funds arrived 
a 375 million note offering was postponed sept 12 because it 
failed to attract investors 
the analysis said the offering was undercut by adverse 
publicity the lack of definitive public commitments at the state 
and local levels to find a permanent correction and the 
corresponding high degree of uncertainty about philadelphias 
fiscal future 
according to the analysis five steps are needed to regain 
access to the markets 
pledges from key state and local leaders to ensure that 
noteholders would be repaid 
clarification from city controller jonathan a saidel of his 
position on the need for seasonal cashflow borrowing 
demonstrated willingness by state and local leaders to find a 
longterm solution to the citys underlying fiscal problems 
at least a minimal commitment from state and local banks to 
back the notes 
action by the state on one of six proposals that would enhance 
the citys financial standing 
the proposals that would need state approval include 
longstanding requests for full state funding of statemandated 
human services programs a significant advance on state funds the 
city already is expected to get this fiscal year or state 
guarantees on the notes 
the other possibilities are passage of mandatory withholding of 
the citys wage tax from the paychecks of an estimated 25000 city 
residents who work in the suburbs passage of a local sales tax and 
approval of deficit financing 
the analysis also outlines various cashsaving steps it can take 
itself without a shortterm note including freezes in hiring 
payments to the city pension fund and repayment of an illegal 
realestate transfer tax 
mayor w wilson goode said last week the city could save 122 
million through such steps delaying until dec 1 the date when it 
would run out of cash 
for a longterm solution to the citys financial ills the 
analysis restated proposals goodes administration has pushed for 
two years 
the main elements still lacking the analysis said are a 
permanent funding source for the regional masstransit system tax 
reform and increased local taxes and additional state aid mostly 
for mandated human services programs

foreign banks have been setting up shop on us 
soil in increasing numbers over the years lending money to 
corporations investing in government securities even accepting 
deposits 
in many cases theyve been competing headon with 
americanowned banks 
now as many us banks retrench abroad and struggle with a 
slumping real estate market at home some critics charge foreign 
institutions are bullying their us counterparts in a financial 
freeforall 
they suggest foreign banks be bound by new controls but others 
say the current opendoor policy best serves the american 
consumers 
buoyed by the equaltreatment policies of the international 
banking act of 1978 overseas bankers have expanded their american 
operations by a startling 2800 percent since the early 1970s they 
rushed in to help finance the federal deficit and make commercial 
loans in a vast diversified market that offered new horizons for 
expansion 
meanwhile american banks reined in their international lending 
as some of their loans soured and capital considerations grew more 
urgent 
the 670 foreignowned bank branches agencies and subsidiaries 
account for nearly 30 percent of all outstanding commercial or 
business lending 
at the end of last year us assets of foreign banks totaled 
7357 billion compared with 261 billion in 1972 according to 
figures provided by the federal reserve about 55 percent of those 
assets are from japanese institutions the fed said 
real estate developer donald trump knows first hand the global 
power and importance of japanese banks he has been forced to knock 
on the doors of several japanese banks during his cash crunches 
this year 
in a recent report the nippon keizai shimbun japans premier 
financial newspaper claimed trump owes a third of his debts to 
japanese banks 
faramarz damanpour author of the recently published book the 
evolution of foreign banking institutions in the united states 
called the growing dependence on foreign banks alarming he 
suggests requiring a certain level of us participation in foreign 
banking operations 
if we do not please the japanese then we are at their 
mercy said damanpour a james madison university professor 
the similarity can be to the opec oil 
robert dugger chief economist of the washingtonbased american 
bankers association says foreign banks often act in concert with 
the fiscal policies of their home countries not those of the 
united states 
as a result they sometimes can draw on extra funds because of 
lower reserve requirements regulatory costs and deposit insurance 
premiums in many foreign lands he said the playing field is 
tipped significantly in their favor 
but lawrence r uhlick executive director of the new yorkbased 
institute of international bankers says foreign banks also have 
guidelines to follow 
he noted that the bank for international settlements which acts 
as a bank for central banks of major industrialized countries 
adopted riskbased capital standards two years ago the swissbased 
bank also set a march 1993 deadline for banks to hold capital equal 
to at least 8 percent of their loans and other assets he said 
uhlick said foreign bnnks provide healthy competition in lending 
and other banking services and additional financing to the us 
market they also boost international trade in part by financing 
us operations of businesses from their home countries he said 
a lot of people look at the size of the us business that has 
been done by banks around the world and they draw from that the 
conclusion that foreign banks are stealing us business somehow 
said james m stewart general manager of den danske bank a danish 
company with offices in new york and los angeles 
really thats not the case whats happening is that banks 
are bringing capital and a capacity to participate in transactions 
that would not otherwise be completed 
any effort to pass protectionist legislation will only backfire 
some say 
other markets may not remain open to american banks if the 
us restricts access of other countries banks to its market 
said uhlick id let the consumer decide how best their financial 
services are going to be met 
some bankers and lawmakers have called for deregulating the 
entire us banking system to unshackle both foreign and american 
institutions to develop a foundation to compete worldwide they 
say us banks must be given freedom to expand easily from state 
to state and to do insurance and securities business that is now 
offlimits to them 
if you cant go where other individuals can go if you cant 
do what other individuals can do that impedes your ability to 
compete said rep john lafalce dbuffalo ny a member of the 
house task force on international competitiveness 
one effort to rework the banking system is embodied in house 
bill 1992 it would allow creation of depository institution 
holding companies that could provide banking securities or 
insurance services though subsidiaries 
while that may help some banking experts say the problems 
facing us banks run much deeper 
we are losing our respect in financial and capital markets 
said damanpour 
he says that in the long term americans must improve their 
educational system rebuild the infrastructure and abandon what he 
views as an outmoded ethos of greed and easy living

stock prices sank today erasing the gains of 
the previous session as the pace of trading quickened 
the dow jones average of 30 industrials was down 3514 points at 
245050 at midday losing issues outpaced gainers by about 13 to 
4 with 1009 declining 311 advancing and 485 unchanged 
volume on the big board came to 8535 million shares as of noon 
on wall street against 7345 million shares at the same time 
tuesday 
stock prices opened mixed before the drift lower gathered 
momentum a turnaround in the energy market where oil price 
resumed their move upward and the nearterm crude contract again 
traded above 38 a barrel put pressure on stocks 
further traders continued to be concerned about the economy and 
the budget deficit the lack of agreement on a budgetreduction 
plan coupled with a 08 percent decline in durable goods orders in 
august brings everything back into light that things are not that 
good said james schroederade the effort to open channels of communication 
between the military and civilians 
any armchair general is entitled to speculate about what 
military actions the united states might take if the attempt to 
starve iraq out of kuwait fails dugan however was no armchair 
general he was the real thing 
anything he said as air force chief of staff carried the weight 
of an inside opinion the musings of someone with access to 
highlevel planning even if dugans assessment that us planes 
would bomb baghdad and specifically target iraqi president saddam 
hussein wasnt official the damage had been done 
defense secretary dick cheney who fired dugan said that 
discussion of likely military targets inside iraq violates pentagon 
policy furthermore dugan may have disclosed classified 
information about the size of us forces in the gulf area 
despite the charges however it seems unlikely that dugan 
disclosed anything that iraq had not considered already even a 
layman would guess that the united states would rely heavily on air 
strikes in a region where its ground troops are outnumbered 
if the united states does resort to force it also seems likely 
that one of its primary objectives will be to cripple iraqs war 
machine and cut supply lines to kuwait all from the air if 
possible 
and finally it should be no surprise that sending planes to gun 
for hussein is a possibility after all one of the objectives of 
the bombing raid on libya allegedly was to kill moammar gadhafi 
pentagon officials chiefs of staff and highranking military 
officers cant say that however for one thing the president is 
forbidden from sanctioning official assassinations for another it 
is foolish for members of the us military to discuss their 
options in public 
its a bad ending for a fine career but with that much 
experience in how the military works dugan should have known 
better 
 
sept 21 
bakersfield calif californian on the firing of gen michael 
dugan 
in one respect it is sad to see the distinguished military 
career of former air force chief of staff michael j dugan go down 
in inglorious flames as a result of a single lapse of judgment but 
of all people a fourstar general should know better than to 
discuss with the press specific targets in the event of war in the 
persian gulf 
all considered defense secretary dick cheney was justified in 
firing general dugan for thoughtless remarks that subsequently were 
printed in the los angeles times and the washington post 
dugan told three reporters during a trip to saudi arabia that 
the joint chiefs of staff had concluded that the only effective 
military option for driving iraqi forces out of kuwait was heavy 
bombing of baghdad to decapitate the senior iraqi leadership 
making saddam hussein his family and palace guards primary 
targets 
any buck private has the common sense not to publicize battle 
plans by discussing possible targets the general has warned 
saddam hussein to fortify the sites hell likely place american 
hostages in targeted areas 
its hard to believe that a ranking officer molded by 32 years 
of military discipline would succumb to loose talk as the nation 
prepares for possible war the general had to be silenced

the mesa ariz tribune on david souter 
a reporter asked former supreme court justice warren e burger 
if it is proper for the senate judiciary committee to ask supreme 
court nominee david souter about abortion burger was emphatic not 
only would it be improper to ask it would be improper for souter 
to answer 
such a remark is not surprising coming from a nixonappointed 
conservative but burger is correct the committees duty is to 
oversee the selection of a judge not a politician if the senators 
insist on unveiling souters feelings on abortion they not only 
will flout the intent of the court they will lay a distressing 
groundwork for selecting future jurists 
the contrast between souter and those measuring his character 
are stark indicators that we dont want a politician on the bench 
compare the quiet dignity of souter to his inquisitors he has 
lived a life of scholarly seclusion driven by a passion for 
history and the law 
the prochoice members of the judiciary committee have an 
opportunity to teach the american people the distinction between 
the court and the congress the two have different jobs 
politicians create laws judges interpret them the callings are 
different and so too must be their approach to the law 
committee chairman joseph biden wasted little time getting to 
abortion he danced on the periphery with questions on civil rights 
and the implied rights of privacy the foundation on which roe vs 
wade is built 
but souter wouldnt budge he told the senator repeatedly it 
would be improper for him to reveal his inner feelings about a case 
that might soon be before him 
if we choose judges based on how theyll vote on the hot issues 
of the day we compromise the independence of the judiciary

valley news lebanon nh on politicians 
polling around the country earlier this summer showed rising 
disaffection with the parties themselves and incumbents generally 
 
and there are other indications of disenchantment with the 
status quo in oklahoma voters agreed to limit the terms of state 
legislators 
polling by the washington post and abc news suggests that the 
electorate may be remarkably willing to shop around this fall for 
congressional candidates undermining the theory tha the enhanced 
powers of modern incumbency are creating the socalled permanent 
congress 
first and most obviously its axiomatic that people vote their 
pocketbook as the economy slumps and state budget woes rise 
members of the political establishment may begin to pay for the 
prosperity of the 80s that rendered their incumbency almost 
unassailable

oil prices rallied late this morning on fears of 
war in the persian gulf wiping out an early decline that was 
attributed to a report of higher supplies of gasoline and heating 
oil 
were hearing rumors that saddam wants the us out of saudi 
arabia within 48 hours said trader brian tagler of shearson 
lehman brothers inc thats whats causing the rally 
light sweet crude was trading up 27 cents at 3780 per barrel 
for november delivery contracts on the new york mercantile exchange 
shortly before noon other crude contract months were mixed 
earlier today oil had fallen more than 1 per barrel as traders 
responded to the release on tuesday evening of american petroleum 
institute statistics that showed supplies of the refined petroleum 
products had risen 
at the opening the market was paying less attention to a un 
action on tuesday night authorizing an extension of the embargo of 
iraq and kuwait to cover airways as well as the sea some traders 
had thought that move would push prices up this morning but oil 
opened lower in apparent response to the weekly api report 
gasoline and heating oil also fell in early trading today but 
heating oil rallied along with crude oil around midday 
heating oil moved up 30 cent to 1015 per gallon on october 
contracts shortly before noon but the october contract for 
unleaded gasoline was down 245 cents at 9960 cents per gallon 
later months were mixed for both refined products 
natural gas prices were also mixed late this morning with 
november contracts trading just before noon at 193 per 1000 
cubic feet the same as tuesdays close 
traders viewed the markets decline early in the morning as a 
continuation of tuesdays dip which followed a dramatic surge in 
prices on monday 
when crude oil soared briefly above 39 per barrel monday 
people on the floor of the exchange were saying 40 was their next 
target 
we havent heard talk of that lately but all you need is some 
war rhetoric and that talk will come right back said sal 
gilbertie a trader with merrill lynch energy futures 
the api report that was moving the market on its open showed 
that crude imports and stocks fell last week as did imports and 
production of gasoline and distillates which include home heating 
oil 
refinery capacity was also down last week although the nations 
stockpiles of gasoline and distillates were higher api said in its 
weekly statistics 
crude imports were at 57 million barrels per day down from 60 
million barrels daily a week earlier but up from 56 million 
barrels a day a year ago crude oil stocks stood at 3640 million 
barrels down from 3698 million barrels a week earlier but up from 
3309 million barrels a year earlier 
gasoline imports were down to 215000 barrels per day from 
282000 barrels per day a week earlier and 313000 barrels per day 
a year earlier gasoline stocks were higher at 2223 million

2192 million barrels a year earlier 
distillate imports were down to 220000 barrels per day from 
394000 barrels per day a week earlier and 278000 barrels per day

day a year earlier distillate production was down to 29 million

group it was clear that the allies who were expected to put up the 
cash had a number of objections to the outline of the effort 
unveiled by bush on tuesday 
the disputes ranged from such basic issues as how much money 
should be contributed to which countries should receive the 
assistance there were also debates over what mechanisms to use to 
disburse the funds 
treasury secretary nicholas brady expressed the hope today that 
the various questions could be resolved telling global finance 
ministers in a speech that they needed to forge a united economic 
front against saddam hussein 
the economic strength represented by all of you in this room 
must be mobilized to demonstrate collective resolve and make clear 
our intention not to yield to aggression brady said 
officials said that while the united states was pushing for more 
than 14 billion in assistance for the frontline states of turkey 
egypt and jordan and other hardhit countries some european 
countries were insisting that a much smaller amount of around 9 
billion was all that was needed 
saudi arabia reportedly was objecting to including jordan as a 
beneficiary country until jordan moved more forcefully to close its 
borders to trade with iraq 
president bush put forward his proposal for the crisis 
coordination group during an address tuesday to the opening 
sessions of the 154nation international monetary fund and its 
sister organization the world bank 
while officials of the large donor countries indicated general 
support for a coordinating group they let it be known that many of 
the details remained to be worked out 
british chancellor of the exchequer john major told reporters 
that it was possible that a working group session today would be 
unable to resolve all the outstanding issues and would end up 
bucking the dispute to a later meeting of finance ministers 
it is clearly sensible for the world to get together and 
determine what should be the elements of assistance how much it 
should be and how that should be divided among the donor nations 
major said 
officials of japan which already has pledged 4 billion more 
than any other country outside of oilrich persian gulf nations 
indicated they had questions as well on how the informal 
coordinating council would work 
president bush gave one idea whether it will go ahead will 
depend on the response of the countries involved japanese 
finance minister ryutaro hashimoto told reporters late tuesday 
in his speech bush noted the refugee crisis as well as 
unemployment problems and serious economic disruptions resulting 
from rising oil prices 
this staggering burden which is pressing upon those most 
seriously affected countries calls for a generous response from 
the world community the president told the finance officials 
the political leadership of the un must be matched by the 
economic leadership of the imf and world bank he said 
the united states has been trying for a month to mobilize 
financial support to pay the cost of the us military buildup in 
the persian gulf and to compensate countries harmed by the un 
trade embargo against iraq 
the administration fears that the sanctions against iraq could 
begin to unravel without substantial economic assistance 
the united states has obtained pledges of 20 billion from the 
allies divided equally between support for the military effort and 
assistance for the three countries hardest hit by the turmoil 
turkey egypt and jordan the socalled frontline states 
however a west german official who briefed reporters on 
condition of anonymity said the united states now was seeking 
145 billion in aid for the frontline states up from an initial 
estimate of 105 billion earlier this month 
the german official said some european countries questioned 
whether this amount overstated the need he said his country also 
would like to see the donor pool widened to include such nations as 
switzerland and sweden 
in a fact sheet released by the white house the countries 
expected to participate with the united states in the crisis 
coordination group included japan west germany britain france 
canada italy saudi arabia kuwait the united arab emirates 
qatar and south korea 
in addition representatives of the 12nation european community 
were being included in the discussions along with the gulf 
cooperation council of persian gulf countries 
the administration received assurances monday from 
policysetting panels of the imf and the world bank that both 
agencies stood ready to accelerate their lending activities in 
order to cushion the economic fallout from the doubling of world 
oil prices 
while the administration has focused its fundraising efforts 
primarily on egypt turkey and jordan officials of the imf and the 
world bank say they expect to provide aid to many other third world 
nations that have been hurt by rising oil prices the loss of 
export markets and a flood of refugees from iraq and kuwait

prosecutors seeking a stiff prison term for 
michael milken released their longawaited arguments to the 
sentencing judge today urging her to concentrate on the convicted 
financiers sweeping and serious crimes 
the 200page memorandum to us district judge kimba m wood 
exhorted her to pay scant attention to milkens good deeds and 
instead consider evidence that he was a systematic crook 
the courts sentence must demonstrate that persons who possess 
great wealth and prominence cannot expect that their privilege or 
their money will insulate them from certain and serious 
punishment said the document signed by acting us attorney 
roger hayes 
it was released a day after milkens highpowered legal team 
released their own recommendations to the judge who is scheduled 
to pronounce sentence monday on the most celebrated defendant in 
the securities fraud scandals that rocked wall street in the 1980s 
the defense lawyers have urged the judge to weigh milkens 
generosity and philanthropy and spare him from prison they suggest 
alternatively that milken be ordered to work fulltime with youths 
in the drugplagued ghettos of los angeles 
he faces a maximum 28 years in prison on six felony counts to 
which he earlier pleaded guilty including conspiracy securities 
fraud and tax violations 
his good works however commendable should not shield him 
from incarceration the prosecution memorandum said milken is 
guilty of sweeping and serious crimes he should be sentenced to a 
substantial term of imprisonment 
the prosecution cannot recommend a specific prison term and 
wood has wide discretion in passing sentence but many legal 
experts expect the 44yearold extrader of drexel burnham lambert 
inc junk bonds to do time 
wood ordered the release of sentencing memorandums earlier this 
week because of the enormous public interest in the milken case 
but she instructed the two sides to edit the documents to delete 
incriminating references to milken associates 
milken abandoned claims of innocence in april and agreed to a 
plea bargain that spared him from a much wider indictment and 
assumes his cooperation with prosecutors in other probes 
but in sentencing the defense has opposed the prosecutions 
effort to portray milken as a conniving criminal mastermind who 
committed more crimes than he had admitted in their recommendation 
to wood they asked her to view milkens transgressions as an 
aberration in an otherwise exemplary life 
michael should be sentenced based on the offenses to which he 
pleaded guilty the defense papers said he should not be 
sentenced for crimes that he did not commit he should not be 
sentenced on charges for which the government expressly has 
foregone prosecution in return for his guilty plea 
lead defense attorney arthur liman wrote that hundreds of 
letters from milken relatives friends and clients portrayed him as 
a benevolent capitalist hardworking family man and a person of 
great conscience compassion and charity who has always been 
generous with his time money and spirit 
the lawyer also asserted milken already has been punished 
severely by relentless public scrutiny payment of a record 600 
million in fines and penalties and a bleak future fighting civil 
lawsuits 
michael milken is a changed person he will be tormented for 
the remainder of his life by the realization that his family was 
devastated his reputation destroyed and his lifes work tainted by 
virtue of his having committed these acts liman wrote 
the defense also denied suggestions that milken played any role 
in the decline of the nations savings and loans which were among 
some of his most prominent clients on the contrary sampl holdings 
of junk bonds below investment grade were among their most 
profitable investments the defense contended 
it also rejected allegations of insider trading against milken 
including trades of securities in caesars world viacom republic 
airlines and lorimar noting that those charges had been refuted 
earlier 
milkens guilty plea did not include any counts related to 
trading on the basis of nonpublic information the defense also 
minimized the extent of his association with ivan boesky the 
convicted inside trader who was milkens chief accuser 
indeed the government even secured an indictment of mr 
milken on some of the transactions for which it now acknowledges 
that it does not have and never did have any evidence of mr 
milkens involvement the defense documents said

a former board member of the failed silverado 
savings and loan association who refused to testify at neil bushs 
conflictofinterest hearing has changed his mind and will testify 
thursday officials said today 
florian barth was to have been the third witness at the office 
of thrift supervision hearing that opened tuesday but he refused 
to appear 
today government counsel stephen hershkowitz told 
administrative law judge daniel j davidson that barth had decided 
to testify and would appear before the hearing thursday morning 
davidson on tuesday had said he would sign a subpoena to force 
barths appearance if he did not appear voluntarily 
tuesdays hearing was highlighted by former silverado chairman 
michael wise invoking the fifth amendment 14 times 
another silverado executive meanwhile testified the thrifts 
board of directors knew of bushs business relationship with 
kenneth good when it granted good a nocollateral 900000 line of 
credit 
the testimony came tuesday during the hearing on whether to bar 
bush from the financial industry for his actions as a silverado 
director 
the federal office of thrift supervision has alleged that bush 
as a silverado director improperly voted on loans and credit for 
good and bill walters both of whom contributed to bushs oil and 
gas exploration company 
the two businessmen defaulted on more than 132 million in loans 
from the thrift silverado collapsed in late 1988 at a cost to 
taxpayers of 1 billion 
today attorneys were to reexamine defense witness geoffrey c 
hazard jr a yale law professor who says bush acted legally when 
dealing with good and walters 
president bushs 35yearold son did not attend the opening 
session he is scheduled as the final witness at the hearing 
expected to end thursday 
bush could have avoided a hearing by agreeing not to dispute the 
charges as other sampl officials have done by fighting the 
government he has taken the case into a rare public forum 
as the hearing opened silverados former chief executive 
officer wise invoked his fifth amendment right against 
selfincrimination 
davidson let wise testify in the judges chambers to be spared 
the ordeal of going through a futile gesture of taking the fifth 
but in the chambers wise still took the fifth 14 times 
he gave only his name and wichita kan address according to a 
transcript later released he wouldnt comment as he left the 
courthouse 
another witness russell murray a former silverado executive 
vice president who reviewed the 1986 proposal for a 900000 line 
of credit for good international inc testified he did not recall 
anyone questioning it even though good and bush had a business 
relationship 
he said he discussed the request with bush good and wise and 
then wrote a memo to the thrifts directors about the relationship 
before they approved the line of credit 
but he said he did not have all the details of the relationship 
and that he would have asked for a legal opinion if he had had all 
the facts 
last week the federal deposit insurance corp sued bush and 
other former silverado directors for 200 million the lawsuit 
which also named wise and barth alleged gross negligence on the 
part of silverado directors contributed to the sampls collapse

president bush may be willing to compromise on 
his call for a capital gains tax cut the main sticking point in 
talks to slash the federal deficit republican members of congress 
who met with the president said today 
instead of reducing the rate on capital gains taxes bush might 
accept other incentives to economic growth the lawmakers said 
he might be willing to look at alternatives in the growth 
area said senate minority leader bob dole rkan as he and 
other gop lawmakers left the white house 
but bush and gop lawmakers warned that without democratic 
concessions at ongoing budget talks no deal would be reached in 
time to avoid 85 billion in federal spending cuts that the 
grammrudman deficitreduction law will impose on monday 
bush at a political fundraiser today in akron ohio 
criticized congressional democrats saying its their fault for 
holding up getting a budget agreement 
we will continue to press hard for incentives for capital 
investment bush said however he did not further discuss his 
longstanding insistence on a capital gains tax reduction as part of 
any budget agreement 
without an agreement by monday the start of the new budget 
year the government faces the possibility of mass disruptions of 
services and furloughs of many of the two million federal civilian 
employees 
it can be avoided if they do what they should bush told 
reporters aboard air force one en route to ohio its the 
congress i would now say the democrats in congress have not come 
forward with a package 
there are a couple of points now where the democrats need to 
move said dole he said he was referring to economic incentives 
dole and house republican leader robert michel already have said 
they would be willing to put aside bushs proposal to cut the 
capital gains tax rate in order to get a budget agreement 
rep newt gingrich rga the no 2 house republican said the 
incentives bush might be willing to accept include tax breaks for 
businesses to encourage research and investment and a proposal to 
establish socalled enterprise zones the zones would provide tax 
breaks for businesses in poor urban and rural areas 
while hes going to be very flexible and hes willing to look 
at a democratic offer he wants part of this final agreement to be 
a growth package gingrich said 
hes willing to negotiate every item thats been advanced 
said sen thad cochran rmiss when asked if bush was now ready 
to bargain on the question of capital gains 
both michel and dole said they would be willing to put the 
capital gains cut in order to get an agreement to slash the budget 
deficit over five years by 500 billion asked by reporters about 
the gop defections bush refused to answer 
earlier negotiators for congress and the white house claimed 
some progress early today in their talks 
i think we made some headway dole told reporters after the 
eighthour closeddoor session asked for details he refused 
saying i dont want to blow the whole thing up 
its still going to be tough to get an agreement enacted 
into law before the oct 1 start of the new budget year said 
richard g darman director of the white house office of management 
and budget 
asked whether the bush administration was ready to drop its 
demand for a cut in taxes on capital gains darman scoffed dont 
be ridiculous 
just before the bargaining resumed tuesday evening michel 
signaled a willingness to drop the capitalgains cut which has 
been a top priority of president bush since his 1988 campaign 
for his money michel said the doggone price of a 
capitalgains cut is too steep 
democratic leaders who have been resisting a capitalgains cut 
because 80 percent of the direct benefit would go to those with 
incomes over 100000 a year have insisted they will go along only 
if taxes on the wealthy are raised in some other fashion to pay for 
the cut 
capital gains which are profits from the sale of investments 
now are taxed at the same rates as ordinary income bush says they 
should be given a lower rate to encourage investment 
michels senate counterpart dole earlier had expressed his own 
misgivings about sticking to the capitalgains demand so long that 
it threatened a deficit agreement the reduction is still a sound 
idea he said but you just cant keep everything on hold in an 
attempt to win it 
the governments financial woes are complicated by the fact only 
five days before the new year none of the 13 annual appropriations 
bills has been enacted 
the democraticcontrolled house appropriations approved a bill 
tuesday aimed at giving negotiators 20 days past the oct 1 
deadline to write a deficitcutting plan 
the continuing resolution approved by the panel with all 
but one republican dissenting would continue spending generally 
at current levels until oct 20 and block any of the scheduled 
acrosstheboard spending cuts until after that date 
bush repeated his vow to veto any legislation that delayed the 
spending cuts without a longterm deficitcutting agreement

the resignation was expected bond had said in july he would 
step down to appease the companys creditors who are owed an 
estimated 6 billion 
bond corp said in a statement that two other directors tony 
oates and peter mitchell had also resigned while director peter 
lucas will become the new chairman 
bond oates and mitchell will act as consultants until the 
companys proposed brewery sale and capital restructuring is 
completed a spokesman said the three would play no further role in 
the company in the direct management sense after the 
restructuring and sale are finished 
bond still retains a controlling interest in bond corp through 
his private company dallhold investments 
bond corp which reported a loss of 979 million australian 
dollars or 815 million for the 198889 financial year has had 
to sell assets to reduce its crippling debt levels 
the resignation ends a long fall for the brash flamboyant bond 
who rose rapidly from humble roots by investing in land around 
perth and taking advantage of rapidly rising property values 
he emigrated to perth from britain with his father quit school 
at age 14 and took a job with a signpainting company when things 
didnt work out he and his father started a competitor nusigns 
that provided the cash for some of his later deals 
with a flair for picking the best real estate development sites 
and promoting them he was successful enough to make his first 
million by 1969 at age 29 he took advantage of eager bankers 
peddling expensive credit particularly after australias financial 
deregulation in 1983 and a stock market full of hungry investors 
at its peak bond corp holdings had interests in brewing 
media natural resources and property its best known us business 
is g heileman brewing co a la crosse wisbased company he 
bought in 1987 for 13 billion 
bond rode out the 1987 stock market crash on the cashgenerating 
strength of his beer businesses 
but the man who built a fortune by making the most of borrowed 
funds has been plagued by heavy debts rising interest rates and 
bad business decisions 
the combination alienated his bankers and creditors put his 
australian brewing interests into receivership and forced him to 
sell assets ranging from a hong kong development office to a coal 
mine 
unlike business rival robert holmes a court who died recently 
from a heart attack bond maintained a high public profile he 
probably is best known for financing the australian sailing teams 
stunning triumph over the united states in the 1983 americas cup 
race 
only three years ago he bought vincent van goghs irises 
from sothebys for a record 539 million a sale that the auction 
house helped him finance in march he sold the painting for an 
undisclosed amount amid reports he had taken a loss 
bonds resignation does come a bit earlier than expected he had 
said he would resign once european and britis bond holders had 
accepted a bond brewing holdings ltd buyback offer the offer has 
yet to be accepted

vendors across the country went on 
brief symbolic strikes wednesday to protest government plans to 
sell their shops in auctions 
the expected sale will be the beginning of a comprehensive 
privatization process the cornerstone of the ongoing economic 
reform aimed at transforming the stateowned system of command 
economy into a westernstyle market mechanism 
the heads of the federal government and the czech and slovak 
republics plan to meet thursday with president vaclav havel in the 
moravian city of kromeriz 180 miles east of prague to complete 
work on the wording of the privatization law 
the law must then go to parliament for approval 
in the first round of what the government dubbed small 
privatization original owners may reclaim shops confiscated 
after the communists seized power in 1948 and nationalized private 
property 
shops and small enterprises not claimed by former owners will 
then be offered either to their employees or auctioned off to the 
highest bidder 
while an outsider will have to pay for the shop within seven 
days of the purchase a current employee will be given five years 
to pay up to 50 percent of the price 
this measure is designed to give vendors incentive to take over 
their shops and to compensate for the lack of cash available to buy 
enterprises outright 
vendors have protested the provision demanding a clear first 
priority on shops to be sold off 
if a guy comes to the auction and puts half a million crowns 
on the table there is no way i can compete with him even if i have 
state credit i can never handle a transaction worth that much 
money said vitezslav klement a vegetable vendor in pragues 
working class district of smichov 
shops to the vendors not moneychangers and communist 
mafia read a sign across an antiques shop window wednesday 
shops shut down for anything between five minutes to an hour in 
wednesdays protest strike against the privatization laws 
large savings were exceptional in czechoslovakias centrally 
planned economy where monthly wages averaged 3200 crowns or 
about 200 
those who thrived on the black market and other components of 
the shadow economy tolerated by communists have saved millions 
often in convertible currencies stashed in western banks 
shop vendors claim the auctions would put an abrupt end to the 
already poor network of food and services with the new owners 
likely to switch to the sale of electronics and other consumer 
goods that turn a fast profit 
the government says the most important thing is to privatize the 
economy as quickly as possible the government of the czech 
republic wants small privatization completed by dec 31 
its not so important who gets the actual shop what matters 
is the earliest possible occurrence of private ownership without 
which a free society cannot exist the mlada fronta daily which 
is known for its support of the reforms of finance minister vaclav 
klaus said wednesday 
privatization of large industrial plants and the agricultural 
sector is expected to start in early 1991 when the legislative 
framework giving access to foreign capital is ready and prices are 
decontrolled

meridian bancorp inc plans to boost its 
loanloss reserves by 75 million and shed its credit card and 
title insurance businesses amid signs of a weakening economy 
the bank holding company said the moves would allow it to focus 
on and expand its core banking businesses 
meridian said it expects to announce next month a net loss of 
35 million to 39 million for the quarter ending sunday or about 
86 cents to 96 cents per share during last years third quarter 
meridian made 225 million or 56 cents a share 
most of the loss would stem from the addition to loanloss 
reserves and a charge of 15 million to 175 million related to 
the sale of the title operations meridian said 
we expect to return to normal levels of profitability in the 
fourth quarter to be profitable for all of 1990 and to continue 
the payment of dividends at current levels said samuel a 
mccullough chairman and chief executive officer 
meridian said it had reevaluated its loan portfolios in 
response to the weakening economy in general and the real estate 
sector in particular 
the reserve for possible loan losses will be increased to about 
165 million or about 2 percent of loans outstanding 
goldman sachs amp co will arrange the sale of the title 
operations which had losses of 73 million for the six months 
ending june 30 
the company decided to sell its 300 million portfolio of credit 
card receivables because of high overhead potential legislative 
restraints and the need for costly technology mccullough said 
meridian also said it would convert 300 million of indirect 
automobile loan receivables to marketable securities to improve its 
capital ratios and reduce reliance on external funding

agriculture minister henri nallet on wednesday 
announced an emergency aid program intended to curtail the wave of 
demonstrations and truck hijackings by farmers protesting 
lowpriced meat imports 
the centerpiece of the program will be a 270 million 14 
billion franc fund to assist farmers in debt because of foreign 
competition or a prolonged drought in france 
special protection would be given farmers over the age of 55 
nallet said the government would seek to ensure they are not put 
out of business for nonpayment of debts 
earlier in the day riot police protecting premier michel rocard 
hurled tear gas grenades at protesting farmers who pelted the 
officers with eggs tomatoes and bottles 
in the town of valence 500 sheep farmers protested outside a 
fairgrounds where rocard was to address a communications forum 
about 1000 police officers blocked the protesters from 
entering officers used tear gas grenades after being pelted 
some farmers tried to drive tractors through the barriers while 
others set fire to tires to block the entrance to a local 
government building 
rocard who flew to the fairgrounds by helicopter said in his 
speech that the protesters hurt their own cause by giving 
themselves a bad image and complicating efforts to aid their 
industry 
in recent weeks angry french farmers have staged dozens of 
demonstrations nationwide and hijacked numerous livestock trucks 
carrying imported animals hundreds of cows and sheep have been 
killed in some cases burned alive during the hijackings

to those who think debt is a dirty word the 
modern day r h macy amp co story wouldnt be fit for a feelgood 
hollywood film 
a number of outsiders believe the 132yearold retailers future 
is more precarious now on the eve of an expectedly bleak 
christmas shopping season than at any time since it went private 
in 1986 
macys some skeptics say might need something like divine 
intervention to shoulder its heavy debt burden while losing support 
from retail revenue 
not so say macys executives they acknowledge christmas 1990 
wont go down as one of the merrier holidays in history but a 
consumer spending slump wont put macys on the ropes because the 
retailer is ready for it they say 
we would feel very positive other than the fact that it is a 
very soft economy out there edward s finkelstein chairman and 
chief executive officer said in an interview at the retailers 
headquarters atop the manhattan flagship immortalized in the movie 
miracle on 34th street 
its hard to be euphoric when the economy is this lousy so i 
wouldnt describe my attitude as euphoric but i have never felt 
better about our organization finkelstein said 
he was joined in the interview by the two other members of his 
management troika mark s handler president and chief operating 
officer and myron e ullman executive vice president and chief 
financial officer 
inventories are 400 million below last years bloated level and 
the yeartoyear expense increase has been shaved to 1 percent 
finkelstein said noting the retailer has planned for sales to be 
flat or even a bit lower than last years expenses rose 7 percent 
in 1989 from 1988 
outsiders arent as confident macys has been begging for 
business by hyping merchandise at reduced prices this suggests the 
company is desperate for sales to generate cash needed to cover 
payments on debts incurred in its 374 billion leveraged buyout 
and afterward say analysts who arent privy to macys inside 
information 
just as the backtoschool season was starting macys 
advertisements for special price breaks on childrens clothing 
blared over the airwaves and leaped from newspapers 
in september typically a transitional time in retailing when 
stores gear up for the climax of their selling years macys 
advertised a series of sales on bedding womens clothing 
accessories fine jewelry oriental rugs etc 
merchandise also is marked down without fanfare macys makes a 
habit of hosting unannounced sale events possibly to encourage 
shoppers to stop by regularly to see whats on sale according to 
kurt barnard publisher of a new yorkbased retailing newsletter 
consultants contend macys obsession with sales has caused the 
retailer to crowd its promotional calendar 
this compounds the problem of sale syndrome an irksome 
phenomenon for retailers caused by customers who have grown so 
accustomed to markdowns that they almost never expect to pay full 
price anymore 
finkelstein disagreed and said the retailer has curbed its 
promotional activity especially compared to last year when stores 
fell over each other marking down merchandise the price war was 
started last year by campeau corps federated and allied us 
department store chains which succumbed to bankruptcy court in 
january 
macys has 10 percent fewer promotions this year than last and 
conducts fewer oneday sales finkelstein said he blasted 
predictions that this christmas macys must slash prices and push 
merchandise as aggressively as it did a year ago 
there is absolutely no reason we have to trash ourselves in 
spite of what knownothing uninformed observers say he fumed 
fiesty finkelstein clearly has no patience with speculation that 
he thinks lacks facts he said reports criticizing macys for 
everything from sloppy shopkeeping to tardy billpaying practices 
are unfair 
im convinced that most of the people who trash our stores 
either havent been in them dont shop them or dont know what the 
hell is going onhe said 
he is annoyed that more mention isnt made of positive 
developments 
business is going better in texas and florida than elsewhere in 
the country for instance while macys bullocks inc chain has 
had strong business without the need for powerpacked promoting he 
said 
macys gets high marks for keeping interested parties up to 
date a few months ago senior macys executives huddled with 
vendors and other creditors to provide evidence of its billpaying 
ability 
an executive with a womens apparel manufacturer which supplies 
large volumes to macyowned department stores confirmed the 
retailer pays promptly the executive speaking on condition of 
anomymity said the trade lately has more faith in macys 
all of us are feeling more comfortable than we were three or 
four months ago he said everyone has always felt that the 
people who run macys were among the most outstanding retail 
executives in the country the question was had they bitten off 
more than they could chew 
some of the concern in the trade and financial community 
subsided after macys made it clear it was trimming its annual 
interest bill of 595 million at about 10 percent of sales macys 
interest tab is one of the highest in the industry 
macys longterm debt amounts to 48 billion at peak times 
during the year macys total debt load is about 56 billion 
ullman said 
macys used some of the 15 million it obtained by selling a 1 
percent equity stake in august to buy back a portion of the 16 
billion of its outstanding junk bonds further bond buybacks are 
planned taking the opportunity to cheaply retire debt that 
currently is selling at substantial discounts of around 50 cents on 
the dollar and lower 
finkelstein said macys will consider selling up to 20 percent 
of the company and use the proceeds to cut interest expenses the 
odds are good that a stake of some size will be sold in the next 
three to six months he said 
but macys has no intention of parting with retail assets it is 
exploring more possible sales of nonretail holdings such as real 
estate finkelstein said 
doubting thomases dont believe macys merchandising clout 
strong market position and consumer identification will 
automatically spare it from misery if christmas is as bad as 
doomsters foresee 
forecasts of operating profit or income before interest taxes 
depreciation and amortization have been scaled back for the six 
months ending jan 31 but estimates still are well above the 
dismal 416 million macys had in operating profit in the same 
period a year earlier and profit margins are expected to improve 
finkelstein doesnt delude himself about how tough his job will 
be in a prolonged economic slump 
we may have to be running this business with tight economies 
with tight expense control for as much as two years he said

rising fears of war in the middle east 
wheat futures rose amid unconfirmed rumors that an iraqi jet had 
been shot down in the persian gulf and rumors that the government 
might be interested in offering subsidized flour to the soviet 
union 
choppy trading throughout the day reflected a growing 
nervousness that the middle east crisis could not be solved 
diplomatically said john frazier director of the agricultural 
division for gerald inc

she said she was primarily interested in nutrition but you 
quickly find out that what youre really doing is supporting the 
small farmer and in the long run helping maintain a regional food 
belt 
in a study robert sommer director of the center for consumer 
research at the university of californiadavis found that people 
shop at farmers markets for highquality food lower prices and 
atmosphere in that order 
in the old days people went to the dump now they go to the 
farmers market its become a big social event said august 
schumacher outgoing commissioner of food and agriculture in 
massachusetts 
market shopping is really a form of entertainment you 
dont go to an openair farmers market because its convenient 
said hilary baum of public markets collaborative 
all year every wednesday friday and saturday dozens of 
growers do business in manhattan at union square park once a 
haven for drug dealers and provide more than ample atmosphere 
amid fragrant waisthigh stalks of basil chef demonstrations 
tours and tastings 
one recent day shoppers could choose white eggplant cider 
peaches apples okra sour cherries squash blossoms raspberries 
eggs chickens bursting sunflowers and apple and blueberry pies 
a woman at a fish stand hands out cards with a number to call a 
day ahead to find out what kinds of fish will be spread out on ice 
the next morning the blews who farm in pittstown nj offered 
13 kinds of peppers 
new york citys markets range from the sprawling union square 
market where benepe said growers can make up to 10000 a day 
to one on the lower east side six farmers once a week farmers pay 
less than 5 percent of gross for their stalls he said 
growers first came to greenmarket with great skepticism 
benepe said they feared theyd come with full loads and go home 
with empty pockets ripoff city 
they found otherwise 
merrie kernan gets up at 230 am three days a week to drive a 
truckload of produce 125 miles from bridgton nj she likes 
talking with new yorkers even those who ask when banana season 
starts or will she have oranges or artichokes soon 
then there are the kids she brings lightning bugs for and the 
customer who just bought a small farm and told kernan she was going 
to pay someone to cut the hay i told her you dont pay 
somebody they pay you 
running a farm is very grueling and very demanding there are 
times you feel discouraged ryan said and the thing that 
really makes it worth it honestly its such a shot in the arm to 
get in that truck and go to market on saturday and know that its 
all worthwhile 
and for consumers studies show prices are 5 percent to 30 
percent lower at farmers markets where there are no middlemen 
and low transportation costs there is more than good shopping at 
work however 
without the markets many family farms too small to comply 
with demands for volume and uniformity of whole distributors 
would be forced to sell out a greenmarket survey found that 70 
percent of its farmers said the market was either essential or 
important to their economic wellbeing benepe said 
in connecticut the nonprofit hartford food system found that 
farmers could not afford to run fullscale markets in the poorest 
neighborhoods so it linked up with neighborhood organizations 
bought food from farmers and opened farmstands said mark winne 
the organizations executive director 
connecticut also is one of 10 states in the federal farmers 
market coupon program last year an estimated 275000 poor women 
and children were issued coupons worth 25 million many farmers 
also accept food stamps 
in massachusetts government made a difference schumacher said 
the mayors of many cities wanted to link consumers to local 
growers they gave us wonderful spots many in front of city halls 
boston brockton springfield 
the markets in turn can help a city 
a twiceweekly market saved downtown pasco wash said linda 
sue williams of the pasco downtown development association seventy 
farmers drive to a lot where the city has in the last five years 
built 48 shelters for growers and their food three thousand to 
5000 people shop there a week she said 
its been credited by many many people with saving the 
downtown williams said its the best thing thats happened to 
pasco in a long long time 
but a saturday market in columbus ohio across from a 
convention center under construction may be threatened by related 
commercial development 
there is support but our future is still a little unknown 
said nancy duncan porter executive director of the north market 
development authority which formed to save the market from 
becoming a parking lot just three years ago 
some people just like to tear down and build more than they 
like to preserve she said the market is a very people 
activity and social in nature and we think a great drawing card 
for downtown

state casino regulators on wednesday 
refused to let bondholders in the trump taj mahal casino resort 
participate in a hearing to determine the developers financial 
stability 
the casino control commission voted 32 against allowing 
bondholders from arguing orally at the oct 30 hearing however 
commissioners said the bondholders could petition to participate 
later when the agenda for the hearing becomes more certain 
the hearing will examine the financial stability of trumps 
three casinos and his ability to make a 473 million payment due 
nov 15 to taj mahal bondholders negotiations on the payments are 
continuing so the scope of the hearing could change 
the bondholders control 244 million or 363 percent of the 
675 million in notes used to finance the casino 
the commission ordered the hearing in august when it approved a 
65 million bank bailout to help trump make an overdue june 15 bond 
payment on the trump castle casino resort by the bay 
a state division of gaming enforcement report cast doubt on 
trumps ability to make the taj mahal payment in november and on 
his overall finances which are weighed down with 32 billion in 
debt 
martin greenberg the attorney for the petitioning bondholders 
told the commission the bondholders should be allowed to argue 
orally and in writing during the hearing 
it is safe to say there is concern with the apparent inability 
to make that payment greenberg told the commission we do not 
seek to delay we do not seek to make more difficult your function 
we do not seek to use this forum as a means of negotiating with 
the taj mahal 
but acting commission chairwoman valerie armstrong said the 
request was premature because the scope of the hearing has yet to 
be determined 
she also said she wanted to avoid setting a precedent that would 
allow groups to use the commission as a forum although she 
stressed the bondholders are not in that category 
letting anybody participate in hearings would be tantamount to 
birds flocking to an open landfill ms armstrong said

the stock market declined today nearly erasing 
the gains of the previous session as anxiety over the middle east 
prevailed 
prices opened mixed before the drift lower gathered momentum 
analysts said the market appeared to stabilize only because sellers 
moved to the sidelines not because buyers had surfaced to put a 
floor under prices 
stocks managed to inch up from their worst levels only in the 
last hour of trading 
in the energy pits the nearterm crude contract climbed back 
above 38 per barrel but alan ackerman senior vice president at 
gruntal financial inc cautioned that whats burdening the stock 
market is more complex than just rising oil prices weve had 
some relief in the upward pressure on energy prices but weve had 
no relief in the war talk 
indeed many analysts said the possibility of a military 
conflict with iraq has paralyzed the market inhibiting traders 
from holding stocks even overnight for fear war might break out and 
they would be left vulnerable 
further concerned about the economy and the budget deficit add 
an element of confusion to the market the lack of agreement on a 
budgetreduction plan coupled with todays announcement that 
durable goods orders fell 08 percent in august brings 
everything back into light that things are not that good said

sources of the anticancer drug doxorubicin after italian 
authorities seized the production facilities and inventory of a 
supplier 
but the biotechnology company already smarting from federal 
refusal to approve one of its own cancerfighting drugs said 
tuesdays seizure of sicor could be harmful 
unless sicor is able to overturn this decision it could 
have a significant effect on our generics business said cetus 
spokeswoman katharine russell 
doxorubicin is considered the most important product that cetus 
has sold through a joint venture with ben venue laboratories of 
bedford ohio the venture generated 33 million in sales for the 
fiscal year that ended june 30 
the seizure followed an investigation by the public prosecutor 
in milan into allegations of conspiracy and theft of trade secrets 
by sicor 
sicor also has been accused of stealing the strain that produces 
doxorubicin from farmitalia carlo erba srl an affiliate of 
erbamont nv of stamford conn erbamont sells doxorubicin in the 
united states under the trademark adriamycin 
the cetusben venue joint venture began selling doxorubicin last 
year after the original patent for adriamcin expired farmitalia 
had developed the drug in the early 1970s 
in july the food and drug administration refused to approve 
interleukin2 cetus anticancer drug the company also has been 
troubled by layoffs and a loss of 615 million for the past fiscal 
year

largest meat packers has stopped buying cattle for slaughter 
because of a possible furlough of federal meat inspectors 
other southwest kansas packers say they are concerned that 
failure by congress to approve a budget by sunday the deadline 
under the severe grammrudmanhollings deficit reduction measure 
might force furloughs of federal government employees including 
meat inspectors 
the food safety and inspection service and the us department 
of agriculture would have to lay off 7500 meat inspectors from 
oct 9 through 13 in effect that would shut down all meat and 
poultry slaughter and processing plants regulated by the agencies 
said jim greene a spokesman for the inspection service in 
washington 
obviously if you dont have federal inspectors you cant 
operate your plant said gene meakins vice president of public 
relations for monfort 
that could cause ripples throughout the industry such as a 
backlog of cattle at feed yards and higher consumer prices company 
officials say 
harry siegelman group vice president of cattle procurement for 
monfort said wednesday the company wont buy cattle for the week 
of oct 8 
we are planning on not killing that week the way it stands 
right now with inspection he said 
monfort based in greeley colo has a garden city plant that 
employs 1270 people 
dave bartel a spokesman for sen nancy kassebaum rkan said 
earlier this week that if a budget agreement isnt reached 
kassebaum has promised a continuing resolution to keep the present 
arrangement with meat inspectors until there is an agreement 
officials at ibp which owns a 2700employee plant near garden 
city said they were working through the american meat institute in 
arlington va to ensure a furlough doesnt happen 
were not aware of any slowdowns at this point said gary 
mickelson manager of communications 
he said it wasnt the first time the industry has faced the 
possibility of a budgetrelated furlough of inspectors but they 
were always averted before 
were hopeful this will be the case this time mickelson 
said 
rich parker director of information for the american meat 
institute in arlington va said members of congress have been 
told that furloughs could hurt the industry 
theres a possibility you could see a shutdown but we dont 
think it will happen he said 
five giant packing plants in southwest kansas including monfort 
and ibp employ more than 8200 people the state ranked first in 
the nation in 1989 for the number of cattle slaughtered at 62 
million head killed

a federal subpoena seeking the trading records of 
chicago mercantile exchange leader leo melamed and other officials 
is a publicity stunt the exchange said wednesday 
the records were requested by thomas a durkin a defense lawyer 
in a commodities fraud trial who contends that everyone at the merc 
from the top on down routinely ignored trading rules 
melamed is chairman of the exchanges executive committee and 
its bestknown official he has not been charged in the case 
durkin sent a subpoena last week to melameds trading firm 
dellsher investment co he sent another to the merc seeking more 
general trading records of exchange officials including the board 
of governors 
the defense attorneys subpoenas served on officers of the 
exchange can be characterized in the nature of a publicity stunt 
merc spokesman andrew yemma said 
the us attorneys office has repeatedly stated that neither 
the exchange nor its officers nor its member firms are in any way 
targets of the investigation 
yemma said melamed was unavailable for comment 
durkin is defending sam cali one of 14 japanese yen futures 
traders currently standing trial on federal charges including mail 
fraud and racketeering 
the charges stem from a federal probe of corruption at the merc 
and the chicago board of trade the worlds two largest commodities 
exchanges 
cali and the other defendants are accused of systematically 
cheating customers partly to avoid responsibility for mismatched 
buy and sell orders known as outtrades 
the subpoena served on dellsher requests documents relating to 
all outtrades price adjustments errors or customer 
complaints on yen futures contracts traded directly or indirectly 
by melamed 
it also asks for copies of any checks journals or ledgers 
reflecting the receipt of checks from floor brokers to settle 
trading discrencies 
durkin said in his opening statement that all traders routinely 
violated exchange rules to settle outtrades but that such 
violations did not constitute fraud or racketeering 
he said exchange officials were aware of such violations 
although the exchange has denied it

the publisher of two michigan 
newspapers has joined the ranks of those banning national tobacco 
advertisements a move a tobacco industry official predicted may 
come back to haunt them 
greenville news inc which owns the daily news and the carson 
city gazette a weekly as well as shopping guides announced its 
decision in an editorial last week in the daily news 
turning away easy dollars provided by agencygenerated tobacco 
advertising will be tough wrote john stafford publisher of the 
sixdayaweek 8500circulation newspaper but its necessary 
and responsible 
thirteen other newspapers nationwide do not accept tobacco 
advertising but these are the first in michigan according to the 
newspaper advertising bureau 
a spokesman for the tobacco institute which is funded by the 
tobacco industry said the publisher had made itself vulnerable to 
special interest groups offended by particular ads 
it is hard for a newspaper to talk about free speech and to 
rattle off bad restrictions for a common consumer product said 
thomas lauria assistant to the president of the washington 
dcbased group 
they are starting down a road that can lead to serious 
financial consequences and their selfimposed censorship of giving 
information to smokers may come back to haunt them he added 
larry carbonelli the newspapers general manager said the 
decision was made after an antidrug coloring book was inserted in 
the sept 13 edition 
it finally settled with us that its kind of hypocritical on 
our part telling kids not to use drugs and at the same time 
carrying tobacco ads he said 
he said the ban is aimed at ads placed by industry agencies and 
would not affect coupons advertising discounts on cigarettes by 
local stores 
tobacco ads account for about half of newspapers national 
advertising or roughly 3 percent of total advertising revenues 
according to advertising director john dallos he said the paper 
would find some way to make up the lost revenue without increasing 
its rates

the level of consumer confidence in the united 
states was unchanged in august but that left public sentiment on 
the economy at its lowest point since the 1982 recession the 
conference board said wednesday 
the business research organization said its consumer confidence 
index remained at 847 in september the index plunged 17 points to 
that level in august following the iraqi invasion of kuwait 
fabian linden a conference board economist said consumers 
remained uncertain as there was little progress in the persian gulf 
crisis 
people are increasingly concerned that inflation and interest 
rates will be rising linden added 
oil prices have surged since the middle east tensions erupted 
this has heightened consumer concerns about inflation and the 
economy and many have curtailed their plans to buy houses or cars 
in the last two months the conference board said 
a drop in consumer spending is itself a threat to the economy 
because consumer pending accounts for about twothirds of the 
gross national product 
the conference board is a businessfunded organization its 
monthly survey on consumer confidence is conducted by national 
family opinion inc of toledo ohio and questions 5000 households

newsweek and times mirror magazines are teaming 
up to offer advertisers package deals involving combinations of 
their magazines and affiliated newspapers television stations and 
cable tv systems 
the sponsors said the program was a first for separately owned 
consumer magazine publishers 
companies that publish several magazine titles such as time 
warner inc and hearst corp have frequently sold packages 
involving space in combinations of their own magazines newspapers 
or radio and tv stations 
but newsweek which is owned by washington post co and the 
times mirror inc subsidiary said their program is the first 
marketing package involving consumer magazines to be offered by 
companies independent of each other 
it is being called the newsweektime mirror advantage program 
media analysts and the programs supporters say it should help 
newsweek compete more effectively against the newsweeklies time and 
us news amp world report in the scramble for advertising revenue 
many advertising experts felt newsweek was placed at a 
disadvantage when time magazine co launched an incentive plan more 
than a year ago involving its magazines which includes time 
people sports illustrated life and fortune 
the advantage plan gives discounts to advertisers who meet 
certain minimum spending criteria in newsweek and at least four of 
the 10 times mirror titles and agree to boost their spending in 
those magazines by 20 percent 
the companies said the 11 magazines in the program have a 
combined circulation of 125 million led by 31 million for 
newsweek and can reach some key audiences 
for example they said the magazines reach 28 million men or 33 
percent of the adult men in the united states 
the times mirror titles in the program are field amp stream golf 
magazine home mechanix outdoor life popular science salt water 
sportsman ski magazine skiing the sporting news and yachting 
in addition to the discount plan the companies plan to publish 
special supplements that will appear in combinations of the 
magazines 
a supplement called travels for instance will be published 
next spring in golf ski yachting and the portion of newsweek that 
goes to business executives another supplement called your 
home will be published in the fall of 1991 with the full run of 
newsweek home mechanix and popular science 
the program will also enable advertisers to buy multimedia 
packages that could include combinations of magazines and 
newspapers owned by the parents of the magazines such as the 
washington post los angeles times newsday the baltimore sun and 
the hartford conn courant 
the multimedia packages could also include commercial time on 
the parent companies eight tv stations and their cable tv systems 
the companies will also offer to create programs for magazine 
advertisers that can include event sponsorship outdoor advertising 
and store displays 
peter eldredge publisher of newsweek said newsweek hopes to 
attrac more advertising from companies that deal in sporting 
goods insurance and home improvement that are heavy spenders in 
times mirror magazines 
at the same time he said times mirror may get more revenue from 
advertising categories represented heavily in newsweek such as 
automotive business equipment airline and liquor 
james kopper executive vice president at times mirror 
magazines said his company teamed up with newsweek because of the 
quality of the magazine and the long corporate relationship between 
their parent companies the washington post and los angeles times 
for instance have operated a news service since 1963 
he said in a telephone interview that he expects a 
considerable incremental benefit to result for both magazine 
operations as a result of the program 
the entire marketing community has been screaming for 
multimedia buys this is a strategic alliance that enables us to 
accomplish what the marketplace has been asking for he said

chase the nations second largest bank said friday it would 
cut its dividend in half this quarter reduce its payroll and

by poor loan quality sampp said

preferred stock and certificates of deposit issued by chase and 
some of its subsidiaries it affirmed its ratings of chase 
commercial paper 
the ratings agency said about 52 billion worth of debt and 
preferred stock is affected 
in a statement chase said it disagreed with sampps action 
particularly in light of sampps own comments citing chases strong 
base of retail banking profits the enhanced profits expected from 
our aggressive restructuring efforts as well as our liquidity and 
financial flexibility 
on tuesday moodys investors service the other major 
creditrating agency lowered its evaluation of chase debt by one

chrysler corp stock fell wednesday to a level 
unseen for years amid growing concern about losses the automaker 
will report for the third quarter 
its getting back to a price that it hasnt been at since 
1982 said auto analyst joseph phillippi of shearson lehman 
brothers inc in new york 
chrysler stock closed at 10 a share wednesday down 12 cents 
from tuesday it dipped below 10 briefly before struggling back on 
the new york stock exchange 
the last time chrysler stock closed at 10 a share was nov 12 
1982 its highest price after 3for2 splits in 1986 and 1987 was 
4525 in september 1987 
chryslers stock has been moving steadily down throughout the 
year but phillippi and other analysts said wednesday the company 
isnt facing nearly the same problems that it did in the late 1970s 
and early 1980s when it brushed with bankruptcy 
chryslers stock hit its low point at 3125 per share on dec 
23 1981 as it battled back toward profitability 
we would make a huge distinction between 79 and wherever this 
bottoms out said analyst douglas laughlin of bear stearns amp co 
of new york the balance sheet liquidity the product position 
and the competitiveness of the auto group is better overall 
the current decline apparently is being driven by increasing 
estimates of chryslers thirdquarter losses which could exceed 
200 million analysts said through the first half of the year 
chrysler earned 251 million down 64 percent from the same period 
last year 
the whole market is off and when the market gets sick people 
think chryslers sicker said company spokesman tom houston we 
havent made any bones about were not going to make any money in 
the third quarter 
the analysts said the decline has nothing to do with concern 
directly related to current national contract negotiations with the 
united auto workers union or rising oil and gasoline prices 
stemming from the mideast crisis 
chrysler has about 4 billion in cash and marketable securities 
on hand a good amount for the company they said 
chryslers car and truck sales have been on the skids the 
company reported tuesday that sales of its north americanmade cars 
and trucks which make up nearly all of chryslers sales were down 
15 percent from last year 
i think what youre looking at is a temporary gap in product 
thats affecting their selling raee laughlin said 
chrysler executives and analysts are awaiting the 1992 
introduction of a new midsize sedan codenamed the lh it will 
be the first allnew highvolume car designed by chrysler in years 
weve got enough money to get us to the time that we are 
going to have the lh on the street at least then and beyond 
houston said

during the period form 1984 through 1986 drexel was at the 
center of wall streets takeover boom clients came to drexel for 
the most part because of drexels unmatched ability to raise 
capital through the sale of highyield securities 
there is substantial evidence that milken caused drexel to 
buy and sell securities based upon material nonpublic information 
misappropriated from certain drexel clients in one of these 
instances milken traded on insider information for his own 
account 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
milkens submission dramatically exposes the gulf between his 
crimes and his conviction on the one hand and his continuing 
agitprop on the other milken has been convicted of serious and 
sweeping crimes his good works however commendable should not 
shield him from incarceration he should be sentenced to a 
substantial term of imprisonment 
milken is selling an old and threadbare story by focusing 
the courts attention on the five specific crimes he had admitted 
and by wholly ignoring his conviction on a broad conspiracy charge 
milken is attempting to minimize his criminal conduct were 
milken to address the true range of his crimes however even he 
would have to acknowledge a different conclusion milkens crimes 
were serious and extensive 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
milken has been convicted of enormously serious crimes 
conspiracy to violate the laws of the united states securities 
fraud mail fraud wire fraud tax fraud and recordkeeping and 
reporting violations 
although he has limited his allocution to five separate 
acts in furtherance of that conspiracy this court can and should 
sentence milken for all of his crimes 
in united states v kittel kittel a member of the 
new york chapter of the hells angels motorcycle club was charged 
with conspiracy to manufacture and distribute large quantities of 
methamphetamine and with 11 substantive counts relating to the 
unlawful distribution of methamphetamine he was convicted on his 
plea of guilty to the conspiracy charge and to one of the 
distribution charges in kittels sentencing however the 
government alleged that kittel had participated in the murder and 
dismemberment of another hells angels club member and the unlawful 
manufacture of an explosive device among other acts of violence 
judge pierre leval sentenced kittel to a 14year term of 
imprisonment stating that the sentence was based not only the 
particular offenses to which kittel had pleaded guilty but on the 
governments evidence of kittels unadmitted crimes persistent 
drug dealing and acts of violence 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
moreover although the government is asking the court to 
sentence milken on crimes more numerous than he has specifically 
admitted these additional charges are similar to the crimes that 
milken has admitted manipulating stocks unlawfully influencing 
corporate events through the concealed ownership of securities 
unlawfully providing benefits to clients and client representatives 
in order to cultivate their business and fraudulently 
misappropriating funds from clients 
indeed milkens agreement to pay 200 million in criminal 
penalities and 400 million in restitution dramatically belies both 
his contention that he committed only the five enumerated crimes 
and his argument that even these crimes were aberrational and 
technical violations these fines penalties and restitution fix 
the scope of milkens criminal conduct milkens agreement to pay 
these monies stands out as the most reliable measure of his 
criminal conduct 
for all these reasons this case is sharply different from 
united states v freeman in freeman where the judge refused 
to admit a sentencing report on additional crimes the defendant 
pleaded guilty to one narrow insider trading charge not to 
multiple offenses and a broad conspiracy charge unlike milken 
robert freeman did not acknowledge the governments right to put 
before the court his unadmitted offenses unlike milken 
freeman in his allocution did not admit that he committed crimes 
additional to the crimes to which he specifically pleaded guilty 
finally freeman did not agree to pay criminal fines and 
restitution penalties of 600 million

milken should be sentenced to a substantial period of 
incarceration commensurate with his crimes those crimes were 
pervasive and systemic they were committed for venal reasons to 
enhance milkens personal power and increase his wealth no good 
works undertaken by milken mitigate the imperative of a substantial 
prison term milkens proposal that he be sentenced to a 
probationary term and community service is absurd such a sentence 
would eviscerate law enforcements efforts to police and deter 
financial crime 
milkens crimes have had nationwide impact and his 
sentence will become the touchstone for every sentence for 
financial crime in the country 
other sentences demonstrate a consensus among judges that 
absent significant actual cooperation a major securities law 
violator such as milken will receive a substantial term of 
incarceration 
boeskys threeyear term of incarceration provides a useful 
point of departure as an initial symbolic matter milken stands 
convicted of six times as many felony charges as boesky and has 
agreed to pay six times boeskys criminal fine and civil penalty 
while the government does not suggest that simple arithmetic should 
determine milkens sentence milkens suggestion that facing 
almost six times boeskys penalty he merits a fraction of his 
punishment is preposterous 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
like boesky and levine milken committed very serious crimes 
unike boesky and levine however milken has not cooperated on the 
urging of the government boesky and levine each received reduced 
sentences because of their extraordinary assistance in the 
successful prosecutions of others 
boeskys cooperation resulted directly and indirectly in 
the successful prosecution of numerous prominent securities 
industry professionals in addition to milken in sharp contrast 
during the four years of boeskys cooperation milken has 
vigorously contested the governments charges and allowed the 
statute of limitations to preclude prosecution of others based on 
any information he could provide 
the sentence of paul bilzerian to four years in prison 
for repeated securities fraud crimes should also inform this 
courts exercise of its sentencing discretion bilzerians sentence 
was based on multiple criminal acts over an extended period of 
time his violations were similar in type to milkens admitted 
crimes though fewer in number milkens conduct is of course 
far more widespread and systemic than bilzerians 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
michael milken stands before this court having been convicted of 
six felonies carrying a maximum sentence of 28 years he has 
committed a range of serious whitecollar crimes unmatched in the 
1980s the government respectfully submits that this court should 
impose a sentence that reflects the full magnitude of milkens 
unlawful conduct and that unmistakably deters others the 
courts sentence must demonstrate that persons who possess great 
wealth and prominence cannot expect that their privilege or their 
money will insulate them from certain and serious punishment 
for these reasons the government respectfully urges that 
michael milken be sentenced to a substantial term of imprisonment

irans top financial official on wednesday 
asked nations with huge oil stockpiles to help restore stability to 
oil markets by tapping their strategic reserves 
the white house announced later that president bush would do 
just that offering 5 million barrels from the 590million barrel 
reserve stored in salt domes along the texas and louisiana coasts 
but bush was not acting in response to the iranian request 
industrial countries should use their current reserves to 
relieve the current pressure on the international oil market and to 
restore stability said mohsen nourbakhsh iranian minister of 
economic affairs and finance 
the united states japan and european countries have reserves of 
crude oil set up after the oil crisis of the 1970s to provide a 
cushion against shortages 
some members of congress have called for a release of some us 
reserves to help bring down the price of crude oil which has been 
moving up toward 40 a barrel 
as far as were concerned a stable international oil market 
will be beneficial for both the oil producers and the consumers 
nourbakhsh told the annual meeting of the international monetary 
fund and the world bank 
he said the crisis is bringing many oilproducing countries 
including iran additional expenses for defense and for resettling 
refugees from iraq and kuwait 
nourbakhsh said the cost of imports from industrial countries 
has risen resulting in erosion of any increase in the oil export 
earnings of oil producers and fueling global inflation

president bushs decision to tap into the 
nations strategic crude oil reserve will probably put the brakes 
on the rapid rise in oil prices at least in the short run experts 
said wednesday night 
we should be considerably lower said ed kevelson a dean 
witter reynolds inc trader who deals in oil futures on the new 
york mercantile exchange youve certainly got that possibility 
for a big move to the downside 
the presidents announcement on wednesday night was made after 
the market closed to finish off a day in which wild rumors pushed 
crude oil futures to a recordhigh settlement price of 3867 per 
barrel 
kevelson said that when the exchange opens on thursday morning 
speculators will probably take a cue from the way overseas oil 
markets respond 
id be interested to see how london reacts off this 
kevelson said 
the white house said the government would take 5 million barrels 
of crude out of the us strategic petroleum reserve which 
contains nearly 600 million barrels of oil stored in salt caverns 
in texas and louisiana in announcing the decision spokesman 
marlin fitzwater said there has been no justification for the 
recent runup in oil and gasoline prices 
since iraq invaded kuwait on aug 2 crude oil prices have 
almost doubled from around 20 per barrel to nearly 40 
oil has shot up amid war jitters on the trading floor even 
though supplies have remained at adequate levels the cash price 
that is paid by oil companies is closely related to the futures 
price that is paid by speculators who gamble on future supply and 
demand but rarely take possession of any oil 
bushs move drew criticism from those who point out that the 
strategic reserve was put in place following the oil shocks of the 
early 1970s as a mechanism to fight oil shortages but not high 
prices 
i think the administration may be trying to curb the 
speculation of people in the mercantile exchange who keep bidding 
up the price which is having an effect on inflation said 
professor james m patterson of the indiana university school of 
business this is really an economic move rather than an 
energypolicy move 
patterson said i think this is strictly a political response 
i think its inappropriate but it may also serve as a test for the 
workability of the reserve 
the reserve has never been used apart from a 1million barrel 
test sale in 1985 that was not aimed at influencing prices oil 
from the reserve is auctioned by the energy department and picked 
up by the bidders who are selected 
a potential problem of the reserve is its quantities of sour 
crude which contains high sulfur content that makes the oil 
unusable in many us refineries

a law professor testified wednesday that neil bush 
adequately informed fellow silverado savings and loan directors of 
his dealings with a developer who got a 900000 line of credit 
from the thrift 
a federal office of thrift supervision official however 
implied in testimony at an administrative hearing that president 
bushs son could have been more forthright with the silverado board 
about his relationship with denver developer kenneth good 
and another law professor said bushs actions as a silverado 
board member were unsafe unethical and unreasonable 
geoffrey c hazard jr a yale law professor summoned as an 
expert witness by bushs lawyer said bush a silverado director 
from 1985 to 1988 gave the board enough information 
he said bush told the board he had business dealings with good 
before the board approved the line of credit for good international 
inc a partnership formed by bush and good bush abstained from 
voting on the line of credit which he and good never used 
the office of thrift supervision has alleged that bush as a 
silverado director improperly voted on loans and credit for good 
and bill walters another denver developer who invested in bushs 
oil and gas exploration company 
good and walters eventually defaulted on more than 132 million 
in loans from the thrift silverado collapsed in late 1988 at a 
cost to taxpayers of 1 billion 
the hearing which could lead to bush being banned from the 
banking and savings industry began tuesday 
bush 35 has not yet attended the hearing he is scheduled to 
be the last witness to testify probably thursday his lawyer 
james nesland said bush wouldnt invoke his fifth amendment right 
against selfincrimination 
he will testify and he will answer all the questions he is 
asked nesland said 
on tuesday former silverado chairman michael wise the 
hearings leadoff witness invoked the fifth amendment 14 times 
when questioned in the judges chambers about his knowledge of 
bushs business dealings 
appearing with bush will be another former silverado director 
denver car dealer florian barth who refused to testify tuesday 
but changed his mind attorneys said wednesday 
government counsel stephen hershkowitz told administrative law 
judge daniel j davidson that barth had decided to appear before 
the hearing thursday morning davidson had threatened to subpoena 
barth 
hazard testified he was unsure how much bush actually told the 
board about the relationship but it was sufficient that he told 
them he was in business with mr good 
hazard said he believed directors need to consider state laws 
and legal opinions to gain insight into what their responsibilities 
are 
but terry sandefur the ots assistant deputy district director 
of supervision in topeka kan said tuesday he was not as certain 
as hazard that the disclosure was adequate he implied that bush 
may not have told the board all that he could have 
nesland pressed sandefur on the issue he said silverados 
investment committee and the board itself with bush abstaining 
approved the line of credit unanimously 
no doubt at the board meeting the transaction was found to 
be in the best interests of silverado bushs lawyer said 
maybe they perceived it to be in the best interests of 
silverado sandefur said emphasizing perceived 
edward g conry a law professor at the university of colorado 
and a witness for the office of thrift supervision said bushs 
actions were unsafe unethical and unreasonable 
his capacity to exercise impartial judgment was diminished 
because of his relationship with mr walters conry said he said 
bush put his selfinterest above silverados 
nesland irritated asked conry are you a mindreader 
i can see a vivid conflict of interest as well as anyone else 
can conry said 
on tuesday russell murray a former silverado executive vice 
president discussed his review of the 900000 line of credit for 
good international he testified he did not recall anyone 
questioning it even though good and bush had a business 
relationship 
he said he discussed the request with bush good and silverado 
chairman michael wise and then wrote a memo to the thrifts 
directors about the relationship before they approved the line of 
credit 
but he said that he did not have all the details of the 
relationship and that he would have asked for a legal opinion if he 
had had all the facts 
after the hearing davidson and ots officials will examine the 
testimony and then recommend whether any action should be taken 
against bush 
last week the federal deposit insurance corp sued bush and 
other former silverado directors for 200 million the lawsuit 
which also named wise and barth alleged gross negligence on the 
part of silverado directors contributed to the sampls collapse

lockheed corp fired three auditors because 
they blew the whistle on dangerously flawed metal used in the c5b 
cargo plane their lawyer said wednesday as trial of their wrongful 
dismissal suit began 
the lawsuit being heard in state court here contends they were 
fired in 1985 for questioning the structural integrity of the 
bodies of the c5b the biggest plane in the western world 
the suit seeks unspecified damages 
lockheed says the men were let go for unprofessional conduct and 
violating company policies but in his opening statement wednesday 
attorney herbert hafif accused the big military contractor of 
lying 
the men were fired after they wrote letters to lockheeds second 
highestranking official demanding grounding of c5bs while 
additional tests were conducted hafif told jurors 
the first letter was the hottest potato ever handed down in 
this industry hafif said after a letter like that youve 
kissed a promotion goodbye 
hafif contends that even though no provable accidents have 
occurred because of the deficiencies the c5b is very dangerous 
the plane which can carry 145 tons of cargo is being used heavily 
in the persian gulf 
lockheed acknowledges that problems emerged in 1983 early on in 
the c5b program with forged metal mainframe parts that were 
heattreated 
the company maintains that it and the air force fixed the 
problems and have studied the possibility of mainframe deficiencies 
over the years they have determined that parts were properly 
prepared and are safe lockheed said in a statement 
the auditors say they took their concerns all the way up the 
chain of command to lockheeds president at the time lawrence o 
kitchen 
lockheed says one employee clyde jones jr had already retired 
before kitchen learned of the matter it maintains the others 
thomas benecke and terrence schielke were dismissed for 
circumventing company policies and audit procedures 
simply put they totally failed to perform their jobs in a 
professional manner lockheed said in a written statement of its 
side of the case 
in an august 1985 letter to kitchen the auditors said our 
patience is exhausted 
we will not be delayed or stonewalled for any reason this 
issue deals with life and death and this letter represents our 
last resort in dealing with this problem internally 
lockheed says the employees waited 22 months before suddenly 
demanding that the c5bs be grounded in a deposition kitchen said 
he told the employees he didnt like their approach 
i asked why they had not followed the procedure of an audit 
report and taken it through the proper process why they hadnt 
carried out their responsibilities that they had as auditors and 
that i didnt appreciate them coming in at the last hour he 
said 
lockheed also said that it has proved sample materials taken by 
the workers were not from production mainframe parts and 
additional tests of the materials themselves proved that they were 
not defective as claimed

president bush arguing there is no 
justification for speculation that has driven up the price of oil 
and gasoline said wednesday he would sell 5 million barrels of 
crude oil from the strategic petroleum reserve 
the white house said the bush decision would send a signal 
to those who would take advantage of the persian gulf crisis to 
profit from skyrocketing oil prices 
tapping the reserve a move urged by industry analysts and some 
members of congress since iraqs aug 2 invasion of kuwait was 
aimed at driving down the price of crude on world markets 
the president is turning to the 590million barrel reserve to 
stabilize the oil market for the first time since it was created in 
1975 oil was briefly pumped from the reserve in 1985 to test the 
physical and bureaucratic systems for moving it 
the price of crude oil has edged toward 40 a barrel this week 
nearly twice the level when iraqs occupation of kuwait touched off 
the current oil crisis 
ed kevelson a dean witter reynolds inc trader who deals in oil 
futures on the new york mercantile exchange said the sellng of 
reserve oil could have a quick effect we should be considerably 
lower he said youve certainly got that possibility for a big 
move to the downside 
announcing his action at a republican fundraiser bush said 
its especially important that america is economically healthy 
and militarily strong 
at home and abroad let me caution those who might take 
advantage of the current crisis in the persian gulf those who 
might seek profit by subverting the sanctions or here at home 
those speculators who might try to drive up the price of oil 
the president said that even though the oil market is very 
tight with little spare capacity there is sufficient oil to meet 
current needs 
bush said that oil markets had not taken into account additional 
production from saudi arabia and other sources nor the availability 
of existing stocks 
congress authorized the 5millionbarrel test sale two weeks 
ago over the administrations opposition in a bill extending 
bushs authority to tap the reserve that authority would have 
expired sept 15 had he not signed the bill that day 
weve been suggesting this to him said rep john dingell 
dmich chairman of the house energy and commerce committee who 
called bushs action a good first step 
but dingell said the administration needs to follow it up by 
calling on west germany and japan possibly at a meeting friday of 
the 21nation international energy agency in paris to also tap 
stockpiles 
senate republican leader bob dole who more than a month ago 
called on bush to tap the reserve also welcomed bushs decision 
the taxpayers have been paying for the oil reserve for years 
and they have every right to expect that it be put to good use in 
the face of an energy crunch 
the 14year buildup of the reserve has cost an estimated 20 
billion 
industry experts have estimated that production in other 
countries has restored about twothirds of the 48 million daily 
barrels of oil production removed from world markets by iraqs 
takeover of kuwait and the world embargo against iraqikuwaiti oil 
there is no justification for the intensive and unwarranted 
speculation in oil futures bush said 
as recently as a week ago bush who spent nearly 20 years 
exploring for and producing oil in texas before entering politics 
voiced hesitation about resorting to the reserves saying such an 
action could stabilize the market but would not be justified in 
terms of an oil shortage 
this is a decision that the president came to reluctantly 
white house spokesman marlin fitzwater said he said bush reached 
the decision only hours earlier in chicago after consulting with 
energy secretary james watkins 
another official said opinion in the administration had been 
divided over whether to tap the reserve but in recent days people 
were coming around to the view that it should be done 
fitzwater said there was no evidence that the oil industry was 
involved in price gouging but its our judgment that price rises 
of this nature could not be entirely based on legitimate market 
forces 
fitzwater said the decision to put 5 million barrels on the 
market was a test and the president would take additional steps 
to stabilize energy prices if he believed they were needed 
the oil is stored in a system of saltdome caverns in louisiana 
and texas and represents a 73day supply of imports 
the united states uses more than 17 million barrels a day 
it should take about 15 or 16 days for the energy department to 
award contracts after asking for bids and 30 to 60 days to deliver 
the oil the white house said 
the reserves are accessible through the vast oil pipeline 
network in texas and louisiana 
professor james m patterson of the indiana university school of 
business said this is really an economic move rather than an 
energypolicy move 
i think this is strictly a political response i think its 
inappropriate but it may also serve as a test for the workability 
of the reserve he said

industrial co

and its board of directors from limiting talks to the japanese 
firm a leader in the production of stereos televisions and tape 
players

cineplex odeon 
schulman said more than 73 million shares of mca stock have been 
issued and public stockholders number in the thousands although 
he could not provide an exact figure 
both matsushita and mca have remained tightlipped about the 
talks matsushita has said only that mca is one of several 
companies with which it is talking mca confirmed in a prepared 
statement that it is in discussions with a major international 
company regarding a possible acquisition but would say no more
