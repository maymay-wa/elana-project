queen elizabeth paid homage to spanish war 
dead addressed parliament and accepted the keys to the capital 
tuesday during a busy second day of her visit to spain the first 
ever by a reigning british monarch 
the queen in spain on a fiveday visit told a joint session of 
parliament that britain and spain would play important roles in the 
future development of europe she praised spain for 10 years of 
democracy following nearly four decades under the authoritarian 
regime of gen francisco franco 
in her speech which received a standing ovation elizabeth did 
not mention the british colony of gibraltar the only major 
political dispute between the two countries 
on monday night both the british monarch and her third cousin 
and spanish host king juan carlos said they believed the two 
countries would eventually resolve their differences over the 
colony that guards the atlantic entrance to the mediterranean sea 
spain seeks sovereignty over gibraltar which it ceded to 
britain by treaty in 1713 after losing the war of spanish 
succession britain has said gibraltar will remain british unless 
its 30000 inhabitants decide otherwise 
earlier tuesday a small but enthusiastic crowd waving british 
and spanish flags applauded as the queen and her husband the duke 
of edinburgh placed a laurel wreath at a memorial to those who 
gave their lives for spain 
elizabeth then went to city hall to accept the keys to madrid 
from mayor juan barranco 
the visit brought normally heavy traffic in madrid to a 
standstill as police blocked off streets along the motorcades 
route 
the queens visit is to include trips to barcelona seville and 
el escorial a palace built in the foothills of the guadarrama 
mountains north of madrid by king phillip ii 
the royal couple were also to spend two days on a private visit 
with juan carlos and sofia on the mediterranean island of majorca

newspapers must fight attempts by presidential 
campaigns to orchestrate the news in hopes of getting good 
television coverage says the president of the associated press 
managing editors association 
the most important journalism in this campaign is being 
delivered by the reporters who are going in after the candidates 
have been there and are talking to voters about impressions of the 
candidates and about the real problems of their regions robert 
h giles vice president and executive editor of the detroit news 
told the apme on tuesday the first day of its annual convention 
he told the newspaper editors my premise is that newspaper 
editors are allowing television news directors and the campaign 
strategists for george bush and michael dukakis to influence their 
page 1 agendas 
as a result he added we are the targets of criticism 
about biased or frivolous coverage that is more appropriately the 
fault of television 
giles suggested newspapers rely on wire services for much of the 
daytoday campaign coverage and concentrate on providing readers 
with issues stories 
on the wide perception that the current campaign has been 
especially negative walter r mears ap vice president and 
executive editor said contests in the 1960s such as the 
goldwaterjohnson race in 1964 were no less strident or less 
shaped by imagemakers 
we meaning the people who report the campaign have been 
telling the voters this is a campaign of sound bites crafted by 
handlers and interpreted by spincontrol specialists he said 
those buzzwords make it sound as though these were all 1988 
creations i dont think theres anything unique about it 
more than 600 editors from around the country are attending the 
weeklong annual convention the ap the largest newsgathering 
organization in the world serves 1467 daily newspapers 
in his address to the editors ap president and general manager 
louis d boccardi said the wire service is in the midst of its most 
extensive modernization in its photography financial and technical 
delivery services 
as our periodic announcements may have suggested to you we 
are in the midst of the most thorough and concentrated rebuilding 
and modernizing of ap services that has been attempted in modern 
times boccardi said 
editors also heard presentations from ap editors on developments 
in news and photography distribution and discussions of changes in 
the soviet union and its press 
stanislav menshikov a soviet economist who collaborated with 
harvard economist john kenneth galbraith on a book about the united 
states and the soviet union told the editors that economic change 
is meeting some resistance from the soviet bureaucracy 
they still control most of the economy and make economic 
change a fiction and not a fact menshikov said 
galbraith said us fears of communism and soviet fears of 
capitalism have abated in recent years we live in a time when 
both of those fears have evaporated except on the paranoiac 
right he said 
at a session on the soviet press alexander shalnev new york 
correspondent for izvestia said soviet newspapers reacted to 
greater press freedom with more negative stories about their 
country and more positive ones on america 
he cited an upsurge in the inclination to write as many 
negative things as we could find out and said the boundaries on 
what is acceptable still are being defined 
at a panel discussion on new england david nyhan political 
columnist for the boston globe advised the visiting editors to 
watch where you walk and how you drive 
driving is the most dangerous thing you can do in 
massachusetts even more than taking advice from harvard he said 
judson hale editor of yankee magazine said new englands 
greatest export is its conscience the new england conscience 
never kept anyone from doing anything but it does keep you from 
enjoying it he said

democrat michael dukakis lashed at frontrunning george bush as 
a man with no convictions no ideas and no plans tuesday and 
blamed republican policies for last years stock market plunge 
bush tried to contain supporters enthusiasm over polls showing him 
building a large lead 
were not going to lighten up the republican presidential 
nominee said while campaigning in missouri no votes can be taken 
for granted and im not taking any votes for granted i will 
continue to campaign as an underdog 
there was no question who was the real underdog dukakis but 
he drew enthusiastic crowds as he campaigned through michigan with 
aides battling the growing perception that bush had taken an 
insurmountable lead with just three weeks until the election 
dukakis running mate lloyd bentsen delivered a strongly worded 
response to the republicans accusing bush of running one of the 
most outrageous displays of negative campaigning ever seen in the 
history of national politics 
the massachusetts governor sharpened his language as he focused 
on economic issues and portrayed bush as the candidate of the 
wealthy 
george bush cares about he people on easy street dukakis 
said i care about the people on main street hes on their side 
im on your side 
duke duke duke chanted the crowds 
dukakis also brought up the huge stockmarket drop that occurred 
one year ago wednesday 
the trade deficit had soared he said republican policies 
of borrow and spend and borrow and spend had done the damage 
he pledged to eliminate the 150 billion trade deficit in four 
years by reducing the budget deficit increasing foreign trade 
investing in education and putting more emphasis on research he 
said bush wouldnt talk about his plans 
hes got the flags and balloons but no convictions no ideas 
and no plans dukakis said 
the democrats aides disputed an nbcwall street journal poll 
showing bush with a 17point lead his largest of the campaign 
they pointed instead to other polls indicating about half that 
margin 
bush trying to avoid overconfidence campaigned in fulton mo 
and invoked the memory of winston churchill at the westminster 
college where churchill delivered his 1946 iron curtain speech 
warning of soviet expansionism in eastern europe 
bush said the demarcation between east and west is now a 
rusting curtain he said that if elected he would be wary of 
soviet intentions despite what he called more enlightened 
leadership under mikhail gorbachev 
now is not the time to abandon realism about what moves the 
soviet union bush said 
the bush campaign began airing tough new television commercials 
that ridicule dukakis and say he has opposed virtually every 
defense system we developed 
the ad uses videotape of the helmeted dukakis in the turret of 
an m1 tank a ride the democrat took in september in an attempt to 
show toughness on defense issues but which critics said made him 
look silly 
dukakis spokeswoman lorraine voles called the ad more 
distortions from the bush campaign 
the dukakis campaign dispatched dozens of workers from his 
national headquarters in boston into the field along with more 
than 1300 new volunteers from washington the campaign said 60 
percent of the headquarters staff was being assigned to campaign 
duties in target states 
among the other volunteers are students congressional aides and 
washington attorneys taking leaves for the final three weeks of the 
campaign 
the washington post reported wednesday without attribution that 
in addition the dukakis campaign has requested time from abc cbs 
and nbc for five 30minute programs and hopes to air the shows at 
the same time on each network the newspaper said the plan would 
cost about 5 million 
public polls ranged from bad to worse for dukakis though his 
aides pointed to what they said was a new harris poll putting the 
gap at 9 points barbara winokur a spokeswoman for louis harris amp 
associates said harris would release a poll wednesday but declined 
to comment on its results in advance 
two other surveys found bush leads of about that size one of 
1002 registered voters polled saturday through monday put the 
race at 4939 another of 1201 likely voters friday through 
monday put it at 4940 
both were ongoing tracking polls in which the newest days 
result is added to several days being covered and the oldest days 
is dropped done by krccommunications research in cambridge 
mass they had threepoint error margins 
republican vice presidential candidate dan quayle traveled by 
bus caravan through small illinois towns accompanied by gov james 
thompson quayle said he felt a special obligation to help 
george bush define the needs of a new generation of americans 
their challenges their responses 
with george bush you get experience the 41yearold quayle 
said with me you get the future the future of america 
bentsen in los angeles denounced bushs campaign attacks on 
dukakis as an utterly vicious onslaught of distortion and 
character assassination he said the democrats have been a 
little too flabbergasted sometimes to make a proper response 
they dont seem to mind if what they say is untrue he said 
they dont seem to worry if its misleading they dont seem to 
care that what they do is downright mean if it sounds good say 
it if it sells package it if it looks good nominate it 
democrat jesse jackson discounted suggestions he has not worked 
hard enough for dukakis his former rival for the democratic 
nominamtion 
no democrat since atlanta has traveled more miles spoken to 
more people and registered more democrats for the ticket than i 
have the democratic runnerup said in a telephone interview from 
his chicago home

a gunman robbed a bank tuesday kidnapped 
the bank manager and drove off in the managers car only to be 
cornered by a police roadblock on an interstate authorities said

police closed interstate 176 a spur from interstate 76 leading to 
reading said terrell weaver a police communications operator 
negotiations with the gunmman continued late tuesday mrs 
weaver said 
a state police swat team and an fbi tactical team arrived at the 
scene six hours after the standoff began about 10 miles south of 
this southeast pennsylvania city said a berks county dispatch 
supervisor who declined to give her name 
a nearby access road was closed because traffic seemed to 
startle the gunman the supervisor said 
the suspects brother was brought to the scene in an effort to 
persuade him to surrender but the robber asked his brother to 
leave said the supervisor

officer but he turned the offer down authorities said

steven levys book is about a hippielike new 
age guru who allegedly killed his girlfriend and stuffed her in a 
trunk teresa carpenters book is about a professor who battered 
his prostitutemistress 
when this husband and wife dine at night does mayhem mingle 
with the meatloaf not necessarily they say 
it would be wrong to suggest our conversations were 
excessively morbid they dont tend to be morose says levy 
but carpenter quickly adds we could swap forensic stories and 
i could tell him who he should talk to in the fbi 
for three years levy 37 and carpenter 40 worked separately 
but simultaneously on these two accounts of similarly repulsive 
crimes 
the experience of both writing at the same time turned out quite 
well carpenter said during a recent interview at the couples 
fifth avenue apartment a welllighted bookfilled home 
in his book the unicorns secret murder in the age of 
aquarius to be published this month by prentice hall press 
levy examined the bizarre case of ira einhorn philadelphias 
enigmatic peaceandlove freak and parapsychology crusader who was 
charged in 1979 with killing his girlfriend holly maddux eighteen 
months after maddux was last seen alive her decomposed mummified 
body was found in a locked trunk in their apartment 
einhorn known about town as the unicorn shrugged off the 
allegations and accused the cia and others of planting evidence in 
his home but he skipped bail before trial he remains a fugitive 
likely living in europe 
carpenters book missing beauty published in june by ww 
norton is the story of what led tufts university medical 
researcher william douglas in 1983 to smash the skull of robin 
benedict the highpriced boston prostitute with whom hed fallen 
insanely in love 
even though the essentials of the stories are similar both 
victims were women trying to extract themselves from relationships 
with obsessively possessive men the two men could not be more 
unalike 
the unicorn was a brilliant and charismatic bear of a figure a 
ladies man extraordinaire and counterculture oddball given to such 
benign weirdness as answering his door stark naked though he 
dressed in a dashiki and dirty jeans sported a full beard and 
shoulderlength hair and frequently smelled bad einhorn 
established an incredible global network of scientists corporate 
sponsors and wealthy benefactors 
ira was the epitome of the guy who worked in fringe circles 
was antiestablishment and still looked like a hippie when he was 
almost 40 says levy douglas was this traditional respected 
man 
superficially douglas did appear to lead a normal life he was 
a solidly middleclass family man with three children an eminent 
medical school professor and acknowledged expert in cell culture 
everything about him was so normal so stultifyingly normal 
he was a man who one would never imagine could have gotten 
himself into a situation like this carpenter said 
but then there was that other side sufficiently dark private 
and perverse to fascinate the pulitzer prizewinning reporter for 
four years carpenter received the award in 1981 for her crime 
coverage for the village voice 
here was a scientist who had been embezzling research funds to 
support a mistress who happened to be a hooker he was living a 
double life thats what hooked me she said 
researching her book carpenter spent weeks walking the streets 
and hanging out in the bars and strip joints of the combat zone 
the netherworld that is bostons redlight district talking to 
bartenders pimps whores and strippers who knew douglas young 
victim 
that was very difficult for me im not a street person and 
never dared pose as one she said 
while carpenter was exploring the gamy depths levy was having 
anxieties of his own as he waited for her nightly call from boston 
assuring him that she was safe 
i wasnt happy about it but this is what teresa does its 
important for her to do the story right levy said 
missing beauty is carpenters first book but she was 
already a respected master of crime stories she had reported on 
the killings of playmate dorothy stratton and politician allard 
lowenstein 
the unicorns secret is levys first major excursion into 
the genre his other book hackers is about the personal 
computer revolution levy is a freelance writer and contributing 
editor for rolling stone 
so what is the allure of the macabre 
says levy when something happens it gives you a window into 
the way people live the way people are its like an 
archaeological dig like if someone unearths a civilization frozen 
by a volcano or something thats what a murder does it freezes 
details of our lives

ship and its cargo of 5400 japanese cars to the bottom of the 
atlantic whatever the outrage of ecologists because no 
practical alternative is available 
that was the comment of adm silva horta chairman of the 
portuguese national council against marine pollution after 
returning last week from london where he reported on the case to 
the convention on the prevention of marine pollution by dumping 
the 58000ton reijin ran aground april 27 in shallow water off 
the northern city of oporto the first stop on its maiden voyage 
from japan to ireland one sailor was killed 
emerald shipholding sa a japaneseowned panamanian company to 
which the ship belongs said july 13 the reijin was not recoverable 
and assumed responsibility for the wrecks removal the new cars 
must be scuttled because they could be unsafe to drive 
horta said the company insisted on sinking the ship and its 
100million cargo at sea and threatened to abandon the wreck if 
portugal refused to cooperate that would leave the portuguese with 
disposal project costing millions of dollars 
environmentalists in portugal and elsewhere say the 173 tons of 
copper and lead 115 tons of paint 28 tons of oil and more than 
1000 tons of rubber plastic and textiles could seriously damage 
marine life 
salvage workers are dismantling the reijins top decks and 
ferrying the scrap metal and some cars ashore the rest of the ship 
will be refloated towed out and sunk in at least 6000 feet of 
water horta said in an interview 
cars now being unloaded will be dumped 40 miles off the coast 
and the wreck with the remaining cargo will be scuttled 150 miles 
out by midnovember the admiral said 
the robin wood association an ecology group based in paris has 
called the decision an ecological crime and further criticism 
has come from the oslo convention which monitors sea pollution 
portuguese environmentalists want action from the european 
economic community of which portugal has been a member since jan 
1 1986 
it is indeed a crime dangerous to the whole world not just 
to portugal mike weber a german lecturer at oportos institute 
for biomedical science said in a telephone interview any 
ecology schoolbook will tell you that one liter of oil pollutes one 
million liters of water 
marine authorities feel they have no choice 
if the government tried to salvage the wreck it not only would 
have to pay the estimated cost of 15 million but might also face 
claims from japanese automakers contending that their images were 
tarnished by the sale of potentially unsafe cars to bargainhunters 
we could not take over the task of removing the ship ourselves 
because we did not have the technical financial or even legal 
means to do so before the autumn bad weather horta said 
coast guard officials say the first storm of the winter season 
probably would destroy the grounded vessel and spread the wreckage 
in portuguese coastal waters so the admiral said we consider 
the plan to dump at sea the lesser evil 
removal of another ship the tollan grounded in the tagus 
estuary off lisbon in 1980 cost the government more than 14 
million and officials want to avoid a far larger bill for the 
reijin 
owners are required by portuguese law to remove wrecks declared 
to be dangerous but horta said it is unfortunately wellknown 
that this obligation very often cannot be enforced 
shipping companies that operate under the panamanian flag of 
convenience often have little capital other than their vessels 
horta said the reijin apparently was the only valuable asset of 
emerald shipholding 
insurers are reluctant to talk about the case but one based in 
lisbon speaking privately said he was mystified that such a 
modern wellequipped ship could sink in shallow waters after 
making a long tough voyage from japan 
one theory is that the computerized selfleveling system 
overreacted when about 200 cars were unloaded in oporto and the 
crew was unable to adjust it

new outbreaks of racial insults were 
reported at smith college and the university of massachusetts as 
the second anniversary neared of a postworld series brawl at the 
state school that injured 10 people 
at smith college in nearby northampton president mary maples 
dunn sent a memo to the schools 2722 undergraduates last week 
saying that notes with racial slurs had been slipped under a 
students door and tacked onto a bulletin board 
a separate memo from the office of student affairs said other 
students had received four similar notes since midseptember the 
school said an investigation was under way 
a university of massachusetts administrator said he was looking 
into reports of racial slurs made over walkietalkies two weeks 
ago on a frequency reserved for foremen and supervisors of the 
physical plant department on the amherst campus of 26650 students 
ive been working as dispatcher here 13 years and ive never 
heard anything like that said dennis hmieleski the radio 
dispatcher on duty at the time you hear people joking around 
sometimes and you take it for that but it was the tone of the 
voice you could tell it was no joke 
hmieleski said he wasnt certain who made the remarks he said 
he and other workers reported them to their departments director 
who said he expects to make his findings public later this week 
there have been recent racial incidents at other schools in the 
nation 
six depauw university fraternities and sororities apologized for 
a ghetto party with decorations that included graffiti slurs 
against black and other minorities 
members of the six organizations at the greencastle ind 
campus staged a candlelight vigil monday night and marched from the 
alpha tau omega house where the party was held friday night to 
the association for afroamerican students office members of the 
two groups conferred shook hands and embraced 
at stanford university officials promised to look into two 
racist incidents in recent weeks last friday a poster at the 
predominantly black fraternity house ujamaa was discovered 
emblazoned with the word niggers 
two weeks earlier a flier depicting beethoven as brownskinned 
with wild curly hair big lips and red eyes was left outside the 
room of a black freshman from chicago 
the reports of incidents at the western massachusetts schools 
came as the university of massachusetts prepared for a weeklong 
commemoration of a fight between white boston red sox fans and 
black new york mets fans after the mets won the final game of the 
world series on oct 27 1986 
soon after the fight racial epithets were found spraypainted 
on steps at smith a year later two black administrators and the 
first black woman to earn tenure at smith resigned from their 
posts saying the school had shut minorities out of decision making 
another fight between blacks and whites at the university of 
massachusetts last february sparked a sixday building takeover by 
more than 100 minority students protesting racial violence and what 
they said was a low minority enrollment at least 8 percent of 
undergraduates at the school last year were minorities 
the six students accused of fighting last winter are scheduled 
to appear in hampshire district court in northampton for a hearing 
oct 27 
to mark the anniversary the university plans a week of 
racismawareness events beginning friday they include hands 
across umass a chain of students linking hands around the 
campus and a lecture by civil rights activist and atlanta mayor 
andrew young 
smith unveiled its plan to combat racism in a report released 
last week that among other things calls for a 20 percent minority 
faculty by mid1999 and gives the college until 1995 to admit a 
firstyear class with the same percentage of minority students as 
the population of high school graduates 
smith spokeswoman debra bradley said 19 percent of this years 
freshman class and 135 percent of the total student population are 
minorities 
a committee of smith faculty trustees administrators and 
students came up with the plan after 200 students marched on the 
presidents house in april with a list of grievances including 
demands to be included in the hiring of an affirmative action 
officer 
its a good plan especially when one considers its coming in 
to fill a complete vacuum said wambui mwangi president of the 
smith african student association

is the amendment in purgatory only the 
category will tell 
the senate struggling to deal with hundreds of amendments to a 
bill providing new ammunition for the war on drugs hammered 
together a system designed to speed its work and permit congress to 
adjourn for the year 
at times it appeared that the laborandtimesaving device might 
prove a tottering house of cards that would bring all progress to a 
halt 
it worked this way 
the amendments were assigned to categories 
with some the skids were greased 
with others the road ahead was rocky indeed 
still others faced a fate uncertain 
category 1 amendments were offered as a package containing 
scores of legislative initiatives and eventually all were approved 
on a single bloc vote 
category 2 amendments might stand a chance but only if they 
were approved by a panel of senators from both parties decisions 
could be appealed to the senates republican and democratic leaders 
those are the purgatory amendments said senate republican 
leader bob dole of kansas they do not know where they are going 
and they may not be going anywhere 
category 3 amendments could be offered individually and face 
their chances 
category 4 amendments did not make the cut and had no chance at 
all 
it took unanimous consent of all 100 senators for the gears to 
mesh and the system to move forward 
the spur to getting that consent was the desire of many senators 
facing reelection contests to leave the capital and get on with 
campaigning 
sen ted stevens ralaska had a complaint 
i had an amendment and i find it is not even on the purgatory 
list he said 
that raises the question to me whether my amendment went to 
heaven or hell he said 
how do i find that out 
it went to hell replied sen phil gramm rtexas 
stevens i know the senator from texas might want me to go 
there but where did my amendment go 
dole it is on list no 4 
what happens to list no 4 stevens asked 
nothing dole replied

bean soup that enduring congressional culinary tradition has 
been on the menu of the united states senate restaurant for most of 
the days of this century every day for the last 85 years at least 
but being on the menu does not necessarily mean being on the 
stove or on the table 
and one day 45 years ago senate republican leader bob dole 
recalled the bean soup pots stopped bubbling for the first time 
ever 
even though bean soup was on the menu that day at 10 cents a 
cup 15 cents a bowl it wasnt cooking on the stove dole said 
the day was sept 14 1943 and the senate was beanless and 
therefore soupless 
this was because wartime rationing had slashed the senates 
supply of white michigan beans dole explained 
somehow by the next day more beans were found and bowls of 
bean soup have been ladled up without any interruption ever 
since he said 
bean soup is on the menu in the senate because it was ordered to 
be there 
there is some question as to who gave the orders 
some attribute the decree to sen fred thomas dubois of idaho 
bean soup was his favorite and he presided over the senate rules 
committee which in turn presided over the senate restaurant 
therefore bean soup went on the menu 
others say the demand was made in 1903 by sen knute nelson of 
minnesota 
the rage for bean soup soon spread to the house and in 1904 
speaker joe cannon an illinois republican was outraged that the 
menu of the house restaurant did not list it 
for years cannons words on the subject were also printed on the 
house menu along with a recipe for the now famous soup 
thunderation i had my mouth set for bean soup from now on hot 
or cold rain snow or shine i want it on the menu every day 
there are many differences in the operating styles of the house 
and senate and dole said that the preparation of bean soup is one 
of them 
the senate recipe calls for adding onions braised in butter 
the house recipe calls for beans beans beans nothing but 
beans

the internal revenue service could collect 
billions of dollars more a year by using the same aggressive 
enforcement tactics against businesses that it uses against 
individual taxpayers a congressional report says 
the report by the government operations subcommittee on 
commerce consumer and monetary affairs comes amid a presidential 
campaign in which democratic candidate michael dukakis has made 
more aggressive collection of unpaid taxes a cornerstone of his 
economic proposals 
the subcommittee report released monday says the irs should 
develop a program to match information returns showing interest 
and dividend income paid to businesses with the actual tax returns 
filed by each company 
the report estimated that between 32 billion and 8 billion a 
year in taxes on interest and dividends earned by businesses is 
never collected because the income is not reported to the irs 
the irs for years has been using its computers to compare 
information returns listing interest and dividend payments to 
individuals with the income tax returns filed by the individuals 
the program produced 235 billion in additional tax revenue from 
individuals in fiscal 1985 
banks and corporations are not required to file such information 
returns but the house report said the irs still received 26 
million such returns in 1985 showing income payments to 5 million 
businesses totaling 987 billion 
rep doug barnard dga chairman of the subcommittee has 
introduced legislation to mandate the filing of information returns 
by businesses he said the irs hasnt even been using the corporate 
returns it has been receiving without such a requirement 
by casting these information returns aside irs is not only 
missing the chance to assess many billions of dollars of unreported 
business tax liabilities but has created a double standard of 
enforcement that is more lenient by far toward businesses than 
individuals barnard said 
irs spokesman frank keith said monday the agency has not seen 
the house report and will not comment until agency officials review 
it 
but at a hearing before barnards subcommittee last year irs 
commissioner lawrence b gibbs said the additional tax revenue that 
would be generated by a document matching program for corporations 
would not justify the administrative costs 
gibbs said those costs would be much higher than for the 
document matching program for individuals because corporations use 
different fiscal years varying accounting methods and different 
names 
the house report said the problems cited by gibbs all pertain 
to the way income is reported to the irs 
the irs never considered the desirability of modifying the 
reporting requirements nor assessed the feasibility of a partial 
document matching program encompassing those corporations to which 
the difficulties do not pertain the report said 
gibbs promised the subcommittee last year that the irs would 
begin using document matching to verify income reported on tax 
returns from singleowner businesses and would start a multiyear 
study to determine the extent of business underreporting of 
interest and dividend income 
he also said the agency would begin a test program using 
information returns to detect corporations and partnerships that do 
not file any income tax returns 
that test program in one district office was so successful the 
house report said that the irs now has expanded it to nine more 
districts and could have a document matching program ready by next 
spring to identify nonfilers among corporations and partnerships 
nationwide 
despite such efforts barnard said the irs still has not been 
sufficiently diligent in attempting to extend its sophisticated 
computer matching capabilities to businesses 
individuals and now sole proprietors who know that each and 
every one of their returns will be scrutinized by irs computers for 
unreported income deserve to know why corporate and partnership 
returns are being excused from this automatic examination 
process he said

the government is investigating complaints 
that about 100000 pickup trucks made by general motors corp may 
have a tendency to go out of control because of a defective bolt 
that harms the vehicles braking system 
the national highway traffic safety administration said monday 
it had opened an investigation into unconfirmed reports of brake 
problems involving 1988 chevrolet and gmc halfton pickup trucks 
it also undertook six other probes involving major automakers 
one person reportedly died when a gm pickup trucks rearbrake 
backing bolt broke off and fell into the brake assembly the agency 
said 
the agency said it had received two other unconfirmed reports of 
the brake problem 
david hudgens a spokesman at gms detroit headquarters said 
the company would cooperate fully with the investigation 
just because there is an inquiry doesnt mean there is a 
defect he said that would remain to be seen 
the six other investigations started by the agency in september 
were in response to complaints of 
antilock braking failure in 43000 19851987 lincoln 
continentals the agency said it had received nine unconfirmed 
complaints including one that involved an accident 
compartment fires in 19801988 ford crown victorias equipped 
with the 58liter v8 engine the vehicles are used mainly by 
police departments the agency reported eight complaints 
fires and loss of power steering caused by a powersteering 
hose in 90000 1986model buick lesabres the agency received two 
complaints one of which involved a fire 
burned carpeting from overheated exhaust systems in 64000

complaints 
sudden separation of the steering wheel in 40000 1987 
volkswagen fox vehicles the agency received two complaints 
fuel expulsion in the gms p30 chassis used by other 
manufacturers as a base for motor homes 
engineers at the traffic safety agency found no defect trend in 
preliminary evaluations of four defect complaints involving major 
manufacturers and closed the investigations the complaints 
involved 
throttle control problems in the 19871988 chrysler jeep 
halfshaft failure in the 19841986 ford tempo and topaz

no defect trends were found in two engineering analyses the 
next highest level of investigation involving major manufacturers 
the investigations were into complaints of rearbrake lockup on the

a routine repainting job led to the discovery 
of a footlong crack in an aging continental airlines boeing 737 
five months after the government had ordered special inspections to 
look for such flaws 
a spokesman for continental confirmed that the large crack as 
well as 29 smaller ones were discovered near a window of the 
firstclass section after paint was stripped from the plane in 
preparation for repainting oct 5 
the cracks stretched about 30 inches along a joint where 
sections of metal skin overlap according to investigators of the 
national transportation safety board whose metallurgists are 
examining the section 
ntsb chairman james kolstad called it a chilling discovery 
in a speech monday to an aviation group in montreal and said it was 
frightening because the cracking was found in the same 
general area where an aloha airlines plane broke apart last april 
while in flight 
the ntsb has yet to issue a finding of the reason for the aloha 
breakup although it has been widely speculated that corrosion and 
a type of cold bonding used in older boeing 737s played a part 
a 20foot section of the aloha jet tore away during flight 
sweeping a flight attendant to her death the plane miraculously 
landed safely despite the gaping hole 
the aloha and continental planes both were built in 1969 using 
the cold bonding method while the aloha plane had 89000 takeoffs 
and landings at the time of the incident the continental aircraft 
had only 55446 such cycles officials said 
the aloha plane was no 152 off the boeing assembly line while 
the continental jet was no 17o 
federal aviation administration officials cautioned against 
drawing too close a parallel between the aloha incident and the 
cracks found on the continental jet 
one faa official speaking on condition he not be further 
identified said the cracks on the continental jet were located 
lower on the aircraft near a window where repair work apparently 
had been performed by a previous owner of the plane 
the faa last may issued an order that all older boeing 737s 
those with at least 30000 cycles undergo a special visual 
inspection for cracking planes with at least 55000 cycles had to 
undergo eddy current tests using highfrequency electronic 
equipment along the top of the aircraft 
ned walker a spokesman for continental said the aircraft in 
question had been visually inspected as required by the faa last 
may and no cracks were found he said the section where the 
footlong crack was discovered oct 5 was not subject to the more 
sophisticated electronic eddy current test under the faa 
directive 
an faa spokesman bob buckhorn said the agency expects to issue 
a new directive soon to airlines broadening the inspection 
requirements including increased use of eddy current testing the 
new rule also will require that the planes be stripped of paint 
when inspected he said 
walker said after the cracking was discovered oct 5 
continental inspected all 42 of its older boeing 737s within 72 
hours and found no cracking problems with any of the planes 
this appears to be an isolated incident he said from 
continentals headquarters in houston 
the boeing 737 is widely used for shorthaul flights according 
to the boeing co 212 older boeing 737s operated by 19 us 
airlines in domestic service were subject to the special faa 
inspection requirements last may 
a boeing spokesman said the manufacturer was aware of the cracks 
discovered by continental but referred all questions to the 
airline

farmers soon will be getting information from 
a new computer system devised by the agriculture department to help 
them select only the best cows for their milking herds the cream 
of the crop so to speak 
the genetic evaluation system called the animal model takes 
into account more of a cows relatives than does the older system 
the modified contemporary comparison which has been used since 
1974 the departments agricultural research service said monday 
under the new system milk production of a cows daughters will 
be considered when the mother is being evaluated and the 
evaluation of bulls based in part on the records of the males 
offspring also take into account the impact of the bulls mate on 
those offspring 
the new system will be used for the first time in dairy genetic 
evaluations to be prepared in july 1989 the report said the 
information then will be reported to dairy farmers who can use it 
to decide which cows and their calves to keep in the herd 
with this information in hand the farmer can select with more 
accuracy the calves likely to be the most efficient milk 
producers the report said 
the new system a revision of the older method was developed by 
george r wiggans a research geneticist at the agencys facility 
in beltsville md the older method was developed by duane norman 
also of beltsville 
agency work in genetic evaluation for many years has been an 
important part of a nationwide effort to improve the us dairy 
herd milk output rose from 7029 pounds per cow in 1960 to 13293 
pounds in 1986 the report said 
the trend has continued with usda figures showing the average 
milk production last year rose further to an average of 13932 
pounds 
approximately 60000 farmers participate in the improvement 
program which involves recording milk production of each cow for 
one day every month the report said information on each 
animal is compiled and sent to the animal improvement programs 
laboratory at beltsville home to approximately 39 million milk 
production records on 15 million cows 
the participating dairy farmers then receive reports on each of 
their animals the report said 
wiggans began working on the new system two years ago and in may 
1987 transferred the programs to computers at the cornell national 
supercomputer facility ithaca ny 
the cornell supercomputer has a very large memory which was 
necessary to handle all the additional details of the evaluations 
including all the relatives of milk cows he said

the financial worth of burley tobacco 
producers is far below the national average for other farmers but 
they also have fewer debts an agriculture department study says 
the study by the departments economic research service involved 
273 burley tobacco farms surveyed by questionnaire in kentucky and 
tennessee for the 1984 crop the most recent information available 
it said the net worth of burley tobacco producers averaged 
130715 substantially below the 322732 average for all us 
farm producers the average farm debt for burley farms was about a 
third less than the average for all us farm producers 
according to the report which was distributed here on monday 
the farms produced an average of 23 acres of burley a cigarette 
tobacco the crop is labor intensive and required an average of 240 
hours of family and hired labor per acre or 13 hours per 100

a new labeling law in portugal may restrict 
that countrys imports of soybean oil in favor of other kinds of 
vegetable oil according to an agriculture department trade report 
the law requires that some labels for edible vegetable oil 
containers indicated oil for dressing and frying while other 
labels indicate oil for dressing only says the departments 
foreign agricultural service 
basis for the labeling is whether the vegetable oil contains 2 
percent or less of linolenic acid which would qualify as oil for 
dressing and frying if the acid content is more than that it 
would be restricted to dressings 
sunflowerseed oil which is produced widely in the european 
economic community has the lower acid content and would qualify as 
a dualpurpose oil portugal is a member of the eec however 
soybean oil mostly from outside the eec including the united 
states has 7 percent linolenic acid and would be restricted to 
dressings the report said

some us aid to egyptian and pakistani 
government agencies undercuts the reagan administration policy of 
helping private business and discouraging governmentowned 
enterprise congressional investigators have concluded 
a report by the general accounting office which monitors 
government spending for congress cited as an example the fact that 
the agency for international development had encouraged pakistan to 
end agricultural subsidies but also had financed 142 million in 
fertilizer and 123 million in wheat and cotton imports that the 
pakistani government sells to farmers and consumers at subsidized 
prices 
the largest of these commodity import programs benefit egypt 
and pakistan egypt has had 3 billion worth of this kind of aid 
since 1975 the report said 
official aid policy holds that goods received by 
governmentowned enterprises at subsidized prices hurt a countrys 
development because they discourage sales at market prices 
the gao also reported that the egyptian government had piled up 
325 million worth of egyptian pounds representing more than half 
the proceeds from sales of us aid goods instead of using the 
money for development projects 
the cost of this large accumulation of local currencies 
remaining idle is high in terms of missed opportunities to support 
development the report said 
the report included a memo from richard e bissell the 
assistant aid administrator saying that the egyptian government 
has tentatively promised to release about 165 million worth of the 
local currency for development efforts this year and next 
the congressional investigators said that when asked about the 
situation aid officials in pakistan and egypt acknowledged the 
detrimental effects of subsidies but said the political dimension 
of these programs limited their leverage in moving these programs 
to achieve greater impact

police arrested 214 of about 1000 
demonstrators who tried unsuccessfully to blockade the pentagon 
during a protest of us policy on el salvador 
authorities said most of the arrests monday were on charges of 
obstructing passage 
there were scattered episodes of fisticuffs between police and 
demonstrators and three people were charged with assault but the 
protesters failed to achieve their goal of stopping pentagon 
workers from entering the building 
the demonstration was sponsored by a coalition of a halfdozen 
peace groups 
the protesters succeeded in forcing defense department workers 
to abandon the huge parking lot south of the pentagon which 
normally accommodates 3700 cars and to run a human gauntlet 
through selected entrances to get to their offices 
but they didnt shut down the building they just created a 
lot of inconvenience and long walks said glenn flood a pentagon 
spokesman 
police including one officer who was attacked by protesters 
arrested several people when they sat in a road to block a military 
bus from entering the parking lot 
one demonstrator sprayed red paint across the front of a bus 
protesters then pushed one defense protective service officer to 
the ground when he tried to arrest the demonstrator and beat the 
officer before other officers rescued him 
the demonstrators oppose us aid to the salvadoran government 
which has been engaged in a war against leftist guerrillas since 
1980 an estimated 60000 people have died in that conflict which 
has produced continuing allegations of death squad killings by 
policemen and soldiers 
the united states considers el salvador one of its closest 
allies in central america 
the protesters maintain the leftist guerrillas are willing to 
negotiate an end to the fighting but that the salvadoran government 
backed by the united states refuses to compromise in any way 
on monday they offered loud chants of opposition to us 
policies yelling no violence no war us out of el 
salvador and hey hey ho ho the pentagon has got to go

a dozen black operators of burger king corp 
restaurants have charged in a lawsuit that the fastfood company 
gave black franchise holders uprofitable locations and reserved 
more lucrative outlets for white operators 
the discrimination and antitrust lawsuit filed in us 
district court in washington on monday charged that burger king 
also gave white operators more favorable financing terms 
blacks were charged as much as twice what white operators paid 
to purchase or lease stores and equipment the lawsuit said 
joyce myers a burger king spokeswoman said monday we cant 
really respond until we have had an opportunity to see the suit and 
evaluate what the allegations are 
the miamibased company also was accused of discouraging black 
franchise holders from expanding to other locations by thwarting 
their attempts to obtain loans 
the black operators also charged that the company did not give 
them the opportunity to obtain franchises for lucrative downtown 
locations which subsequently were awarded to whites 
blacks who were awarded franchises in middle and upperincome 
neighborhoods were leased stores that had deficient equipment 
poor dining facilities poor parking and drivethru locations and 
inferior sales potential the suit said 
the lawsuit which seeks 500 million in punitive and 
compensatory damages also accused company officials of trying to 
harass threaten coerce intimidate and otherwise malign 
franchise holders after learning of their plans to file the suit 
the lawsuit also charged that burger king intentionally 
misrepresented the sales potential of locations sold to black 
operators 
in addition to the 12 named plaintiffs the lawsuit was brought 
on behalf of some 100 current and former black franchise holders by 
the minority business enterprise legal defense amp education fund a 
nonprofit publicinterest law firm

michael dukakis and george bush may be the 
attentiongetters but they certainly wont be the only presidential 
candidates on the ballot on election day 
democrat dukakis and republican bush will appear in some states 
with a host of lesserknowns each of whom wants that coveted job 
as leader of the free world 
from new york psychologist lenora b fulani of the new alliance 
party to libertarian ron paul of texas the handful of long shot 
presidential hopefuls runs the spectrum of political leanings 
there are 17 otherparty candidates in all according to the 
federal election commission 
some are not new to the process former minnesota sen eugene j 
mccarthy an unsuccessful candidate in 1968 for the democratic 
presidential nomination who also ran in 1972 and 1976 materializes 
again this year on four state ballots 
the 72yearold is cast as a progressive in minnesota an 
independent in michigan and a consumer candidate in new jersey and 
pennsylvania he entered the 1988 race he says because there is 
no real choice between democrats and republicans 
this time around mccarthy proclaims i dont expect to lose 
fulani the first black female presidential candidate to win a 
ballot slot in all 50 states and the district of columbia has a 
more modest goal in mind to see that dukakis gets buried on nov 
8 
the standardbearer of the new alliance party which originally 
supported the candidacy of democrat jesse jackson fulani says she 
hopes to draw enough votes away from dukakis to make the democratic 
party take notice 
asked which candidate she prefers fulani says thats like 
asking black people in slavery if theyd rather have a good master 
or a bad one i dont like their parties theyre plastic 
people 
another long shot presidential hopeful is ron paul appearing on 
most ballots as a libertarian a former republican congressman from 
texas he quit the gop in 1987 saying president reagan had presided 
over a government of massive budget deficits and too many 
bureaucrats 
given a choice paul says he would deregulate everything and 
you get rid of all the bums all the bureaucrats who are running 
the bureaus 
and there are lesserknown candidates as well including 
socialist willa kenoyer who will appear on seven state ballots 
i learned my socialism on my daddys knee back in the 
mid1930s said kenoyer a freelance writer from shelby mich 
while she says her party is more interested in spreading its 
ideas than trying to put a socialist in the white house she still 
has plans should she happen to make it that far 
the first hour kenoyer says would be spent dismantling the 
cia the second hour the fbi goes 
political extremist lyndon larouche under indictment for fraud 
and conspiracy is also listed in several states often under the 
banner of national economic recovery party or democrats for 
economic recovery party 
historically thirdparty candidates have a difficult time in 
1968 thensegregationist george wallace of alabama mounted the 
biggest votegetting campaign for a thirdparty candidate in the 
nations history and he attracted just 10 million votes 
in 1984 libertarian david bergland finished in third place 
behind reagan and walter f mondale drawing only 227204 votes

the presidential campaign motorcade 
speeds down a texas freeway at about 75 mph but without secret 
service agents a police escort and highway roadblocks 
the motorcade consists of three cars the candidate in the 
front seat of a fourdoor ford that has a radar detector perched on 
the dashboard and two reporters weaving their vehicles in and out 
of traffic desperately trying to keep pace 
this is no ordinary national political campaign 
if a dark suit light blue shirt and red striped tie make for 
the classic uniform of a presidential hopeful then ron paul is 
playing the part correctly but thats where the similarity to 
republican nominee george bush and democratic contender michael 
dukakis ends 
the 53yearold paul a former fourterm gop congressman from 
texas is the libertarian party nominee for president his campaign 
is lowkey and its operating budget miniscule compared to bush and 
dukakis but he will share a ballot spot next month with his 
betterknown rivals in 47 states and the district of columbia 
the odds arent very good paul said of his presidential 
chances during a recent campaign stop in jersey village northwest 
of houston but the odds are very good that we are going to take 
hold in this country were realistic in knowing were not going to 
be elected this year but were not a flybynight operation 
pauls campaign is not so much aimed at electing him but about 
promoting the philosophy of the libertarians who claim a 
membership of more than 200000 nationwide the party has fielded a 
presidential candidate in every election since 1972 and garnered 
about 250000 votes in the 1984 contest 
paul by profession an obstetrician and gynecologist rarely 
refers to himself during campaign appearances preferring instead 
to tout his partys goals of a completely free marketplace 
unbridled civil liberties and a noninterventionist foreign policy 
were spoiling the comfort of the politicians who wont deal 
with the problems and are bankrupting the country he said 
thats a great role 
paul a true opponent of government interference and 
bureaucracy favors abolishing the personal income tax and the 
internal revenue service disbanding the fbi pulling us troops 
out of europe and the far east and eliminating all drug laws thus 
making illegal drugs legal 
he would also let private firms handle social security return 
the country to the gold standard and get the government out of 
public education 
paul who served in congress from 1976 to 1984 says he quit the 
republicans after becoming disenchanted with ronald reagan 
he told me he would get the government off my back he said 
but look whats happening if you look at the irs or dea or ins 
or whoever theyre not off our backs theyre into our wallets and 
into our bedrooms and into our private lives more so than ever 
before 
his rather populist message draws a smattering of enthusiastic 
applause during campaign appearances on the drug issue however 
some of the opposition can get hostile especially when paul 
suggests it should be left up to the individual whether to use 
narcotics 
i was in favor of everything he says until he got to the drug 
issue joseph azmeh 19 a university of houston student said 
after a recent paul campaign appearance i have a small brother 
and he watches tv and i know how advertising affects him 
paul believes making drugs legal would reduce crime by 50 
percent and eliminate the profit motive for drug dealers since the 
substances would be readily available 
its pretty hard to get a young person to work for 4 an hour 
when they can make 400 a day pushing drugs he said those 
profits and high salaries would be gone if drugs werent so 
artificially pumped up in price 
he also draws disapproving murmurs when he suggests that the 
nations space program should be left to private companies 
whether or not i ever run for another office again is 
irrelevant paul said im dealing in ideas that are important 
to me and my family i know i will work for those ideas because 
they are so important and so valuable 
after nearly 10 months fulltime on the campaign trail after 
appearances in nearly all of the states paul says he has a feeling 
of tiredness but not futility 
i see in the 1990s we could very well be a major party he 
says

black voters will be having less of a decisive 
impact in this years senate races than two years ago even though 
two candidates are black because few of the contests are being 
held in the south 
there arent as many races in which the black vote is a 
powerful bloc this time said tom mason a spokesman for the 
national republican senatorial committee 
two years ago senate elections were held in seven southern 
states four of which have blacks comprising more than 20 percent 
of their voting age population in all seven states democrats were 
elected or reelected to the senate 
that arithmetic was not lost on jesse jackson who tried to 
wring endorsements for his presidential campaign out of southern 
senators saying they owed their jobs to black voters 
this year however there are but three southern races for the 
senate florida mississippi and virginia and in just one 
mississippi is there a high concentration of black voters more 
than 30 percent of mississippis voting age population is black 
however in that state neither republican trent lott nor 
democrat wayne dowdy both of whom are congressmen running to 
succeed retiring sen john stennis has tailored his campaign 
messages to make a special appeal to blacks although both 
acknowledge the importance of such a large bloc of voters their 
campaign spokesmen said 
our message is very simple we are offering opportunity tim 
carpenter campaign manager for lott said in a telephone 
interview we want to bring more and better jobs to mississippi 
if you look all over our advertising its pretty monotone 
he said 
lotts strategy to win black support is direct were 
asking said carpenter that sounds pretty simple but we are 
were not giving up any vote to wayne dowdy he said 
hes spending a lot of money said dowdy campaign spokesman 
dean pittman but basically what hes spending money on is 
disguising his abysmal record on civil rights 
while polls show lott leading overall in the senate race they 
also indicate he has barely dented black support for dowdy 
an independent poll conducted in late september and early 
october by masondixon opinion research showed lott leading dowdy 
49 percent to 41 percent with 10 percent undecided among black 
voters though the poll shows dowdy with a 10to1 lead over lott 
the poll which surveyed 812 likely voters has a margin of 
error of plus or minus 35 percentage points 
although there are two majorparty black candidates running for 
the senate this year maurice dawkins in virginia and alan l keyes 
in maryland both are republicans and are considered long shots in 
races against popular democrats former gov charles robb in 
virginia and sen paul sarbanes in maryland 
both republicans and democrats say the two black senate 
candidates are not tokens nominated to water down traditional 
support for the democrats 
dawkins was in no sense handpicked said anita dunn 
spokeswoman for the democratic senatorial campaign committee in 
keyes case he has fought any attempt to make it look like he is a 
token black running

republican presidential nominee george bush held 
a 17point lead in a new national poll and nearly three quarters 
of the respondents said they expected him to win next months 
election 
the nbc newswall street journal poll monday put the race at 
5538 percent bushs biggest lead over democrat michael dukakis 
since the campaign began the margin was considerably greater than 
in surveys earlier this month 
told of the result dukakis campaign chairman paul brountas 
said i dont believe it he said the campaigns own polls 
indicated a smaller unspecified deficit with more undecided 
voters 
it was the first fullsized poll after thursdays debate in 
which smaller overnight polls found bush the winner bush led 
dukakis by 10 points in those polls but they were conducted only 
among debate viewers a more republican group bush led by five or 
six points in most predebate polls 
said brountas if there has been an increase in the gap it may 
be attributable to some of the stories about the debate 
the nbcjournal poll was conducted friday through sunday among 
1378 likely voters and had a threepoint margin of error almost 
threequarters of the respondents said they expected bush to win 
the election including half of dukakis own supporters 
dukakis was rated favorably by 36 percent down from 50 percent 
a month ago bush was favorably rated by 55 percent up from 50 
percent bush led chiefly among men they backed him by 6430 
percent while the race among women was a nearly even with bush 
ahead 4844

alderman edward burke a feisty onetime policeman 
known as a political opponent of the late mayor harold washington 
said monday he would run for mayor and try to unite the city 
burkes entry is another in a crowded field of democratic 
candidates seeking to win a special mayoral election and serve the 
final two years of washingtons fouryear term 
the citys first black mayor who died suddenly last november 
considered burke who is white one of his chief opponents in the 
city council 
burke acknowledging his reputation might be tarnished among 
blacks and some liberals by council battles against washington 
allies said he should have acted differently 
it takes humility to admit publicly that i have made mistakes 
and there are many things i would change he said but i would 
be unfit for future government service if i did not have the 
strength to admit my errors 
burke 45 said he would stay in the race if the money is 
there if i have support 
burke has served in the city council since 1969 when at age 24 
he succeeded his late father alderman joseph burke 
a week after washingtons death aldermen installed eugene 
sawyer as acting mayor he is expected to run next year but has not 
made an official announcement 
alderman tim evans also is expected to be a candidate although 
he has not made an official declaration rounding out the 
democratic field aldermen danny davis and lawrence bloom former 
parks boss edmund kelly and former alderman aloysius majerczyk say

lions stopped roaring monday as flames 
threatened a shelter for abandoned exotic animals as well as a 
home for disturbed children and a second blaze headed toward 
ancient trees in sequoia national park as fires burned more than 
5900 acres in california 
if the wind picks up it could flare up into a 40foot sheet of 
fire and a fireball could roll over us without batting an eyelid 
said martine colette spokeswoman for wildlife waystation the 
animal shelter in angeles national forests little tujunga canyon 
area 30 miles northwest of downtown los angeles 
several blazes including a 1500acre fire burning near trees 
up to 2700 years old in sequoia erupted during the weekend when 
california was blasted with temperatures near 100 degrees in some 
areas and dry desert wind gusting to 30 mph 
national weather service meteorologist mark mckinley said 
southern california will experience a cooling trend in the next 
couple of days but with 25 mph mountain wind conditions wouldnt 
change much for firefighters until tuesday night or wednesday 
morning 
us forest service spokeswoman marilyn hartley said the 
3100acre divide brush fire was 1 miles from wildlife waystation 
but colette insisted flames pushed to within threequarters of a 
mile the shelter is home to more than 1000 creatures including 
tigers giraffes and a wide variety of other abandoned exotic pets 
plus wild animals that wandered into residential neighborhoods 
we will have to make our stand here colette said it 
would not be feasible to evacuate the animals the animals are 
extremely quiet the lions stopped roaring and the coyotes stopped 
howling they can smell the fire 
the refuge was expected to remain safe as long as winds didnt 
whip up during the night waystation vice president jan brown said 
late monday 
the fire which was 20 percent contained moved toward and then 
past about seven homes in the little tujunga canyon area north of 
sylmar and northeast of los angeles san fernando valley there was 
no damage but most of the families evacuated said los angeles 
county sheriffs sgt guy gutierrez 
officials at the waystation and at hathaway childrens services 
a home for 125 emotionally disturbed children in little tujunga 
canyon also were told they might need to evacuate if the fire got 
closer the sergeant said 
officials estimated that blaze will be surrounded by fire lines 
by wednesday evening and extinguished two days later forest 
service spokeswoman kim vanderhaar said two firefighters suffered 
minor injuries 
more than 600 firefighters were aided by nine air tankers and 
three helicopters that began dropping water and fireretardant 
chemicals at dawn monday as the blaze burned dry brush in 
inaccessible mountainous terrain said los angeles county 
firefighter stan pearson 
three men were initially suspected of starting the fire with an 
illegal campfire a felony punishable by up to six years in prison 
but the men were released monday said deputy hal grant because 
it appears a 10yearold boy has admitted to it 
in sequoia national park 600 firefighters battled to protect 
the 3squaremile giant forest a grove of trees considered the 
largest living things on earth said forest service spokeswoman 
michele case 
flames are right now at the edge of the forest but a 
successful backfire broadened a buffer zone around the grove she 
said 
the majestic trees can survive fires because their thick bark 
can withstand considerable heat and flame but a sequoia tree is 
fireresistant not fireproof case said 
authorities also were concerned about a restaurant hotel 
cabins and gas station about three miles from the flames she added 
case said the fire broke out sunday morning at a camping area on 
the middle fork of the kaweah river about 30 miles northeast of 
visalia and 175 miles north of los angeles one hundred campers 
left so a fire camp could be established she added 
the fire was blamed on a careless camper or fisherman because 
there was no lightning in the area at the time case said 
firefighters contained a brush fire monday that burned more than 
800 acres in riverside county near hemet said cheri hill a 
spokeswoman for the california division of forestry 
a 300acre brush fire burned out of control near us 95 about 
20 miles north of blythe near the arizona border hill said it 
threatened some homes sunday but posed no danger to dwellings 
monday she added 
hill said 15 small brush fires that started sunday throughout 
riverside county were extinguished some were arson others were 
caused by campfires and one was ignited by a motorcycles hot 
exhaust pipe she said 
two more weekend fires erupted in the mountainous eastern 
section of the angeles national forest one destroyed a house near 
the mount baldy ski resort

former president gen leopoldo 
galtieri on trial for mismanaging the 1982 war with britain over 
the falkland islands says he would invade the territory again and 
does not regret starting a war 
would i do it again given the same circumstances and 
conditions would i proceed in the same manner the answer is yes 
i lt gen galtieri would proceed the same way as i did 
galtieri said in federal appeals court on monday what was done 
was done well 
galtieri and two other members of the former ruling junta adm 
jorge anaya and brig gen basilio lami dozo were convicted in 
may 1986 by the supreme council of the armed forces of military 
mismanagement all were sentenced to prison 
on july 26 their appeal began in civilian court along with 
three officers who had been acquitted by the militarys highest 
tribunal vice adm juan jose lombardo gen mario menendez and 
gen omar parada 
the issue is how the war was handled including galtieris 
decision to send about 12000 troops to the islands located 250 
miles northeast of tierra del fuego off the southernmost tip of 
south america 
prosecutor luis moreno ocampo questioned the militarys tactics 
and strategy including anayas decision as head of the navy to 
virtually withdraw the fleet from combat after the cruiser general 
belgrano was sunk in early may by a british nuclear submarine 
argentine conscripts were illtrained inadequately supplied and 
poorly led witnesses said 
the conflict began on april 2 1982 and lasted 74 days about 
700 argentines were killed along with 255 british troops 
in his defense galtieri said the war for the islands that 
argentina calls the malvinas was narrowly lost so charges of 
mismanagement are illfounded 
the battle for the south atlantic militarily was lost by a 
narrow margin he said 
britain claimed the islands in 1833 argentina claims it 
inherited the islands from spain upon achieving independence in 
1810 
the underpopulated windswept islands are home to about 1900 
people mostly sheep ranchers and fishermen also at stake are the 
rights to potentially large deposits of oil and other natural 
resources 
for argentina nationalism is a factor every map calls the 
islands the malvinas every school child learns they were seized 
from argentina and should be returned 
galtieri who was sentenced to 12 years in prison by the 
military tribunal and who faces a stiffer 20year sentence if he 
loses his appeal was not repentant when he addressed the civilian 
court 
in 1982 destiny knocked at the doors of the nation he 
said and the people with dignity decided to fulfill a 
historical obligation and reclaim the islands 
the courts decision was expected by early next week

a top federal official says americans should 
look to television networks and other news outlets if they think 
the government should be more forthright in calling for use of 
condoms to combat the spread of aids 
a new wave of television spots unveiled monday does not mention 
what one reporter called the c word but leaves little to the 
imagination of any viewer who has heard that condoms can help 
prevent spread of the deadly disease 
the 1987 series of television ads distributed to national 
networks and thousands of individual stations contained direct 
references to condoms in some spots that got little airplay despite 
18 million worth of free airtime devoted to less controversial 
messages 
nonetheless one of the 1988 ads features a tantalizing episode 
in which a young man talks to the camera as he puts a sock on his 
foot 
if i told you i could save my life just by putting on my 
socks you wouldnt take me seriously says the man sitting in a 
chair 
because life is never that simple he adds 
but watch 
there are a few seconds of silence as he slips a sock onto his 
foot 
okay youre right the man says that wouldnt really 
save my life but theres something just as simple that could 
questioned at a news conference dr james mason director of 
the centers for disease control said there was a simple answer to 
why the government avoided specifically mentioning condoms in the 
new round of television spots 
we had a great deal of difficulty getting the television 
stations to use that he said referring to 1987 spots that 
specifically mentioned condoms that one was selectively avoided 
by the television stations 
mason said designers of the 1987 ad campaign tried to be careful 
to produce spots that would not be offensive to audiences even 
though some of them did discuss condoms 
but he said experience showed there was another level of 
screening at networks and local tv stations that resulted in the 
condom spots rarely being seen by a general audience 
with more than a dozen cameras rolling mason was among several 
officials who declined to answer directly when asked whether 
television executives were engaging in irresponsible behavior in 
public health by declining to run condom spots 
eventually stephanie leemiller the administrations top 
public relations official in the health and human services 
department who had been moderating the news conference stepped 
forward 
ill answer it she said no theyre not engaging in 
responsible behavior 
she asked reporters to challenge the networks rather than 
the health department 
indeed the print ads and posters prepared for the new campaign 
deals with condom use in a direct way likely to draw criticism from 
conservatives 
if he wont wear a condom call for help says one suggested 
newspaper ad 
one of numerous posters features a still photo from the tv spot 
where the man is putting a sock on his foot putting on a condom 
is just as simple says the headline 
another series of six posters feature photos of three different 
men and three different women with the same headline on each what 
have you got against a condom the smaller print says the 
simple act of putting on a condom can save your life if theyre 
used properly and every time you have sex for more information 
about aids and condoms call 1800342aids 
another series features three different women all saying if 
he doesnt have a condom you just have to take a deep breath and 
tell him to go get one 
many critics have said federal officials and ogilvy amp mather 
the private advertising company hired to produce the campaign went 
too far last year in trying to get sexually active americans to use 
condoms others said the ads were not explicit enough 
mason said federal health officials have always said that 
abstinence or a monogamous relationship with an uninfected partner 
are the only two absolute ways to prevent sexual spread of aids 
condoms are third best he said adding it is nonetheless 
important for health officials to recommend their use for those who 
are not abstinent or in monogamous relationships with partners they 
are certain are uninfected

john ball who won the coveted edgar award 
for mystery writers for in the heat of the night a 
groundbreaking novel about a black detective has died he was 77 
the los angeles resident whose approximately 30 books have bene 
translated into 17 languages died saturday after a twoyear battle 
with cancer said his wife patricia 
a new murder mystery titled the van will be published this 
spring she said monday 
ball worked as a music critic for the brooklyn eagle music 
columnist for the new york world telegram and assistant curator for 
the hayden planetarium in new york 
most of his books were mysteries but he also wrote in the 
juvenile aviation and military fields 
it was as a mystery writer in california following in the steps 
of raymond chandler and dashiell hammett that ball gained renown 
instead of hardboiled world weary gumshoes like sam spade and 
philip marlowe ball created a softspoken policeman who happened 
to be black 
it was a bold move that anticipated principal roles for black 
characters in popular fiction and film 
they told him no dont make him black why not make him 
chinese or something said his wife but john insisted virgil 
tibbs must be black 
thus was born the character played by sidney poitier in the 
movie in the heat of the night which won four oscars in 1967 
for picture actor rod steiger director norman jewison and 
screenplay stirling silliphant 
believe it or not it took a long time to get it published 
mrs ball said he was going to let it go for almost nothing 
the book was in the hands of a small publisher that went out of 
business so it was picked up by another publisher his wife said 
for his own part ball received the edgar award conferred by the 
mystery writers of america and the golden dagger by the british 
crime writers his wife said 
the tibbs character usually faced prejudice in addition to 
problems of detection but maintained his cool and went on to crack 
the case in mississippi while on a visit using his intellect and 
forensic expertise 
another ball book the first team about a war with the 
soviet union was published in 1971 more than a decade ahead of 
such currently popular works as the hunt for red october by tom 
clancy and team yankee by harold coyle 
the first team sold to a movie studio but got shelved in 
the early days of detente with the soviet union in the 1970s 
it was long before red dawn she said of the recent movie 
about a soviet invasion of the united states 
services were set for wednesday at hollywood hills forest lawn 
in addition to his wife he was survived by his son john david 
ball and his granddaughter nicole

voters in four states will decide 
whether to take a chance on a lottery in ballot measures opposed by 
religious leaders and others who say statesanctioned gambling 
exploits the poor 
idaho indiana kentucky and minnesota have lottery questions on 
nov 8s ballot the indiana proposition also would clear the way 
for parimutuel and casino gambling if the legislature approves 
polls in the states indicate support for the issues 
proponents who include gov wallace wilkinson in kentucky and 
state sen larry borst in indiana say voting yes would bring 
millions of dollars into state coffers including muchneeded money 
for education and rural economic development 
twentyeight states and the district of columbia operate 
lotteries which have grossed 148 billion in fiscal 1988 up 192 
percent from 1987 according to gambling and wagering business 
magazine based in new york of that sum 56 billion went to state 
governments and the balance to cover prizes and the cost of 
administration according to lottery officials 
opponents argue lotteries encourage betting by the people who 
can least afford it 
there are only 35 million people in kentucky said jim 
fugitte of elizabethtown ky chairman of citizens against state 
lottery a million of them are under 18 and 1 million are under 
the poverty level we cant be for something where the more the 
citizens of kentucky bet and lose the better off the state is 
indiana citizens against legalized gambling hopes to spend 
350000 on advertisements and pamphlets arguing that gambling 
would attract organized crime to the state united methodist 
churches held a get out the vote sunday to encourage 
congregations to vote no 
supporters such as borst counter that such opponents are our 
best salesmen so far as making people aware of it 
church leaders in minnesota including all lutheran and roman 
catholic bishops said they will spend the next few weeks urging 
congregations to vote no 
opposition in idaho gained impetus when morman leaders usually 
apolitical in state affairs began organizing against the lottery 
a recent report by the indiana fiscal policy institute predicts 
a lottery would produce about 134 million in annual net revenues 
for indiana which has 55 million people 
proponents in kentucky estimate the lottery could mean 70 
million a year for the state while supporters in minnesota say 
ticket sales would gross 40 million to 100 million 
in idaho with just 1 million residents pressure for the 
lottery has come from the western and northern parts of the state 
where promoters say the state is losing millions of dollars to 
lotteries in oregon and washington they project the state could 
reap at least 2 million annually 
but the indiana institutes president earl m ryan warns that 
forecasting lottery revenues is about as chancy as winning one 
adding that it would be risky for any state to count on specific 
dollar amounts 
from a fiscal standpoint the biggest problem with lottery 
revenues is their unpredictability ryan said this means that 
it would be unwise to dedicate those revenues to functions that 
require a stable resource of funding in order to operate 
the four states stand to lose little if they opt for the game 
said john l mikesell an indiana university school of public and 
environmental affairs professor who has studied lotteries 
theyre basically guaranteed against losing money because we 
know enough about structuring prizes and operations of lottery 
he said adding that none should expect lotteries to be a booming 
success like those in more populous urban states such as 
massachusetts or maryland 
the four states voting either have substantially rural 
populations or small populations some are smackdab in between 
existing lottery states that are doing pretty well or they dont 
have a good tradition of gambling history mikesell said 
that argument isnt likely to hold water in kentucky said 
fugitte most of the community either is neutral on the issue of 
gambling or they think its all right youve got to remember this 
is a horseracing state

flaky pastry puffs filled with 
chocolate mousse float on a tray near the swirl of whipped cream 
crowning a glazed bed of strawberries and a soft jelly roll oozing 
with a tart burst of red 
for most people this is sweet torture to those attending the 
atlantic bakery expo this week this is sweetly lucrative 
bakers wandered through the expo at convention center on monday 
admiring stainless steel mixing bowls as big as jacuzzis ovens as 
big as dining rooms and a 14000 machine that pops out 175 dozen 
bagels an hour 
more than 10000 buyers were expected to attend the threeday 
expo which ends today 
the retail baking industry generates about 6 billion nationwide 
each year with 20000 independent retail bakers and another 20000 
instore bakeries across the united states according to statistics 
compiled by the retail bakers of america association 
we could say this show smells of opportunity and tastes of 
success said john charles executive secretary of the new jersey 
bakers board of trade 
the average sweet tooth might be surprised at the innovations 
for modern bakers displayed at the annual show there are still 
frosting bags and traditional wedding cake toppers decorated with 
lace but there are also gadgets such as hightech spray guns that 
use food coloring to create detailed caketop scenes 
business has been so good that we sold our bakery two years 
ago and now we sell our stencil aire products around the country 
said belinda franklin a copartner in the young cake stenciling 
firm based in ripon wis 
at the expo chris moore of the hazelwood mo farms bakeries 
promoted a line of predecorated frozen cakes and cupcakes that 
stores can thaw and sell 
its hard to find skilled labor to decorate cakes nowadays 
he said you dont find that many people want to be bakers 
anymore because of the crazy hours bakers traditionally get a 
predawn start on their day behind the stove 
but bakers who still make their own cakes are turning to 
products that save time richard dalco a spokesman for 
instantwhip food inc of columbus ohio pointed to a giant 
strawberry shortcake frosted with instantwhip whipped cream that 
comes from a carton and doesnt use heavy cream 
real heavy cream is primarily used in gourmet operations as 
long as people are willing to pay the high price he said 
but dalco didnt have to continue touting his product a 
husbandwife baking team stopped at his booth to rave 
real whipped cream turns into water if you beat it too much 
said rose hamilton coowner of the bel air md bakery 
fresh whipped cream is the worst thing you could use said 
her husband james 
even the decorations on cakes can be premade sam guttman 
president of bakery crafts of cincinnati pointed to his variety of 
colorful plastic and hard sugar cake decorations 
a lot of these decorations are laborsavers he said 
someone who is a home cake decorator or hobbyist might be willing 
to spend two to three hours to decorate a cake but a baker cant 
afford that time unless its a wedding cake that can cost up to 
1000 
of course some people displaying their wares still practiced 
the old art of turning frosting into fantasy august riesterer 
owner of the riesterer bakery in west hempstead ny is a german 
native who said he has been baking for 57 years 
riesterer sat proudly behind a display of mindboggling cakes 
including some wedding cakes that seemed to defy gravity one 
featured three tiers atop pedestals with bridges connecting six 
smaller layers on either side the bride and groom stood on top 
while nine bridesmaids and nine ushers climbed the tiny stairs 
the cakes cost about 500 each he said

former moonies can sue the unification 
church for alleged deception and brainwashing because freedom of 
religion does not protect fraudulent recruiting the state supreme 
court said in reinstating two suits 
a lawyer for the national council of churches called mondays 
61 ruling a real blow to freedom of religion 
the challenge here is not to the churchs teachings or to 
the validity of a religious conversion said justice stanley mosk 
in the decision 
the challenge is to the churchs practice of misrepresenting 
or concealing its identity in order to bring unsuspecting outsiders 
into its highly structured environment that practice is not itself 
belief it is conduct subject to regulation for the protection of 
society 
reversing two lower court rulings the high court decided that 
two former church members who brought their cases could seek to 
convince a jury that they had been brainwashed and were unable to 
exercise independent judgment when they joined the rev sun myung 
moons church after being told of its identity 
in dissent appeals court presiding justice carl anderson 
assigned to the supreme court for the case said religious 
conversion whether or not it involves brainwashing is 
constitutionally protected from court scrutiny 
brainwashing and religious conversion are not really 
distinguishable anderson said noting there were no claims of 
force or threatened violence in the case 
kenneth ross a lawyer for the church said he would recommend 
an appeal to the us supreme court 
lawyers for the plaintiffs whose lawsuits had been rejected in 
san francisco superior court and a state appellate court hailed 
the ruling 
the court recognized the rights of people who have been 
exploited by the dishonest and unethical practice of religion 
said ford greene lawyer for david molko 
until this case was decided cults had taken the position that 
they could do whatever they chose to do with respect to deception 
and fraud in their recruitment activities and claim that they were 
immune from responsibility by virtue of the first amendment said 
stanley leal attorney for his daughter tracy 
but kathleen purcell a lawyer for the american baptist churches 
in the usa and the national council of churches who filed 
written arguments supporting the unification church called the 
ruling a real blow to both free exercise of religion and the 
separation of church and state 
she said it was the first ruling of its kind by any states high 
court 
ms leal now 28 and studying for a teaching credential at san 
jose state university was a 19yearold college student when a 
recruiter approached her at a san francisco bus station in 1979 a 
few months earlier molko a 27yearold pennsylvania lawyer newly 
arrived in san francisco also was recruited at a bus stop 
both said the recruiters denied any church affiliation instead 
claimed membership in the creative community project and invited 
them to dinner soon afterward they said they were taken to a 
retreat and subjected to intensive lectures discussions and 
exercise molko said he was not told of the moon affiliation for 12 
days and ms leal for 22 days 
both remained church members for several months before they were 
abducted by deprogrammers hired by their parents the court 
said 
their lawsuits sought damages from the church for emotional 
distress and punitive damages molko also sought return of his 
6000 he donated to the church

president corazon aquino faces a hard 
road in selling the newly concluded us bases agreement to the 
public and may be forced to harden her position on the thornier 
issue of the installations status after 1991 
first reaction to the agreement signed monday in washington 
was at best mixed major newspapers accused the government of 
selling out by agreeing to allow the six bases to remain through 
1991 in return for only 962 million in american aid 
that was more than 2 times the 180 million a year which 
president reagan pledged in 1983 over a fiveyear period to 
nowousted president ferdinand marcos 
but the fact that the philippines won far more us assistance 
was all but lost on the public and press due to the governments 
having raised expectations which us diplomats all along said were 
unrealistic 
even before the talks began april 5 manila newspapers quoted 
unidentified government sources as saying the aquino administration 
would insist on 12 billion a year 
foreign secretary raul manglapus never explicitly confirmed the 
12 billion demand but termed it reasonable manglapus aides 
privately told filipino reporters that the government would hold 
fast to its demands 
manglapus himself said repeatedly that compensation was not the 
only issue but other issues he cited such as confirmation of 
nuclear weapons at the bases and expanded criminal jurisdiction 
over us troops were not addressed in the new agreement 
in washington manglapus told reporters he was optimistic that 
once the filipino public understood the agreement they will 
accept it 
indeed one longtime bases opponent sen aquilino pimentel 
said the results of the negotiations are certainly much better 
than before 
but the absence of a detailed explanation by the government of 
the benefits of the agreement opened the door to criticism from the 
press and some lawmakers who hope to make the bases an issue in 
the runup to the 1992 national elections 
under the new constitution any extension after 1991 must be 
approved by twothirds of the 23member senate where opposition to 
the bases is strong 
several senators are widely assumed to harbor presidential 
ambitions and are casting for an issue in the 1992 election in 
which mrs aquino says she will not be a candidate 
the fact that the latest agreement was hammered out in 
washington and not manila raised charges that the government had 
indulged in the same kind of secret diplomacy for which the marcos 
administration had been roundly criticized 
manglapus has been in the united states for nearly a month when 
asked whether mrs aquino herself was fully aware of all aspects of 
the final negotiations her spokesman teodoro benigno replied i 
dont think so 
instead mrs aquino left details of the negotiations to 
manglapus who has not entirely shaken off his longtime image as an 
amboy or american boy a derogatory term for filipinos 
who support us interests 
that strategy appeared designed in part to allow mrs aquino to 
escape personal political damage if the public found the agreement 
unsatisfactory 
the results of the just concluded talks were expected to 
influence the governments decision on whether to negotiate a new 
pact extending the bases beyond 1991 
such negotiations assuming they are held will be difficult 
recent surveys show a majority of filipinos favor retention of 
the bases but under favorable terms including fixed rent but 
communist rebels and a significant portion of the urban middle 
class including journalists and intellectuals are strongly 
opposed to the bases regardless of the financial impact if they 
were closed 
we seem to have hung out a price tag on our sovereignty and 
national dignity wrote columnist letty jimenezmagsanoc in the 
philippine daily inquirer we are now selling out even when the 
price isnt right 
in such a climate issues which are viewed here as basic to 
national sovereignty are likely to be raised these include formal 
notification of the presence of nuclear weapons as well as military 
operations launched from philippine soil 
filipino military officers are routinely barred from some 
sensitive areas such as code rooms even though the six bases are 
nominally under philippine command

heroin smuggling charges have been dismissed 
against a key mafia informant who testified against his associates 
at the maxitrial in sicily and the pizza connection drug 
case here 
the us government officially dropped the sixcount indictment 
monday saying tommaso buscetta had fulfilled the terms of his 
cooperation agreement with the us and italian governments 
buscetta has provided and continues to provide exhaustive 
information concerning the activities of the mafia here and in 
italy said assistant us attorney thomas rose in court papers 
moreover largely as a result of buscettas testimony at 
trials in the united states and italy hundreds of defendants have 
been convicted of heroin trafficking and associated organized crime 
activity 
the drug indictment against buscetta was filed in 1973 in us 
district court in brooklyn the order to dismiss the indictment 
which contained the only outstanding charges against buscetta was 
signed by judge joseph mclaughlin 
its dismissal was included in a cooperation agreement buscetta 
entered with the us and italian governments in 1985 
rose said buscetta had been a soldier of great respect in 
the sicilian mafia where his duties included settling disputes and 
acting as an emissary between families 
his testimony at the pizza connection trial helped convict 
18 defendants of participating in a mafiabacked drug racket 
operated in part through pizza parlors that imported an estimated 
16 billion worth of heroin into the united states 
he was the prosecutions first witness at the 17month trial 
that ended in march 1986 and he identified certain defendants as 
members of the sicilian mafia 
buscetta also was among a dozen admitted mafia members who 
testified at the italian trial described as the largest mafia 
trial ever conducted more than 300 defendants were convicted in 
that case last year 
rose said buscetta would remain in a witness protection program 
administered by the federal drug enforcement administration he has 
been given a new identity and is living in this country

scotland has suffered another blow to 
its sense of separate identity the english have overrun its 
cultural establishment 
ever since 1707 when scotland and england were united under one 
crown and parliament scots have worried about being swamped by 
their english neighbors who outnumber them 111 
comes now the englishing of scotland broadcast aug 29 on 
the independent scottish television channel which shows the 
command posts of scottish culture firmly in the hands of sassenachs 
from south of the border 
not the artists mind native scottish creativity has never 
looked healthier what worries guardians of scottish identity is 
the preponderance of englishmen in a cultural bureaucracy supposed 
to be separate 
the englishing of scottish life is a process that has gone on 
for many years but many scots feel it is beginning to 
undermine the very notion of scotland george rosie the writer 
and host said in introducing the program 
rosie presented impressive of evidence of nonscot 
infiltration the nonscots being almost invariably from england 
nonscots run most of scotlands major statesubsidized arts 
institutions the national museums national galleries national 
library arts council scottish opera scottish ballet its three 
major international arts festivals and the scottish national trust 
for heritage parks and buildings 
they run five of the eight universities 10 of the 15 
governmentfunded colleges and three of the six leading theaters 
we are assimilating ourselves toward an english ideal and 
gradually i think we will assimilate ourselves out of existence 
billy kay a playwright historian and scottish nationalist said 
on the program 
paul scott a retired diplomat said i think were at very 
grave risk of ceasing to exist as a recognizable nation as a 
recognizable culture and identity the species is under threat 
while everyone saw a problem there was little agreement on the 
cause 
newspaper columnist neal ascherson said most of the institutions 
mentioned were recent creations copied from england 
the idea of cultural bureaucracies is entirely alien to 
scotland he said this is not a country which has 
traditionally been kind to the arts 
some said scots were reluctant to protest englishing for 
fear of sounding racist alan lawson editor of the leftwing 
journal radical scotland said this fear had deprived scots of 
the confidence to stand up and argue that there is a problem 
allan massie a conservative writer offered simple arithmetic 
because of the population ratio if you have a job that is 
publicly advertised and you have 10 applicants youre quite likely 
to find that seven of them come from outside scotland 
timothy clifford an englishman who heads the national gallery 
of scotland called the program absolute arrant nonsense 
he said just as many scots run english institutions but rosie 
reported no scots among 34 university heads in england and wales 
and said only two of the 21 statefunded museums art galleries and 
libraries south of the border were run by scots 
clifford argued that an englishman sometimes understands more 
and can better identify the scottishness of something than a scot 
can the program too paid tribute to the many nonscots who 
have fostered scottish art forms the scots themselves had neglected 
overall however rosies presentation painted a gloomy portrait 
of a culture hijacked by outsiders it inspired a deluge of 
commentary and letters that complained of englishing in 
everything from soccer through architecture to the englishisms 
creeping into everyday speech in scotland 
the advisory council for the arts in scotland weighed in with 
worry about the survival of scotland as anything more than a 
geographical expression 
rosie said the letters ran 82 in support of his conclusions 
which are that certain jobs should be reserved for people who are 
educated and brought up in scotland and understand the nuances of 
scottish culture 
he acknowledges the impossibility of barring englishmen from 
jobs in scotland since both are part of britain but added in an 
interview its similarly daft that so many such jobs are being 
taken by nonscots thats the ambivalence of our whole 
constitutional situation 
the broadcast coincides with a broadly based campaign for 
limited independence that is gathering support in scotland 
there does seem to be a fairly stronger feeling of nationalism 
again rosie said i think scots have a pendulum consciousness 
that swings from feeling british to feeling scottish and in my 
opinion its swinging toward scottishness now

emperor hirohito lost a large amount of blood early 
today but was in stable condition after being given emergency blood 
transfusions palace officials said 
doctors gave the frail 87yearold monarch a total of 13 pints 
of blood overnight to compensate for the bleeding the officials 
said it was the largest amount of blood the emperor has lost since 
he discharged close to 21 pints from his bowels on oct 1 news 
reports said 
iwao miyao vice grand steward of the imperial household agency 
said there had been no new discharge as of this afternoon but 
doctors were ready to administer more blood at any time 
hirohito has been in serious condition since sept 19 when his 
internal bleeding thought to be coming from his upper intestine 
caused him to vomit a large amount of blood 
doctors believe the discharge this morning came from blood that 
had accumulated over time from his internal hemorrhaging palace 
officials said 
palace spokesman kenji maeda told reporters the worlds oldest 
living monarch was in stable condition and fully conscious 
he said hirohito had eaten small amounts of porridge during the 
past four days the first food he has had since oct 1 doctors 
have been concerned about the emperors declining nutritional 
status caused by his intraveneous feeding which is unable to 
provide enough nutrients 
todays transfusions brought the total amount of blood hirohito 
has received since his condition worsened to 198 pints reportedly 
about twice the total amount of blood in his body 
the emperor underwent an intestinal bypass operation a year ago 
after an enlarged pancreas put pressure on his intestine blocking 
the passage of food imperial household officials said then he was 
suffering from chronic pancreatitis and no signs of pancreatic 
cancer were found

gunmen wearing militarystyle uniforms 
shot and stabbed six people to death in eastern sri lanka an army

the official who cannot be identified under briefing rules 
said four tamil and two sinhalese men were shot and stabbed late 
monday in the village of seyiliyamadu about 175 miles east of 
colombo the islands capital 
the official said the slayings could have been done by either 
militant tamils fighting for a separate nation in the northeastern 
province or extremist sinhalese opposed to the governments peace 
overtures to the tamil rebels 
tamils who are mostly hindu comprise 18 percent of the 
islands 16 million people militant tamils have been fighting 
since 1983 for an independent homeland in the northeast

tamils limited automony in the region and election of a provincial 
council is scheduled for nov 19 in exchange tamil rebels must 
surrender their weapons and end the fighting that has claimed at 
least 8500 lives 
the most militant group the liberation tigers of tamil ealam 
accepted the agreement after it was signed by india and sri lanka 
in july 1987 they reneged three months later saying it did not 
meet enough demands and india sent an estimated 47000 troops to 
the island to put down the rebellion 
radicals in the sinhalese community which makes up 75 percent 
of the islands population and controls the government also oppose 
the peace accord they claim it grants too many concessions to the 
tamils 
they have vowed to kill anyone who supports the agreement and 
have been blamed for more than 500 deaths in the past year 
including members of the governing united national party

us rep pat swindall likely heading to trial 
next week on federal perjury charges said he will resign from 
office if he is convicted but expressed confidence he would be 
exonerated 
a federal grand jury on monday indicted the twoterm republican 
on 10 counts of perjury saying he lied during a money laundering 
investigation he pleaded innocent and was freed on his 
recognizance 
swindall who will represent himself moved quickly to schedule 
his trial next week so the case could be resolved before the nov 8 
election 
us district judge robert l vining said he would reschedule 
another trial to hear the swindall case monday if the congressman 
filed the appropriate motion 
swindall is seeking his third term representing a suburban 
atlanta district and he vowed to clear himself before the election 
but he said he would resign if convicted because under the 
circumstances i dont think it would be fair to the voters of the 
4th district to remain in office 
his democratic opponent former dukes of hazzard television 
actor ben jones said i feel concern for the congressman and for 
his family at this point it is a matter for the courts to 
decide 
the indictment accused swindall of lying to the grand jury feb 
2 during its investigation of a proposed 850000 home mortgage 
loan the congressman had discussed with businessman charles 
lechasney and an undercover agent posing as a financier 
lechasney and four others have been charged with money 
laundering 
the indictment charged that swindall lied when he told the panel 
he did not go to authorities to report the loan negotiations 
because i never satisfied myself of anything with respect to 
criminality 
it also said he lied when he said there had never been 
discussions about trying to conceal the trail of the money and 
when he denied having been specifically informed by the undercover 
agent that the source of the loan could be illicit drug money 
if convicted swindall could be sentenced to five years in 
prison and fined 10000 on each count us attorney robert barr 
said 
swindall has acknowledged an error in judgment in dealing with 
lechasney but denied criminal wrongdoing and characterized any 
questionable statements to the jury as a memory lapse 
the congressman who is an attorney decried what he claimed 
were political overtones to the case 
this is a political lunch this is a political case it will 
be a political trial itll be a political exoneration he said 
barr also a republican said the case wasnt politically 
motivated 
vining had been scheduled to hear the trial of lechasney and 
another defendant monday and his willingness to delay that case to 
speed up swindalls trial was criticized by lechasneys attorney 
paul kish 
kish said he may consider ending negotiations on a plea 
agreement under which lechasney would cooperate with prosecutors 
there was no hurry in this case when my client sat in the 
douglas county jail for three weeks the lawyer said all of a 
sudden everyones falling all over themselves to get a defendant 
to trial as long as its a congressman of the same political party 
as the us attorney especially right before an election 
swindall who defeated jones in 1986 this year has made an 
issue of jones arrest record including a conviction for 
assaulting his wife jones has said the incidents occurred during a 
bout with alcoholism that ended in 1977 
jones who starred as cooter in the longrunning series 
the dukes of hazzard once suggested that swindall submit to 
drug tests insinuating the congressmans behavior was unstable

china has withdrawn permission for outspoken 
dissident fang lizhi to visit the united states and accused him of 
spreading falsehoods about chinese leaders fang said today 
fang an astrophysicist at the beijing observatory denied the 
accusations and said he was reapplying for permission 
the chinese academy of sciences gave fang permission in may to 
attend a symposium in texas starting dec 12 and spend six months 
at the colorado joint institute for laboratory astrophysics 
but he told the associated press today that the academy had sent 
him a letter reversing its decision 
the letter said relevant leaders were dissatisfied with 
comments fang made during a recent trip to australia and hong kong 
he said he spent three weeks in australia in august and september 
on an academic visit and spent a week in hong kong on his way back 
fangs wife li shuxian said the letter also accused fang of 
spreading rumors and said he should have gotten academy approval 
for the stop in hong kong 
fang said he wrote to the academy denying its accusations and 
reapplying to go 
whether leaders are happy or not should not affect normal 
scientific exchanges li quoted him as saying in the letter 
fang confirmed that in an informal meeting with chinese students 
in australia he mentioned rumors that many chinese leaders and 
their children maintain foreign bank accounts 
the official chinese news agency xinhua challenged fang to 
defend his comments when he arrived in hong kong 
but fang said the rumors are very common even among the 
students i talked to in australia and that he made no public 
accusations against officials 
he said all his comments abroad were permitted under the chinese 
constitution and denied hong kong press reports that he derided 
the chinese governments four basic principles socialism 
leadership by the communist party the dictatorship of the 
proletariat and marxismleninismmao tsetung thought 
however fang said he stands by his comments both in china and 
abroad criticizing marxism and oneparty rule 
everything has a beginning and an end even the ideology of 
the communist party says that it the party will come to an end 
fang said 
fang became famous in china in 1986 after supporting democracy 
in speeches to students at the university of science and technology 
in hefei in central china authorities said his speeches helped 
incite students in hefei and at major cities nationwide to join 
prodemocracy demonstrations that were suppressed in early 1987 
fang was expelled from the communist party shortly later and 
forced to resign as vice president of the university of science and 
technology

the letter according to the times said aipac did not represent 
the consensus of the organized jewish community on important 
middle east issues 
the six said they disagreed with aipacs opposition to arms 
sales to kuwait its efforts to shut down the palestine liberation 
organizations united nations mission and its effort to deny plo 
leader yasser arafat a visa to address the united nations the 
newspaper reported 
the letter says that the three organizations have established 
a joint political committee for israel in washington to arrange 
for the presentation of their testimony before congressional 
committees and government agencies the times said 
abraham h foxman national director of the adl said late 
monday i think the letter is a desire on our part to better the 
relationship between aipac and the three agencies the working 
relationship with aipac is good but we want it to be somewhat 
better 
he noted that the three organizations which have headquarters 
in new york already maintain offices in washington so it was not 
as if they were setting up anything new it is not their 
intention he added to set up as a competing group or to 
duplicate what aipac does 
the three groups already are represented on aipacs executive 
committee a policymaking body of about 150 people that meets four 
times a year 
a senior aipac officer quoted anonymously told the times more 
consultation is always desirable but the establishment of a second 
lobbying entity would undermine the effectiveness of the proisrael 
community in presenting its case to public officials in washington 
and elsewhere

this community was in shock over 
the suicides of two 15yearold boys who police said shared a 
hunting rifle to kill themselves out of despondency at being 
separated when one of their families moved away 
south milwaukee high school principal norman s klein tried to 
prepare teachers and staff members to deal with student suicide 
threats and attempts staging a simulation suicide exercise two 
weeks ago to rehearse a proper response 
even though we were prepared it was a shock said klein 
53 a principal 12 years 
the bodies of michael j kruczkowski of south milwaukee and 
william a bollis who recently moved with his family 70 miles 
north to malone were found by kruczkowskis mother in the attic of 
their home sunday evening 
they were best of friends and they had been separated 
police chief erick a slamka said the kid from up north had come 
down to visit for the weekend and it was when the father came to 
pick him up that the bodies were discovered 
evidence showed both boys died from a single shot to the head 
and the wounds appeared to be selfinflicted slamka said 
kruczkowski shot himself first police said 
according to the medical examiners report the boys left two 
printed notes addressed to their parents 
one note said they decided to end their lives because they could 
no longer be separated from their friends and each other the 
report said the second note instructed the parents to listen to a 
tape recording that explained the decision it said 
police declined to release the words of the notes or tape which 
slamka said ran no more than a minute 
this wasnt spontaneous slamka said it was planned 
though im not sure how long it was preplanned 
the bodies were discovered after bollis father came to the home 
and met kruczkowskis mother she went to the attic of the 
woodframe house where her son lived with his father and found 
the bodies slamka said kruczkowskis parents are divorced 
the 3006caliber rifle was owned by the kruczkowskis father 
who also had other rifles in the home 
there was no evidence that the boys had used drugs or alcohol 
the chief said in fact im not aware of any problems with the 
two of them 
slamka said he could not recall another case of a multiple 
suicide in his 25 years on the force 
from time to time we have gunshot suicides and young people 
are involved he said each time its especially tragic and in 
the event of a double suicide it multiplies the loss and the 
concern you have for these people 
early monday slamka sent his school liaison officer to the high 
school to meet with the principal the deaths were announced over 
the public address system and students were told counselors were 
available to help them 
similar steps were taken at new holstein high school in calumet 
county about 70 miles north of milwaukee where bollis was a 
student officials said 
tim schwaller a social worker for the south milwaukee school 
district said the guidance counselor office was hopping all 
morning with students wishing to talk about the deaths teachers 
were told about the shootings and were urged to be open with 
students should they ask what happened he said 
klein also had to inform students monday of the death of a math 
teacher dale parkinson 44 from a heart attack saturday 
funeral services were scheduled for kruczkowski on wednesday 
evening and for bollis on thursday

three escaped detainees 
encamped in the us consulate for more than a month plan to leave 
their sanctuary wednesday an antiapartheid labor federation said 
today 
the three prominent activists who escaped detention sept 13 
have been living in the consulate on the 11th floor of a downtown 
johannesburg office building 
the south african government has said the trio is free to leave 
and it will not redetain or restrict the men in any way 
the decision for the men to leave is a major test of the 
governments undertaking and will once again bring the spotlight on 
the detention and persecution of antiapartheid activists the 
congress of south african trade unions said in a staement 
the congress is the countrys largest black labor organization 
and is a militant opponent of apartheid 
the antiapartheid leaders are murphy morobe and mohanned valli 
moosa leaders of the banned united democratic front coalition and 
vusi khanyile chairman of the banned national education crisis 
committee 
morobe and khanyile are black valli moosa is of indian descent 
all had been held more than a year without charge when they 
slipped away from guards while undergoing physiotherapy at a 
johannesburg hospital 
the three have called the states bluff and intend to leave 
the congress statement said 
we do not for a moment believe that the government intended 
releasing them and that they somehow preempted this by their 
escape it added this government line was meant to appease the 
us administration and dilute public and international concern 
over detentions 
us officials have said they would not force the three to leave 
despite a worldwide us policy of not allowing diplomatic offices 
to be used by those seeking asylum 
us officials have maintained a low profile during the episode 
and us embassy spokesman william zavis said he had no immediate 
comment on the matter 
earlier the activists had said they do not trust the government 
and repeated their call for the release of other political 
detainees 
an estimated 30000 people have been detained without trial for 
varying lengths of time under the 28monthold state of emergency 
about 1000 people currently are believed to be in detention most 
are being held for political activism 
an activist who escaped sept 21 to the us consulate clifford 
ngcobo left the refuge earlier to obtain medical treatment his 
law firm said 
by law and custom apartheid establishes a racially segregated 
society in which the 26 million blacks have no vote in national 
affairs the 5 million whites control the economy and maintain 
separate districts schools and health services

vana lacost says her customers can get 
the great pumpkin but theyll have to shop early drought has 
reduced the number of jumbo jackolanterns in her eightacre patch 
as in other areas of the midwest 
the decorative pumpkin crop is short and people in the 
midwest will be paying more than usual for large pumpkins said 
j m gerber a pumpkin specialist at the university of illinois 
the problem area is as wide as the drought 
pumpkin growers in the east have a good crop but shipping them 
to the midwest is expensive and adds to the price gerber said 
decorative pumpkins are grown on smaller plots usually near 
urban areas and because farmers often cannot afford to irrigate 
the drought can cause significant damage 
this year seed failed to germinate in the sunbaked midwestern 
soil and vines that did grow either failed to produce as many 
pumpkins or produced smaller fruit than in previous years 
gerber said many growers in the midwest realized their crop 
would be smaller when the vines started dying and uncovering the 
fruit 
it will be the late shopper who has problems the last week 
before halloween could be tight mrs lacost whose farm is near 
kankakee predicted monday 
she said she has kept pace with demand so far and the quality of 
her pumpkins is good but the drought cut her volume in half she 
would not specify her prices but said they are a little higher 
than last year 
consumers wont have to worry about a shortage of canned 
pumpkins for holiday pies say officials in illinois which leads 
the country with about 5000 acres of the commercially canned 
product 
we had a super year said jack rohrs plant manager for the 
libby division of carnation co 
libby processes about 100000 tons of pumpkins a year at its 
morton plant rohrs said the size of the pumpkins was smaller than 
usual but the amount of fruit available was excellent 
he said libbys variety was deeprooted and survived the summer 
drought well however about 40 percent of libbys growers use 
irrigation 
our pumpkins were the best they ever were said lewis 
friedrich a tazewell county farmer who raises 180 acres of 
pumpkins for libby on irrigated land he said his yields ranged 
from 33 tons per acre to nearly 41 tons per acre and libby paid 
17 a ton for the crop

the chairman of a group that wants english to be 
the nations official language says he resigned to let voters focus 
on the issue instead of on allegations about his ties to advocates 
of forced sterilization 
the controversy has come to center more around me in the last 
week or 10 days john tanton said monday he said his resignation 
from us english which he cofounded would give him time to 
fight accusations 
his decision followed announcements by former white house aide 
linda chavez and retired cbs newsman walter cronkite that they were 
severing their ties with the organization 
ms chavez said monday she was quitting because she had been 
told that some major contributors to tantons other interests 
advocated unusual views on population and immigration control 
including advocacy of forced sterilization 
to me it is just not consistent with the views i hold she 
said 
cronkite resigned from the advisory board to us english on 
oct 6 after learning of a 2yearold tanton memo 
that memo distributed at a 1986 immigration conference posed a 
series of questions and depicted an america possibly doomed to 
conflict between a minority of educated welloff english speakers 
and a majority of uneducated poor people of other ethnic and racial 
groups with faster population growth 
tanton on monday described the memo as a compilation of 
questions and views of many observers on complex and controversial 
issues 
our opponents have falsely charged that it reflects the views 
of myself or us english and its positions on these initiatives 
he added there is no connection between a memo i wrote in 1986 
and the initiatives for the ballot in november 1988 
us english backs measures in arizona colorado and florida 
next month 
arizonas proposition 106 if approved would change the state 
constitution to designate english as the states official language 
and limit government use of foreign languages in courts meetings 
and schools 
ms chavez said at least one major contributor to us english 
helped reprint an awful awful book called camp of the 
saints which she described as a paranoid fantasy about 
undesirables of the third world taking over developed nations 
she said she had been told that tantons activities with 
immigration and populationcontrol groups involved some who may 
have given money to groups that may be involved in eugenics 
research 
she said one person favored forced sterilization but she did not 
elaborate 
tanton said he did not know who the people chavez was talking 
about 
us english gets most of its funds from us inc a michigan 
corporation run by tanton tantons wife and two michigan men 
records show us inc gets most of its funds from directmail 
solicitation but do not identify the contributors 
we have never had any sort of a litmus test when somebody has 
wanted to contribute tanton said in an interview adding that 
us inc had 168000 donors this year and 379000 since it was 
founded 
he said he would continue to head us inc as an incubator 
for new ideas and that us english had been given mailing lists 
and would be able to operate independently 
supporters of proposition 106 say it would unify the state and 
help minorities join the mainstream more quickly critics say it 
would disrupt the operation of civil courts englishproficiency 
classes and tourism and commerce with other countries 
us english through its campaignfinance arm has contributed 
160603 or about 97 percent of total contributions in support of 
prop 106 according to the latest available records 
bill meek a spokesman for the arizona opponents of prop 106 
said he viewed the tanton resignation as largely cosmetic 
because tanton retained control of us inc and because he was 
being replaced as chairman of us english by board member stanley 
diamond of san francisco one of his strongest supporters 
us english was founded in 1983 by tanton and former sen si 
hayakawa rcalif

federal investigators are looking into the 
affairs of 40 banks across the country and expect to turn up a 
couple more that have engaged in money laundering for drug 
dealers customs commissioner william von raab said today 
its just amazing what happens when you turn over a rock as 
big as this von raab said on nbctvs today show 
weve got our agents in 40 banks around the country as well 
as this bank in miami there are british agents in london french 
agents in paris and theres just voluminous material all of which 
is more or less bearing out what we expected to find he said 
we expect to see a lot of indictments coming out of this he 
said 
the indictment last week of a bank holding company has not 
halted such money handling von raab said were looking at as 
much as 50 billion a year that is laundered overseas so this 
bank at best could have laundered only a hundredth of that 
we havent put a stop to it yet he said but the indictment 
of the floridabased bank of credit and commerce international is 
a very important part of a cure 
no doubt there are other banks like this von raab went on 
there is 50 billion that someone has to launder one bank cant 
do the job as to whether there are other banks that know theyre 
doing this and are doing it intentionally i really cant give you 
that answer 
weve got a lot of investigations well probably turn up a 
couple 
the charge in this case is that the bank knew what it was doing 
that it knew it was dealing with drug money and that it was 
intentionally laundering the proceeds he explained 
why would a bank do that he was asked 
banks want the money he observed 
altogether 85 defendants have been indicted in the 
investigation indictments were returned in tampa fla new york 
chicago detroit philadelphia and houston in addition arrest 
warrants were issued in miami los angeles london and paris in the 
case involving the laundering of money for the powerful colombian 
drug cartel 
money laundering is the process of transferring money obtained 
illegally between businesses or banks in order to obscure its 
origin and to make it appear to have been earned in a legal manner

when the grayhaired aristocratic texan stood 
before the black political activists in the california state 
capitol they could not have been prepared for what followed 
lloyd bentsen the democratic vice presidential nominee was 
funny 
im one of only two folks in this crowd who knows where 
mineola texas is he said referring to the native town of 
california assembly speaker willie brown who had given him a warm 
introduction at the session last week willie is one of my few 
friends who has an office larger than his home town 
he joked about the flashy browns penchant for ferraris and fast 
driving then in another joke he neatly summed up his predicament 
willie brown thinks im a little pause dull he 
said the problem ive got with mike dukakis he thinks im too 
flamboyant 
thats the way it is when youre running for vice president 
he said 
the texas democrat at age 67 seems to have found stride even 
as the democratic campaign appears to sink he campaigns with 
increasing confidence and humor 
in the nearly two weeks since he bested republican dan quayle in 
their debate bentsen has acquired a smoother delivery and it 
seems new respect from the electorate everywhere he goes people 
ask him how would he like to be the head of the ticket 
bentsen who once failed miserably in seeking the presidency 
himself 12 years ago now just chuckles 
weve got a very able man at the head of that ticket and im 
delighted to be on it with him he said in an interview monday 
hes tough hes intelligent he has complete integrity and hes 
a proven product with the fine job hes done in the state of 
massachusetts 
if bentsen has any doubts about dukakis he keeps them under 
wraps but he has learned the frustration of being the second half 
of a presidential ticket he sees it every day in the polls polls 
that show his own popularity superb but the democrats losing his 
native texas by a doubledigit margin 
bentsen stubbornly insists he and dukakis will manage to carry 
the lone star state 
texas is still a major priority im going to spend a great 
deal of time down there michael dukakis is scheduled back into 
texas it stays a high priority he said 
but in texas and elsewhere bentsen is like a 300 hitter on a 
team with a pitcher who cant throw strikes as his career winds 
down political fans speak well of his candidacy but he cant 
bring home the pennant 
dukakis often points to bentsen as an example of his leadership 
comparing his choice to bushs selection of dan quayle but 
bentsens campaign schedule concocted by the governors aides in 
massachusetts seems like an afterthought with many 
hastilythrowntogether and poorly executed events 
last friday he spent nine hours in the air so he could 
introduce dukakis at a rally in sacramento 
he saw the biggest crowds of the campaign when he rode in a 
parade at a navajo reservation in northwest new mexico tens of 
thousands of people lined the route near shiprock but reporters 
walking alongside him heard the same question all along the route 
who is he the campaign had neglected to hand out leaflets to 
the crowd before he came 
last saturday night bentsen visited an ethnic area of brooklyn 
and spoke to supporters mostly greek fans of dukakis in a church 
hall even his own staff was puzzled by the stop 
out of those 600 people there were probably two undecideds 
quipped one top aide 
bentsen himself refrains from criticizing dukakis directly he 
has grumbled about the governor being too slow to respond to the 
attacks from the bush campaign and hints he would have answered 
key questions in the last dukakisbush debate differently 
im not going to try to second guess him he said 
emphasizing that the campaign had to focus on the three weeks ahead 
he wont say what advice hes given dukakis only that some has 
been taken and some has been rejected clearly his stance is an 
aggressive one 
down in my country politics is a contact sport hes fond 
of saying 
but as bentsen was leaving that black political meeting in the 
statehouse in sacramento he was almost wistful as he wished them 
well and bid them adieu 
im going back on the road he told willie brown and ill 
write if i find work

laborers working roundtheclock today 
finished piecing together a statue of gen douglas macarthur four 
days after vandals blasted it with dynamite 
world war ii veterans have arrived in this coastal village on 
leyte island for a ceremony thursday marking the day when the 
american general led us troops in liberating the philippines from 
japan on oct 20 1944 
the americans landed on leyte about 300 miles southeast of 
manila the island is among the poorest in the philippines and 
communist guerrillas have been active in the region for years 
police said today they believe the blast may have been the work 
of vandals under the influence of alcohol or narcotics but they 
added that they were not ruling out communist rebels as suspects 
damage was so extensive that the reconstructed concrete figure 
of the general has an disproportionately large left shoulder 
giving it the appearance of tipping over the quick repair job also 
eliminated the imperial air of the late american fourstar general 
depicted by the original sculpture 
workers reinforced the steel frame of the 10foot statue to 
minimize damage in case of a second attack 
the statue shows macarthur flanked by filipinos and american 
soldiers wading ashore on leyte 
i think the vandalism was immoral said alfredo 
mescallado 75 a naturalized american of filipino descent maybe 
the vandals didnt know that macarthur liberated the philippines 
they dont know their history 
mescallado a doctor from new york city served under macarthur 
during world war ii 
sandy valerio 64 an italianborn american from new york said 
communist new peoples army guerrillas may have attacked the statue 
to protest the american military presence in the philippines 
i dont feel anything bad about the blasting valerio 
added everybody has his own ideology 
dozens of former japanese soldiers visited the site today most 
of them posing for photographs in front of macarthurs statue

firefighters battling blazes that charred 
nearly 6000 acres of brush said they were confident the flames 
would not burn a shelter for exotic animals or burn the area around 
giant trees in sequoia national park 
barring sudden gusts the 3300acre fire northwest of los 
angeles did not present a threat to the wildlife way station or a 
home for 125 emotionally disturbed children said us forest 
service spokeswoman kim vanderhaar 
the flames were 1 miles away from the animal shelter and about 
3 miles beyond the home for children in little tujunga canyon she 
said 
officials at the wild animal shelter were cautious but confident 
all the animals are confined because we cant guard a 
freeroaming animal very well said martine colette spokeswoman 
for the animal shelter about 30 miles northwest of downtown los 
angeles 
the shelter houses alligators tigers bears horses giraffes 
and a variety of other abandoned exotic pets and wild animals that 
wandered into neighborhoods 
the fire in the angeles national forest which was 30 percent 
contained as of early today forced evacuations of seven homes 
two firefighters suffered minor injuries while battling the 
blaze which officials estimated will be surrounded at 6 pm 
wednesday and extinguished 24 hours later 
more than 800 firefighters were aided by nine air tankers and 
three helicopters that began dropping water and fireretardant 
chemicals at dawn monday as the blaze burned dry brush in 
inaccessible mountainous terrain 
three los angeles men were booked on 2500 bail for 
investigation of starting a forest fire with an illegal campfire 
but they were released monday and no charges were to be filed said 
deputy hal grant of the sheriffs information bureau 
it appears a 10yearold boy has admitted to it grant said 
he told arson investigators he started a campfire that got out of 
control 
the fire was one of several including a 1500acre fire near 
trees up to 2700 years old in sequoia national park that erupted 
during the weekend as an autumn heat wave blasted california with 
temperatures near 100 degrees in some areas and sent dry desert 
winds gusting to 30 mph 
in sequoia 600 firefighters worked to make sure the fires kept 
away from the 3squaremile giant forest a grove of trees 
considered the largest living things on earth said forest service 
spokeswoman michele case the fire was burning away from the trees 
as of today she said 
the trees can generally survive forest fires because their soft 
bark can withstand considerable heat and flame although a 
sequoia tree is fireresistant not fireproof case said 
elsewhere in california other blazes consumed about 1300 acres 
of brush

world jewish congress president edgar m bronfman 
today indicated communist east germany will pay reparations to 
holocaust victims and their families 
he also said he hoped for improved contacts between east germany 
and israel the two countries never have had diplomatic relations 
i have been given the understanding that serious consideration 
is being given to some renewal of relationship between the two 
countries and i hope that will happen in the nottoodistant 
future bronfman said 
before his meeting tuesday with east german leader erich 
honecker bronfman said he expected his threeday visit to east 
berlin would lead to a reparations agreement for jewish victims 
east germany had said it would provide unspecified humanitarian aid 
to holocaust victims 
at a news conference in east berlin at the end of his trip 
bronfman declined to be specific on exactly what compensation he 
expects 
i have had very good clear meetings here bronfman said 
i am totally satisfied on two counts the first is the one 
that concerns me the most that is the moral position that east 
germany is taking on its responsibilities on the holocaust the 
second point is payment to the sufferers and survivors 
bronfman also referred to an international claims conference 
backed by the world jewish congress that has handled reparations 
issues for holocaust victims 
i understand that the negotiations that took place between the 
government and claims conference have been completed he said 
they will be lived up to and the details and communications will 
be worked out and reported 
i am completely satisifed with the results bronfman added 
i have nothing further to say on the payments question it is not 
my responsibility to discuss the details 
toward the end of the news conference a reporter called out a 
question about west german jewish leaders statements that east 
germany would pay up to 100 million to holocaust victims 
the 100 million was not part of my mission bronfman 
responded 
there was no immediate statement on the reparations issue from 
the official east german news agency adn the news agency has been 
providing extensive coverage of bronfmans visit 
adn said monday the talks were open and constructive and 
added that honecker told bronfman of east germanys efforts to 
educate its young people about the holocaust 
the struggle against racism and antisemitism belongs to the 
antifascist tradition of east germany honecker said monday 
we will never forget that many jews together with communists 
and social democrats were active in the struggle against the 
nazi dictatorship honecker said according to adn 
bronfman has said that an admission of shared responsibility for 
the holocaust was as important as financial contributions to 
victims and that the money was a token thing 
what is at stake here is moral culpability he said 
more than 6 million jews were killed during adolf hitlers third 
reich however east germany has argued that it bears no 
reponsibility for nazi atrocities because the nation was created 
after world war ii ended 
in 1952 west germany signed an agreement with the world jewish 
congress to compensate holocaust victims and families since then 
west germany has paid more than 48 billion to holocaust survivors

lastminute objections scuttled a 
proposed settlement on how to distribute henry ford iis 350 
million estate meaning heirs may have to go to trial 
the settlement had appeared a certainty when opposing parties 
arrived at palm beach county circuit court on monday 
but attorneys for fords grandchildren who wont benefit from 
the trust until after the death of fords 48yearold widow raised 
objections 
ive heard enough judge vaughn rudnick said after listening 
to several of the more than a dozen attorneys unravel the deal i 
cannot approve an agreement at this date 
unless a new agreement is reached there will have to be more 
hearings and possibly a trial that the privacyconscious family has 
been trying to avoid 
were back to square a said robert montgomery one of four 
attorneys representing the widow kathleen duross ford she is to 
receive at least 15 million a year under the terms of her 
husbands vast trust which is at the center of the squabbling 
only minutes before the settlement breakdown montgomery had 
been holding an impromptu news conference in which he said the 
bitter disagreements aired in the court file and at a hearing in 
august had been resolved 
everyone is happy now everyone has signed the settlement 
agreement attirbetls said by settling the workings of the trust 
could once again become a private matter as henry ford ii had 
wished it would be 
ford died at age 70 on sept 29 1987 in detroit he filed his 
will which contained little information in palm beach county 
which was his legal residence 
the attorneys would reveal little of the settlement agreement 
beyond saying that mrs ford fords third wife would withdraw her 
objections to investor william donaldsons becoming a trustee 
the dispute erupted when mrs ford objected to the selection of 
donaldson a former undersecretary of state as a trustee to help 
manage the vast estate she had argued that his proposed 1 million 
a year fee for management expertise was excessive attorneys would 
not say how much he would be paid if the settlement is approved

the president today warned of 
great danger for the country if communist party leaders do not 
stop arguing over ethnic and social unrest that have stirred up 
yugoslavias worst postwar crisis 
leaders from the countrys two largest republics serbia and 
croatia clashed openly as the partys 162member central committee 
met today for a second day to discuss personnel and policy changes 
the way out of the crisis is not in extraordinary measures but 
in a change of behavior president raif dizdarevic told the 
session referring to unspecified actions he threatened to take 
last week if workers continued to stage mass rallies fueled by 
economic and ethnic problems 
the lack of unity in the leadership multiplying of late is a 
great danger for the country he added yugoslavia is 
frontpage news all around the world unfortunately in a negative 
way 
dizdarevic spoke to the countrys top leaders including 
communist party chief stipe suvar who planned to end the central 
committee session today with a vote of confidence in 10 members of 
the 23member ruling politburo 
josip vrhovec one of nine members of yugoslavias federal 
presidency attacked serbian party chief slobodan milosevic whose 
supporters have dominated the rallies 
using a statement milosevic allegedly made to an austrian 
weekly vrhovec who is from the republic of croatia demanded 
that milosevic use his influence to stop the denunciations of 
communist party leaders in the media and at the protests 
milosevic countered that he had never made the statement or 
given any interview to foreign media vrhovec apologized 
kosovos communist party leader katjusa jasari told the 
meeting the only way to solve the problems of her backward southern 
province was for the ethnic albanian majority to unite with the 
slav minority in confronting economic problems the slavs claim 
they are harassed by the ethnic albanians 
during mondays session suvar backed a marketoriented economic 
reform program being considered by parliament to fight the 217 
percent annual inflation rate and 21 billion foreign debt 
milosevic on monday launched an impassioned defense of the mass 
rallies that have fanned ethnic unrest and party disunity 
marko orlandic the party chief of the southern republic of 
montenegro said 10 members of the politburo are expected to face 
todays vote of confidence including party chief suvar orlandic 
said the 10 will need at least twothirds of the central committee 
votes to retain their seats on the ruling body 
the confidence vote will be conducted by secret ballot he said 
it will not apply to the four presidium members who announced 
prior to the current central committee that they would resign he 
said 
it also does not apply to nine members of the 23man ruling body 
who hold their seats as party leaders of yugoslaviaa six republics 
and two provinces and the armed forces 
milosevic who has antagonized nonserbs is among those exempt 
from the vote of confidence 
milosevic is trying to extend serbian control over his 
republics two autonomous provinces of vojvodina and kosovo 
but milosevic insisted monday that serbia has no claims to the 
territory of other republics it does have claim to territory in 
its own republic 
milosevics drive has brought him into unprecedented open 
conflict with suvar and the communist party chief of the northern 
republic of slovenia milan kucan the three men are yugoslavias 
most important communist leaders 
on monday kucan lent unreserved support to suvars appeal for 
unity and economic reform to ease social tensions 
the economic reform program has been worked out by the 
government under premier branko mikulic who survived a vote of 
confidence in may but came under severe criticism monday for 
failing to control the economic crisis

a state judge dismissed a lawsuit against 
union carbide that sought 1 billion in damages for victims of the 
1984 toxic gas leak in bhopal india that killed more than 2000 
people 
state district judge gary sandersons onepage ruling monday 
said only that it was his opinion that a motion to dismiss the 
lawsuit should be granted sanderson had heard arguments to dismiss 
the lawsuit from union carbide on sept 28 
houston attorney benton musslewhite who filed the lawsuit in 
1985 and later amended it to include almost 2000 plaintiffs said 
he plans to appeal and he also will ask sanderson for more detail 
on his reasoning for rejecting the suit 
the only place these poor people can get justice is in 
beaumont texas musslewhite said 
the lawsuit claimed that a texas statute allows lawsuits over 
incidents that happened in foreign countries to be filed in state 
district courts 
attorney john bissell who represented union carbide in the 
case had argued that the case clearly should be tried in india 
the accident happened in india it was an indian subsidiary of 
union carbide all of the evidence is in india he said 
several federal lawsuits involving the accident which occurred 
when a cloud of toxic gas escaped from the union carbide chemical 
plant in bhopal have been consolidated and sent to an indian 
court others are pending in connecticut union carbides home 
state musslewhite said 
musslewhite said he filed the lawsuit in beaumont because texas 
has statutes allowing for punitive damages in such cases and has 
many potential jurors acquainted with the hazards of living near 
chemical plants

officials at the savannah river plutonium 
plant said an oversight was responsible for underreporting of 
the amount of radioactive contaminant released into a creek 
according to reports published today 
according to a sept 21 report by du pont which operates the 
plant a 375000gallon release on july 8 was contaminated by 17 
millicuries of cesium137 a waste byproduct known to cause cancer 
however officials continued to collect data through 
midseptember and those updated numbers werent in the report the 
augusta ga chronicle and the augusta herald reported in todays 
editions 
the sept 21 report obtained by the newspapers last week said 
the 17millicuries figure was based on data collected only through 
july 22 on monday du pont officials increased the figure to 26 
millicuries of cesium137 
a millicurie is onethousandth of a curie the unit used to 
measure radioactivity 
the report of an unusual occurrence at the plant was prepared 
july 25 and revised sept 16 the revisions should or could 
have included the change said plant spokesman clif webb it 
was an oversight the data was available but it was not used 
the change webb said did not make any difference in terms of 
public safety or health the report had to be completed within 
three weeks of the accident webb said adding it was later revised 
as additional information became available 
poorly trained personnel and inadequate procedures were blamed 
for the water being released into four mile creek which flows into 
the savannah river no abnormal levels of the waste byproduct were 
detected in the river according to du pont and south carolina 
environmental officials 
the shutdown since april of all three reactors at the plant for 
maintenance and testing has raised safety questions about the 
plant which du pont operates for the department of energy 
in another incident about 100 plant employees were evacuated 
monday afternoon when a fan malfunctioned in the 
plutoniumprocessing area but officials said the workers were not 
endangered 
the fan was restarted about 30 minutes later said webb the 
cause of the equipment failure was under investigation a backup 
fan normally would have been activated but the second unit was out 
of service for routine maintenance he said 
the exhaust fan is used to circulate fresh air through the 
building and to remove any releases of contamination from the 
building 
the amount of contamination would depend on how much plutonium 
was being processed when such an accident occurred officials will 
not discuss specifics on plutonium production

the minnesota court of appeals today 
ordered a youth to be tried as an adult on charges that he murdered 
four members of his family with an ax last february when he was 16 
the unanimous ruling by a threejudge panel reverses the 
decision last spring of district court judge gerard ring who said 
david brom should be tried as a juvenile 
brom who turned 17 on oct 3 faces four counts of firstdegree 
murder for the slayings of his parents bernard and paulette brom 
both 41 sister diane 13 and brother ricky 11 the family 
members were found slain in their home north of rochester on feb 
18 an older son who had moved out of the home earlier was not 
there when the slayings occurred 
brom a high school sophomore at the time of the slayings has 
been undergoing treatment at the oaks treatment center in austin 
texas a facility for severely disturbed children and adolescents 
psychiatrists at hearings earlier this year described him as 
severely depresssed 
if he had been tried as a juvenile and convicted he would be 
released on his 19th birthday if convicted in adult court he 
faces an automatic life sentence with eligibility for parole after 
17 years 
the brutal murders of these four family members has had a 
major impact on society the appeals court wrote retention of 
the alleged murderer within the criminal justice system for less 
than three years would constitute an excessively minimal response 
the appeals court disagreed with the trial courts contention 
that the state had failed to show that brom was not amenable to 
treatment or that the public safety was not served by retaining him 
in the juvenile court system

jesse jackson said today that michael dukakis has 
the support of black voters and can beat republican george bush in 
the nov 8 election if other democrats work as hard for the ticket 
as jackson has 
in an interview on cbs this morning jackson disputed any 
suggestion that he has not worked hard enough for dukakis the man 
who beat him for the democratic nomination at the partys atlanta 
convention in july 
the fact is since atlanta ive traveled more miles spoken to 
more people and registered more voters for this ticket than any 
democrat has jackson said 
what ought to happen now is that the other democratic team 
that made commitments in atlanta ought to pull their weight and 
together we can win he said 
jackson said he has campaigned more widely for the 
dukakisbentsen ticket than any governor or member of congress i 
now appeal to other democratic leaders in their congressional 
sphere in their state sphere to match that record he said 
we can win this campaign 
in the campaign in general he said my concern is that were 
missing issues of substance 
when dukakis proposed a national health care plan for the 37 
million americans who do not have medical insurance that needs 
more projecting he said 
when bush attacks dukakis over his membership in the american 
civil liberties union and on health insurance and civil rights 
issues jackson said we have both a challenge in mr bush and an 
opportunity in mr dukakis 
as for black support jackson said dukakis should be able to 
count on blacks because our civil rights are threatened he 
should be able to count on a broad crosssection of american 
people in my judgment he has earned it

maurice allais described as the man who shaped 
thinking about economics and the state in postwar france said 
today he had given up hoping he would win the nobel memorial prize 
for economic science 
ive been mentioned so many times before i just didnt think i 
would get it allais 77 said at his apartment in the suburb of 
st cloud 
colleagues said allais trained as an engineer changed fields 
to economics after a visit to the united states during the 
depression when he saw factories idled and men out of work 
my motivation when i was young was an idea of being able to 
improve the conditions of life to try to find a remedy to many of 
the problems facing the world allais told a group of reporters 
thats what led me into economics i saw it as a way of helping 
people 
allais was working at his home when he received the news he had 
won 
it was completely unexpected it was just mindboggling he 
said 
the royal swedish academy of sciences which awards the prize 
said allais was chosen for his pioneering contributions to the 
theory of markets and efficient utilization of resources 
although littleknown outside france allais was extremely 
influential at home where senior officials in key government 
ministries and stateowned industries have enormous economic power 
jacques levy director of the ecole nationale des mines from 
which allais officially retired nine years ago while continuing 
his research and writing said the new laureate had a decisive 
effect on economic thinking for more than two decades 
he was the mentor for everyone involved in the economy in 
postwar france between 1945 and 1968 all the people who were in 
charge of the biggest enterprises and of the state planning 
apparatus levy said 
within the world of french economic thought after world war ii 
in which leftists and rightists agreed the state should play a 
major role in the economy allais established a place for reliance 
on market forces 
he worked on a system of definition of prices which would 
permit the economy to function at its best levy said 
allaiss work provided a very strong base for those opposed to 
government direction of the economy said jacques lautman 
scientific director for human sciences at frances national center 
for scientific research 
allais said he hoped the nobel prize would allow him to continue 
his work even though he is past the official retirement age 
im happy to have the nobel prize to show how absurd this 
situation is he said its amazing that politicians think its 
normal that they should not retire while they think its normal to 
push scholars into retirement

the supreme court will determine whether 
states may make it a crime to burn the american flag as a symbolic 
protest with a potentially farreaching ruling on freedom of 
expression expected in 1989 
the justices announced monday that they will review a texas 
statute that bans desecration of the flag the case involves a 
demonstrator who was sentenced to prison for burning a flag in a 
protest during the 1984 republican national convention in dallas 
the texas branch of the american civil liberties union urged the 
justices not to review a ruling that permitted the flag burning 
the aclu said state officials were trying to create a sense of 
legal uncertainty where none exists 
while flagburning generally has not been a hot issue since the 
days of vietnam war protests the case may attract considerable 
attention because of the emphasis on patriotic values during the 
current presidential campaign 
vice president george bush the republican nominee has attacked 
his democratic opponent gov michael dukakis of massachusetts for 
vetoing a law requiring teachers to lead the pledge of allegiance 
in that states public schools dukakis vetoed the bill after 
receiving an advisory opinion from the massachusetts supreme court 
saying the measure was unconstitutional 
in the texas case a state appeals court last april threw out 
the flagburning conviction of gregory lee johnson who had been 
sentenced to one year in jail and fined 2000 
the supreme court agreed to consider reinstating johnsons 
conviction 
johnson was arrested on aug 22 1984 while participating in a 
demonstration against the reagan administration and the republicans 
the protest culminated with a rally in front of dallas city hall 
that included political chants and the flag burning 
johnson was convicted by a jury of violating a state law banning 
the desecration of a veneraed object 
the state appeals court said the act for which johnson was 
convicted was clearly speech contemplated by the first 
amendment 
the state court said the texas law against flag desecration is 
too broad because it seeks to curb expression likely to cause 
serious offense 
seriously offending someone is not the same as inciting to riot 
an activity that permits restraints on free speech the state 
court said 
it also rejected arguments by law enforcement officials that the 
antidesecration statute legitimately preserves the flag as a 
symbol of unity 
recognizing that the right to differ is the centerpiece of our 
first amendment freedoms a government cannot mandate by fiat a 
feeling of unity in its citizens the state court said 
in other action the supreme court 
agreed in a potentially important libel case to review a 
200000 award won against an ohio newspaper the justices will 
examine how closely appeals courts must scrutinize jury findings of 
actual malice when a public figure sues for libel 
said it will hear a reagan administration appeal aimed at 
making it easier for the government to conduct taxfraud 
investigations the court will use a california case involving the 
church of scientology to settle a dispute over internal revenue 
service powers 
let stand the espionage and theft convictions of former us 
intelligence analyst samuel loring morison for giving secret 
satellite photographs to a british magzine 
agreed in a case from ohio to decide whether states may give 
larger retirement benefits to public employees based on the age 
when they are forced to quit work

a priest who tried to negotiate an 
end to the twoweek standoff between five conservative nuns and 
their reformminded diocese has returned home with his mission 
unfulfilled 
one of the nuns sister john of the cross who has acted as a 
spokeswoman for the group said the nuns would not budge from their 
roman catholic monastery where they have locked themselves in the 
infirmary until they hear directly from the vatican 
we are all united here theres no division among the five 
she said in a telephone interview monday from the monastery of the 
most blessed virgin mary of mount carmel located about 30 miles 
west of new york city 
the rev kevin culligan dispatched by the vatican to try to 
persuade the nuns and the diocese of paterson to resolve their 
differences returned home to wisconsin on monday night 
the carmelite friar said he will submit a report to cardinal 
jerome hamer an official of the congregation for religious and 
secular institutes an arm of the vatican 
after receiving my report within the next several days the 
congregation in rome will make whatever decisions it judges 
appropriate culligan said in a statement 
the nuns members of the order of discalced carmelites oppose 
what they say are efforts by the monasterys new prioress mother 
teresa hewitt to modernize the order with the introduction of 
television candy and newspapers the order traditionally has 
stressed prayer and seclusion 
the prioress spoke briefly monday evening to reporters saying 
the protesting nuns would not cooperate with culligans efforts 
even though we are all very impressed at his fairness and 
sensitivity in handling the situation 
the sisters who received official dismissal warnings in june 
say they retreated to the infirmary fearing they would be evicted 
for their dissident views four locked themselves in the infirmary 
oct 4 and a fifth joined them a day later eight other nuns live 
at the monastery 
paterson diocese officials say the nuns had earlier agreed to 
leave they also say the dispute amounts to a lack of obedience by 
the nuns and that they could be relieved of their vows 
the group broke off talks with culligan on saturday when 
culligan refused to discuss whether paterson diocese officials were 
working to oust the nuns sister john said but two of the nuns met 
with him again on monday she said

philip morris cos incs 11 billion bid for 
kraft inc would make it the worlds largest maker of consumer 
goods while decreasing its heavy dependence on profitable but 
stagnating cigarette sales 
philip morris the 12th biggest industrial company in the 
fortune 500 launched a surprise tender offer late monday that 
would pay 90 a share to shareholders of 31stranked kraft 
if successful the deal would be the largest nonoil takeover 
ever trailing only standard oil cos 134 billion purchase of 
gulf corp in 1984 that company later changed its name to chevron 
corp 
in early trading today on the new york stock exchange kraft 
shot up 27 a share to 8737 just below the offer price while 
philip morris fell 512 to 9487 because of investors fears 
that the acquisition of kraft would dilute philip morriss 
earnings trading was heavy 
glenview illbased kraft indicated it might fight the 
takeover even though the offer was about 50 percent above its 
closing stock price on monday new yorkbased philip morris best 
known for marlboro virginia slims benson amp hedges and merit 
cigarettes took over general foods corp the maker of jello 
maxwell house koolaid shake n bake and oscar meyer in 1985 for 
57 billion 
the addition of kraft would bring such names as velveeta 
thousand island dressings cheez whiz breyers light n lively 
sealtest and frusen gladje 
philip morris is aiming for preeminence among consumer goods 
marketers and this will take them there said analyst john c 
bierbusse of ag edwards amp sons in st louis 
with kraft it would displace unilever the britishdutch 
company as the worlds largest maker of consumer goods 
philip morris revenues for the year that ended june 30 were 29 
billion and when added to krafts 105 billion for the period 
the revenues would far outstrip unilevers 30 billion according 
to jay h freedman an analyst who follows consumer producers for 
kidder peabody amp co 
in an interview late monday hamish maxwell philip morriss 
chairman and chief executive said being in the food business 
we feel that we understand it 
kraft and philip morriss general foods are roughly the same 
size and together would have roughly 20 billion in annual revenue 
that would make philip morris the biggest food company after nestle 
sa of switzerland which had revenue last year of 28 billion 
the cigarette business generates enormous amounts of cash for 
philip morris but its growth is slowing even though the company 
has been successful in increasing sales abroad particularly in 
developing countries 
tobacco will account for about 78 percent of its earnings this 
year compared with 16 percent for general foods and smaller 
amounts for miller brewing co and other units said bierbusse 
the dependence on cigarettes has frightened some investors from 
the stock analysts said 
maxwell said the cigarette business continues to grow in profit 
revenue physical volume and market share and has philip morriss 
strong support but he conceded i dont think most people would 
pick it as a big growth industry for the future 
were trying to build our business and were also trying to 
position it for the future and not just for the present or the 
past 
despite the 11 billion price the cigarette and food giant 
can well afford it said emanuel goldman an analyst with 
painewebber inc in san francisco their cash flow is 13 
billion a year thats 150000 an hour 24 hours a day 366 days 
a year 
john m richman kraft chairman and chief executive said its 
board will meet in due course to consider the offer 
he said the board previously concluded that the best longterm 
interest of our shareholders is that kraft continue to operate as 
an independent company 
krafts directors will make a recommendation on the tender offer 
by oct 31 richman said urging shareholders to hold onto their 
stock until then 
the offer took the stock market by surprise 
in consolidated new york stock exchange trading monday kraft 
stock rose 62 cents a share to 6012 philip morris stock rose 
137 a share to 100 trading volume in both stocks was roughly 
average 
complicating the takeover bid is a poison pill defense that 
kraft has erected to make unwanted takeovers difficult philip 
morris asked kraft to dismantle the shareholder rights plan and to 
back its request filed suit in federal district court in chicago 
seeking to force kraft to drop the defense 
last year philip morris had 374 billion in operating profit on

democrat michael dukakis striving to 
regain the initiative in the closing weeks of the presidential 
campaign pledged today that during his first four years as 
president well turn that trade deficit back into a trade 
surplus 
dukakis reminded his audience at western michigan university 
that wednesday is the first anniversary of oct 19 1987 stock 
market crash 
and remember why it happened he asked the trade deficit 
had soared republican policies of borrow and spend and borrow and 
spend had done the damage 
interest rates were going up to attract the foreign bankers we 
needed to buy our massive federal debt and the speculative bubble 
burst as it always does 
campaigning in the industrial midwest dukakis was fighting to 
overcome the impression that republican rival george bush was 
surging to an insurmountable lead and that their race was virtually 
over 
dukakis and his top aides disputed a new national poll which 
said bush has a 17point lead over the massachusetts governor 
campaign chairman paul brountas called reporters attention to 
another poll published in the boston herald which showed dukakis 
trailing bush by seven points 
in his kalamazoo speech dukakis stressed the differences he 
perceived between the vice president and himself 
george bush wants to help the people who already have it 
made he said i want to make every american a full shareholder 
in the american dream 
george bush cares about the people on easy street i care 
about the people on main street hes on their side im on your 
side 
the democratic nominee said that in the year since the stock 
market fell by 500 points neither bush nor the reagan 
administration had done anything to correct the underlying causes 
weve got to end the republican rainbow coalition of red ink 
for our children pink slips for our workers greenmail for sharp 
operators on wall street and golden parachutes for top corporate 
executives he said 
dukakis said that in its first four years the reagan 
administration turned two generations of trade surpluses into the 
worlds largest trade deficit and cost our workers 5 million jobs 
in the first four years of the dukakisbentsen administration 
well turn that trade deficit back into a trade surplus and reclaim 
those jobs for american workers he said 
thats our goal to eliminate the trade deficit in four 
years itll take hard work we have to reduce the budget deficit 
well do it 
monday night in columbus ohio dukakis told a predominantly 
black audience that the democrats have just three weeks to 21 days 
to mobilize our forces to reach out to our neighborhoods 
before the nov 8 election showdown 
earlier in the day dukakis learned of the new nbc newswall 
street journal survey giving bush a 17point lead and said this 
business of polls is really having a terrible effect on the 
campaign 
i can only tell you that there are other polls that say very 
different things about where we are and where the race is the 
democratic nominee said 
conceding that he is the underdog dukakis was campaigning in 
the industrial midwest telling voters that he would fight to 
create new jobs and describing bush as indifferent to the regions 
problems 
dukakis said bush sat on his hands while americas industrial 
heartland has been fighting for its life 
with only 21 days left in the long presidential campaign 
dukakis picked up the pace of his activity 
he was in ohio all day monday touring a plant on the edge of 
cleveland and then addressing workers visiting a bowling alley in 
dayton and meeting with local residents to discuss their problems 
with housing education and drugs then flying to columbus for 
another community meeting and then a speech at a rally 
at rallies he implored supporters to get out and do the 
precinct work he hopes will result in an upset on nov 8 
those phone calls you make the doors you knock on can make 
the difference he told them 
there was obvious concern among dukakis and his aides that his 
precinct workers will become discouraged by polls and by reports 
that he is trimming his efforts to the bare minimum of states that 
would provide the 270 electoral votes needed for election 
aides vehemently denied a report on sunday that he was 
concentrating on 18 states with 272 electoral votes 
but long gone was the memory of those days when national polls 
said dukakis was 17 points ahead of bush 
the new nbcjournal poll said 55 percent of the 1378 likely 
voters surveyed favored the republican vice president and 38 
percent backed dukakis 
the survey also said that 36 percent had a favorable opinion of 
dukakis down from 50 percent a month ago while 55 percent had a 
favorable opinion of bush up from 50 percent 
bushs held a commanding lead among men 6430 percent and a 
slight edge among women 4844 percent 
dukakis said the poll numbers had absolutely no relationship 
to anything that we have or other people have 
he said polling really drives the process to a degree and 
everybody is doing them

gov richard celeste said today he is asking 
president reagan to shut down a federally owned uranium porcessing 
plant until the government takes steps to ensure it no longer 
threatens the environment with radioactive pollution 
he said he is sending reagan a letter today demanding that the 
us department of energy which owns the plant provide for an 
independent evaluation of plant employees and area residents to 
assess the impact of its operation on their health 
referring to testimony last week about problems at the plant 
celeste said in the letter to reagan that this admission of 
deceit and mismanagement confirms and emphasizes what we have known 
in ohio for a long time this facility is an environmental disaster 
threatening the health and safety of thousands of ohioans 
appearing at an airport news conference celeste also demanded 
that the energy department treat and stabilize radioactive thorium 
to reduce the threat of fire that could spew the material into the 
atmosphere and begin a final cleanup of radioactive waste stored 
in two deteroirating concrete silos 
he also wants the department to start identifying the contents 
of 200000 containers of waste that has accumulated as a result of 
what the governor said is the departments negligent management of 
the 1050acre site about 18 miles northwest of here in fernald 
celeste noted testimony friday at a congressional committee 
hearing in washington which he said made it clear that the energy 
department has known of dangerous environmental problems at the 
feed materials production center since the plant opened they said 
they are concerned about more than three decades of radioactive 
emissions into the atmosphere around the plant and into thade progress 
at the plant 
with a decadelong cleanup costing more than 500 million 
the plant processes uranium for the nations production of 
nuclear weapons 
neighbors of the area around the plant fear that the plant 
already has polluted their land water and air 
in columbus democratic presidential nominee michael dukakis 
today met with two families who live near the plant and heard their 
concerns about the plants safety

republican vice presidential candidate 
dan quayle said today that the nov 8 election will mark an 
american turning point that only a george bush administration can 
navigate 
every one of these changes i have projected is going to 
happen said the indiana senator the question is not whether 
they happen but whether we will shape the world through them 
quayle spoke at eastern illinois university as he embarked on a 
daylong bus tour of downstate illinois he also crossed paths and 
spoke briefly with gop nominee bush who was headed for campaign 
appearances in missouri 
quayle aides said the two discussed foreign policy and 
scheduling for a few months and that quayle expressed the hope 
they could campaign together sometime 
demonstrators favoring and opposing bushs youthful running mate 
paraded noisily around the floor of the gymnasium where quayle 
spoke the gop forces cheered lustily when police officers formed a 
line in front of antiquayle protesters 
the day was described by campaign aides as full of controlled 
spontaneity with plans for folksy colorful stops at farms and 
schools as the bus caravan nicknamed the illini express made 
its way toward chicago on a cool and blustery fall day 
quayle was joined by illinois gov james thompson who himself 
was mentioned as a potential vice presidential running mate before 
the gop convention in new orleans last august 
quayle toured michigan all day monday telling audiences that 
us midwesterners have to stick together against that man from 
massachusetts 
while lambasting democrat michael dukakis quayle painted the 
gop ticket as a perfectly balanced one 
with george bush you get experience quayle said with me 
you get the future the future of america 
that was a theme he returned to throughout a day of campaigning 
in increasingly soggy weather and he expanded on it speaking with 
reporters on his campaign plane 
hopefully i have a few years left im only 41 quayle 
said thats something they voters will think about but i 
dont believe it will be a decisive factor they vote for the top 
of the ticket 
most polls have shown the gop ticket with a small but persistent 
lead in the polls and quayle said republicans need to guard 
against overconfidence 
were not the least bit overconfident because there are still 
three weeks left in this campaign he said 
quayle wrapped up his campaign day monday with outdoor events in 
a steady and cold drizzle and tried to turn that to his advantage 
dukakis his favorite colors are gray and dark gray quayle 
said what were having today is dukakis weather 
along the way quayle shrugged off a decision by the teamsters 
union to endorse bush while at the same time pointedly declining to 
back the indiana senator 
quayle insisted the endorsement is good news for me because 
the union is again backing a republican 
i hope that all the teamsters people who follow their 
endorsement rush out and vote quayle said its going to be 
important to have their votes the fact is im delighted they 
endorsed george bush 
other than hitting dukakis quayles focus of the day was 
economics he said republicans have solved a series of pressing 
economic woes falling short only on budget deficits 
we have on every one of those issues except for the budget 
deficit solved them in a very positive manner quayle said we 
will also meet the challenges of the budget deficit in the next 
administration

a federal panel recommended today that america 
get serious about ensuring the health of its newborn citizens if 
for no better reason than to save money 
noting that more than 3 is saved for every dollar spent on 
prenatal care the institute of medicine said government health 
officials federal and local should seek out pregnant women to 
make sure they get care they and their babies need early on rather 
than wait for frail and diseased infants to be born 
the committee to study outreach for prenatal care referred to a 
1985 institute study that calculated that each dollar spent on 
providing more adequate prenatal care to lowincome poorly 
educated women could reduce total expenditures for direct medical 
care of their low birthweight infants by 338 during the first 
year of life 
joyce c lashof chairman of the committee said at a news 
conference today that expanding medicaid to cover all poor 
pregnant women would cost an additional 875 million by 1993 
but the most important fact is we would be saving 3 for every 
dollar spent so what we really need to be doing is calculating the 
net savings she said 
using that formula the medicaid expansion should result in 
net savings of 25 billion she said 
george m ryan a committee member said he is very optimistic 
that improvements will be made in prenatal care programs because 
if anything gets attention its dollars and cents 
i just dont think this nation is going to go on taking care 
of handicapped infants when we can prevent the handicaps with 
proper prenatal care said ryan 
lashof is on the faculty of the school of public health at the 
university of california in berkeley and ryan is an obstetrics and 
gynecology professor at the university of tennessee medical school 
in memphis 
the survey said the health problems encountered by a significant 
portion of newborns includes a set of financial barriers ranging 
from problems in private insurance and medicaid to the complete 
absence of health insurance 
among its recommendations the committee called for the nation 
to adopt as a new social norm the principle that all pregnant 
women not only the affluent should be provided access to 
prenatal labor and delivery and postpartum services appropriate 
to their need 
recent federal legislation authorizes states to provide prenatal 
care under medicaid for families whose income is up to 185 percent 
of the federal poverty line or more than 15000 a year for a 
family of four however it is left to the states to decide whether 
to implement the option which would result in a oneforone match 
in federal dollars 
without referring to that new state option directly the iom 
survey said too often communities organize outreach to help 
women over and around major obstacles to care rather than removing 
the obstacles themselves to fund outreach in isolation and hope 
that it alone will accomplish major improvements in the use or 
prenatal services is naive and wasteful 
the panel concluded that the solution is action rather than more 
study 
the committee specifically urges that no more research be 
conducted to demonstrate the importance of financial and other 
institutional barriers to care the report said 
the committee recommends that the current practice of 
securing funds for services under the guise of research cease 
it said the president congress and other national leaders must 
commit themselves openly and unequivocally to designing a new 
maternity care system or systems dedicated to drawing all women 
into prenatal care and providing them with an appropriate array of 
health and social services throughout pregnancy childbirth and 
the postpartum period

bess myersons lawyer hammered at the star 
witness against the former miss america pointing out 
inconsistencies in her testimony and getting her to admit that she 
had received electroshock treatments that may have affected her 
memory 
the crossexamination of sukhreet gabel the daughter of the 
judge miss myerson is charged with trying to bribe began gently 
monday with the defense lawyer drawing a picture of ms gabel as a 
brilliant college student 
but the lawyer frederick hafetz soon had the witness visibly 
shaken and she did not disagree when he told her that electroshock 
treatments made your memory selective like a swiss cheese with 
holes in it 
repeatedly hafetz gave the jury examples of discrepancies that 
have appeared during the numerous times ms gabel has given 
testimony during an appearance before a grand jury during 
depositions to the prosecution and during the trial 
miss myerson 64 her boyfriend carl andy capasso 43 and 
former state judge hortense gabel are charged with a bribery 
conspiracy in which the younger ms gabel was given a city job in 
return for her mothers decision to slash capassos alimony and 
childsupport payments in a divorce case before her 
miss myerson was the commissioner of the citys department of 
cultural affairs ms gabel was hired in 1983 as her 19000ayear 
special assistant 
at one point during mondays crossexamination in manhattan 
federal court ms gabel said she could not remember what she had 
told a reporter on sunday or what she had testified during the 
previous week 
my memory for events that took place in 1983 is better than 
for some events that took place yesterday ms gabel said 
looking around the courtroom nervously ms gabel said she always 
testified to the best of my recollection 
earlier monday under questioning by one of the prosecutors 
assistant us attorney david lawrence ms gabel testified that 
during the time a grand jury was investigating the alleged dealings 
in 1986 miss myerson ordered her to keep quiet 
what bess said to me was listen im worried you know 
andys been before a grand jury she said 
she said weve got to get our stories straight the trouble 
with you is you remember too much youve got to learn to forget 
more ive forgotten more than youll ever know ms gabel 
testified 
however under crossexamination ms gabel admitted she was 
uncertain of the year she had had that alleged conversation with 
miss myerson and also said that she had a series of 15 electroshock 
treatments quite likely during one month in the spring of 1986 
ms gabel who now takes antidepressant drugs agreed with 
hafetz when he told the jury she had earlier testified that the 
shock treatments adversely affected her memory

a former member of ptls board of 
directors said today that jim bakker deserved every bonus he 
received while at the helm of the television ministry and religious 
theme park 
evelyn spencer testifying in ptls 52 million lawsuit against 
bakker his wife tammy and former top aide david taggart said 
she and other board members consistently voted unanimously in favor 
of bonuses for bakker 
if a bonus came up i voted for it said ms spencer pastor 
of the house of truth church in oakland calif 
according to irs figures presented in court today bakker 
received 278000 in salary in the fiscal year ending in may 1987 
plus 1167000 in bonuses 
under crossexamination ms spencer could not recall the 
precise salary of bakker while she was on the board from november 
1985 to march 1987 
bakker was expected to testify later today the trial began in 
bankruptcy court in september and was adjourned for about a month 
before resuming monday before us bankruptcy judge rufus reynolds 
in his opening statement monday bakker attorney ryan hovis told 
the court the case against the bakkers boiled down to allegations 
they mismanaged the ptl television ministry which went into 
bankruptcy three months after bakker resigned in march 1987 amid a 
sexandmoney scandal 
but hovis said he would show that the bakkers salaries were 
authorized by the ministrys board the benefits they enjoyed 
properly donated by the ministry and the cash advances they were 
given reimbursed 
salaries and benefits received by the ptl founders he said 
were not only legal and properly approved but also earned 
but because the ministrys records are now dispersed among other 
legal actions including bankruptcy court hovis said he may be 
unable to provide precise documentation 
a lot of the records are simply not available he said 
in a separate hearing monday morning on ptls bankruptcy case 
reynolds said he wants to see how the proposed sale of the ptl 
ministry shapes up before considering whether to liquidate the 
troubled television ministry and its heritage usa theme park near 
fort mill 
reynolds postponed until nov 16 consideration of several 
motions by creditors to move the ministry from chapter 11 
bankruptcy to chapter 7 if those motions are granted it would 
mean heritage usa and other ministry assets would be sold by an 
immediate auction rather than by an arranged sale 
the judge said at a hearing last month he would hear the motions 
to convert to chapter 7 if no buyer were found for heritage usa 
canadian businessman stephen mernick has since signed a contract 
with ptl trustee mc red benton to buy heritage usa for 115 
million

a 40yearold man and his five sons were rescued 
after drifting helplessly in the pacific for more than a month and 
he says hed like to go back and retrieve their 33foot sailboat 
we put everything we had into that boat sold everything even 
our furniture to buy it said clint fleishour of san diego who 
along with his sons was rescued late thursday by a navy tugboat 
weve been on the water a lot my older boys have experience 
sailing fleishour said id like to go back and get it 
but fleishour said he knew the familys safety was more 
important than their boat he said he had feared he would see his 
five sons die of starvation before they were rescued 
fleishour said he and his sons ignacio 17 martin 15 kazan 
13 clint jr 11 and rocky 8 spent 33 days adrift in their 
sailboat paloma before being rescued by the narragansett a navy 
tugboat operated by civilians 550 miles northeast of honolulu on 
thursday night 
they survived eight days without food and five without water he 
said 
my estimation is the kids would have lasted with no water 
no food approximately 10 days said david george second 
officer aboard the tugboat in my opinion the 8yearold should 
have passed away 
the youngest boy was not very responsive said george who 
doubles as a medical officer two of the five kids were spitting 
up blood and had some form of a perforated ulcer 
but none of the boys was hospitalized sunday after they reached 
honolulu where they stayed at a shelter fleishour said 
the rescue was beautiful like a dream the father said 
but the worst the worst was watching my kids starve to death 
right before my eyes watching my little baby wander around that 
boat looking for something anything to eat 
fleishour said he and his family left san diego on sept 12 for 
what should have been about a twoweek sail to hawaii bringing 
enough food and water 40 gallons to last 16 days 
but the boat hit a squall and drifted for about 700 miles they 
got the boat back on course but its sails broke and rations ran 
low he said 
it got rough a lot of times we lost hope but i tried to be 
tough for the kids fleishour said we caught five fish in 17 
days and caught rainwater and licked the dew off in the morning 
the navy spotted us thursday night but it was friday before 
we were all on board he said they gave us soup and ham 
sandwiches i dont know how much longer we could have lasted 
a construction worker who was born in hawaii but lived in 
california for 31 years fleishour said he would stay in hawaii and 
look for a job

a weapons manufacturer tuesday 
unveiled the first south africanmade pistol a result of the 
governments campaign to negate the effects of an international 
arms boycott 
the 9mm pistol called the z88 was developed for the south 
african police by a subsidiary of the state arms corporation 
south africa had been able to import pistols despite the arms 
embargo implemented by the united nations in 1977 but officials 
said prices were excessive and delivery times often slow 
law and order minister adriaan vlok said the new pistol stood 
head and shoulders above foreignmade models 
since the embargo was imposed the weapons industry has 
developed into south africas most lucrative manufacturing sector 
despite attempts by the united nations to discourage members from 
buying south african arms 
janes defense weekly the respected british military 
publication estimated that south africa earned 900 million last 
year exporting arms to 23 countries

the catering staff of britains house of commons 
should be sent to the french national assembly and other european 
capitals to become civilized about cooking a lawmaker said 
tuesday 
teresa gorman a conservative member of parliament said that 
european parliamentary chefs should also be sent to london to 
transform the grizzly cuisine in parliament 
they english chefs are serving up all this sausage and beans 
and plum duff a rich dessert which is supposedly what we like 
mrs gorman said 
but we get no option there is a monopoly in the catering 
service in the commons and we should break it 
the only way to do that is to arrange an exchange scheme 
whereby our entire catering staff go to paris rome and then bonn 
with their catering teams coming to westminster in rotation she 
said 
the food we get at westminster is pretty grizzly all these 
steaming pots of horrible lumps of meat that have been in the 
steamer for about 10 hours 
mrs gorman said she believes french chefs would civilize 
the english chefs in the art of cooking 
our catering staff should be shifted around europe preferably 
not coming back she said 
they will start putting arsenic in my soup if i go on like 
this she added

the united states has gained 
unprecedented credibility with arab leaders as a result of its 
largescale naval commitment in the persian gulf according to the 
general who runs us military operations in the strategic waterway 
this may be the first successful military application of a 
political objective that weve pulled off perhaps since korea 
said gen george b crist 
the fourstar marine corps officer who retires next month as 
commander of us central command said in an interview aboard the 
us navys gulf flagship uss la salle 
the united states has its strongestever relations with arab 
states who originally expected washington to cut and run 
rather than become deeply involved in trying to stop iranian 
military moves in the gulf 
the soviet union whose effort to establish a presence in the 
gulf helped spur the us decision recently has bolstered its 
fleet and is not showing any signs of withdrawal 
the united states will continue to reduce its naval force if 
the aug 20 iraqiran ceasefire holds but kuwait will decide when 
to remove the stars and stripes from 11 oil tankers reflagged by 
the reagan administration 17 months ago as protection from iranian 
attack 
a major mine threat still exists and as allied navies pull 
out the big question is who will wind up with the task of 
clearing them 
crist 57 has been both diplomat and military officer during 
his threeyear tenure at the tampa flabased central command 
which began as a onetime ready reaction force and now 
administers us military affairs in 19 countries 
this encompasses the gulf where danger to shipping from the 
eightyear iraqiran war prompted last years massive naval buildup 
by the united states and five european governments 
crist said that commitment has enabled washington to establish 
better diplomatic ties and closer cooperation and coordination 
militarily with gulf arab governments than ever before 
weve moved mountains he said they were absolutely 
convinced we were going to cut and run we didnt he added in a 
parting comment without elaboration it was a near thing 
though 
most arab states are cool toward the united states because of 
its proisrael stance and rarely praise us policy but crist 
said washington has managed to win new friends in the gulf 
they dont want the russians in they like the americans 
were not colonial were not overbearing he said in working 
with americans he added theyve gained a lot more confidence in 
their own capabilities that they didnt have before 
although refusing to allow us bases on their territory 
kuwait saudi arabia bahrain and oman quietly have provided 
limited support facilities for the navy which crist said he could 
not have done without 
crist said the mine threat is serious in the northern gulf 
where both belligerents sowed mines other us officers have said 
there may be as many as 200 left 
six us mine sweepers were probably the last capability he 
would remove crist said some european navies already are 
withdrawing theirs and its unclear whether the united states will 
wind up with the mineclearing task he said 
that decision may fall to army lt gen h norman schwarzkopf 
scheduled to succeed crist at central command on nov 23 
when the reflagged convoys began the navys gulfbased middle 
east force included only the la salle and four combatants as the 
tanker war escalated the us regional fleet grew to as many 
as 40 ships there currently are 26 including 10 in the gulf 
crist said the united states would ratchet this thing down 
to around the original level as circumstances permit but will 
never leave the gulf entirely 
weve been here since 1949 and as long as the russians stay 
around i dont think were going to turn the keys to the storeroom 
over he said 
he said the soviets keep seven to nine ships in the area and 
are not showing any signs of withdrawal 
moscow recently deployed the 11000ton hospital ship ob fitted 
as a floating rest center for soviet sailors he said 
although the navy recently ended close escort of the kuwaiti 
tankers crist said the ships will have traditional protection 
as long as kuwait complies with us maritime and tax laws

here are excerpts from the citation by 
the royal swedish academy of science awarding the nobel memorial 
prize in economic science to maurice allais of france 
one of the principal tasks of basic research in economics is to 
formulate a rigorous model of equilibrium in markets and examine 
the efficiency of this equilibrium the problem dates back to adam 
smith and his theory of the invisible hand which coordinates a 
to all appearances chaotic structure comprised of a multitude 
of independent and individual decisions based on selfinterest 
paradoxically this chaos gives rise to coordinated equilibria 
based on market prices firms production decisions will correspond 
to consumers planned consumption 
the foremost contribution of maurice allais was made in the 
1940s when he continued to develop walras and paretos work by 
providing increasingly rigorous mathematical formulations of market 
equilibrium and the efficiency properties of markets on the basis 
of mathematical models of households and firms planning and 
choice he introduced a very general formulation of the conditions 
for market equilibrium 
allais outstanding achievements may be characterized as basic 
research in economics by his links to an older french tradition in 
economic research maurice allais is the most prominent figure in 
modern economic research in france as regards basic theory and 
applications to publicsector planning even though his fundamental 
research has been relatively little known beyond the 
frenchspeaking sphere allais has had a farreaching indirect 
impact through younger french economists who have been strongly 
influenced by his work 
the sum of allais productive achievements in economic theory is 
considerable moreover he has carried out various applied studies 
in eg operations research and has participated extensively in 
debates in the french press alongside his accomplishments as an 
economist allais has published studies in history and physics 
particularly geophysics

the disappearances and mutilations of up to 
30 cats have distressed residents in a city neighborhood but 
police suspect that crazy kids rather than a cult are 
responsible 
it really has bothered us said vicky lusk we dont want 
children finding mutilated animals 
twentyfive to 30 cats have disappeared since late spring said

been found 
parts of dismembered cats appear to have been left in places 
where they will be spotted easily mrs lusk said

on the golf course she said 
it definitely is not a coyote or other animal the heads 
have been cut off or they have been cut in half she said 
somebody has been doing this

she has received several calls from pet owners in surrey hills who 
reported their cats missing her organization has posted a 500 
reward for information leading to the arrest and conviction of 
those responsible she said

dismemberings to any cult or to suggest that the culprits could 
attack people 
we havent seen or heard of children being approached 
smart said 
but mrs lusk remained unconvinced 
we cant prove any rituals are involved she said 
everybody knows there are cults that do use cats the parts of

mathias rust who landed his small plane on red 
square last year wants to return to moscow but this time with a 
ticket a soviet official said tuesday 
foreign ministry spokesman gennady gerasimov made it clear 
however that the west german will find the welcome in moscow no 
warmer than it was the first time around when he was sentenced to 
four years in prison for malicious hooliganism violating 
international flight rules and illegally entering the soviet union 
rust was freed in august by a special act of the supreme soviet 
the national legislature and expelled to west germany after more 
than a year in prison but gerasimov noted the criminal case 
remains and he can expect some difficulties if he wants to come 
back 
rust was arrested on landing in red square and spent the next 14 
months in moscows lefortovo prison he was driven directly from 
the prison to sheremetyevo airport when he was expelled 
the young pilot evaded soviet air defenses before buzzing the 
kremlin and landing on before a startled crowd on red square on may 
28 1987 
the flight also prompted the soviet union to fire its defense 
minister and the air defense chief and to treat rust as a criminal 
rather than the peace advocate he claimed to be at his trial

iraq has agreed to the exchange of 
prisoners of war taken in the persian gulf war but maintains the 
move is not related to its peace talks with iran according to a 
document released today 
ismat kittani iraqs ambassador to the united nations said in 
a letter to secretarygeneral javier perez de cuellar that iraq 
will begin the pow exchange if iran reciprocates 
in the iraqi letter to perez de cuellar dated monday kittani 
separated the move to release prisoners from the talks over 
security council resolution 598 the un peace plan to end the 
8year war 
since the exchange of prisoners is a humanitarian matter in 
response to a red cross request our agreement on this step is 
unrelated to the other issues referred to in the un plan 
security council resolution 598 called for an immediate 
ceasefire withdrawal of troops to internationally recognized 
boundries and the exchange of prisoners 
the two nations accepted a unmediated ceasefire that began 
aug 20 but peace talks have been deadlocked since just after they 
began aug 25 
kittanis letter said iraq has asked the international committee 
of the red cross to begin registering all prisoners of war who are 
not yet on official pow lists and asked for detailed medical 
examinations of all pows in iran and iraq 
each nation is to receive a copy of each pows medical report 
before their exchange kittani said 
according to the red cross iran has 50182 prisoners and iraq 
19284 prisoners but un officials and diplomats in iran and iraq 
believe iran has 6000070000 prisoners and iraq 3000050000 
prisoners 
in baghdad iraq a senior iraqi official today rejected a 
condition offered by iran for a permanent settlement of the war 
foreign undersecretary nizzar hamdoun said iran was setting 
unacceptable conditions by insisting that both countries maintain a 
1975 treaty setting the border in the middle of the shattalarab 
waterway 
iraq said the treaty which draws the border in the middle of 
the waterway instead of along the iranian shoreline is no longer 
valid 
the iranian position is an attempt to pressurize iraq to 
relinquish its political and legal rights while the two sides are 
discussing purely technical issues hamdoun said 
irans foreign minister aliakbar velayati said monday that 
iran agreed to the un peace plan but only on condition that the 
1975 treaty is upheld 
peace talks stalled over iraqs insistance the waterway be 
cleared of silt and ships that were sunk early in the war iran had 
rejected the demand saying it was a secondary issue that could be 
settled later 
both sides have blamed each other for the stalemate in 
negotiations which resume next week in geneva

democrat michael dukakis said today republican policies caused 
last years stock market plunge and he promised big economic 
changes to avoid another rival george bush declared the iron 
curtain a rusting curtain but said us vigilence is still 
necessary 
both men said the presidential race is not over despite a new 
poll showing a big bush lead with just three weeks till election 
day 
bush in remarks prepared for delivery in fulton mo where 
winston churchill 46 years ago used the term iron curtain in a 
speech said 
the iron curtain still stretches from stettin to trieste but 
its a rusting curtain 
the soviets are restrained by their own troubles but they are 
also restrained by our strength our ability to deter aggression 
the unity of the democracies he said 
bush declined to celebrate his lead in public opinion surveys 
saying there are undecided voters out there the race is close 
in many states no votes can be taken for granted and im not 
taking any votes for granted i will continue to campaign as an 
underdog 
dukakis speaking in kalamazoo mich to a western michigan 
university audience said weve got to end the republican 
rainbow coalition of red ink for our children pink slips for our 
workers greenmail for sharp operators on wall street and golden 
parachutes for top corporate executives 
turning to the stock market drop which occurred one year ago 
wednesday dukakis said and remember why it happened the trade 
deficit had soared republican policies of borrow and spend and 
borrow and spend had done the damage 
interest rates were going up to attract the foreign bankers we 
needed to buy our massive federal debt and the speculative bubble 
burst as it always does 
he pledged that during the first four years of a dukakis 
administration well turn that trade deficit back into a trade 
surplus 
dukakis spent much of monday trying to reinvigorate his 
campaign even as a new poll showed him falling farther behind 
bush the democrat also took a swipe at bush during a rally with 
black voters in columbus ohio saying something is very wrong 
when a presidential candidate calls jesse helms a hero and jesse 
jackson a hustler 
jackson himself in an interview today on cbs this morning 
disputed any suggestion that he has not worked hard enough for 
dukakis the man who beat him for the democratic nomination at the 
partys atlanta convention in july 
the fact is since atlanta ive traveled more miles spoken to 
more people and registered more voters for this ticket than any 
democrat has jackson said 
he said dukakis has the support of black voters and can beat 
bush if other democrats work as hard for the ticket as jackson has 
bush used a tour of a martin marietta defense plant in 
littleton colo on monday to talk of a military role in securing 
world peace and to ridicule dukakis defense stand 
the vice president is not letting up on his attacks on dukakis 
despite a 17point lead in the latest nationwide poll the bush 
campaign is releasing three new television ads today including one 
incorporating news footage of dukakis driving a tank said 
spokeswoman sheila tate 
the washington post reported today that the bush campaign has 
saved more than half of its 30 million advertising budget and will 
target the airwaves in california new jersey and ohio 
the newspaper said the information was based on an internal 
campaign document obtained by the post the bush campaign had no 
comment on the report said ms tate 
another bush ad which aired this past weekend suggests that 
only the vice president is experienced enough to negotiate with 
soviet leader mikhail s gorbachev 
this is no time to train somebody in how to meet with the 
russians the commercial says this is the time for strength 
and experience this is the time for somebody whos ready on day 
one to be president 
bushs running mate indiana sen dan quayle said today at 
eastern illinois university at the beginning of a bus tour of 
small and mediumsize illinois towns that this years election 
marks an american turning point that only the gop can properly 
handle 
democratic vice presidential candidate lloyd bentsen was 
campaigning in california the biggest electoral college prize with 
47 votes 
bentsen campaigning in california monday invoked the image of 
harry trumans comefrombehind victory in decrying gop distortions 
of dukakis record 
it was harry truman who said that you have to appeal to the 
best instincts of people not to their worst bentsen said 
sometimes you can win a few elections that way but you really 
hurt your country 
meanwhile an nbcwall street journal poll showed bush leading 
dukakis 5538 percent among 1378 likely voters surveyed friday 
through sunday the poll had a margin of error of plus or minus 
three percentage points 
almost threequarters of those polled said they expected bush to 
win the election including half of dukakis own supporters 
but the democratic nominee and his running mate disputed the 
surveys results 
this business of polls is really having a terrible effect 
on the process dukakis said i can only tell you that there are 
other polls that say very different things about where we are and 
where the race is 
bentsen said he didnt believe the poll was accurate and said 
you see wide fluctuations among those polls thats whats 
happening 
for his part bush said only run like youre 17 points 
behind

americans are increasingly reluctant to 
tolerate landfills near their homes but havent really faced the 
problem of what to do about all that garbage according to a poll 
commissioned by wastehandling companies 
the poll results released tuesday by the national solid waste 
management association were taken from telephone interviews with 
1500 randomly selected adults in february telephone interviews 
with 500 opinion leaders in march and facetoface interviews 
with another 1500 people in july and august 
the february survey found that 30 percent of respondents would 
favor building new landfills in their communities to handle garbage 
and trash while 62 percent were opposed the remainder were 
undecided 
opposition was about the same 65 percent in the summer poll 
but those in favor had dropped to 20 percent 
rob wasserstrom public affairs director of the association 
said that even if half the nations garbage were recycled in five 
years the remaining garbage would exceed our landfill capacity 
without new landfills or incincerators 
the julyaugust survey found that 33 percent favored state or 
federal boards that could override local opposition to new 
facilities and 46 percent opposed i was surprised that 
support was as high as a third wasserstrom said 
among opinion leaders 57 percent favored such boards and 40 
percent opposed 
when incinerators that can sell energy to hold down costs are 
matched against landfills incinerators win but people still 
dont want incinerators according to the poll fortyseven percent 
of the sample opposed such wastetoenergy plants in the 
community and 36 percent were in favor 
peoples attitudes about garbage disposal are highly 
contradictory wasserstrom said a large majority of the 
population would like to believe recycling is the answer yet 
many respondents correctly indentified 25 to 50 percent as a 
realistic range that could be recycled 
jack lyman director of resource recovery programs for the 
association said he had discovered a nimey not in my 
election year to go along with the wellknown nimby 
response not in my back yard 
what we need in this country is the political will to deal 
with these problems lyman said 
seventy percent of the february sample and 84 percent of the 
summer group said recycling could solve much of the solid waste 
disposal problem when those polled were asked how much could be 
recycled the median answer was 44 percent half named a 
percentage above 44 percent and half named one below 
the environmental protection agency has estimated that 10 
percent of the annual stream of 230 million tons of garbage and 
trash is recycled currently with another 5 percent incinerated 
the agency hopes to cajole and persuade state and local governments 
into making that 25 percent in 1992 
the waste association represents 2500 companies that handle 
half the nations household waste and 95 percent of its industrial 
waste it has conducted polls on garbage questions for several 
years 
for a poll of 1500 people the margin of error is about 3 
percentage points either way for a poll of 500 the margin is a 
little less than 45 points

president reagans spokesman on tuesday 
dismissed speculation of a fifth superpower summit in the waning 
days of the administration saying the idea is completely ruled 
out 
spokesman marlin fitzwater said the white house generally 
hesitates to make flat statements about future plans but in the 
case of another summit we have to say no possiblity 
no plans are under way for reagan to meet with soviet leader 
mikhail gorbachev before the president quits office in midjanuary 
fitzwater said yes i think it is completely ruled out he 
said in response to a reporters question 
the superpower leaders have held four summit since they first 
met in geneva switzerland in november 1985 other summits were 
conducted in iceland in october 1986 in washington in december 
1987 and in moscow last may 
in washington the two men signed a treaty eliminating their 
countries intermediaterange nuclear weapons 
fitzwater also said that comments made over the weekend by 
deputy cia director robert m gates were totally consistent 
with the administrations views on what is happening inside the 
soviet union 
gates in speeches friday and saturday gave a gloomy assessment 
of current events in the soviet union and said moscow has stepped 
up its spying activities against americans since gorbachev came to 
power 
he said gorbachevs reforms have not brought about economic 
improvements and i would even say it is doubtful that gorbachev 
can rejuvenate the soviet system moreover the soviet system is 
threatened by ethnic disturbances he said 
while the administration might not agree with the cia on every 
point fitzwater said gates comments quite correctly point out 
the things that we need to be very concerned about in dealing with 
the soviet union 
he said reagan and defense secretary frank carlucci have pointed 
out that the united states wants to see the soviet union reduce its 
defense budget to underscore a commitment to world peace 
we feel we do have better relations with the soviet union and 
the president has good relations with secretary general 
gorbachev fitzwater said 
but the system is the same the country is the same and the 
threat is the same and we need to be quite aware of that he said

plagued by high winds in the 
shinnecock inlet officials on tuesday postponed plans to tow a 
stranded whale from peconic bay to the open ocean they said they 
may try thursday 
the adolescent minke whale wandered into peconic bay last week 
according to sam sadove the director of the okeanos research 
foundation he said the whale is emaciated from lack of food and 
disoriented but is behaving normally 
pat logan an administrative assistant at the foundation said 
winds in the inlet forced researchers to cancel the towing attempt 
and will likely force a postponement until thursday 
when conditions improve divers from the foundation will attach 
a rope to the whales tail and then put the animal in a harness and 
remove the tail rope according to sadove 
the whale will then be attached to two coast guard boats and 
towed into the atlantic 
the whale was first discovered by boaters in sag harbor two 
weeks ago and then moved into shallow waters of peconic bay 
sadove says the whale is 17 feet long and weighs five tons this is 
the first whale sighted in peconic bay according to okeanoss 
records which go back to 1880

the citys economy fared much better than 
expected in the year after last octobers stock market crash 
according to a report released tuesday by state comptroller edward 
v regan 
while the securities industry clearly was hurt by the crash 
the impact has been far less severe than originally forecast 
regan said furthermore the rest of the citys economy has been 
little affected 
the report predicted that the city will gain 35000 jobs this 
year despite postcrash predictions of job losses ranging from 
10000 to 47000 
the projected 1988 loss of 7000 security industry jobs will be 
more than offset by an increase of 30000 service jobs according 
to the report even businesses closely tied to finance such as law 
and printing have shrugged off the impact of the crash 
the report listed these signs of economic vitality 
the city unemployment rate fell to 41 percent in the second 
quarter of the year the lowest since 1970 
the gross city product a measure of economic output 
posted its strongest annual growth in 20 years 34 percent for the 
12 months ending with june 
retail sales and tourism are up and the welfare caseload is 
down 
but the report warns that the city faces problems the 
securities industry could lose an another 7000 jobs next year and 
there also may be a slowdown in employment in the real estate and 
banking industries 
the report also noted that the 35000job increase for 1988 is 
smaller than the figure for each of the four previous years and 
that many of those still employed in the security industry have 
taken pay cuts

vice president george bush speaking where 
winston churchill gave his famed iron curtain speech 42 years 
ago declared today the barriers surrounding the soviet bloc are 
rusting but that america must still stand tough against the soviet 
union 
bush invoked the british statesmans memory in remarks prepared 
for delivery at westminster college where churchill popularized 
the phrase iron curtain in 1946 to describe the barrier of 
selfimposed isolation and secrecy that enclosed the soviet union 
and eastern europe after world war ii 
noting his widening lead over democratic rival michael dukakis 
in preelection polls the republican nominee said both churchill 
and former president truman knew that no election was over until 
it was really over 
there are undecided voters out there bush said the race 
is close in many states no votes can be taken for granted and im 
not taking any votes for granted i will continue to campaign as an 
underdog 
bush did not include any attack or mention of dukakis in his 
speech today which quoted at length from churchills speech at 
fulton 
the iron curtain still stretches from stettin to trieste but 
its a rusting curtain bush said 
the vice president said there is a new hope of change in 
eastern bloc countries but it would be wrong to conclude that the 
soviets were deterred from aggression by their preoccupation with 
economic troubles 
the soviets are restrained by their own troubles but they are 
also restrained by our strength our ability to deter aggression 
the unity of the democracies bush said 
he said us military strength made possible the signing last 
year of the treaty calling for destruction of all us and soviet 
mediumrange nuclear missiles 
bush said similar reductions aimed at balancing us and soviet 
convention arms in europe will be a high priority for me 
on monday in skokie ill the vice president stumped for jewish 
votes in the heavily jewish suburb of chicago that was wrenched a 
decade ago by a battle over a neonazi march 
speaking in a driving rain at an outdoor memorial to holocaust 
victims bush said the nazi slaughter of 6 million jews in world 
war ii was an evil far more vast than any in human history 
but he said the memorial offers hope for the persistence of 
jewish dreams and for the promise of jewish lives yet unlived 
bush later had time to comment on his surge in the polls 
including a new nbc newswall street journal poll showing him ahead 
of his democratic opponent by 55 percent to 38 percent 
we have three weeks to go from this very minute he told a 
rally at the college of du page in glen ellyn ill and i am 
running as if i were 10 points behind im not going to let up 
in columbia mo where he spent the night bush said run like 
youre 17 points behind 
today bush was traveling to westminster college in fulton mo 
for a foreign policy speech westminster college is where the late 
british prime minister winston churchill introduced the phrase 
iron curtain to refer to the soviet bloc countries in 1946 
continuing attacks on dukakis as weak on foreign affairs and 
defense the bush campaign was planning to air a new ad using 
footage from a dukakis campaign appearance that backfired on the 
democrat his test ride in a tank 
an ad that was released over the weekend suggested bush would be 
best able to deal with soviet leader mikhail s gorbachev this 
is no time to train somebody in how to meet with the russians 
the ad says 
bush spokeswoman sheila tate had no information on a washington 
post report today that the campaign was tentatively planning to 
spend more than 15 million of its 30 millionplus advertising 
budget in three states the three states are california new jersey

while in skokie bush did not mention the turmoil that occurred 
10 years ago when a neonazi group planned a march in the 
community the american civil liberties union successfully fought 
efforts by the community to block the march but the white 
supremacists decided to hold it in a chicago park instead 
the bush campaign gave reporters no chance to get close enough

three escaped antiapartheid 
activists holed up in the us consulate for five weeks plan to 
call the states bluff and emerge from their refuge wednesday 
the activists disclosed their decision tuesday after advice was 
relayed to them from jailed black leader nelson mandela the three 
previously had said they mistrusted the governments pledge to let 
them leave the consulate without being redetained 
mandelas wife winnie said monday she discussed the activists 
when she met saturday with her husband who is recovering from 
tuberculosis at a hospital in cape town mrs mandela said she 
passed on unspecified suggestions from her husband to the escapees 
lawyers 
the three activists prominent leaders of banned opposition 
groups have been living in a meeting room at the consulate on the 
11th floor of a johannesburg office building since their escape 
sept 13 
the government has said the men are free to leave and will not 
be detained again or restricted 
the three have called the states bluff and intend to leave 
to claim their freedom said a statement issued on their 
behalf by the congress of south african trade unions the largest 
antiapartheid group not banned from functioning 
the activists decision is a major test of the governments 
undertaking and will once again bring the spotlight on the 
detention and persecution of antiapartheid activists said the 
congress the main black labor federation 
the three activists are murphy morobe and mohammed valli moosa 
senior leaders of the united democratic front and vusi khanyile 
chairman of the national education crisis committee 
all had been held more than a year without charge when they 
slipped away from guards while undergoing physiotherapy at a 
johannesburg hospital morobe and khanyile are black valli moosa 
is indian 
if the state detains or restricts them it will deepen the 
credibility problems of the apartheid regime the congress 
statement said government repression has not and will not 
succeed in destroying the strength and mass support of the 
democratic movement 
us officials have said they would not force the three to leave 
despite a policy of not allowing diplomatic premises to be used by 
asylum seekers

and the embassy issued no statement tuesday the south african 
government also had no immediate comment

three prominent american jewish groups are 
charging that hardline lobbying for israel is out of step with 
the consensus of the organized jewish community 
the attack on the american israel public affairs committee an 
influential washington lobbying group surfaced in a letter 
published tuesday by the new york times and verified as accurate 
a senior official of the committee told the associated press 
this whole episode is bound to confuse members of congress 
the committee is the principal proisrael lobbying group in 
washington and concentrates its efforts on congress 
the attack came from leaders of the american jewish committee 
the american jewish congress and the antidefamation league of 
bnai brith 
they disagreed in the letter with aipacs opposition to a us 
missile sale to kuwait an oilrich arab country the lobbying 
groups attempt to force the closing of the palestine liberation 
organizations mission to the united nations and the committees 
campaign to deny a visa to plo chairman yasser arafat in the event 
he tried to appear before the un general assembly 
an aipac official who spoke on condition of anonymity from los 
angeles where the group was holding a board meeting tuesday said 
more consultation is always desirable among jewish groups 
he said leaders of the committee would meet in washington with 
the critics on nov 3 
the kuwaiti arms sale was modified but was not blocked by 
congress a court in new york agreeing with the state department 
ruled the plo office should stay open despite a congressional vote 
to close it so far arafat has not indicated he wanted to address 
the united nations 
aipac is one of the most effective lobbying groups in washington 
and organizes support for house and senate members it finds 
friendly to israel the committee has nurtured us arms sales to 
israel and the strategic cooperation agreement with the jewish 
state at the same time the committee has played a leading role in 
persuading congress to block or trim a number of arms sales to arab 
countries not at peace with israel 
the letter called for closer consultation with the american 
jewish committee the american jewish congress and the 
antidefamation league which already are represented on aipacs 
executive committee 
the letter said in part we believe such consultation and 
coordination will help avoid situations in which aipac pursues 
policies that are at variance with the consensus of the organized 
jewish community as occurred most recently with respect to the 
kuwaiti arms deal and the plo mission to the united nations and 
threatens to occur again with respect to arafats possible 
forthcoming visit to the united nations

the use of the hallucinogenic drug peyote in 
indian religious ceremonies is protected by the federal 
constitutions guarantee of religious freedom the state supreme 
court ruled today 
the decision involves two former douglas county drug counselors 
who were fired and denied jobless benefits for using peyote during 
native american church religious ceremonies 
in todays ruling the high court expanded its 1986 decision in 
which it said denying jobless benefits to the two men violated 
their constitutional rights to freely practice their religion 
the state had appealed the earlier ruling to the us supreme 
court which sent it back to the state court for a definitive 
ruling on whether peyote could be legally used in religious 
ceremonies in oregon under state criminal law 
peyote is a cactus that contains mescaline a hallucinogenic 
drug thats illegal in oregon possession of the drug is a felony 
deputy attorney general bill gary in oral arguments before the 
state supreme court earlier this year said the state has 
constitutional authority to impose a ban on all uses of peyote 
gary also argued that to permit religious use of that drug would 
open the door to all kinds of religious drug exemptions to be 
claimed in criminal trials 
the supreme court in todays decision noted that oregon laws 
against the possession of controlled substances including peyote 
make no exception for the sacramental use of peyote 
at the same time the court said that the outright prohibition 
of good faith religious use of peyote by adult members of the 
native american church would violate the first amendment directly 
and as interpreted by congress 
the ruling involved alfred smith and galen black who were fired 
from their jobs with the roseburgbased douglas county council on 
alcohol and drug abuse prevention and treatment for using peyote at 
religious ceremonies 
smith and black were denied unemployment benefits on grounds 
that they lost their jobs because of misconduct the councils 
rules forbid the use of alcohol or illegal drugs 
sueanne lovendahl a roseburg lawyer representing the two men 
argued that the use of peyote in the indian church is tightly 
controlled and that its use outside the church is a sacrilege

scientists and shrimpers are closely 
watching to see how some giant shrimp that escaped from a south 
carolina research facility will affect the native crop 
the shrimp scientifically called the penaeus monodon but 
carrying nicknames such as the giant tiger have been found in 
commercial nets from georgetown sc to st augustine fla 
this will be very interesting to watch said dr sheldon 
dobkin a professor of biological sciences at florida atlantic 
university but certainly it is not desirable for exotics to be 
loosed on nature even though this is a nice shrimp 
the exotic shrimp native to the waters of australia india and 
southeast asia weigh up to onequarter pound each and reportedly 
taste good but some shrimpers are concerned that they might eat 
native shrimp and carry contagious diseses 
leonard crosby a commercial shrimper who manages the bryan 
county fishermans coop on the georgia coast said boats docking at 
his facility have landed about 15 of the giant tigers since august 
crosby said he notified researchers with the university of 
georgias marine extension center in brunswick because he wanted 
more information about the alien shrimp 
officials of the waddell mariculture center in bluffton sc 
from which the shrimp escaped said the giant tigers were certified 
diseasefree by the hawaiian hatchery that supplied them 
paul christian a biologist with the marine extension center who 
began documenting catches and doing research on the giant tigers in 
august said the imported shrimp are not as inclined to eat their 
own kind as native white shrimp 
manager steve hopkins said the waddell center imported more than 
700000 quarterinch tiger shrimp this spring and used them to 
stock three artificial ponds on the south carolina coast including 
a pond at the bluffton facility where researchers conduct 
mariculture experiments 
although the center and private mariculture operations have 
successfully raised imported pacific ocean shrimp in their ponds in 
past years this was the first year any of the giant tiger shrimp 
were brought to the atlantic coast he said 
at the bluffton center finemesh screens were installed in the 
floodgates of dikes surrounding the pond to prevent the shrimp from 
migrating to tidal waters hopkins said 
but the shrimp apparently went around the screens he said 
hopkins said he has no idea how many of the 100000 shrimp 
initially stocked in the centers pond found their way to open 
waters 
hopkins first realized that some of the giant shrimp had escaped 
when a few showed up in a drainage canal leading from the pond to a 
tidal waterway he said 
then we got a call in late july from a shrimp boat captain who 
said he had an oddlooking shrimp hopkins said

environmentalists are dueling with 
business and the legislature in washington state over rival ballot 
measures that each side claims is the best way to clean up toxic 
waste sites 
environmental groups back initiative 97 which would give the 
state department of ecology unilateral authority to order a site 
cleaned up impose stiff fines and pursue criminal sanctions 
against polluters who balked 
but rival ballot measure 97b backed by the business community 
and most state legislators would allow polluters time to negotiate 
a cleanup plan 
supporters say 97bs strength is it permits the state and 
industry to clean up sites together with industry bearing most of 
the expense if 97b passes it will affirm a toxic waste cleanup 
statute enacted a year ago 
initiative 97 would raise an estimated 634 million to 68 
million through a seventenths of 1 percent tax on toxic 
substances including gasoline and other refined oil products 
measure 97b would raise an estimated 51 million to 56 million 
by means of a eighttenths of 1 percent tax on hazardous 
substances this tax also would apply to refined oil products but 
unlike initiative 97 would exempt refined products exported to 
other states 
the bulk of revenues generated by either measure would go 
towards pay overhead administration and enforcement of the law 
state officials said 
backers of each measure which will be on nov 8 ballots claim 
that theirs is tougher on polluters 
the 97b proposal creates a set of bureaucratic hoops through 
which liable persons can make doe jump before it can get a site 
cleaned up said william ryan a bostonbased specialist on toxic 
waste cleanup laws no other state with toxic waste cleanup 
laws has such a convoluted response as that of the 97b proposal 
but supporters of 97b argue that the laws cooperative approach 
is its strength and the reason that ultimately it is tougher than 
97 
sen mike kreidler dolympia who helped draft the measure 
before it became law at a special legislative session a year ago 
said 97b envisions that polluters themselves will pay more than 70 
percent of negotiated cleanup costs while only a small part of 
the cost will come from the laws special tax on possessors of 
hazardous substances 
initiative 97 meanwhile would rely on a similar tax as its 
primary source of cleanup funding kreidler contended even though 
expected revenues would not begin to cover the estimated 1 billion 
to 2 billion needed to cleanse as many as 400 waste sites in the 
state 
initiative 97 kreidler said assumes that the department of 
ecology will use the tax fund for clean up and then litigate 
to recover the costs he said litigation to recover the balance 
would mean costly delays at best and possibly no money at the end 
david bricklin a main spokesman for the initiative 97 campaign 
and president of the washington environmental council countered 
that initiative 97 also relies heavily on voluntary cleanups it 
is just that ours has a significant stick attached to it to ensure 
that responsible parties step forward to clean up the sites without 
forcing the state to go to court 
supporters of 97b led by aerospace oil and timber interests 
have raised 800000 for their highly visible campaign featuring 
billboards mass mailings and tv advertising 
initiative 97 backers meanwhile have raised only 196000 and 
campaigners acknowledge that 97bs greater financial resources put 
their initiative at a disadvantage 
despite the heated debate some here believe that either measure 
would leave the state with a sound toxic waste policy 
we are not at a crossroads in state environmental policy 
said jeffrey goltz a seattle lawyer and former head of the state 
ecology division of the attorney generals office 
what is left for voters to decide this november are relatively 
minimal modifications of the approach the legislature already 
adopted he said either the initiative or the alternative 
would establish a sound proenvironment toxic waste policy for the 
state without undue burden on industry

an emaciated fiveton whale was stuck 
in a shallow bay off long island today and adverse weather forced 
conservationists to postpone plans to pull the 17foot mammal into 
the atlantic ocean 
the adolescent minke whale wandered into peconic bay last week 
said sam sadove of the okeanos research foundation in hampton bays 
the coast guard and foundation researchers had hoped to harness 
the whale to two boats today and tow it through shinnecock canal 
and shinnecock bay into the atlantic said coast guard petty 
officer steve dowd 
but pat logan an administrative assistant at the foundation 
said winds in the inlet forced researchers to cancel the towing 
attempt for today and will likely force a postponement until 
thursday 
earlier plans to rescue the animal were suspended monday when 
whalewatchers said they hadnt seen the mammal since dusk sunday 
night and there was no signal from a radio transmitter that was 
placed on it saturday sadove said 
but a plane sent up by the foundation sighted the whale around 
330 pm monday he said 
the whale was discovered by boaters in sag harbor two weeks ago 
and moved into the shallow waters of peconic last week this is the 
first whale sighted in the bay according to okeanos records 
which go back to 1880 
about the time the whale was spotted in sag harbor three 
california gray whales became trapped near barrow alaska a rescue

west germany hopes to launch major new 
economic initiatives in the soviet union to cash in on ambitious 
plans to overhaul its economy officials said tuesday 
a 16 billion west german credit to the kremlin signed this 
week has buoyed optimism among businesses in this staunch nato ally 
we believe that west germany can play a leading role in making 
modernization possible in the soviet union said reinhard krause 
an economics ministry spokesman 
west germany has long enjoyed good economic relations with 
moscow and remains its biggest western trading partner despite 
declines in recent years 
soviet president mikhail s gorbachevs economic reforms have 
fueled interest in establishing closer economic and political ties 
krause told the associated press 
officials in bonn see broadening opportunities for more joint 
ventures and for increased west german participation in the 
consumer and supply sectors 
west german firms are involved in 13 joint ventures in the 
soviet union and 35 more are under negotiation 
the soviet union is clearly interested in quickly improving 
the quality of consumer services to its citizens finance 
minister gerhard stoltenberg said 
this is a political opportunity that could lead to many new 
contracts with west german firms stoltenberg said after meeting 
with industrialists in berlin 
the west german enthusiasm in the economic sphere is matched by 
a growing positive public perception of gorbachev and his reforms 
according to a poll released by the munichbased sinus institute 
on tuesday 84 percent of west germans think positively about 
gorbachev 41 percent said they like the soviets and 51 percent 
judged his reforms positively 
important groundwork for expanding west german trade with the 
soviet union was laid monday with the signing of the 16 billion 
credit agreement the biggest foreign credit ever extended by west 
german banks 
deutsche bank ag which heads the consortium of banks signed 
the agreement with moscows bank for foreign economic affairs the 
credit line was set up to finance west german exports primarily in 
the food leather textile and clothing sectors 
west german economic officials hope to expand well beyond those 
areas 
an economics ministry report said that the soviet union holds 
the potential for a wide field of economic cooperation and export 
opportunities in the areas of agriculture energy environmental 
techonology medical equipment and light and heavy machinery 
the report said the soviets have drawn up a list of german firms 
they are interested in dealing with 
there is enormous potential here said peter pietsch a 
finance and trade expert at frankfurts commerzbank 
the soviet union has tremendous market potential for west 
germany and other western nations pietsch said by helping the 
soviet union modernize now we can create the climate and 
conditions for an even larger trade market in future 
economic ties will top the agenda in talks in moscow next week 
between gorbachev and chancellor helmut kohl 
in addition to negotiations for more joint ventures west 
germany hopes to reach agreements in projects ranging from 
developing the mineralrich kola peninsula in the northwestern 
soviet union to the construction of factories 
economics ministry officials also say 12 west german companies 
will sign agreements with the soviet union the companies 
specialize in producing packaging machines furniture processing 
equipment and truck products 
the news weekly der spiegel said an agreement would be signed 
for west german companies to set up a trade center in moscow 
trade between west germany and the soviet union dropped from 
1030 billion in 1986 to 830 billion in 1987 but the economics 
ministry said total trade volume is expected to stabilize at that 
level this year

ittihad hospital as neal cassidy a 37yearold freelance 
photographer from oakland calif doctors said he was hit in the 
right knee by a plastic bullet

tbaileh 14 of nablus officials at st john hospital in nablus 
said he was shot in the chest 
the 5yearold boy died at al ittihad hospital after being shot 
in the chest stomach and left arm as he played in a schoolyard 
hospital officials said 
the boy identified as deyaa fayez was shot when israeli 
soldiers opened fire on youths who threw stones at their patrol car 
from the schoolyard arab reporters said 
doctors said both palestinians were killed by plastic bullets 
the deaths brought to 301 the number of palestinians killed in 
the 10monthold uprising in the territories seized by israel in 
the 1967 middle east war six israelis also have died 
an army spokesman confirmed the two deaths the army also

ms bennis said cassidy told her suddenly without warning 
the soldiers began firing 
she said she did not see the shooting

to contact mr cassidy as promptly as possible we are concerned 
about the safety and welfare of americans

supplement rubber bullets tear gas and lead bullets in quelling 
riots injuries have soared and the use of the new ammunition has 
drawn criticism from the un relief and works agency as well as 
the united states britain and egypt 
plastic bullets are not usually lethal if fired from a distance 
of more than 70 yards the government says they were issued to give 
soldiers an alternative to firing lead bullets 
ms bennis said she and cassidy have been in israel for three 
weeks working on a story about palestinian life officials at the 
government press office in jerusalem said they had no record of 
cassidy being accredited to work in israel

israels supreme court today barred the 
antiarab kach movement of americanborn rabbi meir kahane from 
running in the nov 1 election saying it was racist and 
undemocratic 
but the high court permitted an arabjewish party that calls for 
an independent palestinian state to remain in the race 
police ordered silence among 50 singing supporters of the kach 
party judge menachem eilon then read out the terse decision 
saying the appeal is rejected 
the panel of five judges later released a 27page judgment on 
the appeal in which they wrote that the aims of kach and its 
actions are racist and that it seeks to violently deny the rights 
of segments of the population 
the high court ruled 32 that the progressive list for peace 
could remain in the race the arabjewish party calls for direct 
talks with the palestine liberation organization and an independent 
palestinian alongside israel 
the appeal to the court from the rightwing likud bloc and the 
tehiya party came after it had been rejected by the elections 
committee the rightist parties argued the progressive list for 
peace should be ousted on grounds that it sought the destruction of 
israel as a jewish state 
polls say prime minister yitzhak shamirs likud and the 
leftleaning labor party of foreign minister shimon peres are in a 
close race in the nov 1 election 
the brooklynborn kahane 56 told a news conference that the 
unanimous court decision to bar his party was undemocratic 
in judaism there is no democracy said kahane who was 
thronged by dozens of supporters some wearing yellow tshirts with 
the party emblem a clenched fist inside a star of david 
kahane urged his supporters to boycott the elections 
his ouster was expected to strengthen rightwing parties and 
might give likud the election advantage likud had said it would 
not form a coalition with kahane because of its racist policies 
kahane has called for the expulsion of the 15 million arabs 
living in the occupied west bank and gaza strip as well as the 
700000 arabs residing within israels borders 
the central elections committee said the demand was racist and 
banned the party oct 5 under a new law barring racist parties from 
running for office 
kahane appealed that ruling 
kahane immigrated to israel in 1971 after founding the jewish 
defense league a militant organization blamed for attacks on arabs 
and other opponents of israel in the united states 
also today israeli troops shot and killed a palestinian 
teenager and a 5yearold boy and wounded an american photographer 
in clashes in the west bank city of nablus 
the army confirmed the deaths and the wounding of american neal 
cassidy 37 of oakland calif 
doctors at nablus al ittihad hospital said cassidy was hit in 
the right knee by a plastic bullet 
the deaths brings to 301 the number of arabs killed since the 
palestinian uprising against israeli rule in the occupied lands 
began dec 8 six israelis also have died

coverage of the presidential election by sound 
bite isnt serving the public but what the news media is dishing 
out appears to be what the public wants new cbs news president 
david burke said tuesday 
burke appearing before television critics for the first time 
since he moved over from abc news in july said he did not know how 
to steer the publics attention and thus the news medias away 
from glib quotes and flashy images and onto important issues 
i sort of sense an unwanting to know among the public i mean 
the public is buying the flag factories and pledge of allegiance 
and cardcarrying this and cardcarrying that said burke 
i suppose we havent done our job well if we dont keep 
beating on them that they shouldnt be paying attention to that 
they should be paying attention to other things 
i fault us i expect for being members of this same public 
and not being willing to put on the hair shirt and say sit down 
were going to talk to you about the federal deficit 
burke 52 is the first outsider to head cbs news he had been 
at abc news for 11 years and had served as executive vice president 
since 1986 before entering the news business burke worked in 
democratic politics as secretary to former new york gov hugh 
carey in the 1970s and in the 1960s as administrative assistant to 
us sen edward kennedy dmass 
burke said he supported cbs evening news anchor dan rathers 
decision not to serve as a panelist on the second presidential 
debate calling the forum contrived 
abcs peter jennings was a panelist on the first presidential 
debate in september and nbcs tom brokaw was one of the questioners 
for the vice presidential debate earlier this month 
burke said the league of women voters was right to withdraw its 
sponsorship of the second presidential debate because of the 
numerous restrictions insisted upon by each candidate 
those debates were a contrivance burke said he 
rather was uncomfortable with it i was terribly uncomfortable 
with it i think it was the right decision absolutely the 
right decision 
as far as cbs news regular programming burke indicated strong 
devotion to cbs this morning the 11monthold morning talk 
show and to 48 hours a primetime documentary series that 
premiered last season 
he hedged on the future of west 57th the onagain 
offagain newsmagazine that has languished in a saturday night time 
period since last season but the news division has no alternative 
time period to suggest and the network is not anxious to replace 
it with more expensive entertainment programming burke said 
its not in stone he said 48 hours is in stone the 
morning is in stone

the state department said tuesday it would be 
extremely concerned if the sudan accepted flood relief 
assistance from a palestinian group in return for the release of 
suspected palestinian terrorists in sudanese custody 
department spokesman charles redman said he could not confirm 
reports that abu nidal whose group is held responsible for scores 
of terrorist attacks has sent 4 million in flood relief to the 
sudan 
but redman said the united states would be extremely concerned 
if any donation were accepted in return for the release or lenient 
sentencing of suspected terrorists 
such arrangements would be likely to encourage further 
terrorist attacks he said 
according to a published report five palestinians said to have 
worked for abu nidal are scheduled to be sentenced in khartoum for 
attacks in that city

white house spokesman marlin fitzwater today 
said there is no legal problem with nancy reagans practice of 
borrowing expensive gowns and jewels over the last five years 
at the same time the no 2 man at the office of government 
ethics said his agency sees no need at this time to reassess its 
1982 opinion concluding that such reporting was not required under 
the ethics in government act 
at his daily white house news briefing fitzwater said there 
are a lot of questions and we believe all the questions have been 
answered satisfactorily 
as far as were concerned there is no consequence for 
president reagans financial disclosure forms and tax forms the 
spokesman said 
there is no legal problem there is no ethical problem he 
added 
on monday donald campbell deputy director of the office of 
government ethics said that office in 1982 had concurred with an 
opinion by white house legal counsel fred fielding that mrs reagan 
was not technically required to list the gowns as loans on her 
husbands financial disclosure form 
campbell said today that at this time there is no belief here 
in the office that the decision was not the correct one 
campbell also said however that if theres any indication of 
any error that we made in the past we clearly would take another 
look at it 
elaine crispen the first ladys press secretary denied that 
mrs reagan has kept any of the expensive items she obtained from 
designers and jewelers she said in a statement late monday that 
mrs reagan regrets that she failed to heed the advice of white 
house counsel in 1982 to report such transactions but that this 
was not technically required under the ethics in government act 
today mrs crispen said of the first lady 
basically she set her own little rule she made a promise not 
to do this again and she broke her little promise because she just 
didnt feel she had to do it disclose the transactions 
the spokeswoman noted monday that the office of government 
ethics had ruled in 1982 that loans of apparel to mrs reagan 
need not be reported on the presidents financial disclosure forms 
no paidfor apparel need be reported on any forms the 
spokeswomans statement said 
campbell said the issue was first raised in 1982 when 
thenwhite house counsel fred fielding sent a letter to the ethics 
office detailing the situation at the time 
campbell said fielding concluded that this was not something 
that needed to be reported on reagans financial disclosure form 
the forms are required under the ethics in government act of 1978 
j jackson walter thendirector of the ethics office agreed 
with fieldings conclusion at the time campbell said adding that 
mrs reagan has been operating under that guidance since then 
mrs crispen said mrs reagan did report such transactions 
anyway on her husbands form in 1982 about six months after the 
question arose she said the first lady decided at the time to 
err on the side of compliance but acknowledged that mrs reagan 
stopped reporting the loans thereafter 
mrs reagans spokeswoman said the first lady has not kept any 
of the numerous dresses and outfits loaned to her by designers 
to a typical woman there are some gowns that are so 
spectacular that you would only wear it once she said 
the apparel mrs reagan received was either paid for given to 
her personally as gifts by old friends and not subject to 
reporting or loaned to her and returned she said 
campbell said however that any time a question is raised about 
a decision by the ethics office a review process is triggered and 
that such a reassessment will take place in this instance 
the matter of mrs reagans use of expensive borrowed clothes 
was raised in the current edition of time magazine it said she 
continued to accept and wear expensive evening gowns and other 
outfits furnished by leading couturiers such as james galanos and 
david hayes after saying she would discontinue the practice 
chris blazakis a former business associate of galanos said he 
has identified more than 300 photographs of mrs reagan since 1982 
in which she is wearing outfits worth more than 1 million total 
los angeles designer hayes told time that mrs reagan has kept 
some of the 60 to 80 madetoorder outfits she borrowed during the 
past eight years 
we think of it as loans its wonderful hayes said she 
has been a sensation for my business 
the time article included pictures of mrs reagan wearing 
expensive gowns while posing with among others french president 
francois mitterrand and canadian prime minister brian mulroney the 
article said she borrowed gowns ranging in value to as high as 
22000 for one such outfit 
mrs crispen said that for any first lady there have been 
mounds of things that you have to go to and you have to borrow 
and its not illegal 
i think she has made americans so proud of the way she has 
represented them at official events the press secretary said 
white house spokesman marlin fitzwater described reagan as 
upset over these attacks on the first lady he said that no 
internal review had been commenced in the wake of the time report 
saying i dont know that there needs to be one 
reagans presidential salary is 200000 a year and his 1987 
tax form disclosed modest income that mrs reagan had received in 
talent fees and residuals from appearances on network television 
shows but no information about her clothing

eight snakes snatched from their zoo cages were 
returned unharmed in cloth sacks but the reptile rustlers who kept 
them over the weekend slid into hiding police said 
juveniles were apparently keeping the two boa constrictors and 
six pythons from the dallas zoo at a house in a dallas suburb 
authorities said but before police could follow up on a tip the 
snakenappers left the dwelling 
jim murphy a curator said he was at the zoo monday evening 
when a father and son came into the office and said the boy had 
something he wanted to return the snakes worth an estimated 
8000 were in cloth sacks he said 
no arrests have been made in the case 
were just relieved theyre back said murphy referring to 
the six pythons and two boas 
zoo director warren iliff said the snakes were taken from their 
cages in a work area at the zoo between 5 pm friday and 11 am 
saturday workers found no signs of forced entry and lids still 
covered the snakes cages some of which were found latched 
i dont know how they could have gotten them iliff said 
we have to make sure it doesnt happen again 
iliff said none of the snakes is poisonous but whoever took 
them would have needed some knowledge of reptiles to pull off the 
heist 
the snakes did not appear to have been abused or neglected 
iliff and murphy said 
the theft of the boas especially worried zoo officials said 
spokeswoman victoria furber the two snakes came from madagascar

they cast 231 ballots trying to elect a 
mayor but the acting mayor and city council finally gave up early 
tuesday and went home to bed 
i think the people of westover deserve better than what were 
providing said councilman thomas talerico before the fivemember 
city council and acting mayor mary c koon gave up trying to elect 
a replacement for former mayor francis teter sr who resigned last 
month 
the council and koon adjourned their meeting early tuesday after 
failing to break a 33 deadlock between koon and donald roderick a 
town sewer board member 
koon 53 and roderick 57 were among eight applicants for the 
job 
during the nearly sixhour meeting koon and talerico had a 
showdown over koons right to vote for herself 
state law says that no member of the governing body of any 
municipality shall vote upon any ordinance order measure 
resolution or proposition in which he may be interested other than 
as a citizen of such municipality 
citing the statute talerico said koon should not be able to 
vote because she would receive a hefty pay increase if elected 
mayor koon is paid 1500 annually as the towns recorder the 
towns mayor receives 10000 annually 
i contend that you lottie koon have an 8500 interest in 
who becomes mayor of westover said talerico who drew a chorus 
of groans hoots and catcalls with the statement 
koon said the secretary of state ruled she had a right to vote 
talerico argued that only the state attorney general could make 
such a ruling koon countered that she had consulted with that 
office too 
the council and koon will try to break the deadlock next monday 
night

iraqs effective use of chemical weapons against 
iran is likely to encourage other countries to acquire them and 
libya and syria probably have already done so according to a 
report released tuesday 
the international institute for strategic studies said israel 
and egypt may also have secret arsenals of nerve agents and other 
chemical weapons 
in its annual survey the londonbased institute also said 
soviet conventional forces remain poised for swift attack with no 
sign of a winding down or switching to defensive positions despite 
talk of change since mikhail s gorbachev took office 
in the past year the numerical superiority of the warsaw pacts 
conventional forces over those of the nato alliance has if 
anything increased the survey said 
but the institute said a raw count of weapons and manpower 
including a 21 warsaw pact advantage in main battle tanks was 
too simplistic to judge which side really has the edge 
the report refused to offer any overall judgment of the state of 
the natowarsaw pact conventional balance 
in longrange nuclear weapons a sixpercent increase by both 
superpowers to some 14600 american and 11700 soviet warheads left 
them equally matched despite this numerical disparity we judge 
that equivalent strategic parity remains said institute deputy 
director col john cross 
the survey was gloomiest about chemical weapons 
it said the soviet union could attack the entire nato area with 
chemical and biological weapons sprayed from aircraft or delivered 
by missiles freefall bombs or artillery shells 
it also indicated that iraqs use of mustard gas and other nerve 
agents likely served as an advertisement particularly in third 
world countries for the weapons which have been condemned 
internationally as inhuman 
the role of chemical warfare in the iraniraq war is more 
likely to be seen as an encouragement to the future use of chemical 
weapons in other regional conflicts than as a discouragement 
the survey said 
institute director francois heisbourg said unless an 
international conference in paris next year bolsters a 1925 
protocol banning chemical weapons in any war more countries will 
acquire them 
the protocol has been undermined by use of chemical weapons in 
the persian gulf war and by iraq using them against kurdish rebels 
this year 
attempts to get a global ban on such weapons are stalled 
unless the authority of the protocol is internationally 
reaffirmed i suspect that other countries which theoretically 
could produce chemical weapons will be tempted to do so said 
heisbourg 
syria and libya are strongly suspected he added egypt 
has used chemical weapons against north yemen in 1966 so there is a 
presumption there while israel is closing no options with the 
perceived syrian threat 
only the united states and the soviet union acknowledge having 
chemical weapons 
but the institute said up to 20 more countries including 
france were suspected of stockpiling or preparing to produce the 
weapons 
the soviet union says it has a 50000ton chemical weapon 
stockpile onesixth of the total estimated by western analysts 
the institute supported the united states resumption last year 
of production of binary weapons separate agents that are lethal 
only when combined saying that without a global ban deterrence 
is the only policy for nato to follow 
on warsaw pactnato conventional forces the survey showed the 
main disparity in battle tanks 22200 nato tanks deployed from the 
atlantic to the urals facing 53000 of the warsaw pact globally 
nato had 33600 tanks and the warsaw pact 68900 compared with 
30500 and 68300 the previous year 
soviet conventional forces exceeded defense needs and were 
configured and deployed in a fashion which favors highspeed 
shortwarning offensive or counteroffensive operations 
meanwhile with only france west germany and italy increasing 
defense spending in western europe nato may be hardpressed to 
maintain its present forces the survey said any significant 
response to us calls for increased european burdensharing seems 
unlikely 
the institute also said argentina and brazil may now be able to 
make nuclear weapons four other officially nonnuclear powers 
india pakistan south africa and israel have long been suspected 
of having atomic weapons or being able to produce them

democrat bruce g sundlun was reluctant 
to take on republican gov edward d diprete again after losing to 
him in a landslide two years ago but now a costly battle over 
ethics has turned the race for governor in the nations tiniest 
state into a surprising cliffhanger 
sundlun a multimillionaire communications executive who lost by 
a 2to1 margin in 1986 has capitalized on news stories about 
diprete family land deals about diprete administration handling of 
a major unfinished bridge project and about state contracts for 
trash hauling and engineering services awarded to diprete campaign 
contributors 
sundlun who said early private polls showed him as much as 50 
points behind has drawn even and surged ahead in some recent 
surveys 
a telephone survey of 400 likely voters conducted for local 
radio and television stations after an oct 10 debate between 
diprete and sundlun showed the race too close to call with sundlun 
receiving 40 percent support and diprete 38 percent well within 
the polls 5 percent margin of error a week earlier sundlun had 
an 11 percentage point lead 
what ive noticed is that neither candidate has made much of 
an inroad into the 15 percent undecided said sundluns campaign 
manager kenneth haupt from what ive seen the undecideds break 
fairly heavily for the challenger they want a change 
i expect finally the last week people will start choosing 
sides 
sundluns support moreover remains soft one poll showed that 
about twothirds of those surveyed said they were voting more 
against diprete than for sundlun 
diprete is striking back at sundlun while trying to steer the 
campaign focus to jobs the economy and education all areas where 
he claims to have brought progress to rhode island 
sundlun said the state has prospered because of new englands 
general economic boom diprete responded that his administration 
positioned the state to take advantage of that boom 
the nov 8 election will be a referendum on the job i have 
done during the past four years diprete who seeks his third 
twoyear term said in closing monday nights second debate between 
the pair 
diprete still is considering an offer of a third televised 
debate on tuesday he received the endorsement of american 
federation of state county and municipal employees which 
represents about 9000 state workers the union cited his fairness 
and accessibility 
sundluns campaign has hammered at the 2 million cranston 
land deal diprete former mayor of cranston denied any 
wrongdoing after cranston officials rezoned a piece of property for 
apartments and dipretes family firm then bought it and sold it the 
same day for a 2 million profit 
but diprete launched a television ad in late september telling 
viewers i sense that some of you may believe that ive let you 
down if this is true then im sorry 
diprete ads charge that sundlun chairman of outlet 
communications inc mismanaged that company to a loss ran 
outlet stores into the ground before selling it to a company 
that later closed the chain and was involved in the executive jet 
aviation scandal of the 1970s that led to the downfall of the penn 
central railroad 
sundlun denies those charges i have seen my reputation sought 
to be destroyed in 30 seconds 30second spots he said 
the barrage of ads and counter ads is costly recent campaign 
finance reports show that in september sundlun spent 577000 
incuding about 90000 per week for televison and radio 
sundlun lent his campaign 495000 during that period and has 
provided most of the 14 million in loans outstanding haupt said 
the campaign had about 10000 left but sundlun was prepared to 
loan more haupt said 
from july through midoctober dipretes campaign reported 
spending more than 1 million including more than 100000 per 
week in television and radio ads beginning in september most of 
his money came from individual and corporate contributions along 
with a 200000 bank loan 
observers agree the race is one of the most expensive in memory 
in this state which has a population of just under 1 million and 
is geographically the nations smallest

american telephone amp telegraph co wants to 
cut its basic interstate longdistance rates by an average of 38 
percent and its business service prices by up to 62 percent to 
reflect savings in local network costs 
the cuts totaling 697 million annually would take effect dec 
1 the day that residential and small business customers begin 
paying an additional 60 cents per month to pay the costs of 
maintaining the local phone network 
atampt estimates that subscribers who make at least 16 a month in 
interstate longdistance calls would offset the addition of the 
subscriber line charge the average residential customer spends 
866 per month on interstate longdistance calls the company 
said those totals do not include intrastate longdistance calls 
as subscribers pay more of the costs to maintain the local 
network longdistance companies pay less the federal 
communications commission requires atampt the nations largest 
longdistance company to send these savings back to consumers by 
lowering rates 
atampts competitors are not required to return these savings to 
customers but the companies have tended to lower their rates in 
response to atampt price cuts 
the two largest competitors mci communications corp and us 
sprint communications co said monday they would review atampts 
plans 
mci spokesman john houser said the company will maintain a 
competitive rate structure and will be passing the access line 
savings along to our customers but he said mci could not be 
specific until it has fully reviewed atampts proposal 
sprint spokesman syd courson said the company wanted to review 
atampts proposed cuts before commenting on its own plans we dont 
know what we will do right now he said 
the price cut if approved by the fcc would be atampts seventh 
since 1984 when the company was stripped of its local operating 
companies by an antitrust decree since then atampts rates have 
fallen 38 percent 
subscribers however pay 260 per month for local network 
costs in a fee called the subscriber line charge which was first 
imposed in 1985 as a way to shift the costs of the local network to 
local customers that charge is scheduled to rise to 320 per 
month on dec 1 
a consumer advocate gene kimmelman of the consumer federation 
of america said he was concerned that atampt has structured its rate 
cut to benefit the companys special discount services designed for 
large users 
as an example he pointed to atampts proposal to cut rates for 
its volume discount plan called reach out america by 49 percent 
but drop basic longdistance rates by only 38 percent 
the 38 percent decrease would apply to basic longdistance 
rates for calls traveling more than 124 miles the decrease would 
be about the same for daytime evening and weekend calling periods 
atampt said 
rates for calls of shorter distances which account for about 
onequarter of atampts interstate calls would be lowered by 11 
percent the company cited the need to maintain acceptable profit 
levels on those shorterdistance calls 
the highest cut would come in rates for atampts software defined 
network service which would drop 62 percent 
wats rates would be cut by 4 percent and atampt would restructure 
the service to bill calls individually based on time and distance 
rather than by the current hourly pricing method this price 
reduction would take effect jan 1 a month later than the others 
rates for atampts three pro wats calling plans for business 
customers would be cut 38 percent overall megacom wats rates 
would drop 47 percent and megacom 800 rates would decrease 48 
percent while basic atampt 800 service prices would go down 4 
percent

dan quayle said tuesday he feels a 
special obligation to help george bush deal with a new generation 
of younger americans and manage inevitable changes in the nations 
economy 
speaking to college students and touring farms in rural 
downstate illinois the republican vice presidential candidate 
spoke of a powerful renewal of change republicans have created 
during the reagan administration 
what is on the new page is dramatic exciting a little scary 
a world of incredible change a world of incredible opportunity 
he said 
quayle spent the day in his brightly festooned bus occasionally 
blaring music from loudspeakers cruising through what he called 
the heartbeat of this country against a backdrop of fall colors 
on a gloomy and chilly day 
at several stops quayle was greeted by knots of protesters 
chanting quayle go home and waving signs but he was cheered by 
crowds at the events 
it is a special obligation for me one which i feel more 
deeply every day to help george bush define the needs of a new 
generation of americans their challenges their responses 
quayle said 
quayle said changes are inevitable in the workplace and the 
economy adding the question is not whether they happen but 
whether we will shape the world through them or they will shape 
us 
he started his campaign day speaking by telephone with bush who 
was in missouri quayle said he hoped at some point that they 
could get together said spokesman david prosperi 
on monday quayle told reporters a joint appearance by the two 
would be a little bit counterproductive 
he stopped tuesday in a halfdozen tiny towns in a comfortably 
outfitted bus stopping occasionally to speak to students dismissed 
briefly from classes 
this campaign is full of controlled spontaneity prosperi 
said 
on his bus quayle relaxed in shirtsleeves giving interviews 
with reporters and waving to spectators while a crew from abcs 
nightline filmed a program about the daily grind of the 
campaign trail 
prosperi said they switched to a bus caravan because the towns 
on tuesdays itinerary were far too small for the campaign 
airplane he added that a suporting role in smalltown america is 
only natural for the no 2 man on the ticket 
with some polls showing quayle a detriment to the gop ticket 
there have been suggestions that campaign strategists are trying to 
keep him out of the limelight prosperi said that wasnt the case 
at one point quayle spoke to hundreds of denimclad youngsters 
on a farm near chrisman sporting a blue future farmers of america 
jacket with his name sewn on the lapel posing before hay bales and 
a giant american flag 
illinois gov james thompson once mentioned as a potential 
running mate for bush before the gop convention last summer came 
along for the day 
this trip today sends a message thompson said george 
bush and dan quayle care about the people who live in and work in 
smalltown america

one of three gray whales trapped nearly 
two weeks by arctic sea ice has pneumonia but biologists say the 
bleeding and battered behemoths should survive at least until a 
risky longshot attempt at freeing them 
an alaska army national guard skycrane helicopter was readied to 
lift off early today from prudhoe bay to tow a 185ton 
hovercrafttype icebreaking barge 200 miles northwest to the 
whales the trip was expected to take from 25 to 40 hours 
mike haller a national guard spokesman said the lift was 
delayed monday while veco inc the oil field service company that 
owns the barge repaired some of the air skirts on the underside of 
the vehicle 
it had been anticipated the operation would get under way about 
11 am edt today but it was delayed by a few hours by midmorning 
alaska time midafternoon edt fueling of the barge and the 
process of rigging the helicopter to the barge were almost 
completed but the barge was still at prudhoe bay 
it took longer to get the barge ready than anticipated 
haller said earlier today the crews worked all night and the 
pilots want to make sure theres as much daylight as possible 
the endangered california gray whales became trapped while 
migrating south to warmer waters the 2430footlong mammals were 
bleeding and battered from continually bashing into the jagged ice 
and were exhausted from swimming against the ocean current to 
remain in place 
the whales were trapped 18 miles northeast of this inupiat 
eskimo village they were only a few hundred feet offshore in 45 
feet of water with their largest ice hole about 10by20 feet 
villagers and biologists used ice picks monday to keep the 
breathing holes open in the 6inch thick ice but subzero 
temperatures threatened to seal them 
ron morris with the national marine fisheries service said he 
and several veterinarians went onto the ice monday to study the 
whales and noticed that one had symptoms of pneumonia 
their condition has worsened since they were first spotted 
morris said one has a little pneumonia but the others are all 
right were being cautiously optimistic 
weve got only one way to go and thats up but theres no 
question in my mind that theyll be here when the vehicle arrives 
the whales ordinarily can stay underwater nearly four minutes 
without air said geoff carroll a north slope borough biologist 
carroll said they have been surfacing about every two minutes 
indicating they were becoming tired and under stress 
biologists said they are surprised the trapped whales have not 
drawn the attention of polar bears and they carried shotguns 
monday night in case the large predators showed up 
they said they were overwhelmed by the interest in the trapped 
whales every year probably dozens of grays drown or are crushed 
by the ice but nobody ever knows about it said biologist craig 
george 
the interest even extended to washington where white house 
spokesman marlin fitzwater said today that president reagan may 
call the people in charge of the whale rescue this afternoon to 
offer moral support 
rescuers raced against onshore winds that threatened to close 
breaks in the ice that would serve as an escape route if the 
icebreaking barge is able to free them 
it was 17 below last night carroll said the thickness of 
the ice is increasing rapidly its growing a matter of inches 
every day 
environmentalists federal authorities and the oil industry have 
joined in the unusual alliance to rush the icebreaking barge to the 
whales so it can crush a narrow path to open water a halfdozen 
miles away 
crews labored around the clock during the weekend and into the 
arctic darkness monday to get the barge and the skycrane ready 
were not going to move that thing until we can make sure 
well have a clean run to barrow said pete leathard a spokesman 
for veco inc an oil field servicing company that owns the barge 
the arctic is not a good place to break down in winter 
plans called for the helicopter to pull the 85by60foot barge 
with an 800foot cable haller said 
the plan has great potential for danger because of the 
altitude of the helicopter in the towing position the nose is 
down he said the danger is that if a line snaps and comes 
back up and gets in the rotors weve got real trouble 
the helicopter which costs 1500 to 3000 an hour to operate 
will trade off with a second skycrane which has been flown to 
prudhoe bay the barge is to carry 20000 gallons of fuel for the 
helicopters and the barge haller said the fuel was provided by 
arco alaska inc 
oil company officials have estimated that that portion of the 
rescue effort could cost as much as 500000 
greenpeace representative cindy lowry arrived here sunday with 
recordings of migrating whales that she wants to play along the ice 
floe to lure the whales to safety 
california grays number about 20000 and have been growing an 
average 25 percent a year for the past decade 
the whales spend their winters in the warm waters off mexico and 
southern california

michael dukakis is trying to bolster his 
organization in vital states by sending dozens of aides from his 
national headquarters into the field and backing them up with more 
than 1300 new volunteers from washington aides said tuesday 
jack corrigan director of operations for the democratic 
campaign said about 60 percent of the workers at the boston 
headquarters are being assigned to target states for the final 
three weeks of the campaign he could not provide a specific number 
among the senior dukakis aides assisting with the drive is 
marcia hale who since the democratic national convention in july 
has been working on plans for a transition to a dukakis presidency 
hale a south carolina native has temporarily delegated her 
transition duties to a deputy and now is focusing from boston on 
southern states in which the democrats believe they are still 
competitive principally georgia and louisiana 
joining the boston operatives being assigned to field operations 
will be more than 1300 new volunteers from washington said wendy 
sherman who runs dukakis headquarters there that group consists 
of congressional aides who have taken leaves numerous attorneys 
with ties to democratic politics and college students from area 
campuses ms sherman said 
its a pretty encouraging sign i think about how strong we 
are going to be in the field on election day corrigan said we 
have a very strong grassroots organization it got us through the 
primaries and it is one of the things that is going to pull us 
through on election day 
volunteers depending on their prior election experience will 
be assigned tasks ranging from political work in target precincts 
to helping with phone banks and distributing leaflets ms sherman 
said 
some of the congressional aides most of whom have worked on 
prior campaigns are being sent back to their home states but many 
also are being assigned to key states she said 
our state party offices are quite capable of running a very 
effective getoutthevote effort but you need bodies to do that 
she said tuesday in a telephone interview this will give us the 
influx of people we need to win on election night 
the congressional recess also will allow the dukakis campaign to 
schedule more appearances by members of congress who have 
volunteered to serve as surrogates for the democratic ticket 
corrigan said 
recent polls have shown dukakis well behind bush but ms 
sherman said party officials calling her office to request more 
volunteers have been relaying a far more optimistic picture 
state party chairs will call and say i know i can win my 
state but im worried about this state or another state she 
said were very encouraged by what were seeing in the states

a grand jury will be asked to review 
the scalding death of a deaf 9yearold girl at a staterun school 
because a prosecutor said hes not convinced her death was 
accidental 
jennifer driggers died last thursday from first and 
seconddegree burns she suffered in a hot shower according to a 
preliminary report issued by medical examiner robert mcconnell he 
ruled the death an accident 
however assistant state attorney steve alexander has taken 
testimony from three paramedics and subpoenaed medical records from 
flagler hospital and the doctor who treated the girl 
you can say accidental accidental accidental but ive not 
been convinced alexander said monday 
officials of the florida school for the deaf and blind said new 
statements from witnesses show the girl slipped in the shower and 
hit her head before being scalded to death 
jeanette gadson 29 the staff member supervising jennifer was 
placed on leave with pay school officials announced monday 
the girls mother robin driggers said she doesnt believe her 
daughter entered the shower on her own because she was terrified of 
hot water and questioned why she didnt get out of the way of the 
hot water 
mcconnell said there was no evidence that anyone else was 
involved in the death although mrs driggers said she thinks her 
daughter may have been held under the water 
earlier school officials reported that the girl ran into the 
shower after becoming ill in the bathroom but on monday assistant 
principal danny hutto said it appeared the girl slipped and banged 
her head when she was hit by the scalding water 
mcconnell said he found a bump on the back of the girls head 
while conducting the autopsy 
the question still remains why did she go into the shower 
and when the water hit her why did she fall back rather than get 
out of the water hutto said 
mrs driggers said the child had twice been previously injured 
at the school the girl was assaulted by a roommate last year and 
fell in the shower at the school in november 1986

hurricane joans 80 mph winds churned across the 
open caribbean today on an unusual southern path that has 
forecasters puzzling over its potential strength and possible 
landfall there was a report that the storm left 50 people dead or 
missing in a town in colombia the day before 
joan is one of a kind said jim gross a meteorologist at 
the national hurricane center you just dont see many hurricanes 
that take this course and hug the coast 
in colombia an official of the state of bolivar in the northern 
part of the country said the storm triggered flooding in the town 
of carmen de bolivar about 360 miles north of the capital of 
bogota 
water roared down three gullies in the town as the storm passed 
monday victor leon mendoza a state government administrator told 
the colombian radio chain rcn 
preliminary reports from the mayors office indicate that 
about 50 persons are dead or missing in the town he said 
at noon edt today joans center was near latitude 111 north 
and longitude 763 west about 70 miles west of the colombian coast 
and about 380 miles east of the island of san andres off the coast 
of nicaragua the hurricane was moving west at 10 mph and was 
expected to continue that motion through today 
panama issued a hurricane watch for its north coast and 
colombia issued a hurricane watch for san andres which is part of 
colombia even though it is located close to nicaragua 
joan the atlantic seasons fifth hurricane is expected to 
bring 4 to 8 inches of rain along its path 
as a tropical storm with 45 mph winds joan slowly built its 
strength as it skimmed colombias coast baffling forecasters who 
had predicted it to weaken 
it reached hurricane force monday night and its center began to 
become better defined a sign the system could intensify over open 
water into the western caribbean forecasters said 
on its present path it would be at least 48 hours before the 
main part of the hurricane reached central america gross said late 
monday 
gross said a strong highpressure system over the northern 
caribbean is keeping joan on its course normally prevailing winds 
and upperlevel atmospheric conditions push tropical storms 
northward as they move from the atlantic said gross 
also he said hurricanes are often sapped of strength in the far 
southern caribbean due to trade winds that push colder deepocean 
water to the surface said gross 
joan became the 10th named storm of the 1988 atlantic hurricane 
season when top winds passed 39 mph on oct 11 hurricane strength 
is 74 mph 
gilbert the most devastating hurricane in recent years left 
more than 300 people dead and caused billions of dollars damage as 
it tore through jamaica the cayman islands and mexicos yucatan 
peninsula last month

income growth in the rust belt 
manufacturing states is staging a comeback after lagging behind the 
national average for most of the 1980s the government said tuesday 
the trend represents an easing in but not an end to a 
phenomenon reagan administration critics have labeled the 
bicoastal economy 
the administration has pointed with pride to the sixyear 
economic recovery the longest during peacetime since the civil 
war however critics say the nations heartland has not shared in 
the expansion 
in a report on nonfarm personal income the commerce department 
said in general states bordering the pacific and atlantic coasts 
continue to have better income growth than the states in between 
but the gap in the growth rates is narrowing 
new england a center of the boom in computer and other 
hightechnology industries still leads the nation in income 
growth from the second quarter apriljune of 1987 to second 
quarter of this year income grew 95 percent compared with 87 
percent average annual growth since the end of the last recession 
in the third quarter of 1982 
new englands growth for both periods was well above the 
national average of 77 percent in the 12 months ending in june 
the latest period for which figures are available and the 71 
percent annual average for 198287 the growth rates are not 
adjusted to remove the effects of consumer price inflation which 
was 4 percent in the 12 months ending in june 
new hampshire and massachussets posted particularly strong 
income gains of 107 percent and 99 percent respectively in the 
latest year available 
but gains in manufacturing have pushed income growth in the 
great lakes states up to average and growth in midatlantic states 
has climbed from the middle ranks to above average 
in the 12 months ending in june growth in the midatlantic 
region led by delaware and new jersey was 87 percent compared 
with 74 percent annual growth in the 198287 period 
growth in the great lakes region which lagged behind during the 
years of the overvalued dollar and exploding trade deficit was 77 
percent in the 12 months ending in june compared with 62 percent 
earlier in the decade 
meanwhile income growth in the far west and the southeast has 
cooled a bit from aboveaverage rates 
the southeast part of the sun belt boom of the early 1980s 
inched down to a 75 percent growth rate from 79 percent in 
198287 the far west cooled to 78 percent in the latest 12 
months down from 82 percent 
the plains states southwest and rocky mountain area all 
dependent on either agriculture mining oil drilling or a 
combination all showed improvement but remain at the bottom of 
the list 
income growth in the plains was 62 percent in the 12 months 
ending in june up from 59 percent earlier in the southwest 58 
percent up from 55 percent and in the rocky mountain area 52 
percent up from 51 percent 
the commerce department attributed gains in the great lakes 
states to strength in the manufacturing of durable goods big 
ticket items expected to last three or more years and in 
construction it said the midatlantic region also benefited from a 
pickup in manufacturing 
economists had been anticipating income gains in the 
manufacturing rust belt of the nation the drop in the value of 
the dollar over the last three years has made us goods less 
expensive on overseas markets and has fueled a boom in export sales 
this year 
in a separate report tuesday the federal reserve board said 
virtually every one of its 12 regional banks were reporting 
continued strength or expansion across a wide range of 
manufacturing industries 
however the report prepared for a nov 1 meeting of fed policy 
makers said manufacturers are becoming less optimistic about 
coming months theyve become more cautious about the first half 
of 1989 following a slight slowdown late this summer the report 
said 
although income growth in the southeast as a whole was down 
according to the commerce department by state it was mixed weak 
growth in incomes from service jobs in georgia and interior states 
more than offset strong growth in the atlantic coast states of 
florida north carolina virginia and south carolina

three azerbaijanis went on trial tuesday on murder 
and arson charges in riots that killed 32 people and highlighted 
ethnic tensions 
the defendants were flown in from the azerbaijani capital of 
baku and taken to the soviet supreme court building in moscow in 
three unmarked gray trucks about two dozen armenians stood 
silently outside the building holding copies of death certificates 
for the victims many of whom were their relatives 
the group later was allowed into the courtroom 
azerbaijanis went on a rampage feb 28 in sumgait an industrial 
city on the caspian sea about 20 miles north of baku they burned 
and looted buildings hunted down armenians and killed them 
official and unofficial reports have said of the 32 victims 26 
were armenians and six were azerbaijanis officials said official 
reports had said more than 200 people were injured but a tass news 
agency dispatch tuesday gave a figure twice as high 
some armenians say the death toll was much higher and have cited 
sumgait as a national tragedy they will never forget 
armenias communist party chief suren arutyunyan said oct 8 
that sumgait was an unhealed wound in peoples souls 
the rioting was sparked by a massive armenian campaign for 
control of the nagornokarabakh district of azerbaijan in addition 
to violence the dispute over the mostly armenian district has 
triggered strikes in the southern republics of azerbaijan and 
neighboring armenia 
the two ethnic groups of the soviet unions more than 100 
nationalities differ in culture and religion 
foreign reporters who waited outside the supreme court building 
were not allowed to attend the trial court officials told the 
reporters they need the permission of the soviet foreign ministry 
but the spokesman for that agency gennady i gerasimov said the 
trial was not open to correspondents gerasimov did not say why 
reporters were barred 
a court official speaking on condition of anonymity identified 
the defendants as ethnic azerbaijanis and gave their names as ahmed 
i akhmedov ilgam a ismailov and yavar g dzhafarov the official 
said each was accused of participating in the murder of one person 
tass said they were charged with organizing and and taking a 
direct part in mass disorders accompanied by pogroms acts of arson 
and murders 
tass quoted a court official as saying dozens of witnesses would 
testify and that the indictment was more than 100 pages long 
the death certificates held by armenians bore pictures of the 
victims and descriptions of how they were murdered many in the 
group wore black and displayed buttons of armenias national flag 
moving the trial to moscow represented a victory for armenian 
activists who had complained that previous legal cases stemming

several house members found themselves in 
ethical or legal trouble during the 100th congress but rep pat 
swindall who was indicted on perjury charges this week is one of 
the few who also is in trouble with the voters 
republican swindall is trailing his democratic challenger ben 
jones by 51 percent to 33 percent in their suburban atlanta 
district according to an oct 1314 poll cited by the democratic 
congressional campaign committee 
by contrast rep harold ford dtenn indicted april 24 1987 
on bank fraud mail fraud and conspiracy charges and still awaiting 
trial has only token opposition in his bid for an eighth house 
term from memphis 
many lawmakers who have been investigated by the house ethics 
committee have encountered little challenge or none at all in 
seeking reelection 
swindall also is unusual because he is the lone republican in a 
sea of problemplagued democrats a circumstance the democratic 
committee attributes to politically motivated complaints of ethics 
violations 
most of these charges are pretty unfounded and the bottom 
line is the voters will reelect these people on the merits of 
their service said committee spokeswoman peggy connolly the 
voters serve as jurors on election day 
swindall 38 was indicted on 10 counts of lying to a grand jury 
investigating a drug moneylaundering scheme swindall says he will 
represent himself at his trial which could begin as early as 
monday and expresses confidence his name will be cleared before 
the nov 8 election 
jones a recovering alcoholic and an actor who played cooter the 
mechanic in the television series dukes of hazzard is taking 
his second shot at swindalls seat he held swindall to 53 percent 
of the vote in 1986 before any of the republican incumbents 
current troubles began 
swindall is the 16th congressman to be indicted in the past 
decade and the third in the current congress after ford and former 
rep mario biaggi dny biaggi resigned after his conviction in 
two unrelated corruption cases but his name will appear on the new 
york ballot as a republican 
numerous other house members were investigated by hill ethics 
panels in the past two years but few if any seem likely to suffer 
negative consequences in the election three weeks away 
last december the house reprimanded rep austin murphy dpa 
for permitting votes to be cast in his name when he was absent 
diverting house resources to his former law firm and putting a 
ghost employee on his payroll but murphy who represents a heavily 
democratic district in western pennsylvania faces only token 
opposition to reelection 
another member democrat charlie rose of north carolina was 
sharply rebuked by the house ethics panel in march for 
borrowing campaign funds for personal use he is expected to win 
reelection easily 
so is house speaker jim wright dtexas the highly visible 
target of an ethics committee investigation triggered by rep newt 
gingrich rga wright has no rival for his fort worth seat 
the ethics panel is investigating six allegations against 
wright including using his office improperly to lobby government 
officials on matters in which he had a financial interest and 
receiving unusually fat royalties from a book published by a 
campaign contractor 
others who were targets of ethics investigations included 
rep ferdinand st germain dri chairman of the house 
banking committee the house ethics panel cleared him of wrongdoing 
last year after a 14month investigation into allegations he had 
used his influence to amass a 2 million fortune in real estate 
investments still pending are allegations that he failed to report 
meals and entertainment paid by a housing industry lobbyist recent 
polls show st germain with a nearly 21 lead over a weak opponent 
rep mary rose oakar dohio she kept an aide on her payroll 
for nearly two years after the aide had moved from washington to 
new york in violation of house rules ms oakar reimbursed the 
government and was not disciplined and she has virtually no 
competition in seeking reelection 
former rep bill boner dtenn the ethics panel said in 
december that boner improperly used campaign funds for a trip to 
hong kong and may have accepted a bribe from a defense contractor 
in the form of 50000 in legal fees paid to his wife but boner 
had already resigned to become mayor of nashville and the panel 
said it no longer had jurisdiction 
in addition at least two congressmen allegedly subjected female 
aides to sexual harassment one of them rep ernie konnyu 
rcalif was the first and only incumbent to lose a primary this 
year the other rep jim bates dcalif is expected to win 
reelection 
rep roy dyson dmd had a rocky year his administrative 
assistant committed suicide after a newspaper reported that the 
aide had required young male staffers to socialize with him and 
dysons ties with defense contractors were scrutinized in 
connection with the pentagon procurement fraud investigation 
dyson has denied any wrongdoing and is running against the same 
republican candidate he steamrollered by a 21 margin in the 1986 
election 
another democrat whose name surfaced in the pentagon inquiry 
rep bill chappell of florida is also expected to coast to an easy 
reelection victory 
rep robert garcia dny who acknowledges he is being 
investigated in connection with the wedtech corruption scandal in 
the bronx also is a safe reelection bet 
rep james traficant dohio is trying to beat the internal 
revenue services demand for 90000 in back taxes from unreported 
bribe income traficant was acquitted after a criminal trial of 
accepting the bribes but the irs insists it is owed the money 
traficants appeal is pending in federal court but he faces no 
problem at the polls 
a nonvoting delegate to congress democrat fofo sunia of 
american samoa resigned this fall after being convicted of payroll 
padding

a priest who has mixed liberal new age 
philosophy with roman catholic doctrine has been sentenced to a 
year of public silence by the vatican according to a published 
report 
the rev matthew fox who has said he wasnt afraid to be 
labeled a heretic will not be permitted to speak publicly or 
publish his writings for a year effective dec 15 according to a 
report in the national catholic reporter a liberal weekly 
newspaper 
fox 47 is the founder of the institute in culture and creation 
spirituality at holy names college in oakland he scheduled a news 
conference for thursday to discuss the vaticans action 
dan lattin a religion writer for the san francisco chronicle 
described foxs curriculum in the papers tuesday editions as 
having a heavy emphasis on christian mysticism feminism and 
environmentalism 
the vatican according to the national catholic reporter has 
ordered holy names college to sever its ties with foxs institute 
school officials said they will issue a statement after foxs news 
conference 
fox has irked conservative catholics by hiring faculty members 
that include a certified masseuse a zen buddhist a yoga teacher 
and a selfdescribed witch named starhawk the story said 
foxs teachings include a book called original blessing that 
criticizes traditional church doctrine for an overemphasis on 
sin and redemption 
when news of a possible vatican investigation was reported in 
1985 fox said he was not upset if people call me a heretic 
joan of arc was condemned burned at the stake and then 
declared a saint the dominican said then 
foxs teachings have been under review by cardinal joseph 
ratzinger whose congregation for the doctrine of the faith ordered 
the rev charles curran dismissed in 1986 from the faculty of 
catholic university in washington dc for doctrinal liberalism 
ratzingers office was once called the holy inquisition 
action against fox could revive tensions between the vatican and 
the us church that surfaced during the curran controversy and 
after rome disciplined liberal seattle archbishop raymond 
hunthausen 
the national catholic reporter said fox will partially defy the 
vatican order by taking a onesemester sabbatical 
this work is just too pressing to be postponed until a 
neurotic papal regime dies out fox was quoted as saying he 
reportedly referred to the vatican action as a compliment it 
shows our influence is growing so much that they feel threatened 
fox has based his writing in part on the ideas of meister 
eckhart a german dominican who died in 1327 and whose teachings 
were condemned as heresy in 1329 by pope john xxii 
fox has denied his creation spirituality is the same as 
pantheism the belief that everything is god and god is everything 
pantheism is considered heresy by the catholic church 
foxs institute which he founded in mundelein college in 
chicago in 1978 and moved to oakland in 1983 offers a masters 
degree in spirituality and has instructed scores of priests and 
nuns

a federal panel called tuesday for universal 
access to prenatal care by american women as a way to reduce the 
number of babies born diseased and handicapped and save a lot of 
taxpayer dollars in the process 
the most basic problem is that our nation has failed to give 
adequate priority to the principle that all pregnant women not 
only the affluent should receive prenatal delivery and 
postpartum services said joyce c lashof chairwoman of the 
institute of medicine study committee 
the panels twoyear survey started out trying to determine what 
type of outreach programs would be most effective in providing 
pregnant woman with prenatal care 
but it soon concluded that the problem ran deeper than women not 
being aware of services available to them 
our central conclusion is that outreach efforts are no match 
for the pervasive barriers faced by lowincome women in trying to 
secure adequate prenatal and maternitycare services lashof said 
at a news conference where the 254page report was issued 
as is so often the case the principal barrier is money 
said lashof who is dean of the school of public health at the 
university of californiaberkeley 
the report said about 26 percent of women of childbearing age 
have no insurance public or private to cover maternity care and 
that twothirds of these or about 95 million women have no 
health insurance at all 
in many ways the panelists concluded money itself is not as 
much of a problem as lack of will to make a national commitment to 
tackle the problem in a comprehensive way 
although there would be an initial investment of new funds to 
expand medicaid to cover more pregnant women for example the 
money would pay a threefold dividend by producing more healthy 
babies and thus fewer sick and handicapped ones to care for at 
public expense 
for every dollar spent on prenatal care for lowincome poorly 
educated women about 3 are saved in medical expenses for 
lowbirthweight babies during the first year of life said 
lashof citing figures from a 1985 institute of medicine study 
indeed many of the fundamental findings in the new survey track 
two studies released in recent months by the congressional office 
of technology assessment and the national commission to prevent 
infant mortality 
lashof said the major new conclusion of the latest study is that 
trying to refine outreach programs for women in need of prenatal 
care is more or less wasted effort until actual barriers to such 
care are removed 
a majority of the six panelists at the news conference expressed 
optimism that the nation will provide proper prenatal care in the 
near future in part because multiple studies seem to have 
demonstrated beyond doubt the sheer cost effectiveness of such 
programs 
if anything gets attention its dollars and cents said 
panelist george m ryan i just dont think this nation is going 
to go on paying to take care of handicapped infants when we can 
prevent the handicaps with proper prenatal care 
ryan is an obstetrics and gynecology professor at the university 
of tennessee medical school in memphis 
the panel was blunt in its conclusion that the time has come to 
act rather than study the problem to death 
the committee specifically urges that no more research be 
conducted to demonstrate the importance of financial and other 
institutional barriers to care the report said

ohio gov richard celeste demanded tuesday 
that president reagan shut down a governmentowned uranium 
processing plant until something is done to stop the radioactive 
pollution it produces 
the us department of energy admitted friday at a congressional 
committee hearing in washington that the government has known of 
dangerous environmental problems at the feed materials production 
center since it was established in 1951 celeste said 
the governor said he wrote a letter to reagan demanding that the 
plant located in fernald about 18 miles northwest of cincinnati 
be closed the plant processes uranium for use in nuclear weapons 
which are made elsewhere 
this admission of deceit and mismanagement confirms and 
emphasizes what we have known in ohio for a long time this 
facility is an environmental disaster threatening the health and 
safety of thousands of ohioans celeste wrote 
the letter demands that the energy department which owns the 
plant pay for an independent evaluation of plant employees and 
nearby residents to determine how their health has been affected 
the governor also said the department should treat and stabilize 
radioactive thorium at the plant begin a final cleanup of 
radioactive waste stored in two deteriorating concrete silos and 
start identifying the contents of 200000 containers of waste that 
have accumulated as a result of what the governor said is the 
departments negligent management of the plant 
celeste and richard shank director of the ohio environmental 
protection agency said they believe the plant has been better 
managed since westinghouse materials co of ohio took over its 
operation in january 1986 but they said they are concerned about 
more than 30 years of radioactive emissions into the atmosphere and 
into the water table 
the energy department admitted in january 1985 that faulty 
exhaust air filters at the plant had allowed the release of at 
least 200000 pounds of radioactive uranium oxide dust into the 
atmosphere during the past three decades including at least 3000 
pounds from 1980 to 1985 
five people who live near the plant then filed a 300 million 
classaction lawsuit alleging that the former operator national 
lead co was negligent in failing to prevent the uranium releases 
and that the releases contaminated property and may have caused 
health and personal injuries 
the lawsuit is pending in us district court in cincinnati 
the energy department prompted the new furor by admitting in 
court documents that government officials had been aware of 
potential environmental problems at the plant but still directed 
national lead managers to proceed with uranium processing 
the state sued the energy department in 1985 charging it with 
polluting the environment at the 1050acre site that lawsuit also 
is pending in us district court 
celeste said the state which tried to negotiate with the energy 
department for a cleanup received no cooperation until the lawsuit 
was filed 
when ohios concern about conditions at the facility led the 
state to attempt to become involved the door was repeatedly 
slammed in our faces essentially we have been told that this 
major threat to public health and safety is none of our business 
celeste said in the letter 
james reafsnyder the energy departments site manager declined 
comment tuesday and referred queries to spokeswoman gail bradshaw 
in washington she was unavailable for calls 
pat weber a white house spokeswoman for reagan said the energy 
department already has begun what is billed as a 500 million 
decadelong project to clean up and modernize the plant

a 26yearold woman has been sentenced 
to 30 days in jail for embezzling almost 5000 to pay for her 
wedding to a sheriffs deputy because she wanted to look better 
than her sister did 
kelly susan horton was sentenced monday after pleading guilty 
aug 28 to embezzling 4870 from what was then american national 
bank in plainwell where she worked as a teller horton used the 
money to pay for her wedding in august 1985 according to court 
records 
us district judge richard enslen also ordered horton to pay 
full restitution to her creditors 
this isnt the worst crime ive ever seen enslen said 
but its the shallowest 
you say that what you wanted was to look as good as your 
sister or better enslen said your father had already 
contributed money that he probably did not have and you repaid that 
kindness by stealing 
because hortons husband ken horton is an allegan county 
sheriffs deputy she will serve her sentence in the kalamazoo or 
kent county jail 
horton declined to comment on his wifes sentence 
you knew that your husband was a law enforcement officer but 
it wasnt important to you that he might be embarrassed enslen 
said what a terrible crime to commit 
asked by enslen if she had anything to say for herself before he 
sentenced her horton cried im sorry then began weeping 
and could not continue 
my client has had lots of physical and emotional problems due 
to this circumstance said earl dalzell the womans attorney 
what she did was obviously wrong and she knows that 
according to court records among the items horton purchased 
with the embezzled money were a wedding dress veil that cost 300 
wedding invitations that cost 200 a wedding cake that cost 150 
and a band for the reception for 500

the us forest service has raided a key 
reforestation trust fund to cover more than 500 million in 
firefighting expenses over the past two years and the agencys 
budget director said tuesday hes not sure where the money will 
come from if next summer is a bad fire season 
the problem is where are we going to get funds to fight fires 
in 1989 said john leasure 
leasures comments came as an oregon congressman on tuesday 
introduced legislation that would create a special fund to cover 
the forest services firefighting expenses 
democratic rep peter defazio said that under his bill half of 
the agencys reciepts from timber sales in national forests and 
other fees would be deposited in the special emergency fire 
fighting trust fund money left in the fund after the firefighting 
costs were paid would be turned over to the us treasury 
as it is now the potential for disaster is immense said 
defazio we might not have money for reforestation or to fight 
fires the present system just isnt working 
the forest service has traditionally sought only a token amount 
for firefighting costs in its annual budget the agency would 
borrow from one of its other accounts if more money was needed and 
then ask congress later for additional funding to repay the account 
defazio said however that a budget agreement between congress 
and the reagan administration essentially eliminated the 
possibility of any supplemental appropriations and that any effort 
to secure additional funding to cover firefighting costs could 
trigger the automatic budget cuts established under the 
grammrudman act 
its a mess said defazio 
recently the forest service has been borrowing heavily from the 
socalled knutsenvanderberg trust fund fees timber operators pay 
when they log in the national forest are deposited in that fund and 
the money is earmarked for reforestation projects 
over the past two years the kv fund has been drawn down from a 
high of about 800 million to a current level of about 120 
million leasure said 
collections from the timber harvesters during the current fiscal 
year should add between 175 million to 200 million to the kv 
fund or barely enough to cover the cost of reforestation projects 
we dont expect any difficulties paying for reforestation in 
fiscal 1989 but its obvious the trust fund has been drawn down 
to just operating levels said leasure 
leasure said the administration had yet to review defazios 
legislation but admitted the entire issue of paying for 
firefighting costs and reforestation was an issue of concern to 
us and many people 
defazio said that it is well past time for the forest service to 
make the books honest the kv fund is not a deep pocket it is 
the kv fund which keeps the forest service timberlands renewable 
they will not be renewable if we rob the fund 
leasure said that a total of 508 millon was taken from the kv 
fund to pay for 400 million in firefighting costs this year and 
108 million from last year 
even tough congress recently appropriated 125 million for 
firefighting leasure said the forest fire season particularly in 
california is not over

michael dukakis pledged tuesday to wipe 
out the nations 150 billion trade deficit in four years and 
lashed out at george bush as a man with no convictions no ideas 
and no plans 
dukakis drew enthusiastic crowds at stops in michigan as aides 
contended the race is closer than indicated by polls pointing to a 
big democratic defeat he depicted the election as a choice between 
one candidate who will stand up for average americans and one who 
is the champion of the welltodo 
george bush cares about the people on easy street i care 
about the people on main street he said in a speech on the 
university of western michigan campus 
with the poll news ranging between bad and worse dukakis and 
his aides have been seeking a spark to ignite his faltering 
campaign one woman in his university audience did her best to 
oblige 
the democratic candidate had just finished saying the 
difference between george bush and me boils down to this when she 
loudly interrupted youre real and hes not 
at that michigan gov jim blanchard jumped out of his seat on 
the stage behind dukakis and pumped his fist up and down 
energetically and exhorted lets go while the audience cheered 
enthusiastically 
for one day at least dukakis and his candidacy seemed to be 
generating enthusiasm lacking since last thursdays poorly reviewed 
debate performance from blanchards cheerleading to crowd chants 
of duke duke duke 
in saginaw he declared that bush wants to help those who have 
it made i want to help every american family make it 
dukakis said bush and the reagan administration have done 
nothing to solve the root causes of the 1987 stock market plunge 
which occurred one year ago wednesday 
weve got to end the republican rainbow coalition of red ink 
for our children pink slips for our workers greenmail for sharp 
operators on wall street and golden parachutes for top corporate 
executives he added 
dukakis moved through a threecity tour in michigan with 
statewide polls showing him trailing in the race for the states 20 
electoral votes his aides seemed far more concerned though about 
an nbcwall street journal survey showing a 5538 bush lead 
nationally 
senior aides told reporters at every turn as they did on 
monday that they do not believe the poll they said other surveys 
show much smaller margins 
dukakis first speech of the day produced noticeably sharper 
rhetoric along with his announcement of a goal of eliminating the 
trade defitic 
he said in four years the reagan administration had created the 
worlds largest trade deficit and cost our workers five million 
jobs 
dukakis said he would meet his goal of eliminating the trade 
deficit by reducing the budget deficit increasing foreign trade 
investing in education and training and putting more emphasis on 
research and development 
how about world hunger was the skeptical retort by bush 
spokeswoman sheila tate when told of the democrats promises 
dukakis added and were going to give industries that have 
been battered by mr bushs reckless policies the breathing space 
they need to retool with new technologies and compete with new 
skills 
dukakis scorned bushs approach to the same problem 
well hes got the flags and balloons but no convictions no 
ideas and no plans dukakis said 
he said his republican rival doesnt want to talk about his 
plans and said maybe its because he hasnt got the vaguest 
ideas how to end the trade deficit how to rebuild out heartland 
and how to revive main street

healthy people on a typical american diet may 
have to look no further than their salad dressing for benefits that 
some people are seeking from fish oil capsules agriculture 
department scientists said tuesday 
chemist edward a emken of the departments agricultural 
research service said the human body rapidly converts a part of the 
soybean oil used in some ordinary food products into the same kinds 
of fatty acids found in fish oil 
two men in a preliminary study consumed the soybean oil 
component linolenic acid and within a few hours their bodies had 
coverted it into the same omega3 fatty acids found in fish and 
marine oil emken said 
think of it this way the body can naturally make its own fish 
oil omega3 fatty acids from the linolenic acid in soybean oil 
he said in a report released by the usda agency 
the report said capsules of fish and marine oils have been 
touted by advertisers and debated by nutrionists as dietary 
supplements in any case the capsules it said have become 
popular with any consumers hoping to ease or prevent conditions 
ranging from heart disease to rheumatoid arthritis 
emken led the study at the agencys northern regional research 
center at peoria ill and was helped in the work by st francis 
medical center in peoria 
our study is the first to show that linolenic acid is rapidly 
converted to omega3 fatty acids found in marine oil emken said 
the study also provides direction for further research to learn 
which dietary fatty acids including those in fish and soybeans 
best meet human nutritional needs 
soybean oil is the only major domestic vegetable oil that 
contains much linolenic acid and makes up 79 percent of the 
vegetable fats in the average us diet the report said the fats 
are in such foods as shortening margarine and cooking oil as well 
as in salad dressing

one of the decisive factors in irans decision 
to accept a ceasefire with iraq was a prediction by the radical 
revolutionary guards that they could not achieve any victory over 
the iraqis until 1993 according to a document released tuesday 
the peoples mujahedeen of iran a group seeking to overthrow 
the government of ayatollah ruhollah khomeini released what it 
said was a transcript of a july 17 meeting at which the decision to 
adopt a ceasefire was announced to the senior iranian leadership 
the detailed transcript sheds light on the iranian decision 
which has not been publicly explained and has led to much 
speculation 
the authenticity of the document could not be independently 
verified but previous documents released by the organization have 
proved generally reliable 
now that our military officials openly admit that the army 
of islam will not achieve any victories whatsoever in the near 
future i accept the ceasefire said khomeini in a message to 
the gathering read by his son ahmad 
the ailing leader did not take part in the eighthour meeting 
which was attended by some 40 people including parliament speaker 
hashemi rafsanjani president ali khamenei prime minister hussein 
musavi and senior military officers 
in his message khomeini cited specifically the shocking 
letter of the guards corps commander mahsen rezaij who sought to 
continue the eightyear war 
we wont have any victories in the next five years khomeini 
reportedly quoted the commander as saying after 1993 if we have 
250 brigades 2500 tanks 3000 armored personnel carriers 300 
aircraft and 300 helicopters we believe god willing we will be 
able to launch offensives the letter reportedly said 
diplomatic sources have said iran chronically short of money 
and isolated by an international embargo was suffering severe 
shortages of combat aircraft tanks radar and other weapons 
khomeini also said his governments bank accounts are below 
zero and the people have no desire to go the fronts 
in his address to the iranian people on july 20 announcing the 
ceasefire khomeini did not explain his reasons for what he said 
was a very bitter and tragic issue for everyone 
in a series of iraqi offensives earlier this year iran lost 
virtually all the territory it had captured in the eightyear war 
rafsanjani described to the participants several iranian losses 
citing the battle on majnoon island in which he said iranian forces 
retreated without suffering any casualties leaving 70 boats for 
the enemy he said supplies were so low that iranian forces didnt 
even have sandbags 
other officials spoke of confusion within the military the 
deterioration of the economy and an energy shortage the transcript 
also recorded a harsh exchange between khomeinis son and interior 
minister ali akbar mohtashami who criticized the ceasefire 
decision 
but khomeinis son defended his father one day he said war 
now he says peace tomorrow once again he might advocate war 
theres no contradiction in this

the president of the world jewish congress said 
tuesday the east germans have agreed to accept moral responsibility 
and pay reparations for the nazi extermination of 6 million jews 
but he would not give specifics 
edgar m bronfman also said he hoped for better relations 
between east germany and israel which have never recognized each 
other diplomatically i have been given the understanding that 
serious consideration is being given to some renewal of 
relationship he said 
bronfman 59 spoke to reporters at the end of a threeday visit 
to east germany that included meetings with erich honecker 
president and communist party chief foreign minister oskar 
fischer and other officials 
before meeting honecker bronfman said he expected a reparations 
agreement east germany had said it would provide unspecified 
humanitarian aid to holocaust victims 
i have had very good clear meetings here bronfman told the 
news conference in east berlin i am totally satisfied on two 
counts the first is the moral position that east germany is 
taking on its responsibilities on the holocaust the second point 
is payment to the sufferers and survivors 
he also referred to an international claims conference supported 
by the world jewish conference which in the past has handled 
reparations issues for holocaust victims 
i understand that the negotiations that took place between the 
east german government and the claims conference have been 
completed bronfman said they will be lived up to and the 
details and communications will be worked out and reported 
i am completely satisifed with the results i have nothing 
further to say on the payments question it is not my 
responsibility to discuss the details 
bronfman was asked about a statement by heinz galinski a west 
german jewish leader that east germany would pay up to 100 
million and replied the 100 million was not part of my 
mission 
east germany has a chronic shortage of hard currency and has not 
been expected to make substantial payments but any offer of 
reparations would be a major change from its previous policy 
it has claimed since its founding in 1949 that it bears no 
responsibility for hitlers atrocities because it was created after 
world war ii and has stressed that communists also suffered under 
nazi persecution 
west germany has paid more than 48 billion to holocaust victims 
and their relatives since it signed a compensation agreement with 
the world jewish congress in 1952 
in recents months east german official media have reported 
government efforts to improve relations with practicing jews in 
east germany who number only 450600 
about east german pledges to renovate and maintain jewish 
synagogues and cemeteries bronfman said tuesday im very 
satisfied with the symbolic arrangements 
the official east german news agency adn covered the visit 
extensively and reported bronfmans remarks on the talks between 
the claims conference and honeckers government a frontpage story 
in the communist party daily neues deutschland was accompanied by a 
photograph of bronfman and honecker shaking hands

president roh taewoo of south korea 
called tuesday for a summit meeting with north koreans president 
to sign a nonaggression pact and said his country will never use 
force first against the north 
in the first address by a korean leader to the general assembly 
roh said such a summit should resolve all the problems raised by 
either or both sides with regard to disarmament arms control and 
other military matters 
north korea has said it only would accept a summit meeting after 
42000 us troops pull out of the south 
roh also proposed the two koreas meet with united states the 
soviet union china and japan to lay the groundwork for peace 
prosperity and security in northeast asia 
seouls allies including the united states should contribute 
to the progress and opening of north korea by engaging pyongyang in 
expanding relations the president told the 159member world body 
roh also called for a korean trade and cultural center on the 
38th parallel dividing north and south where divided families 
could visit in a city of peace 
western diplomats hailed rohs speech which drew prolonged 
applause but there was no immediate comment from north korea the 
soviet union or china 
ambassador pak gil yon of north korea was present in the 
assembly chamber but left without speaking to reporters 
in pyongyang president kim il sung accused south korea and the 
united states on tuesday of maneuvering to perpetuate the 
division of the korean peninsula the official korean central news 
agency said 
the agency monitored in tokyo said kim spoke at a banquet 
several hours before rohs un speech kim again urged peace and 
the removal of us troops 
roh in his speech said improved relations and trust between 
the two koreas could ultimately lead to the reunification of the 
peninsula divided since world war ii 
even before a nonaggression declaration is made with the 
northern side the republic of korea will never use force first 
against the north roh said 
we must do everything possible to hasten the coming of the 
springtime for peace and reconciliation on the korean peninsula 
he said 
us ambassador vernon a walters the permanent un 
representative praised the speech as one of the most historic 
and statesmanlike speeches i have heard in this hall 
japanese ambassador hideo kagami said we hope very much that 
todays speech will contribute to dialogue reduction of tensions 
and reconciliation 
on wednesday north koreas deputy foreign minister kang sok 
ju will address the world body 
the appearance of the south korean president and north korean 
deputy foreign minister is the result of a compromise the united 
states japan canada and other nations proposed last summer that 
south korea should speak on the 40th anniversary of its 1948 
founding 
china the soviet union and other socialist nations opposed the 
idea saying a speech to observe one national day only would fan 
tensions since the korean peninsula was divided 
it later was decided both sides would speak separately on the 
question of reconciliation and dialogue 
the two koreas hold un nonvoting observer status because 
their peninsula is divided and they still technically are at war 
the 19501953 korean war ended in an armistice and no peace treaty 
was signed 
on thursday roh meets president reagan in washington

israels supreme court barred usborn rabbi 
meir kahane on tuesday from running in the nov 1 election calling 
his antiarab kach movement racist 
the unanimous ruling was expected to benefit the rightwing 
likud bloc of prime minister yitzhak shamir in its close race with 
the leftleaning labor party 
an angry kahane speaking at a news conference urged backers to 
boycott the vote one agitated activist tore up his israeli 
indentification card needed for voting scuffled with bystanders 
and was dragged out of the room 
the court also ruled the progressive list for peace which calls 
for an independent palestinian state could compete in the 
elections the likud had demanded the partys ouster for allegedly 
seeking to destroy israels jewish character 
in its unanimous ruling on kach the court found that kahane 
incites racism and negates the democratic character of the 
state 
the 56yearold brooklyn nyborn founder of the militant 
jewish defense league demands the ouster of all arabs from 
israeliheld territory and a ban on jewisharab marriages the 
movements symbol is a clenched fist inside a star of david 
the court ruled on a kach appeal against a decision by the 
central elections committee to bar the movement from the elections 
the decision was based on a 1985 law banning parties advocating 
racism and opposing israels jewish or democratic character 
but kahane said there was a contradiction between zionism and 
democracy noting that israels law of return discriminates 
against nonjews by granting automatic citizenship only to jews 
he spoke during a chaotic news conference that was repeatedly 
interrupted by supporters chanting kahane king of israel 
kahane urged supporters to boycott the elections saying he 
wanted to punish likud which had joined labor in supporting kachs 
ouster from the race 
kahane won a seat in the 120member parliament in 1984 after 
three failed attempts 
analysts said many kach supporters would probably ignore the 
boycott call and support the extreme rightwing parties tsomet and 
moledet instead of likud 
shamir said tuesday his party would not make a special appeal to 
kach voters but even if potential kach voters switch to other 
rightwing parties likud would benefit because potential coalition 
partners would be strengthened 
the supreme court meanwhile rejected demands by likud and the 
rightwing tehiya party that the progressive list for peace should 
be barred from the election because it allegedly seeks to destroy 
israels jewish character by negotiating with the palestine 
liberation organization 
likud and tehiya first challenged the plp in the elections 
committee and then took their case to the supreme court 
also tuesday shamir told reporters that the struggle of 
palestinians to achieve independence was useless and that there 
would never be a palestinian state 
likuds campaign platform published tuesday suggested that 
shamir would annex the occupied territories if elected 
israel has a right and a claim to sovereignty over judea 
samaria and the gaza district the platform read using the 
biblical names for the west bank israel will raise this claim 
and act toward implementing this right

leftist students occupied the downtown 
campus building of an independent usaffiliated college tuesday 
to protest private education 
education isnt for sale its for everyone chanted the 
more than 1000 students who also burned a us flag from the 
balcony of the building housing a department of southeastern 
college 
no private university should be allowed to operate here we 
must struggle to safeguard the public character of our education 
system if we want to strengthen our studies the protesters said 
in a statement 
all levels of education in greece including books and 
accomodation are statefunded although more than 100 private 
primary and secondary schools also operate 
some independent higher education institutions also exist but 
degrees gained at private colleges are not recognized by the 
socialist government 
these people feel that private american education doesnt have 
the right to exist in greece because they complain that it creates 
a kind of elite said achilles kanellopoulos dean of 
southeastern college 
theyre wrong as many of our students who cannot afford the 
fees receive financial aid he said

president reagan telephoned the commander of a 
whale rescue operation in alaska on tuesday to offer his support 
telling him that americans hearts are with you and our prayers 
are also with you in the effort to save three mammals trapped by 
ice in the arctic sea 
reagan in a fiveminute call to col tom carroll of the alaska 
army national guard said he was very concerned about the 
plight of the mammals and wanted an onsite report from alaska 
the conversation was piped into the white house press room 
the endangered california gray whales became trapped 18 miles 
northeast of barrow alaska while migrating south to warmer 
waters the 24to30footlong mammals were bleeding and battered 
from continually bashing into the jagged ice for nearly two weeks 
reagan said he had monitored the situation by watching 
television 
i just wanted to tell you that everybody down here their 
hearts are with you and our prayers are also with you he told 
carroll who was at a base camp at prudhoe bay alaska about 200 
miles southeast of the whales 
anything that we can say or do to help you along with the 
success of the operation wed be pleased to do it the president 
added 
carroll explained to the president details in the planned 
operation in which a national guard skycrane helicopter was to tow 
a 185ton hovercrafttype icebreaking barge from prudhoe bay to 
the whales 
the operation was delayed for several hours because the owner 
wanted to make sure it was totally safe to operate in the harsh 
environment carroll said 
he said that while the national guard is coordinating the 
operation private companies and groups such as greenpeace and the 
national marine fisheries service are also involved 
its extremely moving when you see the interest that has been 
generated not only here but across the nation carroll said 
he added that reagans call was a moralebooster for the crews 
working in subfreezing weather 
this is the kind of thing that kind of makes it all 
worthwhile he said but the big moment will come when the whales 
are safe he added

the disease aids could claim 50 million lives 
throughout the world in the 1990s exceeding the toll of the black 
plague in the middle ages according to the world future society 
the aids prediction was the grimmest of scores of forecasts by 
the society in the novemberdecember edition of its magazine the 
futurist it said millions of americans may become ill with aids 
at an economic cost to the nation of 66 billion even though the 
disease whose chief victims have been homosexual men and 
intravenous drug users is not likely to spread rapidly within the 
heterosexual population 
the world health organization estimates that as many as 10 
million people worldwide may be infected with aids with 1 million 
new cases possible by 1993 as of oct 10 aids had been diagnosed 
in 75437 americans of whom more than half or 42432 have died 
since june 1 1981 according to the centers for disease control 
no one is known to have recovered from aids 
on the positive side the world future society foresees better 
living conditions both at home and on the job technology will help 
more americans live in dream houses with home theaters 
housekeeping robots and backyard edens it said it predicted 
employers will offer more familyoriented benefits including 
onsite child care flexible working hours and time off to care for 
sick children 
the predictions summarize a wide range of reports published 
during the past year by the society a nonprofit educational group 
based in bethesda md which encourages research into issues 
affecting the future 
it predicted a continued rebirth of inner cities with a trend 
toward more greenery in downtown areas and an interspersing of 
entertainment and cultural facilities such as art museums and 
aquariums within shopping areas 
the society said the aids epidemic could have some positive 
effects if it leads to national health insurance systems and 
promotes a boom in medical research that could benefit all areas of 
health care 
other projections 
the economic rivalry between the united states and japan could 
lead to serious trade wars and security differences japanese 
control of the most advanced semiconductor technology by the 1990s 
could further erode us economic strength 
computer networks and telecommunications facilities including 
those operated by the military will become popular targets for 
terrorists 
businesses will need to provide continuous employee training as 
the automation and computer revolutions eliminate many lowliteracy 
jobs 
fraud may become the crime of choice in the future as america 
grows older replacing burglary which requires the agility of 
youth 
new discoveries in biotechnology and generic engineering could 
lead to the replacement of nerve cells arteries hormoneproducing 
cells and even brain cells artificial implants will become more 
common 
if current trends continue the united states will face a 
shortage of 12 million nurses by the year 2000

the nations factories are booming thanks to 
strong export sales but a slight slowdown late this summer has 
left manufacturers cautious about next year the federal reserve 
board said tuesday 
manufacturers are becoming less optimistic about coming 
months despite current strength the federal reserve said in a 
review of the economy based on reports from its 12 regional banks 
the report lends new weight to the prevailing view of economists 
that the fed will refrain from pushing interest rates higher at 
least until after the nov 8 elections and possibly until early 
next year 
virtually every district indicates continuing strength or 
expansion in the industrial sector many cite rising exports as a 
primary source of demand said the fed report known internally 
as the tan book 
the expansion encompasses a wide range of industries including 
chemicals paper and pulp steel autos and trucks and machinery 
it said 
however it added several districts say a slight slowdown 
became evident in late summer and that manufacturers forseeing a 
levelingoff of activity through the first half of 1989 have 
become very cautious 
the report will be used as a starting point for discussions when 
fed policymakers gather on nov 1 to map monetary strategy 
manufacturing aided by an export boom fueled by the lower value 
of the dollar has led economic growth this year but demand has 
been so strong that analysts have worried it will cause production 
bottlenecks and higher prices 
in an effort to fight inflation by curbing demand the fed 
pushed up interest rates from late march through early august 
reports from the district banks prompted the boards most dramatic 
move on aug 9 it raised a key bank lending rate the discount 
rate from 6 percent to 65 percent 
the central bank has refrained from further tightening moves 
since then waiting to see if economic growth slows to what it 
considers a sustainable noninflationary pace 
in other economic sectors the report found 
the summer drought will have a much smaller impact on farm 
income than was originally thought a fall in crop yields has 
been largely offset by higher prices and federal aid to farmers 
retail trade particularly womens clothing is weak or slow 
in most areas however car sales have been strong in most 
districts 
the decline in oil prices has hurt the dallas area which 
reported a 14 percent decline in oil wells since may the impact 
has been less severe in other areas 
most districts reported weaker housing construction as builders 
anticipate higher interest rates two districts atlanta and st 
louis noted softening home prices although business lending is 
strong mortgage lending has tapered off

president reagan on tuesday signed with 
reservations a house resolution calling for the withdrawal of 
vietnamese troops from cambodia and establishment of a free and 
independent government in that country 
reagan said he welcomed this clear statement of principles 
on cambodia but he disagreed with certain clauses which he feared 
could complicate efforts to ensure that khmer rouge rebels never 
again attain power 
the house resolution stipulates that the cambodian people be 
protected from the return of a khmer rouge who under pol pot in 
the late 1970s are thought to have slaughtered as many as 2 
million people 
reagan did not specify his reservations but a white house 
official said the presidents main problem was language in the 
resolution which didnt conform exactly to us policy 
the united states wants a withdrawal of vietnamese troops in the 
context of an overall settlement in cambodia said the 
official speaking on condition he not be named the resolution did 
not mention the overall settlement he said 
reagan however said he signed the nonbinding resolution 
because it makes clear that the united states will continue to do 
everything possible to assure that the vietnamese occupation of 
cambodia is brought to an end and that effective guarantees are put 
into place to prevent the khmer rouge from ever again taking 
control of cambodia 
vietnam which has installed a puppet government in cambodia 
announced earlier this year that it would withdraw its 120000 
troops from the nearby country by 1990 
the withdrawal however will leave a vaccuum the united states 
provides nonlethal assistance to two noncommunist groups 
including one headed by prince norodom sihanouk the former chief 
of state sihanouk met last week with reagan

a mechanic on tuesday became the first 
person arraigned for allegedly violating floridas new law banning 
obscene bumper stickers and the american civil liberties union 
said it might challenge the statutes constitutionality 
glenn wallace beasley 24 pleaded innocent to the seconddegree 
misdemeanor in collier county court he also pleaded innocent to 
several other misdemeanor traffic and parole violations 
if beasley is convicted of violating the obscenity statute 
which took effect oct 1 he could face up to six months in jail 
and a 500 fine penalties double for repeated violations 
with or without the aclus help his attorney said he will ask 
a judge to dismiss the obscenity charge 
my gut reaction is i dont think its constitutional said 
assistant public defender phillip roach in naples it gives the 
arresting police officer total discretion to decide whats 
obscene 
beasley was picked up friday night in what apparently was the 
first application of the law passed this spring rep tom banjanin 
proposed the ban because of a proliferation of stickers like the 
one spotted on beasleys truck 
it sported a popular but scatological version of the saying 
things happen 
charlene carres a lobbyist with the aclu in tallahassee said 
she would consult with the groups headquarters in new york about 
intervening in the case 
she noted that the us supreme court set precedent on the issue 
of obscenity in the 1960s in a california case in which a draft 
protester wearing a tshirt denigrating the selective service was 
arrested after he walked into a courthouse 
the high court ruled that the tshirts slogan was protected 
under first amendment rights of free speech because it pertained to 
the government 
i suspect there could be an action brought carres said i 
dont see a difference between a tshirt and a bumper sticker 
state rep art simon who helped draft the bumper sticker ban 
said the new law simply adds bumper stickers to other forms of 
printed and recorded media already covered by state obscenity laws 
and leaves to the courts to define what obscenity means 
simon said he wasnt surprised that the law is headed for a 
challenge but questioned how much the california case would help 
beasley 
one is going to be hardpressed to make an analogous argument 
that something which is a normal bodily function is in and of 
itself an expression of political belief said simon an 
attorney i think we have regulated the subject matter to the 
fullest extent allowed under the constitution and now it will 
require a casebycase analysis 
state attorney joseph dalessandro of collier county said he 
didnt think beasleys case would make a good test for civil 
libertarians because of the other traffic charges filed against him 
he predicted beasley would end up entering a plea bargain on 
those charges 
in the meantime the prosecutor isnt making clean bumpers a 
priority in collier county 
the police arent really going out and instructing their 
people to start making arrests for bumper stickers he said 
a spokesman for the sheriffs office said that while the statute 
may not generate a lot of prosecutions based only on bumpersticker 
charges it will provide officers with another reason to stop 
suspicious vehicles 
its going to be a tool for the officer if theyve got the 
obscene stickers its one more probable cause to stop 
somebody said lt steve riley

architects robert venturi and frank 
gehry were picked tuesday to design a plan to turn a 19th century 
factory into the worlds largest contemporary art museum 
the two architects joined with two other firms brunercott amp 
associates of cambridge and skidmore owings amp merrill of new york 
in their submission for the renovation of the huge sprague 
electric co plant into a museum to house major collections of 20th 
century art 
their team was chosen by a panel of international art experts 
and local businessmen and politicians after a twoday study of 23 
proposals for revamping the factory 
joseph thompson the director of the museums executive planning 
group said the architects were chosen because of their reputation 
gehry designed the temporary building housing the los angeles 
museum of contemporary art called the temporary contemporary 
and venturi is working on a wing to the national gallery of art in 
london 
both men are known for their odd contemporary designs venturi 
for example once designed a building painted in paisley swirls 
thompson however said the architects have a proven 
reputation for sensitivity to the context of a project and have 
shown sympathy for the industrial setting of the site itself 
the setting for the planned massachusetts museum of contemporary 
art is a 28building factory in an industrial city in the states 
remote northwest corner 
among the proposals submitted was a design from coop himmelblau 
of los angeles for a giant contemporary sculpture of straps and 
metal above the factory gae aulenti of milan italy submitted an 
inchthick book of photographs of her projects including the gare 
dorsay a paris museum created from a train station 
architect resources of cambridge suggested a glass tower and 
cesar pelli amp associates of new haven conn proposed a large 
contemporary tower in a courtyard to contrast with the factorys 
clock tower 
the winning team did not submit a specific design proposal 
thompson said the team will begin working on design and engineering 
prototypes and cost and market analyses for a 17 million study 
on the projects feasibility 
the study will be turned over to the state office of 
administration and finance which must approve it before releasing 
33 million in funds earmarked by the legislature for the 
renovation

higher commodity prices mean less grain and 
other items going to needy countries under the food for peace 
program in 198889 a report by the agriculture department showed 
tuesday 
acting undersecretary richard w goldberg said allocations for 
the fiscal year that began oct 1 total about 3 million metric tons 
of grain equivalent valued at 663 million 
under the program a year ago allocations totaled 44 million 
tons of food commodities worth 648 million 
despite the dollar increase higher prices for grain and some 
other commodities have resulted in lower tonnages for the new year 
for example a year ago about 38 million tons of wheat flour were 
allocated in the new allocation wheat flour totaled less than 25 
million tons 
the food for peace program includes titles that allow 
concessional sales to designated countries for up to 40 years 
including an initial 10year grace period and low interest rates 
another allows the forgiveness of debt incurred under the 
concessional sales based on development carried out by the 
recipient countries 
goldberg said 1395 million in unallocated funds has been set 
aside as a reserve to provide commodities for unforeseen needs 
during the year last year the reserve was 856 million 
the largest allocations went to egypt 170 million pakistan 
80 million and bangladesh 60 million

an iranian leader said tuesday that the 
persian gulf war could resume but that iran has a new mystery 
weapon with which to deter iraq from resuming attacks on cities 
tehran radio quoted hashemi rafsanjani speaker of the iranian 
parliament and military commanderinchief as saying the 
probability exists that the 8yearold war with iraq could 
break out again 
he said iran considers itself neither in a state of war nor a 
state of peace despite a unsponsored ceasefire that took 
effect aug 20 
rafsanjani said iran had acquired a device to deter iraq 
but did not describe it 
president saddam hussein of iraq claimed on sept 27 that his 
country had developed a weapon only two other countries possessed 
he did not elaborate but said it was not a chemical device 
iran and iraq each has sought in some degree to develop nuclear 
capability israel bombed a frenchbuilt nuclear plant west of 
baghdad in 1981 to curb iraqs potential 
western military analysts dismissed the possibility that 
rafsanjani was referring to a nuclear device some military 
analysts consulted by the associated press said the iranians may 
have a new mediumrange missile capable of hitting iraqi cities 
most found it more likely that rafsanjani was engaging in a game 
of bluff with iraq which demonstrated during the last round of the 
war of the cities earlier this year that it had a greater 
supply of effective missiles 
the radio said rafsanjani commented after a threeday tour of 
irans devastated western region 
it quoted him as saying we must not forget that our enemy 
might have the same motives of the past although it will not 
easily welcome the danger of resuming the war because of the 
situation it has encountered but the possibility exists 
peace talks between iran and iraq stalled almost as soon as they 
began in geneva five days after the ceasefire date iraq insists 
on sovereignty over the entire shattalarab waterway which forms 
the southern border and is its only outlet to the sea

in the years after it was founded in 
1943 radcliffe colleges arthur and elizabeth schlesinger library 
on the history of women in america was a sleepy place with few 
visitors curators say 
but with its official reopening tuesday after a 35 million 
renovation the library is sleepy no longer after its humble 
beginnings in two small rooms in the basement of a building on the 
radcliffe campus the library now occupies the entire structure 
because of the interest sparked in womens studies by the 
feminist movement the number of visiting researchers now numbers 
about 5000 per year 
the library the only one of its kind in the nation collects 
materials on womens roles and contributions from 1800 to the 
present it includes a collection so varied that one can study 
aviatrix amelia earharts papers research the early womens 
suffrage movement peruse 5000 cookbooks or review former first 
lady eleanor roosevelts book of common sense etiquette 
the redbrick building in radcliffe yard houses rooms for 
visiting scholars film and videotape viewing rooms for oral 
history projects photography exhibits 500 womens 
interestperiodicals a planned wooden relief by sculptress louise 
nevelson and the 5000volume julia child study area named for the 
famed chef 
its like a quantum jump in the recognition that real womens 
issues and history are here to stay said eva moseley curator of 
manuscripts who has been at the library since 1971 
alongside oil portraits of lydia pinkham who marketed a 
wellknown patent remedy for womens illnesses and stained glass 
artist sarah wyman whitman visitors can examine more than 30000 
books that concern women on exhibit are memorabilia from the 
womens suffrage movement rattlers shaken by women in suffrage 
parades banners and placards reading keep cool there will be 
nothing to worry about after we get votes for women 
elizabeth shenton assistant to the library director said the 
library was almost a closet when she began work there 21 years ago 
we were in two little rooms she recalled it was such an 
event when one researcher came that we offered them tea but the 
womens movement increased interest in us so much it just 
ballooned 
the library was launched in 1943 as the womens rights 
collection using papers donated to the college from suffragist maud 
park wood a member of radcliffes class of 1898 
the collection opened to the public in 1949 with 300 books and 
1156 manuscripts in 1965 the library was renamed to honor 
harvard history professor schlesinger and his wife who was a 
historian of women and active in the league of women voters their 
son historian arthur jr has said that his mother raised my 
fathers consciousness 
in later years the library began to focus on the contributions 
women have made to domestic life an exhibit of etiquette books 
such as no nice girls swear is on display 
one of the most unusual collections consists of cookbooks from 
the 1800s to the present stacked in shelves near a huge blownup 
photograph of child her papers are also part of the library 
gina deangelis 25 a thirdyear student at boston university 
law school was at the library tuesday researching womens unions 
in the 1940s for a legal history class 
this is the only library where i could find this material 
she said 
museum staffer nancy falk said that for years women studying at 
colleges in the area were unaware of the librarys existence 
all of sudden though women are a legitimate field of 
study she said 
the renovation of the existing 1908 building was financed by 
more than 3500 gifts and grants

a technician who plugged a connector 
into the wrong receptacle caused a flash electrical fire that did 
minor damage to the 216 million magellan venus probe being readied 
for a space shuttle launch next year nasa reported tuesday 
smoke and a 2to3inch flame spurted from a spacecraft battery 
when the worker tried to insert the cable connector into the wrong 
slot monday night magellan project official vince wirth said 
technicians on the scene quickly put out the fire within a 
minute with a halon fire extinguisher wirth said but by then 
the damage was done it resulted in a short that damaged the 
battery and wire harness and insulation blankets near the battery 
he termed the damage minor and estimated it would take five to 
seven days to get spacecraft preparation back on schedule he said 
there would be no impact on the april launch date aboard the 
shuttle atlantis 
wirth played a videotape made tuesday that showed some soot 
damage around the battery area the battery he explained was 
being used to run routine power system checks in the spacecrafts 
forward equipment module and is not part of the flight hardware 
he said the fire deposited some soot grease and grime on 
parts of the spacecraft and that it would have to be cleaned up he 
said magellan because of its planetary mission has to be kept 
extremely contaminationfree and that cleaning experts were being 
flown in from nasas jet propulsion laboratory in pasadena calif 
and from martin marietta in denver where the craft was built 
because an electrical short was involved wirth said engineers 
were checking to make certain there was no damage to other 
electrical components such as the spacecraft signal processor 
in washington nasa administrator james c fletcher told 
reporters apparently the wrong plug was put in the power supply 
i dont know whether you ever tried to put a multipronged plug 
into a socket but its hard to do it wouldnt fit so he pushed 
it a little bit and it shorted out the battery 
we shouldnt allow this kind of stuff fletcher added 
its a human error well have an investigation and take some 
steps so it wont happen in the future 
wirth said the technician who made the mistake worked for martin 
marietta which delivered magellan here on oct 8 the spacecraft 
is being assembled and checked in a processing building when fully 
assembled the craft will stand 21 feet tall and weigh 7800 pounds 
wirth said because of the recent delivery many electrical 
components still had not been installed reducing the possibility 
of more damage and several protective shipping covers were still 
in place cutting down on the spread of soot 
atlantis astronaut crew is to release the spacecraft from the 
cargo bay to start it on a 446day trip to venus while magellan 
orbits the planet its advanced radar will peer through the 
constant clouds and map the surface 
before that mission atlantis has another flight assignment it 
is being readied here for a late november launch in which it is to 
carry a classified defense department payload into orbit a problem 
with an actuator that controls the left wing flap has delayed for a 
few days its transfer from a processing facility to an assembly 
building where it will be joined with its two solid fuel booster 
rockets and external fuel tank 
a firm launch date will not be set until a flight readiness 
review scheduled nov 9 and 10 
the flight will be the second for the shuttle program since the 
challenger explosion in january 1986 discovery completed a highly 
successful mission on oct 3 and is now being groomed for a 
february launch

the roman catholic patriarch of jerusalem 
appealed to president reagan on behalf of palestinians in 
israelioccupied territories tuesday and told us officials he 
hoped for official recognition of the palestine liberation 
organization 
archbishop michel sabbah the first palestinian to hold the 
latin patriarch post said he told reagan at a 10minute meeting 
that the jewish people are enjoying their human rights the 
palestinians are not since 1967 they have been living under 
israeli military occupation 
the president said in response that he hopes for an end to 
violence and peace in the area through negotiations sabbah told 
reporters 
meanwhile 17 past winners of nobel prizes sent letters to the 
leaders of egypt israel jordan syria and the united states 
urging negotiations to resolve the israelipalestinian dispute 
the letters said negotiations can lead to a settlement which 
embraces renunciation of terrorism and aggression and the 
protection of minorities within a selfgoverned palestinian 
homeland 
all parties must at long last realize that they cannot have 
peace without compromise and that there will be no chance of peace 
without negotiation said the nobel laureates letters 
sabbah said he had earlier conveyed to secretary of state george 
shultz the palestinian peoples hopes that the plo eventually will 
be accepted as their spokesman 
i mentioned that our representatives are the plo we hope 
that some day the palestinians will have their rights and their 
representatives he said sabbah said the brief meeting did not 
allow him to broach the plo topic with reagan 
the us and israeli governments reject dealings with the plo 
because of its terrorist activity 
sabbah whose diocese includes israel jordan and cyprus is on 
a monthlong pastoral visit to the united states 
emphasizing that he spoke as a clergyman rather than politician 
he said there are two peoples living in the holy land the 
jewish people and the palestinian people both have inalienable 
human rights justice demands giving the jews and the 
palestinians the same human rights 
in parts of the holy land torn by an 11month palestinian 
uprising and clashes with israeli soldiers the patriarch said 
the oppressed and suffering are the palestinians so i must speak 
for them were the oppressed and suffering the jewish people i 
would equally plead their cause as the latin patriarch my 
concern is not only for catholics but for all peoples christians 
moslems and jews 
archbishop sabbah born in nazareth was named latin patriarch 
by pope john paul ii and ordained by him in rome last january 
previously he had served seven years as president of the catholic 
university of bethlehem 
the nobel laureates who signed the letters included christian b

first lady nancy reagan broke her little 
promise to stop accepting expensive designer gowns and jewelry 
lent to her by leading couturiers her press secretary said tuesday 
spokeswoman elaine crispen said that when the practice came into 
question in 1982 it was decided that mrs reagans transactions 
would be reported on president reagans financial disclosure form 
she also acknowledged that the first lady vowed at the time to 
discontinue accepting designer clothing 
sheila tate thenpress secretary to mrs reagan told reporters 
in february 1982 the first lady would stop accepting free clothing 
her purpose was to help the fashion industry but she felt it was 
being misunderstood mrs tate said 
basically she set her own little rule mrs crispin said 
tuesday she made a promise not to do this again and she broke 
her little promise because she just didnt feel she had to do it 
meanwhile the office of government ethics reaffirmed its 1982 
decision that such disclosures on reagans financial forms were not 
technically required under the ethics in government act 
deputy director donald campbell said at this time there is 
no belief here in the office that the decision was not the correct 
one 
but campbell also said that officials would reassess the 
situation if theres any indication of an error that we made 
the ethics law requires reporting by an official or by the 
officials spouse of any loans in excess of 10000 in any year 
in 1984 thenrep george v hansen ridaho was convicted in 
federal court of failing to disclose on his ethics form two loans 
made to his wife by texas millionaire nelson bunker hunt hansen 
served 11 months in prison 
questions about mrs reagans dealings with designers dominated 
the white house news briefing for a second consecutive day 
pressed to discuss what implications mrs reagans 
clothesacquisition proclivities might have on the presidents tax 
forms and financial disclosure forms spokesman marlin fitzwater 
said as far as were concerned theres no consequence for 
the presidents financial disclosure form or his tax forms period 
there is no legal problem there is no ethical problem he 
said there are all kinds of innuendo and insinuations of 
illegality and improprieties that are totally incorrect 
in a may 4 1982 letter thenwhite house counsel fred f 
fielding told j jackson walter director of the office of 
government ethics 
we have agreed that the practice of making the clothing and 
other personal property available for the first ladys use does 
not constitute a gift within the meaning of that term in the 
ethics in government act of 1978 and therefore it need not be 
reported in the presidents financial disclosure form 
fielding went on to say that i advised nonetheless that 
although there is no requirement to list these uses nor manner in 
which to evaluate them the presidents report should err on the 
side of disclosure 
walter initialed the letter with his approval and returned it to 
fielding 
mrs reagan has been borrowing expensive gowns and other 
merchandise since 1982 without any disclosures her spokeswoman had 
acknowledged but mrs crispen said these clothes have been 
returned 
mrs reagans transactions during 1981 were reported 
subsequently on a gifts attachment to the disclosure form the 
president filed late in may 1982 
mrs crispen on monday denied that mrs reagan has kept any of 
the expensive items although she said the first lady regrets 
that she failed to heed fieldings advice to report the 
transactions anyhow 
at his news briefing tuesday fitzwater was peppered with 
questions when asked what the president thought about the story 
he replied that reagan considers it a cheap political shot 
against the first lady

a federal appeals court dismissed a claim by 
110 members of congress that president reagan should have invoked 
the 1983 war powers resolution when navy ships were sent to the 
persian gulf last year the court said tuesday 
a threejudge panel of the us circuit court of appeals in 
washington said the ceasefire in the iraniraq war had rendered 
the warpowers issue moot 
the ruling was made by circuit judges patricia wald harry 
edwards and stephen williams in a brief order filed monday and made 
public tuesday 
the panel had been asked to review a lower courts dismissal 
last year of the lawsuit on the ground that it presented a 
political question upon which judges cannot rule 
the appeals court however dismissed the case without deciding 
that question 
the issue in the case filed by rep mike lowry dwash and 109 
colleagues was whether president reagan should have notified 
congress within 48 hours of sending navy ships to escort reflagged 
kuwaiti oil tankers in the persian gulf last year 
the 1983 war powers resolution requires the president in the 
absence of a declaration of war to notify congress whenever us 
forces are sent into hostilities 
the lawmakers claimed they were denied participation in the 
warmaking process because reagan did not submit notice under the 
resolution the president must withdraw forces within 60 days 
absent a declaration or war or seek an extension from congress 
the members of congress can claim no present injury as a 
result of their reduced ability to participate in a process which 
has been completed the court said 
appellants assertion of continuing injury is thus logically 
dependent upon their ability to demonstrate that hostilities are 
currently present or imminent that demonstration cannot be made 
the court said 
one of the plaintiffs rep peter defazio dore said the 
courts decision was a disaster for the war powers resolution and 
the constitution 
future presidents will have no hesitation to ignore the 
clear requirements of this law as of today the war powers 
resolution isnt worth the paper it was printed on he said in a 
statement 
the court had asked both sides to file briefs on how the 
ceasefire between iran and iraq affected the case 
lawmakers argued in their brief that us forces still faced 
imminent hostilities because the ceasefire between the two 
countries is unstable 
but the court said the court could not decide the merits of that 
claim because it would require an inquiry into the likely 
intentions of the iranian and iraqi governments that is beyond 
the judicial competence

the use of the hallucinogenic drug peyote in 
american indian religious ceremonies is protected by the first 
amendment of the us constitution the state supreme court ruled 
tuesday 
the ruling concerns two former douglas county drug counselors 
who were fired and denied jobless benefits for using the drug 
during american indian religious ceremonies 
peyote is a cactus that contains mescaline an illegal 
hallucinogenic drug the drug long has been used in ceremonies of 
the american indian church even though peyote possession is a 
felony 
tuesdays ruling echoed the courts 1986 decision in which it 
said denying jobless benefits to alfred smith and galen black 
violated their constitutional rights to freely practice religion 
attorney suanne lovendahl said the ruling puts the native 
american church on equal footing with majority religions in this 
country 
this case shows our constitutional system does work and it 
does protect people who are out of the mainstream lovendahl said 
deputy attorney general bill gary said the state hasnt decided 
whether to seek further court review of the case however gary 
expressed concern the ruling would set a precedent 
clearly if some forms of drug use must be permitted under the 
constitution because they are religiously motivated the courts 
are going to have to deal with other claims of religious 
exemptions he said 
the case had earlier reached the us supreme court which sent 
it back to the state court for a definitive ruling on whether 
peyote could be legally used in religious ceremonies in oregon 
in arguments before the state supreme court earlier this year 
the attorney generals office said the state has constitutional 
authority to impose a ban on all uses of peyote 
the supreme court in tuesdays decision noted that oregon laws 
against the possession of controlled substances including peyote 
make no exception for the sacramental use of peyote 
at the same time the court said that the outright prohibition 
of good faith religious use of peyote by adult members of the 
native american church would violate the first amendment directly 
and as interpreted by congress

filipinos hurriedly reconstructed a 
dynamiteblasted statue of gen douglas macarthur and pronounced it 
ready on tuesday for an anniversary ceremony this week 
the rebuilt concrete figure has macarthurs left shoulder larger 
than the right making it look like its about to tip over missing 
is the imperial air given the late american fourstar general by 
the original sculpture 
but this coastal village on leyte island wanted to have the 
10foothigh statue back up in time for a ceremony thursday marking 
the day when macarthur led us troops in liberating the 
philippines from japan on oct 20 1944 world war ii veterans 
already have begun arriving here 
four days earlier vandals blasted apart the statue which shows 
macarthur flanked by filipinos and american soldiers wading 
ashore on leyte 
police suspect despoilers under the influence of alcohol or 
drugs may have been responsible but do not rule out communist 
rebels as suspects 
laborers reinforced the statues steel frame to minimize damage 
in case of a second attack 
dozens of former japanese soldiers visited the site tuesday 
about 300 miles southeast of manila most of them posed for 
photographs in front of macarthurs statue 
among the americans in palo was dr alfredo mescallado 75 of 
new york city a naturalized american of filipino descent who 
served as a physician under macarthur during the war 
i think the vandalism was immoral said mescallado 
maybe the vandals didnt know that macarthur liberated the 
philippines they dont know their history

the senate warning that it might attempt to 
renew military aid to nicaraguan rebel forces at a future date 
voiced its moral support for the contras on tuesday and also 
formally embraced chiles movement toward democracy 
the nonbinding sense of the senate proposals were attached 
as amendments to an unrelated bill which designates 143 million 
acres of forest service land in montana as wilderness 
another amendment called upon us allies to turn back efforts 
of the soviet union to obtain millions of dollars worth of loans 
the bill was approved by the senate but it faces an uncertain 
future it must still be approved by the house and that chamber 
may not finish work on it before the 100th congress adjourns 
the contra amendment endorsed on a 5412 vote supports 
unspecified continuing efforts to strengthen the internal 
democratic opposition and the independent media of nicaragua 
it also calls for maintaining the nicaraguan freedom fighters 
as one of the few pressure points on the sandinistas by providing 
the resistance urgently needed humanitarian assistance 
the proposal was offered by sen john mccain rariz who said 
we need to send a message not only to the resistance in 
nicaragua but to people throughout the world 
white house officials and gop lawmakers have said prospects are 
nil for obtaining a 165 million cache of weapons for the rebels 
in the waning days of the 100th congress 
the dwindling contra forces are subsisting on 27 million in 
food clothing and medical supplies approved by congress last month 
as part of a pentagon money bill they have received no weaponry 
from the united states since february when lethal aid was 
suspended 
the mood in congress remains strongly opposed to sending new 
military aid but congress has approved a complicated process 
permitting president reagan to request the release of the 165 
million in weapons if certain conditions were met 
reagan said last week he might call the congress into special 
session to vote for the aid should the sandinistas strike hard 
against the contra guerrillas before the new congress convenes next 
january 
the plan approved tuesday endorsed that view it warns that 
nicaraguan failure to comply with central american peace accords 
will inevitably cause the congress to approve additional military 
assistance for the nicaraguan resistance 
sen william armstrong rwyo complained about the amendment 
anybody can send a message what i think we ought to send is 
military support i dont think we ought to kid ourselves this 
resolution isnt much 
the chilean proposal was sponsored by sen tom harkin diowa 
and was added to the contra measure on a voice vote 
he noted the oct 5 vote to reject a new presidetial term for 
gen augusto pinochet the military leader who has ruled the nation 
since a 1973 coup overthrew the socialist civilian president 
salvador allende 
weve have a long night of despair in chile from the coup in 
1973 to until this year said harkin its incumbent on us to 
support the chilean people to support this election they had to 
say that we are going to work with them in this restoration of full 
democracy 
sen jesse helms rnc complained that the proposal was a 
feelgood amendment and said pinochet had saved chile from going 
communist 
sen steve symms ridaho sponsored the soviet loan amendment 
which was approved 642 
the soviets are trying to secure loans of us dollars through 
third nations symms said the soviets are using the eagerness of 
the western allies to play one nation off against another to get 
them to compete with each other for the opportunity to donate hard 
currency to finance socialist economic failures and soviet foreign 
policy he said 
the wildneress bill affects more than 6 million acres of montana 
and is the result of a compromise worked out among competiting 
interests including conservationists and the timber and lumber 
industries 
the bill designates about 143 million acres of forest service 
land as wilderness 360000 acres as special management areas and 
another 20000 acres as federal study areas it also releases for 
nonwildnerness uses more than 10 million acres in montanas 10 
national forests

iraq has agreed to send home all iranian 
prisoners of war if iran reciprocates and an iranian diplomat said 
tuesday he saw no reason why the exchange could not proceed 
but iraq said the pow exchange would be unrelated to other 
issues in the unsponsored peace talks between the persian gulf 
neighbors that went to war in september 1980 
an iraqi diplomat said his governments proposal would apply to 
all prisoners of war if iran accepts the plan 
an iranian envoy noted both nations had exchanged sick and 
wounded pows previously on a humanitarian basis and said similar 
repatriation could begin for the remaining prisoners 
both diplomats spoke on condition of anonymity 
according to the red cross which has sought the exchange iran 
has 50182 pows and iraq 19284 
but un officials and iraqi and iranian diplomats place the 
figures much higher with many of the prisoners not registered 
they estimate iran is holding from 6000070000 pows and iraq 
3000050000 
ismat kittani iraqs ambassador to the united nations said in 
a letter given monday to secretarygeneral javier perez de cuellar 
that iraq is ready to begin the pow exchange 
but he added since the exchange of prisoners is a 
humanitarian matter our agreement on this step is unrelated to 
the other issues referred to in the un agenda for peace talks 
security council resolution 598 called for an immediate 
ceasefire withdrawal of troops to internationally recognized 
boundries and an exchange of prisoners 
if the exchange occurs it could help end a deadlock in the 
peace talks that have not gone beyond acceptance of the ceasefire 
that began aug 20 and the opening of negotiations five days later 
a senior un official close to the discussions told the 
associated press that although iraq said the exchange would be 
unrelated to the talks the offer represented an advance in iraqs 
position 
a major issue is the dispute over control of the shattalarab 
waterway that forms the southern border between the two countries 
in baghdad iraq deputy foreign minister nizzar hamdoun said 
iran was setting unacceptable conditions by insisting that both 
countries follow a 1975 treaty that placed the border down the 
middle of the shattalarab 
iraq wants the border to be drawnl along the iranian shorline 
and has said the treaty is not valid 
the iranian position is an attempt to pressure iraq to 
relinquish its political and legal rights while the two sides are 
discussing purely technical issues hamdoun said 
irans foreign minister aliakbar velayati said monday that 
iran agreed to a un peace plan but with the condition that the 
1975 treaty is upheld 
negotiations are to resume next week in geneva

a division of litton systems inc paid 195 
million to resolve claims that the company inflated bids to supply 
the government with military hardware aircraft instrumentation and 
radar equipment the justice department said tuesday 
the civil settlement with clifton precision special devices of 
springfield pa was reached following an audit cnducted and paid 
for by litton under a 1986 agreement with the government 
the government alleged the company had failed to submit accurate 
labor cost history when it bid on the contracts despite littons 
certification that it had done so the government says it overpaid 
labor costs during a nineyear period in connection with the 
contracts 
litton was indicted and pleaded guilty in 1986 to defrauding the 
government in bidding the material costs on the contracts litton 
paid 119 million to settle the material issues and agreed to pay 
double damages and interest on other claims after losses were 
determined the new agreement addresses that determination

sudans dusty paths became trails of 
death where an an estimated 260000 refugees mostly children 
starved or died in the gunfire of a civil war this year western 
relief officials said tuesday 
among the victims were 180000 children fleeing the war with 
their parents and about 95000 could have been saved by simple 
medical help such as vaccination said cole dodge khartoum 
representative of the united nations childwelfare organization 
unicef 
the relief officials said most of the quartermillion people 
died during long treks northward toward khartoum or eastward into 
ethiopia in search of safety 
the officials said the refugees of whom one in five died 
suffered from lack of food or medical care after they left their 
home villages 
you have to notice that exceptionally large numbers of people 
affected by an accumulation of the effects of five years of war 
left their homes this year deaths in other years have been much 
lower said dodge 
up to 2 million people have fled their homes in the southern 
battle zone since the rebel sudan peoples liberation army led by 
useducated renegade army col john garang took up arms against 
the government in 1983 
the rebels who are mostly christian or animist dinka tribesmen 
are fighting the government dominated by arabdescended moslems 
dodge said dimished farming and commerce in southern sudan since 
the war began have contributed to conditions that led to the high 
number of deaths in 1988 
the result is staggering 260000 estimated deaths and thats 
a conservative estimate said one official who spoke on 
condition of anonymity 
haj tayeb acting commissioner of relief said western agencies 
have exaggerated the casualties however he said the government 
has no estimates on the numbers of civilians who died or were made 
homeless in the war 
an army spokesman who requested anonymity said there also were 
no official estimates of government or rebel battlefield casualties 
western relief figures show that in 1988 700000 southerners 
walked to the northern capital of khartoum 150000 to the southern 
town of juba 300000 to ethiopia and 150000 to the regions of 
kordofan and darfur in western sudan 
bryan wannop representative of the un development program 
said relief organizations must distribute the food cautiously so 
that it doesnt fall into the hands of the rebels 
the government in khartoum has accused some agencies of 
supporting the guerrillas and has expelled several organizations 
the guerrillas say they control more than 90 percent of the 
southern countryside but the government says it controls the main 
towns the towns are restricted to most western relief agencies 
making it difficult to assess conditions there 
the us agency for international development announced last 
week it was beginning a 1 million airlift to abyei a refugee town 
of about 35000 just north of the war zone an estimated 3000 
residents starved or died of diseases during the summer up to 
10000 people were estimated to have died in the southern kordofan 
area near abyei 
sources who spoke on condition of anonymity said the us agency 
also was trying to charter aircraft for a relief mission to the 
rebelbesieged town of aweil in the heart of the war zone an 
estimated 6000 civilians and an undetermined number of troops were 
reported stranded there with almost no food or supplies 
but the sources said the american agency was having trouble 
chartering a plane since insurance rates have soared because of 
rebel threats to shoot down relief planes another problem was 
obtaining military approval for the flights the sources said 
a military spokesman who asked not to be identified charged that 
some nongovernmental western relief organizations provide aid 
mainly to the rebels 
a sudan airways boeing 707 was shot at on takeoff from juba 
airport monday in southern sudan and one engine was hit but the 
plane flew back to khartoum on three engines and landed safely 
informed sources said 
the sources speaking in khartoum on condition of anonymity 
said tuesday they did not know who did the shooting or how many 
people were on the plane which mainly carries relief supplies to 
juba capital of the equatoria region

the government announced tuesday that 
talks with the opposition have been delayed until after oct 24 
and urged its partners in the dialogue to disavow extreme 
elements before the talks begin 
the outlawed solidarity labor federation replied it was ready to 
begin talks immediately and blamed the government for the delay 
government spokesman jerzy urban strongly criticized 
anticommunist banners and slogans during a street protest in 
gdansk on sunday and asked participants in the discussions to 
disassociate themselves from the protesters 
urban denied that the government was losing its will to enter 
the talks or putting new conditions on the discussions which are 
to cover such questions as relegalizing solidarity and economic and 
political pluralism 
there are justified fears that not all the partners of the 
round table are being led by the same intention he said 
urban said talks originally due to start monday were delayed 
because church representatives who will take part wont return from 
rome until oct 24 and because of remaining disagreements over who 
will participate 
its difficult to talk with those who are shouting that they 
want to hang communists said urban 
in this situation the constructive proreformatory 
opposition has to make its decision either it will be willing to 
seek agreement against the extreme wing or it will get linked 
with the extreme elements 
solidarity denied any extremism on its side 
solidarity by the fact that it seeks relegalization 
obviously is ready to act as a legal union which accepts the 
constitution and all the people participating in these talks will 
share the same view solidarity spokesman janusz onyszkiewicz 
said 
onyszkiewicz said the opposition has been ready since monday to 
begin he said further delay could raise questions about the 
governments desire for dialogue and prolongs an atmosphere of 
hopelessness that he said led to the gdansk episode 
solidarity leader lech walesa and interior minister gen czeslaw 
kiszczak originally agreed to the talks on aug 31 
walesa then brought a halt to nationwide strikes that were 
polands worst labor unrest since 1981 
while refusing to give a likely date for convening the round 
table urban said officials would like discussions to begin between 
oct 24 and the nov 2 visit to poland by britains prime minister 
margaret thatcher 
he said the atmosphere for the talks was made worse by the 
sunday march by about 700 youths in the baltic port city of gdansk 
that ended with youths throwing rocks at riot police official 
state publications and television gave heavy coverage to the 
incident 
the staterun pap news agency said a prosecutor was 
investigating 
urban said that among slogans chanted were communists will 
hang on trees instead of leaves and better the coffin than the 
commune 
i think that the organizers of this demonstration were 
striving for torpedoing the agreement for talks and for 
overturning the round table he said 
but solidarity spokeswoman barbara madajskakrasowska on sunday 
said solidarity activists tried to persuade the demonstrators to 
disperse the youths left only after police with water cannon 
arrived she said 
urban said tuesday that a problem remained with the proposed 
participation of longtime solidarity advisers jacek kuron and adam 
michnik 
gen kiszczaks offer said that all who stand on the 
ground of socialism and the constitutional order can sit at this 
table urban said its difficult for michnik and kuron to fit 
into this category 
the roman catholic church expressed concern tuesday night that 
job guarantees given workers who ended strikes in august and 
september were violated 
the episcopate secretariat representing catholic bishops 
nationwide said it sent a letter monday to kiszczak reminding him 
of the guarantees of personal and employment security for strikers 
coal miners in southern silesia and steel workers in the 
southeastern city of stalowa wola complained that strikers lost 
their jobs or suffered other reprisals the secretariat reported 
in another announcement urban said that prime minister 
mieczyslaw f rakowski plans to visit the soviet union this week in 
his first trip abroad as head of government urban did not give an 
exact date

democrat lloyd bentsen unleashed a snarling 
attack tuesday on the republicans for running a campaign that has 
turned the presidential election into a carnival sideshow of 
nonsense and negativism 
we have witnessed through the combined efforts of the 
republican party and their image makers and their nominees for 
president and vice president one of the most outrageous displays 
of negative campaigning ever seen in the history of national 
politics michael dukakis running made said in a speech before 
more than a thousand students in a ucla auditorium they were 
attending a forum on public service sponsored by sen sam nunn 
dga 
the idea of citizenship in fact the very idea of 
selfgovernment itself is under attack the texas senator said 
and there is no greater violation of that trust than to turn a 
great national election into a carnival sideshow of nonsense and 
negativism 
what has happened almost without notice is an utterly 
vicious assault of distortion and character assassination 
directed at dukakis he said 
they dont seem to mind what they say is untrue he said 
they dont seem to mind if its misleading they dont seem to 
care that what they do is downright mean if it sounds good say 
it if it sells package it if it looks good nominate it 
bentsen said the democrats have at times been slow to respond to 
the charges but i dont think we ever imagined that george bush 
and the republicans would be so willing to debase that precious 
currency of our democracy 
the democrats have taken a beating from the pundits and the 
pollsters who have pointed to an open casket in the ground and 
virtually invited us to jump in but bentsen who had been 
promisng a giveem hell campaign for days said weve got 
three weeks to go theres a lot of work ahead and theres no time 
for mourning because we intend to win 
bentsen ridiculed bushs statement that he believed in public 
service saying the republican white house philosophy preaches 
contempt for government and get while the gettings good 
they dont believe in much of anything at all when it comes to 
public service because they have nothing but disdain for the role 
government can play in the life of this nation he said 
they dont understand the need for strong ethical boundaries 
between public service and private gain he said 
following the ucla forum bentsen visited a mcdonnell douglas 
aerospace plant in nearby huntington beach with nunn the 
conservative chairman of the senate armed services committee nunn 
blasted the republican assertion that the democrats would cut 
defense recalling former louisiana gov earl longs remark that to 
tell when the opposition was lying watch for when they move 
their lips 
and then bentsen emerged from a mockup of a space station to 
deliver a stump speech on defense and the space program 
bentsen was traveling next to a rally in san jose completing a 
sweep of the three biggest california media markets in one day 
tuesday morning bentsen told local elected officials meeting in 
san diego that democrats would pursue a much needed change in the 
nations trade and economic relations with its allies 
were not going to become hewers of wood and carriers of water 
for the rest of the world thats not our idea of americas 
future bentsen told the league of california cities convention 
bentsen said the republican administration has failed to promote 
us trade and has led the nation further and further into debt to 
foreign countries 
many years ago the famous pitcher satchel paige coined the 
phrase dont look back somebody might be gaining on you he 
said the need he said was for america to work harder and 
smarter than the competition 
dukakis he said had proven an ability to attract and sustain 
high technology industries 
bentsen said the united states must continue its role in 
protecting its allies militarily but he said it was time for 
japan and europe to start paying their fair share of the cost

communist party factions argued 
tuesday about ethnic and social strife straining the fragile 
yugoslav union but the central committee ajourned for the night 
without making any major announcements 
the session ended without a vote on personnel changes the 
tanjug news agency said the meeting would resume wednesday morning 
early wednesday editions of the official newspaper borba said 
many of the 200000 serbs in troubled kosovo province were 
dissatisfied with the fruitless and marathon discussions by 
central committee members and planned a protest rally thursday in 
pristina the provincial capital 
the committee is expected to make major personnel and policy 
changes in efforts to quiet demands for dismissal of leaders blamed 
in public protests for the nations worst economic crisis since 
world war ii 
ten members of the 23man ruling politburo including national 
party chief stipe suvar face a secret vote of confidence in the 
162member central committee 
four politburo members are not involved in the vote because they 
already have promised to resign nine are exempt because they hold 
their seats as party leaders of the armed forces and of 
yugoslavias six republics and two autonomous provinces 
one of those exempt from the vote is slobodan milosevic the 
populist party leader of serbia his is the largest republic and 
the two autonomous provinces vojvodina and kosovo are part of it 
his campaign for greater serbian control over the provinces has 
split the national party leadership pitting him against 
politicians who fear his standing with the people will rise at 
their expense 
serbs have rallied by the hundreds of thousands in recent weeks 
to express anger at alleged harassment of the slavic minority by 
the huge ethnic albanian majority in kosovo region the ancient 
serbian heartland adjacent to albania 
at a time of growing economic hardship milosevic has found 
broad sympathy for his demand that sweeping leadership changes be 
made 
inflation is running at an annual rate of 217 percent causing 
real wages to plummet and the foreign debt currently stands at 21 
billion austerity measures imposed in may have inspired strikes 
and protests by workers whose average monthly wage is the 
equivalent of less than 100 
yugoslavia has not had strong leadership since president josip 
broz tito died in 1980 
each republic and autonomous province has its own government and 
party structure tito put the decentralized system and collective 
federal presidency in his 1974 constitution to prevent one republic 
from gaining sway but the result has been ineffective government 
by compromise 
milosevics activities have put him in open conflict with suvar 
and milan kucan party chief in slovenia a liberal 
westernoriented northern republic 
branko greganovic leader of yugoslavias official youth union 
indirectly attacked milosevic on tuesday 
those leaders who are putting themselves at the head of 
discontented masses behave as if they were gifts from god he 
said they behave as if they did not come to power with the 
leaders they now attack mercilessly 
raif dizdarevic current head of the ninemember collective 
federal presidency seemed to rebuke both milosevic and kucan in 
backing suvars call for party unity 
the lack of unity in the leadership multiplying of late is a 
great danger for the country he told the central committee 
we need accord to unite in fighting problems without imposing 
some kind of hegemony over one another said dizdarevic who 
threatened nine days ago to impose emergency measures if unrest 
continued he did not specify the measures 
in parliament a government plan to relax austerity measures for 
workers in profitable firms and social services foundered because 
deputies said proposed salary increases were too small 
the international monetary fund which insisted on the austerity 
program introduced in may was said to have approved easing the 
rules for some workers

federal regulators announced approval tuesday 
of an experimental plan for coordinated trading halts or circuit 
breakers in stock and futures markets during steep price dives 
the plan proposed by the new york stock exchange and the 
chicago mercantile exchange provides for a onehour trading halt 
across markets when the dow jones average of 30 industrial stocks 
plunges by 250 points or more from the previous days closing 
it calls for a twohour halt when the dow falls by 400 points 
the securities and exchange commission which regulates the 
stock markets and the commodity futures trading commission which 
oversees futures exchanges approved the oneyear experiment on the 
eve of the first anniversary of the oct 19 1987 stock crash 
the new york stock exchange is the nations largest stock market 
and the chicago mercantile exchange is the largest market for 
trading stock index futures 
other markets including the chicago board options exchange the 
american stock exchange and the national association of securities 
dealers overthecounter system are joining in the plan 
government approval is effective immediately it is up to the 
exchanges to decide when the circuit breaker plan begins 
were ready to implement this as soon as thursday said 
andrew yemma a spokesman for the chicago mercantile exchange we 
think this is a very significant action to remedy what problems 
there were in the market a year ago 
the new york stock exchange did not give a specific start time 
but said it would be very soon 
the plan is designed to provide an orderly halt to trading 
before one market stock or futures breaks down shifting all of 
the trading to the remaining market it also is intended to allow 
time for buyers to step in and counter overwhelming sell orders 
during the 1987 crash the dow plunged a record 508 points 
wiping out 500 billion in paper wealth in a single day 
another part of the program gives individual investors as 
opposed to pension and mutual funds preference in trading on the 
new york stock exchange when the dow moves either up or down by 25 
points the rule applies to orders of 2099 shares and smaller 
after the crash many individual investors complained that their 
orders were shunted aside in some cases for hours while larger 
buy and sell orders from institutional investors were executed 
the market halt plan is one of the key recommendations offered 
after the crash by a presidential task force headed by nicholas 
brady a new york investment banker who is now treasury secretary 
brady did not offer a specific proposal but said some sort of 
circuit breaker was needed to derail a crash 
the national association of securities dealers said earlier this 
month that it was going along with the plan only reluctantly 
because it did not want to be the only market left open when all 
others were closed 
but nasd president joseph r hardiman argued that a 
preannounced trigger for market halts could act as a magnet 
pulling the market down faster as the market approaches the 
trading halt limit it could be flooded with orders from traders 
fearful they will be prevented from selling he said 
with the sec approval which is effective immediately a 
previous sixmonth experiment to curb computerized index arbitrage 
ends the earlier program had imposed a socalled 50point collar 
on the new york stock exchange when the market moved by 50 points 
or more index arbitrage orders were not allowed through the nyses 
automated trading system 
index arbitrage is a form of trading designed to take advantage 
of momentary price discrepancies between the stocks and futures 
markets it involves the buying and selling of massive orders on 
stocks and futures markets and was criticized for making last 
years crash more precipitous 
however the collar experiment ran counter to the brady 
commissions finding that stock and future markets were in effect 
one market and that disconnecting them could be dangerous 
a new rule taking the place of the collar is designed to provide 
more orderly index arbitrage when the standard and poors 500 index 
falls by more than 12 points the equivalent of 96 points on the 
dow index arbitrage orders will be shunted into a side file of 
the trading computer if buy and sell orders can be matched the 
trades will go through if not trading in individual sampp 500 
stocks could be halted

republican george bush said tuesday that with 
inspiration from winston churchill and harry truman he would 
campaign as an underdog until election day despite polls 
showing he has widened his lead over democrat michael dukakis 
no votes can be taken for granted and im not taking any votes 
for granted bush told an audience at westminister college 
westminster was the scene of churchills famous 1946 speech 
declaring that a postwar iron curtain of secrecy and 
selfimposed isolation had surrounded the soviet union and the 
communist eastern bloc 
churchill was right bush said although few americans 
wanted to hear his message at the time 
several dozen protesters demonstrated outside the hall where the 
vice president spoke one carried a sign reading bush is no 
churchill echoing democratic vice presidential nominee lloyd 
bentsens assertion that bush running mate dan quayle was no jack 
kennedy 
bush said a rusting curtain separates east and west today 
but that in europe and other parts of the world we have yet to 
see the full promise of soviet change turn into change itself 
if elected president bush said he would remain wary of soviet 
intentions even though the kremlin leadership under mikhail s 
gorbachev is more enlightened than before 
now is not the time to abandon realism about what moves the 
soviet union he said 
bush mentioned churchill and president truman who came to 
fulton for the former prime ministers speech on march 5 1946 in 
connection with his own election campaign 
churchill had suffered many setbacks and rebounds from oblivion 
during his long tempestuous career in british politics and truman 
scored a stunning upset when he defeated thomas e dewey the 
heavily favored republican candidate in the 1948 presidential 
election 
those two men offer a very personal lesson for me they knew 
the ups and downs of political life like few others they knew that 
political opinion polls can be very misleading and they knew that 
no vote could be taken for granted bush said 
paraphrasing baseball great yogi berra the vice president said 
both churchill and truman knew that no election was over until it 
was really over 
there are undecided voters out there bush said the race 
is close in many states including missouri he said 
as he left his hotel for the westminster speech bush was asked 
how he could call himself an underdog when a new nbc newswall 
street journal poll gave him a 17point lead over dukakis 
were not going to lighten up he replied were going to 
stay right down to the wire if i find anybody letting up in my 
campaign theyre history 
asked how he could expect people to believe he was fighting like 
an underdog bush replied watch my smile and watch me work 
watch how fast we go and where we go were not letting up the 
worst thing to do would be to show a complacency i dont feel or an 
overconfidence that i do not feel 
in his speech 42 years ago churchill said that from stettin 
in the baltic to trieste in the adriatic an iron curtain has 
descended across the continent 
bush said we and our allies did not prevent the iron curtain 
from shutting out the light to the east but we did secure peace 
and freedom for the west 
he said his campaign theme of peace through strength was 
modeled after churchills world view 
on an otherwise light campaign day bush used his official air 
force two jet plane as a backdrop in taping a campaign film and 
attended a rally attended by more than 3000 people at missouri 
state university in springfield 
i have a feeling its going to be tough for the liberals next 
month bush said to the wildly cheering crowd 
bush aides said a new campaign commercial ridiculing dukakis 
ride in an army battle tank began airing tuesday in several areas 
around the country 
this is no time to train somebody in how to meet with the 
russians says the ad which uses news footage of a helmeted 
dukakis standing in the turret of an m1 tank 
the bush campaign is expected to intensify its tv commercials 
dramatically in the final three weeks of the contest aides said 
the vice president would hammer away at proven campaign themes such 
as ussoviet relations space and defense 
bush planned to make a campaign swing wednesday through 
michigan which dukakis toured all day tuesday before he returns 
to washington for the first time in eight days

argentine foreign minister dante caputo said 
tuesday his government is ready to talk to britain about the 
falkland islands without preconditions dropping its insistence 
that sovereignty must be on any agenda 
caputo told independent televisions channel 4 in a broadcast 
interview prerecorded in argentina that he believes the time is 
right to start a dialogue between argentina and britain 
the two countries have had no diplomatic relations since the 
74day falklands war in 1982 won by britain 
i think there is a little light at the end of the tunnel 
caputo said i think that we have enough common history both 
countries and if we start a dialogue without preconditions 
just the dialogue this is going to be very important 
prime minister margaret thatchers government has repeatedly 
stated its willingness to talk with argentina on ways to mend 
relations but has refused to discuss falklands sovereignty with 
buenos aires 
a july 1984 meeting between british and argentine government 
officials at bern switzerland broke down over argentine 
insistence that falklands sovereignty should be on the agenda 
a foreign office statement tuesday night reiterated britains 
refusal to discuss sovereignty over the islands which britain has 
ruled since 1833 and which argentina claims as an inheritance from 
the days of spanish colonial rule an argentine invasion of the 
islands touched off the falklands war 
the british government is determined to seek more normal 
relations with argentina and uphold its commitment to the falkland 
islanders the foreign office said referring to the 1900 mostly 
britishdescended residents who have repeatedly stated their desire 
to remain british 
sovereignty is not for discussion the foreign office said 
if argentina genuinely wishes to improve relations with 
britain she could do so by responding to the large number of 
british proposals already on president raul alfonsins table 
britain and argentina have held indirect talks through the 
united states on some issues britain has said it wants to discuss 
trade air links and fishing with argentina 
caputo currently president of the united nations general 
assembly was asked if he meant argentina would be prepared for 
talks without discussing sovereignty 
im saying without preconditions he replied this is a 
very precise formula without preconditions no preconditions from 
our side no preconditions from their side 
caputo said he hopes the talks will be held before alfonsin 
leaves office in december 1989 
in an accompanying report on next mays presidential election 
channel 4 asked carlos saul menem about caputos proposal for talks 
without preconditions menem the opposition peronist party 
candidate is leading eduardo cesar angeloz of alfonsins radical 
civil union in the polls 
sovereignty has got to be on the table menem said 
otherwise theres no point in talking i dont have any problem 
negotiating with mrs thatcher as long as she knows that the 
islands sovereignty is ours

a 15minute piece of music that the arranger said 
was reconstructed from beethovens last work was warmly applauded 
at its premiere tuesday night but an occasional discordant note 
came later from the audience 
the work presented at londons royal festival hall is 
described as the first movement of what would have been ludwig van 
beethovens 10th symphony 
barry cooper a researcher at aberdeen university said he spent 
five years piecing together symphonic fragments found in berlin 
bonn and vienna after the german composers death 161 years ago 
the sketches struck me as being particularly good even by 
beethovens standards cooper told reporters tuesday as the royal 
liverpool philharmonic orchestra rehearsed for the premiere 
even though my completion wont be as good as beethoven i 
think the overall result has got enough really good beethoven in it 
to make it very well worth hearing 
violinist sir yehudi menuhin who conducted the second half of 
the concert but not the movement said i think it is a valuable 
work it is certainly beethoven 
some purists disagreed 
calling this beethovens 10h was a bad idea said john 
dankworth a classically trained jazz composer it should be 
named excerpts and snippets 
martin woolf who described himself as a music lover said i 
thought it was marvelous fun though i doubt beethoven would have 
followed the ninth with anything like that 
cooper who wrote a book on beethovens creative process while 
working on the musical reconstruction said beethovens plans to 
finish the final symphony were mentioned in a letter written eight 
days before his death in 1827 
he actually offered it to the royal philharmonic society of 
britain cooper said and now theyve got it or as much as there 
is of it 
speaking as a white bust of beethoven solemnly peered over the 
rehearsing musicians cooper called his work a chance for other 
people to get some idea of what beethoven had in mind knowing what 
the 10th symphony is like has increased our knowledge 
the music ranges from whispery quiet sections to bold soaring 
themes over its 15 minutes 
menuhin after hearing the music for the first time at the 
rehearsal said it was a very beautiful work 
the 71yearold musician called the controversy over the 
premiere rather silly 
everyone is eaten with curiosity he said 
asked if the work was important menuhin said they use the 
word important for all kinds of sales of antiques and important 
gold coins i think its at least as important as that 
conductor walter weller called the piece very very 
interesting 
it sounds like a very young powerful beethoven he said 
after the practice session not the beethoven you can hear in a 
slow moment of the ninth symphony the beethoven with one leg in 
another world this is a powerful one 
however weller said he could tell which parts are the real 
beethoven and where cooper filled in the blanks 
according to cooper twothirds of the work was taken directly 
from beethovens sketches which sometimes were nothing more than a 
single line of notes 
theres something of beethoven in every bar he said you 
cant say beethoven stops here and cooper starts there in 
practically every bar its part beethoven and part me 
orchestra members were taking the beethoven brouhaha in stride 
first cellist francis bucknall said the movement is certainly 
beethoven we havent heard this piece of music before so of 
course its important 
i dont think its the best beethoven weve ever heard said 
violist andrea creech but obviously it is very exciting

eleven soviet inspectors watched tuesday as 
us military personnel using handheld power saws began the 
historic destruction of air force cruise missiles under the 
intermediaterange nuclear forces treaty 
led by army major gen vladimir medvedev the soviets arrived at 
davismonthan air force base to watch 41 groundlaunched cruise 
missiles 41 protective canisters for the mobile weapons and seven 
transporter erector launchers be cut in half over the next few days 
the inf treaty is one of the most critical steps in the 
direction of ending the cold war medvedev said after the 
destruction started what we saw today was a critical step in 
that direction 
the soviets who flew from travis air force base near san 
francisco aboard an air force c141 starlifter were met by a us 
delegation headed by brig gen roland lajoie director of the 
defense departments onsite inspection agency 
what we saw today should generate more confidence and 
predictability in our relations lajoie told reporters after the 
first missile was destroyed 
the destruction started with several air force personnel cutting 
into a missile and an aluminum canister with handheld power saws 
the missile was a 21foot device built in 1986 by the 
mcdonnelldouglas astronautics co flighttested at the armys 
dougway proving ground in utah and deployed at an air force station 
in sicily before being shipped to davismonthan in february 
soviet inspectors and us personnel sat on nearby bleachers as 
they watched the work which produced loud noise and acrid smells 
as the saws cut through into metal fire extinguishers were 
positioned near the workers 
also slated for destruction was a 56foot 78000pound launcher 
nuclear warheads fuel and guidancerelated equipment have been 
removed from each weapon and the warheads have been returned to 
the department of energy which stores american nuclear weapons 
said capt kendell pease an osia spokesman 
soviet inspectors have made two previous visits to the united 
states under the treaty once in july and again in august they are 
being escorted during their stay by 22 officials from davismonthan 
and the osia 
a total of 443 intermediaterange cruise missiles deployed in 
great britain and europe are scheduled for destruction all within 
the first three years of the treaty 
signed last december by president reagan and soviet leader 
mikhail gorbachev the treaty also calls for elimination of 169 
shorterrange pershing ia and 234 pershing ii intermediaterange 
missiles that the army has deployed in west germany 
the treaty requires elimination of all landbased nuclear 
missiles with ranges of 300 to 3000 miles the cruise missiles 
have a range of about 1500 miles 
the warheads are not included in the destruction process which 
air force lt col donald black said specifies lengthwise cuts 
through the missiles and cutting the launchers in half 
the treaty does not eliminate the warheads pease said it 
eliminates the ability to deliver the warheads 
he said implementation of the treaty is a confidence builder 
on both sides and an important first step 
col robert stone said destruction of the equipment should be 
completed within about 72 hours 
the inspectors were to wear protective eye gear and ear plugs 
and would remain within the 600by300foot fenced compound at the 
aerospace maintenance and regeneration center the compound houses 
missiles canisters and launchers stockpiled for destruction 
when you have four rescue saws going its worse than going to 
the dentist stone said 
black said 58 pershing missile stages were eliminated between 
sept 8 and friday at the longhorn army ammunition plant at 
karnack texas the army is destroying at least some of the 
pershings by burning their engines 
the pershings each have two stages and their launchers will be 
eliminated beginning this week in germany said susan franklin a 
spokeswoman for the onsite inspection agency in washington 
as of friday the soviet union had eliminated 277 missiles under 
the treaty which specifies destruction of 1846 missiles of 
several types ss20 ss23 ss12 sscx4 ss4 and ss5 
the inf treaty is the first to allow onsite inspection and is 
viewed as a trial for the proposed stategic arms reduction treaty 
that pact would slash arsenals of longrange superpower nuclear 
weapons by 30 percent to 50 percent and call for more intricate 
verification procedures

americans of low and moderate incomes are more 
generous with their financial contributions and time than their 
upper income counterparts according to a gallup poll released 
tuesday 
contrary to popular opinion the welltodo in america cannot 
be described as generous said brian oconnell president of the 
independent sector a coalition of 650 corporate foundation and 
volunteer organizations that commissioned the survey by the gallup 
organization 
giving and volunteering in america is a stark contrast between 
heart warming generosity and bone chilling selfishness he said 
noting the results of the inhome interviews conducted last march 
with 2775 americans 18 years and older 
oconnell told a news conference that contributing households 
with incomes below 10000 gave an average of 28 percent of their 
incomes to charity while families between 10000 and 30000 gave 
25 percent those with incomes between 50000 and 75000 gave 
15 percent families earning 75000 to 100000 donated 17 
percent and those with incomes over 100000 gave 21 percent 
overall the survey said seven out of 10 households in america 
contributed an average of 790 to charitable organizations with 45 
percent volunteering an average of 47 hours a week in time to 
causes and organizations in 1987 independent sector said the 
margin of error was plus or minus 3 percentage points 
these figures translate into 80 million people giving a total of 
195 billion hours with a dollar value of time contributed at 150 
billion oconnell said 
eugene c dorsey head of the groups give five campaign to 
increase volunteerism said the latest study showed it was possible 
to reach the organizations goal of motivating americans to donate 
at least 5 percent of their incomes and five hours a week to the 
causes of their choice 
dorsey who also serves as president of the gannett foundation 
said the findings confirm the need for the give five campaign 
to estabish a basic standard of what we owe to our communities 
virginia a hodgkinson the independent sectors vice president 
for research said the polls finding that giving decreases as 
income increases had been missed in previous gallup surveys which 
measured only the amount given without regard to what percentage of 
income the donated amount represented 
hodgkinson said the results indicated that a typical generous 
american household was a moderate income family of five living in 
the rural midwest that volunteers and belongs to a church the 
least generous profile was a single affluent individual living in 
a central city in the south who does not volunteer or attend 
church she said 
these rankings were formulated by evaluating results of averages 
for weekly volunteerism income and the percentages of family 
members who were volunteers she said 
using this the midwest was first with volunteers donating 25 
hours of their time and 15 percent of their income followed by 
the west 24 hours 15 percent of income the east 20 hours 
12 percent of income and the south 18 hours 17 percent of 
income 
although those questioned in the south gave a greater percentage 
of their earnings to charity hodgkinson said this group had a low 
proportion of households with a volunteer and an overall lower 
number of volunteers in the general population 
community rankings using the same criteria showed rural areas 
volunteered 24 hours and contributed 18 percent of income 
followed by suburban 22 hours 15 of income and central city 
20 hours 13 percent income 
married people gave 25 hours a week and donated 15 percent of 
their incomes compared with singles who gave 20 hours a week and 
only 05 percent of their incomes 
those with three or more children give 27 hours a week and 
donated 20 percent of their income 
the study also indicated the importance of religion in 
volunteerism with 79 percent of church members contributing funds 
and 51 percent volunteering their time compared with 55 percent of 
nonchurch goers giving donations and 33 percent volunteering

the mandalay ruby a royal red gem that weighs 
48 carats was supposed to sell for a record 15 million at auction 
tuesday 
it didnt 
instead a high bid of 76 million was rejected as insufficient 
by the gems owner and the ruby which sothebys earlier called 
the centerpiece of the most important jewelry sale ever held in 
america was taken off the block 
meanwhile christies auction house announced that the largest 
diamond ever auctioned to the public would be offered at a sale 
wednesday 
the 40748carat gem is second in size only to the 53020carat 
cullinan i which is set in britains imperial sceptre as part of 
the crown jewels 
im certain this jewel will set a record price for a single 
precious stone said francois curiel head of christies jewelry 
department 
he refused to estimate the price the record auction price for 
any jewel 931 million the amount paid in april 19 for an 
8591carat white diamond at sothebys 
the diamond currently owned by two new york jewelry dealers and 
a jewelry retail chain in dallas was purchased as an uncut 
890carat stone in august 1984 but has since been cut into a 
flawless stone 
at sothebys auction house tuesday about 300 people strained 
their necks to catch a glimpse of those who put up the 
multimilliondollar bids for the mandalay ruby but the 
auctioneers gavel slammed down a short time later to end the 
bidding without a sale 
jennifer brown a sothebys spokeswoman said the identity of 
the rubys seller would not be revealed 
obviously were disappointed said john d block head of 
sothebys jewelry department this was expected to bring a record 
and it didnt it was such an enormous price we were trying to get 
on unique objects its very hard to put a price on it sometimes 
it doesnt work 
the ruby was offered in the same session as the star of sierra 
leone diamond no 2 which was sold for 352 million tuesday the 
diamond is one of 11 stones cut from a 969carat diamond discovered 
in the west african nation in 1972 
several mandalay ruby bidders who asked not to be identified 
suggested that perhaps extensive presale publicity about the ruby 
had backfired on sothebys 
in its preauction report sothebys had given the mandalay a 
glowing review 
the combination of pleasant shape and proportions fine color 
transparency and luminosity make it an exceptional gemstone 
said a report released by the auction house 
block described the mandalay ruby as the largest faceted gem 
known and estimated it would command about 15 million 
the record price for a ruby is 19 million paid at a paris 
auction in july for a 104carat stone 
the mandalay ruby is framed by 18 diamonds within a 
goldandplatinum broach mounting small diamondset fleurdelys 
designs decorate the corners 
the mandalay ruby named after the burmese city near which it 
was mined was brought to england in 1875 it is questionable if 
the london market would ever have seen the gem but for the 
necessities of the burmese government wrote edwin w street a 
contemporary gem expert in burma the sale created intense 
excitement a military escort was considered necessary to escort 
the persons carrying the parcel to the vessel 
the gem was sold at sothebys in 1896 the buyer was reputed 
to be an important indian gem connoisseur acting on behalf of a 
royal indian family according to a note by gem expert benjamin 
zucker printed in the catalog for tuesdays sale

the senate on tuesday voted to ban disposal of 
sewage sludge in the atlantic ocean after 1991 
the measure passed by voice vote would set a dec 31 1991 
deadline for dumping in the atlantic by nine authorities in new 
york and new jersey 
the bill would impose stiff fines aimed at making the dumping 
prohibitively expensive and use penalty fees to pay for 
alternatives 
todays action means that ocean dumpers have to find 
alternatives to using the sea as the worlds biggest garbage pail 
or face fines and penalties said sen frank lautenberg dnj 
a principal sponsor of the legislation 
the measure reconciles differing sludgedumping bills passed by 
the senate in august and by the house earlier this month 
a house vote on the compromise could come as soon as wednesday 
with president reagan then expected to sign the bill 
some 8 million tons of sludge a year are dumped by the nine 
agencies at a site about 106 miles east of new jersey congress 
closed a site just 12 miles offshore in 1987 
the new bill would require dumpers to pay fees of 100 dollars 
per ton of sludge beginning next jan 1 
dumpers meanwhile would be required to negotiate with federal 
authorities on individual timetables for ending their dumping 
those agencies that cannot strike a deal would pay fees that 
rise from 100 a ton to 200 a ton by the end of 1991 any 
authority still dumping sludge in the ocean by the start of 1992 
would have to pay penalties in addition to the fees 
those fines would begin at 600 per ton and rise by 11 percent a 
year for continuing violators rising to total tens of millions of 
dollars 
congress originally banned ocean sludge dumping as of 1981 but 
that deadline was suspended in a successful lawsuit by new york 
the original deadline was set in a 1978 law after which some 300 
industries and 100 municipalities stopped dumping 
the proposed ban initially was opposed by new york officials 
who complained that the deadline would be impossible to meet 
but the opposition weakened as a bipartisan coalition of east 
coast lawmakers rallied in favor of a ban

opposition deputies on tuesday urged the improvement 
of equipment on italian runways following the crash of a uganda 
airlines jetliner while trying to land at romes main airport in 
heavy fog 
thirtyone of 52 people aboard were killed in the disaster early 
monday which occurred when the boeing 707 swept in low from the 
sea struck two houses and trees and smashed into a field a few 
hundred yards from a runway which lacked sophisticated landing 
guidance equipment 
investigation of the crash revolved around a number of questions 
raised by airport officials and pilots 
did the pilot miscalculate the altitude or angle of descent 
did the altimeter the instrument that measures altitude fail 
did the pilot misunderstand instructions from air traffic 
controllers or receive bad advice 
did a bank of fog suddenly roll across the runway robbing the 
pilots vision 
ugandas transport minister arrived in rome tuesday to join an 
investigation led by the italian transport ministry a separate 
investigation will be conducted by italian magistrates 
crucial to the probe will be tapes of cockpittower 
conversations and an examination of the black box instrument 
recordings found by rescuers 
stefano rusconi who directs the technical division of the 
italian pilots union said on state television that other airlines 
had decided to divert flights late sunday night from the fogbound 
leonardo da vinci airport 
he also noted that the runway the ugandan pilot was aiming for 
is one of two runways at the airport without the instrument landing 
system which gives pilots information about their altitude four 
of the main runways are equipped with the system 
three communist party parliamentary deputies appealed to the 
transport and interior ministries for immediate administrative 
measures to ensure that all runways in italy have the landing 
guidance euipment 
rusconi said italian pilots have complained frequently about 
italian airports that dont have the most uptodate devices 
hospitals treating survivors reported that at least two of the 
21 injured victims were in serious condition one was identified as 
victoria komukyeya described as a ugandan princess from toro a 
former kingdom in western uganda 
among those reported in good condition was 8monthold richard 
gait and his parents geoffrey and ruth of bath england who 
escaped from the burning plane with minor injuries 
the british embassy in rome identified two britons among the 
dead as manjeet dhillon who also held nigerian citizenship and 
kara ibrahim noor mohamed a native of bolton england their ages 
were not available 
among the dead were six ugandan members of the flight crew 
including the pilot and copilot 
by late tuesday neither the airline nor ugandan government 
officials in rome had released a list of the dead

sentence of former foreign minister clodomiro almeyda allowing the 
socialist politician to be freed after 15 months political 
imprisonment 
opposition parties called for almeydas release last week 
saying it would represent a goodwill gesture by president augusto 
pinochet

rule to 1997 and the triumphant opposition is pressing for 
democratic reforms it says are needed for a transition to elected 
civilian rule

about 100 supporters he declared his decision to join the 
struggle of the chilean people to recover full democracy 
almeyda president of the united left a fiveparty alliance 
was sentenced to 541 days for violating internal security laws by 
making antigovernment statements the court cut that sentence to 
390 days less than the time already served 
almeyda 65 was foreign minister under marxist president 
salvador allende whose elected government was toppled by pinochet 
in a 1973 military coup he served briefly as acting president 
during a trip abroad by allende who died in the takeover 
imprisoned after the coup and later expelled almeyda 
disregarded an official ban on his return and reentered chile in 
march 1987 he was quickly jailed and senteced to three months 
internal exile in a small southern town 
after that exile ended in june a federal court convicted him of 
apology of violence stemming from his verbal attacks on the 
pinochet government and sentenced him to prison 
last december he was politically banned for 10 years for 
allegedly violating a constitutional article banning promarxist 
statements and propaganda

been a favored project of ruling institutional revolutionary party 
pri administrations for the past 20 years 
the government calls the project proof of mexicos technical 
ability 
although the plant is usdesigned much of the construction has 
been done by mexican firms 
the commission said the laguna verde reactor would not begin 
commercial operation until it has operated at 100 percent 
efficiency for 100 continuous hours the government has said the 
tests could take six months 
there have been protests near the plant and in the cities of 
veracruz and xalapa the state capital since the government

many parents in palma sola a town only five miles from the 
plant kept their children out of school to protest the decision 
the mexico city newspaper excelsior said tuesday 
antinuclear groups have urged the government to reconsider its 
decision and vowed to continue their protests 
they claim the plant is obsolete and dangerous and question the 
need for nuclear power in oilrich mexico 
gonzalo martinez corbala a pri congressman and president of the 
chamber of deputies energy commission has accused the critics of 
distorting the facts and spreading misinformation 
he rejected the idea of a public referendum on nuclear power

ptl founder jim bakker said tuesday he is 
fighting for his life in his defense against a 52 million lawsuit 
accusing him his wife and a former aide of mismanaging the 
ministry he left in disgrace 
bakkers work for the ministry with its television programs and 
heritage usa religious theme park was praised in court by a former 
member of the ptl board who said bakker deserved his high salary 
and every bonus he received 
and the evangelists former financial secretary testified that 
he reimbursed the ministry for personal expenses that were paid for 
out of ptl funds 
during a lunch break at the trial in us bankruptcy court 
bakker said of the case it may be business as usual for everyone 
else but this is my life im talking about he called it 
literally a trial for my life 
in the first week of the trial held last month ptls current 
managers presented testimony and evidence that bakker received 
millions of dollars in bonuses and salaries 
the ministry went into chapter 11 bankruptcy seeking protection 
from creditors while it reorganized in june 1987 three months 
after bakker resigned in a sexandhushmoney scandal 
in testimony tuesday pastor evelyn spencer of the house of 
truth church in oakland calif said that she and other ptl board 
members consistently voted unanimously in favor of bonuses for 
bakker 
if a bonus came up i voted for it said ms spencer who 
was on the board from november 1985 to march 1987 when the board 
resigned 
according to irs figures presented in court bakker received 
278000 in salaries in the fiscal year ending in may 1987 plus an 
additional 1167000 in bonuses in that year 
bakker was to testify tuesday but that was postponed a day to 
allow him time to review canceled checks and reimbursement vouchers 
that were supplied to his attorneys monday 
bakker said he was a touch angry that he was only now 
receiving information he needs to defend himself and hinted at 
intentional sabotage i think somebody calculated they would hold 
all the materials until the middle of the trial he said though 
he did not say who 
and he predicted his research would satisfy at least 90 percent 
of the irss concerns 
also testifying tuesday was independent financial analyst james 
wilson who said ptls finances from 1978 to 1986 showed it to be a 
healthy growing ministry without financial problems 
according to wilson the ministrys fixed assets grew at an 
annual compound rate of 28 percent during that time while revenues 
increased 19 percent 
under crossexamination by ptl attorney tom white ms spencer 
could not recall the precise salary of bakker during her time on 
the board 
everything you can get your hands on would be fair judge 
rufus reynolds asked ms spencer about bakkers compensation ms 
spencer denied that 
also testifying was patricia harrison bakkers former financial 
secretary who said her job was to keep his personal expenses 
separate from the ministrys money she said she routinely wrote 
reimbursement checks to the ministry for bakkers expenses 
but she said former bakker aide david taggart also a defendant 
frequently received cash advances for himself and bakker for which 
she never saw documentation taggart told her he kept that 
documentation at home she said 
an irs agent also testified he found cash advances to bakker and 
taggart that apparently served no legitimate business purpose

in a city park 
the committee had sought to erect a statue of brace beemer the 
original lone ranger radio show narrator and the fourth voice of 
the lone ranger in the 1940s but fell far short of the 75000 
that would have been needed for the monument committee members 
said

the senate granted electionyear benefits to 
one of the nations largest interest groups tuesday when it 
approved bills elevating the veterans administration to a cabinet 
department and granting veterans the right to have courts review va 
denial of benefits 
both measures were approved on voice votes the measure creating 
the new cabinet department now goes to president reagan who is 
expected to sign it while the judicial review plan must be 
returned to the house for approval 
the senate also passed on a voice vote a bill granting a series 
of costofliving increases in a variety of va payments the house 
has yet to act on its version of that legislation 
the department of veterans affairs would be the 14th cabinet 
seat and the fifth created since 1960 the house passed the bill by 
voice vote oct 6 
backers of the change said the veterans administration already 
has the fifthlargest budget among federal agencies and giving it 
cabinet status will assure that the money is spent properly 
the va with an annual budget of 30 billion serves 27 million 
veterans and 49 million dependents or survivors it will pay out 
about 14 billion this year in income maintenance and 626 million 
for education and rehabilitation assistance in the current fiscal 
year 
the agency and its 240000 employees administer about 90000 
patient beds in 534 health facilities and va doctors will see about 
20 million outpatients this year it runs 109 national cemeteries 
and will bury 300000 veterans in the next 12 months 
according to the congressional budget office switching the va 
to a cabinet department will cost 33 million over five years most 
of that will be spent on changing signs on va buildings 
the second major piece of legislation gives veterans for the 
first time in 170 years the right to ask federal courts to review 
va denials of benefits 
the bill creates a new us court of veterans appeals and 
abolishes the current board of veterans appeals that panel is 
part of the va and is now the last resort of veterans who are 
unhappy with decisions to reject their claims 
the measure also eliminates a civil warera law which limits 
attorneys fees for veterans claims to 10 per claim that made it 
difficult for veterans to hire lawyers other than those provided by 
the va 
sen alan cranston dcalif chairman of the senate veterans 
affairs committee called the measure a historic advance in 
veterans rights 
the house approved somewhat similar legislation on oct 3 by a 
4000 vote but there were minor differences between that proposal 
and the senate package the senate bill will now be returned to the 
house for another vote 
the benefits increase legislation provides that 22 million 
veterans with serviceconnected disabilities and 310000 widows and 
orphans will receive the same costofliving increases paid to 
social security recipients 
the house is expected to pass its own version which would 
provide a specific 41 percent increase according to cranston the 
senate will undoubtedly concur with the house proposal he 
predicted 
the senate added an amendment which could provide interim health 
care payments to some of the vietnam veterans who were exposed to 
agent orange a highly toxic defoliant used by the united states in 
southeast asia 
the measure provides a presumption of service connection 
under which the va would assume that two types of cancer 
nonhodgkins lymphoma and softtissue sarcoma were caused by 
agent orange veterans could receive benefits while the us 
government which hasnt finally agreed that agent orange caused 
cancers studies the problem 
sen john kerry dmass a vietnam veteran said agent orange 
provisions will have a very limited effect 
i find it highly disturbing that those people who went to 
fight the vc viet cong in vietnam spend too much time fighting 
the va back here in this country kerry said 
before passage the senate approved 4715 an amendment to 
permit the va to offer vietnamera veterans flight training courses 
under the auspices of the gi bill 
sen tom daschle dsd the sponsor said airline deregulation 
has created vacancies among pilots and there will be thousands of 
pilot jobs to be filled in the next decade 
but critics said the program was offered on a trial basis in 
past years and hadnt worked

wildfires were slowed tuesday by lower 
temperatures and diminished winds after burning more than 7300 
acres and an exotic animal refuge and ancient sequoia trees were 
put out of immediate danger 
the good news came after nearly 2000 firefighters attacked two 
big blazes with waterdropping helicopters and ground crews that 
cut fire lines around the threatened animals and trees 
the divide fire in the angeles national forest 30 miles 
northwest of los angeles had burned 4110 acres by tuesday but 
stopped advancing toward the wildlife waystation a shelter for 
1000 exotic animals that have been abandoned or wandered into 
neighborhoods 
its still a longrange threat cautioned robert brady a 
spokesman for the us forest service 
it looks like we have survived this one well weve made it 
said martine colett owner of the shelter my face is a picture 
of wonderfulness 
the lions tigers giraffes jaguars horses alligators and 
other animals housed at the shelter became agitated as smoke and 
ashes surrounded the area and airplanes buzzed overhead but they 
calmed down tuesday as the fire slowed she said 
ms colett praised the firefighters who worked to clear an area 
around the shelter and set a backfire to burn brush down the 
mountain toward the fire she said 
the fire started by a 10yearold boy playing with matches 
burned in inaccessible mountain terrain and was 50 percent 
contained tuesday with full containment expected wednesday evening 
two of the 1030 firefighters battling the blaze suffered minor 
injuries 
in the sequoia national forest 125 miles north of los angeles 
lower temperatures of 70 degrees and winds 3 to 10 mph aided 
firefighters battling a 1900acre brushfire that threatened 
2700yearold sequoia trees in the 3squaremile giant forest 
firefighters quickly extinguished a flareup tuesday morning 
near the grove of trees which are considered the largest living 
things on earth 
although the trees were out of immediate danger the threat 
remained 
the fire which officials believe was started by a careless 
camper or smoker was 20 percent contained tuesday but no estimate 
was given on full containment four of the 930 firefighters on the 
blaze suffered minor injuries

rightwing christian legislators 
boycotted a voting session that was to elect a new speaker of 
parliament tuesday and a lawmaker said his colleagues were 
dancing on the grave of lebanon 
the failure to elect a successor to hussein husseini a shiite 
moslem whose oneyear term ended sunday sparked a new feud between 
christians and moslems 
in the absence of the 39member quorum required to extend 
husseinis term or elect a new speaker the 26 moslem deputies who 
showed up for the voting session declared husseini a caretaker 
speaker until a successor can be elected 
the christian deputies countered by issuing a statement 
rejecting husseini a staunch ally of syria and naming their own 
speaker pro tempore kazem khalil 88 the eldest deputy among the 
76 members of parliament 
this is the fatal blow said khalil a westernoriented 
shiite who lives in christian east beirut were actually dancing 
on the grave in which we have buried lebanon 
lebanon has been without a head of state since president amin 
gemayels sixyear term ended sept 22 and no successor was elected 
because parliament could not gather the necessary quorum 
two rival governments one moslem and one christian have since 
emerged splitting the army and security forces along religious 
lines 
newly arrived us ambassador john mccarthy made his first visit 
to the foreign ministry tuesday apparently to smooth tensions 
after he was criticized by the ministrys director general farouk 
abillamaa for not presenting his credentials to the christian 
government of army commander gen michel aoun 
i came to see the directorgeneral to discuss basically the 
general state of relations between lebanon and the united states 
mccarthy told reporters after the meeting at the building in east 
beirut 
mccarthy took up his post sept 24 two days after the 
expiration of gemayels term he has been meeting almost daily with 
christian and moslem leaders 
mccarthy has declared he will present his credentials only to 
the newly elected president not to aouns cabinet or the rival 
government of incumbent acting prime minister salim hoss a 
syrianbacked sunni moslem 
when the moslem deputies arrived for the 11 am session at the 
parliament in syrianpoliced west beirut sniper fire crackled 
overhead and some of the men were seen ducking for cover as they 
approached the building in the devastated city center 
police said the bullets probably were fired by christian 
militiamen hiding in battlescarred apartment buildings nearby 
the naming of husseini as caretaker speaker is essential to 
preserve the integrity of the legislative authority especially at 
a time when the top executive post remains vacant the moslem 
legislators said 
the christians justified their boycott of tuesdays session by 
declaring the area near parliament unsafe they demanded the 
session be shifted to villa mansour a twostory building near 
beiruts dividing green line that has served as temporary 
headquarters for the parliament since 1976 
the christians boycotted three previous parliament sessions 
called for aug 18 sept 22 and sept 23 to elect a successor to 
gemayel 
minutes before he bowed out 26 days ago gemayel a maronite 
catholic named aoun then army commander and also a maronite 
prime minister of a caretaker military cabinet 
but moslems claimed aouns appointment violated an unwritten 
national agreement dating to lebanons independence from france in 
1943 under which the president has always been a maronite the 
prime minister a sunni and the speaker of parliament a shiite 
the moslems pledged allegiance to the incumbent cabinet of sunni 
moslem prime minister salim hoss

critics accused the foreign secretary 
of deceiving his people for signing a new agreement o us military 
bases but president corazon aquino said the pact enhances 
philippineus relations 
the accord signed monday in washington by secretary of state 
george shultz and philippine foreign secretary raul manglapus 
allows the united states to use six military bases in the 
philippines until 1991 
he has sold out his country and grossly deceived his people 
the national malaya daily said of manglapus for these treasonous 
acts he ought never to show his face again in manila 
critics said the accord could prompt even stronger opposition to 
usrun clark air base subic bay naval base and four smaller 
garrisons 
the general perception is that the philippines got the short 
end of the deal and this perception is expected to be exploited by 
the antibases bloc to further fan the wave of antiamericanism in 
the country wrote columnist alvin capino in wednesdays issue of 
the philippine daily globe 
under the agreement the us government will pay the 
philippines 962 million a year for the use of the bases the 
philippines had demanded 12 billion a year 
we asked for 12 boxes of delicious apples they gave us four 
small bags of peanuts said sen ernesto maceda chairman of the 
senate defense committee 
he called the payment a publicly unacceptable compensation 
package certainly strengthens the hand of those who are batting for 
no extension after 1991 
senators on tuesday debated whether the pact required their 
approval in accordance with a constitutional provision on 
international agreements but were unable to resolve the issue and 
postponed discussion to a later date 
i think many people even those who are probases were 
disappointed by the outcome so that would even help our cause 
said sen wigberto tanada a leading opponent of the bases and 
principal sponsor of a senate bill banning the presence of nuclear 
arms in the philippines 
the pact allows the united states to maintain its policy of 
neither confirming nor denying the presence of nuclear weapons in 
aircraft and ships visiting the bases 
although us policy was upheld mrs aquino said a 
constitutional ban on nuclear weapons on philippine territory is 
being implemented since the storage of such arms here requires 
government consent 
the philippine constitution approved in 1987 adopts a policy 
of freedom from nuclear weapons consistent with the national 
interest legal experts say the phrase falls short of an outright 
ban 
the agreement reaffirms the enduring bilateral relationship 
between our respective countries and allows us to proceed to 
improve other aspects in that relationship mrs aquino said in a 
statement 
communist guerillas whose demand for the removal of the bases 
has fanned a 20yearold rebellion accused the goverment of 
shamelessly selling out philippine sovereignty 
we call on the filipino people to reject this new agreement 
and hold president corazon aquino accountable for this act of high 
treason the outlawed communist party of the philippines said in 
a statement 
the accord ends a nearly sevenmonth review of the 1947 
agreement governing the us bases in the philippines which are 
the largest in the pacific

south korean president roh taewoos proposal 
for ending four decades of rivalry and conflict with north korea is 
being praised by a senior us official as an imaginative and 
constructive policy of reconciliation and accommodation 
the united states plans in a few days to announce changes in 
american policy toward north korea in a new effort to lower tension 
on the korean peninsula going back to the 195053 korean war the 
official said tuesday 
us policy toward north korea is currently under review in 
consultation with south korea and changes probably will be 
announced soon after rohs talks with president reagan at the white 
house thursday the official added the source briefed reporters on 
korean issues and the forthcoming reaganroh meeting on condition 
he not be identified 
dramatic change should not be expected in us policy toward 
north korea because after all were talking about a state which 
we have officially characterized as terrorist he said but the 
united states wants to take some steps which we hope will be in 
conformity with president rohs desires and the desires of the 
korean people to ease the tensions on the peninsula and to create 
an atmosphere which will allow for a peaceful resolution of the 
differences that exist there he said 
the united states put north korea on its list of terrorist 
countries in january citing evidence that north korean agents were 
responsible for blowing up a korean air lines jet near off burma 
last november in which 115 people died the move cancelled an 
earlier relaxation of rules against informal us contacts with 
north korea diplomats 
the changes under discussion cover matters other than diplomatic 
contacts and trade the source said declining further details 
us policymakers are not giving south korea veto power over 
us decisions the official said its going to be our 
determination where we go and how far we go but were certainly 
not going to upset the close relations between south korea and 
the united states he said 
the source said officials have no trouble at all with the 
idea of crossrecognition under which south korea would be formally 
recognized by north koreas allies china and the soviet union 
while the united states japan and other friends of south korea 
would recognize north korea 
he did not comment however on rohs proposal to stage a peace 
conference among the united states the soviet union china japan 
and the two koreas 
north korea has staunchly resisted the kind of crossrecognition 
used for more than a decade with east and west germany on the 
grounds that it would perpetuate division of the country

were killed in the town absolutely false 
at 9 pm edt joan was centered near latitude 113 north 
longitude 772 west the national hurricane center in coral gables 
fla said in a statement it said the hurricanes center was about 
310 miles southeast of san andres and 225 miles northeast of colon 
panama joan was moving westward between 5 and 10 mph and little 
change was expected overnight 
maximum sustained winds were near 95 mph and satellite 
photographs indicated joan the fifth hurricane of the atlantic 
season might be strengthening in the next day or two 
a hurricane watch was in effect for the north coast of panama 
from punta san blas to boca del toro and for san andres 
both costa rica and panama were on a state of alert 
the costa rican government evacuated homeless elderly people and

possible landfall 
joan is one of a kind said jim gross a meteorologist at 
the national hurricane center you just dont see many hurricanes 
that take this course and hug the coast 
mark zimmer another meteorologist at the hurricane center said 
there was strong potential for flash floods in costa rica when joan 
comes ashore 
zimmer said winds could be near 100 mph when it hits the coast 
and depending on how much populated area there is where the storm 
does hit land there could be wind damage 
heavy rain began tuesday morning in costa ricas capital of san 
jose and eladio zarate director of the countrys national 
meteorological institute said there could be flooding on the 
atlantic coast overnight 
in nicaragua where it had been raining for several days 
officials were less certain we cant say if the storm will 
directly affect nicaragua at this moment said pilar cruz 
director of nicaraguas national meteorological service 
as a tropical storm with 45 mph winds joan slowly built its 
strength as it skimmed colombias coast baffling forecasters who 
had predicted it to weaken 
it reached hurricane force monday night when maximum sustained 
winds reached 74 mph and its center began to become better defined 
a sign the system could intensify over open water into the western 
caribbean forecasters said 
joan became the 10th named storm of the 1988 atlantic hurricane 
season when top winds passed 39 mph on oct 11 
gilbert the most devastating hurricane in recent years left 
more than 300 people dead and caused billions of dollars damage as 
it tore through jamaica the cayman islands and mexicos yucatan 
peninsula last month

a routine repainting job led to the discovery 
of a footlong crack in an aging continental airlines boeing 737 
five months after the government had ordered special inspections to 
look for such flaws 
a spokesman for continental confirmed that the large crack as 
well as 29 smaller ones were discovered near a window of the 
firstclass section after paint was stripped from the plane in 
preparation for repainting oct 5 
the cracks stretched about 30 inches along a joint where 
sections of metal skin overlap according to investigators of the 
national transportation safety board whose metallurgists are 
examining the section 
ntsb chairman james kolstad called it a chilling discovery 
in a speech monday to an aviation group in montreal and said it was 
frightening because the cracking was found in the same 
general area where an aloha airlines plane broke apart last april 
while in flight

george bush and michael dukakis have resorted to what the 
republican calls silly things from exchanging stares with the 
three little pigs to riding an m1 tank to get the ultimate in 
exposure a free minute on the network news 
the job of making that picture and sound bite irresistible to tv 
producers falls to imagemakers for the two presidential candidates 
these imagemakers exert control over what gets seen on 
television by confining reporters and camerasound crews to a 
twilight zone close enough for cameras but too far away for 
microphones to pick up any unscripted speech 
the result often enough pictures of flagdraped campaign 
rallies with the candidates offering snappy oneliners but no clear 
discussion of the issues 
thats life says richard salant former president of cbs 
news almost everything except natural disasters are done to a 
greater or lesser extent to draw the attention of the media 
the influence of television in the political arena goes by the 
numbers 
at this time of year the three network newscasts reach more 
than 25 million american homes every night 
deduct station breaks and commercials and the three network 
newscasts have about 22 minutes to cover the world 
one minute during one network news show costs a commercial 
sponsor 90000 making that oneminute splash on all three news 
shows the campaigns call it free media is a windfall worth 
more than a quarter of a million dollars 
to get their share of that limited time campaigns must 
outguess the producer in terms of whats going to be important 
says robert j murphy abcs vice president for television news 
coverage 
whats new is the next logical step from the point of view of 
the campaign manager once you get your view in how do you keep 
everything else out of it he said thats what the reagan 
administration has done very effectively and thats now what 
campaign managers are being judged on 
the managers especially the bush managers are being judged in 
some quarters as entirely too effective 
more than ever before the whole campaign is in the control of 
imagemakers says salant 
bush who has many of the same advisers who worked with reagan 
has used his status as a sitting vice president to produce some 
striking images in the campaign he was shown witnessing the 
destruction of the first us missiles under the treaty with the 
soviet union and greeting the discovery astronauts after the space 
shuttle landed in california 
dukakis sought to turn that around unleashing a series of 
television commercials on the packaging of george bush 
the democratic presidential candidate also has tried to use 
free media to his own advantage 
just this week dukakis borrowed a trumpet and played a few bars 
of happy days are here again it was a madefortv visual and 
sound bite but one that may have backfired because it was coupled 
with reports showing dukakis dropping in the polls 
during a recent campaign stop in illinois bush acknowledged 
we all do silly things in campaigns 
i wish you could have been with me out there in disneyland 
he said i was standing there and these three little pigs kept 
staring at me so i know what it is to be on the receiving end and 
do dumb things 
but the one that takes the cake was him riding around in that 
tank the governor of massachusetts in that tank bush said 
dukakis ride in an m1 tank across a grassy field in michigan 
on sept 13 was undertaken to respond to bushs charges that he was 
soft on defense 
roger ailes media adviser to richard nixon ronald reagan and 
now to bush has said that the news is much more important than 
advertising in defining a candidate it is ailes job and the job 
of his counterparts in the dukakis campaign to define the news 
what happens when control is threatened 
after the presidential candidates met in two debates with 
formats dictated by the two campaigns bush declined an offer by 
abcs nightline for a freeforall session with dukakis 
frankly our campaign schedule requires the candidate to be on 
the road after the second debate taking his message to the voters 
directly bush spokesman mark goodin explained he did not 
mention the minimum of 5 million households that tune in nightly to 
nightline 
robert a mossbacher sr bushs finance chairman has said that 
30 million to 35 million of the campaigns funds will go for 
television advertising the lions share of the 544 million it is 
allowed to spend overall 
the dukakis campaign has said it plans a comparable tv blitz 
its nobodys fault its whats happening with the times 
frederick koenig professor of social psychology at tulane 
university said of the campaigns heavy reliance on television 
koenig says studies showed voters in the past chose a candidate 
by picking up information from speeches and then discussing it with 
others i can remember growing up that people would sit around 
and argue politics sitting on their porches or in bars he said 
now in a time when the ac nielsen co says the average viewer 
has the tv set on for 6 hours 59 minutes per day and increasing 
numbers of families have more than one set people dont even 
discuss television shows with each other koenig said 
there has been a fragmentation of opinionforming he said 
at the same time the candidates are getting less time on the 
air 
voters used to hear halfhour and even onehour political 
speeches on radio or television said kathleen hall jamieson a 
professor of communications at the university of texas and author 
of packaging the presidency by 1964 she said 60second spots 
became popular and now the 30second spot is the norm 
network news executives believe long stories drive away 
audiences she said and that reinforces the publics expectation 
that it will get short stories 
there has been more substance in this campaign than is clear 
to people who are watching the network news jamieson said 
michael robinson associate professor of government at 
georgetown university says that suits voters too they have 
always been interested in brevity and we have this romantic notion 
that at some point the voters were really actively involved in the 
process they werent robinson says 
cbs correspondent bob schieffer who has traveled with the bush 
campaign said i think we do have to resist a pretty picture 
every so often schieffer said he drew the line on labor day when 
bush set out to help load fish in san diego 
i declined to use the pictures in my story because i thought 
it was silly because i didnt think it had anything to do with his 
qualifications to be president schieffer said 
jamieson said television still can help voters become deeply 
informed

the presidential candidates most evenings for example and public 
televisions macneillehrer newshour tackles issues in depth

a seldom mentioned consequence of the 
spectacular collapse of securities markets one year ago today is 
that it seems to have made almost anything sound plausible 
what for example 
well double digit inflation and interest rates another market 
collapse to 500 points on the dow jones industrial average 
depression or if you prefer the most stunningly strong economy 
you could ever imagine 
people out there are peddling all those notions and others and 
many of them are considered investment advisers no matter how 
their views might differ they share one belief in common fear 
sells 
consider this advertisement for richard c youngs international 
gold report how to cash in on the dukakis disaster amp let jesse 
jackson make you a millionaire 
the thesis is that dukakis and his cabinet member jackson 
would spend the nation into bankrupcty leaving gold as the only 
sane way for people to make money or protect what they already have 
what if bush wins 
in either case dukakis or bush the us dollar will hit 
the pits long before the economy goes thud bank on it inflation 
will settle in like lice on the body politic the ad says 
adrian day publisher of adrian days investment analyst claims 
to be the man who made more money for more people than any 
investment adviser in history but thats not the reason he is 
selling bad times 
im not writing just to tell you what a great guy i am he 
says but to warn you that the next couple of years will be 
tougher meaner and more treacherous than any period in the last 
two decades 
on the anniversary of the great stock market crash it isnt only 
the market letter writers who are offering unusual views some 
large brokerage houses are in effect and sometimes in words 
declaring that we are now in a new era 
the new era it is suggested calls for investments in sound 
values rather than in hot stocks a longterm rather than a 
shortterm view reasonable expectations a concern for fundamental 
values and the like 
but a new era the truth is that such concepts have never gone 
out of style except in some areas of the securities community 
they being fundamental to investing as opposed to trading 
economists also but perhaps to a lesser extent have had their 
thinking affected by the big collapse among some there appears to 
have developed a competition to find where the economys weak spots 
may be developing 
as a result falling unemployment and rising production 
repeatedly have been viewed with alarm more recently the 
recessionwatchers have shifted to inventory buildups and almost 
constantly retail sales are watched for signs 
perhaps the zaniest fear of all is that expressed by those who 
view the anniversary of the 1987 crash by itself as somehow 
capable of stirring up another disaster 
the economy meanwhile has performed as well as it possibly 
could given the problems of budget and trade deficits it has 
shown much more assurance steadiness restraint and sense of 
direction than have its observers 
it suggests oddly that the peddlers of fear and the extreme 
thinkers may be doing some good conceivably their reminders might 
have something to do with keeping the economy on the straight and 
narrow

paul simon who only stuffs basketball hoops 
from the bottom was down in the schoolyard with baseball legend 
mickey mantle sportscaster john madden and midget slamdunker spud 
webb playing stickball and basketball for the cameras 
a perfect two days of work he says to make a video of his old 
hit me and julio down by the schoolyard the song is one of 16 
on a new retrospective released this week by warner bros called 
negotiations and love songs it is his first album since 
graceland came out in 1986 
as one of pop musics most respected songwriters the 
grammywinning artist said he isnt repeating himself im not 
doing something over but on the other hand im developing ideas 
ive had for a long time 
in a recent interview at the hit factory studio where hes 
working on a percussionoriented album for release next summer 
simon talked about the new lp he said he selected certain tunes to 
demonstrate the best example of his work over the last 15 years 
after splitting with art garfunkel 
the songs appear in the order in which they came out on simons 
solo records starting with mother and child reunion and me 
and julio from his first solo lp paul simon in 1972 
i think it works better in terms of sound the instrumentation 
and recording techniques he said i think its less confusing 
to the ear than mixing them all up in my case 
he originally left out kodachrome which he described as a 
straightahead pop hit of the 70s then put it back on because 
people like it 
i tend to like later work better than earlier work as my 
skills develop he said and my outlook naturally is more 
synchronized with how i feel now if im talking about subject 
matter thats 15 years old thats what i thought 15 years ago the 
songs are like snapshots 
not only do his songs form lasting pictures of moments in his 
life but also reflect his artistic growth 
mother and child reunion is interesting to him because it 
was his first reggae piece me and julio has a caribbean flavor 
and he used brazilian percussion on it 
something so right marks his first meeting with the 
awardwinning producercomposermusician quincy jones who became a 
good friend jones did the arrangement on the tune 
st judys comet is a lullaby to his 16yearold son 
harper when he was a baby harper plays guitar and has come out 
of reggae into the grateful dead he also likes paul simon much to 
my surprise says his father 
another song on the new lp loves me like a rock represents 
simons interest in gospel music 
have a good time has sax player phil woods 50 ways to 
leave your lover was the first time he worked with steve gadd and 
the new york rhythm section 
i thought i made some of my best records with that rhythm 
section he said the 50 ways single also sold more than 1 
million copies 
still crazy after all these years was the 1975 grammy album 
of the year it also won best pop male vocalist for simon 
late in the evening is latin influenced im interested in 
that and working with that now he said on slip slidin 
away i worked with the oak ridge boys it was a movement toward 
country 
my hearts and bones album the one before graceland is 
not familiar to most people it didnt have any hit singles it was 
a very autobiographical album and a very serious somber album the 
songs i included from it i think are three of my best songs they 
werent released as singles 
the tunes are the title song train in the distance which 
includes the phrase negotiations and love songs and rene and 
georgette magritte with their dog after the war 
simon ends the lp with two songs from the grammywinning 
graceland album diamonds on the soles of her shoes and 
you can call me al graceland sold more than 3 million copies 
i just keep reviewing the elements ive been interested in 
from the 60s and even earlier simon said i heard latin and 
gospel music along with rock n roll when i was a kid growing up 
in new york those are the elements of my work early sounds that 
i really liked early rhythms that i remember 
you go back and you recapitulate and every time you 
reinvestigate it goes deeper and you begin to more clearly focus 
on what it is that you really respond to emotionally or musically 
and those are the elements that you keep 
because of that simon says his work becomes increasingly 
interesting what is not interesting is making top 40 hits if it 
happens it is just a pleasant surprise at the early point of my 
career simon and garfunkel everything was a hit and we wanted 
it to be 
when the 47yearold songwriter composes hes primarily 
concerned with his own generation and with an entire album instead 
of individual songs i want people to like it and find it 
interesting it doesnt necessarily have to be great numbers of 
people i want people to say i dont know how many people are 
going to like this but i like it 
simon wont tour with negotiations and love songs but may 
go out after next summers album 
i think in my case the music is better when you play it 
live he said a song takes a couple of days to make in a 
studio when youre playing that song for six months you start off 
copying the arrangement of the record most of the time it gets 
more interesting and more complex musically very often musicians 
work out things they didnt fully work out on the record date 
you usually have a bigger band there is room for soloists to 
play as a vocalist you have a chance to rethink the phrasing even 
the melody

in the twilight of president reagans 
administration he hasnt pulled off most of his social programs 
dear to the religious right but hes made them practically a 
political staple 
they simmer in the current national campaign and religious 
scholars say reagan has excelled at using his office as a bully 
pulpit for his upbeatstyle sermonizing 
the reagan years have been good for public theology despite 
its often thin quality writes church historian martin marty 
religion which had seemed a private affair in the 1970s went 
public again in the l980s 
marty of the university of chicago notes that in reagans 
presidency growing attention has centered on such issues as 
values virtue education moral formation sexuality family life 
abortion and euthanasia 
rabbi a james rudin of the american jewish committee writes in 
the christian century that reagan is clearly the dominant 
american theologian of the l980s 
but the content he adds is only sparkling optimisim 
theological perrier 
while reagan has not achieved most of his social agenda such as 
banning abortion reinstating prayers in schools and providing tax 
credits for children in private schools hes still preaching them 
theyre also backed by his partys candidate to succeed him 
george bush says reagan 
although we americans have done much to put our national life 
back on the firm foundation of traditional values there is still a 
great deal to be done 
he told a summer youth for christ rally in washington that as 
a nation we must embrace our faith for as long as we endeavor to 
do goodwe will find our strength our hope and our true 
happiness in prayer and the lords will 
although reagan rarely attends church himself he strikes his 
vintage religious chords he told the youths 
i would like someday to entertain an atheist at dinner and 
serve the most gourmet perfect dinner that has ever been served 
and then at the end of the meal ask that atheist if he believes 
theres a cook 
he said 4000 abortions a day must stop and he said vice 
president bush believes with me about it abortion is the 
taking of a human life 
so far we havent succeeded in persusading the congress to 
enact legislation that would once again permit voluntary prayer in 
americas schools he said but im convinced that one day 
soon such a measure will be passed 
in reagans term congress has repeatedly rejected measures to 
authorize school prayers give tax breaks for for private school 
tuition or to amend the constitution to overturn the supreme court 
decision allowing abortion 
some leaders of the religious right which had strongly backed 
reagan for the presidency have criticized him as not pushing hard 
enough for the measures suggesting he gave them only lip service 
while the christian right emerged as a political force in the 
1980s it is losing influence on the national level says 
historian leo ribuffo of george washington university 
however historian marty advices against underestimating it 
saying it did get people talking about the family and personal 
values 
he says it has gained legitimacy by adding scores of causes 
to its prime antiabortion cause and also has overcome objections 
to its involvement in politics 
by and large the new christian right won its point that it 
had a legitimate voice in politics marty writes in context his 
journal of commentary on religion and culture 
but he says the christian rightists did not win much in the 
reagan years they wanted less government and they got more they 
wanted less debt and ended up with the greatest ever they wanted 
dismantled social welfare programs and got some but it was 
selective 
however reagan asserted a major victory in the supreme 
courts recent upholding of an act allowing grants to religious 
groups to counsel the young against promiscuity 
on that subject he offered his advice to 9000 youths at their 
congress on evangelism saying its important for you not to pay 
any attention at all to all those who say that promiscuity is 
somehow stylish or rewarding 
he said the right thing to do is to wait for that one special 
person to be true in marriage he said you can start being 
true to that one special person beginning now 
reagan also took credit for the equal rights act giving 
religious groups the same right to meet after school the same as 
other clubs however schools are still refusing to do so 
challenging the law in court 
recalling a story of the countrys origins reagan played one of 
his frequent themes 
if benjamin franklin rose to invoke the almighty as the 
constitution itself was being drafted if the congress of the 
united states opens each day with prayer then isnt it time we 
let god back into the classroom

the roman catholic diocese of tucson says 
severe financial strain from continued ownership of television 
station kdtu has forced elimination of 14 jobs suspension of some 
services and imposition of salary cuts 
the financial resources of the diocese have been severely 
pressured by the continuing financial demands caused by the 
diocesanowned television station bishop manuel d moreno said 
in a letter to parishes 
he said efforts have failed over the last three years to sell 
the uhf station channel 18 which went on the air in 1984 and the 
continuing demands caused by its operations have forced 
reductions in diocesan services to parishes 
the bishop said the cutbacks however would not affect regular 
parish operations nor parish employees since parish budgets are 
administered independently he also said catholic community 
services catholic schools and cemeteries would be unaffected

viewers may tire of a mullah chanting 
from the moslem holy book but there is no alternative when hes 
on the government runs television in pakistan and uses it as a 
watchdog of islamic morality 
pakistan television has prepared interesting programs 
reflecting islamic social values for the octobertodecember 
quarter program director zaheer bhatti told the government news 
agency 
in an interview with the associated press he said that should 
not be interpreted as fundamentalist or reactionary 
bhatti dismissed the selfrighteous view of western television 
as a sinkhole of promiscuity alcoholism and drug addiction but 
also said there are basic differences between east and west moslem 
and nonmoslem 
we want to make the young aware of the positive values in 
our society he said we dont see the past of any society as a 
separate entity it is a progression and we say we are a 
progressive religion 
television is a tool for preserving pakistani culture bhatti 
said and mentioned such things as keeping traditional dress from 
being supplanted by tshirts jeans and threepiece suits 
weekly television series display the cultures of pakistans five 
provinces love is a common theme with the young in search of love 
often pitted against an older generation clinging to the tradition 
of arranged marriages 
we dont believe in sermonizing through the box bhatti 
said we do not talk down to people we talk to people 
a series called waris was a favorite of the late president 
mohammed zia ulhaq 
it was set in the interior of punjab province and told of a 
powerful dictatorial landowner who clashed with his sons and 
tenants 
some pakistanis said the landlord was intended as a portrayal of 
former prime minister zulfikar ali bhutto who was hanged in 1979 
two years after gen zia overthrew him in a mlitary coup 
bhuttos daughter benazir now leads the pakistan peoples party 
which was founded by her father and is the main political 
opposition 
about two months before his death in a plane crash aug 17 zia 
announced that pakistan would adopt islamic law 
women protested in the streets feeling their hardwon gains 
would slip away and whether to implement islamic law now will be 
left to the government organized after elections nov 16 
subtle changes began occuring on pakistan television after zias 
pronouncement and continued after his death 
fewer women were seen on the tube particularly in commercials 
and more covered their heads women anchoring the evening news wore 
headscarves 
bhatti acknowledged the number of women in commercials has been 
reduced 
glamorous women in skintight dresses slipping into the latest 
car never were part of pakistani television but bhatti said even 
tamer depictions of women to sell products is being reduced 
if a product is for use by either men or women a man will 
appear in the ommercial he said and the unnecessary use of 
females to sell products will be stopped 
foreign programs will continue to appear because pakistans 
television industry cannot produce enough programs to fill the 
time but officials are selective he said 
dramas are included but the emphasis is on such educational and 
informative programs as documentaries by jacques cousteau and the 
national geographic society

is there life after the phantom of the opera 
for michael crawford 
emphatically yes says the man who conquered broadway last 
season carting off every theater award in sight including a tony 
now crawford has left the cast of the new york production of 
phantom but even his departure from the hit musical was 
spectacular 
after missing more than a week because of a virus the star 
returned oct 8 for one final performance during curtain calls 
the entire cast showered crawford with red roses they were 
assisted by members of the audience some of them running down the 
aisles of the majestic theater to toss flowers on the stage 
an emotional crawford spoke to the theatergoers choking on what 
he said was the same thing he told his mother on his 21st birthday 
id like to thank you for having me he told the cheering 
crowd 
youre perfection yelled one enthusiastic woman 
but crawford has not hung up his phantom mask and put away 
his makeup for good the actor plans to do at least a ninemonth 
engagement beginning next may in the los angeles company of 
phantom its the best possible audition for the movies 
the film people are there and theyd see it he says i 
have got very strong interest and offers from two studios if im 
in los angeles i can work on development as it is happening 
crawford has made movies before film buffs know him from the 
knack a funny thing happened on the way to the forum 
hello dolly and how i won the war but this is the first 
time a movie will be planned around him what a difference a hit 
musical can make to a career 
i dont think i was known over here at all crawford says 
in england he was a star he appeared in several hit british 
television series and had done three big musicals in londons west 
end billy flowers for algernon and barnum the last 
show an american musical had an even longer run in england than 
it did in the united states 
it ran so long we had births and deaths in the audience 
crawford says people died and we had a woman give birth once 
it was like life aboard a 747 on an aroundtheworld trip 
phantom with the help of exposure on national television 
shows such as west 57th street has made his face familiar to 
fans in the united states 
when i first opened in phantom in new york even the stage 
managers would ask are you michael crawford he says before 
he left the show there were crowds of 50 to 60 people waiting each 
night at the stage door to see him 
and the letters never stopped coming every day he would receive 
more than 100 letters some from overseas and addressed simply 
michael crawford broadway usa 
crawfords most dedicated followers have been an informal group 
of britishers called the ogres which stands for opera ghosts 
return enthusiasts many of them came to new york for his final 
broadway appearance some had been here twice before unfurling 
banners down the majestic alleyway that proclaimed bring him 
home 
there are about 25 of them and they wont let anyone else 
join he says they are very exclusive and if anyone 
misbehaves they are out or if they bother me they dont like to 
annoy me they are very good to me 
crawford also has widened his appeal with his first solo 
recording songs from the stage and screen that he made before 
he opened phantom in new york 
they have sold over 200000 copies on the east coast so its 
on its way to gold he says and im very pleased there was a 
terrific amount of care gone into that record 
the album which includes a medley of songs from west side 
story and such broadway classics as if i loved you 
memory and youll never walk alone has sold well all over 
the world 
its triple platinum in new zealand which means it has sold 
20000 copies crawford says even the sheep are buying it 
crawford will go back into the recording studio early next year 
in london to record a second album this time a collection of love 
songs he hopes to include music of the night his big number 
from phantom if composer andrew lloyd webber grants his 
permission 
the performer also is considering several new broadway musicals 
although none he can talk about but its nice that ive been 
asked he says and one of them is of particular interest to 
me 
after his final performance in phantom a role now being 
played by timothy nolen crawford flew to australia to make a 
documentary film for a british charity then he may begin to relax 
for a few weeks 
crawford admits hell miss the hoopla that accompanied his 
10month phantom run in new york although there are tradeoffs 
ill be glad to have it quiet after all that attention he 
says you need that quiet whenever you have finished a show that 
is an event

in case george bush and michael dukakis want 
to talk about goats the agriculture department has some new 
material speechwriters can use no kidding it would be good for 
rebuttal too 
goats are among the most noncontroversial farm topics around 
they havent been involved in any huge usda subsidy flap and are 
not a big legislative issue on capitol hill 
moreover while city folk may have trouble identifying with 
modern feedlots that send beef to their tables or the farrowing 
pens that turn out pork chops and sausage just about everyone 
feels good about goats 
since before biblical times goats may have been the most 
useful of domesticated animal producing milk for drinking or for 
cheese gourmet meat cabrito leather and fiber for clothing 
cashmere or angora not to be confused with angora rabbit 
wool says the departments cooperative state research service 
the goat report is the latest in a series of singlesheet papers 
turned out by the agencys office for smallscale agriculture 
others include such topics as sheep mushrooms foliage plants 
herbs wildflowers and specialty vegetables 
goats are relatively clean and make fine pets and show 
animals the report said worldwide there may be as many 460 
million which produce an estimated 45 million metric tons of milk 
annually 
but before people quit the city job politics or other endeavor 
there are some things they should know about raising goats for a 
living or as a supplement to other income 
they of course need care to keep dogs away and skillful 
management to prevent diseases and internal as well as external 
parasites such as lice mites and fleas the report said goat 
milk is so respected that there have been people who began raising 
dairy goats before learning whether they could sell the milk or 
knew how to make cheese 
one problem is that in at least 21 states goat milk must be 
pasteurized or heated to a prescribed temperature to kill 
potentially harmful bacteria and pasteurization can cost a bundle 
for equipment 
where milk can be sold raw herds must be licensed and the 
nannies must be carefully tested and kept free of brucellosis and 
tuberculosis which are contagious to humans 
lest anyone sneer at someones plan to operate a goat ranch on a 
couple of acres beyond the zoning of outer surburbia goats have 
assumed something of a washington hauteur of late 
in 1987 for the first time congress and president reagan 
recognized the merits of the dairy goat proclaiming a national 
dairy goat awareness week 
president reagan it was said supported the idea 
enthusiastically and had recalled with fondness the time about 25 
years ago when each or our two doe goats had quintuplets on our 
ranch in california 
goats are raised for nondairy purposes such as for meat and 
leather or fine hair the report said farmers and ranchers who are 
already pasturing some sheep or cattle or both may be able to add 
some goats without any problems 
goats eat some plants that sheep and cattle dont seek so 
they are not mutually exclusive the report said they pasture 
well together 
the meat or cabrito sometimes called chevon has little fat 
and tastes better than venison the report said worldwide 
production is more than 12 million metric tons a year 
with a flock of 350 to 400 spanish does bob buckholz of 
dripping springs texas who raises goats for meat annually sells 
their offspring for meat at eight months of age for 30 a head 
the report said 
since the stock is tough thrifty and hardy he has lots of 
pasture and some pyrenees dogs to keep predators such as coyotes 
and wild dogs at bay buckholzs expenses are relatively small 
tom and helen hill lake butler fla sometimes feed young 
goats or kids only about two months until they reach 35 to 40 
pounds the young animals are then sold at nearly 1 a pound in the 
miami area where there is often a shortage of goats in november 
and december

others published so far write to office for smallscale

drexel burnham lambert inc will appeal a 
judges refusal to quit presiding over the governments massive 
civilfraud suit against the firm raising the prospect of more 
delays and pretrial theatrics in a case that already has acquired 
celebrity status in manhattan federal court 
although us district judge milton pollacks angry rejection 
monday of drexels move to disqualify him was seen outwardly as a 
setback for the wall street giant some attorneys following the 
courtroom battle saw it as a plus for the defense which is trying 
to portray drexel as a victim of prejudice 
you cant lose said one attorney who spoke on condition he 
not be identified this effort has to be for the purpose of 
creating the picture that drexel is a fine company mistreated by 
the courts 
pollack denied drexel motions to stop him from ruling on its 
case as well as in other cases involving the firm and ivan boesky 
the imprisoned inside trader who implicated drexel and others in 
alleged wrongdoing when he was exposed nearly two years ago 
pollack a respected 82yearold jurist who has been presiding 
over most boeskyrelated litigation for more than a year deemed 
the defense strategy to remove him a ludicrous timewasting ploy 
his opinion seemed to further raise the level of antagonism 
between drexel lawyers and the judge since the securities and 
exchange commission filed its wideranging fraud suit against the 
firm and other defendants last month 
pollack already has chastised several defense lawyers for their 
conduct in the case and referred two of them to the chief judge of 
manhattan federal court for possible disciplinary sanctions 
a raucous hearing last week on defense efforts to disqualify 
pollack on grounds of possible bias featured emotional exchanges 
between him and drexel attorneys who are among the most highly 
paid in the country that session drew a packed audience unusual 
in securities law cases 
sec lawyers applauded pollacks opinion monday and expressed 
eagerness to proceed private attorneys suing drexel and boesky 
also welcomed the ruling 
defense attorneys did not return telephone calls for comment 
but drexel spokesman steven anreder said in a statement our 
attorneys had a professional obligation to bring this issue before 
the court since it is their considered view that based on the 
facts in the motion judge pollacks position is incorrect the 
matter will be placed before the 2nd circuit court of appeals 
drexel claims pollack has a conflict of interest because his 
wife moselle stands to gain 30 million from the sale of her 
stock in palais royal inc a houstonbased concern going private 
in a transaction that indirectly involves drexel financing 
although mrs pollacks financial interest would make it appear 
that pollack is biased in drexels favor defense lawyers had 
argued they wanted a judge whose impartiality could not possibly be 
questioned by the public 
there is no financial or business connection or other 
relationship between mrs pollack and drexel the judge wrote 
there is simply no reasonable basis for doubting the courts 
impartiality in this case by reason of the palais royal stock sale 
no facts no rational basis have been supplied 
pollack wrote that drexels motion seemed so farfetched as to 
be ludicrous and hardly a basis for a judge to step aside 
privately many lawyers have speculated the drexel defense wants 
another judge because of pollacks reputation as a tough 
nononsense securitieslaw expert tending to side with the 
government in fraud cases 
legal experts familiar with courtroom strategies to disqualify 
judges doubted the drexel effort to remove pollack would prevail 
it is fairly common to use a motion to disqualify as sort of a 
diversion said arthur miller a professor at harvard law school 
sometimes the strategy is serious when there are reasons to 
fear the judge sometimes the motion is made because you dont like 
the judge miller said it generally fails miserably 
the sec sued drexel and four key employees of the firm sept 7 
alleging they secretly plotted with boesky to manipulate stock 
profit on inside information about corporate takeovers cheat 
clients and engage in other frauds the defendants have denied the 
charges

wall street was kept in the dark as the law 
requires before philip morris companies inc announced its 11 
billion bid for kraft inc 
the best evidence that there were no widespread leaks of the 
surprise takeover bid late monday is that trading in both stocks 
was about average and there were no big price changes the offer 
was announced after the close of trading 
small amounts of insider trading would not affect volumes or 
prices but a rumor that traveled far quickly would have pushed 
krafts stock price toward philip morriss offer of 90 a share 
and trading would have been heavy 
in consolidated new york stock exchange trading monday kraft 
stock rose 62 cents a share to 6012 philip morris stock rose 
137 a share to 100 
trading in kraft was 123100 shares less than the daily average 
volume of 232900 shares so far this month and 233548 shares so 
far this year 
trading in philip morris was 691800 shares slightly above the

in their latest attempt to win over interco inc 
shareholders the rales brothers sweetened their tender offer for 
the furniture and apparel maker to 284 billion 
through cardinal acquisition corp the washingtonbased sibling 
team of steven and mitchell rales on monday offered 74 a share in 
cash for each of intercos 384 million outstanding shares 
the offer tops the tender offer the duo launched in august by 4 
a share but also represents the fourth time the rales brothers 
have bid for the st louisbased company 
interco which rejected the earlier rales offers and instead 
unveiled a restructuring plan had no immediate comment on the 
latest bid said company spokesman carter dunkin 
the rales brothers made their first overtures to intercos 
management in july offering to acquire the company for 64 a 
share in august the group launched a tender offer at 70 a share 
which interco immediately rejected 
on sept 20 the brothers again were rebuffed after proposing a 
friendly merger at 72ashare that was conditioned on the company 
providing them with certain confidential information 
the sweetened tender offer was announced shortly before the 
close of trading on the new york stock exchange intercos stock 
closed at 7150 a share up 162 but still below cardinals 
latest offer 
cardinal said the offer would remain open until midnight oct 
31 unless extended however last week a federal appeals court in 
philadelphia ordered the brothers to keep their bid open pending a 
further ruling in litigation between cardinal and interco over the 
tender offer 
interco has filed suit against cardinal charging it violated 
federal regulations by failing to disclose that the investment firm 
drexel burnham lambert inc was a cobidder 
interco also charged that the proposed takeover violates federal 
regulations by being too highly leveraged 
at the time interco rejected the rales groups 72ashare bid 
the company unveiled a 28 billion restructuring and 
recapitalization program that interco said could include a sale of 
its ethan allen furniture unit and other businesses 
intercos other products include broyhill furniture london fog 
rainwear and florsheim and converse shoes 
the restructuring also includes payment of a special dividend of 
25 in cash and securities per share 
interco chairman harvey saligman said the restructuring plan was 
worth 76 a share 
the raleses have insisted on a chance to bid on any assets 
interco might put up for sale and warned of unfortunate 
consequences possibly legal action or a shareholder proxy fight 
if they are not consulted before any assets are sold

delchamps inc executives saying they wont 
be beaten bought or buried filed a lawsuit to halt a hostile 
takeover of the alabamabased grocery chain by aampp 
the great atlantic amp pacific tea co has offered 30 a share or 
210 million for delchamps which operates supermarkets in alabama 
florida louisiana and mississippi the latest offer marks the 
third time in two years that aampp has bid for the company 
in announcing the suit filed monday in us district court at 
mobile delchamps chairman a f delchamps jr called the aampp offer 
cheap 
the lawsuit accused aampp and others of failing to disclose 
potential violations of antitrust laws and failure to reveal an 
alleged plan to financially cripple delchamps even if it fails to 
buy the company 
delchamps said aampps motive was to either purchase the firm at 
a cheap price and proceed with its plan to achieve dominance in the 
gulf coast retail stores market or cause the firm to suffer high 
legal bills and induce a leverage buyout that would weaken 
delchamps as a competitor 
aampp has not been able to compete with us effectively in the 
marketplace so it has obviously decided if you cant beat them 
buy them or bury them with investment bankers and lawyers we 
dont intend to be beaten bought or buried delchamps said 
aampp spokesman michael rourke could not be reached for comment 
monday 
delchamps operates 102 grocery stores and six liquor stores 
aampp headquartered in montvale nj is 52 percent owned by the 
tengelmann group of west germany 
aampp made its first offer for delchamps in october 1986 another 
in october 1987 and another this month between the first and last 
attempts the offering price has risen from 23 to 30 a share 
delchamps stock was trading at 2650 a share in the 
overthecounter market monday afternoon up 50 cents from friday 
while aampps stock was down 37 cents at 4662 a share on the new 
york stock exchange 
delchamps had sales of about 700 million last year aampp had 
sales of 96 billion in 1987 from its 1170 stores in this

the next president will have to take 
major steps to turn around an economy destabilized by an entrenched 
budget deficit and policy flaws say economic advisers of varying 
political stripes in a harvard business review report 
in a set of eight papers experts from consumer activist ralph 
nader to nobel laureate paul samuelson offer the next president 
economic advice amid a presidential campaign that the magazine says 
has produced a lot of partisan noisiness but little serious 
deliberation 
theres a fundamental basic instability in the economic system 
right now harvard business review editor theodore levitt said 
monday summing up the papers 
the magazine had asked panel members to write memos advising the 
next president on a range of economic issues the 42page report 
will appear in the magazines novemberdecember issue 
the underlying conclusion a fundamental instability in the us 
economic system needs to be addressed indeed the federal budget 
deficit is so deeply rooted that it wont solve itself in the 
normal course of economic events 
samuelson a massachusetts institute of technology professor 
emeritus argues that fear of alienating voters has frightened 
away all candidates from even discussing vital economic issues 
the new president he says should spend his first year trying 
to reduce the deficit from about 3 percent of the nations 4 
trillion gross national product toward 2 percent and ultimately 
by 1992 eliminating all deficit that isnt cyclical 
a basic structural deficit is one that exists regardless of 
prevailing economic conditions so that public debt rises even 
after the nation returns to full employment cyclical deficits are 
tied to inflation unemployment and other economic conditions 
when asked how to tame a basic deficit one might answer 
prosaically by expenditure cuts and tax increases but 
samuelson says the new president needs to abandon the notion that 
the deficit can be reduced by either cutting spending or raising 
taxes or a 5050 combination 
the experts two of whom advise the presidential candidates 
democrat michael dukakis and republican george bush offer 
detailed advice for increasing capital formation modernizing the 
nations manufacturing base and overhauling public education 
tell the american people the truth that todays apparent 
prosperity is being borrowed from the future that our children 
will be angry and frustrated when they are left with a lower 
standard of living advises clyde v prestowitz jr a former 
counselor for japan affairs to the secretary of commerce 
nader a thorn in the side of big business for 25 years 
surprisingly argues that government can learn from business to 
become more efficient humane creative and responsive 
the next president should break through the legendary oval 
office cocoon to communicate regularly and directly with federal 
workers he says he should visit major departments mix it up 
with the employees listen to their ideas stimulate their thinking 
and remind them of the importance of their mission 
conservative economist martin feldstein a bush adviser 
counsels avoiding protectionist policies that some industries may 
press for during the long road back to trade balance 
if you accede to these pressures you would not only hurt 
american consumers and weaken the competitiveness of american 
industry but would also risk the start of a protectionist trade 
war he writes 
xerox corp chairman david t kearns cites research showing that 
if current demographic and economic trends continue us 
businesses will have to hire a million new workers a year who cant 
read write or count at an annual cost to industry of 25 million 
the us government spends more money on agriculture research 
than it does on education research its no wonder we know more 
about pork bellies and soybean futures than we do about our 
schools he said

new york says it will place a higher 
wihholding tax on bonuses commissions and other supplemental wages 
to make it harder for those in the financial services industry to 
evade taxes 
the state department of taxation and finance announced monday 
that starting jan 1 new york will hike its withholding tax to 
7875 percent from 5 percent on supplemental income sources unless 
taxpayers make prior arrangements to have withholding taxes figured 
at the same rate as regular wages 
state tax commissioner james wetzler said the change stems from 
a tax department investigation that turned up thousands of tax 
evaders at prominent wall street brokerages and investment houses 
including employees at drexel burnham lambert inc bear stearns amp 
co and shearson lehman hutton inc 
when arrests were made of some toplevel employees of those 
businesses in april former tax commissioner roderick chu said 
state officials were numbed and shocked at how widespread the 
tax cheating had become on wall street at that time chu said the 
state had found more than 5700 income tax evaders including 1519 
people with salaries of more than 50000 a year 
the probe revealed that many brokers and investment counselors 
were properly paying state income taxes on their regular salaries 
but they were found to be paying the 5 percent withholding tax and 
no more on the bonuses partnership distributions and other 
supplemental income they were receiving 
in many cases said tax department spokesman paul rickard 
nonsalary income is far larger than the regular pay the executives 
get 
rickard said he had no estimate of how much in taxes experts 
feel the state is getting cheated out of in that manner 
according to wetzler the changes on bonus and commission 
withholding is expected to bring the state about 55 million more 
in the fiscal year ending march 31 1989 and 90 million more in 
the fiscal year beginning the next day 
tax officials said the state has now matched a list of employees 
of 1100 banks investment firms and stock brokerages with a list 
of people not filing income tax returns rickard said 10000 
warning letters will be mailed by the tax department this week to 
people the state suspects of not properly filing returns 
according to the spokesman the state is continuing the process 
of settling accounts with those taxpayers found to be shortchanging 
the state this spring 
he said tax officials are expanding their probe to other fields 
where some workers earn big bonuses or commissions such as real 
estate

its unfortunate because a merger with eastern would have been 
very positive for twa but what will be will be he said in 
todays editions of the newspaper 
icahn reportedly notified frank lorenzo the chairman of 
easterns parent texas air corp on monday that he was unable to 
reach an understanding with easterns three unions over the weekend 
icahn had been negotiating for more than a week with lorenzo and 
easterns pilot and machinist unions although icahn never made a 
specific acquisition proposal last wednesday new york developer 
donald trump agreed to buy the eastern shuttle for 365 million in 
cash 
sources told the associated press on monday that the union talks 
broke down mainly because icahn was seeking wage concessions from 
the eastern unions that the union leaders considered too severe 
icahn got too greedy one union source told the journal 
the newspaper also reported that icahn negotiators became angry 
when twas machinist union tried to tie its forthcoming contract 
negoiations with the talks with eastern 
lorenzo reportedly had given icahn an exclusive right until the 
end of the week to make an offer for eastern to the texas air board 
of directors after that deadline other interested parties could 
come forward with offers 
texas air executives have indicated that moneylosing eastern 
minus its profitable northeast air shuttle would be worth around 
1 billion according to the new york times 
in addition to icahn other parties that have expressed an 
interest in buying the rest of eastern include twa president joseph 
corr who is a close associate of icahn and a group of major 
insurance companies the times said

a french professor whose visit to the 
united states during the depression sparked his interest in 
economics today won the nobel memorial prize in economic science 
the royal swedish academy of sciences said maurice allais 77 
won the award for his pioneering contributions to the theory of 
markets and efficient utilization of resources 
allais told reporters at his suburban paris home that the award 
was mindboggling 
my motivation when i was young was an idea of being able to 
improve the conditions of life to try to find a remedy to many of 
the problems facing the world he said 
thats what led me into economics i saw it as a way of 
helping people 
he was the first french economist to win the coveted award since 
it was created in 1968 americans have dominated the prize taking 
15 of the 25 awards since it was created by the bank of sweden 
five winners were british 
allais did his economic research at the ecole nationale 
superieure des mines de paris the academy said 
although his work is little known outside france allais is 
the most prominent figure in modern economic research in france as 
regards basic theory and applications to publicsector planning 
said the 300member academy in a statement 
jacques levy director of the ecole nationale des mines one of 
frances most prestigious institutions of higher education said 
allais was the mentor for everyone involved in the economy in 
postwar france between 1945 and 1968 
within the world of french economic thought after world war ii 
in which leftists and rightists agreed that the state should play a 
major role in the economy allais established a place for reliance 
on market forces 
allaiss work provided a very strong base for those opposed to 
government direction of the economy said jacques lautman 
scientific director for human sciences at frances national center 
for scientific research 
allais training was as an engineer but in the 1930s he 
visited the united states during the depression seeing factories 
idled and people unemployed 
this is what sparked him to consecrate his life to 
economics levy said 
the academy said allais greatest contributions came in the 
1940s with his work on market equilibrium and efficiency 
he published works in 1943 and 1947 detailing his theories 
which provided guidelines for using prices in monopolies and for 
public sector planning 
the son of a cheese store owner allais was born in 1911 in 
paris he is a professor of the center for economic analysis at the 
ecole nationale superieure des mines 
his works include frequency probability and chance the 
general theory of surplus and third world at the crossroads 
allais who has served in french governments in several 
positions and was named an officer of the legion of honor in 1977 
also wrote studies on history and physics 
he graduated at the top of his class from ecole polytechnique in 
1933 and then attended the ecole national superieure des mines 
until 1936 
allais joins three drug researchers from the united states and 
britain who became 1988 nobel laureates on monday for discoveries 
leading to medications for heart disease aids and other deadly 
illnesses 
robert m solow of the massachusetts institute of technology 
won the economics prize last year for creating a model showing how 
technology and other factors influence economic growth 
the economics prize is a late addition to the five awards 
established in the 1896 will of alfred nobel who bequeathed his 
fortune from the invention of dynamite to reward scientific 
breakthroughs activities for peace and literature of an 
idealistic tendency

the un peacekeeping forces were awarded the peace prize sept

manufacturing states which have lagged behind 
the national average in personal income growth during the 1980s 
began to close the gap in the year ended in june the government 
said today 
the commerce department said nonfarm personal incomes continued 
to grow fastest in the hightech industrial states of new england 
from the second quarter of 1987 to the second quarter of this year 
as they have through most of the current economic expansion 
from the end of the last recession in the third quarter of 1982 
and continuing through the apriljune period of last year incomes 
in the coastal regions new england far west southeast and 
midatlantic have grown faster than in the regions in the middle 
great lakes plains southwest and rocky mountain area 
the disparity has led administration critics to dub the current 
expansion the bicoastal economy 
however in the last year the mix has begun to change new 
england is still on top but great lakes and midatlantic states 
dependent on traditional heavy manufacturing are improving and 
income growth in the southeast and far west has cooled a bit 
for the united states as a whole the annual rate of nonfarm 
personal income growth for the year ended in june was 77 percent 
up from 71 percent in the earlier part of the economic expansion 
heres how the various regions fared 
new england 95 percent up from 87 percent 
midatlantic 87 percent up from 74 percent 
far west 78 percent down from 82 percent 
great lakes 77 percent up from 62 percent 
southeast 75 percent down from 79 percent 
plains 62 percent up from 59 percent 
southwest 58 percent up from 55 percent 
rocky mountain 52 percent up from 51 percent 
the commerce department attributed gains in the great lakes 
states to strength in the manufacturing of durable goods big 
ticket items expected to last three or more years and in 
construction it said the midatlantic region also benefited from a 
pickup in manufacturing 
growth in the southeast as a whole was down but by state it was 
mixed weak growth in incomes from service jobs in georgia and 
interior states more than offset strong growth in the atlantic 
coast states of florida north carolina virginia and south 
carolina 
economists have been anticipating gains in the socalled 
manufacturing rust belt of the nation the drop in the value of 
the dollar over the last three years has made us goods less 
expensive on overseas markets and has fueled a boom in export sales 
this year

british publisher robert maxwell said today he 
will appeal a delaware judges refusal to overturn a key element in 
macmillan incs buyout agreement with a rival suitor 
maxwell said he also planned to seek an order barring the 
consummation of the rival groups tender offer for the publishing 
and information services giant 
macmillan has agreed to a 25 billion buyout by the investment 
firm kohlberg kravis roberts amp co and macmillan senior management 
maxwell has offered 251 billion for macmillan under certain 
conditions and both sides have tender offers out that are 
scheduled to expire at 1201 am edt wednesday 
on monday jack b jacobs a judge in delaware chancery court in 
wilmington del denied maxwells request for an injunction 
against a lockup provision that macmillan granted kohlberg in 
case its buyout offer failed 
the provision gives the kohlberg group the right to buy four of 
macmillans businesses for 865 million should the merger fail to 
materialize 
maxwell who is making his bid through his maxwell communication 
corp had argued that the provision was unfair and said he would 
be willing to pay 900 million for the same units which include 
the berlitz language centers the directory division the direct 
marketing division and a division that publishes state legal codes 
but macmillan argued that the provision was needed to persuade 
the kohlberg group to raise its bid for the company 
in todays statement maxwell communication said it intends to 
appeal the courts decision and will move today in the appropriate 
courts for an injunction barring the consummation of kkrs tender 
offer and barring macmillan from entering into any transactions out 
of the ordinary course of business pending that appeal 
when the company concluded an auction for itself late last 
month maxwell offered 89 a share in cash for its 278 million 
shares while kohlberg offered 9005 a share in cash and 
securities 
macmillan agreed to the kohlberg offer but maxwell subsequently 
raised his offer to 9025 a share in cash 
jacobs said in his ruling that while the auction procedures 
were deficient in several respects the evidence is not 
sufficient to persuade the court that those infirmities were 
responsible in a legal sense for macmillan not receiving 
maxwells highest bid before the auction gavel fell 
the judge did grant maxwells request for an injunction against 
macmillans poisonpill defense which could have been used to 
dilute his stake in the company if he were to begin to accumulate 
macmillan stock 
the judge said he granted the request on condition that maxwell 
proceed with his offer 
among maxwells options are to appeal the decision to a higher 
court 
he had conditioned his tender offer on among other things the 
elimination of both the poison pill provision and the lockup 
option he had argued that if kohlberg were allowed to buy the four 
units macmillan would be left with a 250 million tax liability on 
the sale

program for its salaried workers is under review because it 
requires a ranking of nonunion employees that some workers feel is 
unfair a spokeswoman says 
patricia malloy said monday a decision on a compensation plan 
for salaried employees in 1989 has not been made but she said the 
company is reacting to changes in the program which resulted in 
some employee concern that judgments about their performance 
werent fair 
she said gm has used some form of a payforperformance plan for 
its salaried employees for years 
the problem with the modifications made last year was not so 
much that it distinguished among employees as much as the 
perception that some people were judged in their minds 
unfairly malloy said 
the rankings were created to determine how large a raise if 
any gms 114000 salaried employees should receive but workers 
who learned of the rankings began grumbling that such information 
should not be widely circulated

pillsbury cos board of directors urged 
stockholders today to reject grand metropolitan plcs unsolicited 
523 billion bid for the food and restaurant company 
the board described the 60ashare offer as inadequate 
pillsbury said its board instructed management to work with the 
companys financial and legal advisers to consider alternative 
courses that would boost the price of the companys stock and 
protect the best interests of the company and its shareholders 
the companys stock was unchanged at 5862 a share in midday 
trading on the new york stock exchange 
walter montgomery a spokesman for grand met said the british 
conglomerate had no immediate response to todays action by 
pillsbury board 
in a letter sent to all pillsbury shareholders philip l smith 
chairman and chief executive officer of pillsbury said the 
board believes that shareholders would realize greater value by 
retaining their stake in pillsbury 
now is not an appropriate time to sell the company remaining 
independent would be a superior alternative over the long term to 
accepting the grand met offer smith added 
at a news conference today smith said pillsburys options could 
include selling the company to a third party restructuring 
pillsburys finances by selling some businesses or going ahead with 
a leveraged buyout 
he said pillsbury will give shareholders a better idea of the 
companys strategy before the deadline for tendering stock to grand 
met expires 
the offer made by grand met 60 a share is not adequate 
smith said greater values are available to the shareholder in 
the long term 
asked what he thought pillsburys chances were in defending 
against a takeover bid by a wellheeled suitor smith said it 
aint over til its over 
wall street analysts had speculated monday that pillsbury would 
reject grand metropolitans offer which was made oct 4 and 
possibly announce a dividendyielding restructuring in an effort to 
remain independent or possibly attract a better offer from grand 
metropolitan 
there also was speculation that a european white knight 
possibly britains unilever plc might emerge as a friendly merger 
partner 
but smith said pillsbury was not currently up for sale and that 
remaining independent would be a superior alternative over the 
long term to accepting the grand met offer 
in his letter to shareholders smith said the board found 
that grand mets offer failed to reflect the values currently being 
developed at pillsbury and its subsidiaries under programs that are 
in the process of being implemented 
those programs include reinvesting in the companys core 
businesses he said 
pillsbury is a diversified international food company with 
operations in packaged consumer foods including green giant and 
haagen dazs products and restaurants 
among its restuarants are burger king steak and ale and 
bennigans 
the grand met bid is one of two takeover attempts in among 
giants in the food industry that are currently under way on 
monday philip morris cos announced a 11 billion bid for kraft 
inc that would make it the worlds largest maker of consumer 
goods like pillsbury kraft indicated it might fight the takeover

this midwestern city once recognized 
nationally for the swift emergence of health maintenance 
organizations is now at the center of an industrywide shakeout 
the merger of four tulsa health care plans within a few months 
represents a growing national trend of consolidation among hmos 
it sounds like a western but this towns not big enough for 
more plans said dr cb rebsamen of prucare of tulsa one of 
three surviving health maintenance plans left in a city that once 
offered more than 20 
i think whats happening in tulsa is an example of what the 
rest of the country is experiencing said rebsamen who is head 
of the doctor group for prucare we seem to be experiencing the 
end of the boost in the industry 
hmos which emerged earlier this decade as an alternative to 
traditional health insurance are prepaid plans of health services 
that include preventive treatment 
the plans buoyed by federal legislation requiring many 
employers to provide hmos as an option to employees offer health 
services through physician groups controlled by hmo units 
independent groups or private physicians who agree to participate 
industry observers say the large number of insolvencies and 
repeated annual losses for hmos are due to the rapid expansion in 
the industry rising benefit costs undercapitalization 
mismanagement and tough competition 
what theyre suffering most from is shortsightedness and 
stupidity said peter boland president of boland healthcare 
consultants in berkeley calif a national consulting firm for 
managed health plans 
as much as twothirds of all hmos nationally reported losses in 
1987 more than any other previous year boland said 
hmos have faced the added pressure of the evolution of preferred 
provider organizations or ppos another threeletter plan that in 
many cases offers customers more flexibility choice and 
accessibility than the traditional hmo boland said 
the combined effect of financial instability and viable 
competition in the market made initial early growth for hmos a 
shortlived phenomenon he said 
it really flew in the face of dynamics that are coming back to 
haunt them boland said 
bluelincs hmo in tulsa a blue cross and blue shield group 
acquired hmo of oklahoma health accord of oklahoma and aetna 
choice healthcare plan all within four months 
a unification of four hmos in less than 120 days is 
unprecedented in this industry said tom bowser executive vice 
president of bluelincs when announcing the last acquisition this 
past summer 
the tulsa mergers were not included in the most recent national 
quarterly report issued by interstudy a nonprofit research group 
based in excelsior minn that studies the health maintenance 
industry but the activity has not gone unnoticed said senior 
interstudy researcher judith hale 
theres certainly a trend toward consolidation nationally 
ms hale said youre either going to have to grow or youre going 
to have to go with a larger plan 
in 1985 tulsa began to be recognized by health care experts as 
an example of the growth and expansion of hmos across the country 
in that year 11 plans were offered in the city of 380000 
few medical markets outside california and minneapolis are as 
highly competitive and its doubtful any became so as fast 
wrote larry frederick senior associate editor of medical 
economics in the may 1985 issue of the national health industry 
magazine 
in 1985 there were 480 hmo plans nationwide with 21 million 
members the number of plans and participants had grown steadily 
since 1981 with the largest increase in plans and enrollment in 
1985 
we set up a situation where it was pretty easy to get into the 
hmo business ms hale said but its not very easy to stay in 
its a tough business 
hmos that succeed will have excellent management will be 
diversified and may or may not be legally constituted as hmos 
she states in a report on the future of the industry 
with the termination of physicians health plan of oklahoma only 
three plans remain in tulsa serving nearly 90000 clients 
nationally 15 health plans not including those merged in 
tulsa were terminated merged or acquired by another group in the 
first quarter of 1988 according to interstudy 
ms hale said national studies indicate a decrease in growth in 
the hmo industry with fewer new plans started and a drop in 
enrollment growth last year was the first year since 1981 that 
enrollment did not increase from the previous year and the first 
quarter of 1988 shows a decrease in the number of plans according 
to interstudys statistics 
as of march there were 648 hmos in the country serving 31 
million members an increase of 17 million clients since the 
previous quarter ms hale said the growth seemed to peak in june 
1987 with 662 plans serving just under 29 million members she said 
theres no question that the growth rate is slowing but its 
hardly a dying industry when you see 17 million new members she 
said what we see now is the number of new plans is balanced with 
the number of merged plans

bahrain is to have its first stock 
exchange by the end of the year and officials hope it will become 
the wall street of the oilrich gulf region 
initially 28 bahraini companies will be listed for trading 
with an aggregate capital of about 18 billion 
efforts are under way to attract business from neighboring arab 
countries as a new commercial confidence in the gulf emerges in the 
region with the ceasefire in the 8yearold iraniraq war 
the first stage will be limited to regulating and channeling 
existing share dealings mainly persontoperson in bahrain 
officials said the regulations are still being formulated but 
they noted that the financial records of all companies will be 
scrutinized and the exchanges board of directors will regularly 
review ceilings for share movements 
despite the lowkey beginning businessmen believe it wont be 
long before the small chamber at the end of manamas main banking 
street flourishes into a bustling bourse in a region that sits on 
onethird of the worlds oil reserves 
there is no fixed timetable for developing the exchange which 
officials hope will become the financial nerve center of the 
region bahraini gulf and international listings will be added 
over the next five to 10 years 
the man tapped to be its director general is banking on an even 
faster pace 
ten years is a long time we hope to have that status 
before then hopefully we can be recognized internationally before 
long said fawzi behzad adviser to the ninemember board 
he holds a doctorate from the international university of san 
diego calif earned in 1984 with a thesis entitled prototype 
for the bahrain stock market 
although the scale of gulf investment in the new exchange is not 
yet clear bahraini financier ali saleh cited some key advantages 
i believe the gulf is a prime region for investors no taxes 
no exchange problems he said 
behzad noted that the british governments order to kuwait to 
reduce its holdings in the british petroleum co was a timely 
reminder to gulf investors to look to their own region rather than 
abroad 
the scope for investment aboard is subject to the laws of 
those countries crises and annoyances on the world market are 
no doubt positive elements in enhancing chances of capital rushing 
back to the domestic market he said 
gulf states have invested billions of petrodollars harvested 
from the 1970s oil boom abroad strapped by the collapse of oil 
prices gulf governments want national stock exchanges and 
eventually a regional capital market to attract back billions of 
dollars held overseas by the private sector 
luring that money back may not be so easy considering the 
recent track record for equity markets in the region six years 
ago kuwaits unofficial souk almanakh stock market crashed under 
the weight of 94 billion of postdated paper checks many 
investors were badly hurt 
abdulnabi alshoala a leading businessman and member of the 
board of bahrains chamber of commerce said the kuwait crash was 
part of a chain reaction to the recession that has gripped the 
region since the iraniraq war broke out in september 1980 
the recession was fueled by a downturn in oil prices that began 
in 1982 the fluctuating dollar and a general stock market slump 
building peoples confidence isnt easy lots of people 
suffered through dealing in shares shoala said 
with dozens of offshore banks and financial institutions and 
traditionally the regions services center bahrain sees itself as 
the natural financial heart of the gulf 
kuwait recovering from almanakh is fast developing its infant 
official exchange oman plans a small market this year and the 
united arab emirates says its turn will come soon 
saudi arabia is cautiously fostering a dealings center and 
encouraging public issues by major firms 
bahrain is linked to saudi arabia kuwait qatar oman and the 
united arab emirates through the gulf cooperation council an 
economic and defense alliance 
economist henry azzam vice president of the gulf international 
bank has estimated that there is some 150 billion of gulf money 
invested abroad against 50 billion in the gcc 
the gulf investment authority owned by the gcc governments 
said in a recent study that a collective gcc stock market will 
polarize 320 billion in gcc petrodollars estimated to have been 
invested abroad 
during the oil boom when there was so much money around there 
was no need to mobilize liquidity but in the early 1980s 
governments started suffering shortages of capital and sought to 
beef up nonoil revenue 
financiers stressed the need to broaden bahrains capital market 
and to integrate with the gcc in theory gcc nationals can already 
buy up to 25 percent of shares in a gcc company elsewhere but some 
governments have acted to restrict that kuwait for example bans 
noncitizens holding stakes in its banks 
every gcc government has been talking about a larger role 
for the private sector if they want the savings in private hands 
they have to open channels for them said azzam

chevron co usa says it plans to drill 
an exploratory oil and gas well this winter from an ice island in 
the beaufort sea 
construction of the island and an ice road connecting it to 
shore is expected to begin in middecember a us army corps of 
engineers permit application said 
tom cook chevrons exploration manager said monday that 
drilling of the karluk prospect would be finished by may 1 to allow 
removal of all equipment before breakup 
the prospect is about eight miles east of the endicott oil field 
operated by the standard alaska production co it is inside the 
barrier islands on a state lease chevron acquired in 1979 in the 
joint statefederal beaufort sea lease sale 
chevron has been interested in the area for quite awhile cook 
said he said the company drilled a well on jeanette island about 
four mile north of the new prospect several years ago 
the well will be chevrons first since 1986 when it teamed with 
standard on the only well drilled to date in the coastal plain of 
the nearby arctic national wildlife refuge cook said there is no 
particular reason the company has planned the well for this winter 
other than that it is a prospect chevron identified some time ago 
state oil and gas officials said the 10year lease on the 
prospect is about to expire and speculated that might be chevrons 
primary reason for drilling this year 
the company is planning an ice island that is about 1000 feet 
in diameter and about 50 feet thick

jeffrey dudas began a stockbroker training program with 
prudentialbache securities inc on oct 19 1987 the day 
infamously recalled as black monday when the dow jones industrial 
average plummeted 508 points 
whats worse dudas began practicing his new profession on nov 
13 a friday 
foreboding signs and the hard reality of the crash aside dudas 
like some of the brokers who have made their debuts within the last 
year has used the crash to his advantage 
dudas 29 a former navy pilot said prospective clients were 
initially hesitant to commit to a new broker in the wake of the 
crash but were anxious to talk 
i have people who have had brokers for years and are dealing 
with me and one of the things they know is that their brokers 
didnt call them oct 19 or the weeks following said dudas who 
works at prudentialbaches office in virginia beach va 
a number of those brokers even some who did call their clients 
on the day of the crash might now be unemployed or in another line 
of work over 12000 workers in the securities business including 
brokers floor traders clerks and secretaries lost jobs as a 
result of the crash of a year ago according to some estimates 
a survey by the north american securities administrators 
administration a state regulatory agency shows approximately two 
out of three investors say their problems stemming from the crash 
have not been resolved john baldwin nasaas president said the 
survey indicated one out of seven small investors said they have 
left the market completely or were holding less than 500 in stocks 
once known for their ability to grab new customers with a daily 
round of cold calls young brokers joining the fold since the crash 
seem to be working harder than ever at getting to know their 
clients 
jim chin a broker for shearson lehmanhutton in new york since 
late 1987 said good brokering is not purely transactional 
youre not just calling a person and saying look i have 
this great stock you ought to buy it and you dont know anything 
about the person 
chin 42 meets with his clients a few times before deciding 
where to distribute their investments 
recently a client asked chin to invest his 1 million portfolio 
in equities realizing his expertise at that point was limited 
chin gave part of the responsibility and commission to other 
shearson money managers whose performance he monitors 
its not a matter of maxing out commissions but doing the 
right thing for the client chin said 
abbe spector a 25yearold financial consultant for merrill 
lynch amp co inc in new york compares the role of the postcrash 
broker to that of a physician 
you cant just walk into a doctors office and be prescribed a 
medicine spector said you have to get to know the history and 
then start making recommendations 
partly in response to the bottom falling out last year spector 
made the transition from municipal bond seller to fullservice 
broker 
during the bull market people were eager to hear a stock idea 
right off the bat spector said but since the crash people 
adjusted their thinking and want to talk about our overall ideas 
she said 
merrill lynch has taken the consultative approach for years 
according to spector but now the clients have come to expect it 
when spector is convinced that a person she has coldcalled is 
already under good financial care by another broker she usually 
does not try to pursue the business 
but many new brokers find that success is still based on a 
numbers game shearsons chin works a 55hour week and recently 
broke the 200 mark in his clientele 
new brokers are required to attain 40 new clients with 
investments of at least 10000 each in their first six months 
according to chin i blew it away chin said of the minimum 
the company sounds just as ambitious about the future of the 
brokering business spokesman michael oneill said shearson 
enrolled 900 in its training program for 1988 up slightly from 853 
in 1987 
we have a longterm commitment to retail investors even 
though individual investment is down this year he said 
for prudentialbaches dudas the challenge lies in holding on 
to new business 
nothing can compete with landing aboard a jet carrier at night 
the exaviator said reflectively but ive lost more sleep for my 
clients than i ever did after i came back from a bad landing in the 
navy

occidental petroleum co was ordered tuesday 
to sell tenneco polymers inc after an administrative law judge 
ruled that the 1986 acquisition of the company reduced competition 
in the production of materials needed to make plastics 
the ruling by judge thomas f howder upheld a 1986 complaint by 
the federal trade commission which had challenged occidentals 70 
million takeover of the polymer company 
the acquisition substantially reduced competition in the 
production of three types of polyvinyl chloride resin howder 
concluded 
the judge ordered occidental to divest tenneco polymers within

hercules inc on tuesday introduced a new 
filmpackaging technology that it claimed will double the shelf 
life of fresh produce 
hercules said its new freshhold package system controls the 
atmosphere inside packages thereby keeping produce fresh longer 
and preserving its appearance taste and color 
hercules a chemical and aerospace company based in wilmington 
del said it took five years to develop the packaging 
the key element is a breathable film that allows fresh produce 
to continue breathing after packing james e knox president of 
hercules engineered polymers co told a news conference this 
breathable film regulates the rate at which oxygen and carbon 
dioxide enter and leave the package 
an initial venture involving broccoli has been successful knox 
said 
freshhold packaging has been testmarketed at supermarkets in 
richmond va baltimore chicago los angeles minneapolis and 
dallas 
cauliflower strawberries celery carrots lettuce and 
pineapple will be available with the new packaging next year the 
company said 
while packaged produce now makes up only 3 percent of the 
billiondollar us produce market many companies are working on 
similar concepts to extend shelf life experts say the new product 
also will reduce the amount of ice needed to transport produce 
across the country 
the freshhold packaging also has some drawbacks according to 
experts the lunglike membrane on top of the film has to be custom 
designed to the respiration rate of each type of produce held in 
the box and it requires good refrigeration for optimum performance 
in addition consumers must be convinced that precut fruits and 
vegetables are as fresh as those they can choose themselves from 
the produce bin the experts say the produce packaged in freshhold 
sells for slightly more than unpackaged fruits and vegetables

maurice allais a prolific theorist 
whose ideas on balancing supply and demand helped rebuild the 
french economy after world war ii won the nobel prize for 
economics tuesday 
allais a paris shopkeepers son became mentor to a generation 
of economists he developed formulas to enable large enterprises 
particularly public ones to keep an economy in balance by 
regulating prices and allocating their resources 
after the award was announced the 77yearold economist said he 
had given up hope of ever winning the prize which was established 
20 years ago ive been mentioned so many times before i just 
didnt think i would get it he said at from apartment in a paris 
suburb 
the poverty and unemployment allais saw in the united states on 
a visit during the great depression of the 1930s turned him to 
economics from the engineering career for which he had trained 
he is a giant in economic theoretic analysis said assar 
lindbeck who heads the committee of the royal swedish academy of 
sciences that awards the nobel memorial prize in economic science 
hes been under consideration for a long time lindbeck 
said it took a long time to investigate him because of the great 
volume and complexity of his works 
according to the citation allais was honored for his 
pioneering contributions to the theory of markets and efficient 
utilization of resources 
this years prizes are worth about 390000 allais is the first 
french national to win the economics award according to the 
official list but 1983 laureate gerard debreu of the united states 
was born in calais he was a student of allais 
allais did his major work in nazioccupied france during the 
war he published in search of an economic discipline in 1943 
and economy and interest in 1947 
of his change in careers the laureate said tuesday my 
motivation when i was young was an idea of being able to improve 
the conditions of life to try to find a remedy to many of the 
problems facing the world thats what led me into economics i saw 
it as a way of helping people 
jacques levy director of the ecole nationale de mines said 
he was the mentor for everyone involved in the economy in postwar 
france between 1945 and 1968 all the people who were in charge of 
the biggest enterprises and of the state planning apparatus 
allais taught at levys institution until his retirement nine 
years ago and is not widely known outside france he has continued 
research and writing 
his theories are expressed in complicated mathematical formulas 
they form the basis for sorting out the thousands of independent 
factors involved in marketing goods and services how much should a 
train ticket cost for example or what is the right price for a 
kilowatthour of electricity 
levy said the idea is to keep supply and demand in balance and 
according to the allais theories its the governments role to 
organize this fair competition 
the academy said the french economists work in some ways 
parallels that of earlier nobel laureates paul samuelson of the 
united states and sir john hicks of britain 
allais says he is not from any mold 
if you will permit me i dont fit into any category except my 
own he declared tuesday i am not a monetarist and i am not a 
keynesian on certain points i agree with each 
samuelson was once quoted as saying a generation of economic 
theory would have taken a different course if allais earliest 
writings had been in english 
americans have dominated the prize fifteen americans are among 
the 25 economics laureates and five are british 
allais has published constantly since the war and has at least 
36 titles to his credit including works on history and physics he 
is an officer of frances legion of honor 
in 1959 he experimented with a pendulum of his own invention 
conducting 220000 tests to demonstrate that earths gravity is 
neither constant nor always oriented in the same direction 
he has a vitality which seems to continue all his life said 
tord ganelius secretarygeneral of the economics prize committee 
un peacekeeping forces won the nobel peace prize announced 
sept 29 in oslo norway and the award in literature went to 
egyptian novelist naguib mahfouz the first arabiclanguage writer 
to win it 
on monday american researchers gertrude b elion and george h 
hitchings shared the medicine award with sir james w black of 
britain for helping develop drugs for use against leukemia high 
blood pressure aids and other diseases 
prize winners in chemistry and physics prizes will be announced 
wednesday 
economics is the only one of the six nobel prizes not stipulated 
in the will of swedish industrialist alfred nobel the inventor of 
dynamite who died in 1896 
it was established by the bank of sweden and first awarded in 
1969 the other prizes have been given since 1901

grain and soybean futures closed mostly lower 
tuesday on the chicago board of trade reflecting the weak tone of 
the grain export business 
soybeans swung in a range from 804 to 816 a bushel the 
market opened higher in response to the wet weather that has slowed 
corn and soybean harvesting in the midwest then sold off on the 
lack of strong overseas demand for us soybeans said cathy leow 
a grainmarket analyst with thomson mckinnon securities inc in new 
york 
corn finished mostly lower while wheat was down moderately on 
liquidation linked to the continuing disappointment over the lack 
of a new longterm soviet agreement to buy grain from the united 
states ms leow said 
it does not look like were going to get an agreement prior to 
the presidential election she said 
at the close wheat was 1 cent to 7 cents lower with the 
contract for delivery in december at 422 a bushel corn was 3 
cents lower to 1 cents higher with december at 292 a bushel

telephone amp telegraph co raised the stakes tuesday in a battle 
with other computer giants over control of unix a base layer of 
software that makes it easier for different brands of computers to 
work together 
by banding together the big computer makers gained more 
bargaining power in the contest with the open software foundation 
a group that includes international business machines corp 
digital equipment corp and hewlettpackard co 
unix is portrayed by enthusiasts as a great hope of the computer 
industry because it would allow programs to run on a wide variety 
of computers without expensive alteration 
however the struggle over unix has soured computer buyers who 
fear the standard is being split in two programs written to work 
with one version of unix might not run on computers that use 
another version 
both sides in the contest say they want to unify unix but the 
atampt group insists that atampts unix system v release 40 should 
serve as the basis while the open software foundation says ibms 
version aix should be the core 
the atampt alliance scored a small victory when the open software 
foundation indicated tuesday that there might be room for 
compromise until now it has made its insistence on ibms aix a 
nonnegotiable point 
nothing has changed on that right now open software 
foundation spokesman gary mccormack said but that doesnt mean 
the world cant change tomorrow please bear with us 
a meeting between atampt and the open software foundation was 
scheduled for later in the week probably friday mccormack said 
the new group rallying around atampts version of unix is made up 
of 18 companies including giants such as unisys corp ncr corp 
japans fujitsu ltd and italys ing c olivetti amp co spa 
the open software foundation was created earlier this year 
because of concerns that atampt was manipulating unix so it would be 
best suited to run on its own computers and those of its 
fastgrowing silicon valley partner sun microsystems inc 
but supporters of atampts version of unix known as system v 
release 40 say atampt has taken steps to ensure that other 
companies and customers have a big say in the development of unix 
what atampt has done is resolve those issues jan lindelow 
senior vice president for marketing and services at unisys said in 
an interview 
among the other companies that have joined the new group are 
amdahl corp control data corp gould inc intel corp motorola 
inc italys ing c olivetti amp co spa prime computer inc and 
japans toshiba corp 
intel and two smaller companies are members of both groups we 
dont play favorites said kevin teixeira an intel spokesman

eastern airlines labor officials said tuesday they 
are hopeful there will be other suitors for the carrier from which 
financier carl icahn has reportedly backed away 
well just keep moving along said charles e bryan 
president of the machinists district 100 said before leaving 
tuesday for outoftown meetings concerning eastern were 
confident that we will still get something worked out 
icahn the chairman of trans world airlines inc said in an 
interview with the wall street journal that the talks are over 
its unfortunate because a merger with eastern would have been 
very positive for twa but what will be will be icahn was quoted 
in tuesdays editions 
icahn reportedly notified frank lorenzo the chairman of 
easterns parent texas air corp on monday that he was unable to 
reach an understanding with easterns three unions over the weekend 
but with eastern continuing to lose money and lorenzo stalemated 
in efforts to extract concessions from its unions wall street 
analysts and eastern labor officials think he wants to sell 
i dont think theres any question that his advisers and 
lenders have advised him that his crusade against labor is going to 
drag the whole texas air corp down the tubes said ron cole a 
spokesman for easterns air line pilots association local i 
think he has realized the only way out is to sell 
however the miami herald quoting an unidentified source said 
tuesday there were no other active offers for eastern and that 
lorenzo is planning to keep the airline 
icahn had been negotiating for more than a week with lorenzo and 
easterns pilot and machinist unions although icahn never made a 
specific acquisition proposal last wednesday new york developer 
donald trump agreed to buy the eastern shuttle for 365 million in 
cash 
sources told the associated press on monday that the union talks 
broke down mainly because icahn was seeking wage concessions from 
the eastern unions that the union leaders considered too severe 
icahn got too greedy one union source told the journal 
the newspaper also reported that icahn negotiators became angry 
when twas machinists union tried to tie its forthcoming contract 
negoiations with the talks with eastern 
lorenzo reportedly had given icahn an exclusive right until the 
end of the week to make an offer for eastern to the texas air board 
of directors after that deadline other interested parties could 
come forward with offers 
texas air executives have indicated that moneylosing eastern 
minus its northeast shuttle would be worth about 1 billion 
according to the new york times 
in addition to icahn other parties that have expressed an 
interest in buying the rest of eastern include twa president joseph 
corr who is a close associate of icahn and a group of major 
insurance companies the times said 
eastern has racked up losses of more than 3025 million since 
1987 
meanwhile eastern announced on monday an unusual peakseason 
cut in maxsaver fares between florida and northeast cities 
never before has eastern offered such deep discounts so far 
ahead of the peak winter travel season said george brennan 
easterns newly named vice president for marketing 
fares will range from 69 one way to 89 depending on 
destination fares between florida and new york for example are 
79 each way thats 33 percent off the normal restricted maxsavers 
fares and 70 percent or more off regular coach prices 
roundtrip tickets must be purchased 24 hours after a reservation 
is made and are nonrefundable they must be bought by oct 31 for 
trips beginning nov 1 through feb 15 a saturday night stayover 
is required 
the new rates announced monday involve 16 florida cities and 
40 northern destinations 
the rates through the winter season a peak travel time to 
florida from the northeast exempts nov 23 27 and 28 dec 22 
and 23 and jan 2 and 3 from the cutrate fares

an agreement between illinois and a british 
agency to share securities information is the first of its kind 
between a us state and a foreign regulatory body a state 
association said tuesday 
illinois agreement with the british underscores the vital 
role that the states can play in policing our increasingly 
interconnected securities markets said john c baldwin 
president of the north american securities administrators 
association 
much of the securities enforcement in the us is carried out 
at the state level he said so it makes good sense that state 
securities agencies should play a crucial role in the oversight of 
global securities markets 
the accord was signed oct 12 by illinois secretary of state jim 
edgar and robert p wilkinson director of enforcement for the 
securities association in great britain the largest stock market 
selfregulatory organization operating under the united kingdoms 
financial services act 
however the pact was not announced until the national 
organization representing 50 state securities agencies received a 
firm indication that tsas board would approve it at their next 
meeting nov 7 said scott staff a spokesman for the us group 
it is similar to an agreement between tsa and the american stock 
exchange and to ones reached recently between the us securities 
and exchange commission and canadian provinces and territories the 
nasaa said 
under the accord the illinois securities department and british 
association will exchange information on securities transactions 
from their respective files for enforcement and regulatory purposes 
this agreement further establishes chicago and illinois as a 
world financial leader said edgar who oversees the activities 
of the states securities department the securities market today 
is global in character so regulation and enforcement should be 
global as well

the stock market finished higher today in 
moderate trading rallying briskly after seesawing gently through 
much of the trading session 
most of the action centered around the issues of several big 
food companies that are involved in takeover activity 
the rest of the market is still on hold said hildegarde 
zagorski an analyst for prudentialbache securities inc 
market watchers said the subdued tone was largely due to 
underlying uneasiness in advance of wednesdays oneyear 
anniversary of the october stock market collapse 
on the eve of the anniversary of the debacle it was another 
fairly slow day on the new york stock exchange and brokers said 
they had lots of time on their hands 
kraft stock shot up in heavy trading in response to the 90 a 
share offered late monday by philip morris in an 11 billion 
takeover offer philip morris stock dropped apparently because 
investors felt the acquisition would dilute the earnings of the 
cigarette and food giant 
philip morris said it has filed suit against kraft and some of 
its directors in an illinois court 
in another major development in the food industry pillsbury 
said its board of directors unanimously rejected a 60ashare 
tender offer from grand metropolitan of britain 
pillsbury later disclosed that it had filed a suit against grand 
met and wendell investments ltd for violations of the shipping act 
of 1916

a year ago wednesday the world seemed to be 
collapsing around earl e ellis as he battled and screamed to keep 
order in three tumbling stocks 
it was a very scary time said ellis a market maker on the 
floor of the new york stock exchange where prices collapsed in 
frenzied selling on oct 19 1987 put some of his colleagues out 
of business and severely stretched the limits of others there 
was disbelief and certainly fear 
he spent that night in a nearby hotel rather than returning to 
his suburban long island home wife and teenage daughter what 
really worried him he said was what would happen on oct 20 
logic said it wasnt going to happen again he said 
emotion said it was 
in an interview on the eve of the anniversary of the worst stock 
panic of modern times ellis said the anxiety level has fallen 
sharply but so has interest in stocks like other nyse market 
makers known as specialists ellis is now more concerned with 
the absence of buyers and sellers his bread and butter 
ours is a business of feast or famine always has been always 
will be the 47yearold said in his native dallas drawl as he 
leaned against his trading post on the cavernous nyse floor in 
lower manhattans jungle of skyscrapers its certainly closer to 
famine now 
a partner in the specialist firm benjamin jacobson amp sons ellis 
has been in the business for more than a decade during a typical 
day he buys and sells thousands of shares in anheuserbusch 
tandem computers and the student loan marketing association known 
on wall street as sallie mae 
as a specialist his firm has what amounts to a franchise in 
these and 37 other stocks on the nyse floor acting as an 
intermediary for buy and sell orders from brokers stationed along 
the floor perimeters 
in return the specialist firm is obligated to set opening 
prices and keep trading orderly largely by selling from its own 
inventory when other sellers are scarce and buying when buyers are 
scarce 
on black monday oct 19 and its volatile aftermath a 
marauding avalanche of sellers threatened to overwhelm the ability 
of the nyses 54 specialist firms to do their jobs 
many were reluctant to buy stocks because they were uncertain 
whether other buyers would appear others who had spent enormous 
amounts of borrowed money to buy stocks faced credit crises with 
their banks 
elliss firm one of wall streets strongest traded more than 
1 billion in securities during the week of the crash 
the performance of the specialists was criticized in some 
postcrash studies which called them a weakness in a system that 
experienced unprecedented strain 
but ellis defended what he called the fairest and most efficient 
market system even in the face of new technologies that have 
replaced many of the trading functions once performed by humans 
if you ask how the specialists did on black monday youd get 
a different answer from every one ellis said some went out of 
business some made bad mistakes but one has to understand what a 
specialist does 
we are a pricing mechanism were not here to buy every stock 
for sale he said what were here to do is make sure its done 
in an an orderly fashion we could have done everything right and 
the market could still have come down 
computers can speed the delivery of buy and sell orders to the 
trading floor he said but the auction process the bargaining and 
haggling that inevitably becomes part of securities trading will 
always be a human domain 
you cant automate the interface of brokers he contended 
you cant black box that 
on the day before the anniversary the nyse floor was relatively 
quiet and few people were talking about the crash its 
history said james e garlinge an ellis colleague who trades 
usg corp stock 
in the first hour ellis traded a few thousand shares of 
anheuserbusch with floor brokers and the price moved up point 
or 62 cents a share to 3350 a bluecoated nyse reporter who 
conveys all trades into a computer system that feeds the exchanges 
electronic ticker tape dutifully recorded the transactions this 
is slow ellis said 
the biggest action was a few trading posts away at stokes hoyt 
amp co the specialist firm for kraft co where brokers were 
screaming to sell because the stock was up nearly 30 a share on a 
90ashare takeover offer by philip morris cos inc 
several specialists watching from afar shook their heads in 
dismay to them takeovers are bad news because the acquired 
companys stock will no longer be traded 
its a product that we lose said james a jacobson another 
partner in the jacobson firm its very tough to lose a company

cigar and pipe tobacco manufacturers in 
california have decided to put cancer warnings on their products 
rather than fight a lawsuit that could have resulted in thousands 
of dollars in fines 
the manufacturers already were losing money in sales because a 
chain of stores refused to stock their products and others 
threatened to follow suit 
the lawsuit was filed and some products removed after the 
manufacturers failed to comply with proposition 65 a toxins 
initiative passed by california voters in 1986 
the initiative requires businesses to provide clear and 
reasonable warnings to consumers exposed to chemicals known to 
cause cancer or birth defects 
the tobacco manufacturers were very eager to settle and do the 
right thing said duane peterson a spokesman for state attorney 
general john van de kamp 
the manufacturers made the decision monday but on tuesday 
cigars and pipe tobacco were still absent from the shelves of vons 
supermarkets the 345market statewide chain that became the first 
supermarket company to announce it would pull the products from it 
shelves 
the shelves are still empty vons has not seen a copy of the 
agreement said spokeswoman vickie sanders she said the grocery 
company would withhold comment on the agreement until it had been 
reviewed 
under the settlement companies will begin placing warning 
labels on cigars and pipe tobacco the state has agreed to waive 
the fines of 2500 a day it had threatened to place on every pack 
of cigars or other tobacco products that did not contain such 
warnings 
since passage of proposition 65 there have been several court 
fights over which substances should be classified as toxic 
cigarettes chewing tobacco and snuff all carry federally mandated 
warnings 
we want to make it clear that we have been in compliance with 
federal warning laws for a year and a half we are not part of the 
lawsuit said chris close a spokesman for the smokeless tobacco 
institute in washington 
the institute represents makers of snuff and chewing tobacco 
close said the state health and welfare agency said in a july 1 
letter that the warnings on snuff and chewing tobacco are 
consistent with the spirit and intended effect of proposition 65 
although labeling is burdensome the manufacturers preferred 
to avoid lengthy and costly litigation norman sharp president 
of the washingtonbased cigar association said in a statement 
most cigar products sold nationally will bear the california 
warning because it would be impossible to label only those sold in 
california sharp said 
the lawsuit filed sept 30 prompted at least eight retailers 
and 25 tobacco companies to agree to the warnings 
van de kamp filed the lawsuit about two months after 
environmental groups said they would seek 13 billion in fines 
from stores and manufacturers for violating the proposition 65 
warning requirement 
after vons announcement of oct 4 lucky stores with 343 
markets across the state followed by giving tobacco makers 30 days 
to label their products or have them removed from luckys stores 
safeway stores inc which operates 221 stores in california 
has posted its own warning signs near cigar pipe and chewing 
tobacco displays the company also told tobacco manufacturers that 
it would no longer accept shipments of products without labels 
after monday

the fivemonthold takeover fight for macmillan 
inc was put on hold tuesday for at least two weeks as a result of 
court action in delaware 
the delaware supreme court agreed to hear british publisher 
robert maxwells appeal of a lower court ruling relating to 
macmillans merger agreement with a rival suitor and set oral 
arguments for nov 2 
the publishing giant has agreed to be acquired in a leveraged 
buyout for 25 billion by a group led by the investment firm 
kohlberg kravis roberts amp co and including macmillan senior 
management 
maxwell has offered 251 billion for macmillan under certain 
conditions through his maxwell communication corp 
earlier in the day the delaware chancery court issued a 
preliminary injunction preventing the kohlberg group from 
completing its tender offer for macmillans stock until maxwell 
could appeal that order will apparently remain in effect until 
after the supreme court issues a decision in the case 
nothing can happen until november neither side can change 
their offer the status quo is maintained said macmillan 
spokesman david jackson 
it doesnt come as a surprise said a top maxwell financial 
adviser robert s pirie this is a major case under delaware law 
and i would have been surprised if the supreme court hadnt agreed 
to hear it 
the court action in wilmington del came a day after judge 
jack jacobs refused to grant a preliminary injunction requested by 
maxwell against a lockup provision that macmillan granted 
kohlberg 
the provision would give kohlberg the right to buy four of 
macmillans businesses for about 865 million if its merger 
agreement fell through 
under the merger pact kohlberg agreed to pay 9005 a share in 
cash and securities for macmillans stock 
maxwell who is determined to make his company one of the 
worlds biggest communications concerns has offered 9025 in cash 
for each of macmillans 278 million shares provided that among 
other things the lockup provision is eliminated 
maxwell contends the lockup provision is unfair and would leave 
the company with a 250 million tax liability 
he has said he would drop his tender offer if he were allowed to 
buy the same four businesses for 900 million they include the 
berlitz language centers the directory division the direct 
marketing division and a division that publishes state legal codes 
the fight for macmillan has been underway since midmay when a 
group led by the wealthy texan robert m bass proposed acquiring 
the company for 64 a share the bass group has since dropped out 
of the bidding 
in trading on the new york stock exchange macmillan fell 50 
cents a share to 8825

small business growth has remained healthy after 
the stock market crash a year ago with sales and employment gains 
outpacing those of larger corporations according to an economic 
index reported tuesday 
american express co said its small business growth index rose 
sharply in the first half of 1988 to 446 from 148 for the 
previous six months 
the strongest gains were in the midatlantic states of new york 
new jersey and pennsylvania which recovered quickly from the oct 
19 stock market plunge which occured a year ago wednesday 
the dramatic increase in the growth index reflects an 
overall resiliency within the small business sector said david 
birch a professor at massachusetts institute of technology who is 
cochairman of the american express small business partnership 
the index measures the semiannual growth in employment sales 
and new incorporations of some 7 million small companies defined 
as those with 100 or fewer employees 
the index found that small business employment rose 197 percent 
and sales grew 13 percent in the first half of this year compared 
with a 190 percent jobs gain and 106 percent sales rise in the 
second half of 1987 new incorporations remained steady 
while small business sales and employment growth outpaced 
similar rates for large business the gap between the two narrowed 
in the first six months of this year the report said 
in the last half of 1987 small business sales grew at a rate 
82 times those of large business but in the first half of 1988 
the rate narrowed to 37 times the report said 
large business cutbacks prevalent throughout the 1980s 
appear to have bottomed out said birch additionally large 
business employment is now accelerating and sales growth almost 
nonexistent last year is beginning to rise to the level of 
highperforming small business 
the weakest growth area for small business was in the mountain 
states region where sales dropped 235 percent and employment 
edged up 131 percent this was the only area showing a negative 
indicator the report said 
the biggest turnaround came in the region that includes 
kentucky tennessee alabama and mississippi where overall sales 
employment and new incorporations grew 103 percent after a 394 
drop the previous six months 
new england ranked first for employment growth at 233 percent 
while the pacific states led in sales growth with a rise of 272 
percent the report said

after serving two years as president of troubled 
burger king charles s olcott resigned tuesday in the fastfood 
companys second top management shakeup this year 
the resignation comes as burger kings parent minneapolisbased 
pillsbury co is scrambling to defend itself against an unwanted 
takeover bid 
analysts said it was olcotts failure to reverse burger kings 
losing trend that led to his departure under olcott burger king 
embarked on an expensive and ultimately disappointing marketing 
campaign based on the slogan we do it like youd do it 
william maguire an analyst at merrill lynch amp co in new york 
said olcott wasnt a marketing man when they needed a marketing 
man badly 
pillsbury is in the process of defending itself against an 
unsolicited 523 billion tender offer launched by londonbased 
grand metropolitan plc 
analysts speculated that pillsbury might opt to sell burger 
king the worlds secondlargest hamburger chain in an effort to 
preserve its independence a sale could bring as much as 2 billion 
pillsburys board unanimously rejected grand mets 60ashare 
offer tuesday calling it inadequate and not in the best 
interests of the company and its shareholders 
theyre fighting the only battle they can said john 
mcmillin an analyst with prudentialbache securities inc in new 
york 
the hamburger chain accounts for about onethird of pillsburys 
sales and about twothirds of its profits but has not done well 
recently its pretax profits have decline by more than 50 percent 
from 1192 million in fiscal 1986 to 482 million for the year 
ended may 31 the company reported 
pillsbury chairman philip l smith said tuesday in urging 
shareholders to reject grand mets bid that significant investments 
have been made to improve burger king operations he said improved 
performance is critical to the chain 
olcotts departure marks yet another major management shakeup 
for the fastfood chain which has had five chairman and eight 
presidents since pillsbury took over in 1967 
most recently j jeffery campbell resigned as head of 
pillsburys ailing restaurant group in june 
jerry w levin a pillsbury executive vice president was named 
burger kings chairman he had worked previously in mergers and 
acquisitions at pillsbury prompting financial analysts to 
speculate pillsbury might be preparing to get rid of the 
miamibased restaurant chain 
the guys good at doing deals mcmillin said ive got to 
think hes been brought in to do a deal
