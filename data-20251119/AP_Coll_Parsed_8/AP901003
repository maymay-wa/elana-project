an outbreak of foodpoisoning apparently 
salmonella sent 85 more conventioneers to hospitals wednesday 
just two days after more than 200 people became sick from the same 
outbreak authorities said 
at least two people were in intensive care but a hospital 
spokeswoman said their lives were not in danger 
it would certainly seem to be a salmonella problem even 
though we dont have confirmation numbers anywhere near complaint 
numbers said mike mccarthy a spokesman for the chicago health 
department 
most of those stricken by food poisoning were conventioneers 
attending the annual meeting of true value hardware stores 
at grant hospital where 70 patients were examined wednesday 
preliminary results of laboratory tests had determined 10 patients 
admitted earlier this week were suffering from salmonella said 
ginny sharp a hospital spokeswoman 
other hospitals also probably had reached similar findings but 
hadnt yet notified the department mccarthy said 
at this particular time we have not determined what substance 
may have been the agent added mccarthy 
ms sharp said the two patients in intensive care were there 
because they have some previous condition that made their 
situation worse 
she said the hospital was describing their condition as fair to 
serious which means some vital signs are not stable 
mccarthy said the primary target of the departments 
investigation was a buffet dinner the conventioneers ate sunday 
night at the hyatt regencychicago he said authorities also were 
checking into a meal served monday at the headquarters of true 
values parent company cotter amp co 
ambulances were dispatched to the hyatt regency and the swiss 
grand hotels wednesday to take the latest victims to the hospitals 
said fire department spokesman mike cosgrove 
the midamerica chapter of the american red cross said 85 people 
were taken to hospitals wednesday spokeswoman randi killian said 
she did not know how many of those were admitted to hospitals nor 
did she know their conditions 
mccarthy said the people who became sick monday and wednesday 
were suffering from the same foodpoisoning incident not a second 
one 
these people either had original symptoms that declined and 
then flared up again or they did not go for examination or 
treatment originally he said 
symptoms of the salmonella bacteria include nausea vomiting 
diarrhea and fever patients must take care to avoid dehydration 
mccarthy said 
because salmonella has 1400 strains hospitals will forward 
test results to the states public health laboratory which will 
classify the strain he said 
tim hadac another chicago health department spokesman said the 
hyatt regency kitchen was inspected came up clean and was 
allowed to stay open 
food served at the hyatt regencys sunday dinner included 
lettuce with a creamstyle dressing deviled eggs with salami 
chicken stuffed with wild rice and spinach mixed vegetables and 
bread pudding with cream sauce 
at this point we dont have any reason to believe its 
hyatt nancy ruth a spokeswoman for the hotel said wednesday 
still she said the hotel was taking some voluntary 
precautions food handlers who worked the function sunday have 
been furloughed with pay until their test results come in 
she said the hotel also was having its kitchen staff checked for 
any foodborne viruses 
we also have a staff microbiologist who is monitoring the 
kitchen and the foodpreparation procedures to be sure that the 
standards of the illinois department of health are either met or 
exceeded she said

an intestinal operation to lower the cholesterol 
of heart attack patients reduced their risk for another heart 
attack or death from heart disease researchers said today 
the surgery called a partial ileal bypass has one significant 
drawback it causes chronic diarrhea that persists for years 
in the operation doctors change the route of the small 
intestine so about onethird of it is bypassed this reduces the 
amount of cholesterol that is absorbed into the bloodstream 
the 52 million 17year study was conducted on people who had 
already suffered heart attacks the approach lengthened the lives 
of people who had very mild heart attacks but not those with more 
severe heart damage 
during an average of 10 years of follow up the death rate among 
surgery patients who had sustained minimal heart damage was 24 
percent in a comparison group without the intestinal surgery it 
was 39 percent 
dr henry buchwald of the university of minnesota who directed 
the study said the surgery should be considered along with 
cholesterollowering drugs as a possible standard treatment 
it has a role in the management of patients with high 
cholesterol who have had a heart attack buchwald said it is 
eminently logical to extend all cholesterollowering therapy 
including this to patients with high cholesterol who have not had 
a heart attack 
besides diarrhea those who undergo the surgery are somewhat 
more prone to have kidney stones gallstones and intestinal 
obstructions 
the study was conducted in minneapolis los angeles 
philadelphia and little rock ark and published in todays new 
england journal of medicine 
despite wide acceptance of cholesterol lowering doubts remain 
about whether it actually helps people live longer if they already 
have healthy hearts although the latest study was conducted 
exclusively on people who had suffered heart attacks buchwald said 
he believes the research should settle that question 
it offers the strongest justification for marked lipid 
cholesterol ineervention that has ever been offered buchwald 
said it is a very powerful study and should except for certain 
people who will never be satisfied end the cholesterol 
controversy 
in the study 421 people who recovered from heart attacks 
underwent the surgery while a comparison group of 417 people were 
treated with diet alone at the start of the study their average 
cholesterol levels were 251 the surgery lowered peoples 
cholesterol 23 percent 
the overall risk of dying from heart disease or suffering 
another nonfatal heart attack was reduced 35 percent among the 
surgical patients with the healthiest hearts the surgical patients 
also required less than half as many coronary bypass operations 
because of clogged heart arteries

baseball historians were thrown a curve 
wednesday with a newspaper report that alexander cartwright 
possibly wasnt the inventor of their game 
the new york times said that a newly discovered newspaper report 
and box score show that other teams were already playing baseball 
in new york city a year earlier than when cartwright supposedly 
invented the game in 1846 
the story also reported that baseball probably evolved from a 
number of enthusiasts in new york in the mid1840s rather than 
springing fully formed from the imagination of anyone in 
particular 
according to the times which published the story in its 
thursday editions the discovery was made by edward l widmer a 
harvard graduate student who was doing research for his doctoral 
dissertation at the new york historical society 
in a copy of the new york morning news widmer reportedly found 
an account of a game on oct 21 1845 between the new york ball 
club and a team from brooklyn like the 1846 game credited by 
historians as the first the earlier game was played at the elysian 
fields in hoboken nj then a bucolic area easily reachable from 
manhattan by ferry 
the morning news said that new york won 244 aided by a grand 
slam or in the vocabulary of the time four aces off a single 
hit 
at the conclusion of the match both parties sat down to a 
dinner the newspaper reported reflecting baseballs origins 
as a social event between gentlemen 
the account of the oct 21 1845 game in the new york morning 
news indicates that the popularity of baseball was spreading 
rapidly at the time two more base clubs are already formed in 
our sister city brooklyn the story related 
the morning news did not say which rules were used an important 
question to specialists 
in popular myth baseball was invented in cooperstown by abner 
doubleday historians seeking the true progenitor have instead 
credited cartwright a new york bank clerk who is said to have 
drawn up the rules and organized the first game in 1846 for the 
knickerbocker base ball club at the elysian fields

israeli soldiers are drawn as dogs and jewish 
settlers as rats toting rifles as for the arabs theyre depicted 
as having sinister mustaches and jagged scars across their cheeks 
the drawings are not the work of political cartoonists on one 
side or other in the arabisraeli conflict they are illustrations 
for childrens books meant to entertain and teach palestinian or 
israeli youngsters 
professor adir cohen author of a study of hebrew childrens 
literature called an ugly face in the mirror says such books 
give birth to lifelong hatreds among israelis and palestinians 
we learned from freud how stories and fairytales enter our 
subconscious it infiltrates to those places of the 
subconscious and comes up repeatedly said cohen head of the 
education department at haifa university 
he described arabs in hebrew childrens books as having a huge 
terrible mustache and scary eyes the nose of an eagle a scar 
and a narrow forehead 
we are talking about processes of dehumanization that are 
connected to the arabisraeli struggle connected to defense and 
wars he said it is much easier to fight a roach 
cohen used as an example the typical detective stories for young 
boys who in a few years will be soldiers in which the israeli 
hero battles arab murderers bandits or terrorists 
in avner carmielis the young detectives settle in the wild 
negev a young hero overcomes hundreds of arabs among them 
kings he lines up his prisoners and strides up and down shouting 
left left faster gamal abdul nasser straighten your 
backs hussein and faisel look front nuri asaid 
the book goes on to explain how the kings and dictators and 
leaders marched forward quickly under his orders the names used 
are typically arab but gamal abdul nasser was also the late 
egyptian president who was one of israels chief enemies 
many of the hebrew books with such messages are aimed at boys in 
their preteens similar arab literature is intended for even 
younger readers who in other societies might be reading about fairy 
princesses 
in nasser abed alaltifs the flower beauty queen jewish 
settlers in the occupied west bank are pictured as rats wielding 
rifles former prime minister menachem begin curls his dragon claws 
over an arab village in hamdan yusefs the sad times of deir 
yassin 
khawla abu bakr author of a study called the political 
socialization of palestinian children by means of arab childrens 
literature says west bank childrens books have as many 
stereotypes as israeli works 
the israeli soldier is always depicted as a wolf a chicken 
an elephant dogs she said human figures are always seen as 
bureaucrats inconsiderate officials police who break arms or 
cruel soldiers 
abu bakr an arab israeli from the jewisharab seaside town of 
akko defended the stereotypes of israeli soldiers as a reflection 
of the arab childrens daily life 
for example she said a story by rawdeh alhodhod called the 
secret of the red devils in el bire tells of arab boys on a trip 
who are arrested after one of them throws a stone at an army jeep 
youngsters often have been at the forefront of the palestinian 
uprising that began in december 1987 thousands of youngsters have 
been arrested and 158 palestinian children aged 16 and under have 
died of israeli army or civilian gunfire 
palestinian childrens books also make references to the real 
world the deir yassin mentioned in hamdan yusefs book was an arab 
village where more than 200 palestinian men women and children 
were massacred by jewish militiamen in 1948 
another feature of the arab childrens books is a clearly stated 
moral the story of the arrested boys concludes our enemy is not 
the boy but the soldier the boy is a hero and did nothing 
wrong to be punished for you have to suffer and be a man 
cohen agreed that the intefadeh or palestinian uprising 
enforces the message in the palestinian books but he noted many 
were published before the revolt no doubt had we known how to 
read this literature correctly years ago we would have seen how 
they were preparing for the intefadeh he said 
for his study cohen examined more than 500 hebrew works and 
interviewed hundreds of jewish children to determine the influence 
of the books abu bakr studied 300 books written in israel the 
west bank jordan lebanon and egypt 
cohen said he hoped a new stream of israeli childrens 
literature stressing coexistence would gain in readership but he 
added that adventure stories featuring israeli heroes and wicked 
arabs remain more popular 
abu bakr said stories without stereotypes are too much to expect 
from an occupied people 
she added that her favorite story was hassan and the monster 
by taghred el najer which tells of a little boy who ignores 
villagers warnings and climbs a mountain to meet the oneeyed 
hairy monster who eats children 
at the top its the monster who is frightened by the boys 
strange appearance his two eyes and fair skin boy and monster 
realize they can be friends despite their differences and fears 
and they walk off together into the sunset

one of the bolder love scenes this movie 
season wont make it to theaters 
a frank encounter between two women from welcome home roxy 
carmichael was left on the cutting room floor what remains is 
a brief scene with two women in a bedroom hinting elliptically at 
their love making 
depictions are more explicit in the upcoming henry and june 
which details the sexual encounters of writer henry miller his 
wife june and writer anais nin in paris in the 1930s there are 
scenes at lesbian social clubs in which women embrace kiss and 
dance together and a brothel scene shows two women making love 
hollywoods continuing difficulty with homosexuality ranges from 
the squeamishness of roxy carmichael to the rancor of bird on 
a wire in the latter film a hairdresser swishes through his 
salon in a wanton stereotype 
yet a swishy role won william hurt an oscar for his performance 
as a homosexual prisoner in kiss of the spider woman 
critics say upcoming films will include negative gay role 
models the gay amp lesbian alliance against defamation glaad says 
the scripts for basic instinct and ticking man are littered 
with villains who are gay they say basic features lesbian and 
bisexual women as murderers and ticking features a man 
described as wierdly effeminate 
what wed like to see is gay and lesbian characters portrayed 
i hope in continuing roles as normal people said richard 
jennings executive director of glaads los angeles chapter the 
group is pleased with the character of a doctors gay brother on 
doctor doctor on cbs 
glaad has placed ads of protest in trade papers but plans no 
boycotts of movies 
a few recent releases have been criticized for allegedly 
fostering antigay violence 
glaad is unhappy with david lynchs wild at heart whose 
lead uses the word faggot and house party where a 
character raps me a homo nah man thats a nono 
itc entertainment groups roxy carmichael distributed by 
paramount pictures is an account of a small towns memory of a 
bisexul teenage woman the film attempted to deal 
straightforwardly with sex between two women 
but at test screenings people were kind of shocked to see the 
two people in bed said the films director jim abrahams i 
thought it was done pretty tastefully i think we miscalculated 
the reaction 
were lucky the scene is in there at all said 
screenwriter karen leigh hopkins paramount was very nervous 
about it and wanted it cut but theres nothing wrong with two 
women being lovers roxy is the hero and shes bisexual 
negative cliched characterizations have been a motionpicture 
staple since 1915s the birth of a nation almost every group 
at one time or another has censured the entertainment industry for 
biased depictions 
some gays have been pleased with such films as the recent 
longtime companion 1959s suddenly last summer and 1968s 
the killing of sister george for the most part though gays 
are unhappy 
in an advertisement taken out in the hollywood trade newspaper 
daily variety last week glaad said gay and lesbian film 
characters are portrayed either as sissies or victims or murderers 
and twisted villains we are verbally abused with offensive terms 
such as faggot and dyke 
this years screen images of violence and abuse fuel a climate 
of increasing antgay violence 
we felt that with the real flood of nothing but negative 
images in films this year that we had to do something dramatic to 
get the industrys attention said jennings 
the new york city police department recorded 64 antigay crimes 
through july up 120 percent from the previous period in 1989 
according to research by the national gay and lesbian task force 
for 1989 there were more than 7000 reported incidents of 
harassment intimidation vandalism or biasrelated violence 
directed against gays including 62 homicides 
the makers of some films under attack say criticisms of gay 
characters are overly emotional 
i didnt realize the word faggot was derogatory said 
steve golin a producer of the samuel goldwyn cos wild at 
heart its just a term thats in our vocabulary the film 
doesnt depict gay people in a negative context 
others responsible for movies under fire say the depictions are 
only meant to be humorous 
and reggie hudlin director of new line cinemas house 
party said the denounced rap lyric is being taken out of 
context its a scene where a kid gets put in jail the musical 
number is a way to defend him against the assault of rape

george williams stood before the 
memorial to the 270 people killed on pan am flight 103 running his 
hand over the engraved name of his only son 
rain pelted against the tombstones in dryfesdale cemetery just 
outside ockerbie but the 59yearold american seemed oblivious to 
discomfort 
he carefully laid a bouquet of white chrysanthemums below the 
sixth column of names etched on the granite monument then he stood 
silently for several minutes occasionally wiping his eyes 
one of the names on that sixth column was george waterson 
williams known by his friends and family as geordie 
a 24yearold us army first lieutenant had been stationed at 
bad kreuznach then west germany he was heading home to spend 
christmas with his parents and missed his direct flight to 
washington because of traffic on the autobahn he boarded pan 
american flight 103 bound for new york instead 
that was dec 21 1988 a day that forever changed the lives of 
george and judy williams of joppatowne md 
a terrorist bomb exploded on the aircraft showering wreckage on 
this quiet scottish town 
williams has since been an active member of us families of the 
victims of pan am 103 helping campaign to find out the truth about 
the crash and improve airport security 
he is the only american relative attending the first public 
inquiry into the crash which opened monday and resumes today in 
nearby dumfries 
i hope the lack of security then and now will be brought to 
light so that it will help this tremendous feeling i have from 
happening to anyone else he said 
you know people say that time eases the pain of loss well 
that might be true for a pet but losing a child it just gets 
worse every day and ill be fighting for justice as long as i have 
left on this earth he said 
they committed the ultimate human rights violation on my son 
they took away a beautiful patriotic young man who loved life 
he said 
this animal who did it deprived me and my wife of watching him 
develop as a human being and of any hope of grandchildren my wife 
is an only child her line ends with her and our son was an only 
child so all reason for existence seems to have ceased 
the silverhaired exmarine a korean war veteran whose nickname 
is whip is unwavering in his goal 
i want people from pan am jailed people from the government 
censured and fired that were involved in the coverup and i want 
the criminals executed he said 
on tuesday afternoon williams made his third visit to 
lockerbie 
first he placed flowers beside two wilting bouquets and a 
childs baseball cap on sherwood crescent where the planes 
fuelladen wing section exploded the crater it formed is now 
covered with neatly clipped grass and the demolished homes are 
being rebuilt 
then he went to the memorial on nearby park place overlooking a 
row of houses geordie was one of 67 victims found there 
his father tearfully laid white chrysanthemums on the simple 
plaque then turned away for several minutes to regain his 
composure as two chattering schoolgirls walked into one of the 
houses 
after dryfesdale cemetery williams went to the remembrance room 
in the cemetery at tundergarth parish church about 5 miles from 
lockerbie where the nose section fell 
there he fingered the page of a book with geordies name one 
page for each victim 
then he wrote geordie a note in the visitors book telling him 
that the us house of representatives had just passed legislation 
to improve airline security and intelligence coordination on 
terrorism 
senate next he wrote 
williams said he is spending his sons insurance money on the 
campaign his wife is under psychiatric care but he cant give up 
if people ask why dont you get on with your life i am by 
making sure everyone elses children out there arent blown out of 
the sky thats what we want he said 
when these low moments hit me i sometimes think ive got to 
quit this and relax but that lasts for only 20 or 30 seconds 
then i grit my teeth i know what my son would want me to do and 
thats what i will do

scientists who studied thumbsucking by fetuses 
reported today that even in the womb lefties are a distinct 
minority 
ultrasound examinations indicated that only 12 of 224 fetuses 
preferred sucking the left thumb the rest favored the right thumb 
the scientists said 
repeated observations of 17 fetuses showed preference for a 
particular thumb continued through pregnancy the position of the 
fetus did not affect thumb preference the researchers said 
the scientists from queens university of belfast in northern 
ireland reported their findings in a letter to the editor in 
todays issue of the british journal nature 
one could speculate that although the initial bias is a result 
of advanced rightsided neuromuscular development its maintenance 
results from reinforcing aspects of thumbsucking wrote peter 
hepper sara shahidullah and raymond white of the universitys 
school of psychology 
they said the result supports the idea that genes determine 
whether one is right or left handed while questioning theories 
that say stress during pregnancy or birth plays a role 
another researcher said in an interview the study does not argue 
against a role for such stress in producing southpaws 
the stress theory assumes that people are usually genetically 
biased to be righthanded but that difficulties such as prolonged 
labor undernourishment as a fetus or caesarean section can affect 
the nervous system and produce a lefthander instead said 
psychology professor stanley coren 
studies show the likelihood of being lefthanded doubles if one 
emerged from such a stressed birth or a difficult pregnancy said 
coren from the university of british columbia at vancouver 
in addition some lefthandedness is thought to be genetic he 
said 
the fetal preference for the right hand supports the idea that 
people are usually biased to be righthanded he said but while 
studies say about 15 percent of children younger than about age 10 
are lefties the fetal study found only about 5 percent favoring 
that hand 
they simply didnt find enough lefthanders coren said 
where do all the extra lefthanders come from 
one possibility is that some righthanded fetuses later shift to 
the left hand because of stress in pregnancy or birth he said 
he also said the fetuses should be studied as children to make 
sure their thumbsucking behavior in the womb really predicts which 
hand will be dominant later on

the little man in the brown jacket looked out of 
place among the darksuited german dignitaries today at the grand 
midnight reception in the reichstag building to celebrate germanys 
reunification 
but someone in the government had remembered lothar nitsche and 
made sure an invitation went out to him 
as a teenager in 1948 nitsche dared to tear down the soviet 
flag from the brandenburg gate when the cold war was gripping 
berlin 
i have a good life effective today the 60yearold nitsche 
said in the old parliament building a few minutes after the 
germanys united at midnight our dreams have come true 
his story told in the copies of old documents he carries like a 
talisman was of a youth spent in war and turmoil and a brief 
moment of fame 42 years ago 
the soviets had imposed their blockade on west berlin in june 
1948 and the usbritish airlift was keeping the city alive with 
food and other supplies 
berliners feared the western world would forget them and on 
sept 9 hundreds of thousands of demonstrators poured into the huge 
square before the brandenburg gate to protest the soviet 
stranglehold 
nitsche then just 18 said he had run through the gate when he 
saw that another young german had managed to reach the top of the 
structure and remove the soviet flag but was frightened away by 
soviet gunfire before he could throw it to the ground 
we were shouting freedom freedom he said and people 
said to get the flag down 
nitsche and another young man i never saw that man before in 
my life climbed the gate reached the red flag and threw it 
down he said 
the dramatic rebellious act was highlighted in newspaper 
accounts of the days demonstration and the soviet gunfire used to 
disperse the crowd 
nitsche said the soviets tried several times to kidnap him 
because of his notoriety 
the us army took him out of berlin for his safety and gave him 
jobs for years afterward in giessen west germany where he married 
and had three children 
despite his brush with the soviets four decades ago nitsche 
said he believes soviet president mikhail s gorbachev is the man 
of the century for what he has done to permit the unification of 
germany and end the division of europe

the search for 13yearold melissa benoit 
ended in a way that has traumatized this picturebook community 
the girls body was found in the basement of her neighbor a father 
of two who had helped look for her 
id rather know that it was just some sicko that grabbed her 
off the street than someone she trusted said michelle ponte who 
lives in nearby plymouth i have a 10yearold daughter who 
absolutely freaked out when she heard this 
the slaying on main street hit just about everyone in this town 
of 8500 where trees are hung with pink ribbons in melissas honor 
and dozens of people including the alleged killer joined the 
search after she disappeared sept 15 
melissas partially clad body was found last week buried in the 
basement of henry meinholz jr he has pleaded innocent to murder 
the cause of death has not been determined 
meinholz lives just a few doors away from the benoits on main 
street right across from the police station he is undergoing 
psychiatric evaluation at a hospital 
this town about 35 miles south of boston is undergoing an 
evaluation of its own as residents struggle to comprehend a crime 
few ever thought would happen here 
meinholzs wife jane a psychiatric nurse said a funeral was 
needed not just for the victim but for everyones sense of trust 
until melissa disappeared i always felt like i was living on 
the safest neighborhood possible in america she said i think 
a lot people in our neighborhood felt that way 
court records reveal that by sept 26 mrs meinholz had told 
fbi agents who had already questioned her husband where to 
search saying i suggest you bring a shovel 
meinholz a bookkeeper at a lumber store was described as 
quiet he was a deacon at first baptist church in plymouth where 
his wife is an organist 
but court affidavits reveal a long history of alleged sexual 
problems that included exposing himself to female hitchhikers and 
making obscene phone calls 
harvard psychology professor richard herrnstein said residents 
basic assumptions about human behavior were shattered by the girls 
death 
i think what happens in situations like that is that people 
depend very much on the predictability of other peoples 
behavior said herrnstein when someone violates those 
expectations especially in a harmful way thats terrifying 
bill po a 65yearold resident agreed you never think its 
going to happen in your town he said 
townspeople have come together to console each other so many 
attended a funeral saturday for melissa that the eulogy was 
broadcast to the crowd outside 
the curious converged on main street near meinholz house 
especially after police started looking for more bodies on his 
property police stopped digging in his back yard friday and said 
they found no evidence of other crimes 
more than 200 people many of them mothers with children 
gathered at the kingston elementary school on tuesday night to talk 
with mental health officials and police 
ultimately herrnstein said time is the only healer 
again people will gradually realize that yes indeed people 
are predictable he said and that will take care of it

secretary of state james a baker iii says there 
is growing sentiment among nations to force iraq to withdraw from 
kuwait and the bush administration is weighing such a military move 
through the united nations 
after a week of talking to other world leaders at the united 
nations baker said tuesday night there is more of a willingness 
to consider some sort of an approach like that if it became 
necessary at an appropriate time than we had anticipated there 
might be at this stage of the conflict 
but he stressed that sentiments could change quickly even in 
one day and he emphasized the administration prefers a diplomatic 
and political solution to iraqs annexation of kuwait and seizure 
of the persian gulf emirates oil fields 
baker spoke at the conclusion of a twoday meeting of 35 foreign 
ministers to prepare for a european security conference summit in 
paris on nov 1921 
asked if the united states had begun to draft a resolution in 
which the un security council would authorize military force 
against iraq as reported sunday by the associated press and 
newsweek magazine baker replied there has been no decision 
taken at the top levels of this government with respect to going 
forward now with respect to a particular resolution 
however he said it would not be prudent of us not to be 
giving some thought to what the various options are and how they 
would be implemented 
us officials told the ap on sunday the back of the 
envelope drafting had begun by the united states the soviet 
union and other governments 
the foreign ministers adopted a resolution condemning iraq for 
its aug 2 invasion of kuwait the statement proposed by the 
united states called for an immediate and unconditional 
withdrawal 
the 12nation european community meanwhile approved nearly 2 
billion in assistance to egypt jordan and turkey to compensate for 
economic hardships arising from the persian gulf conflict 
italian foreign minister gianni de michelis said the community 
would provide 660 million and member nations would provide 132 
billion 
the european security conference ministers took several steps to 
strengthen the organization in preparation for the november summit 
in paris among them were the establishment of a small permanent 
secretariat a group to monitor elections in europe and a center 
designed to prevent conflicts between countries 
but baker stressed there would be no summit unless a treaty to 
reduce us and soviet tanks and other nonnuclear forces in europe 
is ready to be signed 
he said the united states and the soviet union had made good 
progress but noted they had not settled on aircraft ceilings and 
definitions of the zones in which provisions of the agreement will 
apply in addition the two sides must settle verification 
procedures 
he and soviet foreign minister eduard a shevardnadze were 
meeting today to try to wrap up the accord 
with the persian gulf crisis dominating events including the 
un general assembly meeting baker said there was too much 
looking too hard for signals on how the administration was 
leaning on a particular day 
one day i read we are heading for war and the next day i read 
we are headed rapidly toward a peaceful diplomatic solution he 
said 
the truth of the matter is as the president has made very 
clear and others have the strong preference of the united states 
would be to find a way to resolve this matter peacefully 
politically and diplomatically and we will continue to work toward 
that end baker said 
at the same time we cannot exclude the other option and we 
have not excluded it he said 
baker reaffirmed meanwhile that the united states would assist 
israel if it were attacked by iraq 
the commitment to israels security is unshakable he said 
if anything like that were to happen i think there would 
certainly be an appropriate response by the united states 
iraqi president saddam hussein has threatened saudi arabia 
which the united states is defending with 170000 troops and 
israel if economic sanctions threaten to strangle iraq

portraying lazy people as couch potatoes 
is a libel on a vegetable with an important role in feeding a 
hungry world say participants in a conference on the future of the 
potato 
the potato yields more nutritious food quicker on less land 
and under harsher climates than any major crop said robert e 
rhoades a potato researcher stationed in the philippines 
the idea of a lazy potato is a contradiction in terms he 
said 
but rhoades told the smithsonian institution meeting on 
feeding the global village that the potato has been belittled 
ever since it was carried back to europe following christopher 
columbus voyage 
theres an improbable rumor he said that spud comes from 
the acronym for the society for the prevention of an unwholesome 
diet a group that was dedicated to keeping potatoes out of 
england 
the scots originally refused to eat potatoes because they 
werent mentioned in the bible he said and through the ages the 
potato has been accused of causing syphilis rickets tuberculosis 
and lust 
in actual fact the spread of the potato offers a second chance 
to support a population that is outracing its capacity to feed 
itself the conference was told it is grown in 126 countries from 
the arctic to the tropics atop mountains and in the desert 
the first chance was the green revolution which started in 
the 1960s and kept millions alive by developing highyield strains 
of rice corn and wheat but never fully lived up to its promise 
china the worlds rice bowl has replaced poland as the second 
largest potato producer behind the soviet union india is in 
fourth place the united states fifth 
the potatos foremost champion at the conference was researcher 
richard sawyer founder and director general of the international 
potato center in lima peru he said his interest was sharpened 
when he subsisted on stolen seed potatoes while a prisoner of war 
in nazi germany 
changes in the way potatoes are planted promise to make this 
vegetable packed with protein and vitamin c potassium iron and 
magnesium widely available in poor lands where it has been too 
expensive 
potatoes are usually grown from a tuber chunk containing buds or 
eyes research at the potato center made it possible to grow 
them from seeds from the plants flower sawyer reported 
eliminating the need to import seed material at great expense 
i can hold in my hand enough true potato seed to plant a 
hectare 2471 acres whereas it takes 4000 pounds or more of 
tubers to plant the same area sawyer said 
meantime he said scientists have only begun to explore new 
varieties at the peru center he said germplasm seed material 
for about 175 varieties has been collected 
i am confident we have the ability to develop varieties which 
would have resistances to pests and diseases and eliminate 90 
percent of the present use of chemicals on production sawyer 
said what we dont have in the germplasm collection we will 
probably be able to produce through the new tools of 
biotechnology 
rhoades said farmers in the tropics can harvest potatoes within 
50 days of planting a third of the time it takes in colder 
climates wherever temperatures drop at night potatoes can be 
grown he said 
since they grow so fast they can be planted in fields that are 
used at other times of the year to raise rice or wheat he said

cryptic still others were practical all had one thing in common 
a need to communicate with loved ones held hostage in kuwait and 
iraq 
families of the hostages trapped by iraqs aug 2 invasion of 
kuwait began recording messages on a hotline set up tuesday by the 
governmentowned voice of america radio network 
these are radio postcards said voa director richard 
carlson 
the families called in on a special number provided by the state 
department task force that keeps in touch with them the task force 
instructed them to keep their greetings short no longer than 30 
seconds to avoid political views and to refrain from using last 
names so they dont tip off iraqi authorities searching for 
americans in hiding 
hi johnny were having three grandchildren not two 
michelle is having twins said a woman who identified herself 
only as donita of texas youre in my thoughts constantly 
constantly constantly i love you very much i pray for you 
one to sergio from the west coast of mississippi said 
missy will be coming home for thanksgiving i pray youll be here 
too love mickey 
another was to bob from his loving wife sue assuring him 
the family was doing well she added were praying for your safe 
return we miss you very very much come home soon 
jeff taping a message to mike said he had spoken to mrs w 
in new york notre dame has won its first three games we think 
about you every day 
the 30second greetings will be aired starting thursday voa 
which since the gulf crisis began has increased its english and 
arabiclanguage programs to 24 hours a day will broadcast the 
messages in three fiveminute segments during each hour of the 
stations morning news program 
on the first day the messages may be aired in a 15minute 
segment during the stations morning show 
voa which broadcasts news and entertainment in 43 languages 
around the globe said this was a firstofitskind operation 
jamming of voas arabic service which began within hours of the 
iraqi invasion has eased considerably in recent days officials 
are uncertain about the reason 
an estimated 600 to 700 americans are believed trapped in 
kuwait with another 300 to 350 in iraq their families mostly 
women and children were allowed to leave the two countries 
iraqi authorities have rounded up about 100 americans and moved 
them to industrial and military facilities as human shields to 
guard against us bombings 
the rest of the americans in kuwait are hiding from the 
housetohouse searches by iraqi security forces state department 
officials say many of those captured were identified by informants 
who led security forces to their hideouts 
in many cases iraqi troops broke down doors to get into 
apartments where americans were hiding in cramped quarters and 
suffering food shortages and uncertainty about their fate 
a special task force at the state department has been keeping in 
touch with the families in the united states relaying information 
about the hostages if they have it and providing moral support 
the 24hour task force also has started referring families to 
support groups such as the national organization for victim 
assistance 
john stein deputy director of the nonprofit group said 
families call up with practical problems such as money shortages 
and wives need to find jobs and place kids in school 
he said an estimated 2000 families have been affected by the 
iraqi invasion some because their relatives were left behind and 
others in which the entire family fled but members are feeling 
displaced and frightened

a senator is questioning the nomination of 
frederick vreeland to be us ambassador to burma saying vreeland 
may have obstructed an inquiry into the attempted assassination of 
pope john paul ii 
at the request of sen alfonse damato rny the senate 
foreign relations committee on tuesday deleted vreelands name from 
a list of nominations it approved it scheduled a special hearing 
on vreeland for thursday 
the nomination for the post in the southeast asian nation had 
been the subject of a closeddoor hearing on monday 
the washington times reported last week that vreeland is a 
veteran cia operative although his state department biography lists 
28 years of strictly diplomatic assignments 
efforts to reach vreeland of new york were unsuccessful he 
has no number listed in the washington dc or new york city 
telephone directories the cia does not disclose information about 
its past or present agents 
damato in an interview said he would not discuss whether the 
nominee had cia connections but he said i have received 
information that suggests that frederick vreeland was involved in 
putting out disinformation concerning the possible bulgarian and 
soviet involvement in the attempted assassination of pope john paul 
ii 
mehmet ali agca a turk is serving a life term in italy for the 
may 18 1981 shooting in st peters square agca at first said he 
acted alone but later claimed he planned the attack with soviet 
help in 1986 three turks and three bulgarians were acquitted of 
involvement 
the state department says vreeland was an embassy counselor and 
political officer in rome at the time of the assassination attempt 
and the investigation 
on monday damato asked the committee to review vreelands 
nomination and schedule the second hearing 
i believe that there are serious questions concerning mr 
vreeland that deserve more thorough examination damato said 
the biography sent by the white house to the senate on president 
bushs nominee for ambassador to the troubled nation of burma 
describes a routine foreign service career 
it says vreeland has been vice president of john cabot 
international college in rome since last year and was a 
contributing editor to conde nast traveler magazine in 1988 and 
director of the aspen institute in 198587 
his state department assignments from 1957 to 1985 include 
economic officer in berlin and rabat and political officer in bonn 
paris and rome as well as an assignment with the us mission to 
the united nations 
damato said that if vreelands reported cia background proves 
to be true it could exacerbate the situation in burma where 
diplomats have reported recent harassment by soldiers 
diplomats interviewed in bangkok last week reported incidents 
involving the us british and west german embassies in rangoon 
the state department confirmed that burmas military rulers 
detained and interrogated four burmese employees of the us 
embassy about mission operations and personnel 
on sunday 11 senators including damato signed a letter to 
bush asking for strong economic sanctions against burma for its 
military leaders refusal to turn over power to an elected civilian 
government and its holding of political prisoners

in this village once known as little 
berlin because of its dividing border wall more than 5000 people 
held a huge unification bash on what used to be a death strip 
splitting the hamlet in half 
a notable turnout since the entire village consists of about a 
dozen homes and 60 people including the eastern part formerly 
under communist control 
thousands of outsiders had flocked to moedlareuth from 
surrounding communities in this forest farmland and from even 
farther away to celebrate the marriage of the two germanys 
the throng carrying torches and tankards of beer roared 
approval as a leading bavarian politician said there can never 
again be walls dividing germans or border guards threatening the 
lives of innocent people 
these are things that must be forever banned from german 
soil declared erwin huber chief of the christian social union 
bavarian sister party to chancellor helmut kohls christian 
democrats 
moedlareuth which borders on bavaria and thuringia was divided 
from 1945 until november 1989 
in 1952 border fortifications were installed communist armed 
patrols tripwire shooting devices and guard dogs were brought in 
to what became known as death strip although no one is 
actually known to have been killed trying to flee across it to the 
west 
the same year the border fortifications went up the local miller 
escaped out a window as communist authorities began tearing down 
his mill to keep it from being used as a hiding place for wouldbe 
escapees 
in 1966 a concrete wall 2160 feet long was built guards in an 
observation tower had shoottokillorders 
foot and vehicle traffic between east and west moedlareuth was 
stopped 
only rare visits were allowed to the western district of the 
village by the communists and none to the eastern section 
president bush visited the village when he was vice president 
and called it little berlin 
on tuesday night moedlareuth vibrated with music and joy 
fireworks screamed across the sky at midnight as the border that 
once cut through moedlareuth and the rest of germany vanished 
people from the eastern section of moedlareuth like 62yearold 
farmer rudolf richter knew well why a celebration was in order 
he recalled my cousins lived just 100 meters 330 feet away 
an i wasnt even allowed to wave to them from here 
hundreds of revelers jammed inside a tent on the former death 
strip dancing to rock music and swigging beer 
many celebrants stared at the 990foot wall section that 
remains 
authorities want to keep it as a reminder

nasa got a cool response to its first effort 
to arrange private financing for space projects partly because it 
turned out the government way was cheaper a government study says 
private concerns were not willing to invest in most of the 
projects because they perceived few or no commercial markets for 
them said the general accounting office which reviewed the nasa 
effort 
the space agency sought private financing last year for seven 
projects worth nearly 800 million but only one wound up being 
commercialized gao said 
a cornerstone of the united states space policy under presidents 
bush and ronald reagan has been to increase private sector 
investment to that end bushs budget last year proposed private 
financing for the projects in the space shuttle and space station 
programs 
the gao said it reviewed nasas actions because this was the 
first effort of this type 
not only did private industry not see a commercial market said 
gao about half the projects were believed too far along in 
development to modify for commercial use without added expense and 
delay for some the financial risk was judged to be too high 
private financing would have significantly increased the 
governments cost for some projects the study said 
the ventures were an advanced solid rocket motor production 
facility in yellow creek miss a weightlessness laboratory at the 
johnson space center in houston a space station payload processing 
facility at the kennedy space center in florida a processing 
laboratory for observational instruments at the jet propulsion 
laboratory in california a robotic arm and a docking system for 
the space station and equipment to make the shuttle able to fly 
16day missions 
nasa rejected financing proposals for three of the four 
construction jobs because they would have been significantly more 
costly than if the money was provided by the government 
even the remaining construction proposal was more expensive gao 
said but nasa concluded that the cost difference of about 4 
percent or 16 million was insignificant 
it turned out that only one project was commercialized it 
involved private financing for a pallet to carry extra oxygen and 
hydrogen for long duration flights 
private financing of space projects was intended to help reduce 
nasa spending gao said but added it is an unlikely 
possibility that private industry can borrow money cheaper than 
government 
because it expected private financing nasa removed the seven 
projects from its budget requests then had to reinstate them 
because of the lack of response gao said nasa jumped the gun and 
failed to evaluate the proposals properly 
gao addressed the report to nasa administrator richard truly 
along with recommendations that the space agency work on screening 
criteria for commercialization candidates and that it keep such 
projects in the budget until financing is found 
the decision to seek private financing was made jointly by nasa 
and the presidents office of management and budget and the space 
agency responded that it is not entirely a free agent in the 
budget decision process 
omb associate director robert e grady said the study overstated 
the conclusion that private industry saw no money to be made in the 
projects 
nasa received many expressions of interest in the two space 
station facilities and received specific proposals on five of the 
seven projects he said unfortunately in most cases the 
proposals were not economically viable because of the unwillingness 
of the private sector to accept an appropriate level of risk

rob mosbacher is the son of us commerce 
secretary robert mosbacher but he is depicting himself as an 
outsider to texas politics in a bid to become the states 
lieutenant governor 
democrat bob bullock calls the 39yearold mosbacher junior 
and says he is a republican party groupie mosbacher refers to 
his opponent as bureaucrat bob bullock has been the states 
comptroller for the past 15 years 
gubernatorial candidates ann richards and clayton williams have 
grabbed most of the attention in this election year but the title 
of lieutenant governor carries real power with it in the lone star 
state 
the lieutenant governor controls the flow of legislation in the 
senate and appoints committee chairmen lt gov bill hobby has 
held the post since 1972 but decided not to seek reelection 
his criticisms of bullock notwithstanding mosbacher has 
bureaucratic problems of his own 
he was appointed chairman of the texas department of human 
services in 1987 and the agencys financial difficulties hang like 
an albatross around his neck state lawmakers have twice bailed out 
the department with emergency appropriations 
some legislators predict a tax bill will be necessary next year 
due largely to problems at mosbachers agency the department 
which provides assistance to more than 600000 texans has 
requested an additional 25 billion 
running on his record bullock 61 says he has transformed a 
sleepy agency into a modern efficient revenuecollecting office 
mosbacher alleges there has been extravagant spending in the 
comptrollers office 
if theres anything thats missing particularly in every 
agency that i know of in state government its a matter of 
effectively establishing accountability for what youre spending 
said mosbacher 
mosbacher says bullocks long tenure in government has put him 
out of touch and made him part of our problem 
bullock defends the expenditures welcomes comparing the 
efficiency of dhs and the comptrollers office and has released 
his own list of questionable purchases by mosbachers agency 
bullock says mosbachers claim to be an outsider in austin is 
phony mosbacher whose father was the chief fundraiser for 
president bush before he became commerce secretary also ran in the 
1984 gop senate primary against phil gramm 
bullock says mosbacher has botched the only responsibility hes 
been given and is spending his inheritance trying to buy an elected 
office 
hes in over his head if he had started out and worked 
himself up in government and learned what was actually happening 
it would be different bullock said 
mosbacher blames his departments problems on a lack of 
legislative financing and unexpected costs due to expansion of 
coverage mandated by congress he says that as lieutenant governor 
he will bring new ideas and a businessmans approach to state 
government 
bullock touts his experience in collecting taxes and the budget 
process saying his expertise is needed to grapple with budget 
problems on the horizon 
mosbacher has linked himself to republican gubernatorial nominee 
williams who holds an edge over democrat richards in voter 
surveys 
if youre going to elect clayton williams as governor and you 
want him to go to austin to shake things up dont send him 
alone mosbacher says

here is the text of president bushs address 
to the american people tuesday night 
tonight i want to talk to you about a problem that has lingered 
and dogged and vexed this country for far too long the federal 
budget deficit thomas paine said many years ago these are the 
times that try mens souls as we speak our nation is standing 
together against saddam husseins aggression but here at home 
there is another threat a cancer gnawing away at our nations 
health that cancer is the budget deficit year after year it 
mortgages the future of our children 
no family no nation can continue to do business the way the 
federal government has been operating and survive when you get a 
bill that bill must be paid and when you write a check youre 
supposed to have money in the bank but if you dont obey these 
simple rules of common sense theres a price to pay but for too 
long the nations business in washington has been conducted as if 
these basic rules did not apply well these rules do apply and if 
we fail to act next year alone we will face a federal budget 
deficit of more than 300 billion a deficit that could weaken our 
economy further and cost us thousands of precious jobs 
if what goes up must come down then the way down could be very 
hard but it doesnt have to be that way we can do something in 
fact we have started to do something but we must act this week 
when congress will hold the first of two crucial upordown votes 
these votes will be on a deficit reduction agreement worked out 
between the administration and the bipartisan leaders of congress 
this budget agreement is the result of eight months of blood sweat 
and fears fears of the economic chaos that would follow if we fail 
to reduce the deficit 
of course i cannot claim its the best deficit reduction plan 
possible its not any one of us alone might have written a better 
plan but it is the best agreement that can be legislated now it 
is the biggest deficit reduction agreement ever half a trillion 
dollars its the toughest deficit reduction package ever with new 
enforcement rules to make sure that what we fix now stays fixed 
and it has the largest spending savings ever more than 300 
billion for the first time a republican president and leaders of 
the democratic congress have agreed to real cuts that will be 
enforced by law not promises no smoke no mirrors no magic act 
but real and lasting spending cuts

this agreement will also raise revenue im not and i know 
youre not a fan of tax increases but if there have to be tax 
measures they should allow the economy to grow they should not 
turn us back to higher income tax rates andthey should be fair 
everyone who can should contribute something and no one should have 
to contribute beyond their fair share our bipartisan agreement 
meets these tests and through specific new incentives it will help 
create more jobs 
its a little known fact but americas best job creators and 
greatest innovators tend to be our smaller companies so our budget 
plan will smalland mediumsize companies a needed shot in the arm 
just as important i am convinced that this agreement will help 
lower interest rates and lower interest rates means savings for 
consumers lower mortgage payments for new homeowners and more 
investment to produce more jobs and thats what this agreement 
will do 
and now let me tell you what this agreement will not do it will 
not raise income tax rates personal or corporate it will not mess 
with social security in any way it will not put americas national 
security at risk and most of all it will not let our economy slip 
out of control 
clearly each and every one of us can find fault with something 
in this agreement in fact that is a burden that any truly fair 
solution must carry any workable solution must be judged as a 
whole not piece by piece those who dislike one part or another 
may pick our agreement apart but if they do believe me the 
political reality is no one can put a better one back together 
again 
everyone will bear a small burden but if we succeed every 
american will have a large burden lifted if we fail to enact this 
agreement our economy will falter markets may tumble and 
recession will follow in just a moment the democratic majority 
leader senator mitchell will offer what is known as the 
democratic response often a rebuttal but not tonight 
tonight the democratic and republican leadership and i all 
speak with one voice in support of this agreement tonight we ask 
you to help us move this agreement forward the congressional 
leadership and i both have a job to do in getting it enacted and 
tonight i ask for your help 
first i ask you to understand how important and for some how 
difficult this vote is for your congressmen and senators many 
worry about your reaction to one part or another but i know you 
know the importance of the whole and so second i ask you to take 
this initiative tell your congressmen and senators you support 
this deficit reduction agreement 
if they are republicans urge them to stand with the president 
urge them to do what the bipartisan leadership has done come 
together in the spirit of compromise to solve this national 
problem if theyre democrats urge them to stand with their 
congressional leaders ask them to fight for the future of your 
kids by supporting this budget agreement now is the time for you 
the american people to have a real impact 
your senators and congressmen need to know that you want this 
deficit brought down that the time for politics and posturing is 
over and the time to come together is now this deficit reduction 
agreement is tough and so are the times the agreement is fair and 
so is the american spirit the agreement is bipartisan and so is 
the vote the agreement is real and so is this crisis 
this is the first time in my presidency that i have made an 
appeal like this to you the american people with your help we can 
at last put this budget crisis behind us and face the other 
challenges that lie ahead if we do the longterm result will be a 
healthier nation and something more we will have once again put 
ourselves on the path of economic growth and we will have 
demonstrated that no challenge is greater than the determination of 
the american people 
thank you god bless you and good night

president bushs televised address to the nation tuesday night 
delivered by senate majority leader george mitchell dmaine 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
i speak tonight not for the democratic party but for americas 
future 
for more than a decade the united states has endured budget 
deficits that sap our economic strength when you have a deficit 
there are only two things you can do cut spending or increase 
revenue this agreement does both 
it cuts spending military and domestic it raises taxes 
the president has asked you to support the budget agreement the 
democratic leadership in congress joins in that appeal we 
recognize that this budget demands sacrifice from all americans 
but if enacted it holds the promise of restoring a sound 
economy from which all americans will benefit 
the agreement is a compromise its not what the president 
working alone would have preferred its not what we democrats 
working on our own would have produced neither side got all it 
wanted 
and many are asking why did it take so long the answer is 
simple what delayed us for months is what has divided us for 
years democrats and republicans have deep differences over values 
and priorities 
we prefer a budget that asks more from the wealthy and less from 
the elderly but when the president asked us to join in rewriting 
his budget we agreed because the nation is more important than 
partisan differences 
when the president asked us to help work out a compromise he got 
our help now we hope that members of his party the republican 
members of congress will also set aside partisan differences as 
we have done and join us in doing whats right for our country 
two centuries ago the constitutional convention in philadelphia 
was drawing to a close the delegates had quarreled for months now 
they were to vote on a difficult compromise benjamin franklin 81 
years old rose slowly and said to his fellow delegates i 
confess that there are several parts of this constitution which i 
do not approve but i doubt whether any other convention may be 
able to make a better constitution for when you assemble men to 
have the advantage of their joint wisdom you inevitably assemble 
all their prejudices their passions their errors of opinion 
their local interests their selfish views from such an assembly 
can a perfect production be expected i consent to this 
constitution because i expect no better and because i am not sure 
it is not the best 
of course no budget can be compared with the constitution but 
franklins point applies every human work is imperfect and thats 
certainly true of this budget 
but its also true that for americas economic future we have 
to pass it with your help we will 
thank you and good night

trustees at the university of the district of 
columbia and striking students are deadlocked over a demand that 11 
of the 15 trustees resign before the weekold shutdown of the 
school can be resolved 
but trustee a knighton stanley one of the 11 board members 
appointed by mayor marion barry that students want replaced said 
tuesday that if the panel was essentially replaced en masse as the 
students want it could affect the universitys accreditation 
we have negotiated back and forth on that issue we have 
stalemated and we have made our final offer he said the ball 
is back in the students court the challenge is theirs 
another negotiating session was scheduled today 
stanley submitted his resignation effective next march 31 on 
tuesday four other board members also have stepped down or 
announced plans to do so 
student spokesman mark thompson said the protest will continue 
at the 12000student university until the board is replaced 
we need a victory so that never again anyone will be able to 
say anything negative about the students from udc thompson said 
he also said the occupation of the administration building will 
continue even though some students want to return to classes which 
have been disrupted since the beginning of the boycott on sept 26 
the students have demanded extensive changes in the way the 
university is run and improvements in several athletic and academic 
programs they say the board has allowed the quality of the school 
to decline and put the accreditations of some of its departments in 
jeopardy 
feminist artist judy chicago also withdrew her donation of a 
sculpture that had been the target of student protests she said 
the dinner party was being withdrawn in support of the 
students right to determine their own destiny 
students were upset about a trustee plan to spend 16 million 
for renovations to a library so chicagos work could be installed 
there the house of representatives withdrew the same amount from 
the schools appropriations package in protest of udcs intentions

jovial west german boys spent the night firing 
their flare guns at a little east german car suspended by a giant 
crane 
a woman leaned on a railing over the spree river dressed in a 
smartly tailored soviet majors uniform she said she wanted to 
feel like an occupying power 
a man wearing a black ski mask sat in a lawn chair in the heart 
of the celebrations over german unity passing out leaflets 
explaining why it should not take place 
too late germany became one nation today but it was clear that 
its inhabitants are still two people 
for west germans the celebration was pure a victory 
but for east germans it was tinged with angst many are now out 
of work or will be soon and must find a way to fit into a 
foreign society 
an estimated 1 million people gathered for the moment at 
midnight and a nearly full moon a brace of searchlights and a 
seemingly endless supply of fireworks lighted up the clear night 
sky 
it was the most festive and the most orchestrated of the mass 
street celebrations that have marked east germanys transition from 
a communist country to a free nation to part of a new germany 
a giant german flag was raised over the reichstag the old 
parliament building near where the berlin wall once divided the 
city 
masses of people surrounded the building in the chilly clear 
night and packed the nearby plaza of the gigantic brandenburg gate 
many joined in an emotional chorus of the national anthem 
harmut giese watched the scene from nearby potsdamer platz the 
oncebustling main square of old berlin reduced to a muddy field by 
the berlin wall 
this was overdone all of this money said the 46yearold 
east german a teacher at a machinists trade school 
but we need things like this to help bring us together to 
give us something to share he said even children in 
kindergarten here think in terms of communism closed borders 
everything is still new 
giese said his 19yearold daughter was a dissident during the 
old days and was relentlessly harassed by the communist secret 
police he said she now lives in west germany 
it was hard for us he said 
standing not too far away with his wife and two children was 
wolf glaeser an employee for the east german airline interflug he 
said hes losing his job by years end 
i came for the fireworks he said unity is soso there 
are just too many economic problems for me 
east berlins main avenue the broad unter den linden was a 
surging tide of shouldertoshoulder celebrants who flowed from one 
side of downtown to the other 
swing rock and jazz bands lined the promenade restaurants 
pushed bratwurst and beer peddlers hawked unity tshirts and 
welldressed people wore balloons on their heads 
heide thielbeer of hamburg stopped pedestrian traffic and drew 
gawks 
miss theilbeer tested east germans inherent animosity for their 
soviet occupiers by wearing a soviet majors jacket and hat and 
black tights 
i wanted to see what it would be like to be an occupying power 
in east germany expecially now that the soviets have to go away 
she said 
she would not give her age but i was born during stalingrad 
darling she said referring to the 194243 battle during which 
the soviets defeated the nazi army the battle is considered a 
turning point in the war 
leftist radicals held scattered protests in both sides of 
berlin 
about 200 brought shrill whistles to the schauspielhaus the 
opera house in east berlin where a ritzy preunity party was thrown 
for top german politicians 
they jeered at the arriving guests blew their whistles and 
chanted germany drop dead 
the surreal scene near brandenburg as bright as daylight under 
the glare of floodlights inexplicably included a giant crane 
holding aloft a tiny trabant the twocylinder auto that stopped 
rolling off assembly lines as soon as east germans were able to buy 
western cars 
west german youths with flare guns spent their time firing at 
it and frequently hitting it the obsolete east german flag 
hanging below it was tattered by nights end 
a 24yearold east berliner who refused to give his name sat in 
a lawn chair in front of brandenburg gate surrounded by thousands 
of jubilant prounity celebrants 
he passed out pamphlets while wearing a black ski mask unity 
was too costly and unfair to germans in both sides it said 
people here have been giving me trouble he said

david souter of new hampshire will take his 
oath next week as a supreme court justice with the nation watching 
how hell vote on abortion and other contentious social issues 
the senate voted 909 tuesday to confirm souter 51 as the 
105th member of the high court in the nations history 
the court immediately announced that chief justice william h 
rehnquist will swear in souter next tuesday morning just before 
the supreme court begins hearing the second week of arguments in 
its 199091 term 
the first major case souter will hear concerns a sexbias 
dispute at issue is whether employers may exclude all women of 
childbearing age from some hazardous jobs and the courts decision 
could affect millions of women 
issues of sex discrimination race discrimination and especially 
abortion rights were at the core of opposition to souter within and 
outside the senate 
the handful who voted against him and many voting for the 
nomination worried aloud that he would side with the courts 
conservatives and overrule roe vs wade the 1973 ruling that 
legalized abortion 
to many democrats who voted for souter his record on these 
social issues was troubling but his testimony encouraging even 
though he refused to be pinned down especially on the politically 
hot abortion decision 
sen herb kohl dwis a member of the senate judiciary 
committee said there appeared to be two judge souters 
the judge souter who testified before our committee did not 
seem locked to the past and that was the one he was voting for 
kohl said he added that he hoped the senate had not been deceived 
hes about the best we can expect from my perspective from 
this administration judiciary committee chairman joseph biden 
ddel said of president bushs first supreme court nominee 
but the national abortion rights action league said the senate 
made a dangerous leap of faith that could lead to the defeat of 
abortion rights and a return to backalley abortions 
souter toasted the vote with champagne in concord nh and 
pledged to return the nations confidence in him 
i have been given much and much will be expected of me in 
return and i will make that return to you and i will make it in 
the fullest measure that i can he said 
sen edward m kennedy dmass and other democrats who opposed 
the nomination said they would not give souter the benefit of the 
doubt 
souter could solidify a 54 anticivil rights antiprivacy 
majority on the court said kennedy repeating the argument he 
made as the only member of the senate judiciary committee to oppose 
the nomination 
in addition to kennedy those voting against souter all 
democrats were alan cranston of california daniel akaka of 
hawaii brock adams of washington bill bradley and frank 
lautenberg of new jersey quentin burdick of north dakota john 
kerry of massachusetts and barbara mikulski of maryland sen pete 
wilson rcalif did not vote 
biden warned bush that the next nominee might not get confirmed 
if the president moved further to the right 
i want to express the hope that the administration will not 
learn the wrong lesson from the lopsided senate vote on souter 
biden said a more doctrinaire conservative could well fall 
outside the sphere of acceptability he said 
souter who lives in rural weare nh near concord is a 
graduate of harvard college and harvard law school and a rhodes 
scholar 
after law school souter returned home to practice and soon 
began working in the judicial system of his home state working his 
way up to attorney general trial judge and then the state supreme 
court 
last april he was confirmed by the senate to the 1st us 
circuit court of appeals in boston 
souter will fill the seat vacated by the retirement of justice 
william brennan in july he almost certainly will vote more 
conservatively than the liberal brennan and conservatives were 
pleased 
hes just exactly the kind of person with a broad background 
that we need on the supreme court said sen orrin hatch rutah 
i think he showed that he is a person of fairness hes willing 
to listen hes a person of independence

an aspirin every other day may help prevent 
migraines among some of the millions of americans who suffer theexcruciating 
headaches scientists reported today 
the findings in the journal of the american medical association 
are from the same study that found aspirin effective in preventing 
a first heart attack 
the researchers found that a group of men who took one aspirin 
every other day reported 20 percent fewer migraines than a similar 
group that took a dummy tablet 
headache experts called the research results encouraging but 
they said aspirin could offer at best only a partial solution to 
the migraine puzzle 
nevertheless theres enough evidence here that healthcare 
practitioners should consider aspirin for migraine treatment 
said julie e buring leader of the team at bostons brigham and 
womens hospital that reported the findings 
an estimated 20 percent of american adults suffer migraines 
headache experts say there is no known single cause of migraines 
the severe headaches often accompanied by nausea appear to be 
triggered in some patients by certain foods and also seem related 
to stress and a lack of regular sleep meals and exercise 
buring and her colleagues analyzed five years of data from the 
physicians health study a project involving about 22000 us male 
physicians that began in 1982 
the project is devoted to studying the effects of aspirin and 
beta carotene an orange pigment found in certain fruits and 
vegetables on heart disease migraine and cancer 
of the approximately 11000 doctors who took aspirin 661 
reported migraines at some time after the study began compared with 
818 of those who took the aspirin placebo 
the researchers did not analyze the data regarding beta carotene 
and migraine buring said in a telephone interview 
she said the aspirin portion of the study ended in 1988 when the 
researchers felt compelled to report a finding that those on the 
aspirin regimen had a 44 percent lower risk of developing a first 
heart attack 
aspirin may help prevent migraines for the same reason it helps 
prevent heart attacks buring said in low doses it hinders the 
formation of clumps of blood platelets which cause blood clots 
the effect disappears at higher doses 
when platelets unite they send into the bloodstream a substance 
called serotonin that is also released shortly before a migraine 
attack in most sufferers buring said 
by hindering the release of serotonin aspirin may prevent the 
chain of events that culminate in a migraine said buring herself 
a migraine sufferer 
in an accompanying editorial dr dj dalessio of scripps 
clinic and research foundation of la jolla calif suggested 
doctors incorporate aspirin into their treatment of men who suffer 
migraine attacks at least weekly 
doctors have had some success treating migraines with 
medications including antiinflammatory and antidepressant drugs 
said dr robert s kunkel head of the headache section at the 
cleveland clinic foundation in cleveland 
but aspirin would be preferable said dr alexander mauskop who 
runs a headache clinic at the state university of new york health 
science center in brooklyn 
it certainly would be cheaper because aspirin costs about a 
penny a pill he said and it would have the additional benefit 
of preventing strokes and heart attacks

gov l douglas wilder accused democratic 
national chairman ron h brown of breaking a promise to oppose tax 
increases that would hurt the middle class 
in a letter to the party chairman wilder a democrat said 
brown had promised democrats would fight for tax cuts for 
middleclass americans who were hurt most by republicanbacked tax 
increases in the 1980s 
you have now repudiated your previous positions and have 
joined in support of the tax increases you previously said would be 
unfair to the very people we need to protect wilder wrote 
tuesday 
brown said he would support the budget compromise drafted by 
congressional leaders and the bush administration because it is 
preferable to automatic spending cuts that would go into effect 
without the tax increases the compromise calls for increasing 
taxes on gasoline liquor and luxury items and reducing medicare 
benefits 
laura f dillard wilders press secretary said the governor 
thinks federal budget negotiators should have looked harder for 
spending cuts before raising taxes

senate majority leader george mitchell 
dmaine is urging americans to support a 500 billion deficit 
reduction package because the nation is more important than 
partisan differences 
mitchell in a televised speech tuesday night that followed a 
similar appearance by president bush said the proposal holds the 
promise of restoring a sound economy 
just moments before mitchell spoke the president called the 
package negotiated by his administration and congressional leaders 
the best agreement that can be legislated now 
mitchell reminded viewers that the two parties still have deep 
differences over values and priorities that delayed an agreement 
for months 
we prefer a budget that asks more from the wealthy and less 
from the elderly he said 
his remark referred to the democrats preference for higher 
taxes on wealthy americans as the price for a bush proposal to 
reduce the capital gains tax these differences produced a 
stalemate and both ites were dropped from the budget agreement 
mitchells comment on the party divisions drew an immediate 
reaction from rep jerry lewis rcalif chairman of the house 
republican conference in a statement after bush and mitchell 
spoke lewis said george mitchells partisan shots at capital 
gains in his response was most disturbing 
he more than anyone else is responsible for the death of 
capital gains in the budget package 
but lewis only had praise for the president commenting that 
bush stepped up to the plate tonight and hit the ball clear out 
of the park his appeal to the american people will make the 
difference 
he called the upcoming votes on the package the most important 
of the bush presidency thus far and predicted a lastminute 
surge of support will win passage of the compromise 
while conservative house republicans have led the way in 
opposing the compromise a liberal democrat said he also would 
fight the package 
the proposal would raise taxes on gasoline alcohol cigarettes 
boats and furs while trimming benefits to farmers and medicare 
recipients it also would raise taxes for people who earn more than 
100000 
rep john lewis dga said the plan places too heavy a burden 
on the backs of low and middleincome taxpayers defense cuts 
would be too small and upperincome americans would not be taxed 
enough he said 
it is a plan without compassion lewis said it is not 
right it is not just it is not fair 
lewis said the proposal abandons the constituencies the 
democrats have long represented democrats cannot afford to turn 
their backs on working people we cannot turn our backs on the 
elderly 
mitchell speaking on behalf of his party said that when bush 
asked democrats to join in rewriting the white house budget plan 
we agreed because the nation is more important than partisan 
differences 
mitchell called the package imperfect and said neither 
side got what it wanted 
and he added we recognize that this budget demands sacrifice 
from all americans

secretary of state james a baker iii has 
reached an agreement with israeli foreign minister david levy that 
will provide israel with a 400 million loan guarantee for housing 
baker said late tuesday that key provisions include israeli 
assurances that soviet jews would not be settled in 
israelioccupied areas held by the arabs before the 1967 middle 
east war 
presumably that includes the portion of jerusalem that jordan 
held as well as the west bank also held by jordan and gaza held 
by egypt 
baker said at a news conference that israel also would affirm 
that it is not providing incentives for soviet immigrants to settle 
in those areas 
congress approved the loan guarantee three months ago however 
the bush administration insisted on assurances from jerusalem that 
jewish settlements would not be furthered as a result 
less than 2 percent of the record influx of soviet jews wind up 
on the west bank or in gaza according to the israeli government 
the bush administration wants israel to withdraw from most if 
not all of the land in exchange for arab recognition as part of an 
overall middle east agreement 
baker said we have a major difference of opinion with israel 
on settlements 
israel will obtain the 400 million from commercial banks most 
of them american with the us government guaranteeing the loans

administration in determining eligibility for disability benefits 
is ignoring many of the diseases and infections that are common in 
women infected with the virus 
the result is that many women with disabling conditions 
including gynecological disorders like pelvic inflammatory disease 
and chronic vaginal infections are denied benefits the protesters 
said 
these disorders are not on a list of infections and diseases 
used by the centers for disease control to define aids much of the 
list was compiled in the early days of the epidemic when most aids 
victims were white middleclass homosexual men 
but this definition misses the ailments and conditions common to 
women infected with the human immunodeficiency virus or hiv which 
causes aids the activists said 
social security commissioner gwendolyn king said officials 
awarding disability benefits are not limited by the cdc definition 
of aids 
officials can award up to three months of supplemental security 
income payments immediately upon request to people who have any of 
the aidsrelated conditions on cdcs list pending a final decision 
on the claim she said 
but social security officials also can and do give this 
threemonth presumptive disability status to people who are sick 
with hiv infection but have not progressed into aids she said in a 
statement

the environmental protection agency fails to 
monitor the effectiveness of disinfectants and up to 20 percent of 
the products sold to kill diseasecausing germs may not work 
according to a government study 
in a report released to congress on tuesday the general 
accounting office said the epa has not inspected the majority of 
laboratories that test disinfectants and that the agency lacks 
assurance methods to prove the germkillers are valid 
the gao report said estimates by the epas own experts are that 
an estimated 20 percent of all disinfectants fail to kill germs or 
viruses as they are supposed to and that tests in some states show 
that more than 40 percent of the compounds are ineffective 
the epa is directed by law to register disinfectants and to 
assure that they are effective but the gao said the agency depends 
on test data submitted by manufacturers and that the epa lacks 
assurance that the test methods and performance standards used 
are valid 
anne lindsay the epa official who supervises the disinfectant 
registration said her agency has monitored labs that do about 40 
percent of the testing she also said the agency is developing a 
reenforcement strategy to assure that manufacturers accurately 
report test data

the president of the dartmouth review has 
resigned rather than wear the albatross of antisemitism 
because of the publication of a passage from hitlers mein 
kampf in the combative student weekly 
i joined a paper which embraced the conservative ideals and 
attacked issues with daring style often toeing the line of good 
taste c tyler white said tuesday publicly insulting and 
degrading the jewish faith is neither a conservative ideal nor is 
it in good taste 
the resignation of tyler and two review writers came as a 
petition drive against the review collected more than 2000 
signatures a protest rally of students and administrators was 
planned for thursday on the ivy league campus 
the main message were trying to get across to the nation 
and the national media is that the dartmouth review in no way 
represents the campus said brian ellner president of the 
student assembly which represents the 3200 undergraduates 
the newspaper which is not affiliated with dartmouth college 
has in the past attacked blacks women and homosexuals and tangled 
with professors 
the latest uproar involved an issue that was distributed 
saturday on yom kippur the jewish day of atonement and judaisms 
most solemn day 
the quotation from hitler was inserted unattributed into the 
reviews masthead therefore i believe today that i am acting in 
the sense of the almighty creator by warding off the jews i am 
fighting for the lords work 
review editors said the passage was put in by an unknown staffer 
without their knowledge the review called the incident sabotage 
and offered heartfelt apologies to jews at dartmouth and to the 
dartmouth community at lage 
but white said the response didnt express the staffs regret or 
take responsibility for the passage getting into print and now 
we all must wear the albatross of antisemitism 
college officials joined students in condemning the weekly 
president james freedman and other administrators planned to speak 
at the rally 
i think the campus is still in a state of semishock over this 
in the sense that it is an assault to the entire community 
said dean edward shanahan 
students have published the review since 1980 with backing from 
some of the nations most prominent conservatives 
one frequent target for criticism is william cole a black music 
professor who resigned in august after seven years of being 
belittled in print as a mediocre teacher cole said his 
effectiveness had been compromised 
cole filed a 600000 libel suit against the paper in 1983 it 
was settled out of court for no money two years later 
review staffers also were involved in a sledgehammer attack on 
shanties erected on campus as part of a protest against segregation 
in south africa several years ago several staffers were suspended

profit taking erased the markets early gains and the dollar 
closed marginally lower against the yen 
the 225issue nikkei stock average which gained 267655 points 
tuesday in its largest singleday rise ever fell 4902 points or 
021 percent ending the day at 2284939 the index added 33116 
points before falling back in the afternoon 
the dollar closed at 13665 yen down 008 yen from tuesdays

13621 yen and 13670 yen 
stock traders said the index lost almost 600 points in the first 
30 minutes of afternoon trading on profit taking following 
tuesdays jump 
they said the indexs morning gain reflected optimism following 
mondays finance ministry announcement to take measures to support 
the stock market as well as declining oil prices and positive 
developments in the middle east 
the stock support measures aimed at spurring buying and 
reducing market volatility included easing restrictions on the 
purchase of stock on credit and shortening the hours for futures 
and options trading to curb speculation 
also finance minister ryutaro hashimoto hinted monday of the 
possibility of easing interest rates temporarily to save the ailing 
stock market 
on the foreign exchange dealers said falling oil prices 
triggered the dollars slip against the yen early wednesday 
but trading became volatile as market players made different 
interpretations of hashimotos remarks said minori takeuchi a 
dealer with chemical bank in tokyo 
lowering the interest rate encourages yen sales overseas 
whereas it is a yenbuying factor here because they lower rates 
would help the tokyo stock market recover she said 
ms takeuchi said the rising nikkei stock average and falling 
oil prices stimulated yen buying among japanese currency investors 
wednesday but nobody is expecting much change from the current 
level

four people who say a snooty bouncer at a 
chic nightclub denied them entry and made them feel like scum 
because of their unhip clothing are asking a judge to decide 
whether thats cool under the law 
the four argued tuesday in small claims court that their civil 
rights were violated they want damages of 250 apiece 
the four a lawyer a termite company operator an accountant 
and an accounting manager from the san fernando valley said they 
were rejected by a doorman at the mayan a trendy downtown club 
that used to be a porno theater 
i think we were met at the door by a flippant and arrogant 
doorman jeff stolzer said in court they just looked you over 
like you were scum 
municipal court commissioner diana wheatley said she would issue 
a ruling later 
sammy chao president of the company that owns the mayan denied 
any discrimination and argued that doormen pick and choose who to 
let in to keep out troublemakers he denied there was a dress code 
kenneth lipton 36 a personal injury lawyer specializing in dog 
bites tess dubrall 34 an accounting manager stephen ambrosini 
33 an accountant and stolzer 35 who uns a termite company 
claim a violation of their rights under a state law passed in 1959 
to end discrimination by businesses 
all four waited in vain to get into the club after they 
rendezvoused there may 19 
lipton wore his evidence to court he arrived in the outfit he 
had on that night dark green dungarees black loafers and a 
seagreen shirt with a black design 
for his part chao wore to court a black italiancut suit with 
a silk print tie and white shirt 
men routinely let into the club wear loose baggy suits with 
shirts buttoned at the collar less is more in terms of hemlines 
for women 
the blackrobed commissioner was mostly interested in the 
mechanics of the entry process which was described as the doorman 
choosing from a crowd gathered behind a semicircular rope 
the places i go you can just walk in wheatley remarked 
obviously this is a more popular spot 
chao said he hires doormen sensitive enough to see through 
a person and screen out the intoxicated or dangerous 
he said there was no discrimination on the basis of race or sex 
but that the number of people let in was limited for safety in 
addition room must be saved for private parties and people with 
reservations chao said 
its not disneyland he said if we run a firstcome 
firstserved we will soon be filled 
outside court lipton outlined a broader purpose halting the 
spread of new yorkstyle club entry policies to california 
we just dont want the policy to come to los angeles and we 
dont want it to expand move to movies bowling alleys it hasnt 
been legal since the 1950s he said

german diplomats are trying to get word to 
thousands of germanamericans who have only 10 days left to reclaim 
land seized decades ago by east germanys communist government 
charged with the task are the 10 german consulates scattered in 
the united states and the german embassy in washington 
the german consulate in chicago has mailed hundreds of letters 
to english and germanlanguage newspapers and radio stations in its 
ninestate region where a large concentration of german 
descendants live 
other consulates such as the one in boston have attempted to 
spread the word by contacting german clubs and organizations 
what we are telling people is that they better claim the 
property as soon as possible said cornelia dautel a german vice 
consul in chicago if they wait until after october 13 they will 
have much legal difficulty trying to reclaim the land 
east germany and west germany were joined wednesday after months 
of negotiations earlier this year east germany passeda law 
permitting people to reclaim land that was seized after the 
communists came to power in 1949 
the chicago consulate has received about 200 telephone calls 
from people who hope to regain property they or their families 
owned before world war ii deputy consul karl schon said 
elisabeth jacoby of the chicago suburb of mount prospect is one 
of them 
a resident of east germany until she was 18 jacoby crossed the 
border into west germany in 1951 she left behind her parents her 
sister and a childless uncle who owned a prominent hotel in 
wolmirstedt a small city 45 miles east of the west german border 
the government converted the hotel into a store in the 1960s 
then tore down the building in 1972 
almost 40 years after their uncles death in 1951 jacoby her 
sister and a cousin who lives in west germany finally have hope of 
reclaiming the land on which the hotel stood 
before the borders came down and everything changed there was 
nothing we could do jacoby said we had given up hope 
the government controls the land which is now being used as a 
parking lot but the women as their uncles only heirs are 
entitled to it under his will jacoby said tuesday 
both my parents worked in that hotel jacoby said we feel 
our family worked very hard for what they had and we should not let 
the east german government have it 
jacobys claim is one of more than 1 million most from west 
german residents that the east german government has received 
since it allowed such claims to be filed 
the claims will be evaluated by the local governments where the 
property is situated those who prove they are entitled to the 
property will be compensated for the land or receive title to the 
property if possible schon said 
its question of proof schon said if a person can 
establish through the real estate register or other records that he 
is entitled to the property then the law says it must be returned 
to him

a cargo door that blew off a united airlines 
jet sweeping nine people to their death has been brought ashore 
for examination by safety investigators after being raised from the 
floor of the pacific 
the navy submarine sea cliff retrieved the final piece of the 
door monday from its resting place 14100 feet down and 90 miles 
south of honolulu 
the submarine and its support ship returned to pearl harbor on 
tuesday 
the discovery ended a needleinahaystack search of the ocean 
floor that began when a sonarscanning submersible found debris 
from the jet in july the threeman submarine recovered the bottom 
half of the door last week 
national transportation safety board officials moved the two 
halves of the door to a hangar at honolulu international airport 
investigators want to know why the door tore away at 22000 feet 
shortly after the boeing 747 took off from honolulu in 1989 for new 
zealand with 355 passengers the crew managed to return the jet to 
honolulu 
after investigators examine the debris parts of it will be sent 
to the boeing co in seattle for a more detailed review under board 
direction said navy spokeswoman sandy stairs 
the ntsb determined that faulty design of a locking mechanism 
probably caused a cockpit light to indicate falsely that the door 
was locked but the agency wants to examine the door to confirm its 
findings and perhaps bring about better safety rules 
the agency blamed united boeing and the federal aviation 
administration for failing to corect problems with the door it 
asked the navy to find the door

two holdup men used a chain saw to cut 
off the left hand of an outofwork migrant farm worker to steal 
his expensive watch and two rings police say 
they did it for the sheer joy of doing it that kind of random 
violence is frightening police chief lane roberts said tuesday 
the victim a 20yearold believed to be from mexico asked that 
his name not be released he was listed in stable condition at 
yakima valley memorial hospital 
investigators said they had no suspects 
the victim a newcomer to the area who speaks little english 
told police through an interpreter he was with his cousin and was 
looking for work 
the two were at a grocery store friday night in this poor yakima 
suburb and were approached by two men who offered to sell them a 
chain saw roberts said 
one of the men pulled a gun and the two victims were forced into 
their own car and driven to a remote area where the holdup men 
tried to remove the victims jewelry roberts said 
the police chief said the mans watch valued at 1500 had a 
special security latch that was difficult to open its not 
something where you reach down with your thumb and pop it loose 
he said 
the victim tried to show the robbers how to remove the watch 
but they apparently saw this as resistance and took the most 
expedient method to get to it roberts said 
he said one man held the victim down and the other used the 
chain saw the robbers then escaped in a vehicle driven by an 
accomplice roberts said 
the victims 39yearold cousin who has been in the united 
states for eight years was not harmed and drove him to the 
hospital the chief said 
when people are there with a chain saw you have to wonder if 
they are not looking for an opportunity to do something bizarre 
he said

as germans poured champagne and exploded 
fireworks to celebrate unification today poles living on europes 
new dividing line looked on with reserve expressing hope fear and 
a little envy 
prior to the celebration german youths shouting progerman 
slogans threw stones at two polish buses picking up factory workers 
across the border in frankfurt an der oder 
precisely at midnight fireworks exploded over the german city 
and the border station commanders saluted the flag of the german 
federal republic earlier the german guards changed out of their 
gray uniforms and into the dark green uniforms of the west german 
units 
in the waning hours of east germanys nationhood shoppers had 
rushed across the bridge spanning the oder which separates slubice 
from frankfurt 
restrictive border regulations were about to take effect at 
midnight and thousands of germans flooded slubice to shop cheaply 
in poland throngs filled sidewalks and lawns turned into parking 
lots for east german cars 
amid the crush of commerce and bargaining in two languages some 
poles paused to voice their anxiety at the prospect of having a 
rich powerful and populous united germany a few steps away 
we cant forget these fears until someday europe becomes 
united look at our history said andrzej macewski the visiting 
engineerturnedstreet trader from lodz recalled the agony of world 
war ii in which 6 million poles died and the long list of 
polishgerman conflicts that preceded it 
some residents of slubice were less concerned 
i wont speak badly about the germans they come here often 
and they are very nice they are our neighbors said 
businesswoman katarzyna taczyniec who owns two clothing shops in 
town 
jacek walentynowicz a polish worker in a german tire factory 
was pessimistic a german and a pole have never been brothers 
the younger generation is not so sure about that replied 
andrzej a 25yearold polish border guard who would not give his 
last name 
he agreed with the new german border commander ultun topp that 
the outer border between eastern and western europe is now the 
oder which is neatly banked by a brick wall on the frankfurt side 
and undulates around low sand bars on the slubice side 
topp said the tighter travel restrictions are needed on the new 
border because we have to control it for all the people in the 
european community but i believe there will come a time when all 
the visas will fall away like with czechoslovakia i hope so 
walentynowicz had come to the border station to learn if he 
would be able to go to work today without the newly required visa 
he was told he would be let across with proof of german 
employment all in all he said he is indifferent to unification 
except that i could lose my job 
some of the poles returning from germany expressed resentment at 
a policy requiring visas for poles visiting what had been east 
germany and berlin 
in the past no visas had been needed for berlin and only an 
invitation for east germany 
the many poles from this region who work in what was east 
germany fear they may now lose their jobs 
the german youths who threw stones at the polish buses shattered 
windows and injured both drivers youths wielding sticks pounded 
two polish cars waiting to cross the border 
to me it seems horrifying said one passenger halina 
gawronska we welcome them with open arms and then this we live 
together how could they 
there was always great friendship but now we dont know what 
is going on said a companion genewa kowalska 
antipolish attitudes spawned in part by aggressive commerce in 
both directions across the river and longheld antagonisms 
the border along the oder and neisse rivers was created after 
world war ii onethird of poland is land forfeited by a defeated 
germany 
some germans have never relinquished claims to the former lands 
during unification talks poland extracted promises from the 
parliaments of both germanys that the border would be made final in 
a treaty between poland and the united germanys new government

gamblers drawn by 1 million jackpots and 
pickup trucks as prizes are trying their luck at south dakotas 
first indian casino the newest hope of prosperity for the 
hardpressed santee sioux tribe 
the casino in the style of las vegas and atlantic city nj 
opened tuesday with slot machines card games and bingo on a dusty 
plot of reservation land surrounded by cornfields outside 
flandreau population 2200 
the town is small but the stakes are high for gamblers as well 
as the sioux who stand to earn 750000 to 1 million in the 
casinos first year 
some of the slot machines offer a jackpot of 1 million others 
offer new ford pickups as top prizes 
the tribe is the first of nine in south dakota to receive state 
permission to open a casino under the national indian gaming act of 
1988 based on a 1987 us supreme court ruling that once a state 
allows any form of gambling indian tribes can offer the same 
games without government restriction 
its cheaper than flying to las vegas and paying for plane 
fare and hotels said sondra feldman who played the slots with 
her husband norm 
i think itll go over good said mrs feldman who lives in 
nearby sioux falls 
jim lewis who developed the casino for the tribe said hell 
make slightly less than the amount he estimates will go to the 
santee sioux each year he also wants to develop a supper club and 
two hotels across from the casino 
the casinos bingo section is hooked to the megabingo network 
that links bingo operations of other tribes the network offers a 
prize of 500000 every night and 1 million on saturdays 
thirtyfive people were in line when the doors opened at 9 am 
by noon lewis estimated 300 people had gone through the casino 
many in the crowd were retirees some people stopped by on their 
lunch breaks a check of license plates in the dirt parking lot 
showed most were from south dakota with some from minnesota 
i think come this weekend we should be seeing 3000 people 
through the doors lewis said 
flandreau is one of only two places where gambling is allowed in 
south dakota which will soon join a regional lottery network with 
neighboring states 
gambling began in 1989 in deadwood the black hills gold rush 
town where wild bill hickok was gunned down in 1876 while playing 
poker since may gambling has brought the town nearly 1000 jobs 
and strained streets parking lots and water and sewer systems 
the state gaming commission has approved gambling licenses for 
at least 50 businesses in deadwood 
casino supporters in flandreau say it will bring muchneeded 
jobs and economic development 
indians are going through tough times in south dakota on nine 
reservations unemployment is about 80 percent and alcoholism 
drugs and poor health are severe south dakota has about 45000 
indians more than 6 percent of its population 
some of the gamblers pouring money into the casinos coffers 
said they wouldnt want one in their hometown 
its not too good for the people said don cover of madison 
it seems the people who cant afford to spend the most money i 
think they can come up with other ways to raise money

the softspoken judge toasted the moment with champagne and was 
cheered by friends after the senate approved his nomination 909

electronic meter that refused to acknowledge his quarters 
ill tell you ive certainly got a lot of witnesses that i 
tried to put money in the meter he joked so if i get a

republican candidates in new jersey are trying 
to capitalize on taxpayer anger by linking their opponents to 
democratic gov jim florio and his 28 billion tax package 
many democrats meanwhile are trying to distance themselves 
from the governor who pushed through the states biggest tax hike 
after just five months in office 
in new jerseys 12th congressional district democrat marguerite 
chandlers radio ads start with an attack on florio instead of her 
gop opponent 
state sen richard a zimmer who also is trying to tap into 
discontent with the states democratic administration responded 
with a reminder that mrs chandler just four months ago 
congratulated the governor for his courage in tackling the budget 
deficit 
his campaign ads warn that mrs chandler could do what florio 
did promise no new taxes and then flipflop once elected 
florio has blamed the states budget woes on former republican 
gov thomas h kean claiming he was forced to break a campaign 
promise against raising major taxes because he didnt know how bad 
things were 
republicans watched their gubernatorial nominee rep james 
courter go down in a landslide last fall now they are predicting 
that florios tax package could revive their prospects for 
recovery 
there is going to be a price to be paid by every democrat who 
ran around new jersey last year calling for the election of jim 
florio as governor of new jersey said robert franks the state 
republican chairman 
democrats concede the issue has caught on to some degree 
will the tax issue have an effect yes its probably going to 
have at least a marginal effect in every race said stephan 
demicco executive director of the new jersey state democratic 
committee 
the question is whether the gop can make the issue stick on 
eection day 
republicans surprisingly have not been able to make a coherent 
argument that democratic candidates for congress should be held 
accountable for the actions of a democratic governor said 
richard roper director of the council on new jersey affairs at 
princeton university 
roper who advised the florio campaign last year said that in 
the us senate race longshot gop challenger christine todd 
whitman has been unable to force democratic incumbent bill bradley 
to speak out about the florio taxes 
we are distancing ourselves from the particulars of the tax 
package because sen bradley had nothing to do with it said nick 
donatiello bradleys campaign manager 
roper said tax anger should influence the race in florios old 
house district where democratic nominee robert andrews is 
perceived as florios chosen successor 
i do think its likely the democratic candidate in south 
jerseys 1st district may suffer as a result of his association 
with the florio organization in camden county roper said 
franks said gop polling has detected resentment against florio 
in his former backyard 
people in his home area feel very much betrayed in terms of 
his rhetoric during the campaign and the product he delivered 
franks said 
democrats also should not discount the power of the grassroots 
antitax movement in the 3rd district along the jersey shore 
franks said 
in that race republican challenger paul kapalko is trying to 
link incumbent democrat frank pallone jr to florio pallone 
however is running as an antitax candidate 
roper foresees no democratic casualties from the gops antitax 
strategy 
the people who are up for reelection on the democratic side 
especially for the us senate are extremely popular and are not 
likely to be painted with the florio tax brush roper says 
but the gop is betting on its antiflorio strategy offering 
local candidates cable tv spots admonishing voters that if they 
want to send florio a message this fall they should vote 
republican

an accountant looking through an old safe at 
a baptist seminary has found a lost manuscript of two famous mozart 
piano works 
i thought gee this couldnt be real these are in an archive 
in the louvre or somewhere in a museum judy dibona said tuesday 
the 14page original manuscript of wolfgang amadeus mozarts 
fantasia in c minor and the sonata in c minor will be 
auctioned nov 21 in london sothebys auction house said it is 
worth between 940000 and 14 million 
the whereabouts of the brownink manuscript had been unknown 
since the 1915 death of its american owner william h doane of 
cincinnati 
found with it were lesser compositions by franz joseph haydn 
johann strauss the elder and others they are expected to fetch a 
total of about 110000 at the same sale 
manfred brauch president of eastern baptist theological 
seminary in philadelphia said the manuscripts had been listed in 
insurance records since 1984 but the insurance company was not 
aware of the potential value he said 
ms dibona accounting manager at the sister eastern college in 
nearby st davids found the mozart manuscript in a vault within a 
vault in july while looking for historical records 
i hummed it and played it with my fingers im a pianist 
she said i cant express the feeling of joy to be the first one 
to touch these manuscripts in years 
doane a composer of hymns and a philanthropist left the 
manuscripts to his widow they were passed to his daughter who in 
1950 donated them with funds to build a chapel and music rooms at 
the seminary brauch said 
scholars have not seen this mozart manuscript since the early 
19th century said stephen roe a sothebys expert on music 
manuscripts it went through several hands and crossed the 
atlantic to doanes collection in 1889 
the two works have been played regularly by great pianists 
since mozars time and he himself performed the fantasia in 
1789 they contain some of his most moving music in the minor 
key roe said 
eugene k wolf professor of music at university of 
pennsylvania was asked to authenticate the manuscript it was 
immediately apparent that this was the lost manuscript he said 
wolf a specialist in 18th century instrumental music said the 
manuscripts were in two manila envelopes that merely said sacred 
music on the outside thats not likely to stir your interest 
the works were written in 1784 and 1785 when mozart was in his 
late 20s they are usually performed together 
wolf said the manuscript has great interest for scholars it 
contains two sets of variations on the main theme one of which has 
never been known before he said it tells us about mozarts 
compositional process 
brauch said the manuscript will be displayed at the seminary 
oct 15 that evening the two works will be be performed at the 
seminary chapel

share prices fell slightly today in tokyo dashing 
hopes that the markets record recovery the day before had signaled 
a turnaround from a ninemonth decline 
meanwhile the dollar closed at 13665 yen down 008 yen from 
tuesdays clos of 13673 yen it opened at 13633 yen and ranged 
between 13621 yen and 13670 yen 
the 225issue nikkei stock average which gained 267655 points 
tuesday in its largest daily gain ever fell 4902 points or 021 
percent ending the day at 2284939 todays trading was moderate 
with 600 million shares changed hands on the first section 
the markets key index closed the morning session 33116 points 
higher but that was the end of an afterglow left by government 
support measures that triggered tuesdays surge traders said they 
said the index lost about 600 points within the first 30 minutes of 
afternoon trading as profit takers dumped issues 
masahiro umemori an analyst with nomura securities co said 
tuesdays rise would not set a new trend although expectations 
about easier monetary policy reassured investors 
i think the market has not hit bottom its going to fall some 
more he said on tuesday many investors were confused by the 
sudden changes in the market and were not quite sure what they 
should be doing 
in the first nine months of this year the market has lost 
1793237 points or 461 percent from last years close at 
3891587 the losses are equivalent to 21 trillion 
the market will continue to seek its bottom for awhile said 
kazu nomura a trader with new japan securities co the markets 
environment is so bad and pessimistic investors have no buying 
incentive 
on monday finance minister ryutaro hashimoto announced a series 
of measures aimed at spurring buying and reducing market 
volatility the measures include easing restrictions on stock 
purchases on credit and shorter hours for futures and options 
trading to stymie speculators hashimoto also mentioned the 
possibility of easing monetary policy temporarily 
some analysts say an easier monetary policy for the sake of 
revitalizing the stock market should be only a temporary measure 
over a longer period a looser monetary policy amid higher oil 
prices and the tight labor market could ignite inflation they say 
nikko securities chief trader yoshio ogawa said the index would 
have risen farther if a computer breakdown had not halted 45 
minutes of morning trading 
quick recovery only in terms of the indexs gains is no good 
the market should digest both buying and selling at the same time 
and rise back little by little ogawa said 
traders said rising oil prices and some positive developments in 
the gulf crisis including a recent release of some french hostages 
from iraq contributed the nikkeis morning increase 
the indexs afternoon plunge was fueled by largescale selling 
by foreign brokerages following a false rumor about fighting in the 
gulf said nomura of new japan securities 
japan is highly vulnerable to unrest in the gulf because it 
imports virtually all its oil with 70 percent of it coming from 
the middle east 
meanwhile an economic forecast released by the research 
institute on the national economy a privately funded think tank 
predicted that stock market declines will inflict only minor 
damages on the japanese economy 
losing a bubble is rather a plus to the japanese economy in 
the long run it said a series of stock market plunges paved 
the way for growth with balance between actual economy and 
financial markets 
on the foreign exchange dealers said falling oil prices 
triggered the dollars slip against the yen earlier today 
lower oil prices helped the yen gain slightly against the dollar 
and the european currencies early today but rumors of fighting in 
the middle east discouraged the yen buying in the afternoon 
session dealers said 
they said investorsavoided major moves ahead of testimony later 
today by us federal reserve chairman alan greenspan and fridays 
release of us jobless rate 
chemical bank dealer minori takeuchi said market players were 
hoping to get clues of the feds policy on interest rates which 
have been widely expected to fall 
in bond dealings the yield of the benchmark no 119 10year 
japanese government bonds closed at 8310 percent up from 
tuesdays 8185percent close their price ended lower at 8232 
points from 8281 
bond dealers said a rumor also false that a us fighter jet 
was shot down in the gulf sent bond prices lower

troops and conventional weapons from the atlantic ocean to the ural

united states the conferences began in 1975 in finland

the animated raisins that danced off the 
vine and into the hearts of american consumers are sitting out the 
next tv commercial yielding the advertising spotlight to a new 
clay character 
the california raisin advisory board and its advertising 
company which since 1986 have used awardwinning will vinton 
productions for memorable claymation television ads said 
tuesday they have chosen a new studio 
there are some slightly different things we wanted to try 
said louise ure vice president of foote cone amp belding an 
advertising studio that handles the boards commercials 
its just that there are other options out there more clay 
animators 
the shadewearing raisins that strutted to i heard it through 
the grapevine and appeared on tshirts and dozens of other 
products will be succeeded by a commercial by sculptoons a san 
francisco studio whose owners are former animators with portland 
orebased will vinton 
the new spots will feature an animated clay version of actor 
carl ballantine who appeared as gruber in the 1960s tv series 
mchales navy said tom gasek coowner of sculptoons 
ballantine will play the raisins manager 
ure said california raisins will appear in the commercials 
which are expected to air next month but he declined to discuss 
details gasek however said the raisins wouldnt be singing or 
dancing 
youll see a raisin phone a raisin lamp things like that 
she said 
will vinton productions which won an academy award in 1975 for 
its first animated short closed monday was disappointed but 
not disturbed by the decision 
we feel kind of strange not doing the new commercial but its 
not hurtful to us we normally do between 20 and 30 commercials for 
various clients so one commercial wont make much of a 
difference said robert phinney vice president another of the 
studios creations is the noid character seen on dominos pizza 
commercials 
he and ure whose company seeks bids from various studios for 
each raisin ad rather than contracting with one firm said their 
companies had a good relationship and hoped to work together again 
will vintons seven dancing raisin commercials enjoyed critical 
and practical success since the clay figures september 1986 debut 
the spots won four clio awards for advertising excellence and 
helped boost sales of raisins a 500 million industry in the 
states central valley over a 3year period ending last year 
us consumption rose nearly 20 percent said linda wood 
spokeswoman for the california raisin advisory board 
california farmers sold more raisins in 1989 than in any other 
year except 1984 when growers dropped the price about 30 percent 
ure said 
it took everyone by surprise she said of the commercials 
success we thought it had great promise but we were absolutely 
astounded by the way the american people embraced the dancing 
raisins 
theres a certain charm to the characters and the music is 
great it is so reminiscent for people of a great time in our 
lives it made people think about raisins a lot more 
the tv spots also spawned dancing raisin tshirts lunch boxes 
beach towels and other products 
you name it we had it we had about 300 items wood said 
the number of raisin products has now dropped to about 10 but 
sales of the fruit itself are holding steady wood said

iraq built its extensive arsenal of chemical 
and biological weapons with the aid of more than 200 western 
companies including more than a dozen in the united states a 
research agency reports 
a report released by the simon wiesenthal center says at least 
207 companies sold iraq chemicals and advanced technology needed to 
produce and deploy toxic agents which could be used against us 
forces in the persian gulf 
sales by us companies were approved by the government but 
those by german companies often were illegal the report said 
we know there is a possibility of a war what we do not know 
is we are fighting against ourselves wiesenthal center founder 
rabbi marvin hier said at a news conference 
if americans are killed the people responsible are not those 
in iraq but those in the west who gave them the technology 
hier said 
because of the third reichs use of poison gas to kill jews and 
others during the holocaust the german government had a particular 
reponsibility to prosecute those involved in illegal sales to iraq 
hier argued 
its not fair to judge todays generation of germans on the 
past he said it is fair to judge the current administration 
on its willingness to sell chemical weapons to saddam hussein 
the 55page report was compiled for the center by middle east 
defense news a parisbased newsletter the wiesenthal center a 
private foundation investigates issues related to the holocaust 
and tracks nazi war criminals 
renate friedmann spokeswoman for the german consulate in los 
angeles said her government was cracking down on companies that 
conducted illegal business with iraq but she said some sales 
involved seemingly innocuous chemicals that did not become lethal 
until combined with other substances 
among the suppliers cited in the centers report was the us 
centers for disease control which sent a deadly virus called west 
nile fever virus to an iraqi scientist not knowing it might be 
used for military purposes 
chuck fallis spokesman for the cdc in atlanta said the center 
sent strains to basrah university in response to a request from an 
iraqi researcher who spent three months in 1985 at the cdcs lab in 
fort collins colo fallis said the center had no indication the 
virus was used for sinister purposes 
the wiesenthal centers report also said that hewlettpackard 
sold computers that were used in rocket development 
hewlettpackard spokeswoman marlene somsak said the company relied 
on the us government for guidance in making equipment sales to 
iraq 
hier urged sharper controls on legal sales of chemicals and 
technology he also said that governments should apply criminal 
penalties to executives of companies that make illegal sales rather 
than simply fine the company 
the report says that iraqi chemical weapons plants are capable 
of producing from 1400 to 2500 tons of lethal agents per year 
iraqs stockpile trails only those maintained by the soviet union 
and the united states the report said 
the document was based on previously published articles 
anonymous sources and two previously unpublished confidential 
reports of the west german government regarding arms sales to iraq 
and libya hier said

asthma deaths once declining have made an 
alarming reversal and have risen steadily in the united states 
with blacks and the poor among those most affected researchers 
say 
the message we got was very clear asthma deaths are 
going up and theyre going up for the youngest of children said 
dr kevin weiss the lead researcher in a study reported in todays 
journal of the american medical association 
the researchers also found that the chicago metropolitan area 
and new york city were leading the deadly trend 
because of asthmas growing severity in inner cities weiss 
said the national institute for allergies and infectious diseases 
soon will announce a major study aimed at understanding the 
diseases severity in urban areas 
researchers could not fully explain the increased death rates 
the suspicions are that its a combination of lower access to 
medical treatment and a worse environment in urban areas weiss 
said in a telephone interview tuesday 
weiss who works at george washington university medical center 
and the national institutes of health and coauthor dr diane k 
wagener of the national center for health statistics wrote that 
previous research tended to blame the increase largely on 
diagnostic changes but they said that explanation alone doesnt 
suffice 
asthma which afflicts an estimated 99 million people in the 
united states affects children blacks and the poor 
disproportionately the researchers wrote 
for example asthma hospitalization rates and mortality are 
more than twice as high among blacks as whites they reported 
the researchers noted that from 1968 almost through the 1970s 
the nations asthma mortality rates declined yet they wrote 
since the late 1970s there has been an alarming reversal it 
seems that rates are increasing faster among younger children aged 
5 to 14 years than among adolescents and young adults aged 15 to 
34 years 
an accompanying editorial called the findings worrisome 
because they come at a time when morbidity and mortality from many 
chronic diseases are decreasing when we think we have a fairly 
sound understanding of asthma and when we believe we have more 
effective drugs for its management 
the asthma death study examined government data on deaths of 
5to 34yearolds from 1968 through 1987 in all 48 states except 
hawaii and alaska and in the district of columbia 
asthma deaths rose steadily from 1978 through 1987 the most 
recent year data were available the 1987 rate was 42 per million 
population while the 1968 level was 40 per million 
the highest mortality rate in 1987 was among nonwhite males 
135 deaths per million and almost five times higher than the level 
for whites of both sexes 
when combined new york city and the sixcounty chicago 
metropolitan area accounted for 211 percent of the asthma deaths 
studied suggesting those areas are driving the us trend in 
rising asthma mortality the researchers wrote 
we dont know why weiss said all we can say now is we 
finally found a place where we can do some deep indepth 
studies 
dr frank speizer of harvard medical school who was not 
involved in the studies blamed the increased hospitalizations of 
blacks on the inadequacy of our healthcare system 
but speizer who is researching respiratory diseases said the 
trend might speak well of doctors who now better realize that 
asthma patients often need hospitalization

it wont fit in a doctors bag but the lowly 
household toilet plunger has proved its medical mettle 
a doctor says a san francisco heart patient was revived twice by 
family members who reached for the plumbers helper 
dr keith g lurie of the university of californiasan francisco 
medical center related the incidents in a letter in todays journal 
of the american medical association 
he said a 65yearold man with severe heart disease collapsed 
while watching television one evening his son poorly trained in 
cardiopulmonary resuscitation tried unsuccessfully to revive the 
man by mouthtomouth resuscitation and chest compression 
lurie said the son then remembered that his mother had 
resuscitated her husband six months earlier with a toilet plunger 
so the son got the plunger and used it to plunge his fathers chest 
for 10 minutes until paramedics arrived 
by that time the patient had begun to move and breathe on his 
own lurie said 
the doctor speculated that the plunger delivered a precordial 
thump just as medical experts would have and served as an 
effective chest compressor 
lurie said the plunging also may have helped draw air into the 
patients lungs 
he said the son suggested that toilet plungers be placed next to 
all beds in the hospitals coronary care unit 
we recommended that he take a basic cpr course but had to 
admit its hard to argue with success lurie wrote

world leaders today showered congratulations on 
the new germany but in europe the continent with a giant new 
power and also long memories signs of anxiety tinged the historic 
day 
we face the future as friends allies and partners prime 
minister margaret thatcher said in a message today to chancellor 
helmut kohl of germany 
but she said in a british television interview this week 
germany will be very dominant in europe so it will be up to the 
rest of us not to allow it to dominate others of us have powerful 
voices 
many european newspapers referred today to world war ii and some 
included german words from the nazi cry of the 30s ein volk ein 
reich ein fuhrer one people one state one leader 
but others focused on the realization of a dream what 
norwegian foreign minister kjell magne bondevik called the end of 
the postwar division of europe 
japan and other asian countries welcomed german unification 
which japanese emperor akihito called a historic turning point in 
ushering in the new world 
in new york us secretary of state james a baker iii ending 
a 35nation meeting tuesday on european cooperation and security 
declared a new era is beginning for germany for europe and 
indeed we hope for the world 
from moscow president mikhail s gorbachev sent kohl 
congratulations tuesday he paid tribute to all those in my 
country and in your country who did not yield to prejudice and 
fears but persistently worked for the future making this peaceful 
and worthy solution of the german issue possible 
and president francois mitterrand of france who like mrs 
thatcher has reservations about german dominance told kohl we 
have come a long way together we are going to continue tell 
those close to you tell all germans of the solidarity of france 
even the worlds current pariah iraq weighed in with a message 
to the friendly germany people 
the foreign ministry in baghdad said germanys postwar division 
was to serve the strategies and selfish interests of the major 
powers the official iraqi news agency reported 
germanys top diplomat in israel heimo richter laid a wreath 
today in memory of the 6 million jews slain in the holocaust and 
assured israel that his reunited country would never reject 
responsibility for its nazi past 
everywhere television coverage of germans celebrating into the 
early hours and singing their national anthem dominated news 
bulletins while newspapers heralded the rebirth of the nation with 
banner headlines 
european editorial comment laced memories of the nazi 
devastation of europe in world war ii with unease about the speed 
of unification and relief that germany is anchored firmly in nato 
and the 12nation european community 
the emergence of a fat selfcentered germany free from the 
military threat from the east is a more potent danger than that of 
the lean and angry nation of the thirties londons conservative 
daily telegraph said in an editorial 
in france the leftist daily liberation said germany united 
is the victory of european reason but it added on oct 3 
1990 forgetting is forbidden neither the memory of auschwitz 
nor that of democratic and peaceful unification should be hidden 
away 
in italy the conservative milan daily il giornale headlined 
its editorial ein volk ein reich ein kohl 
in the netherlands the liberal de volkskrant an amsterdam 
daily wrote that it would be counterproductive to the further 
development of europe already to begin treating germany with 
suspicion 
others dismissed completely the fears of german dominance if 
anything the immediate danger is the opposite one of a germany 
gazing obsessively at its own navel commented londons respected 
financial times 
european royalty sent congratulations i know that the british 
people rejoice with you said queen elizabeth ii 
dutch foreign minister hans van den broek said in a radio 
interview today that germany will have to play a major role in 
ensuring security on the entire european continent 
president mario soares of portugal said i have no fear 
because it unification is made under the aegis of democracy 
and democratic countries are not aggressive

nasa began the countdown today for 
this weekends launch of discovery on a mission officials hope will 
get the shuttle program back in motion and help restore the space 
agencys credibility 
the shuttle is scheduled to lift off at 735 am edt saturday 
with five astronauts and the plutoniumpowered ulysses probe which 
will explore the sun 
the countdown clock started ticking at 330 am 
were looking very smooth at this point nasa test director 
terry willingham said several hours after the countdown began 
everybodys looking forward to a good launch its been a long 
dry spell 
nasa has not launched a shuttle since april because of dangerous 
hydrogen leaks afflicting columbia and atlantis discovery is the 
only shuttle in which hydrogen leaks have not been found and is 
also the last shuttle to have flown 
discoverys cargo on that last flight the hubble space 
telescope proved a public relations disaster for nasa it was not 
until after the 15 billion telescope was in orbit that officials 
learned its primary mirror was flawed 
sending discovery up and safely deploying ulysses will be a 
boost for morale and a boost for nasa said nasa project manager 
willis meeks 
a generator containing 237 pounds of plutonium238 was 
installed tuesday in the probe tucked inside discoverys cargo 
bay ulysses will use electricity generated from the decaying 
plutonium during its fiveyear journey in space 
while hooking up the generator a worker accidentally sheared 
off the head of one of four bolts on a small mechanical device used 
to shift the generator to full power in space engineers decided 
three bolts were enough to secure the device willingham said 
it will be the second time a shuttle has transported plutonium 
the jupiterbound galileo spacecraft contained twice as much when 
it was carried aloft by atlantis last october 
an energy department team of nearly 100 people will be on hand 
to monitor radiation in case an accident 
activists afraid a challengerlike accident would scatter the 
deadly plutonium over florida and result in untold cancer 
fatalities asked a judge on tuesday to halt the launch 
a hearing is scheduled for thursday in washington before us 
district judge oliver gasch who refused to stop last years launch 
with plutonium 
the activists said nasa is downplaying the threat of cancer and 
that the space agencys inability to fix columbias hydrogen leaks 
calls into question its competency 
nasa replied in court papers that it conducts an elaborate and 
exhaustive safety review before a flight space agency officials 
insist the chance of a plutonium release is extremely small and 
would pose little health risk 
nasa tried four times in four months to launch columbia before 
stopping two weeks ago to turn its attention to discovery which 
must lift off by oct 23 or wait 13 months for the planets to be in 
the right alignment again 
ulysses will speed toward jupiter and use the planets gravity 
to be whipped into orbit around the sun the probe will explore the 
suns poles in 1994 and 1995 
the mission is a joint effort of nasa and the european space 
agency which supplied the 250 million satellite nasas share 
estimated at 500 million covers the launch and mission

a human rights group describing malawi as 
despotic and brutally repressive said today that police there 
killed more than 20 protesters in a previously unreported massacre 
the shootings occurred march 18 in lilongwe the southern 
african countrys main city according to the new yorkbased group 
africa watch 
police fired on stonethrowing demonstrators angry at the 
authorities failure to prosecute a businessman who killed one of 
his employees accused of theft according to africa watch 
more than 20 protesters were killed including passersby 
and many were injured said the group it was not immediately 
possible to get confirmation of the incident from sources in 
malawi 
africa watch detailed the deaths in a 116page report entitled 
where silence rules the suppression of dissent in malawi the 
report scheduled for publication oct 10 was obtained today by 
the associated press 
the report examines what africa watch describes as a quarter 
century of human rights abuses under presidentforlife kamuzu 
hastings banda it accuses western governments of ignoring the 
situation for the sake of their own interests in malawi 
malawi has been widely considered a stable western ally but 
africa watch said that stability has been bought at a terrible 
cost of human lives snuffed out or forced to endure years of 
detention without trial 
but whereas totalitarian eastern bloc regimes received regular 
denunciation for human rights abuses bandas malawi receives 
western aid africa watch said 
africa watch claims part of the reason for the wests tolerance 
of malawis government under banda who has ruled the small hilly 
nation since 1964 is because of generally good treatment of 
hundreds of thousands of mozambican refugees who have fled there in 
recent years 
the report lists bandas idiosyncracies and eccentricities 
under banda malawi has instituted laws that impose prison 
sentences on men who wear their hair over their collar or wear 
flared trousers and on women who wear skirts shorter than 
kneelength or pants banda who is estimated to be in his 90s 
favors threepiece suits and homburg hats 
unfortunately these eccentricities have often made banda look 
like a mere comic opera autocrat and masked the deadly seriousness 
of his repressive rule said africa watch 
it accuses his government of regularly arresting people it 
considers a threat under security laws that allow them to be held 
without trial indefinitely among those detained are the nations 
leading poet jack mapanje and the nations sole neurosurgeon 
under banda africa watch said a leading economist and a 
prominent journalist three cabinet members a minister of 
parliament and members of the jehovahs witnesses faith have been 
assassinated 
it said political prisoners regularly are beaten but criminal 
prisoners often die after being stripped naked chained to the 
floor and denied food or given reduced rations 
africa watch called on western nations to pressure malawi to end 
its human rights abuses by tying future military or economic aid to 
the improvement of its human rights record

former prime minister benazir bhutto 
said today that if she wins the election later this month she will 
fight to remove pakistans president who two months ago ousted her 
government 
a spokesman for the armybacked caretaker government accused 
bhutto of trying to create chaos and instability and force 
cancellation of the oct 24 parliamentary election 
ms bhuttos 20monthold elected government was dismissed aug 
6 by president ghulam ishaq khan on charges of corruption and abuse 
of power 
she now faces trial before a special onejudge tribunal in 
lahore and her hometown of karachi on four charges of misconduct 
and abuse of power 
she had been scheduled to appear before the lahore tribunal on 
tuesday but the proceedings were canceled when hundreds of 
emotionally charged supporters stormed and ransacked the courtroom 
after two hours of pandemonium that left dozens of people injured 
the hearing was postponed until oct 9 
ms bhutto speaking at a news conference today claimed that at 
least 250 plainclothes police commandos infiltrated the crowd of 
about 5000 supporters and stirred up the trouble 
i felt i was suffocating i felt as if i was blacking out i 
raised my head for a gasp of air and smelled gas she said 
riot police armed with automatic rifles and steeltipped batons 
however used no force against the crowd and did not fire tear gas 
during the past month the 37yearold former prime minister has 
launched almost daily verbal attacks on ishaq khan a 73yearold 
career bureaucrat who rose to the presidency in august 1988 after a 
decade of military rule ended 
her remarks are a reflection of a state of panic she 
obviously wants to run away from the elections and to plunge the 
country into chaos and instability the spokesman for the 
caretaker government said on condition of anonymity 
ms bhutto accused the president of lying to her saying he 
twice denied aug 6 that he would dismiss her administration 
people have a sense of anger and outrage at what has been done 
she said 
she predicted that her leftleaning pakistan peoples party 
would emerge victorious in the election she said that if she wins 
the president would be compelled resign or she would fight him 
politically and judicially 
i am not living with him and the people are not living with 
him he has to go this mockery has to end she said 
pakistans president is elected for a fiveyear term by the 
national assembly the lawmaking lower house of parliament and the 
four provincial assemblies 
according to the constitution the president can only be removed 
by impeachment by twothirds majority of the national assembly and 
the senate the upper house of parliament 
most pakistanis including some of ms bhuttos most ardent 
supporters doubt that her party will win an outright majority in 
the assembly the senate is overwhelmingly controlled by her 
opponents

a construction company president was acquitted of 
negligence in the death of an employee but federal prosecutors 
said their effort to get tough with employers about workplace 
safety would continue 
michael n pandelena president of the nowdefunct mill road 
contractors inc was found innocent tuesday by a us district 
court jury it was the first prosecution under a federal pilot 
program that began this week in new england to go after workplace 
safety violations 
after a twoday trial the jury decided pandelena should not be 
held criminally responsible for the electrocution of john nixon a 
worker at a north andover construction site in 1985 
nixon 23 was killed when he grabbed a chain connected to a 
backhoe that pandelena drove too close to an electric line 
pandelena charged with willful negligence would have faced up 
to six months in federal prison and a 250000 fine if he had been 
convicted defense attorneys argued that the death was accidental 
john miles regional director of the occupational safety and 
health administration said an experimental program that started on 
the same day as the trial will allow his office to more ssult in civil 
not criminal charges 
in order to convict employers of a crime prosecutors have to prove 
they willfully violated safety regulations 
its very unusual for the case to even have been brought 
said kinney clearly its very difficult to prove these cases 
because the willful standard is hard to get around

germanys leaders today marked the historic 
unification of their mighty new country by assuring the world they 
will work for peace and never forget their responsibility for the 
nazi holocaust 
random violence in nearly a dozen cities marred the unification 
celebrations overnight about 15000 leftists protesting the merger 
rallied this afternoon in berlins workingclass district of 
kreuzberg and numerous shouting matches with police broke out 
the country was less than 12 hours old before the assurances of 
peace came from chancellor helmut kohl and president richard von 
weizsaecker 
kohls message was sent to all governments of the world today a 
spokesman in bonn said von weizsaecker addressing a formal 
unification ceremony in berlin spoke of the historic 
responsibility stemming from the holocaust 
the statements were meant to calm world fears about the new 
germany with 78 million people in the center of europe despite 
repeated german denials many europeans fear the new country will 
supplant the soviet union as a superpower and dominate the 
continent 
our country with its regained national unity will work for 
peace in the world and promote european unity kohls message 
said 
at the same time we stand by our moral and legal 
responsibilities that arise from german history kohl added that 
was a reference to the nazi past and the holocaust which claimed 
the lives of 6 million jews 
at a formal state ceremony in the berlin philharmonic hall von 
weizsaecker said the nazi terror and the war it caused inflicted 
untold serious injustice and suffering on almost all of europe and 
on us we continuously recall the victims 
no one among us will forget that there never would have been a 
separation without the war started by germany under hitler von 
weizsaecker told several hundred invited guests he also called for 
peace and european unity 
the unification came 11 months after the berlin wall fell in a 
peaceful revolt that cast aside communist east german overlords 
at midnight tuesday before berlins battlescarred reichstag 
an estimated 1 million germans from all walks of life joined in an 
emotional chorus of the national anthem to usher in the birth of 
their nation 
germanys imperialist past was recalled by the reichstag the 
old parliament building heavily damaged in the last days of world 
war ii on thursday it will again be host to german lawmakers 
many standing before the reichstag had tears in their eyes 
during the main celebrations 
what for many was only a dream is now becoming reality said 
de maiziere the softspoken musician who led east germany through 
its short democratic life as prime minister 
dozens held aloft torches that shimmered in the dark 
as the end came for east germany and the mighty new country took 
center stage germans were united in thanking soviet president 
mikhail s gorbachev 
the former east german leader lothar de maiziere credited the 
kremlin leader with clearing the way for east germanys peaceful 
revolution by refusing to prop up an antireform system with the 
force of weapons 
that revolution part of the prodemocracy movement that swept 
eastern europe last year set off the sprint to full unification 
kohl praised gorbachev and also thanked the western allies for 
their support 
despite the relief and joy over unification germans face what 
kohl called a a difficult path in combining the strong west 
german economy with the collapsing economy of east germany 
businesses in what was east germany are failing daily with 
predictions of up to 4 million people out of work the former west 
germans are showing greater irritation with their poor cousins from 
the east 
not all germans were pleased by unity however 
in berlin police said about 50 people were arrested for 
fighting or other infractions overnight 
about 70 rightwing extremists in magdeburg 60 miles west of

a close adviser to mikhail s gorbachev headed for iraq today on 
a special middle east mission leaving just hours after secretary 
of state james a baker iii said there was growing world support 
for a military strike against iraq 
president francois mitterrand also flew to the region today he 
will visit the french frigate dupleix on thursday then travel to 
saudi arabia for talks with king fahd and to inspect french forces 
at the red sea port of aanbu 
meanwhile iraq freed nine frenchmen taken hostage in the 
standoff caused by iraqs invasion of kuwait on aug 2 several 
thousand westerners are being held hostage in iraq and kuwait some 
as shields against a possible attack 
the french nationals arrived in jordan on a regularly scheduled 
iraqi airways flight from baghdad and were to be flown to france 
later today 
a leading spanish human rights activist and legislator left 
spain for baghdad today to try to secure the release of 20 
spaniards held by iraq 
mitterrand offered in a speech last week to link an iraqi 
pullout from kuwait to a broader middle east settlement in a 
speech sunday iraqi president saddam hussein suggested france as a 
possible negotiating partner 
also in the middle east today was prime minister toshiki kaifu 
of japan he was to meet iraqi deputy prime minister taha yassin 
ramadan in amman jordan thursday the japanese foreign ministry 
said in tokyo 
kaifu arrived in amman on the second leg of a fivenation tour 
in the middle east he visited egypt on tuesday kaifu is also 
scheduled to tour saudi arabia and oman before returning home 
tuesday 
the soviet news agency tass announced the departure of yevgeny 
primakov former head of the leading soviet think tank on middle 
east issues 
it said he would visit baghdad en route to amman jordan where 
he would meet with king hussein and plo chairman yasser arafat 
tass said primakov was on a special mission on behalf of the 
soviet president but did not elaborate it also did not say with 
whom primakov would meet in baghdad 
the soviets have joined the united states in demanding that 
saddam pull his troops out of kuwait although they have urged that 
no military action be taken against iraq without un 
authorization 
on tuesday the soviet military chief of staff reiterated that 
position during a trip to new york gen mikhail moiseyev said 
current sanctions are working and that saddam is in economic and 
political isolation and he cant survive very long that way 
it appeared however that iraq had no intention of budging in 
the 2monthold persian gulf crisis 
us military sources in saudi arabia said baghdad has 
strengthened its forces in southern iraq and kuwait and has now 
deployed nearly half its 1 millionman army to defend the occupied 
territory 
about 170000 us troops are leading a multinational force 
arrayed against saddam across the border in saudi arabia and on 
ships in the region 
there have been reports from occupied kuwait of atrocities by 
iraqi soldiers of people accused of belonging to the resistance 
being executed and of sympathizers having their homes burned down 
today amnesty international issued a report saying that iraqi 
troops in kuwait have tortured and executed scores of people some 
for refusing to display pictures of saddam the londonbased 
international human rights group said the report was based on 
information gathered by two representatives who interviewed 
witnesses and victims in bahrain 
the european community announced tuesday that it will provide 
15 billion in aid to egypt jordan and turkey as compensation for 
economic hardships they are suffering because of the crisis 
turkey lost substantial revenue with the shutdown of an iraqi 
oil pipeline through its territory jordan is burdened by an influx 
of refugees and egypt with the cost of keeping troops in saudi 
arabia to deter an iraqi attack 
all three say they are honoring the un embargo on trade with 
iraq 
but cyprus has said it arrested three members of a tanker crew 
on suspicion of trying to ship iraqi oil to lebanon the 
honduranflag tanker fiona owned by a lebanese company loaded 
13000 barrels of oil on aug 24 at turkeys southern port of dort 
yol cypriot authorities said tuesday 
that is the mediterranean terminal of an iraqi oil pipeline 
runing across turkey ankara said it had closed the pipeline soon 
after the un embargo was announced the ship arrived in lanarca 
sept 24 after trying and failing to deliver oil to the christian 
lebanese port of jounieh 
in new york on tuesday baker told a news conference that he had 
found a greater willingness to consider military action against 
iraq if it became necessary at an appropriate time 
but he said sentiments could change quickly and emphasized that 
the bush administration preferred a diplomatic solution 
baker has spent the past week in new york consulting with 
diplomats attending the annual un general assembly session 
in a speech to the assembly on monday president bush sounded a 
conciliatory note by suggesting that an iraqi pullout from kuwait 
could be linked to an overall middle east peace settlement that 
would consider the demands of palestinians for a separate homeland 
tass quoted primakov as saying in a newspaper interview that the 
persian gulf crisis was a kind of laboratory testing our efforts 
to create a new world after the end of the cold war 
in the interview with the weekly literary gazette he said 
these efforts should definitely take account of the 
impossibility of imposing ones will on other nations and the right 
of any people to freely choose its own path of development and 
state system 
in los angeles the simon wiesenthal center said iraq built its 
extensive arsenal of chemical and biological weapons with the aid 
of more than 200 western companies including more than a dozen in 
the united states

stefano casiraghi the 30yearold 
husband of princess caroline was killed today when he flipped his 
speedboat while defending his title in a world championship race 
the royal palace said 
caroline 33 was in paris when she learned of the death of 
italian financier husband she quickly left for monaco wearing 
black mourning clothes it was the second tragedy to strike the 
grimaldi family in eight years carolines mother princess grace 
died after a car crash in 1982 
witnesses said casiraghi and copilot patrice innocenti drove 
their catamaran the pinot di pinot straight into a wave at 93 mph 
during a morning run for the world offshore championships 
the 42foot boat flipped over ejecting innocenti but witnesses 
said casiraghi remained strapped to his seat and bore the full 
impact of the vessel slamming into the water 
the twoengine fiveton boat sank with casaraghi aboard 
witnesses said 
he surely didnt have time to look out and at that speed 
stuck under the boat must have been killed by the blow said 
another competitor michel karsten 
emergency crews pulled both men from the water and rushed them 
to princess grace hospital 
the hospital said innocenti the boats driver was being 
treated for his injuries 
weather conditions off saintjeancapferrat between monaco and 
nice were described as normal the accident came 30 minutes after 
the second stage of the race opened today organizers canceled the 
days events but did not say when or if they would be rescheduled 
todays accident is the worst blow to monacos ruling family 
since princess grace the american actress who gave up hollywood to 
marry prince rainier iii died in 1982 carolines younger sister 
princess stephanie also was injured in the car crash 
caroline married casiraghi in a civil ceremony dec 29 1983 
under a portrait of her mother the marriage followed an unhappy 
twoyear union with french playboy philippe junot 
caroline and casiraghi had three children a son andrea 6 
charlotte 4 and pierre 3 
caroline married the tall blond casiraghi after divorcing junot 
but without obtaining a roman catholic church annulment of the 
marriage 
she said she married again because she was in love and knew an 
annulment first sought in 1981 would take a long time 
i wanted a real home and children she was quoted as saying 
it was difficult for my conscience but i was overwhelmed by the 
desire to have children surely that can be understood from a 
christian point of view 
the relatively lowprofile lifestyle caroline had enjoyed since 
marrying casiraghi contrasted sharply with the weekly splash she 
made in celebrity magazines during the 1970s 
the couple were reported to have a close relationship and 
divided their time between monaco and casiraghis home outside 
milan italy 
the funloving but steady casiraghi ran a successful real estate 
firm in milan as well as a retail export business his father made 
his fortune in heating and air conditioning equipment 
casiraghi studied economics at the university of bocconi in 
milan but dropped out before getting his degree 
the financier had a passion for offshore racing competing since 
1984 he won 12 of 80 races including last years world 
championship held off atlantic city nj 
the grimaldi family has ruled monaco since the 13th century 
the area is about the size of new york citys central park 
rainier and grace had three children caroline prince albert and 
stephanie only caroline has married and had children

after years of arming opposite sides in 
angolas civil war the united states and the soviet union may send 
peacekeeping forces to that country once a ceasefire is reached 
the leader of angolas rebel forces says 
but a state department official said today he sees virtually no 
possibility that american forces will be sent to angola on such a 
mission 
jonas savimbi head of the usbacked unita rebel group said 
tuesday after a meeting with president bush that bush sees the idea 
as a good thing 
there was no immediate white house comment on savimbis 
statement last week soviet and american representatives were on 
hand in lisbon for the fourth round of peace talks between envoys 
of the leftist angolan government and unita 
a state department official who was unaware of the discussion at 
the white house said tuesday there was no mention at the lisbon 
talks of soviet and american forces monitoring an angolan 
ceasefire 
the official who spoke on condition of anonymity said there 
was a discussion of us and soviet participation at the diplomatic 
level in overseeing implementation of a ceasefire and a political 
settlement 
another official confirmed today that us participation almost 
certainly would be limited to a diplomatic as opposed to military 
role 
meeting with reporters outside the white house savimbi said 
peace talks with the angolan government are going well 
we think its just a matter of more rounds of talks and then 
we may get there he said savimbi said sunday he believes a 
truce can be reached by the end of the year and that free and fair 
elections are possible by the end of 1991 
savimbi told bush the angolan government has been flexible 
because of us assistance to unita the president replied that 
unita can count on us aid until a ceasefire is in place and 
there is a date certain for free and fair elections according to 
informed sources who asked not to be identified 
presidential spokesman marlin fitzwater said bush believes that 
continued us support is the key to pushing negotiations to a 
successful conclusion 
the president expressed the hope that these negotiations will 
lead to peace and national reconciliation in angola fitzwater 
said 
randall robinson head of transafrica a liberal lobbying group 
that has long opposed savimbi told a news conference that aid 
should be suspended immediately as a means of hastening a 
ceasefire 
only with a ceasefire robinson said can food supplies reach 
the 2 million angolans who he said are suffering from hunger 
angolan authorities agreed two weeks ago to a un plan for 
delivering emergency food aid to angolans who have been affected by 
a prolonged drought 
robinson also said that in addition to cutting off aid bush 
should not even be meeting with savimbi he cited recent news 
accounts that the rebel leader has run his organization with an 
iron fist dealing ruthlessly with wouldbe rivals 
the state department said monday that an account critical of 
savimbis internal rule was based on old allegations which have 
never been substantiated 
jesse jackson renewed his criticism of aid to unita on tuesday 
savimbi is here for his paycheck jackson said in a statement 
he said the policy of aiding unita was begun during the cold 
war which is now over nonetheless us policy has not changed 
jackson said adding we need a new africa policy

a federal judge today temporarily 
barred a school district from permitting a fifthgrade teacher to 
read bible stories to her pupils 
us district judge john h moore ii gave the order in the form 
of a preliminary injunction against the nassau county school board 
and martha mitchell moore said he would rule later on whether the 
order would be made permanent 
mrs mitchell reads the bible each morning to her pupils at emma 
love elementary school in fernandina beach a florida coast town of 
7200 about 25 miles north of here she argues it is legal because 
public schools are allowed to study the bible as a literary work 
the injunction was requested by the american civil liberties 
union on behalf of donald and louise hatch whose daughter is one 
of mrs mitchells pupils 
pressed by dozens of residents who favor bible reading in the 
schools the school baord last week voted to allow mrs mitchell to 
keep reading it in class the board took the action against the 
advice of its own attorney 
the 52yearold mrs mitchell a methodist said she read bible 
stories to her schoolchildren throughout her 30year career she 
said it quiets them before class and she never imagined shed be 
violating the constitution 
because you were able to teach it the bible in schools as a 
piece of literature if i didnt make any interpretation on it or 
try to smother the children to me it was not legally wrong she 
said 
the lawsuit alleges that the teacher and school board have 
violated the establishment and free exercise clauses of the us 
constitution 
the hatches said they have no personal objection to mrs 
mitchell or her teaching methods but dont believe their 9yearold 
daughter should be read the bible in school 
robyn blumner executive director of the aclu of florida said 
it is wellsettled law that school personnel may not involve 
students in religious activities tolerance of religious pluralism 
is fundamental to a free society 
by allowing bible stories and bible reading the school district 
is placing its stamp of approval on one set of religious beliefs to 
the exclusion of others she said 
it is simply not the role of the government to indoctrinate 
and proselytize maybe in iran it is ok but not in america she 
said 
moore said he would set a date later for a hearing on a 
permanent order sought by the aclu

california is well prepared to deal with major 
earthquakes but some other quakevulnerable areas are failing to 
come to grips with the threat a federal emergency official said 
today 
earthquakes are not just a california issue grant c 
peterson associate director of the federal emergency management 
agency told reporters as he assessed the lessons of the loma 
prieta earthquake that struck northern california including san 
francisco last oct 17 
peterson said 36 states are vulnerable and 17 have major 
vulnerability to earthquakes 
he mentioned the puget sound area of washington state puerto 
rico new york city boston salt lake city denver montana and 
the seven states that could be affected by an earthquake along the 
new madrid fault that runs from arkansas to southern illinois 
the preparedness between california and other states varies 
drastically he said 
california is easily the best prepared state to deal with 
earthquake disasters peterson said in california they have 
had good building requirements in their codes for a long time at 
the local level for new structures some other areas in the united 
states havent even addressed it 
we are trying to sensitize all of the earthquakeprone areas 
to their threat the official said 
the loma prieta earthquake measuring 71 in magnitude on the 
richter scale killed 67 people left an estimated 1000 people 
homeless and did an estimated 7 billion to 10 billion worth of 
damage 
peterson said federal expenditures to assist recovery from the 
earthquake are expected to total 14 billion and will probably 
continue for about another three years 
he said femas experience in the california quake showed a need 
for improved urban search and rescue techniques and streamlined 
registration procedures for victims 
he said an 800 telephone number used for the first time in the 
california quake would be made available to victims in all 
disasters from now on

president bush is sounding the death knell for 
reaganomics as he takes his 500 billion deficitreduction plan to 
the nation conservative economic philosophy ran out of gas in 
congress he complains 
bush who earlier in the week called on saddam hussein to do a 
180 and pull out of kuwait is completing a 180degree turn of 
his own 
or maybe its a 360 it was bush after all who initially 
denounced reagans advocacy of large tax cuts as voodoo 
economics 
bush now is headed for the campaign trail to push a budget 
deficit package whose most outspoken critics are republicans 
the new package has so little support among conservatives in 
fact that bush had to take to the airwaves tuesday night in an 
address to the nation largely designed to pick up gop votes in 
congress 
bushs conversion and embrace of a package that includes 134 
billion in new taxes over five years ends 10 years of supplyside 
doctrine from the oval office the argument that any new taxes are 
a drag on economic growth 
if taxes could be kept low enough the reasoning went the 
entire economy would prosper and grow generating enough new 
business revenue to pull down the federal deficit 
in 1981 when reagan and bush took office the deficit was 789 
billion 
in the fiscal year that ended sunday the deficit was 219 
billion this fiscal year even with the deficitreduction package 
bush is pushing it will be an estimated 254 billion 
if we fail to enact this agreement our economy will falter 
markets may tumble and recession will follow bush told the 
nation in his televised speech tuesday night from the oval office 
he noted that while im not and i know youre not a fan of 
tax increases if there must be new taxes everyone who can 
should contribute something 
bush was to push the package worked out with congressional 
leaders in a series of gop campaign events over the next few 
weeks 
but with the white house claiming it did not appear to have the 
votes in the house to win passage of the package bush today 
canceled plans to campaign in new england on thursday and friday 
the packages proposal for a new 2centagallon tax on heating 
oil is particularly unpopular there 
the new england economy after being the strongest during the 
reagan years now is one of the nations shakiest 
of the six new england states the democratic governors of 
vermont massachusetts and connecticut all opted not to seek 
reelection and the republican governors of maine and rhode island 
are running behind their democratic challengers in the polls 
in comments remarkable for an incumbent president bush told a 
group of business leaders on tuesday the philosophy i was 
elected on runs out of gas in terms of votes in the united states 
congress 
he made the comments by way of apology for giving up first on 
his no new taxes pledge and then on his vow to seek a lower 
capital gains tax 
he still believes in conservative economic theory he said but 
he just wasnt able to translate his views into votes 
weve tried hard and weve simply failed because the votes 
arent there bush said 
bush was asked at a news conference monday what his advocacy for 
the new budget plan said about such campaign promises as no new 
taxes and a cut in the capital gains tax rate 
it says you need more republicans and then well do it 
exactly my way he responded 
he told the business leaders tuesday every once in a while in 
ones presidency i think it dawns on the incumbent of the oval 
office that youre not going to get it exactly your own way 
i dont want to sound sanctimonious about this but i was 
elected to govern i was elected to make things happen he added

the supreme court wrestling with the 
constitutionality of skyrocketing punitive damage awards in 
lawsuits heard sharply conflicting views today in a case of 
potentially enormous importance to american consumers and 
businesses 
bruce j ennis jr urging the justices to uphold a 1 million 
jury award in an alabama insurance fraud case said 200 years of 
legal history are on his side 
the jury just has to have a rational basis and not be 
arbitrary he said that has been the practice throughout the 
land for 200 years and it is still the standard in nearly every 
state today 
but his opponent bruce a beckman argued for placing stricter 
limits on the discretion of jurors 
in the alabama case beckman said all the jury had to go on 
was its own notions of right and wrong that is exactly the 
arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement the constitution 
condemns 
ennis is representing a woman who won the 1 million award 
beckman is the lawyer for the insurance company 
the justices peppered both sides with questions giving few 
clues to the outcome of the complex case it hinges on the 
application of the constitutions due process guarantee 
essentially an assurance of fair play for all 
justice antonin scalia noted that punitive damage awards have a 
long tradition 
who whispers in my ear its a violation of due process when 
its been going on since 1791 he asked beckman 
justice sandra day oconnor in questioning ennis said she is 
troubled when juries impose big awards without guidelines 
giving juries limitless discretion is a very strange notion of 
what due process means she said 
leading business groups the american medical association and 
pharmaceutical industry religious officials and media giants are 
among those urging the court to restrain or outlaw 
multimilliondollar damage awards 
their opponents include consumer organizations and important 
segments of the nations legal establishment 
scores of groups have inundated the court with stacks of 
friendofthecourt legal briefs recalling the intense state 
legislative lobbying over tort reform by both sides in recent 
years 
the court is being asked to decide whether awards aimed at 
punishing wrongdoers and deterring future misconduct may be so 
large in some cases that they are fundamentally unfair a ruling is 
expected in 1991 
david h souter was confirmed by the senate on tuesday to the 
high court but was not hearing the case today because he will not 
be sworn in until oct 9 
business executives say runaway juries swayed by concern for 
injured victims unfairly punish corporations because of their size 
and wealth but consumer advocates say such uncertainty is the best 
protection americans have against corporate greed 
in the alabama case the pacific mutual life insurance co was 
ordered to pay 1040000 to cleopatra haslip 
an employee of roosevelt city ala she discovered her 
insurance coverage had lapsed after incurring 3500 in hospital 
and medical bills in 1982 for treatment of a kidney infection 
the hospital demanded 600 before it would dscharge her her 
doctor turned her case over to a collection agency and her credit 
suffered from her inability to pay bills that amounted to about 
half her annual pay 
lemmie ruffin the insurance agent who arranged health coverage 
for roosevelt city workers had pocketed the premiums 
pacific mutual said it had not sanctioned nor was even aware of 
the agents misdeeds 
in its appeal to the high court the company said the jury based 
the damage award on moral discretion without adequate standards 
as to the amount necessary to punish and deter the company said 
its rights were violated because it was held vicariously liable for 
ruffins wrongdoing 
the justices last year ruled that huge awards in civil lawsuits 
do not violate the constitutions ban on excessive fines but they 
left open the possibility that awards may be so disproportionate to 
actual harm suffered that they violate due process rights 
the constitution says states may not deprive anyone of property 
without due process of law 
those pressing for limits on bigmoney awards say they squelch 
american competitiveness and the inherently riskfilled development 
of new products particularly medical breakthroughs 
religious leaders want protection against suits charging clergy 
malpractice or indoctrination by outofthemainstream religious 
groups 
media organizations say enormous libel awards such as a recent 
315 million judgment against the philadelphia inquirer are a 
growing threat to free expression 
some states have restricted punitive damages including dollar 
limits or stricter standards of proof before a jury can award them 
but in most states some experts say the trend toward 
multimilliondollar awards has not been checked 
the opposing sides disagree about the nature or even existence 
of a lawsuit crisis 
insurance companies and businesses cite studies that show damage 
awards have gone through the roof with the average judgment in the 
millions 
trial lawyers and consumer groups say the figures are 
misleading they say the sixfigure award is rare with damages in 
most cases only a fraction of the highly publicized big awards 
on tuesday the supreme court heard arguments over whether 
louisiana officials should be barred from giving a mass murderer 
mindaltering drugs to restore his sanity so he can be executed 
its fundamentally wrong baton rouge la lawyer keith 
nordyke argued in behalf of michael owen perry who was convicted 
of killing his parents and five other relatives in 1983 
the medications dont cure mr perry they may mask his 
insanity for a period of time so we can feel better about executing 
him nordyke contended 
but rene salomon an assistant state attorney general said the 
powerful drugs being given to perry are beneficial and that 
louisiana has a strong interest in seeing perry cured

ousted federal judge alcee hastings 
lost a democratic runoff for secretary of state to former 
newspaperman jim minter who faces republican incumbent jim smith 
in the nov 6 election 
hastings 54 was floridas first black federal judge when 
appointed in 1979 the us senate removed him from the bench last

things i believe in 
unofficial returns gave minter 296777 votes or 67 percent to 
144806 votes or 33 percent for hastings the runoff for the

president bush celebrated germanys 
reunification from afar today with a call to chancellor helmut kohl 
and a rose garden ceremony 
no wall can ever crush a nations soulthis ismy message to 
the german people bush said as he signed a proclamation at the 
ceremony making today germanamerican day 
bush said he earlier called kohl to congratulate him 
saying he had caught some of the reunification festivities in 
berlin on television bush said i was very movedand i just 
felt i had to call him on this very special day 
bush said that the moment has come because americans stood by 
berlin 
in asking for senate ratification of the treaty ending the 
division of germany bush recalled the nations nazi past but said 
the germans had shown their commitment to democracy for more than 
40 years he added that the germans have not forgotten the past 
or the role germany once played in the horrors of 193345 
the senate could act on the treaty as soon as today 
but even though bush demonstrated anew his strong support of 
german unity some other american political leaders and experts 
admit to a little unease 
sen rudy boschwitz rminn who was born in berlin and fled 
nazi germany with his parents at age 2 was among the most 
forthright about his reservations 
we will have to watch germany boschwitz told the senate 
foreign relations committee a few hours before unification took 
effect today he said he supported the treaty but couldnt forget 
the past 
germany is germany from the standpoint of its history and i 
think we need to have some recognition of that fact he said i 
have a mixed emotion about seeing it get back together again 
hopefully the feelings and mentality of the people have changed 
boschwitz said germany will be the dominant force in europe and 
is already a leading world economic power 
sen claiborne pell dri chairman of the foreign relations 
committee said he shared boschwitzs concerns 
i agree with him that we should all keep our eye on how things 
progress in germany said pell whose father herbert c pell 
helped prepare the nazi war crimes trials in nuremberg after world 
war ii 
lessons have to be drawn from history said elan steinberg 
executive director of the world jewish congress we have to 
examine why germany was divided in the first place its important 
that germany learn about the holocaust and teach its young 
sen joseph biden ddel noted that germanys commitment to 
cut its armed forces in half was not binding under international 
law the state department said however that it regards the german 
leaders pledge to a limit of 370000 as politically binding 
im willing to throw my eggs in the basket that it will occur 
but i dont think we should kid the american public or anyone 
else biden said 
some members of congress have criticized west germanys 
willingness to contribute money but not troops to making iraq 
withdraw from occupied kuwait 
west german political leaders assert that their governments 
basic law adopted at the behest of the united states and other 
world war ii victors prevents them from sending armed forces 
abroad 
major german parties agreed recently that this provision should 
be changed to allow germans to participate in un peacekeeping 
operations 
angela stent a professor of government at georgetown 
university said a united germany poses no military threat to the 
rest of europe but that it may become more assertive politically 
because of its economic strength 
dan hamilton of the carnegie endowment for international peace 
said germany has become a major force in europe partly because of 
its willingness to act in concert with neighboring countries 
despite its enhanced weight in the world its not a 
superpower it is a power that exercises influence through and with 
others hamilton said 
economists meanwhile are concerned that reunification could 
help push up interest rates in the united states at a time when the 
bush administration wants to hold them down so as to stimulate 
business and create more jobs to avert a recession 
c michael ano director of economic studies at the council on 
foreign relations said east germany and other parts of eastern 
europe will be soaking up money from west germany that otherwise 
might help finance us deficits

the house today approved a major immigration 
bill designed to bring in skilled workers and unite families 
brushing aside administration concern that it could produce an 
overflow of newcomers 
the bill approved 231192 would increase immigration by an 
estimated 235000 a year a conference committee will now try to 
resolve differences between the measure and a more modest senate 
version 
this will preserve our heritage of getting the best and the 
brightest from around the world and do it in a way that improves 
rather than threatens our economic security rep bruce morrison 
dconn said 
the bill would ease obstacles to reunification of families and 
end 25yearold barriers against wouldbe immigrants from northern 
european countries and others that traditionally sent people here 
the measure also would increase the number of highly skilled and 
otherwise needed foreignborn workers permitted to enter the united 
states 
the measure is advancing in defiance of a veto threat from the 
administration which says the number of immigrants should be 
limited to 630000 annually the figure in the senate version 
however the senate limit could be exceeded under certain 
circumstances 
the house would increase the annual influx from the current 
540000 to 775000 and pare down enormous waiting lists of spouses 
and children waiting to reunite their families in the united 
states 
the house on tuesday defeated 266143 a move led by rep lamar 
smith rtexas to cap immigration at 630000 a year it would be 
an absolute ceiling in contrast to the flexible limit in the senate 
bill 
morrison expressed satisfaction after the house defeated the 
cap saying the vote represented the nearest thing to a test vote 
on the bill 
supporters of the limit warned that additional immigrants would 
strain social services at a higher cost to taxpayers 
the fact of the matter is we cant take care of the people we 
have now said rep john bryant dtexas 
however lawmakers opposing the cap said immigrants often are 
among the most highly educated and skilled residents and would not 
strain the system 
rep bill richardson dnm said the reason this bill is 
important is because its good for american business and its good 
for global competitiveness are we going to allow outdated 
assumptions and nativism to hinder our growth 
under the bill immediate families of permanent residents of the 
united states would have the same unrestricted right to enter the 
country as is given to families of us citizens it would raise 
the influx of such individuals from the current 436000 to an 
estimated 520000 
a diversity program also would be created under which the 
government would provide 55000 visas for people from 34 nations 
that were adversely affected when the 1965 law did away with the 
country quota system that governed immigration for decades 
the legislation also would increase from 54000 to 188000 the 
number of employmentbased visas with an eye to bringing in 
skilled workers 
under the measure which is supported by the aflcio employers 
would attest to the labor department that bringing in workers from 
overseas would be the only way to obtain the needed skills the 
measure then provides for a 30day period to challenge that claim 
for the first time the republic of ireland and northern ireland 
would be treated as separate entities for visa purposes doubling 
their claim under the program to compensate countries that were 
hurt by the 1965 law 
the bill would provide 15000 more visas for hong kong employees 
of about 900 american companies doing business in that british 
crown colony the firms say they have suffered a brain drain of 24 
percent of their top employees over the last year because of 
jitters over the approaching transfer of power to china

the crisis in the persian gulf is set to spur 
an economic realignment in asia with important implications for 
businessmen on both sides of the pacific analysts say 
the troubles already have clipped the wings of asias little 
dragons slowing economic growth in the worlds fastest 
developing region financial markets have plummeted throughout east 
asia led by an 80 percent plunge in taiwans main exchange 
but in the long term analysts say iraqs invasion of kuwait 
could mark the beginning of a new era with an emerging vietnam 
improved economic ties between longtime enemies taiwan and china 
and the tapping of siberias natural resources 
the crisis could spark a major change in capital flows 
throughout asia said robert broadfoot a regional economic 
consultant many of them will promote greater stability 
right now however the crisis threatens one east asian country 
with instability the philippines 
philippine president corazon aquinos government already 
reeling from an earthquake in july and coup attempt in december 
suffered another hit with iraqs invasion of kuwait 
it is totally dependent on foreign oil and its factories could 
grind to a halt if energy prices rise add to that the tens of 
thousands of filipinos fleeing home from jobs in the gulf and the 
outlook for unemployment already at 126 percent is even grimmer 
it doesnt take much to stimulate political unrest in the 
philippines said ranjan paul an economist at the hong 
kongbased consultant business international the gulf crisis 
could be the last straw 
four countries in east asia the philippines south korea 
taiwan and hong kong have cut their growth forecasts after the 
iraqi attack 
south koreans have been stocking up on kerosene to heat their 
homes several taiwanese investors have committed suicide in 
thailand also highly dependent on foreign oil bangkoks bourse 
began broadcasting news bulletins to stop rumors from affecting the 
volatile thai stock market 
japan one of the engines of the region has so far churned 
through the crisis without much trouble gasoline prices are up 
only slightly but rising interest rates and a 28 percent slide of 
the already bearish stock market since iraqs aug 2 invasion have 
sparked some concern 
analysts say the immediate beneficiaries of the crisis will 
probably be malaysia indonesia and china the only substantial oil 
exporters in the region 
but their gains could be offset by a decrease in export earnings 
if countries in the west especially the united states suffer a 
recession 
in the long term vietnam and its increasingly marketoriented 
economy are being hailed as a possible winner in the region if the 
crisis continues 
iraqs attack rekindled interest in tapping new sources of oil 
since july vietnam has opened up five concessions for drilling 
rights to its offshore oil fields to western countries 
calls are also rising in the united states to end americas 
15yearold economic boycott of vietnam a bill before the us 
house of representatives would exempt oil and gas exploration from 
the embargo 
the return of vietnam to the international community could be 
a byproduct of this mess said samuel moon of the hong kong 
american chamber of commerce were hoping the us government 
will allow us to do business with them 
analysts also see the gulf crisis as prodding japan to improve 
ties with the soviet union 
the vast untapped natural resources of the soviet far east 
could provide japan with another source of energy timber and 
minerals for decades 
tokyos chilly relations with moscow warmed slightly during the 
september visit to tokyo of soviet foreign minister eduard 
shevardnadze analysts say the longer the crisis in the gulf 
continues the less importance will be placed on japans political 
problems with the soviet union 
some officials think broadfoot and other analysts exaggerate the 
effect the gulf imbroglio could have on japansoviet relations 
that is really looking for a silver lining on a dark cloud 
said robert c fauver deputy assistant secretary of state for east 
asian affairs in a telephone interview from washington he said he 
foresees little change in tokyomoscow ties 
a final offshoot of the gulf trouble could be closer economic 
ties between china and taiwan technically at war since 1949 when 
communist forces chased nationalist troops from mainland china 
relations improved between the two after 1979 when chinas 
leader deng xiaoping launched marketoriented economic reforms 
since then taiwanese businessmen have invested millions of dollars 
in china and thousands of taiwanese have traveled there 
more taiwanese investment in china would increase stability in 
asia as the threat of a communist attack to unite the two countries 
recedes into the past

despite adequate supplies of heating oil 
millions of household budgets are expected to be strained this 
winter as energy prices soar and government assistance programs are 
unable to keep pace 
were going back into the food or fuel problem of the early 
70s for lowincome and senior citizens predicts edwin 
rothschild an energy specialist at citizen action a consumer and 
environmental group 
sharply higher prices could make the average season heating bill 
of 800 common in much of the northeast closer to 1200 this 
winter government and energy experts predicted 
and federal budget negotiators are adding to the cost spiral 
the new deficitreduction plan being considered by congress adds a 
2cent a gallon energy tax on all refined petroleum products 
except for heating oil beginning in january the jump comes as 
high gasoline prices and a proposed tax on gasoline impose sharply 
higher transportation costs on most households 
federal officials told heating industry representatives and 
state energy officials this week that barring a further flare up 
in the persian gulf there will be more than enough supply of 
heating oil and natural gas this winter stocks are higher than any 
time in recent years and many customers already have topped off 
their tanks 
right now were in the best supply position for heating oil 
weve been in three years the hope is that prices will go 
down says bernard smith executive director of the new england 
fuel institute which represents heating oil dealers in the region 
the wholesale price of heating oil soared from about 56 cents a 
gallon before iraqs aug 2 invasion of kuwait to 103 a gallon 
last friday although the price dropped a bit this week retailers 
have absorbed some of the increase but consumers still face 
heating bills that are likely to be 50 percent higher than last 
year 
clair jarvis of the american association of retired persons said 
elderly people on fixed incomes may be among the hardest hit and be 
forced to spend their food and medicine money on fuel in the 
long run they will suffer physically said jarvis a retired 
minister from west virginia 
but oil distributors say they also are victims of the oil 
market 
vera haskins vice president of mauger amp co inc a 
philadelphia area distributor said her company so far has passed 
only threefourths of the price increase on to customers 
nevertheless the price has jumped 40 percent since july to 128 a 
gallon 
soaring heating prices also batter low income households at a 
time when the federal government and many states are cutting public 
assistance programs aimed at helping the poor pay for heat 
federal energy subsidies for lowincome families have been 
halved since 1985 to 105 billion for this fiscal year enough to 
cover only one in every four people eligible because they are below 
or near the poverty level 
we think the states should be picking up more of the money 
said janet fox director of the office in the department of health 
and human services that administers the fund 
meanwhile the bush administration wants to phase out another 
federal program that helps lowincome people make their homes more 
energyefficient the program provided 217 million this year but 
the administration wants to cut that to 30 million for this 
winter maintaining states already have money available for such 
programs 
but many state officials said their energy conservation funds 
are shrinking 
the states have either spent or already committed the lions 
share of these funds said jan freeman executive director of the 
state energy office in pennsylvania the money is drying up its 
not available any more 
the answer that the market is working and everything is ok is 
not satisfactory said vermont energy official george sterzinger 
were just concerned about whether people will be able to afford 
something that is a necessity and will become an increasing 
necessity in about a month

here are excerpts from recent editorials in newspapers in the 
united states and abroad 
 
oct 1 
joplin mo globe on the soviet union 
mikhail gorbachev won another victory in his campaign to expand 
his executive powers to deal with the economic crisis threatening 
to disintegrate the soviet union 
in the process of disappearing already is the empire in eastern 
europe over which the kremlin held sway by influence and at times 
direct intervention today moscow is the capital of a nation that 
seems about to break apart under the pressures of ethnic strife 
regional nationalism and deep economic problems 
gorbachev has opened the door to a change in the soviet system 
but he has taken a goslow approach that is not working the 
economy is getting worse the solution is the dismantlement of the 
staterun economy as russian federal president boris yeltsin 
advocates and the freeing of individual initiatives to unleash 
free market forces 
gorbachev may yet be forced to accept that fact

philadelphia daily news on quayle and the middle east 
there were giants in those days lincoln and lee for example 
but they had their pygmies too 
which brings us to j danforth quayle 
youd think the vice president of the united states close to 
the seat of power would have many deep insights to share with us 
thats why we should be interested in his observations about the 
crisis of the moment 
the man a heartbeat from the presidency explained last week 
that despite efforts by iraqi boss saddam hussein to compare a 
possible conflict in the mideast with the vietnam war the two 
cases are not similar 
saudi arabia and iraq are mostly desert quayle pointed out 
while vietnam was mostly jungle

northeast mississippi daily journal tupelo miss on universal 
health insurance 
a blueribbon federal commission has recommended that congress 
pass laws ensuring that every american has health insurance 
coverage but the report of the pepper commission did not call for 
national health insurance or socialized medicine 
the commission also failed to specify how it would pay for the 
estimated 70 billion in extra costs for universal health 
insurance but it laid out a general blueprint that should serve as 
the starting point for achieving the commissions goals 
simple financial arithmetic supports the commissions findings 
more than 30 million americans with no health insurance and others 
with inadequate insurance are pushing health insurance coverage 
nationwide toward a breaking point 
the people without coverage cause health and medical 
institutions to collect their losses from people with insurance 
that sends costs skyrocketing 
it is particularly important to note that the pepper commission 
admits that the financial burden of health care in fact limits 
access to service in other words health care is rationed 
according to the ability or inability of one or more parties to 
pay 
the plan obviously leaves many blanks to be filled in with 
specific proposals but the commission has made a goodfaith effort 
to start productive debate 
the commission makes a strong case based on hard facts the 
congress and the bush administration cannot ignore the issue 
without further weakening our health care coverage and delivery 
systems

argus leader sioux falls sd on fuelefficient cars 
legislation that would require automakers to increase the fuel 
efficiency of new cars suffered a bumpy ride in congress 
logical as the idea of improved standards sounds the proposal 
ran into snags in the senate and is not expected to survive 
this years lawmaking process 
congress should waste no time reviving the idea in 1991 
us news amp world report magazine made a strong case for higher 
fuel standards in a recent editorial calling for an increase in the 
gasoline tax 
back in the 70s when opec put a gun to our heads we started 
to drive smaller cars and detroit rapidly improved its fleets 
efficiency david gergen wrote american cars today get about 
twice as many miles per gallon as the guzzlers of old but with oil 
prices dropping in the 1980s muscle cars came into style and 
detroits progress slowed significantly 
once again there is a gun to the nations head this time 
iraqi leader saddam hussein poses the threat the iraqi takeover of 
oilrich kuwait has energy ramifications throughout the world for 
the second time in five years the united states has sent military 
forces to the persian gulf 
meanwhile retail gas prices are climbing again some 
analysts predict that if fighting erupts in the mideast prices in 
the united states will rise to 2 a gallon or more 
rising gas prices should be incentive enough for the nation to 
impose higher mileage standards on the auto industry but there are 
other reasons pollution control for one reducing fuel 
consumption could decrease the amount of carbon dioxide cars spew 
into the air 
legislation before the senate would have required automakers to 
increase the average fuel economy of new cars to 35 miles per 
gallon in 1995 and 40 miles per gallon by 2001 
supporters said the requirement upon taking full effect would 
save 28 million barrels of oil a day but transportation secretary 
samuel skinner criticized the legislation as dangerous saying cars 
would have to be built smaller and lighter 
it should be called the highway fatality bill he said 
us automakers have expressed similar objections 
considering that foreign automakers have developed prototypes 
that get 70 miles a gallon and more one cant help but wonder 
about the real motives and interests of opponents of higher mileage 
standards the possibility ofiness comes to mind so does the 
fear of buyers resisting cars that might cost more 
the technology to make cars more fuel efficient without 
sacrificing safety seems to exist congress should force the auto 
industry to act

officials at the gallery that displayed robert 
mapplethorpes photographs thought the exhibit would be exempt from 
obscenity laws but tried to get legal protection before the show 
anyway a board member testified today 
at no time did we consider it obscene said stuart schloss 
legal counsel for the contemporary arts center it was a serious 
artistic exhibit 
he testified that gallery officials thought the artistic merit 
of the exhibit made it exempt from ohios obscenity laws though 
they expected they would get complaints from the public 
schloss said however that the board took the precaution of 
filing a lawsuit before the exhibit asking the hamilton county 
municipal court to rule whether the exhibit was obscene 
the suit intended to forestall any prosecution was never heard 
and was dismissed april 6 the judge ruled the plaintiffs had no 
standing to file such a suit 
the following day the exhibit robert mapplethorpe the 
perfect moment began its sevenweek public run here the same 
day a hamilton county grand jury returned misdemeanor indictments 
charging the gallery and its director dennis barrie with 
pandering obscenity and using children in nudityrelated material 
the defense had said that the case might go to the jury later 
today after testimony from barrie 
in other testimony today art critic owen findsen of the 
cincinnati enquirer testified under subpoena from defense lawyers 
he said that based on his 20 years as a cincinnati art critic he 
thought the mapplethorpe exhibit contained artistic merit 
the enquirer had tried to quash the subpoena for findsen at a 
hearing in court tuesday but judge david albanese refused to set 
aside the subpoena 
in testimony tuesday art critic jerry stein of the cincinnati 
post also testified that he thought the mapplethorpe collection had 
artistic merit while an art historian testified that mapplethorpe 
took photographs to show the beautiful and the tortured aspects of 
his life 
robert sobieszek historian and curator at the george eastman 
house photo museum in rochester ny told jurors that the seven 
photos under attack as obscene have as much artistic merit as the 
rest of the 175photo exhibit which included portraits and floral 
arrangements 
the story was of a very full and rich artist who was 
interested in documenting what was beautiful and elegant on the one 
hand and tortured and troubled on the other sobieszek said in 
videotaped testimony played for the jury 
on tuesday prosecutor frank prouty asked sobieszek if 
communities are at the mercy of curators who try to impose 
their view of art 
that would be a very harsh way of saying it sobieszek said 
if convicted barrie could get up to a year in jail and a 2000 
fine the gallery could be fined up to 10000 
mapplethorpe a homosexual began work on the show after he was 
diagnosed with aids he died of the disease in march 1989 at age 
42 
the seven photos show the genitals of two children a man 
urinating in another mans mouth and anal or penile penetration 
with various objects 
beatrix mary nevill of london and claryssa dalrymple of new 
york mothers of the children in the separate photos said in 
depositions that mapplethorpe took the pictures and exhibited them 
with their consent 
it did not occur to me that there could be anything in the 
photograph that would offend anyone ms nevill said of her 
daughters photo i think it is a very charming photograph 
the us supreme courts test of obscenity is whether the 
dominant theme of the artwork appeals to prurient interest whether 
the work is offensive based on community standards and whether it 
lacks serious artistic or political value 
defense attorneys noted the exhibit drew 80000 people in 
cincinnati wich they say indicates the photographs meet community 
standards

rising oil prices from the persian gulf crisis 
helped push up the value of orders to factories for manufactured 
goods 18 percent in august the government reported wednesday 
analysts said the oilinflated boost disguised the weakness in the 
industrial sector 
to me the number excluding petroleum is consistent with our 
view that the economy is sliding and slipping into a recession 
said sung won sohn chief economist with the norwest corp in 
minneapolis 
it continues to show the industrial sector is going nowhere 
and may be sinking a little bit added bruce steinberg senior 
economist with merrill lynch capital markets in new york theres 
nothing in the report to say were not having a recession 
the commerce department said orders for both durable and 
nondurable goods totaled a seasonally adjusted 2446 billion but 
added that most of the increase is attributed to the petroleum 
refining industry which had substantial price increases during the 
month excluding petroleum orders increased 06 percent 
sohn said energy prices went up even more dramatically in 
september and orders then will be even more exaggerated he 
suggested the reports should be examined excluding petroleum costs 
and my expectation is that orders will continue to soften 
overall nondurable goods orders which include petroleum 
advanced 44 percent to 1171 billion in august including a 3 
billion boost in the petroleum and coal category nondurable 
orders had edged up just 02 percent in the month prior to the aug 
2 iraqi invasion of kuwait 
orders for durable goods bigticket items expected to last 
more than three years fell 05 percent to 1275 billion after 
rising 27 percent in july the drop in august orders was a slight 
downward revision from the 08 percent decline first reported last 
week 
the oftenvolatile defense orders also jumped following the 
iraqi invasion up 144 percent to 86 billion after declining 51 
percent a month earlier excluding defense orders were up 14 
percent 
but orders for nondefense capital goods a barometer of 
business plans for expansion and modernization indicated a 
cautious investment attitude orders plunged 102 percent to 358 
billion erasing a 101 percent advance in july 
among durable goods electrical machinery orders were up 29 
percent to 209 billion after rising 15 percent in july 
transportation orders rose 18 percent to 354 billion after a 46 
percent gain a month earlier excluding transportation orders were 
up 18 percent 
within transportation increases in motor vehicles and parts 
and shipbuilding and tanks more than offset a decline in aircraft 
and parts the report said 
registering losses were nonelectrical machinery down 50 
percent to 214 billion following a 35 percent gain and primary 
metals which fell 23 percent to 115 billion after a 27 percent 
rise 
shipments which also were influenced by petroleum rose 34 
percent to 2459 billion excluding petroleum shipments were up 
just 23 percent 
unfilled orders which were not affected by energy declined 
l02 percent to 5187 billion the order backlog has been 
relatively unchanged since may the department said 
inventories edged up 02 percent to 3739 billion but 
excluding petroleum were unchanged from july

jordans queen noor said wednesday her country 
continues to accept oil from iraq despite un sanctions against 
baghdad because a total cutoff in supplies would cripple her 
nation 
the americanborn wife of jordans king hussein also appealed 
for economic aid for her country which she said is on the brink of 
financial disaster because of the persian gulf crisis brought on by 
iraqs invasion of kuwait on aug 2 
noor said jordan has reduced its dependence on iraqi oil it 
formerly received 90 percent from iraq and kuwait and is looking 
for new suppliers moreover she said jordanians are not paying 
hard currency for the iraqi oil which is in repayment for iraqs 
past debts to jordan 
jordan supports the un sanctions and condemns iraqs 
occupation of kuwait she said 
sh said iraqi oil shipments to jordan must be viewed in the 
proper context of jordans tight economic straits the crisis 
has dealt us an economic blow she said 
in addition jordan has sent some humanitarian supplies food 
and medical equipment to iraq as allowed by the un security 
council 
in a wideranging questionandanswer session at the brookings 
institute the 39yearold noor who grew up in the nations 
capital said she sought to clear up any misunderstandings about 
jordans position on the gulf crisis and draw attention to the 
economic problems brought by the situation 
some western diplomats contend jordan has not done enough to 
help cripple iraqi president saddam hussein and saudi officials 
have chided king hussein for what they say is a failure to condemn 
iraq with enough force 
jordan expects to lose 41 billion as a result of the sanctions 
against iraq its neighbor and formerly its most active trading 
partner noor said 
the countrys gross domestic product may fall 50 million this 
year in part because some 350000 jordanians have returned to 
their homeland where unemployment has doubled their remittances 
have dried up 
noor said the international community has pledged help but the 
country has yet received not much more than promises jordanian 
officials have said if the international community wants jordan to 
strictly observe economic sanctions it must provide aid 
coupled with the economic crisis is the influx of refugees who 
have fled to jordan from kuwait and iraq eighty percent of the 
threequarters of a million evacuees have traveled to jordan 
noor said 
large numbers continue to enter and evidently this problem 
will continue to be with us for some time she said the us 
committee for refugees a private group estimates 564000 have 
fled to jordan from iraq some 32000 remain but the others have 
been repatriated the group said 
noor reiterated her husbands opposition to having foreign 
forces in saudi arabia and other gulf states while jordan condemns 
iraqs invasion of kuwait the annexation is an arab problem 
demanding arab solutions she said 
jordan would be willing to commit military troops to defend the 
region if they were deployed under the banner of the arab league 
she said 
saying she was speaking as a arab noor said her countrymen 
believe the united states and other western nations are applying a 
double standard by refusing the impose the same kind of 
sanctions against israel that have been slapped on iraq 
the un security council has condemned israel for seizing arab 
lands in 1967 but has never enforced sanctions 
she also called for international efforts to prod iraq israel 
and other middle eastern nations to eliminate any chemical and 
nuclear weapons they may possess 
on a personal note noor said the gulf crisis has had 
devastating consequences on her family life nevertheless she 
said she hoped her four children would be able to learn compassion 
and responsiblity from the current situation

heart attack patients who undergo an intestinal 
operation to lower their cholesterol significantly reduce their 
risk of suffering another heart attack or dying from heart disease 
a study shows 
the surgery called a partial ileal bypass reroutes the bowel 
to bypass about onethird of the small intestine this reduces the 
amount of cholesterol that is absorbed into the bloodstream 
dr henry buchwald of the university of minnesota who directed 
the study said this surgery should be consdered as a possible 
treatment for people with high cholesterol who cannot bring it down 
enough by changing what they eat 
an important drawback however is diarrhea which afflicts 
virtually everyone to some degree after having the operation other 
possible side effects include a higher risk of gallstones kidney 
stones and intestinal obstruction 
the study is called the program on the surgical control of the 
hyperlipidemias or high cholesterol it was conducted in 
minneapolis los angeles philadelphia and little rock ark and 
published in thursdays new england journal of medicine 
despite the wide acceptance of cholesterol lowering doubts 
remain about whether it actually helps people live longer if they 
alrhe desert to jordan in search of relief 
only to be trapped in a 100mile long caravan of refugees baking 
in the sun with little help available said sen edward m 
kennedy who presided at the hearing 
eagleburger said the people who left iraq and kuwait impose a 
severe burden on such countries as jordan and turkey he 
acknowledged that conditions in some camps were hard at first but 
said there had been no deaths from starvation or epidemic 
in jordan the worst camps have been closed and the residents 
have been moved to new camps with adequate sanitation and 
shelter he said 
in turkey the only victims of hunger and disease are newly 
arrived displaced persons who developed their conditions while 
still in iraq 
he added that the most critical element in the emergency may be 
the effort to get people back home the largest number of these are 
egyptians he said but gave no further breakdown by nationality

ilse mueller on wednesday gently placed 
a little red candle next to leipzigs st nicholas church 
considered by many the birthplace of east germanys quiet 
revolution 
this is to remember all the people persecuted during those 40 
years ms mueller said of four decades of communist oppression 
the gritty industrial city was the cradle of east germanys 
peaceful popular revolt last fall that later swelled into the drive 
for unification 
to celebrate the merger wednesday thousands of its residents 
shopped and drank as the heart of the city was turned into a huge 
openair market western business people cashed in on the official 
holiday by trucking in stalls that offered everything from leather 
jackets to candy 
but it was a time for reflection as well especially for tens of 
thousands in leipzig who helped free their country by going to the 
streets to demand an end to totalitarianism 
those weekly monday marches began at the lutheran church and 
then spread along downtown streets to the headquarters of the 
oncefeared secret police demonstrators chanted we are the 
people a phrase that quickly became a nationwide motto for 
prodemocracy groups 
the day of reckoning came oct 9 1989 almost exactly one year 
ago 
news reports at the time said communist leader erich honecker 
was considering ordering troops to shoot at the more than 70000 
demonstrators that night hoping to end the prodemocracy movement 
the whole city was tense the hospitals even had extra blood 
brought in case there was a disaster said sven hornig 25 one 
of the marchers who gathered at the church that night 
miraculously there was no bloodshed 
leipzig dignitaries including famed conductor kurt masur and 
local party officials intervened to prevent violence breaking the 
authoritarian hold of honeckers government 
honecker was ousted from power nine days later 
since then st nicholas church has become something of a 
shrine 
on wednesday hundreds of tourists and residents milled around 
on the cobblestone square where the old church stands 
i marched on oct 9 said one drunken leipziger trying to 
keep his balance on a bar stool on sachsen square 
for 10 marks i will tell you all about it 
like many leipzigers he was proud of his role in changing 
german history but the solidarity that brought that change is 
gone many leftists and artists in leipzig oppose the dissolution 
of east germany saying the nation could have been salvaged as a 
new democracy 
more conservatives germans say unity was the only answer 
at the time last fall we were all limiting our demands to 
democracy because no one knew how bad the economy was hornig 
said there would have been a total collapse and chaos without 
unification 
leipzig hopes to take advantage of its role in changing germany 
to become one of europes most important cultural and trade 
centers it already has impressive musical and stage offerings and 
an annual trade fair 
but many of the citys buildings are nearly in ruins after 40 
years of communist neglect rightwing extremism is rising in 
tandem with joblessness and despair among many leipzig youths 
after church bells pealed german unity at midnight tuesday 
about 100 masked neonazis demolished cars smashed windows with 
clubs and fought with police six people were injured and many of 
the radicals were arrested 
the unrest in leipzig presents a united germany with a new 
challenge to meet the hopeful expectations of those who took to 
the streets to bury east germany

assistant state attorney leslie robson argued that the right to 
free speech is not absolute saying the first amendment does not 
give you the right to say what you want when you want and where 
you want with rights and freedom come responsibility 
as the jurors began deliberating alternate juror sheryl 
salomon who sat through the trial but was not needed on the final 
panel said she would have voted for acquittal 
i was very offended by it especially the lyrics but i have 
to question whether there is not artistic value she said its 
music its still music 
in the final day of testimony tuesday a psychologist testified 
that the groups music may be degrading or humorous but its not 
sexually stimulating 
merry haber a clinical psychologist in miami who has been in 
practice for 25 years testified in freemans defense that she saw 
no evidence rap music aroused prurient interest an essential part 
of the us supreme court definition of obscenity 
i have heard people tell me that they may put music on to 
create a mood a little johnny mathis and a little wine but i 
have never heard anybody say they were turned on by rap music 
ms haber testified 
she said she gave the album to about 15 of her patients to get 
their opinions the women found it degrading and both sexes said 
it was somewhat humorous all deemed it boring rather than sexually 
stimulating she testified 
broward county judge paul backman has told jurors they should 
find the album obscene if it appeals to morbid shameful interest 
in sex and violates the standards of average residents of broward 
county 
the lyrics include graphic descriptions of intercourse and 
sodomy and have been criticized as promoting violence against 
women supporters of the miamibased group say criticism of the 
black rappers smacks of censorship and racism 
another defense witness greg baker music critic from the miami 
weekly new times disagreed that rap music is boring it was 
trendsetting its the biggest revolution in music since rock n 
roll itself he said 
john leland a music critic for new york newsday who is 
considered a leading authority on rap music also testified on 
freemans behalf that rappers were able to make exciting vibrant 
music that really drove people nuts it provokes strong emotional 
reactions from people in the audience

scientists are closing in on the gene that causes 
marfan syndrome an inherited disorder that can make people tall 
and thin and cause fatal heart disease 
an estimated 25000 to 30000 people in the united states have 
marfan syndrome many victims are unusually tall and the disease 
is relatively common among basketball players abraham lincoln was 
also thought to be a victim 
finnish scientists said they believe they have found the general 
location of the gene this is an important step toward pinpointing 
and understanding the precise defect that underlies the condition 
finding the gene should help doctors diagnose the disorder 
before or soon after birth however even with this new 
understanding experts say the prospect of curing marfan syndrome 
is still remote 
for the foreseeable future the discovery of the cause of 
marfan syndrome will be of primarily psychological benefit to 
patients dr reed e pyeritz of johns hopkins hospital in 
baltimore wrote in an editorial published with the study 
the disease can cause a wide variety of symptoms but the most 
serious is weakness of the heart victims may suffer leaky heart 
valves or die of a ruptured aorta 
the latest report was based on a genetic analysis of five 
families with the disease in finland it was conducted by dr leena 
peltonen and colleagues from the national public health institute 
in helsinki and published in thursdays new england journal of 
medicine 
the findings have been widely known in medical circles for 
several months and efforts are under way to see if the same 
genetic pattern shows up in other families with the disease 
the finnish researchers narrowed down the location of the 
defective gene to chromosome 15 one of the strings of genes that 
contain all of the blueprints for making a human 
when they find the defective gene scientists will then be able 
to figure out what it does normally and how it causes disease when 
it malfunctions some experts believe the crucial gene may turn out 
to be one that controls the bodys production of fibrillin this 
protein is a building material of microfibrils the fibers that 
make skin and blood vessels stretch

tax increases and spending cuts in the 1991 
bipartisan budget pact probably wont produce the 500 billion in 
deficit reductions needed over five years the head of the general 
accounting office said wednesday 
comptroller general charles bowsher told a senate panel that the 
deal reached by the administration and congressional negotiators is 
a first step in reducing the deficit but more tax increases will be 
needed in one to three years 
its a start and i think we badly need a start bowsher 
said the budget is out of control and we badly need a plan to 
get started 
bowsher whose gao is an investigative agency of congress said 
the size of the deficit problem had been understated he estimated 
a trillion dollars would be needed over seven years or so 
he spoke before the senate governmental affairs committee at a 
hearing on the administrations response to government management 
failures he was questioned about the budget plan by sen herbert 
kohl dwis 
bowsher said the pressures for deficit cutting imposed by the 
grammrudman balancedbudget law have prompted the administration 
and congress to arrive at unrealistic estimates of future deficits 
even if this plan is enacted he said similar measures would be 
needed again 
id be surprised if you didnt have to do it at least in three 
years and maybe in the next year or two he said 
bowsher and assistant comptroller richard l fogel said the 
federal governments capacity to manage itself is deteriorating 
because of a failure to invest adequately in management systems 
computers and salaries for employees 
as an example he cited the internal revenue service which he 
said is failing to collect 100 billion a year in taxes he said 
less than 1 percent of returns are being audited and that a decline 
in irs capability is one reason for the decline over time of 
corporate tax collections 
he said a good part of that uncollected tax money could be 
obtained if the government used funds to modernize irs computer 
systems 
kohl asked bowsher what message to the american people was 
implicit in the bipartisan budget proposal 
we cant run our shop so we have to go out and get more money 
from you bowsher replied

a record store owner today was 
found guilty of obscenity for selling a record by the controversial 
rap group 2 live crew 
jurors deliberated less than three hours before convicting 
charles freeman on a misdemeanor obscenity charge he was arrested 
by undercover broward county sheriffs deputies june 8 for selling 
the miami rap groups album as nasty as they wanna be in his 
ec records store 
the case went to the jury of five women and one man after final 
arguments this morning 
freeman could get a year in jail and a 1000 fine sentencing 
was set for nov 2 
it doesnt represent my community where ec records is 
freeman who is black shouted as he left the courthouse its 
unfair the jury was all white they dont know where ec records 
is they dont know a goddamned thing about the ghettoforcements from allies 
wolfowitz also elaborated on the fears of us strategists in 
the early days of the deployment about the vulnerability of 
american troops to iraqi tank attack 
we had severe concerns about the ability of iraqi armor to 
penetrate rather quickly he said we didnt have anything on 
the ground to stop iraqi tanks we dont want to ever be in the 
position of saying that again 
the officials asked that congress quickly approve the newest 
sale to saudi arabia and said additional sales to riyadh as well 
as to the united arab emirates and bahrain would be requested 
early next year 
next years saudi package will include f15 fighter planes 
additional patriot antimissile batteries and more tanks and 
antiarmor weapons bartholomew said the administration also is 
considering requsts from bahrain for apache attack helicopters and 
multiplelaunch rocket systems and from the united arab emirates 
for apaches he said 
responding to concerns from supporters of israel on the 
committee wolfowitz noted the administration is prepared to 
quickly transfer two patriot batteries from current us stocks and 
is looking at additional ways to aid israel militarily 
asked by rep lee hamilton dind whether it is us policy to 
retaliate against iraq immediately if it attacks israel 
bartholomew said i dont have any reason to open that up to 
question 
rep tom lantos dcalif raised the possibility that weapons 
sold to saudi arabia could fall into enemy hands if its current 
government ever falls and cited similar past occurrences in iran 
and kuwait 
bartholomew acknowledged that some us weapons that had been 
sold to kuwait now are in the hands of iraqi forces including a 
number of improved hawk antiaircraft missiles tow antitank 
missiles selfpropelled 155millimeter howitzers and ammunition 
and about 16 a4 attack aircraft

the house defying a presidential veto threat 
approved wednesday a dramatic expansion of immigration into this 
country with a stress on bringing in more skilled workers and 
unifying families 
this will make americas economy more competitive while 
protecting american workers rep bruce morrison dconn the 
sponsor said following house approval of the measure 231192 
a conference committee will now try to resolve differences 
between the bill and a senatepassed version 
supporters say the bill would reunify families currently kept 
asunder by immigration law while bringing in skilled workers and 
sharpening us competitiveness in global markets the bush 
administration and other critics say it would open the gates too 
wide and create an overflow 
provisions would reduce long waiting lists of spouses and 
children hoping to reunite with families in america it also would 
lower 25yearold barriers against wouldbe immigrants from 
northern european and other countries once viewed as traditional 
sources of new americans 
the bush administration has been calling for a maximum of 
630000 immigrants a year the limit in the senatepassed bill the 
house version would raise the yearly influx from 540000 to 
775000 
the house on tuesday soundly defeated an effort to impose a hard 
and fast cap of 630000 on annual immigration the senate ceiling 
is flexible and could be exceeded in some cases 
morrison expressed hope that the final product of the conference 
committee would find favor at the white house despite veto threats 
he said lawmakers were in a position to narrow down the 
administrations problems 
he said he expected house and senate conferees to hold their 
first meetings next week at the latest but added they will be 
talking informally this week congress is heading toward 
adjournment at midmonth 
the bill would provide immediate families of permanent residents 
of the united states with the same unrestricted right to enter the 
country as now given to families of us citizens it would 
increase the flow from a current 436000 to an estimated 520000 
the measure also would create a diversity program under 
which the government would provide 55000 visas for people from 34 
nations that were adversely affected when the 1965 law did away 
with the country quota system that governed immigration for 
decades 
the bill would increase from 54000 to 188000 the number of 
employmentbased visas with an eye to bringing in skilled workers 
under the measure which is supported by the aflcio employers 
would attest to the labor department that bringing in workers from 
overseas would be the only way to obtain the needed skills the 
measure then provides for a 30day period to challenge that claim 
under the measure ireland and northern ireland would be treated 
as separate entities for visa purposes doubling their claim under 
the program to compensate countries that were hurt by the 1965 law 
the measure would provide 15000 more visas for hong kong 
employees of about 900 american companies doing business in that 
british crown colony the firms say they have suffered a brain 
drain of 24 percent of their top employees over the last year 
because of jitters over the 1997 transfer of power to china

the drug enforcement administration seized 
more than 1 billion in cash and other assets from drug traffickers 
in the fiscal year that ended sunday agency chief robert c bonner 
said 
reaching the 1 billion mark shows that dea has been quite 
aggressive in stripping drug traffickers of their illgotten gains 
the proceeds of their illegal activities bonner said 
the 1025 billion seized according to preliminary figures for 
fiscal 1990 was far higher than the deas budget of 5487 million 
for that year bonner said it represented a 44 percent increase 
over the 9791 million in assets seized by the dea the previous 
year 
but bonner said in an interview tuesday that the seizures wont 
help defray the federal budget deficit just yet the assets must 
first be forfeited which can take years 
thats something i had to occasionally point out to our local 
law enforcement in los angeles bonner said recalling his years 
as us attorney for the central district of california from 1984 
to 1989 you cant just take this and divide it up at the big 
table 
for example the dea seized 9791 million in assets in fiscal 
1989 but only 2991 million was forfeited that year and much of 
those forfeited assets had been seized in previous years said dea 
spokesman frank shults 
for the fiscal years 1985 through 1989 the dea seized a total 
of 281 billion in assets but only 8652 million was forfeited 
numerous cases still await court action 
about 35 percent of the 1025 billion seized or about 359 
million was cash the remainder was property such as boats 
planes cars and homes shults said 
bonner who replaced john c lawn about seven weeks ago said he 
would continue to stress asset seizures 
as a federal judge before taking over the dea post bonner 
handled the forfeiture of 12 million in cash found with more than 
21 metric tons of cocaine in a los angeles warehouse in september 
1989 
to win an asset forfeiture case he said a person must say 
this money belongs to me and it is not the proceeds of narcotic 
trafficking 
there was 12 million in cash sitting next to 20 tons of 
cocaine he said not surprisingly nobody came in to make a 
claim 
state and local law enforcement agencies that work with the dea 
to break cases eventually share the assets forfeited 
such sharing has amounted to 35 percent of total dea forfeited 
assets during the fiscal years 1985 through 1989 with about 303 
million going to state and local law enforcement agencies said 
william snider the deas forfeiture counsel

leaders of a new germany rushed to assure the 
world wednesday that it would strive for peace in the future and 
would never forget the dark lessons of its nazi past 
as most of the nation savored its first hours of unity and 
sovereignty after nightlong celebrations leftist radicals 
protesting unification rampaged in berlin police fired tear gas 
and water cannons in street battles and about 50 people were 
arrested 
soviet president mikhail gorbachev widely credited with making 
unification possible will visit germany next month a government 
spokemsan said wednesday a heros welcome is expected 
in a message to governments worldwide chancellor helmut kohl 
pledged germany would never again pose the territorial claims that 
marked germany from its initial unification in 1871 to its defeat 
and division in world war ii 
in the future only peace will emanate from german soil 
kohl said 
at the same time we stand by our moral and legal 
responsibilities that arise from german history kohl added that 
was a reference to the nazi past and the holocaust which claimed 
the lives of 6 million jews 
president richard von weizsaecker raised the same themes in his 
speech at the ceremony in berlins philharmonic hall 
the nazi terror and the war it caused inflicted untold serious 
injustice and suffering on almost all of europe and on us he 
said we continuously recall the victims 
among the several hundred invited guests was heinz galinski an 
auschwitz death camp survivor and now the leader of germanys 
jewish community 
no one among us will forget that there never would have been a 
separation without the war started by germany under hitler said 
von weizsaecker whose own father was convicted of two nazi war 
crimes for his role as a foreign ministry official 
von weizsacker said for the first time we germans are not 
creating a point of contention on the european agenda 
members of the renowned berlin philharmonic played works of 
famous german composers including johannes brahms and johann 
sebastian bach 
the rebirth of germany as the greatest economic power in europe 
has worried its neighbors particularly poland onethird of whose 
territory once belonged to germany kohl singled out poland when 
saying that a future germany will make no territorial claims 
against anyone 
kohl however reiterated plans to amend germanys constitution 
to send german troops to the persian gulf he said a united and 
sovereign germany was willing to help un efforts in protecting 
and restoring peace 
although germany has committed 2 billion to the usled 
multinational effort to isolate iraq after iraqi troops invaded 
kuwait washington has urged the germans to do more 
germans say their constitution prevents them from sending troops 
outside nato territory but kohl reaffirmed in his message that he 
will seek an amendment that will make such a move possible 
his message came after germany held a nightlong nationwide 
celebration with fireworks and music 
the nation united at the stroke of midnight when a giant german 
flag was raised in front of the battlescarred reichstag building 
in berlin kohl von weizsaecker and other leaders joined in

president bush staged his own celebration of 
german unification on wednesday congratulating chancellor helmut 
kohl by phone and proclaiming german american day at a rose 
garden ceremony 
today it is the wall that lies in ruins and our eyes open on 
a new world of hope bush told an audience of german americans 
after military bands played national anthems of both the united 
states and germany 
bush called the remnants of the berlin wall a ragged monument 
in brick and barbed wire that serves as proof that no wall can 
ever crush a nations soul and this is my message to the german 
people 
bush said he earlier called kohl to congratulate him 
saying he had seen some of the reunification festivities in 
berlin on television bush said i was very movedand i just 
felt i had to call him on this very special day 
bush had turned down kohls invitation to attend the 
reunification festivities claiming scheduling problems 
bush who earlier sent a taped message to the german people 
praising the unity effort signed a proclamation designating 
wednesday as germanamerican day 
this moment has come because americans stood by the people of 
berlin from the daredevil pilots of the airlift to a young 
president who made his bold declaration before the wall he said 
referring to president kennedys ich bin ein berliner speech 
in asking for senate ratification of the treaty ending the 
division of germany bush last week said the germans had shown 
their commitment to democracy for more than 40 years

thousands of egyptians are traveling to 
kuwait and iraq to bring home relatives or retrieve belongings 
ranging from birth certificates to mink coats 
others hope to resume old jobs or win positions vacated in the 
exodus of workers who fled after iraq invaded kuwait on aug 2 
before they go the egyptians must obtain permits from iraqs 
consulate in cairo the papers called facilitating documents 
rather than visas allow entrance to iraq and its governorate of 
kuwait 
egypt has led arab opposition to the iraqi conquest and 
strongly rejects baghdads annexation of its small neighbor but 
cairo has not prevented egyptians from going to iraq or kuwait 
some of these people are very poor said an official of the 
interior ministry which keeps track of the reverse exodus by 
issuing permits to egyptians who work outside the country 
they have no alternative but to work there they dont care if 
theres a war or not we cant stop them 
on wednesday applicants milled about outside the iraqi 
consulate awaiting their documents 
i want to see if my school is still open said mahmoud a 
mathmetics teacher at a school in kuwait who gave only his first 
name 
he seemed in a quandary about the journey wondering aloud 
whether he should take his wife men waiting with him strongly 
advised that she stay in egypt 
on aug 2 about 15 million egyptians worked in the two persian 
gulf states at least 400000 fled in the days that followed 
thronging refugee camps in jordan to await ferries to egypt 
western and arab countries helped by sending aircraft and other 
aid 
but as weeks passed returnees began feeling secure enough to 
worry about possessions or jobs left behind 
an egyptian in alexandria told of a friend who had worked in 
kuwait for many years but fled the advancing iraqis leaving his 
car and other belongings 
he went back last month and recently returned home in the car 
it was stuffed with electric appliances silverware china and his 
wifes mink coat 
interior minister abdelhalim moussa said 5062 egyptians left 
for iraq and kuwait through midseptember 
some believe they can find jobs because many egyptian workers 
left for home he said in an interview published wednesday in 
alahaly a weekly newspaper others leave to bring back their 
belongings and documents 
figures at the iraqi consulate were far below moussas and a 
consular officer could not explain the discrepancy he said the 
office issued only about 800 permits through midseptember with 
hundreds more being processed he said most were for egyptians 
returning to jobs in kuwait 
of about 15 men and three women outside the iraqi consulate all 
but one said they planned to bring back family members or 
possessions fearing iraqi harassment all asked not be identified 
or allowed use only of first names 
i love kuwait its like my second home said a man who 
worked there as an expert with the kuwait navy theres no way 
im going to work there for those people the iraqis id fight 
them if i could 
ahmed a burly man in dark glasses said he was returning to 
kuwait for his wife and three children they were stranded by the 
invasion while ahmed was vacationing in cairo 
closely examining an iraqi permit handed to a teacher ahmed 
told him youd better be careful i hear the iraqis are keeping 
the teachers and not letting them leave 
mahmoud one of three teachers outside the consultate wednesday 
was the only one considering working in occupied kuwait ahmed and 
two others attempted to dissuade him the atmosphere in kuwait is 
terrible now destruction and terror ahmed said the iraqis

france stopped issuing visas to 
lebanese on wednesday apparently because of president elias 
hrawis refusal to lift a blockade intended to end the rebellion by 
gen michel aoun 
also wednesday funeral services were held in this coastal town 
and other villages for 30 people shot to death monday during a 
candlelight vigil in support of aoun women hurled themselves onto 
the coffins of husbands and sons while mourners booed because the 
papal nuncio failed to attend the services church bells tolled 
the communistrun voice of the people radio station reported 
france was no longer issuing visas to lebanese and a french 
embassy source confirmed the report 
the military blockade of the area controlled by aoun prevents 
french consular officials from commuting between their two embassy 
branches to complete visa formalities the embassy source said the 
source spoke on condition of anonymity 
french ambassador rene ala on monday conveyed to hrawi frances 
displeasure with the blockade saying it would hurt the blockaded 
regions population of 150000 more than aoun and his 15000 mainly 
christian soldiers the voice of the people said 
ala told hrawi the french government may close its embassy in 
moslem west beirut if hrawi fails to lift the siege but hrawi 
flatly rejected the french demand and threat the report said 
the ambassador drove from hrawis west beirut residence to the 
french embassy office in the christian suburb of hazmiyeh in aouns 
zone but was forced to get out of his car and walk part of the way 
with his bodyguards the radio report said ala later left for 
paris it said 
france has sympathized with the maronite catholic community 
which supported its 19201943 mandate in lebanon and has dominated 
the country since independnce 
hrawi and aoun are maronites the syrianbacked hrawi was 
elected president nov 24 with a mandate to enforce an arab 
leaguebrokered plan to end the 15yearold civil war between 
moslems and christians

submission 
on monday night thousands of aouns supporters demonstrated on a 
highway bridge spanning the death river to protest the blockade 
the rally was raked by gunfire and police said at least 30 people 
were killed and 100 wounded 
aoun blamed the massacre on christian warlord samir geageas 
lebanese forces militia which shares control of the area near the 
bridge with hrawis soldiers 
hrawis government said its troops did not fire on 
demonstrators geagea accused aoun of engineering the killings to 
win sympathy 
earlier this year aoun and geagea fought a fourmonth war for 
control of the 310squaremile christian area north and northeast 
of beirut 
the confrontation which claimed more than 1000 lives left the 
area partitioned geageas 6000strong militia hold about 80 
percent of the region while aouns forces command meten province

the supreme court in a case that could 
reshape how the american legal system penalizes wrongdoers in 
lawsuits wrestled wednesday with conflicting theories and accounts 
of skyrocketing punitive damage awards 
the outcome of the alabama case in which an insurance company 
was ordered to pay 1 million for fraud could have enormous impact 
on businesses and consumers 
bruce a beckman a lawyer for the insurance company said the 
jury that awarded the money to a 59yearold mother of five 
violated the companys constitutional dueprocess right to receive 
fair treatment 
in the jury room all it had to go on was its own notion of 
right and wrong beckman said that is exactly the arbitrary 
and discriminatory enforcement due process condemns 
the system means wealthy companies are hit with multimillion 
dollar awards even if the fault is small he said 
but bruce j ennis jr representing the woman said the penalty 
was based on a 200year tradition that gives juries broad but not 
unfettered discretion to award punitive damages 
you should not throw subtle state tort law into disarray 
without substantial evidence that the majority of awards are 
unfair ennis told the court 
urging judicial restraint he said there does not have to 
be a constitutional remedy for every problem 
punitive damages have been used throughout the land for 200 
years he said only nine states ennis said have placed 
monetary limits on the awards after extensive reexamination by 
legislatures 
the hourlong argument underscored the complexity and 
uncertainty surrounding the issue including the possibility of 
high court deadlock 
a 44 split among the justices who took part wednesday could 
prompt the court to rehear the dispute later in its justbegun 
199091 term 
david h souter confirmed by the senate on tuesday to become 
the courts newest justice wont be sworn in and take his seat on 
the bench until next tuesday 
a ruling in the case isnt likely until next year even if it 
isnt reargued 
the dispute pits the pacific mutual life insurance co of 
newport beach calif against cleopatra haslip a former 
8800ayear librarian for roosevelt city ala a poor largely 
black suburb of birmingham 
mrs haslip discovered her insurance coverage had lapsed after 
incurring 3500 in hospital and medical bills in 1982 for 
treatment of a kidney infection 
the insurance agent who arranged health coverage for roosevelt 
city workers had pocketed the premiums 
pacific mutual said it had not sanctioned nor was aware of the 
agents misdeeds 
the hospital demanded 600 before it would discharge mrs 
haslip her doctor turned her case over to a collection agency and 
her credit suffered from her inability to pay the bills 
mrs haslip who was in the audience during wednesdays 
proceedings said she still owes money and has not collected the 
1040000 awarded by the jury in alabama 
the justices questioned both lawyers extensively wednesday 
demonstrating their apparent uncertainty about how to decide the 
case 
justice antonin scalia noted that punitive damage awards have a 
long tradition 
who whispers in my ear its a violation of due process when 
its been going on since 1791 he asked beckman 
justice sandra day oconnor in questioning ennis said she is 
troubled when juries impose big awards without guidelines 
giving juries limitless discretion is a very strange notion of 
what due process means she said 
the case has attracted stacks of legal briefs on both sides 
business groups the american medical association the 
pharmaceutical industry and major news media companies have urged 
the court to restrict or ban punitive damages saying runaway 
juries unfairly penalize wealthy defendants out of sympathy for 
victims 
consumer advocates and lawyer groups defend large punitive 
awards they say the judgments help keep dangerous products off the 
market and protect the public against corporate greed

irans parliament erupted in fistfights 
wednesday when radicals accused spiritual leader ayatollah ali 
khamenei of rigging a forthcoming election for a key government 
body sources said 
the outcome of the election next week could determine whether 
the government body retains khamenei as irans top spiritual 
leader or replace him with a council of radicals who oppose 
irans recent overtures to the west 
tehran radio which was broadcasting the heated parliamentary 
debate live abruptly went off the air as the arguments turned into 
a scuffle the sources in tehran told the associated press in 
telephone interviews 
there was no report in the official media on the unruly scenes 
in the 270member parliament but the sources speaking on 
condition of anonymity said several deputies were involved in the 
fights no details were provided 
the fistfights in parliament known as the majlis sharply 
underlined the deep divisions between the socalled pragmatists led 
by president hashemi rafsanjani and his hardline opponents 
the violence in the majlis where debates are frequently lively 
capped months of maneuvering by rafsanjani and khamenei to control 
the government body and a watchdog group 
the government body the 83member assembly of experts among 
other things chooses irans spiritual leader the highest 
authority in the islamic revolution the assembly has an election 
scheduled for monday 
the watchdog body is the 12member council of guardians 
it has long screened legislation to ensure it conforms to 
islamic tenets and it recently was given the chore of screening 
parliamentary candidates for their ideological suitability that 
chore had been done by theologians 
the assembly of experts has been moved from the holy city of 
qom south of tehran to the capital in recent weeks in what is 
seen as an attempt by rafsanjani to bring it more under his 
influence 
the assembly overwhelmingly chose khamenei 51 to succeed the 
late ayatollah ruhollah khomeini after his death from cancer in 
june 1989 
the vehemently antiwestern hardliners accuse khamenei of 
siding with rafsanjani khamenei takes a more aggressive posture on 
foreign affairs than the president but both have been seeking to 
sideline hardline revolutionary radicals who they believe are 
hampering efforts to liberalize the revolution 
rafsanjani is seeking to improve links with the west and irans 
arab neighbors to secure badly needed investment and advanced 
technology to rebuild the economy following the 198088 war with 
iraq 
the radicals claim such policies undermine the islamic 
revolution and deviate from khomeinis fundamentalist doctrine 
the hardliners led by former interior minister ali akbar 
mohtashemi have recently zeroed in on what many see as khameneis 
weak spot claiming he does not have the islamic qualifications to 
be khomeinis successor 
khamenei lacks the top clerical rank of marja taqlid or source 
of imitation and was only a middleranking cleric with the title 
hojatoleslam or authority on islam when he was elected supreme 
leader he was swiftly promoted to the rank of ayatollah or mirror 
of god 
but constitutional amendments approved in july lowered the 
religious qualifications for the leader in favor of political ones 
the sources in tehran said the hardliners were seeking to win 
enough seats in mondays election for the assembly of experts to 
depose khamenei and replace him with a radicaldominated leadership 
council 
to prevent that khamenei ordered his supporters on the council 
of guardians to rule that all candidates pass an examination before 
running 
so far the assembly members only have had to have good 
revolutionary credentials the new law requires them to to be 
religious jurisprudents 
of 169 candidates who took the exam 60 flunked most of them 
radicals including parliament speaker mehdi karrubi the sources 
reported 
other radicals refused to submit to the examination three 
hardliners who iid pass later withdrew their names in protest 
khamenei speaking to former prisonersofwar on wednesday said 
the new qualification was to determine whether candidates could 
shoulder major responsibilities in the countrys 
administration 
he said rivalries such as the confrontation with the radicals 
are characteristic of the western democracies which neglect god 
and religion 
assadollah bayat a hardline legislator said the council 
should not devise pietymeters and faithometers to assess the 
candidates 
warning against insults leveled against the council khamenei 
said 
i will not tolerate slanders which have been made during 
the past few days against the council of guardians to be 
repeated irans constitution says anyone opposing khamenei could 
be tried for treason

milwaukee workers rallied in memory of a woman 
who died while trying to pay off a medical debt and a clinic was 
established in a los angeles park as part of a nationwide drive 
wednesday to build momentum for a federal healthcare policy 
rallies information booths picket lines and other activities 
were planned at 50000 work sites around the country according to 
the unions sponsoring the oneday campaign jobs with justice 
health care action day 
the effort is aimed at convincing congress and the white house 
that there is an urgent need for a federal health care policy some 
37 million americans have no health care insurance and millions 
more are underinsured according to organizers of wednesdays 
events 
in milwaukee a rally and candlelight vigil were planned in 
memory of linda williams 
she was working three different parttime jobs none of which 
offered health insurance to support two children in 1986 when she 
learned she needed a 60000 heart operation said ellen bravo 
executive director of milwaukee 9to5 a group representing office 
and clerical workers 
williams had found a new job and had taken a second job this 
year to try to pay off the remaining debt when she died on the job 
of a heart attack bravo said 
who killed linda williams in our opinion she was the victim 
of a lack of a national health care policy bravo said 
in los angeles the service employees union sponsored a 
healthcare clinic in a park to raise awareness about 10000 
teachers assistants 600 hotel workers and 2000 janitors involved 
in bitter battles to gain health care coverage from their 
employers 
none of the workers has health insurance said union spokeswoman 
jennifer fleming the union lined up doctors and nurses to spend 
the afternoon providing free blood pressure vision and hearing 
checks 
in texas state workers in austin are rallying over the 23 
percent rise in health care premiums scheduled to take effect later 
this year 
eduardo diaz leader of a state workers union said whats 
really burning people is that somehow congress has figured out a 
way to pump billions into the sampl crisis yet they have not found 
the will to institute a national health care system diaz said 
similar rallies were held among other cities in new york 
salem ore jackson miss providence ri and new haven conn 
the boilermakers union in norfolk va planned a oneday 
demonstration at the norfolk shipyard to protest proposed health 
care cuts in current contract negotiations 
workers in some cities planned to picket outside hospitals 
others planned to demonstrate at fastfood restaurants because 
healthcare coverage is rare for workers in that industry 
both the medical community and the insurance industry which 
frequently take much of the blame for spiraling healthcare costs 
issued statements commending union workers on the campaign 
however the american medical associations statement said a 
governmentfunded and regulated health care system which many 
unions back as one option would be an expensive invitation to 
disaster 
instead the ama said there are ways to fix current weaknesses 
in the system such as providing tax breaks to small businesses 
that provide coverage

wilderness acres in five northwest states 
the rock stars appearing on behalf of the alliance for the wild 
rockies said taxpayer money is being used to drill build roads 
and clearcut trees on us national forests

talked about this morning said king a grammyaward winning 
songwriter and singer 
the environmental group based in missoula mont wants to ban 
logging mining and roadbuilding on public lands stretching 
through idaho montana wyoming oregon and washington 
its proposed legislation also would protect 917 miles of 
potential wild and scenic rivers and launch studies on nearly 2 
million acres of national park candidates 
representatives of the organization met with a half dozen 
lawmakers on tuesday and scheduled meetings again wednesday 
some environmental groups are like the unpopular kids at a 
high school dance who stand around in the corner because no one 
wants to dance with them said oates of the band hall amp oates 
im here to see if i cant get someone to dance with them 
he said during a news conference in front of the capitol

national park and a specialist on the grizzly bear said there were 
no formal sponsors so far but he was optimistic there soon would 
be one 
bader said king oates and grateful dead band member bob weir 
have asked what they can to do to help further the groups cause 
these celebrities are real people they have real concerns 
they have seen the destruction that has happened on our public 
lands and they want to do their part to help he said 
oates and weir joined actor bill curry on a bicycle ride through 
montana this summer to view the effects of clearcutting on the 
regions forests 
a few months ago i didnt know the difference between a 
national forest and a national park oates said logging is 
allowed on national forests but not on national parks 
curry said he got involved in the issue when he moved from new 
york city to montanas bitterroot valley about 18 months ago 
i bought lands near a national park and they clearcut 300 
acres behind my house when i learned that i paid for that in 
taxes i was outraged he said 
king said efforts to defeat environmental legislation are based 
on concern about the impact on jobs but she said the groups 
proposal would create new jobs for restoring the health of the

withdrawing a job quota plan aimed at 
helping lowercaste hindus could only lead to further violence 
prime minister vp singh said in an interview wednesday 
seventyfive people have died in riots or committed suicide in 
protest since the government announced aug 7 that it was reserving 
almost half of all federal jobs for lowercaste hindus there are 
now some 17 million unemployed educated youths in india many of 
them from the upper castes 
singh told the united news of india that withdrawing his job 
quota program could lead to more violence 
the expectations of lowercaste hindus have been raised and a 
policy reversal now would be difficult and possibly cause more 
violence singh said 
the supreme court has barred implementation of the job quotas 
until it determines their legality the court has scheduled a 
hearing for oct 25 
singh reiterated the governments position that the quotas will 
bring about social equity for lowercaste hindus who have been 
suppressed for centuries 
hindus are divided into four major castes that determine a 
persons social standing and often his economic position modern 
india whose 880 million people are 82 percent hindu professes 
secularism and bans discrimination on the basis of caste however 
the traditions remain 
public dissatisfaction over the job quotas has been widespread 
in the politically influential cities of northern india the army 
has been called out and curfews imposed in several towns because 
of rioting 
northern india also has been plagued by renewed religious 
violence this week united news of india said it said fighting 
between hindus and moslems has claimed at least 40 lives in three 
days in the region 
the violence was apparently triggered by a hindu groups 
decision to build a temple at a site claimed by moslems the hindus 
say they will begin constructing the temple oct 30 in the town of 
ayodhya 325 miles southeast of new delhi 
a 16th century mosque stands at the site which the hindus say 
they will tear down hindus claim the mosque is built over the 
birthplace of lord rama an incarnation of lord vishnu one of the 
most important hindu gods

federal reserve chairman alan greenspan 
bestowed his endorsement on the 500 billion deficitreduction 
package wednesday telling congress that failure to approve the 
agreement would be a grave mistake with serious consequences 
for an already weakened us economy 
greenspans views were considered crucial to chances for success 
by a bush administration that is hoping the fed will support the 
pact by lowering interest rates 
greenspan did not specifically promise to lower interest rates 
but he replied with an emphatic most certainly when asked 
whether he believed an enacted budget agreement would exert 
downward pressure on rates 
the budget summit has crafted what appears to be a credible 
enforceable reduction in the budget deficit stretching over a 
number of years greenspan said in reading a statement at a 
congressional hearing 
if enacted the budget package should reduce the drain of the 
federal deficit on our national savings lessen pressures in credit 
markets and enhance investment and the longrun growth potential of 
the united states he said 
congressional and administration negotiators reached agreement 
over the weekend on a package of spending cuts and tax increases 
aimed at lowering the deficit by 500 billion over five years 
through a combination of tax increases and spending cuts 
while many in congress have expressed unhappiness over various 
components greenspan said he believed the negotiators had 
unearthed the maximum cut in the deficit feasible at this time 
with about the only mix possible given the political context 
he said that rejection of the package would significantly dim 
prospects for coming to grips with the corrosive effects of 
budget deficits on the economy and would also make 
alreadyjittery financial markets even more worried 
failure to enact the agreement would in my estimation be a 
grave mistake greenspan said 
i am fearful that failure to enact the agreement would produce 
an adverse reaction in financial markets that could undercut our 
economy already significantly weakened by the shock of the middle 
east crisis and problems in our financial system he added 
greenspans comments came at a house government operations 
subcommittee hearing on deposit insurance reform in a series of 
questions he sought to allay concerns expressed by republican 
members of the subcommittee 
some of the most vocal critics of the deficitcutting plan have 
been house republicans and the administration sees winning their 
support as crucial to the ultimate success of the package 
president bush said wednesday that congress would be courting 
disaster by failing to ratify the agreement but the white house 
conceded that it did not yet have enough votes for passage in the 
house 
in his congressional appearance greenspan agreed that the 
economic assumptions underlying the deficit accord might be on 
the edge of being unrealistic and the full 500 billion in 
deficit cuts were not likely to come about 
but he said that the package was a credible step in lowering 
federal borrowing demands which he termed a serious threat to 
economic growth 
the budget package also received the endorsement wednesday of 
greenspans predecessor as fed chairman paul volcker 
volcker on capitol hill to testify before another committee 
said that failure to pass the plan would be a very bad signal 
greenspan for months has stressed the need to enact a 
deficitreduction plan viewed as credible by financial markets he 
has said that once such a plan was approved the fed would do its 
part by lowering interest rates to offset the negative effects on 
the economy from lower government spending and higher taxes 
since the agreement was announced sunday interest rates for 
longterm bonds a key factor determining mortgage rates have 
fallen slightly as investors have given at least a modest vote of 
approval to the package 
federal reserve policymakers held a key meeting tuesday to map 
strategy for coming weeks 
many analysts believe the fed officials voted during their 
closeddoor meeting to lower shortterm interest rates and put the 
rate cuts into effect if congressional work is completed on the 
deficit package later this month

tragedy revisited monacos royal 
family wednesday when stefano casiraghi husband of princess 
caroline died in a speedboat accident while defending his world 
title 
caroline a widow at 33 donned black mourning clothes and 
rushed home from paris where she was visiting eight years and 
three weeks earlier her mother princess grace died after a car 
crash 
witnesses said casiraghi 30 and copilot patrice innocenti 
drove their catamaran the pinot di pinot straight into a wave at 
about 93 mph during a morning heat of the world offshore 
championships being held near monaco 
the 42foot boat flipped over ejecting innocenti witnesses 
said casiraghi remained strapped to his seat and bore the full 
impact of the vessel slamming into the water the twoengine 
fiveton boat then sank witnesses said 
gianfranco rossi head of the race organizing committee told a 
news conference casiraghi was killed instantly he said other 
competitors as well as divers and a doctor rushed to the stricken 
boat and found casiraghi trapped in the cockpit already dead 
casiraghi was a sophisticated international financier when at 
23 he married caroline on dec 29 1983 
at his death he was chairman of cogefar france the french 
subsidiary of an italian construction group owned by fiat he also 
held a 52 percent interest in engeco which owns about 3000 
apartments in monaco and is building a 160 million apartment 
complex 
and he was the father of three children two sons and a 
daughter 
casiraghi and innocenti had been favored to win the threestage 
race featuring sleek boats capable of speeds up to 125 mph 
the accident came 30 minutes after the second stage opened 
wednesday organizers canceled the days events but said they would 
resume thursday or friday 
casiraghi had a passion for offshore racing a competitor since 
1984 he had won 12 of 80 races including last years world 
championship held off atlantic city nj 
weather conditions off saintjeancapferrat between monaco and 
nice were described as normal 
he surely didnt have time to look out and at that speed 
stuck under the boat must have been killed by the blow said 
another racer michel karsten 
emergency crews quickly pulled both men out of the water 
innocenti was rushed to princess grace hospital and casiraghi 
reportedly was taken to the adjoining morgue 
the palace issued a twosentence communique confirming the death 
about four hours after the accident 
the hospital said innocenti the boats driver was being 
treated for his injuries it did not elaborate 
caroline the oldest child of prince rainier iii and the former 
hollywood star grace kelly divorced french playboy philippe junot 
in 1980 she married casiraghi on dec 29 1983 in a civil ceremony 
under a portrait of her late mother 
they had three children andrea 6 charlotte 4 and pierre 
3 
their marriage brought some joy back to a family that was 
devastated by the death of princess grace in september 1982 
the automobile accident injured carolines younger sister 
princess stephanie and left prince rainier emotionally 
thunderstruck 
the relatively lowprofile lifestyle caroline had enjoyed since 
marrying casiraghi contrasted vividly with the weekly splash she 
made in the tabloids during the 1970s 
the couple were reported to have a close relationship and 
divided their time between monaco the tiny minicipality ruled by 
carolines family since the 13th century and casiraghis home 
outside milan 
their marriage followed carolines unhappy twoyear union with 
junot who was 17 years her senior he was photographed many times 
during their marriage in the company of other women 
a roman catholic caroline sought to have her first marriage 
annulled so she could wed casiraghi in a religious ceremony and 
have their children recognized by the church she was never granted 
the annulment 
casiraghi was born sept 8 1960 the son of giancarlo 
casiraghi a selfmade millionaire industrialist 
he attended private catholic schools including the gaillo 
college in como he studied economics at the university of bocconi 
considered italys most prestigious business school but never 
graduated 
instead he launched his first business redim a real estate 
concern that success was followed by export companies that sold 
sweaters and shoes in the united states 
casiraghi also relished the pleasures of the jet set he 
vacationed in chic resorts like saintmoritz in the alps and 
saintjeancapferrat on the riviera where his family owned homes 
he met caroline at jimmys a monaco nightclub and soon broke 
off his engagement to pinuccia macheda he impressed the grimaldi 
family with his maturity and quickly won their approval 
corriere della sera one of italys leading dailies once called 
him one of the true young lions of the jet set 
casiraghi had two older brothers marco and danielle and a 
younger sister rosalba

the art gallery director who is on trial for 
showing homoerotic photos by robert mapplethorpe testified in his 
own defense wednesday that he never wavered in his commitment to 
display the works 
dennis barrie on trial with the contemporary arts center on 
obscenity charges said he and the gallerys board had talked about 
the controversy an exhibit of the photos had triggered in 
washington dc 
the governmentsupported showing of mapplethorpes photos was 
canceled last year in washington amid a debate over federal funding 
of art the national endowment for the arts now requires grant 
applicants to certify that the awards will not be used for work 
that might be considered obscene sen jesse helms rnc pressed 
for the policy 
barrie however said the board strongly supported going ahead 
with the exhibit 
this was an exhibition of high quality it had been seen in 
other cities and was by a wellknown artist barrie testified 
under questioning by his lawyer h louis sirkin in hamilton 
county municipal court 
seven photographs in the 175photo exhibit are at the center of 
the trial five show graphic sex acts involving men and two show 
children whose genitals are exposed 
barrie said he was not asked to alter the exhibit in any way and 
would not have considered doing so 
under crossexamination by assistant city prosecutor frank 
prouty barrie restated the gallerys commitment to display the 
photos 
i thought we had every right and every reason to bring this 
exhibition to this city he said 
prouty showed barrie mapplethorpes five photographs of explicit 
sex acts and asked barrie to comment on them 
he knew about light he knew about shadow as difficult as 
the subject matter may be you see the ability of the man working 
through he was brilliant with a camera barrie said 
the gallery boards legal counsel stuart schloss testified 
earlier wednesday that the board tried to get legal protection 
before the show the board filed a lawsuit asking the court to rule 
whether the exhibit was obscene 
the case was never heard and was dismissed the day before the 
april 7 public opening of robert mapplethorpe the perfect 
moment 
on april 7 a hamilton county grand jury viewed the exhibit and 
returned misdemeanor indictments charging the gallery and barrie 
with pandering obscenity and using children in nudityrelated 
material 
if convicted of both misdemeanor charges barrie could be 
sentenced to one year in jail and fined 2000 the gallery could 
be fined 10000 for conviction on both counts 
prosecutors argued that they needed only to show that the 
photographs were displayed in public leaving it to the jury to 
determine whether the photographs were obscene 
schloss testified that gallery officials thought the artistic 
merit of the exhibit made it exempt from ohios obscenity laws 
at no time did we consider it obscene schloss said it 
was a serious artistic exhibit 
owen findsen an arts reviewer for the cincinnati enquirer and 
jerry stein arts critic for the cincinnati post testified tuesday 
and wednesday that they thought the exhibit had artistic merit 
the us supreme courts legal test for an obscenity 
determination asks whether the dominant theme of the artwork 
appeals to prurient interest in sex whether the work is patently 
offensive based on contemporary community standards and whether 
the work lacks serious artistic or political value 
defense witnesses have described the exhibit as a retrospective 
of the professional life of mapplethorpe who died of aids in march 
1989 at age 42 
the exhibit drew more than 80000 people before its sevenweek 
engagement ended may 26 
it went on to boston where it opened despite protests and 
103000 tickets have been sold the boston show closes this week

the washington university bears secondleading 
receiver will miss the oct 20 football game against colorado 
college because of a previous commitment 
chris warlick a senior biology major is going to be the only 
undergraduate in the country to address more than 5000 top medical 
specialists at the american society of human geneticists national 
convention in cincinnati 
its certainly distinctly unusual for this to occur said 
victor mckusick a professor of genetics at johns hopkins i 
cant remember any in the recent past 
the title of warlicks work isolation of a yeast artificial 
chromosome clone d14s26 near a gene for familial hypertrophic 
cardiomyopathy and identification of two new restriction fragment 
length polymorphism probes at this locus 
hes a very smart guy and he has a great career ahead of 
himself as a scientist said helen doniskeller professor of 
genetics at washington universitys school of medicine the work 
that hes doing is of great interest in the scientific community 
these days 
thats not so odd at washington university a division iii 
school which has a reputation for producing scholars 
there are no athletic scholarships so warlick and his teammates 
play for the love of the game 
practice starts at 4 pm at least an hour later than for most 
teams because many players have labs late in the day and even at 
that time coach larry kindbom has become accustomed to starting 
practice with about threefourths of his squad 
last week warlick had an 80yard touchdown catch and he has 15 
receptions for 255 yards and three touchdowns on the year 
i wish i had a couple of years left to play but its not 
conducive with my future plans he said 
warlick is a bminus student struggling with calculus and 
organic chemistry two killers thank goodness theyre of no 
practical value he said 
put him in a laboratory and everything changes 
in the summer of 1989 warlick began working in a genetics lab 
at the schools medical center this spring the lab was part of a 
project that also involved several other labs around the country in 
a continuing attempt to map human genes 
warlicks main focus was an area of a chromosome near a marker 
for a hereditary heart ailment familial hypertrophic 
cardiomyopathy its a disease with no outward symptoms that can 
strike quickly and fatally 
warlick discovered two markers on the chromosome that could help 
narrow the search for the gene that causes the disease his 
discoveries will soon become permanent fixtures on the updated 
human genetic map and will bear his initials cw1 and cw2 
its excitng mckusick said but added i wouldnt call 
it earth shattering 
this is the type of approach being used all over the place for 
identifying the gene defect in particular diseases such as 
cystic fibrosis mckusick added 
but warlicks discovery is so complex that he has trouble 
boiling it down in laymans terms 
he hopes to be involved in furthering this study but doesnt 
want to miss out on any student experiences 
college is probably the last chance you have to experience 
these extremes and im taking advantage of it while i can he 
said 
hes an adopted son of ernie warlick a tight end for the 
national football leagues buffalo bills in the 1960s but until 
last season had not played the sport since age 10 because he was 
undersized 
now hes 6foot4 and 180 but it was academics that got him into 
washington university he ranked eighth in his high school class in 
williamsville ny and turned down dartmouth and johns hopkins to 
accept a fulltuition scholarship awarded to talented collegebound 
blacks 
coach kindbom said three freshmen on the team turned down 
athletic scholarships to attend washington u 
football is a very important part of their lives but they 
want to do more than get locked into a situation he said 
were talking about people who taste nothing but success or else 
they wouldnt be here

germans in east and west have made it clear that 
soviet president mikhail s gorbachev is the man of the hour for 
clearing the way for unification of the two countries 
since last year talks with ordinary germans have revealed a 
deepseated admiration for the kremlin reformer seeking to overhaul 
more than seven decades of communist thinking 
and as the two german states merged at midnight tuesday 
political leaders praised the man who boldly broke with the 
soviets traditional refusal to even consider unification 
we thank president gorbachev chancellor helmut kohl said in 
a unificationeve television address to the nation he recognized 
the nations right to pursue their own path 
without this decision we would have not experienced the day 
of german unity so soon kohl added 
in fact a heavy outlay of deutsche marks helped gorbachev 
swallow his national pride and clear the way for unification 
germany will pay the kremlin 95 billion toward the cost of 
removing the soviets 360000 troops from former east german 
territory even more aid is likely in years to come 
late wednesday a german government spokesman said gorbachev 
will visit germany next month to sign a germansoviet friendship 
treaty he is likely to receive a heros welcome from grateful 
germans 
many germans despite their near heroworship of gorbachev 
worry that he will not hang on to power that concern reportedly 
spurred kohl to quicken the pace of unification before a power 
struggle in the kremlin could send things back to square one 
gorbachevs change of mind on germany was an abrupt switch for 
the soviet people who for years cited their 20 million dead in 
world war ii as the grounds for their suspicion and often hatred 
of the germans 
previous soviet leaders exercised their dominance over east 
germanys thencommunist regime to block any talk of unification 
during a formal state ceremony on wednesday german president 
richard von weizsaecker also paid tribute to gorbachev 
many people among them we germans have reason to be 
thankful von weizsaecker told the several hundred guests 
the german lawmakers from east and west gave berlin mayor walter 
momper a long round of applause at the same ceremony after he 
singled out gorbachev for praise 
gorbachev visited thenwest germany in june 1989 receiving a 
heros welcome as people cheered and basked in what became known as 
gorbymania 
gone were the chilly meetings of west germans and soviets with 
the newstyle kremlin leader winning friends wherever he went 
even then few could guess that just four months later 
gorbachev would make another german visit with even more important 
consquences 
in early october gorbachev came to berlin and bluntly told 
thencommunist boss erich honecker to get on with a reform policy 
life punishes whoever comes late gorbachev told the 
77yearold honecker using a russian proverb that most germans 
have since memorized 
the message was clear the soviets would no longer support the 
fossilized east berlin regime that was then shaken by an exodus of 
thousands of refugees 
less than two weeks later on oct 18 honecker was ousted in a 
move that led to the breathtaking pace of unification 
as the lights went out on the sovereign east germany and the 
mighty new country took center stage outgoing prime minister 
lothar de maiziere thanked gorbachev as well 
de maiziere said gorbachev cleared the way for east germanys 
peaceful revolution by refusing to prop up an antireform system 
with the force of weapons 
that revolution in turn led to unification

blame me president bush invites nervous 
republicans as he searches for votes to pass an unpopular package 
of tax increases and spending cuts the budget deal may be painful 
now but the alternative probably is a deep recession that could 
doom bushs reelection hopes in 1992 
bush has put his popularity squarely on the line for an 
agreement that has sent electionminded congressmen diving into 
foxholes the deal will hurt everyone with higher taxes on 
gasoline cigarettes liquor and wine and increased health care 
costs for the elderly in medicare 
its like drinking a gallon of castor oil said sen john 
warner rva but were going to do it 
maybe so but republicans lawmakers led by house whip newt 
gingrich and other members of the gop leadership have deserted 
their president in droves they are particularly angry over bushs 
reversal on his nonewtaxes pledge robbing republicans of the 
same popular campaign cry that propelled bush into the white house 
to win back the dissidents bush made a televised speech to the 
nation asking americans to take some bitter medicine to restore the 
health of americas economy he warned that if the agreement does 
not pass our economy will falter markets may tumble and 
recession will follow 
presidential warnings of a dire economic future are only part of 
a strategy that also includes armtwisting sessions with 
republicans at the white house and private appeals in telephone 
calls 
bushs highprofile stand is intended to give politicians a 
ready excuse for digging deeper into taxpayers pockets 
say the president encouraged you to do it bush said 
blame me because i know whats best for our country but i dont 
suspect its politically popular 
while all 435 house seats are up for grabs bush is not running 
for reelection this year his political life is not on the line 
so its probably better for bush to take his licks now 
theyve analyzed the economic situation and realize its only 
going to get worse said university of virginia political 
scientist larry sabato 
its better to make a corrective move now than closer to his 
reelection year sabato said its better for bush to have a 
recession now than in 1991 or 1992 
with his high popularity ratings bush can afford to take a hit 
his ratings have been bumping along as high as 80 percent buoyed 
by approval of his handling of the persian gulf crisis 
the persian gulf gives him some shield some protection 
sabato said presidential popularity becomes impervious to damage 
in foreign crises 
bush insists he is not making his decisions on the basis of the 
election calendar 
its i guess about as complicated as a period as weve had 
since ive been president bush said referring to the twin 
problems of the budget and the gulf but im not looking at it in 
terms of reelection the american people are entitled to 
something a little bit more broadergauged than that 
both sides in the budget battle are playing the underdog for 
the white house that would make a victory seem to be an even 
bigger triumph from bushs opponents it is a message that bush 
doesnt need every gop vote 
curiously bush is not demanding complete republican loyalty on 
what he says is a vote to avoid economic catastrophe there is no 
threat of white house retaliation no warning of political 
punishment 
bush even holds open the possibility that he could make a 
campaign appearance for someone who votes against the budget 
agreement 
i cant bring myself to be recriminatory the president 
said 
i wish all of them republicans would support me strongly and 
lay aside some of the passions that one of the other of them have 
on a specific issue bush said that probably isnt going to 
happen if i believe what im hearing on the television 
so now what ive got to do is get 501 percent and then were 
home 
sabato the political scientist says that in withholding 
threats against rebellious republicans bush is simply making a 
virtue out of necessity 
bush is not dumb enough to go up against the antitax wing of 
the republican party too hard sabato said thats probably 
half his party

world leaders warmly welcomed a united germany 
into the international community wednesday but echoes of past wars 
and concerns about the balance of power tempered some european 
enthusiasm 
a new era is beginning for germany for europe and indeed we 
hope for the world secretary of state james a baker iii 
declared in new york president bush proclaimed germanamerican day 
in the united states 
in moscow president mikhail s gorbachev paid tribute to the 
peaceful and worthy solution of the german issue 
he cited all those in my country and in your country who 
overcoming sorrows remembering losses and honoring the dead did 
not yield to prejudice and fears 
the unification symbolizes europes historic turning point in 
the direction of establishing a new order said toshiki kaifu 
prime minister of japan 
the japanese newspaper asahi shimbun said very few europeans 
seriously suspect a danger of germany once again provoking war 
it noted the keen awareness the germans have exhibited of their 
war responsibility and by their peaceful behavior over nearly 
half a century 
west germanys emergence as an economic power and the potential 
strength of a united germany unsettle some europeans including 
britains prime minister margaret thatcher 
germany will be very dominant in europe so it will be up to 
the rest of us not to allow it to dominate others of us have 
powerful voices she said in a british television interview this 
week 
but in a message to german prime minister helmut kohl she told 
the german people we face the future as friends allies and 
partners 
for germanys neighbors to the north this is the first time 
in centuries that denmark can view the coming togetherof a 
stronger german state with calm and sympathy said the 
conservative copenhagen daily newspaper berlingske tidende 
the reestablishment of german unity takes place with the full 
understanding of all the countrys neighbors the newspaper said

reference to the holocaust 
french president francois mitterrand also concerned about 
german dominance told kohl we have come a long way together we 
are going to continue tell those close to you tell all germans 
of the solidarity of france 
the french leftist daily liberation said germany united is 
the victory of european reason but it warned on oct 3 1990 
forgetting is forbidden forgetting the distant past as well as the 
recent neither the memory of auschwitz nor that of democratic and

the nuclear regulatory commission named a task 
force wednesday to review emergency evacuation plans at the pilgrim 
nuclear power plant in plymouth mass 
the task force would be charged with determining whether the 
nrc should reconsider its finding that there is reasonable 
assurance that adequate measures can and will be taken in the event 
of a radiological emergency at pilgrim according to an nrc 
release 
the nrc move follows a report issued in july by the commissions 
inspector general that criticized the way the agency staff handled 
emergency preparedness planning two years ago when the plant was 
being readied for restart 
james m taylor the nrcs executive director for operations 
said the decision to assign a task force to examine pilgrims 
emergency planning comes in response to the many critical 
comments made at a public meeting last month in plymouth 
according to the nrc release 
the announcement also comes a day after rep gerry studds 
dmass announced that a house investigatory panel would hold a 
hearing in plymouth on oct 22 on the nrcs handling of emergency 
preparedness issues 
in his july report nrc inspector general david c williams said 
commission staffers gave the nrc false information by declaring 
that residents near the pilgrim plant could be protected in an 
emergency 
the scathing 15page report concluded that the commission staff 
said pilgrim was safe to operate without looking in detail at 
evacuation plans the report accused staffers of relying on 
unconfirmed information provided by the plants owner boston 
edison co 
the misleading statements were made in october and december 1988 
just before the nrc approved the reopening of the pilgrim plant 
the plant had been shut down since april 1986 due to chronic 
management and mechanical problems 
following the inspector generals report edison officials 
insisted that residents around pilgrim would have adequate 
protection in an emergency based on current plans

nine frenchmen held hostage in iraq were 
released in baghdad on wednesday and arrived in jordan with the 
private french group that secured their release 
french president francois mitterrand meanwhile arrived in abu 
dhabi the first stop on his twoday persian gulf visit to meet 
regional leaders and inspect frances troops 
his arrival came just hours after the nine former hostages 
arrived in amman aboard a regularly scheduled iraqi airways flight 
i am very happy that i have been released but a lot of people 
remain in iraq and kuwait said jeanyves bobin who had been 
detained in kuwait we hope they can be freed soon and that all 
things will develop toward a peaceful solution 
the nine who received their exit visas from iraq on tuesday 
were to return to france later wednesday french foreign ministry 
officials at ammans airport said 
iraq agreed to release the hostages during a visit by a 
fivemember french delegation headed by gilles munier who heads 
the private association for frenchiraqi friendship 
he called the hostages release a generous gesture by iraqi 
president saddam hussein and appealed for a softening of frances 
hardline policy toward baghdad since iraqs aug 2 invasion of 
kuwait 
munier is a member of the national front the ultraconservative 
french political party headed by jeanmarie le pen diplomatic 
sources in baghdad said le pen himself might visit iraq to seek the 
release of more frenchmen 
about 300 french nationals are among the thousands of westerners 
being held in iraq and kuwait to deter any attack by the usled 
military forces in the persian gulf region 
the release came just two days after iraq said it was willing to 
hold contacts with the french government in an attempt to resolve 
the crisis peacefully 
mitterrand suggested last week at the united nations that the 
resolution of the gulf crisis might be followed by initiatives to 
solve the problems of lebanon and the palestinians 
but mitterrand has reiterated the wests insistence that iraq 
withdraw from kuwait and free all hostages before negotiations take 
place 
mitterrands visit to the middle east was the first by a western 
leader with forces stationed in the region to protect saudi arabia 
and other gulf states from iraq 
after meeting leaders and reviewing french troops in abu dhabi 
he was to visit saudi arabia for talks with king fahd and possibly 
visit ground troops deployed at a forward staging area in the 
kingdom 
france is beefing up its ground forces to 4000 men in abu dhabi 
and saudi arabia including a regiment of foreign legionnaires 
france now has 13000 men plus a dozen warships in the region or 
on their way the largest overseas deployment of french troops 
since the algerian war 
mitterrand said sept 6 that he intended to visit the gulf it 
was the same day he announced a major increase in french forces in 
the region in response to a raid by iraqi troops on the french 
ambassadors residence in kuwait

the case of five slain college students 
remains a massive whodunit that may not be solved any time 
soon the areas chief state prosecutor says 
about 150 members of a joint task force are still at work 
trying to learn who was responsible for the late august killings 
in which one victim was decapitated state attorney len register 
told the gainesville sun for an article published wednesday 
it might take a lot longer than we hoped register said 
he said the case is still wide open and the suspect list remains 
fluid 
occasionally well pick up some suspects and weve been able 
to eliminate other suspects register said without naming any 
either way 
a fair inference is that this is still a massive whodunit 
this is not to say that were not making progress he said 
the task force is following up about 5000 tips logged in since 
the murders he said 
register revealed few details taskforce members say they dont 
want to release information that might be needed for a successful 
prosecution 
register also refused to talk about laboratory tests he said 
700 items from crime scenes and searches are being analyzed by the 
florida department of law enforcement 
sources told the sun last week that lab tests failed to place 
suspect edward lewis humphrey at the three crime scenes and pointed 
to someone else 
humphrey jailed in lieu of 1 million bail on a charge he beat 
his grandmother goes on trial monday in melbourne on that charge 
register said investigators have not ruled out the possibility 
that more than one person committed the crimes but he seemed to 
put no emphasis on that theory 
i think it would be irresponsible if we close out any 
scenario he said 
increased police patrols will continue and gainesville residents 
should maintain safety measures he said 
college is a carefree time in your life and under these 
circumstances that makes it a dangerous situation register 
said 
the bodies of the five college students were found in their 
offcampus apartments aug 2628

a republican candidate for the state 
house says women who seek multiple abortions should have to justify 
their plans before a panel and should be publicly humiliated in 
newspapers 
if you had five abortions then we will do something to make 
sure everyone in the world knows youve had five abortions said 
robert bechta a candidate for the house who runs a home security 
business in stafford 
under bechtas plan women who exceed a certain number of 
abortions would have to explain their actions before a medical 
panel such cases would also be publicized in newspapers even if 
the state had to pay for the space bechta said 
public degradation i think would probably be the best way 
of deterring people from having multiple abortions he said 
bechtas opponent democratic incumbent john d mordasky 
opposes all abortions except in cases of rape incest or risk to 
the mothers life 
abortion rights activists were angered by bechtas proposals 
of all the antiabortion tactics weve heard about in the last 
five years this one takes the cake for being the most outrageous 
and is almost comical if it werent so serious said alice 
kirkman a spokeswoman for the national abortion federation in 
washington dc 
it sounds like the romanian truth squads she said

democratic gubernatorial candidate ann 
richards criticized republican clayton williams offer to place his 
holdings in a blind trust if elected governor 
his sudden interest in distancing himself from his personal 
businesses is nothing more than a cynical gesture to divert 
attention from the very serious charges of insurance fraud that 
have been made against his bank said mary beth rogers richards 
campaign manager 
the williams campaign called richards criticism rank 
hypocrisy 
williams spokesman gordon hensley said richards supporters 
urged williams to place his 100 million business empire into a 
blind trust and then when he agreed they criticized him 
several state agencies are scrutinizing williams claydesta 
national bank of midland for allegedly requiring customers to buy 
expensive credit life insurance to get car loans williams has 
dismissed the probes as politically motivated 
williams defended his proposed blind trust under a blind trust 
officials give up control and knowledge of their businesses to 
separate their private and public affairs

with one hand and hitting me with the other telling me he loved 
me and smashing a fist into my eye marry me do you hear what 
im saying followed by another blow

bridgewater wants to scare away its 
birds just for old times sake 
the bridgewater historical society is starting a scarecrow 
contest it plans to hold annually and entrants can let their 
imaginations run wild said an organizer pat schramm 
the scarecrows can be the oldfashioned kind stuffed with hay 
propped up with a rake and topped off with a widebrimmed hat or 
the hightech versions made with wire framing and stuffed with 
nylon pantyhose 
the contest is aimed at reviving a piece of history and may even 
have some educational value for the towns younger residents 
schramm said 
a lot of younger children have never even seen a scarecrow 
schramm said 
mary allen president of the historical society said when she 
was growing up in bridgewater in the 1920s the scarecrow was a 
common sight put out by farmers to keep birds away from seeds and 
crops 
a rag often was draped around the scarecrow and tied in the 
middle leaving some of it hanging in the wind the flapping made 
it look just human enough to frighten away the birds she said 
the contest is open to the towns 1600 residents who have 
until oct 24 to display their scarecrows prizes will be given for 
various categories including the funniest and the scariest 
scarecrows

wednesday warned of retaliation against us targets if iraqi 
planes were hit with weapons under the un air embargo against 
iraq 
in a statement published by baghdads official aljumhuriya 
daily abul abbas called the air embargo the operation of air 
piracy by one state against another to serve its narrowminded 
interests 
the comments heightened fears that guerrilla factions linked to 
iraqi president saddam hussein would unleash a new terrorist 
campaign against the united states and its allies confronting iraq 
in the persian gulf 
abul abbas called the air embargo an american decision 
dictated to the international community the embargo is aimed at 
tightening the economic squeeze on iraq to withdraw from kuwait 
which baghdad invaded aug 2 
we will not permit such legislation to be implemented against 
our people and if any iraqi aircraft is confronted by such air 
piracy and should any damage be inflicted on iraqs civil aviation 
we will retaliate he said 
he said the un security council resolution was terroristic 
legislation which does not serve world peace 
abul abbas who heads the extremist palestine liberation front 
now based in baghdad did not specify what action would be taken 
but he appeared to be talking about hijacking or bombing us 
airliners since his warning concerned iraqi aircraft 
abbas whose real name is mohammed abbas is one of several 
radical palestinian leaders now based in iraq some have 
specialized in attacks on airliners and airports 
among them are george habash leader of the popular front for 
the liberation of palestine nayef hawatmeh of the marxist 
democratic front for the liberation of palestine and a group led 
by hussein mohammed umari whose nom de guerre is abu ibrahim 
abu nidals fatahrevolutionary council group is also reported 
to have moved back to iraq after a vicious internal feud in which 
hundreds of his men were killed 
abu nidal until recently reported to be in libya tops the 
worlds mostwanted list he has been blamed for scores of 
terrorist atrocities in recent years including the december 1985 
attacks on rome and vienna airports in which more than 20 people 
were killed 
the popular front was one of the first to begin hijacking 
ariliners in 1970 the group the second largest faction in the 
palestine liberation organization has about 1000 fighters 
the us state department saturday warned americans traveling 
abroad that they run the risk of iraqisponsored attacks 
national security adviser brent scowcroft said in washington 
friday that saddam was actively discussing things with 
terrorist leaders in baghdad 
a nato official said in brussels last week that saddam has 
provided the groups with the wherewithal to conduct terrorist 
operations

fatal motorcycle accidents have dropped 31 
percent since 1985 and 14 percent in the last year alone a trend 
due in part to the greater use of safety helmets the national 
highway traffic safety administration said wednesday 
other factors include a 19 percent reduction in motorcycle 
registrations over the last five years and greater emphasis on 
rider training the agency said 
but jerry ralph curry the agencys administrator said the 
improved figures represent progress not success 
half of motorcycle rider deaths involve alcohol a proportion 
that hasnt changed at all he said 
and he said more than 40 percent of the fatalities involve 
unlicensed or improperly licensed riders 
we still have a lot of work to do curry said 
motorcycle rider deaths numbered 4564 in 1985 dropped to 3661 
in 1988 and declined again to 3143 in 1989 the safety agency 
said 
it said that nationwide motorcycle registrations totaled 
5215941 but had dropped to 4218985 by last year

the house gave final congressional passage 
wednesday to legislation aimed at reversing the effects of a 
supreme court decision that allowed employers to limit job benefits 
for older workers 
the house voted 40617 to approve the same version of 
legislation passed by the senate on sept 24 
this is a great victory for older workers said sen howard 
metzenbaum chief sponsor of the senate version after the house 
completed action on the bill which now goes to the white house 
the supreme court held in a 1989 ruling that employee benefits 
were not afforded protection under the age discrimination in 
employment act of 1967 
the measure puts congress on record as taking the position that 
the high courts decision went against lawmakers intent when they 
passed the landmark age discrimination bill 23 years ago 
several lawmakers had been seeking to reverse the effects of the 
court ruling more than two years ago in a case pitting june betts 
of cincinnati against the employees retirement system of ohio 
at 61 ms betts a speech pathologist in hamilton county ohio 
was disabled with alzheimers disease she was denied disability 
retirement because she was over 60 the ruling denied her an 
additional 200 a month

cancellation notices havent gone out yet but 
nbcs ferris bueller and cbs earth force are on the 
hit list and abcs cop rock has been pencilled in an analyst 
said wednesday 
of the new series aired so far in the new season nbcs fresh 
prince of bel air has the most promise said richard kostrya a 
senior vice president of the j walter thompson advertising agency 
it wouldnt want to call it a hit but its the strongest of 
the new entries he said in an interview 
the fall season is just 2 weeks old and it will take a few weeks 
more to see how viewing patterns evolve he said 
the ac nielsen co ratings for last week declared abcs 
americas funniest people the highestrated new show it 
finished at 13th in the weekly rankings the rest ranged from 
middlelevel to the nielsen cellar 
fresh prince finished in 26th place it was followed by cbs 
uncle buck and abcs married people which tied for 37th 
place 
cbs the trials of rosie oneill which placed 40th is 
losing its monday audience leadin from designing women and may 
have to be transferred said kostrya 
the new and old lineup of the fox network is very very 
disappointing he said the new includes shows on the bottom of 
the ratings rung foxs dea haywire the mark 
frostdavid lynch effort american chronicles and glory 
days 
based on his analysis of viewing trends so far he said likely 
candidates for an early ax by the big three networks include nbcs 
bueller and hull high and cbs earth force and 
uncle buck 
abcs radical cop rock which mixes music with drama was 
56thranked in ratings in its premiere last week 
its too early to make a call on that showing kostrya said but 
it appears in trouble because it got a generally older audience 
than advertisers usually seek the kind of audience a show gets is 
a major factor he added 
although tv writers focus on the number of households tuned to 
shows each week he said advertisers care most about the 
demographics of the audience watching the programs viewers age 
sex incoms education and so on 
the key demographic is an audience whose members range in 
age from 18 to 49 he said 
although abc is third in overall prime time ratings for the 
young season he said they clearly are the number one network in 
the key demographic

the state of israel should be moved to 
europe so that europeans pay the price for past antisemitic 
persecution libyan leader col moammar ghadafy said wednesday 
the statement read to the un general assembly in arabic by 
libyan foreign minister jadallah azouz eltalhy said the land 
presently occupied by israel should become a homeland for 
palestinians 
the establishing of the jewish state in palestine was a 
revenge against nazism which tortured the jews in europe and the 
reaction against it according to a translation of the statement 
however nazism came to an end if the world is 
sympathizing with the jews against their persecutors in the past 
europe is responsible for that and it should pay the price of that 
by establishing a state for the jewish people he said 
the jewish character of the jewish state in palestine should 
come to an end if the world is serious in establishing peace over 
the land the statement continued then this requires the 
nations of the world to withdraw their recognition of the state 
and to make the state of palestine democratic without regard to 
the religion of its inhabitants

us senate candidate david duke who 
once burned crosses to denounce blacks is now asking for their 
help claiming sen bennett johnston has led you down the blind 
alley of poverty crime and human misery 
im not your enemy the former ku klux klan leader said in a 
30minute television fireside chat broadcast for the first time 
tuesday night 
your real enemies are liberals like bennett johnston who have 
the assumption blacks cant compete with whites and must be given 
preferential treatment and must be judged by lower standards 
johnston said at a news conference wednesday he didnt want to 
dignify dukes attack because hes not responsible for what duke 
says he just gets up and makes wild charges 
during the past two weeks the campaign has been waged almost 
completely on television since the race heated up during the 
summer the two candidates have spent almost 2 million much of it 
on tv and radio 
the primary is saturday under the unique louisiana system all 
candidates run on the same ballot regardless of party if no one 
gets more than half the vote the top two go into a runoff on nov 
6 
duke 40 is running as a republican without the partys 
endorsement the big question is whether he will poll enough votes 
to force johnston 58 a democrat into a runoff three other 
candidates also remain in the race 
the most recent poll taken by the university of new orleans 
about three weeks ago found that johnston had slipped from 48 
percent to 46 percent duke remained at 21 percent and ben bagert 
the official gop nominee remained far behind at 8 percent the 
undecided vote had increased to 20 percent with the rest refusing 
to answer questions 
duke also at a news conference wednesday said he expected to 
get at least 40 percent of the vote and force johnston into a 
runoff 
ironically many of bagerts fellow republicans are urging votes 
for johnston to keep duke out of a runoff 
democratic gov buddy roemer urged voters tuesday to shun duke 
by reelecting johnston he said a strong showing by duke would 
send the wrong signal to the nation and deter the states economic 
development 
johnston an 18year incumbent has spent much of his time 
recently in washington for the budget debate while out of the 
state he relied mostly on brief tv spots assailing dukes past as 
a klansman depicting him as a neonazi and outright liar 
some commercials show old film of duke in his klan robes in 
front of a burning cross saluting like a nazi 
duke who called the burning cross ad cowardly used his 
30minute program to apologize for what he calls the stupid 
mistakes of his youth 
on tuesday michael wahlder an alexandria lawyer and a 
republican one of three lesser known candidates dropped out of 
the race and urged bagert to do the same 
two other political unknowns both democrats remain in the 
race 
many prominent republicans especially on the national level 
have urged party members to vote for johnston to avoid a runoff 
between the incumbent and duke that would be an embarrassment to 
the gop 
on wednesday eight republican senators from other states urged 
reelection of johnston as a repudiation of what they said was 
dukes racism antisemitism and hatred 
all of us would be embarrassed and mortified to have to serve 
in the united states senate with david duke masquerading as a 
republican said sen john danforth rmo 
kelly johnston deputy political director of the republican 
senate campaign committee said a runoff between johnston and duke 
would be the worst possible thing that could happen to us it 
would allow democrats across the nation to link any republican in 
the november general election to duke she said 
sen ted stevens ralaska attended a news conference recently 
with johnston urging bagert to drop out and throw his support to 
the democrat 
bagert a state legislator since 1968 changed to the gop after 
the last election and was urged by the party to run against 
johnston 
the national gop drive to support johnston is treachery 
said bagert who was endorsed by president bush these georgetown 
swells with their lunches on pewter plates decided they could 
sacrifice the louisiana gop and renege on their commitment to me 
in addition to the candidates ads the louisiana coalition 
against racism and nazism is running an antiduke ad a parody of 
the jeopardy game show in which questions deal with dukes 
past 
ktaltv in shreveport stopped running the ad tuesday after 
receiving an anonymous bomb threat

thousands of leftist radicals marched through 
central berlin on wednesday throwing stones smashing windows and 
pelting police with paint to express their opposition to german 
unity 
more than 20000 people marched from a square in the western 
part of the city to a large square in the east side 
the theme of the march was that united germany was experiencing 
a rise in nationalism and racism many of the radicals were 
demanding that the german state be abolished entirely 
the newly combined berlin police force dispatched hundreds of 
law enforcement officials to alexanderplatz the large square east 
of the brandenburg gate that is a favorite place for protests 
about 15 to 20 youths broke off from the main group and rampaged 
through alexanderplatz they pummeled passersby and demolished an 
outdoor stand selling clothing 
thousands of riot police flanked the protest march and sealed 
off an adjacent street where a large group was chanting germany 
go away germany go to pieces never again germany 
the group was prevented form entering alexanderplatz where huge 
festivities were going on to celebrate the unification of the two 
german states

requirements that industry report toxic 
chemical releases will force polluters to reduce emissions but the 
first two years of data show little decline in pollution the 
environmental protection agency said wednesday 
the epa in an analysis of the toxic inventory reports for 1987 
and 1988 said that while factories reported a 10 percent 
statistical drop in toxic chemical releases the largest part of the 
decline was from changes in reporting 
for example some materials that are normally recycled were 
reported as releases in 1987 but not in 1988 for the facilities 
reporting the largest decline in pollution between the two years 
at least twothirds of the reduction was due to paper changes 
the epa said spot checks showed the industry reports were 
generally accurate but that thousands of facilities may still not 
be reporting releases as required by law 
the epa estimated that in 1987 as many as onethird of the 
companies or about 10000 that were required to make reports 
failed to do so the chemical industry had the highest reporting 
record with 88 percent compliance while the apparel printing and 
publishing industries had the lowest compliance record the agency 
said 
although the agency does not have compliance data for 1988 epa 
and industry officials suggested compliance was likely to be 
greater because 1987 was the first year the reporting law went into 
effect and some companies may not have been aware of it 
the findings were among an array of conclusions reached by epa 
officials in an analysis of two toxic chemical release statistics 
previously made public 
industry according to the reports submitted to the epa and 
announced in april released nearly 46 billion pounds of toxic 
chemicals into the air water and on land in 1988 
in 1987 the first year the figures were compiled the total was 
nearly 5 billion pounds 
among the other epa conclusions some of which had been reported 
previously were 
texas and louisiana accounted for nearly a fourth of all toxic 
releases and transfers of toxic materials to disposal sites and 50 
facilities accounted for 36 percent of these chemicals 
cancercausing chemicals account for about 8 percent of the 
total the most frequently released carcinogen 115 million pounds 
in 1988 was dichloromethane used as an industrial solvent and 
paint stripper 
among the 25 chemicals most widely emitted seven are 
considered to be highly toxic they are ammonia carbon 
disulfide chlorine zinc copper manganese and zinc compounds 
five percent more facilities submitted toxic release data in 
1988 and in 1987 mainly because more plants came under the 
jurisdiction of the reporting law in 1988 a total of 19763 
indstrial plants submitted reports the requirement covers plants 
emitting at least 50000 pounds of chemicals 
epa administrator william k reilly said he expects that the 
annual publication of toxic release data will push polluters to 
reduce toxic chemical releases the 1989 reports have not been 
tabulated 
these data which are available to any citizen should be 
considered to be among the most important weapons in efforts to 
combat pollution reilly said 
a number of chemical companies including some of the nations 
largest have said they are pushing for dramatic reductions in 
toxic releases in the coming years clean air legislation nearing 
completion in congress also requires such reductions

serbs manning a roadblock wounded 
two police near knin a town in the center of the conflict between 
serbs and croats yugoslavias two largest ethnic groups tanjug 
news agency said wednesday 
serb leaders are threatening to use force and to ally themselves 
with serbs in other republics if croatia doesnt give in to their 
demands for full autonomy developments that could plunge this 
volatile balkan nation into a civil war 
in slovenia to the north officials said they would use all 
means to resist any move by the yugoslav military to regain 
command over the regions home guard 
tens of thousands of slovene reservists were available to 
prevent any attempt by yugoslav army units to reassert federal 
control janez jansa slovenias defense minister told reporters 
in the state capital of ljubljana 
the slovenian legislature voted last week to transfer the 
states territorial defense militia up to now under federal 
command to local authorities 
yugoslavias state presidency said monday it would block 
slovenias move and ordered the federal military to resist any 
changes in the command structure of slovenias home guard 
the collective presidency made up of representatives from each 
of the countrys six republics and two provinces is the highest 
body in the land and also is in charge of the armed forces 
it demanded on tuesday that croatia withdraw its special 
riotpolice units from towns where members of the serb minority 
seized an estimated 500 automatic weapons and handguns from police 
armories 
tanjug quoted the presidency as saying the situation in many 
areas with a mixed national population has seriously deteriorated 
and is threatening to result in intranationalist conflicts with 
tragic consequences 
the knin shooting came when two policemen were stopped late 
tuesday night at a roadblock about three miles from knin about 125 
miles south of zagreb 
the rifletoting civilian guards demanded that the officers 
surrender arms the police refused as they tried to leave the 
guards fired and wounded them tanjug said it reported the 
injuries were not lifethreatening 
an explosion in knin late tuesday wrecked a croatian news stand 
a witness reported no one was injured 
serbia is yugoslavias largest republic and croatia the 
secondlargest 
the rivalry between serbs and croats dates from yugoslavias 
founding in 1918 and heightened dramatically after the centerright 
government ousted communists last spring in croatias first free 
elections in over 45 years 
the serbs accuse the new government in zagreb of discriminating 
against them the croatian government says the unrest was 
orchestrated by communistgoverned serbia to undermine democracy in 
croatia and rally popular support for serbias hardline leaders 
serbs comprise about 10 percent of croatias 5 million people 
serbias 14 main opposition parties said wednesday they would 
boycott the regions first free elections in more than 50 years 
unless the communists agreed to equal access to the staterun news 
media and other conditions 
if they dont want serbia to remain a sad singleparty 
dictatorship in todays democratic europe the communists should 
call off elections scheduled for dec 9 said a statement released 
by the opposition coalition 
the communists should then negotiate with the opposition and a 
democratic electoral law would follow the statement said

an environmental group charged wednesday that 
oil companies are destroying ecuadors rain forests with toxic 
waste discharges and oil pipeline spills amounting to more than was 
spilled from the exxon valdez 
the natural resources defense council especially criticized 
texaco inc and asked it to establish a 50 million fund to 
undertake emergency cleanups and establish environmental controls 
to prevent further contamination of the forests 
the company bears at a minimum a moral responsibility to make 
appropriate reparations the council said in a report on its 
18month onsite investigation of the impact of oil development on 
ecuadors 31 million acres of tropical rain forest 
texaco spokesman dave dixon said the company was not given a 
copy of the report and therefore could not comment on specific 
charges but he added in all its operations texacos policy is 
to operate in accordance with the highest standards of 
environmental conservation 
the report was released at a news conference attended by robert 
f kennedy jr an attorney for the group who traveled to ecuador 
in july 
we saw things that in 20 years of going to latin america i 
have never seen and in seven years of practicing environmental 
law in this state and being involved in some of the worst toxic 
sites in the state i have never seen kennedy said 
in contaminated areas of the forests children have pus coming 
out of their eyes from bathing in streams animals are dead 
adults have rashes covering their bodies he said 
the ecuadoran government has recorded about 30 major oil spills 
from the transecuadorian pipeline from 1972 until october 1989 
with an estimated loss of 168 million gallons of oil according to 
the natural resources council during that time the pipeline was 
operated by texaco it said 
the exxon valdez spilled about 108 million gallons of oil into 
the prince william sound in alaska 
the pipeline is particularly vulnerable to spills because it 
crosses a major andean fault in march 1987 earthquakes caused 
some 59 million gallons of oil to spew into the coca river 
ecuadors rain forests also are being contaminated by poisonous 
wastes from hundreds of oil wells in the region the environmental 
group charged more than 4 million gallons of these wastes are 
dumped untreated into unlined pits every day and seep into streams 
and aquifers it said 
cleanup efforts are primitive at best according to the 
council 
kennedy said he saw inhabitants of the cuyabeno wildlife reserve 
cleaning up an oil spill by using their bare hands to scoop oil 
into plastic bags which were then buried in pits 
the council is the first environmental group to examine the 
impact of oil development on rain forests said s jacob scherr 
director of the councils international program traditionally he 
said environmentalists have worried about the destruction of 
tropical forests by slashandburn farmers logging mining and 
road building 
the environmental group also urged conoco a subsidiary of du 
pont co to cancel its plans to drill oil in the region saying it 
would risk unnecessary and irreparable injury to the indigenous 
huaorani people 
ed davies president and general manager of conoco ecuador said 
in a telephone interview from quito ecuador that the company was 
working closely with the huaorani who number only 1580 to ensure 
the oil development does not have a negative impact on them

an allwhite jury wednesday 
convicted a record store owner of obscenity for selling a sexually 
explicit album by the black rap group 2 live crew that had been 
banned by a federal judge 
the panel of five women and one man took only 2 hours to return 
the verdict against charles freeman 31 the misdemeanor conviction 
carries a possible oneyear jail sentence and 1000 fine broward 
county judge paul backman set sentencing for nov 2 
im absolutely stunned by the verdict defense attorney 
bruce rogow said 
freeman denounced the jurors as unfair and ignorant of the black 
community the departing jurors had no comment 
i felt that the jury paid very close attention to the 
evidence said prosecutor leslie robson they came back with a 
verdict that spoke the truth 
the miamibased rap group and its album as nasty as they wanna 
be have been at the center of a first amendment dispute since 
june 6 when a fort lauderdale federal judge ruled their lyrics 
obscene the lyrics have been criticized as promoting violence 
against women 
the federal judges ruling banned the sale of the album in three 
south florida counties but opened a flood of legal cases around 
the country against the album shortly after the decision sales of 
the 2yearold album nationwide approached 2 million 
its the first time in us musical history that a piece of 
work has been found to be obscene said trish heimers 
spokeswoman for the recording industry association of america a 
washingtonbased trade association for us record companies 
there are not small steps toward censorship and i would most 
certainly characterize this as censorship 
in february a record store owner in alexander city ala was 
acquitted of obscenity for selling the album 
is this america asked robyn blumner executive director of 
the state american civil liberties union chapter these things 
happen in totalitarian societies where certain ideas may not be 
expressed upon penalty of law 
broward sheriff nick navarro who led the case greeted the 
verdict by saying the system worked this was never a case of 
censorship but rather one man flouting the law the first amendment 
is alive and well 
and donald wildmon founder of the conservative american family 
association based in tupelo miss saw the conviction as a sign of 
a national trend against obscenity and pornography theres 
definitely a shift in attitudes in america about this kind of 
trash 
freeman who is black was arrested two days after the ruling 
when he sold the album to undercover police officers at his ec 
record store in fort lauderdale 
three members of the rap group later were charged with 
performing obscene material at a nightclub show in nearby 
hollywood their trial is set oct 9 
rogow who also represents the band members promised an appeal 
on grounds that the jury pool did not represent the community and 
that evidence of adult videotapes and magazines available in the 
county was improperly excluded 
what you have is a jury that could not represent all of 
broward county he said certainly it was not a crosssection 
of the county 
the jury doesnt represent my community freemanshouted to 
reporters as he left the courthouse its unfair the jury was 
all white they dont know where ec records is they dont know a 
goddamned thing about the ghetto 
2 live crew was scheduled to perform wednesday night at a club 
in niagara falls ny 
david hobbs the bands disc jockey said the controversy would 
not force the group to alter its style we feel that we have to 
do what we have to do and thats make the same records that weve 
been making hobbs said 
if it wouldnt have been us it would have been somebody 
else hobbs said at a news conference someones always going 
to be the target it just happened to get pointed at our 
direction 
jury instructions followed a us supreme court standard saying 
material could be found obscene if it has no artistic merit and 
appeals solely to prurient interests a tape of the disputed record 
was played for the jury 
obscenity is what this is prosecutor robson said waving a 
cassette tape before the jury in her closing arguments 
the trial was the first jury test of us district judge jose 
gonzalezs ruling that the groups raunchy lyrics were obscene 
alternate juror sheryl salomon who sat through the 2day trial 
but was not needed for deliberations said after her dismissal that 
she would have acquitted freeman 
i was very offended by it especially the lyrics but i have 
to question whether there is no artistic value she said its 
music its still music 
legal arguments focused on first amendment freespeech 
protection but race has been an underlying issue 
defense attorneys objected to the makeup of the 35member jury 
pool which included only one black whose name was not picked when 
a dozen names were drawn at random as the final group of 
prospective jurors 
one persons vulgarity is another persons art rogow said 
its never easy living with the first amendment a person can say 
terrible things violently against the government against the 
family against women and against men and its all within the 
parameters of the first amendment 
the first amendment doesnt mean you can say what you want to 
whom you want and when you want because theres responsibilities 
along with those rights robson said one of the things you 
cant do is you cant sell obscene material

belgium has about 20 military advisers in rwanda and more than 
1600 belgians live there the central african nation gained its 
independence from belgium in 1962 
the invasion began sunday led by fred rwigyema a member of 
rwandas tutsi ethnic group who has become the deputy commander of 
ugandas army since being exiled there years ago 
the tutsi group lost to the rival hutu group in a power struggle 
about 30 years ago an estimated 87000 tutsi refugees live in 
southwestern uganda and some have gained senior posts in the 
ugandan government especially the army 
rwandese troops wednesday appeared to halt the advance of the 
rebel force seeking to overthrow the government said a western

iraqi president saddam hussein toured the 
streets of kuwait city on wednesday and visited with soldiers who 
promised to defend the invaded country against all evil 
attempts to dislodge them 
in his first reported visit to occupied kuwait saddam found a 
capital that glittered with pride at his presence the official 
iraqi news agency said monitored in nicosia 
saddam toured the streets of kuwait which appeared 
flourishing after its return to the mother homeland saddam has 
annexed kuwait and proclaimed it iraqs 19th province 
the visit appeared to be an effort to counter reports of turmoil 
overtaking the city since iraqs aug 2 invasion 
on his arrival at the center of the city of kuwait the 
president presided over two meetings of the military commanders and 
a number of officials attended by mr ali hassan almajeed 
minister of the local administration the iraqi news agency said 
almajeed a cousin of saddam has cabinet rank as minister of 
local governments maintaining longtime links with iraqs secret 
police he oversaw iraqs poisongas attacks on ethnic kurds in the 
north of the country in the fall of 1988 that reportedly killed 
thousands of people 
the news agency said that after the meetings with the officials 
saddam made a tour during which he met a number of units of the 
iraqi brave armed forces and talked to the fighters 
the troops confirmed to saddam their everreadiness for 
sacrifice for iraq and the arab nation and defeating all evil 
attempts to desecrate our sacred land the news agency said 
refugees fleeing kuwait have said that stores and shops have 
been pillaged there have been reports of summary executions of 
resistance fighters many refugees said they had feared to leave 
their homes 
president bush has cited such reports in saying that the united 
nations might have to provide more action to dislodge iraq if 
economic sanctions fail to do so military action has been 
suggested 
the presidential visit wednesday also may be construed in the 
west as an effort by saddam to stake a further claim on kuwait 
western leaders have said repeatedly that iraq must withdraw kuwait 
before any serious dialogue can begin

feinstein criticized sen pete wilson on wednesday for failing to 
vote on the confirmation of supreme court justice david souter

important judicial appointment of the decade and said it was 
arrogant of her republican opponent to skip that and other major 
senate votes wilson was the only senator who missed the souter

confirmation wilson said in explaining why he didnt interrupt his 
campaigning in california to return to washington on tuesday

rights said fertik on the most important abortion rights vote 
of the decade he didnt even bother to show up fertik predicted 
souter will provide the crucial fifth vote to overturn roe v wade 
the supreme court decision legalizing abortion

the expected vote on the deficit reduction compromise of president 
bush and congressional leaders 
wilson and feinstein refused to take a stand on the deficit 
reduction proposal 
wilson said its undoubtedly true that its the best plan 
that can be negotiated at this time but added that he is not 
crazy about it because of the tax increases 
wilson said he would stay in california campaigning and 
preparing for the debate unless his vote is essential

deficit reduction program in a decade 
on the other hand its protecting the rich by skewing 
tax increases to hit the middle class hardest she added

foreign embassies trying to hold out in 
kuwait are caving in one by one to iraqs siege tactics and one 
european foreign minister said he doubted any foreign missions 
could remain beyond this week 
after invading kuwait iraq ordered the embassies closed and 
many shut down a few weeks after the aug 24 deadline 
but many countries including the united states and britain 
have defied the order and kept their embassies open with skeletal 
staffs 
sixteen diehard embassies remain open despite tough conditions 
most have had their electricity and water cut and many are 
surrounded by iraqi soldiers and tanks their communications and 
food lines severed 
bowing to the hardships spain and south korea last week 
withdrew their remaining diplomats from kuwait city 
spain gave as its reason the superior power of iraqs army 
which surrounded the spanish embassy in the days prior to the 
charge daffaires departure thursday madrid nevertheless said it 
considers its embassy open in principle and rejects iraqs 
annexation of kuwait 
the south korean foreign ministry said it temporarily closed 
its embassy because of the deteriorated situation 
belgian foreign minister mark eyskens said saturday in new york 
that most european embassies still open in kuwait would probably 
have to close this week 
there are fewer than 10 diplomats at the us embassy according 
to a state department official who refused to go into more detail 
the besieged americans are cut off but have enough food and 
water said the official he would not estimate how long they can 
hold out under the very trying circumstances 
he would not comment on earlier reports that the americans were 
using the embassy swimming pool for drinking water 
the british embassy has only four staff remaining including the 
ambassador but two will be leaving soon via baghdad to conserve 
supplies for the other two according to a foreign office 
spokesman 
he declined to comment on the food supply although he said 
staff at the embassy are in good spirits eyskens said last 
week that the british embassy appeared to have more plentiful 
supplies than others in kuwait 
the french have about a halfdozen diplomats in kuwait 
according to the foreign ministry in paris 
theres no problem were holding on a spokeman said 
simply the french government has been reluctant to give details 
about french citizens who remain in kuwait they have good 
morale and there hasnt been any particular problem recently 
the spokesman said 
italy has only two diplomats in kuwait who are surviving with 
their supplies they eat canned food foreign ministry 
spokesman vittorio surdo said tuesday he said morale was high but 
the pressure is increasing 
the belgian ambassador and his chief aide along with a 
nondiplomatic belgian couple and their three children in the 
belgian embassy are all right but their food and water are running 
low 
a foreign ministry source said he assumed some supplies were 
getting to the embassy but it was becoming increasingly difficult 
probably forcing the embassy to close soon 
the dutch may be the best off among the europeans theres 
lots of everything including food and drink and no iraqi 
soldiers outside the mission a government spokeswoman said 
tuesday the ministry knows of no unusual hardships she said 
the five gulf cooperation council countries besides kuwait 
saudi arabia bahrain qatar united arab emirates and oman have 
refused the iraqi order to close their embassies insisting that 
their diplomats remain accredited to the deposed government of 
kuwait 
all but the saudi arabian missions are known to be staffed but 
diplomatic sources in the persian gulf said this week that 
lowranking saudi diplomats are there to underscore saudi support 
for kuwait 
the philippine embassy was reported two weeks ago by a 
philippine journalist who visited kuwait to be crammed with some 
3000 nationals caught when iraqi troops swarmed into the oilrich 
emirate foreign ministry officials in manila say they do not know 
how many remain but say the embassy still has electricity and 
water 
indonesias embassy is not closed although jakarta has 
withdrawn its diplomats and left the building under the care of a 
local guardian whose food comes from jordan or from the indonesian 
embassy in baghdad according to the indonesian foreign ministry 
other embassies that have refused the order to close include 
canada luxembourg senegaland germany 
kuwaits cabinetinexile operating out of saudi arabia issued 
a statement tuesday condemning baghdad for its treatment of 
embassies and diplomats and praising the honorable stand of 
those who remained

certainly characterize this as censorship she said 
band members appeared at a news conference before their show at 
a niagara falls ny nightclub but they would not discuss the 
case or their own upcoming obscenity trial in miami in any detail 
we feel that we have to do what we have to do and thats make 
the same records that weve been making said david hobbs the 
groups disc jockey thats it he said 
hobbs who spoke for the group said the musicians feel they 
were just a convenient foil for the antiobscenity movement 
if it wouldnt have been us it would have been somebody 
else he said someones always going to be the target it just 
happened to get pointed in our direction 
the groups lyrics include sexually explicit language and have 
been criticized as promoting violence against women a charge hobbs 
rejected the us supreme court has ruled that material could be 
found obscene if it has no artistic merit and appeals solely to 
prurient interests 
broward sheriff nick navarro who led the prosecution case 
greeted the verdict by saying the system worked this was never a 
case of censorship but rather one man flouting the law the first 
amendment is alive and well 
donald wildmon founder of the conservative american family 
association based in tupelo miss saw the conviction as a sign of 
a national trend against obscenity and pornography theres 
definitely a shift in attitudes in america about this kind of 
trash 
heimers argued that a recording should be judged for both 
musical and lyrical content and by the very nature of having 
both it cant be deemed as obscene the music no matter what the 
lyrics is not without artistic value 
she said the music industry was prepared to assist freeman with 
financial and legal help freemans lawyer promised to appeal the 
misdemeanor conviction which carries a possible oneyear jail 
sentence and 1000 fine 
the precedent has been set that its ok to find music obscene 
and that is wrong heimers said any country that allows the 
kkk ku klux klan to have a tv show on public access should have 
the 2 live crew available 
obviously were shocked and dismayed over many elements of the 
decision and theres not much in life that shocks me said 
michael greene president of the national academy of recording arts 
amp sciences in burbank calif 
greene criticized the extremely narrow view that the judge and 
jury exhibited in convicting freeman and questioned how an 
allwhite predominantly female jury can determine what does and 
does not constitute artistic merit in a primarily innercity black 
music form 
today the victim is a little guy who sells records but were 
sure the target is a black form of music and freedom of 
expression greene said

liberal house democrats rebelled wednesday 
against the 500billion deficitreduction package as president 
bush and congressional leaders pushed hard for the plan on the eve 
of its first vote 
leading house democrats and republicans expressed confidence 
that both sides would round up a majority of votes by thursday 
when the full house plans to vote on an outline of the package of 
tax boosts and spending cuts 
that is my intuition that when the vote comes there will be a 
majority of both parties said house speaker thomas s foley 
dwash 
but bush foley and house minority leader robert michel rill 
worked furiously behind the scenes meeting privately with 
rankandfile members and dispatching top lieutenants to do the 
same democratic leadership aides speaking privately offered 
conflicting assessments of how worried they might be about the 
prospects 
democrats and republicans figured on wednesday nght they were 
each 40 votes short of what they need and that a considerable 
number of lawmakers remained uncommitted 
a number of liberal democrats said they would oppose the 
proposal complaining about its reliance on 60 billion in medicare 
cuts over five years and about the 11 billion in tax breaks it 
contains for small businesses 
to cut 60 billion from medicare means a lot of lowincome 
elderly are going to be faced with difficult outofpocket 
expenses said rep henry waxman dcalif these people didnt 
create the deficit 
after a day of white house lobbying republicans spokesman 
marlin fitzwater said the needed votes still were not in hand and 
declined to say how many votes the white house could muster 
bush kept close tabs on the results of lobbying efforts 
checking in with fitzwater at the end of the day for a reading of 
what the congress members were telling reporters fitzwater told 
him that most say they are considering it theyre listening and 
theyre sympathetic to the argument 
twentyseven more republicans met with bush at the white house 
the third straight day on which gop lawmakers were summoned by the 
president for his sales pitch one white house official called the 
operation the bush administrations biggest lobbying effort yet 
i was leaning against before now im firmly undecided said 
rep bob livingston rla after emerging from a meeting 
reps susan molinari and sherwood l boehlert both rny said 
they were more inclined to vote with the president after the 
meeting but they wanted an unpopular 2 cents per gallon home 
heating oil tax dropped 
it was not any arm twisting he based all his arguments on 
facts molinari said 
bush cancelled a weekend trip to his maine summer home to stay 
on top of the budget issue 
there comes a time when you have to simply make tough 
decisions give a little to get what is best for the country 
bush told reporters in a message clearly designed for congressional 
consumption 
he urged members of congress to vote for the package and then 
blame the president when they talk to voters 
meanwhile federal reserve chairman alan greenspan said at a 
congressional hearing that he supports the deficitreduction 
package greenspans views are important since supporters of the 
plan are looking to the federal reserve to lower interest rates to 
offset any negative economic effects 
the package would raise taxes on gasoline home heating oil 
alcohol tobacco expensive cars and other luxury items and on the 
incomes of the wealthy 
it would cut defense spending by close to 200 billion over the 
next five years while reducing spending on benefit programs by 105 
billion 
the heating oil provision was being fought by members of 
congress from northeastern states some of whom said that keeping 
it in could hurt support for the overall proposal 
on capitol hill liberal rep dale kildee dmich said he was 
lobbied by a rather pessimistic sounding foley 
he was really laboring hard for my vote said kildee who is 
leaning against the plan 
on the republican side no 3 house gop leader jerry lewis 
rcalif predicted a substantial victory for the plan a 
republican aide said 50 of the houses 176 republicans were now 
committed to vote for the package 
but opposition continued from conservatives unhappy with the 
plans 134 billion in new taxes and with spending cuts they 
consider insufficient rep newt gingrich the chambers no 2 
republican leader and a leading opponent who tuesday said bushs 
lobbying would ensure the packages success said wednesday he was 
no longer sure 
bush nn a televised address tuesday night asked americans to 
tell their congressional representatives they supported the plan 
but gingrich rga said ive had members walk up to me and 
say theyve gotten so many phone calls from their districts against 
the package that they dont know if they can stay with it 
senate leaders have been more confident about the proposals 
prospects there it was uncertain whether the senate would vote 
thursday or friday 
whatever the outcome in this weeks preliminary votes lawmakers 
from both sides said they would not vote for the deficitreduction 
package itself a vote expected in two weeks unless changes were 
made at a morning meeting of house democrats leaders begged the 
rankandfile members to vote yes on thursday and to see about 
alterations after that 
among the skeptics is house ways and means committee chairman 
dan rostenkowski dill who said the measures medicare cuts were 
too deep and its tax breaks for companies too generous republicans 
have said the tax benefits such as one that allows deductions for 
some money invested in small companies would help create jobs 
i can see a tax shelter boom and the only employment that 
will i think be created is a boom in taxshelter packaging said 
rostenkowski 
rostenkowski who said he has not decided how he will vote is 
one of the more influential members of the house his committee 
must approve the new levies tax changes and spending cuts

saddam hussein on wednesday made his first known visit to kuwait 
since iraq captured its oilrich neighbor aug 2 another neighbor 
iran said it would keep out of any military confrontation between 
iraq and usled multinational forces in the region 
elsewhere in the middle east visiting french president francois 
mitterrand japanese prime minister toshiku kaifu and soviet envoy 
yevgeny primakov all sought a peaceful solution to the persian gulf 
crisis 
but new terror threats emerged palestinian guerrilla leader 
abul abbas warned he would attack us aircraft if iraqi planes 
were hit with weapons as part of the un air embargo against iraq 
in washington bush administration officials told congress iraq 
is likely to remain a longterm threat and sales of billions of 
dollars in us weaponry to saudi arabia are crucial to a new 
regional coalition to balance that menace 
iraq facing an international force on its border with saudi 
arabia after invading kuwait suddenly made peace with iran last 
month after eight years of war and two years of deadlocked peace 
talks 
saddam wooed iran to side with him tehran joined world demands 
that iraq withdraw from kuwait but also urged the expulsion of 
foreign forces from the region 
on wednesday foreign minister ali akbar velayati said on tehran 
tv that iran wants a peaceful settlement and force should be the 
last possible resort for solving this crisis but iran will not 
participate in this in any way 
his remarks monitored in cyprus indicated iran was distancing 
itself from iraq following suggestions it could circumvent a 
usled embargo and send iraq food and medicine reports from 
washington said iraq also asked tehran to help export its embargoed 
oil 
the londonbased amnesty international meanwhile issued a report 
saying iraqi occupation troops tortured and executed scores of 
people in kuwait some for refusing to display pictures of saddam 
refugees have said stores and shops were pillaged and that iraq 
was out to dismantle kuwaiti institutions they reported summary 
executions of resistance fighters 
the iraqi news agency gave a different portrait it said saddam 
toured the streets of kuwait which appeared flourishing after 
its return to the mother homeland 
the news agency said saddam met with iraqi troops and presided 
over two meetings of military commanders iraq has annexed the 
emirate declaring it bahdads 19th province 
kuwait city glittered with pride at saddams visit said the 
agency monitored in cyprus 
mitterrand flew to the persian gulf for a twoday visit during 
which he planned to meet regional leaders and inspect french 
troops 
after he left paris the defense ministry announced france was 
sending eight mirage f1 fighter planes to qatar to protect that 
small country and the united arab emirates its neighbor 
his first stop was the emirates capital of abu dhabi 
he reached there hours after nine french nationals held hostage 
by iraq flew out of baghdad on an iraqi plane and arrived in amman 
jordan bound for paris 
they were accompanied by the chairman of the private french 
group that arranged their release iraq is believed to still hold 
about 300 other french nationals hostage as well as thousands of 
other westerners 
france now has 13000 men plus a dozen warships in the gulf 
region the largest overseas deployment of french troops since the 
algerian war 
primakov a mideast expert and close adviser to soviet president 
mikhail s gorbachev met king hussein and other senior jordanian 
officials on wednesday in amman he said he brought a letter for 
hussein that concerns efforts to find a settlement for the gulf 
crisis and other mideast problems 
the monarch has tried to play the role of mediator in the gulf 
crisis 
the soviet delegation was due to fly to baghdad thursday for 
talks with iraqi officials late wednesday however iraqi deputy 
premier taha yassin ramadan arrived in amman it was not known if 
this would change primakovs plans 
in new york soviet foreign minister eduard a shevardnadze said 
the delegation would like to meet saddam and that it also hoped to 
arrange normal conditions for withdrawal of the 5000 soviet 
citizens remaining in iraq 
before kuwazit was invaded the kremlin was baghdads main 
weapons supplier and france was its next largest supplier moscow 
however joined the united states in demanding iraqs withdrawal 
from kuwait which baghdad invaded in a dispute over land oil and 
money 
japans kaifu also arrived in the jordanian capital wednesday 
for talks with hussein on aid to jordan and on peaceful efforts to 
solve the crisis 
kaifu met wednesday night with crown prince hassan who briefed 
him on the economic losses jordan has sustained because of its 
adherence to the un embargo on iraq jordans largest trading 
partner 
kaifu said earlier in the day the second day of his weeklong 
middle east visit that japan would make more and stronger 
efforts to find a peaceful way out of the persian gulf crisis 
he is to meet in amman on thursday with iraqs vice president 
taha yassin ramadan shigeo takanaka deputy spokesman for japans 
foreign office said the iraqis requested the meeting 
he said kaifu plans to impose on mr ramadan the importance of 
solving the crisis in the gulf in accordance with un security 
council resolutions 
the resolutions demand withdrawal of iraqi forces from kuwait 
restoration of its ousted government and freedom for the thousands 
of western hostages in both countries they also impose air and sea 
embargoes on iraq 
on wednesday abul abbas who masterminded the 1985 hijacking 
of the italian liner achille lauro called the air embargo the 
operation of air piracy by one state against another to serve its 
narrowminded interests 
he acccused the united states of masterminding it and declared 
we will not permit such legislation to be implemented against our 
people and if any iraqi aircraft is confronted by such air piracy 
and should any damage be inflicted on iraqs civil aviation we 
will retaliate 
the threats came in a statement published by baghdads official 
aljumhuriya daily abul abbas who heads the extremist palestine 
liberation front did not specify what action would be taken but 
he appeared to be talking about hijacking or bombing us 
airliners

a federal judge said wednesday a 
fifthgrade teachers daily bible readings to her class violate the 
constitution and must be stopped 
us district judge john h moore ii granted a preliminary 
injunction sought by the american civil liberties union on behalf 
of the parents of a 9yearold at emma love elementary school in 
nearby nassau county 
they complained that teacher martha mitchell started each school 
day with a bible story and said prayers daily before lunch 
moore said he would set a hearing soon on a final injunction 
albeit that the defendants may have good motives the 
practices violate the constitution of the united states as 
interpreted by the supreme court the judge said 
the nassau county school boardbolstered by strong community 
support voted 50 on sept 27 to let mrs mitchell continue her 
biblestory readings which she said she used to settle down her 
class at the start of each day 
the parents donald and louise hatch said they have no personal 
objections to mrs mitchell or her teaching methods however they 
said their daughter should not be read bible stories in school 
we have been confident from the very beginning what the 
decision would be hatch said following the 30minute hearing 
wednesday what the nassau county school board has been doing 
clearly violates the freedom of religion 
attorney bill sheppard representing the hatches on behalf of 
the aclu said after the hearing everyone must obey the laws of 
the united states of america or well be a country without laws 
official lawlessness is the most repugnant 
school board attorney marshall wood who had the task of 
defending the board even after informing its members that their 
decision was a violation of the constitution told moore that the 
daily bible reading was not meant as religious instruction but as a 
means of calming the students 
mrs mitchell contends this the bible is a piece of 
literature wood said 
mrs mitchell 51 of fernandina beach did not attend the 
hearing she said earlier that she was overwhelmed by the issue 
i feel very humbled by the support i have received by the 
christian people who have come out and are willing to voice their 
feelings she said i never imagined this 
mrs mitchell a methodist said she has read bible stories to 
her schoolchildren throughout her 30year career 
superintendent craig marsh said the schools will abide by the 
judges ruling and will order all prayer and bible reading stopped 
i did not know it was going on until the hatches brought it 
up he said wednesday

the family of an 82yearold man who has been in 
a coma for six years removed his feeding tube wednesday after 
convincing a judge that he would not want to be kept alive by 
artificial means 
sidney greenspan has been comatose since suffering a stroke in 
1984 while stricken with alzheimers disease an progressive and 
irreversible neurological disorder 
his wife bella son howard and daughter marla turned to the 
legal system in 1988 to have his intravenous feeding tubes removed 
relatives said greenspan had expressed a desire to die if he ever 
lapsed into a vegetative state 
cook county circuit court judge richard dowdle consented in a 
ruling wednesday saying the evidence presented to him was clear 
and convincing that the ward if mentally able would refuse to 
continue the treatment 
in july the illinois supreme court had ordered dowdle to 
reconsider his 1988 refusal to allow the feeding tube removal 
the language of dowdles decision wednesday echoed a june ruling 
by the us supreme court upholding missouri guidelines that kept 
the parents of car accident victim nancy cruzan from having her 
tube feeding stopped the parents believed cruzan would not want to 
be kept alive but she did not leave a living will or other 
such evidence 
a neurologist dr allan burke testified last week that 
greenspan was in vegetative state and was getting worse 
burke said greenspan could not swallow or communicate with 
others exhibited only primitive responses to stimuli and 
would die in less than a week if intravenous feeding were cut off 
the feeding tube was removed by the family on wednesday 
afternoon at a north side nursing home where he is cared for said 
judy lewis the nursing homes director of admissions 
the family members his wife son and daughter were all in 
the room when the tubes were removed she said 
lewis said nursing home officials were not involved she did not 
know which family member removed the tube 
the judge also ordered that guardians try to feed greenspan 
orally after tubes are removed 
he refused to grant a stay requested by americans united for 
life a group opposing the removal of greenspans life support the 
group sought the stay to appeal the judges decision 
we reluctantly have decided not to appeal judge dowdles 
decision said spokesman paul linton although we strongly 
disagree with this finding we also recognize that such findings 
are seldom reversed on appeal 
doctors have testified that greenspan former owner of a chicago 
plumbing supply business lost his ability to swallow in 1985 
because of alzheimers disease and has been tubefed since then

civil aviation administration airline they said the pilot was 
allowed to handle the situation as he saw fit 
relatives of victims and foreign diplomats voiced anger and 
frustration that china was issuing a minimum of information on the 
worst reported air disaster in its history 
weve been moving around like a headless chicken nobody has 
told us where our relatives are a middleaged chinese man said 
early wednesday trying to get information from officials in 
canton we dont know whether they are alive or dead 
a woman seeking news of relatives said we dont think the 
government officials understand how we feel 
they spoke on the condition of not being identified 
the disaster comes as china is acting as host at its first major 
international sporting event the asian games security forces 
nationwide had been on alert to prevent incidents that might 
embarrass the government 
in beijing state council spokesman yuan mu called the hijacking 
a tragedy but said it wont have an adverse effect on the 
games 
an airport official quoted air traffic controllers as saying the 
pirate appeared confused about where he wanted to go first saying 
hong kong then taiwan

40 minutes before crashing 
one western survivor reported a cockpit struggle as the plane 
landed causing it to careen into the other jets other reports

hawaiis narrow limits on the filing of 
late income statements by lowincome workers on welfare were 
declared invalid wednesday by a federal appeals court 
hawaii cancels a months welfare benefits if a statement proving 
eligibility is filed late unless the applicant was ill or had 
trouble with the mails the 9th us circuit court of appeals said 
exceptions had to be broader under a federal law waiving the 
deadline for good cause 
the ruling allows a woman from waianae in oahu to keep 198 that 
the state sought to withhold in 1987 because she was a day late in 
filing her statement of earned income after her employer had 
refused to provide pay stubs hawaiis lawyer in the case said the 
decision had nationwide implications 
states that have restrictive definitions of good cause are on 
shaky grounds if the ruling stands said deputy attorney general 
thomas farrell 
farrell said no decision has been made on an appeal 
in the 21 ruling the court said congress intended the federal 
government to define good cause instead of leaving it to the 
states the court did not provide its own definition saying only 
that hawaiis was too narrow 
we felt under any definition of good cause it should 
encompass employers problems or any circumstances beyond the 
applicants control said john ishahara a lawyer for the legal 
aid society of hawaii 
the case involves federal laws encouraging welfare recipients to 
work by exempting a portion of their first four months wages and 
a monthly amount of work expenses from their income eligibility 
limits recipients must file forms with the welfare department by 
the sixth day of each month stating their job income 
regina vierra who has a child got her first months pay from a 
parttime job in october 1987 and was supposed to attach her pay 
verification to her november welfare eligibility form 
but the court said her employer turned down eight requests to 
provide pay stubs and vierra who could not read well was not 
told by her caseworker that she could verify her income without the 
stubs 
after her employer finally provided the stubs she filed the 
form one business day late under hawaiis definition of good 
cause for lateness adopted in 1984 the state refused to deduct 
a portion of her earnings from her income and denied her 198 check 
for a month because she did not fit the exceptions of illness or 
mail troubles she was paid the benefits conditionally however 
while she appealed the decision 
reversing a ruling by us district judge harold fong the 
appeals court said hawaiis restrictive definition of good 
cause conflicted with the federal welfare laws goal of 
fostering selfsufficiency and personal independence 
congress expressly included the good cause exemption to 
provide a shield for innocent late filers said the opinion by 
judge harry pregerson

the first of this seasons live from lincoln 
center telecasts was performed wednesday night by the new york 
philharmonic conducted by zubin mehta with guest pianist daniel 
barenboim 
some classical soloists who have taken up conducting as a 
serious parallel career find theyre better performers when they 
return to their musical instruments barenboim seems to be one of 
those playing with more conviction about the music than we 
remembered from some years ago 
barenboim who played two concerti was music director of the 
orchestre de paris from 1975 to 1989 and has been named music 
director of the chicago symphony beginning next season 
he hadnt played piano with the new york philharmonic since 
1984 
in his first piece beethovens concerto no 3 for piano and 
orchestra barenboims sound was that of a pianist who cares 
about the music he plays with clarity and he played on the same 
wave length as the orchestra merging the piano sound with the 
orchestras sound 
soft parts were very beautiful some of them were introspective 
some bittersweet some deeply sad but serene not anguished 
dignified not maudlin 
the concerto was played for its music not used as a showcase 
tchaikovskys concerto no 1 for piano and orchestra played 
after intermission was more of a showcase for speed and 
virtuosity when it began barenboim was more subtle and varied in 
dynamics than some recordings but mehta raised the volume and 
barenboim began to attack more aggressively 
this concerto is written to be a dazzler that the audience can 
flow along with one reason its so popular but its even more 
impressive when some of it softens more than was done wednesday 
night 
barenboim had the strength and passion for the furiously fast 
parts but his playing there seemed to flow less naturally than it 
had in the quieter parts of the beethoven 
the concert a pension fund benefit held in avery fisher hall 
began with webers oberon overture this is very sweet at the 
start and rises to some excitement through both moods the new 
york philharmonics playing was smooth as silk

a researcher says hes developed a simple test 
that could cost as little as 25 and provide early detection of 
many cancers but an american cancer society official said 
wednesday it may not be specific enough 
stuart gordon of the university of colorado health sciences 
center admits more research is needed but said results of early 
experiments published monday in the medical journal cancer 
research are promising 
this is too small a study to make any absolute statement but 
its enough to make us proceed with fullfledged clinical trials 
gordon said 
the test which uses just a few drops of blood detects a 
protein that appears to be present at high levels only when normal 
cells are becoming malignant he said 
the test was 100 percent effective in identifying the protein in 
the early stages of cancer growth and was 76 percent effective in 
identifying latestage cancers 
dr john laszlo a senior vice president for research at the 
atlantabased american cancer society said the test could be less 
useful than gordon thinks adding it was too early to tell 
its like taking your temperature you dont know from the 
reading whether you have tuberculosis or you have the flu he 
said 
the test is the result of research gordon began in 1972 when he 
set out to find out why cancer patients often have problems with 
blood clotting 
it struck me that this meant there was something coming from 
the cancer cells that activated this clotting he said 
gordon found a protein in the blood of most cancer patients 
particularly those in the early stages of their disease cancer 
cells apparently need the protein to reproduce but its purpose and 
origins have not been established 
i think theyve made a finding that this particular blood 
coagulant is abnormal and now we need to know how specific it is 
and how often people that dont have cancer do have this kind of 
abnormality laszlo said you might expect patients with other 
kinds of diseases to have this kind of protein in their blood 
gordons study involved 128 blood samples 54 from people with 
various types of cancers 20 from patients with benign growths and 
54 healthy subjects 
current tests are aimed at specific cancers but gordon said his 
test would detect any type of cancer gordon hopes expanded 
clinical trials will test at least 1000 people over a two year 
period 
gordon a biochemist and associate professor at the university 
of colorado school of medicine holds a patent on the blood test 
and is negotiating with several pharmaceutical companies to pay for 
the massive trials 
about 15 million americans are expected to be diagnosed with 
cancer this year with more than 500000 deaths projected figures 
show 
gordon said the test administered in a doctors office and 
costing 25 to 40 may be just four years away 
today we are able to do a better job of treating earlystage 
cancers with early detection significantly improving cancer 
survival tests he said

a new autopsy on the body of a 
reporter who died in a car crash last week cast doubt on reports

was a journalism professor at a local university and a contributor 
to the newspaper diario latino 
serrano said the investigation was continuing 
the armed forces press office said tuesday that four witnesses 
had reported seeing the reporters car had being struck by a truck 
the reporters were thrown from the vehicle after it overturned the 
press office said 
the journalists were returning from a reporting trip to eastern 
el salvador 
in mexico city the association of foreign correspondents in 
mexico sent a letter to salvadoran president alfredo cristiani 
expressing profound consternation at the deaths 
it urged the government to do all possible to clarify the 
circumstances of death and to bring to justice those ultimately 
responsible 
at least 40 reporters have died in political violence covering

in tonights new fox show brenda a pretty 
16yearold whose family just moved from minneapolis to the 
glittering hamlet of beverly hills is puzzled by what shes seen 
so far 
brandon she asks her twin brother are we going to make 
it here 
brandon has much wisdom the houses are bigger the weathers 
warmer but doesnt mean theyve cracked the meaning of life 
yknow what i mean 
this pretty well sums up the plot of beverly hills 90210 
a new onehour thursday series it originally was called class 
of beverly hills but fox either realized that todays beverly 
hills has no class or there are too many southern california high 
school series on tv 
with its decent wholesome twins played by jason priestly and 
shannen doherty the series concerns the assimilation of a decent 
wholesome midwest family into new and gosh almost unreal 
surroundings 
the two costars are pretty good actors but they deserve a 
medal or something because the premiere written by darren star 
yes darren star is so stultifying it would get an f even in film 
school 
and it runs 90 minutes 
you dont need that much time to prove that shows about vast 
wealth shallow people expensive cars monstrous mansions 
bubbling jacuzzis and even distorted values mean nothing without 
really bad dialogue 
there is almost no rbd as we call it in the trade to goof on 
here there only is stilted teen chat and stock teenage 
characters albeit the wealthy kind 
tonights show concerns doings in the makebelieve west beverly 
hills high school where the new kids in town first meet the 
pampered offspring of movie and tv stars tycoons and maybe network 
presidents 
the twins drive an old chevy compact not so their new peers 
they drive bmws mercedes and porsches and think nothing of sushi 
for lunch or friday night pool parties with rock bands with the 
whole school invited 
this display of the quiet good taste that is the hallmark of 
beverly hills causes a certain amount of teenage snobbery and 
insecurity of course 
but is it all that different from the midwestern kind maybe 
consider brandons new girlfriend a poor little rich kid the 
daughter of a rock band manager she casually says her mother once 
was a major groupie 
there is some excitement however in this clash of midwestern 
and movietown cultures 
for example brandon declines to make love to his new sweetie as 
they sit bubbling in her jacuzzi even though she enthusiastically 
suggests it 
he contends they havent known each other long enough i mean 
arent you supposed to hold out on me for a little bit 
this is soooo intense that she has a florist bring him roses a 
day later right there in spanish class 
alas the whole school gets the wrong idea about whats going 
on pattly because he doesnt deny anything not even when a 
classmate says you must be awesome dude brandon now faces a 
crisis 
but sister brenda isnt doing so well either she doctors the 
birthdate on her drivers license goes to a night club with new 
friends and meets a suave blonde 25yearold lawyer who thinks 
she is of legal age 
he is patient respectful and understanding when she says no 
on the first date but three dates later when hes pressing for 
bedtime she confesses her dark secret boy does he get cranky 
he carries on as if she is not sincere 
all this would seem prime fodder for a film about oldfashioned 
values in beverly hills you could call it teenage mutant ninja 
conservatives 
but all we get here is an epic in bland one in which the twins 
parents are only comforting ciphers and most of the wealthy 
teenagers are so tame it appears their idea of kicks is a driveby 
spending spree 
the nights only major crisis consists of brandons discovery 
that a bright ambitious coed he respects secretly lives in 
van nuys 
wow valley girl gnarly quel drag 
near tears she asks him this why should i be deprived of a 
good education because i am geographically undesirable 
my child thank your stars you are geographically undesirable 
if you continue at west beverly hills high you will wind up going 
into tv and writing a series with its own zip code like beverly 
hills 90210 
 
elsewhere in television 
grand minus two returns nbcs grand sitcom begins its 
second nbc season tonight its residents recovering from an 
endofseason tornado in the tiny pianofactory hamlet of grand 
two characters are gone now wayne the cop and tom the husband of

enrollment tripled at the orton 
school this fall but there is no risk of overcrowding three 
students now share the schools single classroom 
now i have someone to play with at recess said levi tibbs 
a fifthgrader who was the schools lone student last year 
his playmates are sisters emily hansen a second grader and 
sheri davis who is in sixth grade their attendance at the 1918 
schoolhouse has helped stave off its extinction 
we considered closing it but if we did then wed have to pay 
to board those kids in town or wed have to pay mileage for them to 
be driven to school and home every day said county school 
superintendent jerry kleinsasser 
and that trip is no quick jaunt the nearest town is fort 
pierre a long hours drive down 50 miles of bumpy winding road 
that follows the rugged breaks of the missouri river 
locals call the area starkly beautiful outsiders call it 
desolate winters are harsh and snowy on the dakota prairie and 
the wind almost never stills 
you can hear the coyotes fighting and jabbering all night 
long said teacher steve pickner 31 who lives with his dog in a 
rentfree mobile home on the school site his nearest neighbors are 
antelope grouse and rattlesnakes 
pickner is in his first year as a teacher he graduated from 
the university of south dakota in august and he has his qualms 
id rather teach 50 kids in one class than three in different 
grades he said thats 21 separate lessons i have to prepare 
each night but it does keep me busy and helps pass the time out 
here 
its hard to get used to the quiet after classes i look 
forward to tuesdays thursdays and saturdays when the mail comes 
pickner said 
occasionally he helps mend fences at a nearby ranch that raises 
one of the nations largest private buffalo herds 
elementary principal elsie baye says teachers rarely stay more 
than a year at orton its isolated she admits and the free 
housing is essential to lure teachers to such a rustic outpost 
still she persists in putting the best face on it someone 
who is an artist or wildlife photographer would just love it 
there 
and as for the children its a great educational opportunity 
our rural kids are usually good students they get a lot of 
oneonone 
levi tibbs mother loretta taught at the orton school her 
husband wayne and their three other children all went there 
they were almost a year ahead of other students when they got to 
ninth grade she said 
in ortons classroom big and bright with three desks in the 
middle two students sit together while pickner tutors the third 
across the room 
an outdated computer sits in one corner a television set that 
gets only one channel sits in another the other classroom fixtures 
include an aging piano an ant farm a water fountain and a 
microwave oven where the kids and teacher heat their lunches 
once a month a janitor shows up to shine the linoleum floor 
three times a day the huge bell atop the freshly painted white 
building tolls 
the bell did not toll this year for the orton school but its 
future is not assured stanley county rural schools once were full 
but fewer ranch families live in the area mrs tibbs said 
they couldnt all make a living here anymore because milking 
cows and a few acres of land just didnt cut it people sold out to 
others and the remaining ranches got bigger that cut down on 
families and kids in the area she said 
but orton is not alone in its tininess of the three other rural 
schools in stanley county none has more than eight students 
almost onefourth of the elementary schools in south dakota 
still have only one or two teachers legally schools cannot be 
closed unless enrollment slips to fewer than five and neither the 
kids nor their parents seem inclined abandon the small schools 
its funner than a big school said sheri davis

another budget another crisis another 
deadline deal complete with congressional vows that it wont 
happen this way again 
but it always does 
thats not the way the job is supposed to be done and there 
still is no guarantee that the bargain reached at the brink of 
budget disaster is going to hold 
president bush urged taxpayers who soon will be voters to back 
the plan calling it the best agreement that can be legislated 
now and saying the alternative is economic chaos with some 
republicans balky and with public opinion surveys reporting 
opposition to the tax and spending steps involved bush made his 
appeal tuesday night in a 10minute nationally televised speech 
after four months of futility and 10 days of hard bargaining 
budget negotiators reached a compromise before the dawn of mondays 
deadline and described the outcome as successful if politically 
distasteful 
but the deal carries its own fineprint concessions of failure 
it masks the true size of the projected federal deficit by ruling 
that some major expenditures simply dont count and erases 
ceilings that cant be met 
nevertheless the fiveyear 500 billion plan does make a start 
at pruning chronic deficits without it the government would be 
dispatched to chaos by automatic spending cuts under the 1983 
deficit control law that was supposed to avoid all this in the 
first place 
lobbying house republicans to support the settlement bush 
argued that all the alternatives are worse he said he had to 
compromise and they should too but he doesnt have to run for 
reelection until 1992 and theyre facing the voters in just over 
a month 
this is the sixth time in nine years that congress and the 
administration have negotiated budget deals because they cant 
handle the job the oldfashioned way in which presidents make 
proposals and the house and senate vote on spending and taxes 
because presidents have veto power that process required 
compromise and negotiations but the votes came first 
still congress seldom met its own deadlines for action on 
budget measures ignoring them because there were no sanctions to 
enforce them 
congress selfimposed budget deadlines have usually been 
missed and massive continuing resolutions and reconciliation bills 
have been the rule rather than the exception president reagan 
said in his final budget message 
he said those large cumbersome bills provide cozy hiding 
places for specialinterest spending by lumping all the 
governments money decisions into one giant measure reagan had 
said he wouldnt sign any more of them 
bush had said he wouldnt do business that way either 
government by continuing resolution or government by crisis 
will not do bush said in his first presidential address to 
congress in 1989 
the tax and spending provisions that make up the budget 
compromise of 1990 will go into giant reconciliation bill to be 
passed before oct 20 or else without it the automatic spending 
cuts will hit 
but first to buy time for that effort congress has to pass a 
budget resolution by midnight tomorrow the deadline on a fiveday 
extension approved on sunday the government also must have an 
increase in the debt ceiling which was extended through friday 
without deadlines nothing tends to happen 
sen jesse helms rnc likened it to the college student who 
never studied until the night before finals then crammed all 
night he flunked helms said and the result will be the 
same congress will flunk 
it has so far in every previous budget pact projected deficits 
have been far lower than the real ones turned out to be they 
have never once been met said sen daniel patrick moynihan 
dny they are wildly below reality 
the budget pact bush and congress negotiated last year forecast 
a deficit of 994 billion just under the legal limit the 
administration now forecasts a deficit of at least 2185 billion 
for the budget year that ended sunday 
the deficit ceiling was supposed to be 64 billion this year 
but that fiction is gone under the new budget agreement the 
projected deficit wont be that low until 1995 the target for this 
budget year has been more than tripled to a 205 billion deficit 
and getting there took a numbers game 
even so if the deal and the estimates hold the deficits would 
start to decline this is real bush said as he lobbied fellow 
republicans to make it happen

its a jungle out there for insurance buyers 
and unwary consumers sometimes spend too much for too little 
coverage because they dont know the right questions to ask 
consumer activist ralph nader believes the insurance industry 
would like to keep it that way 
there is a deliberate gobbledygook that occurs in order to 
reduce your commonsense defenses he said in a recent interview 
nader also believes a consumer backlash over high rates and 
confusing policies is erupting nationwide most notably in 
california where voters approved a proposition last year that 
mandates sharp cuts in auto insurance rates 
he says his latest book winning the insurance game should 
help dispel some of the confusion and better arm those shopping for 
insurance 
the book takes an encyclopedic approach to all the forms of 
insurance a typical american might encounter including government 
programs such as social security and medicare it explains in plain 
english the various types of insurance policies their benefits and 
their bad points 
nader said he wrote the book along with writer and former 
attorney wesley smith because he believes most consumers are 
illprepared in the insurance marketplace 
where would they learn they dont learn in school about how 
to buy and what not to buy in the insurance market are there 
consumer training clinics adult education no so they sort of 
pick up what they pick up through the school of hard knocks and 
thats not enough 
nader described a number of common mistakes of insurance buyers 
chief among them is not knowing about discounts that are available 
for the asking 
another mistake is assuming that all insurance companies and 
insurance agents charge about the same 
smith who also participated in the interview told of his own 
experience in buying auto insurance that shows the value of 
shopping around 
smith said he went to a number of companies that were the least 
expensive by reputation the best rate he found was about 2900 a 
year for two cars 
so i went to another agent who sold from the same carrier who 
had been in business longer i said look ive been offered this 
insurance but i know this price isnt right because i know based on 
the reputation of the company that you can do better he looked at 
me and he said let me ask you do you own your own home i said 
yes i do why because that puts you in a preferred rate that 
saved me 900 bucks a year 
nader said other discounts consumers need to ask about include 
those for airbagequipped cars and multiple policies in the same 
family in addition he said many people buy too much auto 
liability coverage based on the level of their assets that they 
need to protect 
another problem for many drivers he said is they dont know 
to put their best foot forward and get a reduction in price by 
showing theyve got a great driving record 
with life insurance a common error is being talked into an 
investment vehicle attached to the policy that really isnt needed 
but jacks up the rate nader said 
nader and smith said health insurance may be the most 
problematic for consumers 
they tend to buy too many micro policies that should be 
instead handled by an umbrella policy nader said why should 
you buy a cancer policy why should you buy any one of the micro 
policies that usually are overpriced 
another mistake he said involves socalled medigap insurance 
which supplements medicare 
some elderly people have been known to have five or 10 medigap 
policies they keep responding to that celebrity on tv who you saw 
in a movie 25 years ago 
among other mistakes with health insurance is ignorance of what 
policies exclude such as eyeglasses preexisting conditions and 
normal pregnancies smith and nader said 
but perhaps the biggest problem with individual health insurance 
is its cost the two said 
individual policies are basically out of the price range of 
most americans smith said so that leaves them with group 
policies through work and a lot of people will stay in jobs they 
loath rather than lose that potential benefit 
smith and nader argue that the only solution to the health 
insurance problem is a national health insurance plan

the budget agreement reached by negotiators and 
endorsed by president bush would depress the economy seriously 
slow job growth and in some ways be selfdefeating according to 
one study making the rounds 
former us treasury economists who conducted the study said the 
500 billion estimate of deficit reduction is badly overstated 
because negotiators chose to ignore the negative even recessionary 
economic impact of higher taxes 
the study for the national center for policy analysis and the 
us chamber of commerce concludes that in some ways the agreement 
would contradict its purpose costing 124 in lowered output for 
every revenue dollar generated 
most people are complaining about the new taxes they will have 
to pay but the greater burden is the loss of output and lower 
personal income that will be caused by higher taxes said gary 
robbins one of the authors 
robbins former chief of the treasurys econometric forecasting 
staff said the budget negotiators failed to recognize that 
implementation of the budget would produce a dynamic largely 
negative effect 
robbins and his wife aldona former senior economist in the 
treasurys office of economic policy now operate fiscal 
associates a consulting firm their econometric model produced 
these differences from projections in the budget agreement 
there would be 408000 fewer jobs by 1995 and almost 520000 
fewer jobs by the year 2000 
real gross national product the total of goods and services 
produced would be 1126 billion lower over the next five years 
and would be more than 50 billion a year lower than the 
projections by the end of the decade 
because tax payments would be lower in a depressed economy 
the federal government would receive only 67 cents of each dollar 
of new taxes it presumes to collect over the next five years 
the deficit reduction would be about 44 billion less than the 
fiveyear 500 billion estimate 
the study did agree with the office of management and budget 
projections used by budget negotiators that federal spending 
would fall as a percentage of gross national product but it 
differed in more ways than it agreed 
government forecasters assume that the federal government can 
collect new taxes without causing any economic harm said gary 
robbins our own forecast is more realistic 
he said the budget package would worsen an existing recession by 
imposing new income payroll and excise taxes in an effort to raise 
134 billion of revenues over the next five years 
by his estimates that effort would fail with new revenues 
amounting to only 902 billion again because higher taxes would 
depress economic activity over five years he said lost output 
would equal 450 a person 
the chamber and the center which commissioned the study have 
been both supporters and critics of administration policies in the 
past the center describes itself as a nonpartisian nonprofit 
policy research organization 
earlier analysts at the conservative heritage foundation whose 
ideas and policies have influenced thinking in the reagan and bush 
administrations called the budget agreement deplorable 
the heritage analysis by daniel mitchell a foundation fellow 
said the package combines the largest firstyear tax increase in 
americas history dubious economic assumptions phony spending 
cuts and inadequate enforcement 
mitchell said that at a time when annual economic growth has 
slowed to a crawl enacting of the agreement surely would throw 
the nation into recession

teaching moral standards and religious elements of history 
generally shunned by public schools in recent decades seems to be 
making a sporadic but growing comeback 
this is the assessment of specialists in the field who cite 
accumulating evidence of the shift which they say is urgently 
needed to overcome a huge gap in educating the young 
the situation has been pathetic educator charles r kniker 
said of the failure of recent decades to teach religions pervasive 
historical and social influences 
the omission has been documented in numerous studies of 
textbooks but the ignored influences and effects of religion 
gradually and sporadically are being restored kniker said 
its slow going but its a clear phenomenon he said in an 
interview theres a major growth of interest in academic study 
about religion in the schools its been a wilderness but 
certainly changes are going on 
kniker professor of education at iowa state university and 
editor of the journal religion amp public education has made a 
national survey of state policies on teaching about religion and 
moral values 
results showed a spotty pattern but indicated developing 
concern in that field 
since the survey broke new ground however prior data was 
lacking with which to compare the results 
the main purpose was to get a big snapshot of where we are now 
in this country a base line study to see what is the reality 
so comparisons can be made with it in the future he said 
thirteen states permit teaching about religion in social 
studies while typically prohibiting indoctrincation in a 
religions beliefs as alabama specifies it allows religious 
facts only 
ten states have school policies on the bible as literature some 
noting that the supreme court outlawed systematic or devotional 
reading of the bible but approved objective teaching of 
religion 
iowa for instance specifies religious books such astthe 
bible the torah and the koran shall not be excluded from any 
public school nor shall any child be required to read such 
religious books contrary to the wishes of the childs parent or 
guardian 
twelve states set policies on religion in world history some 
calling for units about religion in such courses 
california legislation requiring textbooks to have greater 
acknowledgement of the role of religion in history exemplifies a 
trend gaining much national attention the survey report says 
fortyone states have laws or guidelines on citizenship or 
character education and 20 states mention moralspiritual values 
but some indicated that teaching them was taboo or limited to 
democratic values 
kentucky leaves choice about values to school districts while 
ohio and wisconsin designate the values to be taught 
ohio lists compassion courtesy tolerance honesty 
selfdiscipline selfrespect responsibility courage diligence 
and integrity wisconsin adds personal ethics and the value 
of frugality 
twenty states allow observance of a moment of silence none 
mentioning that the practice replaced school prayer recitation in 
schools of the pledge of allegiance is required in 19 states while 
many make participation voluntary 
charles c haynes of washington dc president of the national 
council on religion and public education which publishes the 
journal edited by kniker said 
changes are coming very rapidly encouraging more teaching 
about religion in history and teaching of values many districts 
are adopting new policies the change is quite dramatic its 
now irreversible 
haynes author of a new book religion in american history 
what to teach and how published by the association for 
supervision and curriculum development noted recent approval by 
the california state textbook commission of a new history textbook 
published by houghton mifflin that covers religious dimensions of 
history 
haynes said both educators and religious scholars are achieving 
common ground about the essential inclusion of teaching about 
religion noting recent guidelines about it issued by broad 
religiouseducational coalitions 
the consensus grew out of a controversial time he said but 
now its generally recognized that teaching about religion is 
good for education good for students and more important good 
for religious liberty 
kniker said expulsion of religious knowledge from schools 
stemmed from misinterpretations of the 196263 supreme court 
decisions banning sponsored prayer and bible devotionals 
schools and textbook publishers purged virtually any religious 
reference fearing controversy even though the court had said 
study about religion was essential to education he said 
kniker said present changes in attitudes resulted from rising 
evangelical concern and from many studies showing the stark absence 
of religious facts from classroom versions of history and society 
school board and teacher requests for guidance materials have 
soared prompting the national council on religion and public 
educations distribution center at iowa state university in ames to 
open a telephone service kniker said 
more than 500000 copies of the pamphlet religion in the 
public school curriculum questions and answers which was put 
together by a wide array of educational and religious 
organizations have gone to school officials and others

toyota has taken the edge off its land cruiser for 1991 both 
inside and out the companys most expensive fourwheeldrive 
vehicle retains the wide brutish look of an offroad cruiser 
though design changes have softened its profile and smoothed its 
ride 
the squarish front hood is rounded and more aerodynamic theres 
fulltime fourwheeldrive to reduce vibration and tire wear and 
help with lowspeed steering for even more traction the center 
differential can be locked via a dashboard button and the vehicle 
shifted into low range 
coil springs at all four wheels give a smoother more carlike 
ride and the redesign includes 5 inches added to the wheelbase and 
2 to the track giving the land cruiser a longer wheelbase and 
wider track than either the range rover or jeeps grand wagoneer 
toyota kept the 4liter sixcylinder powerplant from last year 
the fuelinjected engine is rated at 155 horsepower and was paired 
with the standard fourspeed automatic overdrive transmission in 
the vehicle offered for testing 
the package offers enough power for lumbering over ditches and 
other rough terrain at low speeds but slow acceleration made it 
less satisfactory in highway passing toyota has not joined range 
rover and grand wagoneer in offering an eightcylinder engine 
as with most of the vehicles in this class fuel economy is poor 
at more than 4500 pounds the land cruiser weighs about as much as 
two ford escorts and gets 12 miles per gallon in the city and 14 on 
the highway the toyota got around 11 during a rigorous test outing 
that sampled a variety of driving conditions towing capacity is 
3500 pounds increasing to 5000 pounds with the optional towing 
package 
inside are firm flat cloth seats including a bench seat in 
the back that splits 5050 and folds down for extra cargo space it 
offered good legroom even with the front bucket seats all the way 
back three goodsized adults can fit in the back close but 
comfortable 
another three can fit in the optional third seat though its a 
bit lower to the floor and tighter this bench seat also splits 
5050 for cargo handling and folds up against the side walls a 
good place to keep it when not in use so the headrests dont block 
the rearwindow view the spare tire was stowed outside the 
vehicle beneath the cargo floor 
fit and finish was good on the test vehicle a newcomer also 
notices the extra visibility one gets from riding so high and with 
that the usefulness of the handles above each door when climbing 
in and out 
base price is 21998 the grand wagoneer is about 28000 and 
the range rover is over 38000 
consumer reports magazine did not have a listing of owner 
complaints on the land cruiser

blackandwhite usually it means plain 
explicit uncomplicated 
but in his law office where the white pages of statute books 
were blackened by a firebomb morris dees somehow keeps seeing 
shades of gray 
dees the founder of the southern poverty law center and its 
chief counsel in trials that have destroyed ku klux klan 
organizations wants to understand his bitter adversaries even 
the ones whove tried to kill him 
a lot of these people have paranoid personalities bred from 
basically family problems when they were children he says 
theyre looking for love and affection 
if you look at a klan roster just about everybody can be 
an exalted something it makes them feel important 
white supremacists chafe at such cool analysis and at least 
three racist groups have put dees at or near the top of their hit 
lists a display case in his offices holds charred law books and a 
melted clock reminders of the 1983 firebombing by klansmen 
in a case set for trial monday in portland ore the 
53yearold white alabama lawyer is suing an organization called 
the white aryan resistance for allegedly inciting skinheads to 
fatally beat an african man there 
a lawsuit he brought in 1984 in the lynching of a black 
teenager in mobile ala resulted in a judgment that bankrupted 
the united klans of america the victims mother buelah mae 
donald received title to the klans national headquarters 
dees pursued the case with zeal and yet he wept along with 
others when one of the killers stood up at the end of the trial 
and begged mrs donalds forgiveness 
i just think once you come facetoface with this person you 
stalk and their families thats a catharsis that a lot of 
people go through he said 
morris dees grew up blondhaired and blueeyed in alabama 
cotton country 
when asked the source of the righteous anger that seems to 
underlie the law center he tells a story of his youth 
he was 16 and his father sent him to accompany a tractor driver 
on the farm a black man named clarence to a court appearance 
clarence had been charged with drunken driving but dees believed 
his story his car had a tie rod come loose and hed hit a 
concrete median and knocked himself dizzy 
the justice of the peace operated out of a store and during the 
trial dees said he never quit serving crackers and cheese 
and cokes across the counter 
guilty was the inevitable ruling 
the fine was over 100 clarence didnt have that kind of 
money dees said i dont know that kind of set me on wanting 
to become a lawyer 
dees graduated from the university of alabama and its law 
school while still a student he set up a lucrative birthday cake 
delivery service and later sold books by direct mail he and a 
partner sold the business for a reported 6 million 
dees next put his directmail skills to work raising millions 
for george mcgoverns democratic presidential campaign in 1972 
then used the mailing lists to appeal for help on his own project 
the fledgling southern poverty law center 
the center grew out of his determination that there was an 
enormous gap in legal defense in certain kinds of cases said 
julian bond a black civil rights leader from georgia who became 
the centers first board chairman 
what drives morris dees a very welldeveloped sense of 
outrage said bond now a professor and broadcaster in 
washington dc 
he knows the legal system can be used to right wrongs 
the law center which now has an endowment of 30 million and a 
4 million annual budget has taken on death penalty voting 
rights employment discrimination and other cases but is best 
known for hauling the klan and similar groups into court 
klanwatch a handful of investigators at the montgomery law 
center backed up by informants around the country produces a 
bimonthly intelligence report on hate group activities which 
is sent to 4000 police agencies 
white robes reflected by a fiery cross the fear reflected on 
black faces in the night in the intelligence report these 
stark events are reduced to column upon column of statistics names 
and dates blackandwhite becomes gray again 
it appears to be good solid information said lt robert 
mcculley of the memphis tenn police information is hard to 
come by you dont go into a bookstore and walk to the section 
labeled terrorism 
to enter the southern poverty law center a visitor climbs steps 
walled with stone past a granite monument to civil rights martyrs 
the front door is unlocked electronically and inside a 
receptionist sits at a video security system 
its a necessary bunker bond said if you do this work 
from the safety of new york city its one thing but if youre 
right in the heart of the beast a sensible person takes 
precautions 
and dees does he varies his route and schedule to and from 
work he avoids alleys 
demon dees louis beam a texas neonazi once shouted 
during questioning by his nemesis in one case beam challenged dees 
to a duel 
exorcising the demon with a simple gunshot apparently was not 
enough for members of the order which murdered denver talk show 
host alan berg 
the preliminary plan called for kidnapping dees interrogating 
him then flaying him peeling his skin off his body before 
killing him wrote kevin flynn and gary gerhardt in their book 
the silent brotherhood 
in an otherwise eventoned interview the only strong profanity 
came when the softspoken dees was asked if he doesnt expect one 
day to become another name on the law centers memorial 
man i dont want to be a martyr to anybodys expletive 
cause he said i didnt get into this thing for a cause 
the law center began with a variety of suits challenging 
unhealthy working conditions in textile plants representing death 
row inmates and others 
dees first went up against the white supremacists in 1979 
agreeing to represent a black marcher attacked during a peaceful 
demonstration in decatur ala clubbed by kkk counterdemonstrators 
the man tried to defend himself with a registered gun dees said 
an allwhite jury convicted him 
dees thought back to clarence and his day in court nothing 
had really changed 
but it was about to he filed a civil lawsuit against the 
klansmen 
evidence uncovered by klanwatch led to federal indictments 
against 10 klansmen and the suit ended in a settlement that among 
other things required the whites to attend a race relations class 
the class was taught earlier this year by the rev joseph lowery of 
the southern christian leadership conference who is black 
one of the klansmen dees said the day of the 
demonstration he had a club in his hand eleven years later 
hes standing there holding hands with dr lowery in a prayer 
and saying maybe i was misguided back then and we could 
have solved our problems in a different way

a white supremacist accused in a lawsuit of inciting skinheads 
to commit a racially motivated killing in portland ore says he 
was merely exercising his first amendment rights 
the suit which seeks damages from the group white aryan 
resistance or war and four individuals is merely a roundabout 
way of cutting off freedom of speech freedom of association and 
even freedom of assembly said tom metzger the organizations 
leader and a defendant 
the oregon office of the american civil liberties union plans to 
monitor the trial set to begin monday in portland 
plaintiffs lawyer morris dees calls metzgers claims 
baloney 
the civil case follows the criminal conviction of three 
skinheads in the 1988 beating death of mulugeta seraw a 
27yearold ethiopian who was living and working in portland 
seraws skull was fractured with a baseball bat 
dees montgomery alabased southern poverty law center sued on 
behalf of seraws estate in the past the center has won millions 
in judgments by suing hate groups and their leaders arguing that 
they are responsible for damage and injuries done at their behest 
just as a corporation can be held liable for employees actions 
the suit contends metzger and his son john have recruited 
skinheads to war in recent years and that through agents they sent 
to portland they provided a skinhead group called east side white 
pride with racist materials promoting violence against blacks and 
jews seraws killers were members of east side white pride 
further the suit which was joined by the antidefamation 
league of bnai brith claims war agents were in contact with the 
metzgers in fallbrook calif met with the skinheads and 
encouraged them to harm blacks 
the allegations of personal involvement are totally 
nonsense metzger said its something that mr dees has 
dreamed up 
dees said he has letters and phone records linking the metzgers 
and their agents in portland as well as a damning 
affidavit in it one of the agents michael barrett tells of 
taking five baseball bats to portland of keeping close contact 
with the metzgers and of meeting with east side white pride 
skinheads 
we told them to use violence if they got an opportunity and 
to be sure and beat the hell out of the enemy barrett said in 
the affidavit we were telling them what tom and john metzger 
told us to say

often in the game but never on a winning team unable to emerge 
from a 30year shadow cast by his successful brother dick van 
dyke 
the fame he did achieve was dubious as the star of one of the 
most ridiculed failures in the history of television my mother 
the car 
if i waited for something good to come along id never 
work van dyke said when people talk about bad television my 
mother the car is the show that pops to mind there have been 
worse shows but thats the one people remember 
it was in 1965 while the the dick van dyke show remained 
one of tvs biggest hits that jerry van dyke got his first series 
with ann sothern as the voice of the mothercar 
id just turned down gilligans island because i thought it 
was ridiculous he recalled 
he went on to three other series failures accidental 
family the headmaster and 13 queens boulevard 
meanwhile his older brother won six emmys and tv immortality 
i have an act i take on the road jerry van dyke said 
thats what saved me i dont know how most actors make a 
living 
van dyke said the part of the handyman in the nowdefunct comedy 
series newhart was written for him but cbs nixed the deal 
but his persistence finally is paying off he was nominated this 
year for an emmy as best supporting actor in a comedy series for 
his role as luther van dam the befuddled assistant to craig t 
nelson in coach although he didnt win the nomination was a 
boost 
the emmy nomination did a world of good for my confidence 
he said ive always known i was good but if other people dont 
think so it can hurt your confidence 
it was a matter of not only being not successful but being in 
my brothers shadow he had one of the best shows on television 
and i had to compete with that it hurt my career i made my tv 
debut on his show and it did me a whole lot of good it got me in 
the public eye and cbs signed me but when i failed to produce it 
hurt me then i stayed dick van dykes brother i always knew if i 
had some success that id no longer be thought of as dick van 
dykes brother 
it was thought for a while that dick van dyke would make an 
appearance in a twopart coach episode as brother luther 
hasnt seen for 30 years but the role may be changed to that of a 
former best friend 
the part of luther was created for van dyke by writerproducer 
barry kemp who also created newhart van dyke had discovered 
kemp in phoenix and supported and encouraged him until he became a 
writer for taxi 
he met kemp during what he calls a really bad period of my 
life and career 10 or 12 years ago 
i was divorced he said i didnt have anything my career 
was shot i was working in joints this kid came to me and said he 
was a writer 
he liked kemps material so much that he put him up at his home 
in los angeles and paid him a salary 
although luther in coach was written for him van dyke still 
had to bring the character to life 
when you start on a show where do you find a character he 
said you dont know where hes going to go hes the worlds 
most negative man but that doesnt make a character in some ways 
hes comparable to me were the same age his life is very similar 
to mine luther says i never got married because i was afraid of 
getting divorced i never became head coach because i was afraid of 
losing 
he has no relationships he lives with a bird he doesnt want 
to make any waves he likes the status quo he has a cloud over his 
head yet in his own little world hes happygolucky 
van dykes career began during four years as an entertainer in 
the air force he won the all air force talent show twice 
which led to two appearances on the ed sullivan show 
his live act has earned him headliner status in las vegas reno 
lake tahoe and atlantic city and he also has appeared in a number 
of movies and the humorous miniseries fresno 
when hes not working he and his family live on a 500acre farm 
in arkansas

help is a phone call away for the thousands of 
women men and children who become instant military dependents in 
the persian gulf crisis 
more than 700 callers a month get advice at the family support 
operations center at fort totten queens home of the nations 
largest army reserve command 
the 77th army reserve command serves 14000 soldiers and their 
families 334 of them have been activated but the center will try 
to help callers from anywhere even from other military branches 
its tollfree number good in new york connecticut and new 
jersey is a lifesaver a lot of these people cant afford a 
longdistance phone call said paul m silverman a civilian who 
is family support coordinator 
sgt mary lou bohrnmann a reserve spokeswoman said most of the 
callers need quick advice or commiseration about 5 percent are 
overwhelmed a few call four or five times a day to hear a 
reassuring friendly voice 
theyre worried about keeping a roof over their head or money 
to pay for food said sgt 1st class patricia payne 
they get kind of panicky said master sgt george frangos 
most callers find out about the center from commanding officers 
or other military families an information packet also is mailed 
automatically when a soldier is activated 
payne frangos and silverman aided by six to 10 volunteers 
plus on weekends seven or eight nonactive reservists guide 
neophytes through the military bureaucracy 
theyll explain benefits theyll help when a departing soldier 
forgets to sign a check or a powerofattorney form 
theyll sic lawyers on an unyielding bank that refuses to lower 
a reservists mortgage rate or a landlord who threatens to evict a 
suddenly strapped family 
theyll send a financial planner to help the spouse who until 
now never wrote the checks they can even obtain a oneday 
emergency food supply although no one has asked for it so far 
and when the stress builds up the staff tells soldiers and 
their families theyre not alone 
one soldier was going off he was 21 or 22 i felt so sorry 
for the young man he was scared to death said payne 
he confided that he planned to spend his last night of freedom 
with his buddies payne concerned about his panic urged him to 
spend the night with his mother 
i usually dont take the problems home but i saw my son in 
him said payne i called him at 10 oclock that night his mom 
answered he said i stayed home because i had a feeling you would 
be checking up on me 
payne a widow with five grandchildren and three children 
relates to her callers before she was activated she worked at a 
bank to support herself and her youngest son whos a senior in 
college now theyre struggling to make ends meet 
we had scraped up every penny to put him through college he 
called me and said ma should i come back home but she 
wouldnt hear of it 
i can help everybodys problems here said payne but when 
i go home i cant help mine 
this has made us all more aware of our responsibilities 
too she said there are certain things we have to get in 
order

a decade ago moscow was a city of boasts of 
surefire government plans of blithe assertions that the soviet 
union would lead the world to a better society 
today it is a city of cynicism sometimes of despair talk is 
of just getting through the winter of keeping bare necessities on 
store shelves of somehow reforming a strangled economy before it 
collapses into chaos 
recent meetings with top soviet officials and a wide range of 
workers farmers and professionals suggest a darkening national 
mood that takes little account of the countrys enduring assets 
from gilded kremlin reception rooms to angry street 
demonstrations there is little mention of the nations rich 
natural resources its literate and educated workers its high 
technology and huge internal market all could be important engines 
of perestroika president mikhail s gorbachevs plan to revive the 
economy 
instead soviets point with growing alarm to shortages of food 
and almost everything else and the absence of any serious sign 
that things will improve soon 
life is hard as winter approaches despite the theoretical 
promise of perestroika prosperity seems far away 
 
the display cases are almost bare in the small poorly lighted 
food store on tverskaya street one of moscows busiest avenues 
today the store is rationing bread one kilogram 22 pounds per 
customer 
an elderly man profiting from the new freedom of speech 
accosts a group of american visitors its the communist party 
thats responsible for all of this look at the empty shelves 
muscovites say milk is still plentiful in state stores but that 
finding anything else is a roll of the dice the severe bread 
shortages of a few weeks ago are over but decent meat and many 
vegetables are rare 
in the cavernous gum department store on red square many stalls 
once crowded with goods are closed off by metal grates the goods 
may have been shoddy five years ago but at least they were there 
such shortages are common throughout the country 
actually we spend a lot less time waiting in line these 
days said a woman in leningrad russias secondlargest city 
now theres nothing to buy so we just stay home 
 
nikolai petrakov one of gorbachevs top political advisers 
puts it pointblank the economy to all intents and purposes 
has ceased to exist 
the declaration seems somewhat melodramatic outside the window 
is not an arid plain but a cacophony of trucks and buses hurrying 
workers and shoppers compete for space on the rainy sidewalks 
petrakov thinks he knows what the future looks like the 
government will make a start on economic revival with its 
muchdebated 500day plan petrakov says and predicts the 
transition to a westernstyle market economy will be complete in 10 
years 
others dwell more on the problems alexander yakovlev a senior 
gorbachev aide admits readily that reforming the soviet system is 
far harder than he imagined 
he says its fine to plan things like a modern real estate 
market and effective banks but how to do it in a country where no 
one knows what land prices should be and only two to three 
people really understand the western banking and credit system 
many people ask how authorities will persuade frightened 
conservative bureaucrats to give innovators the chance to make 
money in new ways and resuscitate the economy in the process 
 
at the ray of lenin collective farm outside moscow the chairman 
granted that soviet agriculture is less productive than us farms 
he sees the solution in importing american experts and studying 
us methods 
he opposes abolishing the whole concept of collective farms the 
soviet system in which families join in tilling land they do not 
own and receive wages in proportion to their work 
later in his neat cottage one of the farmers expressed very 
different ideas people will work really hard only if they own 
their land he said 
he said he tried to talk the farm chairman in the spirit of 
perestroika into one little innovation leasing him one of the 
collective farms greenhouses 
if he could make it more productive the farmer said he would 
earn extra money for his family and the farm could learn somethinge techniques 
the chairman 
about greenhoussaid no 
 
gorbachevs policy of glasnost has brought breathtaking changes 
to politics 
streetcorner orators denounce one politician or another as 
policemen stroll by unconcerned gorbachev and his ministers must 
defend themselves before angry legislators who want to know 
everything from what personal privileges the leaders enjoy to how 
they will reform the economy 
this looks at first like robust democracy but some soviets see 
the whole affair especially the raucous parliament debates 
televised nationwide as something else another 
cookedupinthekremlin plan to create the illusion of progress 
while the hopes of consumers are put on hold again 
people have learned to watch carefully y 
takeover to many observers including some western diplomats the 
most likely outcome is far less sensational a slow painful road 
to a market economy pocked with problems but as inevitable as the 
laws of supply and demand 
everyone agrees time is of the essence with every delay rumors 
spread resolve weakens and fear of anarchy mounts anarchists have 
a long history in russia and fear of chaos and the collapse of 
authority are widespread 
 
in a light rain as sunset nears 60000 people march just 
outside red square they hold banners demanding the dismissal of 
gorbachevs prime minister nikolai ryzhkov for economic 
incompetence 
a woman whose sign reads down with soviet power says reform 
must be speedy 
something must be done she cries ryzhkov cant cope in 
the united states if the government ever faced anything like this 
it would have to commit suicide 
behind her another group marches in ominous silence under the 
black flag of anarchists

the audience is down the competition from cable 
is rising despite the heady success of the civil war series 
pbs has its problems but it also has a plan to deal with them 
public television has appointed its first programming mogul 
responsible for picking the shows scheduling them and promoting 
them 
take a meeting big bird 
jennifer lawson the chief program executive will be able to 
give faster answers to program proposals speeding up what has been 
a cumbersome decisionmaking process a pbs board member says 
producers of cultural and entertainment shows who would have 
gone to pbs in past years now have cable networks as a market for 
their wares particularly the arts amp entertainment and discovery 
networks 
there are now so many more people looking for good programs 
that were not the only opportunity that people have as we used to 
be says the board member henry p becton jr president of 
wgbhtv in boston 
we need to be able to be more responsive to give quicker and 
more definitive answers to take more risks in order to have access 
to the best people and ideas 
he said its likely the board meeting next month will approve 
the final step in the plan that shifts 1055 million from various 
sources to a single program and promotion fund administered by 
lawson pbs executive vice president for national programming and 
promotion 
that will complete the process by which she has become the pbs 
equivalent of moguls like nbcs brandon tartikoff in charge of 
program selection scheduling and promotion 
in olden days public tv stations chose and helped pay for about 
half of the national primetime schedule through a voting process 
run by pbs station program cooperative come november that 
process will be history 
although lawson will pick programs she will consult a committee 
that includes pbs and public tv station executives and in some 
cases minority and independent producers she says 
it will not be me making decisions in a vacuum she says 
lawson who has spoken of experimenting with educational game 
shows and bringing more childrens programs to public tv says the 
full impact of the change probably wont be felt until the 199293 
season 
thats because many program projects now on the boards have been 
funded for this season and the next although next seasons 
schedule will give an idea of whats to come she says 
but the new system will allow better focus and planning she 
says it helps us move faster and it helps us move with more 
intelligence before with the program cooperative marketplace 
the process itself made the decisions 
it was a voting on a series of programs without putting them 
in any context and looking at what that does to shape our profile 
the new system helps us react faster to changes in the media 
environment 
its no secret whatsover that pbs ratings have fallen off 
she says even though 24city ratings for the civil war 
national ratings are due this week averaged a 91 the highest in 
pbs history the networks overall ratings dropped 3 percent in 
just the past year 
when trying to lure viewers back it sometimes pays to 
advertise lawson wearing her program executives hat did that 
last month 
pbs followed its civil war telecasts with a oneweek 2 
million showcase week advertising campaign on the commercial 
networks and cable tv touting pbs fall schedule of programs 
the sept 30oct 6 campaign plugging such series as 
masterpiece theatre the american experience and live 
from lincoln center wasnt a first for pbs lawson said 
some years ago the ford foundation did provide some funds for 
some limited advertising she said 
but the new campaign was pbs first in at least a decade she 
said and was ordered up because we really want to do as much as 
we can with our resources to highlight what were doing and make 
it as visible as possible 
pbs does a lot of showpromotion on its own 338 stations she 
notes but we feel were preaching to the converted we want to 
go beyond that and bring new people in 
another sign of changing times at pbs it may take a leaf from 
abc and nbc and become coowner of a cable service 
its studying the idea of starting a separate educational cable 
service with the discovery channel which serves 521 million 
homes 
but the main event at pbs now is its shift to a program 
czar and that hasnt occurred without sounds of alarm from 
public tv executives who worry that too much power is going into 
one persons hands 
one of the chief worriers william f baker is president of 
wnettv in new york his station has been a major producer of 
national shows among them the macneillehrer newshour 
nature and great performances 
he wouldnt want a return to the old programpicking system 
not at all the old system was cumbersome and were happy to 
do away with it 
but hes concerned he says that with the new system you have 
the risk of having a kind of common central taste and that the 
system may not take into account the complexities of getting 
funding for programs 
baker a pbs board member says what he worries most about is 
that big producing stations such as wnet have millions of dollars 
committed in advance to create these programs and if pbs doesnt 
help support those things weve already committed to they could 
literally destroy the major producing entities 
you just dont make these big shows commit to them today and 
make them tomorrow and thats one of our biggest concerns it can 
be very destructive unless that is realized 
there are some indications that they pbs officials 
understand that and will realize it but thats one of our biggest 
worries and that frankly is my primary worry 
wgbhs becton whose station produces nearly a third of pbs 
primetime series among them masterpiece theater and nova 
admits to having early reservations about the centralization of 
programpicking power at pbs 
unlike baker though his concerns arent couched in terms of 
potential doom far from it 
he said hes been working to make sure we had some safeguards 
some checks and balances in this new system im now pretty 
satisfied theyre in place and its a good plan im quite 
enthusiastic about it 
pbs needs that centralized power now he adds we need to be 
able to make quicker decisions for program producers and 
stations we need to be able to fund things that are a little more 
adventurous if you will 
the old system was good at approving programs that pleased a 
lot of people a little bit but not so good at finding a program 
that might have been more unique had more of an individual vision 
or whatever 
and i think we need more of that at this point

oil prices are showing an ability to fall as 
sharply on the hint of peace as they can rise on the hint of war 
crude oil futures plummeted more than 3 per barrel on the 
volatile new york mercantile exchange on tuesday a day after 
falling more than 2 a barrel 
the backtoback dives left traders wondering where the bottom 
would be just as they had wondered last week how high oil could 
rise as it moved into the 40 range 
the socalled war premium is being eaten away said 
annlouise hittle a senior oil analyst with shearson lehman 
brothers inc 
contracts for november delivery of light sweet crude oil closed 
314 lower at 3395 on tuesday crude contracts for later months 
all dropped most by 150 per barrel their maximum limit for the 
day 
oils fall this week started off in response to more moderate 
overtures from president bush and iraqi president saddam hussein 
once crude began sliding it dragged down futures prices for home 
heating oil and unleaded gasoline 
heating oil fell 8 cents to 9203 cents per gallon tuesday for 
november delivery all later contract months dropped by the days 
limit of 4 cents a gallon 
unleaded gasoline fell 698 cents to 8693 cents per gallon for 
november delivery all later contract months fell by their limit of 
4 cents a gallon 
natural gas fell 29 cents to 188 per 1000 cubic feet for 
november contracts most other contract months were lower 
as the tough talk by the gulf protagonists has faded the 
worlds oil supply picture has improved increased crude output 
from saudi arabia has begun to reach european markets easing the 
early strain from the iraq and kuwait oil embargo 
there was a window there where we had the shortfall from iraq 
and kuwait and we werent really seeing the increase in opec 
production hittle said that window happened to coincide with 
the fieriest rhetoric 
after the futures market closed tuesday the american petroleum 
institute released a report showing that the nations crude 
stockpile fell sharply last week gasoline stocks were up slightly 
while stocks of distillates which include heating oil were down 
slightly api said in its statistics for the week that ended sept

healthconscious consumers are on a lowfat 
buying craze and major dairy companies are having a cow about how 
to shed tons of fatty leftovers squeezed out of milk ice cream and 
other products 
as we take more fat out of our products which consumers are 
wanting more and more you have to have a place to put it which 
we dont said william d fischer president and chief operating 
officer of dean foods the nations secondlargest dairy 
were losing half a million dollars a month by selling the 
fat for less than it costs to remove it from the milk he said 
tuesday 
dean foods based in suburban franklin park produces about 44 
billion pounds of fat annually and is selling it at a loss while 
looking for some other way to use it 
the largest us dairy borden inc of new york faces similar 
problems although it keeps no detailed records of the amount of 
money lost this way said jim mckinley manager of financial 
communications 
its a problem that affects the entire dairy industry 
mckinley said sales of lowfat products have been increasing at 
a higher rate than other products 
skim and lowfat milk sales accounted for about 40 percent of 
the market 10 years ago but now comprise about 60 percent 
industry analysts said 
it reflects a changing consumer preference for lowfat 
products said john mcmillan foodindustry analyst with 
prudentialbache securities inc in new york fifteen years ago 
nobody bought lowfat and skim milk 
the turnaround occurred so quickly officials said that dairy 
makers were taken by surprise and had no alternatives for getting 
rid of the fat except to continue selling most of it for use in the 
production of butter butter however is also shunned by health 
and costconscious consumers 
theres now more butter on the market than we can possibly 
consume fischer said theres also a glut worldwide 
the industry has asked the federal government to ease its 
predicament with legislation aimed at providing incentives for 
farmers to breed cows producing lowfat milk with more protein 
farmers currently have no incentive to change breeding patterns 
because under federal pricing guidelines they receive the same 
amount of money no matter what fat content milk has 
the new way would reward farmers for producing milk with more 
protein and less fat fischer said 
the agriculture department supports such legislation because its 
budget is taking a beating after buying surplus butter in a 
multibilliondollar dairy pricesupport program 
the government this year reported 3975 million pounds of 
stockpiled butter purchased at a cost of 5026 million under the 
support program in which it annually buys about 10 percent of 
national dairy production 
those costs and the price of storing the dairy products are so 
high the government began giving them away to needy families in the 
early 1980s but the government began having problems giving it 
away because the stockpile was so huge said kelly shipp a usda 
spokesman 
giveaways to schools and other agencies now help reduce the 
stockpile each year but butter still is being produced at such a 
rate that the government suffers huge losses ms shipp said 
changes in the governments milkmarketing rules are years away 
however she said 
unfortunately the rules say we have to have a nationwide 
hearing process and farmer referendum before we make changes ms 
shipp said were moving as fast as we possibly can we cant 
just go out and change things tomorrow because we want to 
dairy companies grumble that even after any possible changes are 
drafted it would take years before farmers could breed cows to 
produce lowfat milk 
this is a problem weve had for years and each year that goes 
by without a solution costs us money mckinley said

michael milkens lawyers could get their first 
crack at their clients main accuser excon inside trader ivan 
boesky at a hearing on allegations the government says show 
milken deserves years in prison 
after four years of investigation and innuendo the governments 
most celebrated wall street fraud case finally will get a public 
airing starting next week at the special hearing ordered by us 
district judge kimba wood 
the government requested the hearing to try to substantiate 
charges made in a presentencing memorandum urging a stiff prison 
sentence against milken based on an alleged history of wrongdoing 
far beyond six felonies he has admitted 
assistant us attorney john carroll said tuesday the government 
would limit its inquiry at the hearing to four transactions by 
milken alleging insider trading and other wrongdoing in the 
mid1980s involving caesars world inc mgmua entertainment co 
storer communications inc and wickes cos 
the caesars transaction involves new charges of insider 
trading the three others were included in the governments 
original 98count fraud and racketeering indictment against milken 
handed up in march 1989 
wood last week had asked the government to limit its 
presentation to under five transactions of more than 35 included in 
its presentencing memo including allegations of insider trading 
stock parking and illegal payoffs to clients and money managers 
milkens lawyers in a lengthy rebuttal deny most of the claims 
the governments sentencing memo issued last week portrayed 
milken as a systematic lawbreaker who rigged the financial markets 
for his own benefit 
the defense said the 44yearold milken was a hardworking and 
honest businessman and philanthropist who has acknowledged his 
mistakes and shouldnt be punished for unproven crimes 
carroll said the government had not decided whether to call to 
the stand boesky the former arbitrager who implicated milken in 
wrongdoing shortly after he admitted in november 1986 to running a 
widespread insider trading network 
if boesky testifies it would be the first time defense lawyers 
will meet milkens chief accuser face to face other potential 
witnesses are former milken associates at drexels beverly hills 
calif highyield bond department boesky associates and others 
said to be involved in the alleged illegal transactions 
boesky was released in april after two years in federal custody 
of a threeyear sentence he has testified publicly once at the 
trial this summer of former stock speculator john a mulheren jr 
prosecutors presented a list of 14 witnesses who cooperated with 
government investigators typically in exchange for immunity from 
prosecution who may appear at the planned twoweek hearing set to 
begin next tuesday 
milken in april pleaded guilty to six felonies including 
conspiracy and tax and securities fraud and agreed to pay 600 
million in penalties in a deal settling broader charges but in its 
presentencing memo the government alleged many more crimes than 
those milken admitted 
milken faces a maximum 28 years in prison his lawyers have 
urged the judge to sentence him to community service developing and 
running innercity youth education programs in los angeles 
wood said the hearing is designed to shed light on milkens 
character to better enable her to devise an appropriate sentence 
both sides will have 20 hours to present arguments and 
crossexamine witnesses as at a trial 
the hearing further delays the longawaited sentencing 
originally set for monday in the most celebrated case stemming 
from the governments wall street insider trading investigations 
that began in late 1986 
milken attorneys are expected to use their presentation time at 
the hearing to present character witnesses who would bolster their 
request for community service in lieu of prison time 
arthur liman milkens lead lawyer said the hearing would give 
the judge the benefits of separating the myth of michael milken 
from the person 
the judge said that in sentencing she would discount any 
testimony about alleged lawbreaking by milken other than the four 
transactions she also said she may ask questions about some of the 
six felonies to which milken has pleaded guilty 
under federal case law sentencing judges can consider 
unadmitted conduct earlier this year another judge refused to 
consider such allegations against former stock speculator robert 
freeman

war is breaking out in the persian gulf but its 
over cigarettes not oil 
the antagonists in this battle are us tobacco companies giving 
free cigarettes to us forces stationed in the gulf vs 
antismoking groups who say the giveaways are a ploy to hook a new 
generation of soldiers 
philip morris usa the nations leading cigarette maker said 
tuesday it had donated 2 million smokes to operation desert shield 
in response to letters from tobaccodeprived soldiers 
larry glennie company director of military specialty sales 
said philip morris had shipped the 10000 cartons of marlboros to 
saudi arabia on sept 26 they were distributed free to members 
of the army air force and marines who have the least access to the 
basic comforts of everyday life he said 
the shipment followed a sept 25 announcement by the much 
smaller brown amp williamson tobacco corp that it planned to send an 
undisclosed number of free kool milds and richlands to the us 
contingent defending oilrich saudi arabia against a possible iraqi 
attack 
smoking critics said the moves subverted a 4yearold defense 
department health policy aimed at discouraging cigarette use 
as health organizations we certainly have to be concerned 
about the readiness of our troops said fran dumelle chairwoman 
of the coalition on smoking or health a washington lobby group 
i think the coalition is principally outraged at the tobacco 
industrys attempt to exploit the situation in the mideast she 
said in every war in the last 40 years the industry has used 
the concept of free cigarettes to hook a new generation of 
smokers 
steven dickinson a spokesman for the american cancer society 
said he wasnt surprised by the giveaways but questioned why the 
pentagon hadnt taken a public position on the free smokes 
the point is the department of defense has recognized that 
smoking is a deterrent to fitness here they are playing into the 
tobacco companies dickinson said 
at the pentagon defense department spokesman maj douglas hart 
said he would have to check further before he could comment on the 
tobacco company announcements 
this is the first ive heard about this to tell you the 
truth hart said 
it was unclear whether the free cigarettes violated the 
pentagons antismoking policy which was begun in 1986 by 
thendefense secretary caspar w weinberger 
the policy restricts where soldiers may smoke and subjects 
recruits to an aggressive educational campaign to discourage them 
from smoking because of what medical authorities have called the 
extreme health risks which include cancer 
glennie said philip morris had received a number of letters 
requesting cigarettes from troops in operation desert shield 
they were having trouble getting cigarettes glennie said 
he rejected the antismoking lobbys criticism 
i dont think theres anything we do that we dont get 
criticzed for he said the company felt that since wed 
gotten the letters directly from the frontline troops we thought 
it was the right thing to do 
a philip morris press statement quoted one unidentified letter 
from a paratrooper in the 82nd airborne division as saying we 
are not greedy people just paratroopers unable to get hold of 
great cigarettes so any cigarettes you could send us would make 
our stay here much more pleasurable 
another soldier was quoted as saying we came over here with 
hardly any notice and most of us are out of tobacco and tired 
philip morris usa is part of philip morris companies inc 
the worlds largest consumer products company based in new york 
besides its cigarette brands which include marlboro and benson amp 
hedges the company sells items ranging from miller beer to maxwell 
house coffee to velveeta cheese spread

occupational safety and health administration 
fines would increase for the first time in the agencys 20year 
history under the 500 billion deficitcutting package 
the proposed sharp increases in federal fines for workplace 
safety violations came under fire from business and labor leaders 
on tuesday 
the aflcio has been pushing higher osha fines for years but 
spokesman rex hardesty complained tuesday that the proposed 
increases were being spurred by a desire to cut the deficit rather 
than an effort to protect workers lives 
under the deficitreduction package unveiled sunday by white 
house and congressional budget negotiators osha fines would be 
raised by five times the most serious penalty for willful 
violations of workplace safety regulations would increase from 
10000 to 50000 
mark cowan who heads a consulting firm that represents 
corporations said it sounds like oshas about collecting money 
to pay the tax man its like the former georgia speed traps 
where they used a massive campaign to catch speeders to raise 
revenues for the state 
cowan who served as a labor department chief of staff and osha 
aide under thenpresident reagan said the agency would be 
regulating without public involvement contending the plan 
would not get a thorough hearing in congress 
aflcio spokesman rex hardesty said officials wont raise osha 
fines when our brothers and sisters lives are in jeopardy but 
theyll raise fines for a deficit 
labor secretary elizabeth dole had pushed for a threefold 
increase giving the agency the power to levy fines as high as 
30000 for the most flagrant violations noted department 
spokeswoman johanna schneider 
the department supports the fivefold increase in the budget deal 
because president bush supports it she said 
she said osha inspectors still would be most concerned with 
worker safety adding were just not interested in cash or the 
bottom line 
the higher fines would raise an estimated 95 million in the 
1991 fiscal year and 11 billion more over the next four years 
according to the office of management and budget

shoppers in this deliriously rich 
dallas enclave look at it this way if you can afford a 50000 
mercedes benz surely my dear you can afford the luxury tax on 
it 
i dont like it but i think its fair said rick jones 
sorting through designer shirts at the polo shop one of this 
communitys highpriced shops 
but randle stricklin a salesman at cartier inc where watches 
range in price from 1000 to 20000 complained the tax burden 
should fall evenly on all retailers 
it hits hard he said why single out luxury dealers who 
have suffered in the last 10 years especially in texas 
elsewhere in the country merchants who cater to the carriage 
trade complain that the government proposal to raise taxes on 
bigticket items including expensive cars yachts jewelry and 
furs discriminates against their wealthy clientele 
though they protest many merchants are bracing for a flurry of 
sales as customers rush to put an extra case of champagne or a pair 
of sapphire earrings on their tab for the holidays before the tax 
takes effect 
the 10 percent luxury tax part of a 500 billion 
deficitreduction agreement unveiled sunday would apply to the 
portion of the price of some luxury items over certain thresholds 
for example a 6000 fur priced 1000 above the 5000 tax 
threshold would cost 6100 if the taxes are approved by 
congress cars would be taxed at 10 percent of the amount above 
30000 the threshold for jewelry would be 5000 
if you can afford to pay 30000 for a car you sure can 
afford to pay a few hundred dollars more said terri jung of 
austin as she left a neimanmarcus store 
my first answer as a luxury car dealer is maybe it isnt 
fair said todd meier president of rodger meier cadillac where 
55000 cars are sold from a chandelierlit showroom but 
overall as a citizen i think it makes sense to tax people who 
theoretically can afford it 
meier said virtually all of the more than 2000 new cadillacs he 
sells each year would be affected by the tax 
highland park home of the billionaire hunt brothers and tycoon 
t boone pickens sits squarely in the middle of dallas a separate 
world where nannies wheel their charges along streets lined with 
mercedesbenzes cadillacs and bmws 
highland park shopper billy mccarthy said the luxury tax was 
unjust itll just be going for the wealthy he said were 
overtaxed as it is 
most agreed the taxes might slow the economy by dissuading 
middleclass shoppers but would not affect the rich 
it might prevent people like us were going to think twice 
said deann ralston windowshopping with coworkers outside 
bachendorfs jewelers 
in any case luxury is in the eye of the beholder 
roger rock manager of a tiffany amp co store said he didnt 
think the taxes would slow business tiffanys catalog lists 
jewelry ranging from under 200 to nearly 1 million 
it depends on what you call luxuries rock said from my 
point of view these are all necessities

the backlog of patent applications for 
inventions in the biotechnology field has grown to 8213 and some 
applicants are waiting almost four years for final action by the 
patent and trademark office a study says 
the general accounting office in a report released tuesday 
said the inventory of unexamined biotechnology patent applications 
increased by about 33 percent in 1989 and 1990 and that efforts to 
accelerate the process have been less effective than 
anticipated 
waiting time for biotechnology patents the study said averaged 
about 26 months last year compared to a 19month average wait in 
other technology fields 
rep ron wyden who ordered the study by the gao the 
investigative arm of congress called the finding very very 
disturbing 
these sorts of delays not only put struggling young biotech 
companies at risk they may also hold up distribution of new 
lifesaving drugs seed for supercrops or engineered organisms to 
clean up pollution the oregon democrat said 
to obtain a patent applicants must file descriptions of the new 
technology patent examiners then determine if the proposal is new 
useful and significantly different from earlier patents this 
requires experts who understand the science involved to search 
previous patent files 
among biotechnology patents issued in 1989 those for genetic 
engineering inventions took the longest an average of 474 
months patents for immunology inventions took an average of 441 
months and biochemicals 377 months 
the gao said the patent office increased its biotechnology 
patent examiners from 91 to 112 from october 1988 to july 1990 it 
said more examiners could not be hired because the patent office 
lacked experienced senior staff to train the new employees 
the report said the lack of experienced examiners in 
biotechnology has caused the first examination of patent 
applications to be delayed an average of 131 months compared with 
an average of 71 for all technologies 
patent office officials once set a goal of reducing the 
processing time for biotechnology applications to 18 months by 
1992 but the report said the officials now believe they will be 
unable to meet that goal

wealthy americans would bear the lightest 
share of the burden imposed by the new 500 billion 
deficitreduction plan while the poorest people would shoulder the 
greatest costs a congressional study says 
the richest onefifth of american families with annual 
aftertax income averaging 81934 would lose 09 percent of their 
earnings as a result of the plan that would come to a 766 loss 
but the poorest onefifth of americans would lose 2 percent of 
their average 7316 annual aftertax incomes or 148 according 
to the study by the house ways and means committee 
the average american family would suffer a 12 percent hit its 
33401 average aftertax income would shrink by 394 
the analysis seems to show that one of the priorities democrats 
touted during their four months of budget negotiations with the 
bush administration a package that spreads the burden based on 
peoples ability to pay was not achieved 
the study analyzed the effects of the higher taxes and benefit 
program cuts the package would impose these include levies on 
luxury items tobacco alcohol fuel airline tickets and the 
incomes of people who earn more than 100000 annually 
the package also applies the 145 percent medicare tax to people 
with incomes of up to 73000 rather than the current 51300 it 
increases the monthly 2860 premium medicare recipients pay for 
doctors care by about 5 and doubles the 75 deductible 
beneficiaries themselves pay for physicians bills 
it provides a number of tax breaks for businesses and expands 
the earned income tax credit for the poor 
it also requires states to impose twoweek waiting periods for 
people waiting to collect unemployment benefits 
the study also concluded that 
for families in the secondlowest fifth of annual income 
averaging 16917 the loss would be 16 percent or 272 
for families in the middle fifth averaging 25896 the loss 
would be 13 percent or 347 
for families in the secondhighest fifth or an average of 
36481 the loss would be 11 percent or 416 
the study also made a pitch for the 145 billion expansion of 
child care initiatives that the ways and means committee is 
pursuing 
the analysis showed that if the child care measure is approved 
along with the extension of the 3 percent tax on telephone calls 
intended to pay for it the distribution of the budget package 
would be spread more evenly 
the poorest onefifth of americans would lose 09 percent of 
their aftertax incomes while the wealthiest onefifth would lose 
1 percent

physicists at princeton university say they 
have developed a fusion reactor capable of producing as much energy 
as it consumes a step that brings them closer to harnessing the 
energy of the hbomb 
scientists said tuesday the breakthrough allows them to move 
ahead with developing fusion as an alternative to coal and nuclear 
power 
but they cautioned that the project which has spanned 15 years 
and cost 1 billion faces several major hurdles including 
determining how to extract the energy from the reactor and could 
be decades away from commercial use 
scientists said their tokamak fusion test reactor at princeton 
can reach the breakeven point 
its step one the first real threshold you have to get across 
to get an engineering device whose ultimate objective is to produce 
much more energy than you put in said robert sachs a physics 
professor at the university of chicago 
the researchers at the princeton plasma physics research 
laboratory have combined atoms of a heavy form of hydrogen called 
deuterium to form helium and energy 
the next step which researchers hope to achieve in 1993 would 
use a mixture of deuterium and a radioactive form of hydrogen 
called tritium to generate large amounts of energy in the tokamak 
reactor 
dennis manos principal research physicist at the princeton 
labs said that with modifications the reactor will be capable of 
generating 10 million watts of power a day 
manos said the joint european torus laboratory in england is 
working on a similar form of energy and is observing many of the 
same findings as their princeton counterparts 
the process used at princeton has nothing to do with the 
socalled cold fusion claimed by scientists at the university 
of utah last year manos said the utah scientists said they had 
produced energy from fusion at low temperature with simple 
apparatus possibly opening the way to an almost limitless supply 
of cheap energy but other scientists generally have rejected their 
claims 
fusion which powers the sun and the stars creates energy by 
combining or fusing two hydrogen atoms into a heavier helium 
atom by contrast fission which powers conventional nuclear 
plants releases energy by splitting atoms 
the hydrogen bomb uses fusion to cause mass destruction 
proponents say fusion eliminates the danger of reactor 
meltdowns produces less radioactive waste than current nuclear 
plants do and is produced from a readily available source 
hydrogen 
it is a potentially safer technology but it has a long way to 
go when you compare it with existing commercial fission 
technology manos said 
manos described the tokamak as a doughnutshaped fireplace lit 
by blowtorches deuterium is heated to the point where atoms break 
into plasma a mixture of free electrons and free nuclei 
scientists then bombard the plasma with a hightech blowtorch 
radio waves and highenergy particle beams 
tokamak has attained 50000 watts and a world record temperature 
of 400 million degrees centigrade with the deuterium mixture manos 
said 
the next step which is scheduled for 1993 is to see if a 
deuteriumtritium mixture will burn in tokamak manos compared it 
to developing a way to ignite a wet log in a fireplace 
after that the trick will be to set up a controlledfusion 
reaction that will keep going without prodding by the particle 
beam 
you take the blowtorch away from the wet log and see if the 
log still burns manos said adding such a step is at least a 
decade away 
the soviet union the united states japan and the european 
economic community hope to develop a test reactor sometime after 
the year 2000 he said 
manos and sachs cautioned that even if a test reactor is built 
researchers will still have to find a way to get at the power 
how to extract the energy from the reactor in a useful way is 
an engineering question no one has yet answered sachs said

international media mogul rupert 
murdoch said wednesday he will merge four of his australian 
newspapers into two aroundtheclock productions 
the head of news corp told a news conference that the morning 
melbourne sun and afternoon herald would become the heraldsun in 
sydney the afternoon mirror and the morning daily telegraph will 
operate as the daily telegraph mirror all but the herald are 
tabloids 
these farreaching changes are made as part of a commercial 
decision to consolidate news ltds competitive positions in both 
cities he said 
the moves come amidst a plunge in the value of news corps 
stock it was trading wednesday at the equivalent of 556 a share 
942 earlier this month 
the fall has wiped out more than 166 billion of the companys 
market capitalization and led the australian stock exchange to 
launch an inquiry news corp told the exchange tuesday it did not 
know the reason for the decline 
the new 24hour editions publishing monday through saturday 
are expected to start next monday while murdoch said there would 
be no cutbacks in editorial staff other production areas will be 
trimmed 
he said the sunday sun and the sunday herald in melbourne would 
continue as separate publications 
the new sydney paper is projected to have a circulation of 
480000 compared with 600000 for the herald sun 
murdoch said the move was one part of news corps goal to move 
to hightech color printing in australia which would see full 
color printing on every second page 
prime minister bob hawke said he felt the mergers would be 
beneficial overall it will probably mean a loss of jobs for some 
people but as far as the community in general is concerned they 
probably will get a better service he said 
hawke said he did not foresee damage from a reduction in the 
divergence of newspaper voices 
if i look at the sort of opinions that come out of the 
telegraph and the mirror and out of the sun and the herald and the 
two city papers down there i dont see an enormous divergence of 
opinion he said

few things get agriculture department 
officials as worked up as prospects of a demonstration in front of 
their administration building 
the building is where the secretary of agriculture has his 
office and its convenient for tourists walking along the mall as 
they take in the museums and art galleries 
its also a great place for ceremonies such as planting trees 
and for demonstrations against all sorts of injustices and 
grievances 
a bit of each was in store on tuesday a bright autumn day 
scheduled by the farm animal reform movement or farm to protest 
what the group sees as the inhumane treatment of cattle hogs 
sheep and poultry that farmers produce for consumer tables 
on monday the office of secretary clayton yeutter sent notices 
to reporters that he would be participating in a treeplanting 
ceremony on tuesday an hour before the scheduled demonstration by 
farm members 
yeutter the notices said would share the planting of three 
trees with his excellency major general juvenal habyarimana 
president of the republic of rwanda in central africa 
both the united states and rwanda recognize the importance of 
reforestation the notice said the usda is the lead agency 
in the national tree planting initiative with the goal of planting 
one billion trees a year 
the notice added that president habyarimanas reforestation 
programs serve as models for other african nations hoping to 
increase their agricultural production 
on tuesday morning during a staff meeting yeutters press 
secretary kelly shipp was informed that the treeplanting had 
been canceled 
a bit later another notice went to reporters saying that 
president habyarimana has canceled his stay in the united states 
and returned to rawanda 
habyarimana cut short his visit to deal with an invasion of his 
nation by up to 10000 rwandan refugees living in uganda the 
refugees returned to their homeland on sunday and attacked several 
villages prompting us embassy officials to begin moving 
americans out of the region today 
the troubles in rwanda aside agriculture department officials 
were left with no ceremony and the question of what to do with 
three unplanted dogwood trees 
the forest service provided a partial answer one tree already 
was planted so yeutter and guest could throw a few shovels full of 
dirt on it during the ceremony and picturetaking the other two 
standing nearby were to be taken to the national arboretum 
at 3 pm right on schedule a handful of farm protesters 
gathered across the street from the administration building near 
their exhibits which included gory photographs of slaughtered 
livestock and a wooden crate containing a dummy calf to portray 
veal production 
more demonstrators showed up with signs and banners condemning 
animal cruelty on the farm at the peak of the march about two 
dozen demonstrators traipsed back and forth for cameras and a few 
reporters 
nearby at least two dozen federal police officers and usda 
security people barred the way to the front doors of the 
administration building 
sandra behm one of the organizers said in an interview that it 
was annual world farm animals day as proclaimed by her group 
and also the birthdate of mohandas k gandhi the late indian 
leader 
behm said farm has about 13000 members nationwide and that she 
was surprised more of us didnt show up for the demonstration 
what does she want legislation that would improve the 
conditions of animals raised on factory farms where they are 
confined and kept in conditions of horrible suffering during 
their lifetimes 
does this mean pigs should wear boots and cows woolen bras to 
protect their udders 
no i dont think theyd like that she laughed i dont 
think thats natural 
but in the end behm said wed like the whole world to wake 
up and see that eating animals and animal products is killing us 
killing the environment 
meanwhile she said until that happens animals will be raised 
and killed for food but we should do it as humanely as 
possible 
a short while later five members of the protest group were 
taken into custody as they tried to outrun guards and enter the 
administration building two were released but three were taken 
away for booking as trespassers 
there were no visible serious injuries 
well take care of em said behm well get em out 
suddenly it was all over protesters melted away and usda 
officials got over their jitters

on oct 13 1989 wall street was suddenly faced 
with a problem a planned buyout of ual corp the big airline 
holding company collapsed for want of financing touching off a 
minicrash in stock prices 
today nearly a year later wall street still has a ualbuyout 
problem plus a long list of others that have since all but 
overshadowed it 
in the process the acute selloff that struck the stock market 
last fall has given way to a chronic case of malaise in just about 
every major category of investment including stocks bonds and 
real estate 
though the two ailments might look very different at first 
glance analysts have begun to diagnose them as symptoms of a 
single phenomenon the first fullblown bear market in nearly a 
decade 
weve moved from a time of euphoria to a period of financial 
distress said hugh johnson at the investment firm of first 
albany corp in albany ny last year around this time is when 
everything started to come unstuck 
as johnson and a good many other observers see it the big 
problem then and now can be summarized in the same simple terms 
deteriorating credit conditions 
as autumn 1989 arrived wouldbe lenders were fleeing the market 
for junk debt such as the bonds and other loans used to 
finance takeovers like the proposed ual buyout the flagship 
junkdebt firm on wall street drexel burnham lambert collapsed in 
february 1990 and deals like the one for ual still have not been 
concluded 
as autumn 1990 begins the supply of money to lend is 
contracting in many additional places most notably at the big 
multinational banks near the heart of the financial system 
it started at the highrisk end of lending johnson said 
now its much more broadbased 
any talk of a yearold bear market might not seem to square with 
recollections that the dow jones average of 30 industrial stocks 
reached a record closing high of 299975 less than three months 
ago on july 16 
but broader market indexes made up of hundreds of stocks rather 
than a handful of blue chips lagged behind in this years trading 
and most have never equalled the peaks they reached around 
september 1989 indeed the highs for a few stockprice yardsticks 
still date back to before the crash of 1987 
the charts of bank stocks tell the story in most vivid terms 
for instance citicorp parent of new yorks biggest bank sold for 
as much as 3550 a share last year lately it has been trading for 
less than 15 
the banking industry is the major worry said thom brown an 
analyst at rutherford brown amp catherwood inc in philadelphia 
for most people all this raises a bottomline question must 
trouble on wall street translate into equal travail on main street 
does each drop in the prices of stocks or junk bonds portend a 
recession of worsening proportions 
no single definitive answer to this question has yet emerged 
most of the experts now are talking of a mild economic downturn 
perhaps two consecutive calendar quarters in which the nations 
gross national product after adjustment for inflation declines 
just what toll that might exact in jobs reduced corporate 
profits or lost tax revenues for federal state and local 
governments remains to be seen 
some analysts talk of a risk that recession either already 
under way or soon to begin could prove a lot more severe than has 
been predicted 
others by contrast argue that most of the damage can be 
confined to a relatively few industries where money and credit 
conditions are most pivotal banking investments housing and 
perhaps a few more 
these observers argue that much of the country did not share in 
the speculative credit boom of the 1980s and thus might not feel 
the full weight of its collapse in the early 1990s 
for instance businesses that sell significant amounts of goods 
overseas could get a lift from the decline of the dollar in foreign 
exchange over the past year energyrelated businesses stand to 
benefit from the same surge in oil prices that has heightened fears 
of a recession since iraqs invasion of kuwait on aug 2 
in addition many analysts say the bleaker the economic outlook 
gets the more likely interest rates are to start falling sooner 
or later cushioning the impact of the slump and if all goes well 
helping to set the stage for a subsequent recovery 
but hardly anybody sees such a recovery as a prospect for the 
near future analysts at wright investors service in bridgeport 
conn concluded the question at issue it seems to us is no 
longer whether the us economy will sink into recession but how 
deep that recession will be

the association of european airlines 
said wednesday its 21 member carriers posted a 10 percent rise in 
overall passenger traffic in august but called the growth 
profitless 
the rise kept pace with traffic growth over the past year the 
aea said adding that the gulf crisis higher fuel prices and other 
cost increases have seriously eroded already thin profit 
margins 
current growth could fairly be described as profitless the 
aea said in a statement 
aea said fuel costs had been rising before the gulf crisis began 
and had not been offset by the relative weakness of the dollar 
while depreciation in the dollar has softened the effect 
of more expensive fuel it has also reduced the value of the 
european airlines dollar earnings during the peak transatlantic 
travel season the aea said 
in august aea traffic to and from the middle east was down but 
losses on gulf routes were largely offset by gains in traffic to 
and from israel

president bush today called on congressional 
skeptics to support a 500 billion package of tax increases and 
spending cuts he said lawmakers will be courting disaster if 
they do not pass it 
bush urged members of congress to vote for the package and then 
blame the president when they talk to voters 
earlier white house press secretary marlin fitzwater said we 
dont have enough votes yet to pass the budget package he said a 
senate vote will be close but the house at this time would defeat 
the plan worked out by administration and congressional 
negotiators 
bush called the budget agreement balanced and fair although he 
acknowledged it will hit americans in the wallet 
theres nothing that is without pain the president told a 
group of journalists from around the country 
however he said it is our last best chance to try to get 
this federal deficit under control 
there comes a time when you have to make tough decisions give 
a little and do what is best for the country bush said 
he said he too had to compromise to get the deficitreduction 
agreement no one got everything he or she wanted he said 
bush broke his no new taxes campaign pledge to get the 
budget agreement 
we linger along and dont get a deal we are courting 
disaster he said 
looking to the congressional debate on the package this week he 
said i call upon the congress both house and senate to cast 
their vote for this plan and to prove to the american people that 
we can solve problems that we can go out and get something done 
and put this nation on the path to longterm economic growth 
federal reserve chairman alan greenspan said today he supports 
the deficitreduction package giving bush a big boost in his 
efforts to sell the compromise proposal to congress 
greenspans views were seen as crucial because supporters of the 
package are looking to the federal reserve to lower interest rates 
to offset any negative economic effects from cutting government 
spending and raising taxes 
fitzwater and treasury secretary nicholas brady who briefed the 
visiting journalists said congress might make some changes in the 
package fashioned after months of wrangling by the negotiators 
there will be some details that will be fleshed out said 
fitzwater but he insisted they would not be significant changes 
if the major provisions do not remain he said you dont have 
an agreement 
brady discussed changes in the context of mistakes that might 
have been made in the crush to finish the deal im sure those 
mistakes will be corrected he said 
asked about the 12cent tax increase on gasoline included in the 
package bush said i cant get enthusiastic about a tax on the 
american people we are not dealing with the best of all worlds 
but he added we are trying to solve an enormous problem 
the tax is fair he said noting that gasoline tax in the 
united states is still substantially below world markets 
while the spending cuts and tax increases will hurt different 
people in different ways bush said the 500 billion package is 
the medicine that a sluggish economy needs to go forward to have 
more growth 
he acknowledged there is hesitancy on the part of both democrats 
and republicans who have to face the voters next month to accept a 
plan that increases taxes 
i have to understand the passions of people standing out there 
for election he said he indicated he would not try to punish 
republicans who dont support him i cant bring myself to be 
recriminatory he said 
he acknowledged that every once in a while the going gets a 
little tough nobody said it would be easy 
however he insisted that even with some members of his own 
party shunning the budget agreement i dont feel embattled 
bush in a television address to the nation tuesday night urged 
americans to convince skittish lawmakers that backing the package 
wont cost them reelection 
today he continued high pressure lobbying to bring house 
republicans on board he met with 20 republicans this morning and 
planned to contact as many later in the day 
bush also canceled political travel plans for thursday and 
friday which would have taken him to new england to campaign for 
several gop candidates he decided to stay in washington to lobby 
for a possible congressional vote on the budget package 
fitzwater said several lawmakers indicated today that bushs tv 
address gave them the justification they needed to back the 
package 
it fulfilled a part of their need which was to have an 
explanation from the president to the voters the spokesman said 
im not and i know youre not a fan of tax increases bush 
said in a nationally televised address tuesday night 
but if there have to be tax measures they should allow the 
economy to grow they should not turn us back to higher income tax 
rates and they should be fair he added referring to the 
proposed tax increases on gasoline cigarettes boats liquor and 
furs 
many lawmakers already are shunning the package because it will 
hit americans hard in the wallet a fact that could reverberate 
when voters go to the polls next month 
the 500 billion budget accord reached sunday after months of 
negotiation shaves benefits to farmers and medicare recipients and 
reduces tax deductions for people who earn more than 100000 
a congressional study released tuesday said the poor would be 
hit hardest by the package and the rich would feel its increases 
the least the plans increased taxes and reduced benefits would 
take an average 2 percent of the earnings of onefifth of americans 
with the lowest incomes according to the survey by the house ways 
and means committee 
speaking for the democratic leadership senate majority leader 
george mitchell echoed the president saying this package is a 
compromise neither side got what it wanted 
democrats he said in an equaltime tv address after bush spoke 
joined a republican president to get the agreement now he said 
we hope the republican members of congress will also set aside 
partisan differences in doing whats right 
while it is expected to take a tough sell among many democrats 
as well as bushs fellow republicans who dont want to endorse tax 
increases and spending cuts in an election year some opponents 
said the president had a good chance of getting the package through 
congress 
one rep newt gingrich rga said that more than half the 
house republicans were opposed or leaning against the package but 
that administration lobbying eventually would sell it 
support is considered stronger in the senate where only 
onethird of the 100 members are up for reelection this year while 
all 435 house seats are up for grabs

she speaks softly neutralizes adversarial 
lawyers with grace and charm and often wears a ribbon in her 
flowing dark hair 
the sweet gentility and stunning good looks of us district 
judge kimba m wood may belie the stiff discipline of her federal 
courtroom but acquaintances know better 
wood is strict shrewd and exacting 
she is about to make history as the judge to pronounce sentence 
on michael r milken the billionaire junkbond pioneer described 
by prosecutors as wall streets most devious crok 
shes a brilliant judge careful patient considerate 
concerned about reaching the right decision said jeffrey 
mishkin chairman of the new york city bar associations federal 
courts committee who has known wood for years 
but woods sentencing record largely for minor drug offenses 
reveals nothing about how she may punish milken whose case may set 
a standard for the future treatment of whitecollar criminals 
at 46 she is the youngest member of the 21judge manhattan 
federal court one of most active in the nation where celebrity 
defendants ranging from imelda marcos to john mitchell have stood 
trial she was appointed two years ago and received milkens case 
by random assignment 
the exdrexel burnham lambert inc executive faces up to 28 
years in prison for admitting to six felonies in a plea bargain 
last april most stemming from his relationship to inside trader 
and government informant ivan f boesky 
speculation over how wood will decide milkens fate has become a 
hot topic especially since she took the extraordinary step of 
delaying a scheduled oct 1 sentencing to allow for a hearing into 
other crimes milken may have committed 
she ordered the hearing which begins next tuesday after 
digesting mounds of documents from the prosecution and defense 
along with hundreds of letters painting widely divergent pictures 
of milken 
the prosecutions presentencing memorandum alleged a range of 
crimes well beyond those the financier admitted the defense called 
his crimes aberrations in an otherwise upstanding life 
wood opted for the hearing to get a better understanding of the 
real milken 
from all i can see about how shes handling the case shes 
doing it very well said harry first a new york university law 
professor familiar with woods background 
shes not going to give in wildly one way or the other on the 
pressure first said i doubt shell see him as this wonderful 
man whos been railroaded by the government nor someone who made 
so much money that he should go to jail for a long time 
still its conceivable she will spare milken from prison as 
his lawyers have urged and put the financial wizards talents to 
work in a community service program she cant give him any more 
than the maximum 28 years 
the few nationally significant cases wood has handled dont 
provide a full picture of her overall views but suggest shes 
willing to buck conventional thinking 
in october 1988 for example she reversed a ruling by the 
immigration and naturalization service that had denied refugee 
status to a ghanian soldier who helped plan an botched coup 
attempt wood said in some circumstances a coup may be the only 
means by which political change can be effected 
in another instance last year she upheld the right of a 
76yearold new york state judge to seek reappointment although he 
had passed retirement age 
she knew the answers to every argument that was made 
indicating she had done a great deal of preparation said the 
state judge isaac rubin shes capable of handling any matter no 
matter how difficult it is 
if theres been any flaw in woods handling of the milken case 
so far experts say it was her decision to accept his plea 
agreement in the first place its ambiguity played an important 
role in the delay of milkens sentence as lawyers haggled over the 
relevancy of unproven crimes 
it looks terrible for the defendant to plead guilty to so much 
less than what the government says he did said albert alschuler 
a university of chicago law professor who studies plea bargains 
this flap about whether the government can talk about these other 
crimes should have been settled at the time of the plea 
agreement 
wood declined through her clerk to be interviewed to avoid even 
the appearance of prejudice or conflict of interest in the milken 
case his defense attorneys and prosecutors also declined to 
discuss the judge for the same reason 
nonetheless public information and interviews with others 
including her husband reveal a portrait of a widely admired 
jurist working mother fluent french speaker registered democrat 
avid cook tennis buff and ballet aficionado 
shes always had this very calm exterior and yet shes very 
tough said husband michael kramer a time magazine journalist 
who first met wood in 1981 i mean in the judicial sense in a 
steeltrap mind way 
like other working parents she struggles to balance time for 
her 4yearold son and the rigors of the judgeship which often 
means she gets home at 9 pm and works weekends still friends 
say she has never been intimidated in what historically has been a 
maledominated profession 
i view her as a great role model for women lawyers because she 
has a style that asserts itself in a totally elegant way said 
laura handman a friend and lawyer at the new york firm of lankenau 
amp bickford shes completely in control but not at all in an 
aggressive obnoxious way 
kimba maureen wood was born jan 2 1944 in port townsend 
wash her parents found the name by leafing through an atlas and 
settling on kimba a small town on south australias eyre 
peninsula 
woods resume reads like a classic example of superlatives she 
attended the sorbonne in paris got her ba from connecticut 
college masters degree from the london school of economics and 
law degree from harvard university 
she specialized in antitrust law and spent more than 15 years at 
the new york law firm of leboeuf lamb leiby amp macrae where she 
represented clients ranging from lloyds of london to st regis 
paper co and eventually earned more than 200000 a year 
she was excellent to work with much appreciated by clients 
because she was quick to understand their problems said taylor 
briggs a senior partner who was on the committee that hired wood 
she was the right combination of a good person and good lawyer 
softspoken but firm 
her success prompted other judges to privately encourage her to 
seek a seat on the bench although it meant a 50 percent pay cut 
she was appointed by thenpresident reagan in april 1988 on the 
recommendation of republican sen alfonse m damato 
she presented us with a final decision on it briggs said 
that was typical of her she decides what she wants to do and 
does it 
although physical appearance has nothing to do with her work 
many say woods dark brown grayflecked hair jadegreen eyes and 
high cheekbones are an integral part of the impression she leaves 
shes a girl scout reverent brave honest loyal friendly 
helpful said lloyd constantine a friend former adversary and 
chief of antitrust enforcement for new york state 
constantine said he believed woods approach in the milken 
affair was typical of how she handled cases as a lawyer 
she probably wishes she could do this in isolation outside 
the microscope he said knowing thats impossible she is 
absolutely preparing herself to the teeth about this her hallmark 
was being overprepared coming into every discussion completely 
fully informed

it was a stunning disclosure from campeau corp 
a year ago the real estate developer who pulled off the biggest 
retail takeovers of the 1980s couldnt meet interest payments on 
billions of dollars in junk bonds used to finance the deals 
no one knew at the time but the heavy debt load from its 
purchases of allied stores corp and federated department stores 
inc would set off a chain reaction that rippled through corporate 
america 
the junk bond market collapsed on the news bringing the 80s 
takeover boom to a sudden halt as financing for deals vanished 
it didnt end there a month after campeaus announcement an 
attempt by united airlines employees to buy parent company ual 
corp unraveled when bankers fearful of another disaster refused 
to back the deal 
the failure of the ual buyout led in turn to a 190point drop in 
the dow jones industrial average on oct 13 the turbulence in the 
junk bond market ultimately contributed to the bankruptcy of drexel 
burnham lambert the investment firm that pioneered the risky 
highyield securities as a tool for financing buyouts 
the federated and allied deals were not the only debtfinanced 
transactions to falter so did the 49 billion leveraged buyout of 
southland corp and doskocil incs 133 million takeover of wilson 
foods corp 
but a year later corporate finance is not in chaos last years 
turmoil brought about a more conservative attitude toward buying 
and selling companies 
the emphasis now is on buyouts undertaken not for investment but 
for strategic reasons such as expanding a companys business and 
market share 
economists and analysts can look back over the past year and at 
the buyout binge itself and find that despite some pockets of 
trouble takeovers accomplished a lot of good 
it would be naive to say they didnt do damage said 
professor alfred rappaport a mergers and acquisitions specialist 
at northwestern universitys kellogg graduate school of management 
but when you look at it holistically there were 
considerably greater benefits than costs 
others agree youve still got a very small number of highly 
leveraged actions that hit rough waters said gregg 
jarrell a finance professor at the university of rochesters 
william e simon school of business its an exaggeration to look 
back and say my goodness what a terrible idea its inconsistent 
with the evidence 
during the takeover boom critics complained about assets being 
sold to finance buyouts but analysts say these divisions and 
subsidiaries often landed in good hands those of entrepreneurs or 
companies seeking strategic acquisitions 
something like 80 percent of the assets acquired in leveraged 
deals end up being sold to strategic buyers said jarrell 
takeovers also turned some firms around you needed some way 
to change management or change direction in a company thats not 
doing so well and in many cases we got that said bernard black 
a corporate finance professor at columbia universitys school of 
law 
black cited revlon inc as an example of a company that 
benefited from a buyout 
takeover strategist ronald perelman won control of revlon in 
1985 and pared down all its businesses except for cosmetics 
he sells off health care to people who run health care and 
probably run it better black said he keeps the cosmetics 
business and buys more building up the revlon name 
sometimes just the threat of a buyout kept managers on their 
toes 
after gaf corp dropped a takeover attempt of union carbide 
corp in 1986 carbide recapitalized sold businesses including 
eveready batteries and glad plastic bags and focused on chemicals 
it became a better company and its stock price rose black said 
without the takeover boom we wouldnt have made the progress 
in getting ahead into productivity in the way that weve begun to 
do said rappaport that was an important prod to management 
but does this mean that executives now facing less of a threat 
from outsiders will let their companies become flabby 
no because takeovers helped create a force that isnt going 
away institutional investors who are becoming increasingly active 
and forcing management to be more responsive to shareholders 
theyve had to step up to the plate now that boone pickens and 
carl icahn and those folks have been hobbled jarrell said 
the institutions many of them big public employee pension 
funds were already gaining notoriety in the early 80s but they 
are more aggressive than they would have been had it not been for 
the takeovers said jarrell 
institutions found that the large blocs of shareholder votes 
they controlled gave them power even beyond takeover battles and 
proxy fights where dissidents sought to unseat directors 
despite such achievements analysts dont ignore the reality 
that debtfinanced takeovers damaged or destroyed some companies 
and curtailed the profits and expansion ability of others 
the problem was money was so easy to borrow that no one worried 
about exorbitant prices and insurmountable debt 
people lost sight of how to value a company rappaport said 
the sin was not leverage the sin was paying too much and 
utilizing leverage in companies and times where it wasnt 
warranted 
black agreed saying the prices just got to points where 
everything had to go right for anyone to make any money 
that was the exact problem in the buyouts of federated and 
allied which cost campeau 10 billion 
today the two retailers are mired in the chapter 11 
reorganization process so is ames department stores inc which 
foundered after acquiring the zayre discount store chain 
other companies went out of business after buyouts most of the 
b altman and bonwit teller stores owned by l j hooker corp and 
the garfinckels and miller amp rhoads store chains 
southland is walking a tightrope trying to complete a planned 
bailout by a japanese retailer but also considering a chapter 11 
filing 
these companies have a common thread they are retailers but 
thats no coincidence many buyouts that stumbled were in cyclical 
industries subject to the uncertainties of consumer spending or 
seasonal factors 
but even a food company like doskocil was not immune from debt 
problems and it is also reorganizing in bankruptcy court 
theres one silver lining amid the misfortunes of overburdened 
companies new opportunities for other businessmen 
companies and funds have been formed to rescue firms ge capital 
corporate finance group for example has established a specialty 
operation providing debt and equity for restructurings 
reorganizations and turnarounds 
although the end of the takeover boom forced many wall street 
firms to trim their investment banking staffs todays strategic 
transactions prompted some dealmakers to leave the big firms and 
set up their own companies

the european community on wednesday asked for 
special exemptions from world trade rules while the eastern part of 
germany is integrated into the 12nation trading bloc 
a senior ec official told the council of the general agreement 
on tariffs and trade that the ec wants permission to make its own 
arrangements with trading partners of former east germany 
the official tran van thinh said although bilateral deals with 
east berlin violated gatts international rules the ec could not 
ignore the legitimate interests of eastern european countries 
gatts most favored nation principle stipulates that a 
government should not give trading benefits to one country without 
extending them to other members of the trade forum east germany 
was not a member of the 99nation gatt 
east germanys external trade was 59 billion in 1988 
twothirds was in bilateral deals with the soviet union and other 
countries in comecon the east european trading group 
a statement from the ec said an abrupt halt to this trade would 
lead to a number of additional factory closures further loss of 
production and higher unemployment in the countries affected 
the ec said transitional arrangements would be limited both in 
duration and scope countries affected would include the soviet 
union poland hungary czechoslovakia romania bulgaria and 
yugoslavia

sales of the big three automakers north 
americanmade cars and trucks dropped 89 percent in late september 
and 10 percent for the 1990 model year which ended with ominous 
tones from the mideast and capitol hill automakers said wednesday 
general motors corp ford motor co and chrysler corp said 
their vehicle sales fell to an average daily rate of 38648 during 
the sept 2130 period this year compared with a rate of 42408 
during the same time last year 
car sales fell 51 percent and truck sales were off 151 
percent 
each of the automakers said it still hasnt seen any dip in 
sales volumes or move to smaller more fuelefficient cars tied 
directly to rising oil prices in the wake of iraqs invasion of 
kuwait on aug 2 
but ford sales vice president robert rewey said the decline was 
spurred by sagging consumer confidence 
accordingly now that the deficit reduction agreement has been 
reached we hope that interest rates will be reduced rewey said 
referring to sundays proposal on new taxes and spending cuts to 
shrink the deficit 
among the new taxes is a threestep proposal to boost the 
federal gasoline tax to 21 cents a gallon after next july 1 from 
the current 9 cents a gallon congress still must enact legislation 
for such charges to be implemented 
such a tax increase coupled with rising gasoline prices because 
of the mideast crisis may push consumers into smaller cars 
analysts have speculated 
for the 1990 model year which ran from oct 1 1989 through 
sept 30 the big threes domestic car and truck sales dropped to 
an average daily rate of 31496 compared with 35002 the year 
before 
car sales fell 13 percent and truck sales dropped 54 percent 
in lateseptember last year automakers were winding up 
endofmodelyear fire sales that included attractive cash rebates 
and lowinterest financing deals 
when the 1990 model year began last october the companies 
pulled back on their incentives and their sales rates plummeted 
through the first nine months of the calendar year the big 
three said their vehicle sales were down 82 percent as car sales 
fell 106 percent and truck sales declined 42 percent 
ford said its lateseptember domestic car sales rose 35 percent 
but truck sales fell 3 percent for a combined 11 percent increase 
in vehicle sales so far this year fords combined car and truck 
sales were 86 percent behind last years pace 
fords modelyear sales of domestic cars and trucks were down 10 
percent from the 1989 model year 
gm said its car and truck sales for late september were 161 
percent behind last year with car sales down 122 percent and 
truck sales off a hefty 233 percent through the first nine months 
of this year gms vehicle sales were down 54 percent 
for the 1990 model year sales of gms domestically assembled 
vehicles were off 88 percent 
chrysler has been in a sales slump since february when 
incentives expired on the companys popular minivans it said its 
lateseptember truck sales which include minivans fell 143 
percent compared with the yearago period and car sales were up 55 
percent combining for a 47 percent decline in vehicle sales for 
the period

a year since campeau corp found itself buried 
in takeover debt the buyout business has regained much of its 
vigor but the junk bond market that fueled the 1980s merger boom 
still lies battered and bruised 
analysts say the bonds will make a comeback someday because they 
were too good an idea to give up 
its a legitimate financial tool and too many people made too 
much money for something like that to be forgotten said gregg 
jarrell a finance professor at the university of rochesters 
william e simon school of business 
alfred rappaport a professor at northwestern universitys 
kellogg graduate school of management agreed obviously theres 
some stigma attached to it but the broad idea of making capital 
available at less than investment grade to companies is as 
appealing now as in the 80s 
campeaus 66 billion buyout of federated department stores 
inc and its earlier 36 billion takeover of allied stores corp 
depended heavily on junk bonds the companys announcement that it 
could not meet interest payments on the highyield securities 
shocked the 200 billion junk bond market sending prices sharply 
lower 
but that was just the first in a series of hits the next one 
came in october after a planned employee buyout of ual corp 
faltered bond prices were slammed again in january as federated 
and allied filed for bankruptcy protection 
january brought another cruel blow lowerthanexpected ratings 
for bonds issued by rjr nabisco inc the companys outstanding junk 
bonds once a rock of stability amid the markets turmoil fell 
10 percent in value in one day and took other junk issues down 
with them 
this past summer brought a recovery of sorts to the market 
prompted in part by rjr nabiscos plans to recapitalize and retire 
some junk debt the financial press began to talk about a comeback 
but in august iraq invaded kuwait triggering concerns about a 
weakening economy the junk market fell to new lows as it suffered 
along with other bonds stocks and the dollar 
investors lost billions of dollars as the junk bond market 
collapsed some of them were savings and loans associations that 
became insolvent and were forced to seek government assistance 
perhaps the biggest casualty of the junk bond troubles was 
drexel burnham lambert the investment firm that pioneered their 
use as a buyout tool drexel was forced to seek chapter 11 
bankruptcy court protection because of its own junk bond losses 
with a track record like that its hard to imagine junk bonds 
could make a comeback 
but they were popular investments not only because they helped 
some people make a lot of money they also helped companies that 
couldnt get credit any other way and they helped young companies 
like mci communications corp expand 
it is central to the growth of key industries and companies 
said rappaport of the junk market 
furthermore people in the financial markets have very short 
memories he said 
but just when the market will come back is hard to say 
especially with the economys current malaise and with debt 
increasingly becoming a fourletter word 
at a time when the economy is slowing youre better off 
slowing an accumulation of corporate debt said alan levinson 
director of financial services with wefa group an economic 
forecasting service in bala cynwyd pa 
furthermore companies feel its safer to secure bank loans at 
several points above the current 10 percent prime rate than to sell 
bonds carrying interest rates of 16 percent or 17 percent 
even when the market does revitalize no one expects junk debt 
to be issued at the pace of the 1980s

the dollar declined on world currency markets 
wednesday amid expectations that interest rates are poised to move 
lower 
gold prices bounced higher in a technical rally on new yorks 
commodity exchange bullion settled at 39390 up 480 a troy 
ounce later republic national bank quoted a late bid for gold of 
39400 an ounce up 5 
the dollar slumped following federal reserve chairman alan 
greenspans endorsement of the proposed budget agreement he told 
congress that the 500 billion deficitreduction package would 
lessen pressures in credit markets though he did not 
specifically promise to lower interest rates greenspan said he 
most certainly believed an enacted budget agreement would exert 
downward pressure on rates 
lower interest rates make dollardenominated securities less 
attractive thereby reducing investors need for the us currency 
greenspans comments drove the dollar down to new lows 
for the week said marc chandler an analyst at the consulting 
firm idea still chandler noted that the dollar did not pierce 
the bottom of a broad trading range 
trading was relatively light which exacerbated the dollars 
move downward 
chandler predicted traders will continue to sell dollars ahead 
of fridays release of unemployment data for september 
earlier in tokyo the dollar eased to 13665 japanese yen from 
tuesdays 13673 yen later in london the dollar fell to 13515 
yen in new york the dollar closed at 13604 down from 13672 yen

in london one british pound cost 18990 more expensive for 
buyers than tuesdays late 18890 in new york it cost 19025 to 
buy one pound more expensive for buyers than 18930 on tuesday 
other late dollar rates in new york compared with late 
tuesdays rates included 15420 german marks down from 15495

become the new president 
colts which makes the militarys m16 rifle did not

autorino said stilwell would be a candidate for that job as well 
in march gamble autorino and colt firearms executives joined 
with striking workers and the state to buy the gun maker from its 
parent colt industries the buyout which drew some criticism 
because it brought the state into the gun making business ended a 
bitter threeyear strike at the company 
last week a state financial report indicated the market value 
of the states 25 million investment of pension funds in colts 
decreased by about 13 percent in the cmmpanys first three months

american express is trying to recoup over 
24000 in charges from an unemployed woman who declared personal 
bankruptcy shortly after a twomonth european tour with multiple 
cards 
you gave this woman seven cards thats appalling chief 
us bankruptcy judge alexander paskay told ira axelrod an 
american express representative during a hearing tuesday 
last october dixie lee dorsey went on an eightcountry european 
tour and charged 24227 on two of her seven american express cards 
although she had little income and has been without a job since 
1978 
you were just charging whatever you felt like charging 
larry foyle an attorney for american express asked ms dorsey 
i was having a good time ms dorsey replied 
the 37yearold winter haven woman declared personal bankruptcy 
in january shortly after she and her two daughters returned from 
the trip 
american express travel related services is trying to recover 
the money she charged the company maintained she obtained the 
green and gold cards under pretexts and charged luxury goods and 
services even though she knew she couldnt pay for them 
dorseys number of accounts was unusual axelrod said but not 
unique he said card holders can charge as long as their payment 
history is good and ms dorsey was current on all seven accounts 
until she went to europe 
on her bankruptcy petition she listed total debts of 193577 
paskay didnt rule immediately but said he would issue an order 
on whether she should be held responsible for the american express 
charges even though she is in bankruptcy proceedings 
ms dorsey who appeared without a lawyer said she once had as 
many as 25 credit cards 
even though she quit her last job 12 years ago she said she was 
able to meet her obligations until her boyfriend disappeared late 
last year with much of her property she said he had been giving 
her between 3200 and 6000 a month

politicians from the northeast are fighting a 
proposed 2cent per gallon tax on home heating oil as ranking 
officials disagree on whether the proposal could scuttle the budget 
agreement 
the regional dispute drew a call to texas sen lloyd bentsen 
from his 1988 presidential running mate massachusetts gov michael 
s dukakis the governor said wednesday 
bentsen who ran for vice president alongside dukakis said that 
if taxes are raised on other petroleum products heating oil should 
be no exception 
his goal was to ensure an equitable sharing of the tax 
burden spokesman jack devore said 
bentsen argues that the gasoline tax is more burdensome to 
residents of southwestern states who drive farther on average 
than northeasterners 
but northeasterners are particularly concerned about heating oil 
because a cold snap last december caused prices to skyrocket and 
the middle east crisis is pushing prices up going into this years 
heating season 
sen edward m kennedy dmass said he is among those working 
to eliminate the heating oil tax from a budget agreement hammered 
out by congressional leaders and administration officials 
on the house floor rep silvio conte rmass warned wednesday 
that the heating oil tax could lead to a mass defection by 
northeastern lawmakers from a budget agreement the budget 
compromise had originally exempted heating oil from any new tax 
but it was changed at the last minute 
mr speaker i hope you and the majority leader in the other 
body senate help me restore the home heating oil exemption 
conte said because without it support for the budget package 
among the northeast and this member is shaky 
contes threatened defection is notable because as ranking 
republican on the house appropriations committee he was among the 
participants in the closeddoor negotiations that led to the budget 
agreement between the bush administration and congressional 
leaders 
rep barbara kennelly dconn joined in the antiheating oil 
tax effort by writing to bentsen i cannot accept the twocent 
tax on heating oil this is a longtime traditional disagreement 
between our regions but i refuse to concede 
treasury secretary nicholas brady in a washington news 
conference acknowledged that the heating oil tax is politically 
sensitive but rejected the suggestion that the issue alone could 
sink an agreement on reducing the federal deficit by 40 billion 
the heating oil tax raised concern and anger among northeastern 
officials as much for how it happened as for the substance of the 
proposal 
according to conte the summit agreement made final on sunday 
contained a specific exemption protecting home heating oil from a 
general 2centpergallon tax on other petroleum products but 
later even as congressional leaders were gathering at the white 
house for a news conference on the agreement bentsen had a white 
house staffer use whiteout to erase the heating oil exemption 
dukakis told a news conference in boston that bentsen told him 
the heating oil exemption was put in the agreement without his 
knowledge 
he was very upset and said it had to include heating oil or 
nothing at all dukakis said

gold futures prices rose sharply and oil futures soared 
wednesday in moves that analysts said were inspired more by 
technical factors than developments in the persian gulf 
on other commodity markets copper futures rallied grains and 
soybeans advanced and grains and soybeans were mostly higher 
gold futures settled 450 to 480 higher on new yorks 
commodity exchange with the contract for delivery in october at 
39390 a troy ounce silver was 07 cent to 11 cents higher with 
october at 469 a troy ounce 
on the new york mercantile exchange light sweet crude oil 
settled 74 cents to 337 higher with november at 3732 a barrel 
wholesale heating oil was 255 cents to 738 cents higher with 
november at 9941 cents a gallon wholesale unleaded gasoline ended 
159 cents to 621 cents higher with november at 9314 cents a 
gallon 
the advances in both the precious metal and energy markets 
resembled similar runups that have occurred whenever tensions 
increased significantly in the 2monthold usiraqi confrontation 
in the middle east but this time there was no news to trigger the 
surge in prices 
instead analysts linked the rise in prices mainly to bullish 
chart patterns and perceptions that recent losses were overdone 
it was more technical than anything else said tom bentz 
director of petroleum trading for united energy inc 
he said crude oil opened moderately higher in reaction to 
tuesdays american petroleum institute report of 
lowerthanexpected us crude supplies then held fairly steady 
for several hours until the november price edged above 3560 a 
barrel the opening price of the previous session 
then it seemed like it started to snowball bentz said 
buying started coming in and that started bringing more technical 
buying back into the market 
golds advance also was a mostly technical affair analysts 
said although signs of some largescale bullion purchases lent 
strength to futures 
peter cardillo director of commodity trading with jesup 
josephthal amp co said the rally reflected investor confidence in 
the market after the december gold contract bounced off the 390 
level tuesday december gold settled at 39390 tuesday and at 
39850 wednesday 
technical factors and concerns about nearterm supply tightness 
helped boost copper futures prices on the commodity exchange 
copper settled 125 cents to 345 cents higher with october at 
130 a pound 
soybean futures prices climbed sharply on the chicago board of 
trade leading grain futures higher amid talk that the soviet union 
was on an international agricultural buying binge 
the rumors were partially confirmed after the close when the 
agriculture department reported a sale of 150000 metric tons of 
us soybean meal to the soviets 
victor lespinasse an assistant vice president in the grain 
trading division of dean witter reynolds inc said moscow was 
rumored to have bought as much as 900000 metric tons of soybean 
meal from us south american and european suppliers and 5 million 
tons of grain from canada 
the soviets also were said to have bought as much as 8 million 
metric tons of various agricultural commodities from all over the 
world since tuesday lespinasse said 
soybean meal for october delivery rocketed 8 to 18350 a ton 
wheat futures settled 1 cents to 3 cents higher with december 
at 274 a bushel corn was 2 cents to 3 cents higher with 
december at 229 a bushel oats were cent to 1 cents higher 
with december at 123 a bushel soybeans were 4 cents to 13 
cents higher with november at 620 a bushel 
most pork belly futures rose the permitted daily limit of 2 
cents a pound on the chicago mercantile exchange for the third 
straight day reflecting rising cash prices and heavy usage of 
frozen stocks analysts said 
the belly market lent strength to hog futures but cattle futures 
finished narrowly mixed after a day of choppy trading amid 
conflicting perceptions about the cash markets future direction 
live cattle finished 15 cent lower to 30 cent higher with 
october at 7992 cents a pound feeder cattle were 07 cent lower 
to 28 cent higher with october at 8775 cents a pound live hogs 
were unchanged to 1 cent higher with october at 5660 cents a 
pound frozen pork bellies were 193 cents to 2 cents higher with 
february at 6420 cents a pound

oil shot up more than 3 per barrel wednesday 
as war worries returned to the futures market in a rally that 
proved surprising even to traders who have grown accustomed to wild 
swings 
it wasnt one headline said ron caples a broker with 
shearson lehman brothers inc it wasnt one speech or one action 
or one rumor the easiest way to describe it is the war premium is 
back at least for today i dont want to go out on a limb and 
predict prices tomorrow 
contracts for november delivery of light sweet crude oil closed 
337 higher at 3732 per barrel on the new york mercantile 
exchange 
later contract months all closed higher as oil made a 
substantial rebound from backtoback dives monday and tuesday that 
totaled more than 5 a barrel 
oil had opened slightly stronger wednesday on an industry report 
showing the nations crude supply went down by 94 million barrels 
last week as well as news that secretary of state james a baker 
iii said he had found growing international support for a military 
strike against iraq 
but after several hours of lackluster trading oil suddenly 
began surging ahead late in the afternoon led by strong buying 
from the large trading houses the reason for the jump seemed to 
elude professional traders 
the rally may have been helped by news that iraqi president 
saddam hussein had gone to kuwait the oilrich nation he conquered 
in august 
a lot of people are feeling if he was down there then maybe 
he was planning new strategies with his generals or whatever 
said thomas blakeslee an energy analyst with pegasus econometric 
group inc in hoboken nj 
others said saddams visit to the occupied territory could not 
fully explain the rally 
home heating oil and unleaded gasoline contracts followed crude 
futures as they have throughout the volatile week 
heating oil rose 738 cents to 9941 cents per gallon for 
november delivery with later months all closing higher 
unleaded gasoline went up 621 cents to 9314 cents per gallon 
fo november delivery with later months closing higher 
natural gas contracts all traded higher with november contracts 
rising 35 cents to 1915 per 1000 cubic feet

the government will take over a luxury highrise 
development that borrowed almost 159 million in federally backed 
money in what officials called the biggest federal mortgage 
insurance program bailout 
federal housing officials and developers of the financially 
troubled presidential towers apartments failed to meet an oct 1 
deadline to agree on a proposed 16 million loan to help the 
project stay solvent both sides said wednesday 
the money would have forestalled a default on loans developers 
obtained to build the 2346unit highrise which opened in 1985 on 
the west edge of the citys downtown 
the federal government now must repay the loans and take over as 
lender spokesmen for both sides indicated 
the tab is the biggest in the history of the federal housing 
administrations mortgage insurance program said bill glavin a 
spokesman for the department of housing and urban development 
which oversees the fha 
glavin said hud hopes to foreclose on the project in six months 
when hud takes over such a project it generally sells the 
property he added 
douglas r woodworth a spokesman for the developers said they 
would try to negotiate an arrangement we think would be less 
costly to the government than a foreclosure 
such a deal could occur under a special program that would allow 
huds immediate payout to be limited to 40 million reducing the 
first mortgage by that amount the developers would owe the 40 
million to hud as a second mortgage they would pay later woodworth 
said 
hud would gain by not having to take a large loss at one time to 
its insurance fund but could suffer greater losses in the future 
developers daniel e levin james p mchugh and daniel j shannon 
would gain by buying time until the project becomes 
selfsustaining which hud said could take up to eight years 
hud secretary jack kemp favored the 16 million bailout only if 
the developers could raise 13 million of their own which glavin 
said they could not or would not do 
kemp said in chicago last month that there should never have 
been this type of federally guaranteed investment as the one that 
backed loans to presidential towers 
the 48story fourbuilding complex was built over the 
objections of community activists who said it would displace many 
poor and homeless people 
it is about 90 percent occupied its 3100 tenants are mostly 
young professionals and should not be affected by the projects 
latest financial troubles woodworth said

sen john glenn met privately with the senate 
ethics committee on wednesday and said he thoroughly discussed all 
aspects of his assistance for charles h keating jr while the 
businessmans savings and loan was collapsing 
glenn one of five senators who intervened with regulators for 
keating and also accepted political donations from him met with 
the committee in private for 2 hours he later declined to reveal 
the substance of the discussions 
i survived the ohio democrat told reporters i 
appreciated very much the fact that the committee would take the 
time to discuss this whole issue with me which we did there was 
adequate time to present everything 
the committees vice chairman sen warren rudman rnh said 
no decision on glenns case had been made 
glenn was the first of the five senators summoned to a committee 
meeting to explain their help for keating 
appearing individually at closed hearings this week and next 
the senators will explain their intervention with us banking 
regulators and their acceptance of a total of 13 million in 
political donations from keating and his associates 
congressional sources speaking on condition of anonymity have 
said committee special counsel robert s bennett recommended cases 
be dismissed against glenn and john mccain of arizona the only 
republican among the five mccain is scheduled to appear thursday 
the sixmember committee has not acted on bennetts 
recommendation nor on his conclusion that cases proceed against 
democratic sens alan cranston of california dennis deconcini of 
arizona and donald w riegle jr of michigan 
a decision to continue any of the cases could bring hearings in 
which bennett and defense lawyers would oppose each other in a 
triallike setting the committee would sit as a jury 
the panel has the authority to rebuke by letter any senator 
found in violation of standards of conduct or it could recommend 
full senate sanctions of censure or expulsion 
keating and his associates donated 200000 in the fall of 1985 
and spring of 1986 to the national council on public policy a 
political action committee that promoted glenns issues and paid 
for travel after his 1984 presidential bid collapsed 
glenn also received 34000 in direct contributions for his 
campaigns 
bennetts report according to congressional sources makes 
connections between the timing of keatings contributions and 
actions taken by the senators 
the conclusion was there was no connection between the 
contributions and actions of glenn and mccain one source said 
earlier this week 
federal regulators had already concluded that keatings lincoln 
savings and loan of irvine calif was heading toward failure when 
the senators held two crucial meetings in april 1987 
the thrift wasnt seized by the government until april 1989 by 
which time the government was stuck with a bailout cost that could 
exceed 2 billion 
all the senators under investigation except riegle met april 
2 1987 with edwin j gray then chairman of the federal home loan 
bank board gray contended the senators offered a deal to aid 
keating but each lawmaker vigorously denied that account 
a week later all five senators met with the san franciscobased 
examiners who were investigating lincoln and according to a 
regulators transcript the lawmakers were told that criminal 
referrals would be made to the justice department 
it was at the second meeting according to the transcript that 
glenn made the oftquoted comment to be blunt you should charge 
them or get off their backs 
glenn has said previously that if he had learned earlier about 
the potential criminality there would have been no point in 
holding either meeting and i would not have attended i attended 
no further meetings on this subject nor did i discuss the matter 
further with any member of the fhlbb or its staff 
at another point glenn said that if keating thought campaign 
contributions would buy influence then john glenn must have been 
the biggest disappointment to him than anybody he contributed to

state utility regulators concerned about 
lewd parties for nynex employees and vendors that included 
prostitutes authorized a study wednesday into whether the 
telephone holding company should be broken up 
the study was recommended by the chief lawyer to the state 
public service commission william cowan in part to try to prevent 
future conventions such as the ones held in florida by nynexs 
materiel enterprises co 
materiel enterprises was the purchasing subsidiary of nynex the 
regional baby bell company that owns new york telephone co and 
new england telephone co at the time of the parties materiel 
enterprises was not government regulated as are the telephone 
companies 
the regulatory commission is investigating whether vendors who 
attended the annual weeklng bashes may have received special 
treatment when they later pursued business deals with materiel 
enterprises 
new york telephone had been ordered to purchase supplies from 
materiel enterprises at higher prices than the company would have 
paid on the open market state attorney general robert abrams has 
charged those higher costs may have been passed on to customers 
through higher rates he said 
in february the federal communications commission ordered fines 
totaling 14 million against new york telephone and new england 
telephone because of 1185 alleged overcharges made to the two 
units by materiel enterprises 
new york telephone is asking for a 900 million rate increase 
the utility commission said wednesday it would separate the 
materiel enterprises case from the rate hike case because it might 
take too long to complete its materiel enterprises investigation 
nynex in a twoparagraph statement said divestiture was not 
an option it would consider but the company said it would 
cooperate with the commission in resolving the problems cited by 
the report 
nynex stock fell 75 cents a share to close at 7162 in 
consolidated new york stock exchange trading wednesday 
previously nynex spokesman peter goodale has said that an 
analysis of the companys dealings with its vendors found no 
correlation between the amount of business awarded and attendance 
at the conventions 
in his report to the utility commission cowan said he believed 
that customers could be better served if new york telephone was 
split off from nynex 
the manner in which this corporation nynex has handled 
itself since divestiture in 1984 raises serious and troubling 
questions about its management agenda its business purposes and 
the future direction in which it will lead the new york telephone 
co unless changes are made cowan said 
it was unclear wednesday whether the utility commission has the 
authority to order nynex to divest new york telephone 
however bradford said there were structural changes besides 
divestiture that could loosen the relationship between nynex and 
its two telephone companies 
aides to abrams called the recommendation to study a nynex 
breakup a bombshell they said it had not been tried in any 
other states 
utility commissioner james mcfarland while not endorsing the 
notion of divestiture said the nynex purchasing practices 
involving materiel enterprises were full of chicanery and 
venality if not criminality 
the annual booze and sex blasts were arranged by materiel 
enterprises executive lawrence friedman who was fired in 1988 by 
nynex 
friedman later received a 1 million settlement from nynex after 
suing the company for alleged religious discrimination nynex said 
it fired friedman for misconduct while friedman claimed it was 
because he is jewish 
on tuesday nynex said it merged materiel enterprises with 
another unit nynex services co to form a new subsidiary called 
telesector resources group inc nynex said it will provide 
centralized planning marketing and purchasing to new york 
telephone and new england telephone

because the panel seems unwilling to fulfill its mission of finding 
ways to increase the value of the cosmetics company 
avon responded that its special committee will continue to 
examine alternatives to enhance stockholder value despite the

spring under which chartwell agreed not to wage a threatened proxy 
fight against avon under the settlement avon supported chartwell

senior management and the special committee for failing to show 
any desire or determination to fulfill the committees original 
charge 
the chartwell representatives said they could not sit idly by 
and condone inaction so they decided to submit their 
resignations 
we will continue to work toward finding a means to fulfill our 
obligation to all avon shareholders a means that will be 
satisfactory to avons board and management chartwells 
representatives said 
joseph rice an avon board member who is chairman of the special 
committee said in a news release that the remaining panel 
participants would continue to look at a broad range of 
alternatives nothing has been ruled out yet he said 
among the alternatives under review are a recapitalization of 
avon asset sales and sale of the entire company avon has said in 
the past 
chartwell has exerted pressure on avon on and off since last 
november a principal in chartwell john p rochon who is vice 
chairman of the makeup marketing company mary kay has made several 
takeover advances on avon

the lateseptember sales came against a time last year when 
automakers offered more attractive incentives than they did this 
year 
auto analyst david healy of barclays de zoete wedd in new york 
said the lateseptember sales rate was healthy 
cars for the 10 days were a good deal stronger than i 
figured he said truck sales look to be the weakest all year 
maybe there is a shift in car and truck mix going on because 
of gasoline prices but its a little early to tell he said 
automakers have been saying for more tan a month that they 
havent seen any effects on sales directly related to rising 
gasoline prices stemming from the mideast crisis 
nevertheless ford sales vice president robert rewey said 
wednesday consumer confidence has experienced its steepest 
decline since 1981 
for the first nine months of this year and with imported cars 
and trucks counted in automakers said their sales dropped 59 
percent compared with the same period last year car sales were 
down 6 percent and truck sales were off 57 percent 
however the underlying demand for cars and trucks has been 
strengthening in recent months healy said 
it looks like the sales rate may have bottomed out he said 
even with the middle east and scary gasoline prices and threat of 
war and big drops in consumer confidence surveys you get better 
vehicle sales now than you had for the last 12 months 
sales in the 1990 model year wound up 79 percent behind the 
1989 model year when heavy trucks are counted in later its 
likely that about 142 million cars and trucks will have been sold 
during the 12 months ending with september 
about 117 million vehicles were sold in the 1983 model year 
just after the country emerged from a recession and before the 
start of the selling boom of the mid and late1980s 
i think that the american consumers overbuying of cars in the 
late80s has finally caught up to them healy said i think a 
lot of people were staying home paying for their old cars rather 
than buying new ones 
honda can be especially pleased with sales of its accord it 
easily captured the honor of being the most popular car in the 1990 
model year with sales of 418177 that was 32 percent more than the 
ford taurus with 316906 
included in the taurus figure is a sizeable number of sales to 
fleet customers such as rental car and taxi companies honda does 
little fleet business making the difference in retail sales 
larger 
the bestselling vehicle overall though was the ford fseries 
fullsize pickup truck at 538040 for the model year the chevrolet 
ck series of fullsize pickups was second at 486104

a house subcommittee began an inquiry 
wednesday into whether a new version of limited partnerships that 
can be publicly traded hurt small often unsophisticated investors 
critics brand the investments called rollups as legalized 
embezzlement and say they should be banned industry supporters 
meanwhile concede more disclosure is needed in the often lengthy 
and baffling documents that accompany a rollup proposal 
there isnt one broker on wall street whos been in the 
business maybe two months who owns a limited partnership not one 
it is a suicidal investment for idiots scott miller told the 
finance subcommitte of the house energy and commerce committee 
miller a houston texas consultant and researcher on limited 
partnerships was among several witnesses who called for an 
outright ban of rollups which are often developed when a limited 
partnerships earnings sour 
others like mark j sletten president of the real estate 
investment association said there should be some modification of 
the rules but opposed the outright prohibition of rollups 
limited partnerships are investment vehicles usually sold 
through brokerage firms in which investors known as limited 
partners put up between 5000 and 10000 the money often goes 
towards real estate or oil and natural gas drilling projects 
in return they get income capital gains and tax benefits 
the partnerships are usually run by one or more general 
partners who bear all the responsibility for running the business 
in return for management fees and a percentage of the profits 
through the late 1980s however many partnerships have been 
losing propositions because of troubles in the real estate and 
energy markets 
as real estate values have fallen general partners of several 
limited partnerships have combined the businesses the winners and 
losers into one entity that is then publicly traded the move has 
to be approved by the limited partners 
rollups may be the only recourse left to general partners in 
the months ahead if the overall slide in real estate values 
continues said christopher l davis president of the investment 
partnership association 
it frees the limited partners from the lengthy obligation to 
stay in the partnership for five to 10 years however shares in 
the new entity are often hard to sell and the value of the original 
investment usually drops when they hit the public market 
as a rule rollups involve fraud selfdealing theft of 
limited partnership assets and all rolled together theft said 
economist and writer benjamin j stein of malibu calif 
he and other opponents said when the term of the partnership 
ends the limited partners get their money back but in a rollup 
the investment vehicle becomes perpetual and the proceeds are 
reinvested into the partnership 
they also claimed that the deck is stacked against small 
investors who may not know that the promotional materials and 
prospectus for the rollup is being paid for with their money that 
the independent investment banker who has reviewed the rollup 
is being paid by the general partner who also pays a commission to 
brokers who obtain a yes vote for the rollup 
and all of this is legal 
davis the investment partnership association said rather than 
eliminate investment partnerships limited partners should be given 
all the information they need to make intelligent decisions when 
voting on a proposed rollup 
that would include an easilly understandable summary in the 
first few pages a comparison of compensation under the exisiting 
partnership and under the proposed new entity and the ability to 
sell partnership interest both before and after a rollup 
but in his opening remarks rep edward j markey dmass the 
subcommittees chairman said current information available to 
investors is hard to wade through 
its widely acknowledged on wall street and off that 
disclosure documents have become so complex and convoluted as to 
become incomprehensible to all but the most sophisticated 
investors he said 
markey said he and rep mike synar dokla have asked the 
securities and exchange commission to study the issue and report 
back to congress

consumer electronics giant matsushita electric 
industries co said thursday its executives begin meeting with mca 
inc officials as the japanese firm pursues a buyout of the 
entertainment conglomerate 
until now we have been approached by mca through a third 
agent but we finally reached the stage of direct negotiations 
said matsushita spokeswoman toshiko inui 
she said matsushita will send its executives to the united 
states soon to negotiate with mca representatives for a possible 
agreement 
ms inui would not elaborate on the negotiations 
the nihon keizai shimbun japans leading economic journal 
reported thursday that matsushita wants to buy mcas film and music 
divisions for 6 billion that leaves out mcas themepark 
business 
the nihon keizai said mca has told matsushita that it wants more 
than 753 billion for all of its divisions except its television 
stations 
if realized the deal would be the largest purchase of an 
american firm by a japanese company 
matsushita said in a press release it is possible that contacts 
between the two companies may not lead to a merger or even another 
form of business partnership 
with its 163 consolidated subsidiaries matsushita electric is 
japans third largest corporation and the worlds 16th largest in 
1989 according to fortune magazine 
the companys annual report forecasts total sales of more than 
44 billion dollars this year 
last year sony corp acquired columbia pictures entertainment 
in large part to gain control over the american movie studios rich 
library of old films and television shows 
analysts say purchases of film libraries allow consumer 
electronics companies to release old movies and television shows in 
the format for videotape recorders they manufacture a key sales 
strategy and also provide material for future highdefinition 
television recordings 
mcas stock rose 387 to 6350 on the new york stock exchange 
wednesday mca was trading for about 34 per share before reports 
of a possible deal surfaced sept 25 matsushitas stock has risen 
to 1920 yen 14 on oct 3 from 1630 yen 12 on sept 25 on
