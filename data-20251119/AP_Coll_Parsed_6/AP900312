cesar gaviria trujillo who wants to 
eliminate drug trafficking end government corruption and help the 
poor was easily leading in the presidential primary of the 
governing liberal party according to election results late monday 
besides the presidential primary colombians also chose a 
congress mayors city councilmen and state assemblies in sundays 
elections 
presidential elections take place may 26 
with 43 percent of the total vote counted the national 
elections office said gaviria had 1310000 votes or 48 percent of 
the total cast for all six liberal party presidential candidates 
in second place was former bogota mayor hernando duran with 636593 
votes or 23 percent third was sen ernesto samper with 488297 
votes or 18 percent 
vote tallying was delayed because the computer system broke 
down and counting proceeded by hand in this south american country 
of 30 million people 
the major radio networks rcn and caracol said exit polls 
indicated two former guerrillas won mayoral contests in small towns 
gaviria was campaign manager of sen luis carlos galan a 
popular presidential candidate who was slain in bogota last aug 18 
by drug traffickers 
with the only other major contender the conservative party 
weakened by infighting and represented by rodrigo lloreda 47 who 
has failed two previous attempts to be president there is little 
doubt gaviria will be elected 
at 43 gaviria would be colombias youngest president ever 
the choice of the liberal partys presidential candidate was the 
most important part of the elections as colombia faces threats from 
drug traffickers leftist guerrillas and right wing death squads 
samper and the other liberal party contenders for the 
presidential nomination had indicated they wanted to negotiate with 
drug traffickers and end the 6monthold war between drug barons 
and government security forces 
one liberal party presidential aspirant alberto santofimio who 
took the most vigorous antius position called for an end to the 
war against traffickers 
gaviria acknowledged late sunday that his probable victory 
stemmed from galans popularity he promised to follow galans 
program of attempting to wipe out drug trafficking 
however he suggested he may prefer to try drug traffickers in 
colombia rather than send them to the united states for trials 
something the traffickers fear greatly 
gaviria also promised to follow galans programs for a more 
equitable justice system which usually favors the wealthy and 
influential and to try to create more schools jobs housing and 
better living conditions for the poor 
previous colombian presidents have not given much importance to 
solving problems of the poor failure to face those problems has 
resulted in rapid growth of leftist guerrilla insurrection 
it was the first time the liberal party leaders did not choose 
the presidential candidate usually the choice is based upon 
reports from local powerbrokers who show they can deliver votes 
according to exit polls by networks the liberal party appeared 
to have won 60 percent of the seats in the 313member congress the 
conservative party appeared headed for 37 percent of the seats 
while leftist parties are expected to win 3 percent rcn and 
caracol said 
currently congressional seats have a breakdown of 57 percent 
liberal and 37 percent conservative with the balance held by 
leftists 
former leftist guerrillas of the april 19 movement appeared to 
have won two of the 1005 mayoral races rcn and caracol said 
the group known as the m19 surrendered its weapons last week 
in an impressive ceremony that marked the first time a guerrilla 
organization voluntarily ended its violence in colombias three 
decades of armed insurrection 
there are five other guerrilla groups none of which reached 
peace terms with the government 
juan caicedo a liberal was elected mayor in the capital 
bogota a city of 6 million people according to the radio reports 
president virgilio barco ends his fouryear term aug 7 by law 
he is ineligible to run for a second consecutive term

gov gaston caperton made some progress 
with union officials monday in a bid to end west virginias first 
teacher strike a spokesman said 
earlier in the day about 1000 teachers and their supporters 
rallied at the capitol and one county threatened to fire teachers 
who dont return to work 
caperton met with kayetta meadows president of the 
16000member west virginia education association and bob brown 
president of the 3000member west virginia federation of teachers 
behind closed doors for about seven hours the meeting ended at 11 
pm 
caperton spokesman gc morse said no agreement had been reached 
to end the strike but the two sides were closer to a settlement 
than they have been in the past few days 
morse declined to elaborate on the talks he said discussions 
would resume at 7 am tuesday brown would not comment after the 
meeting and meadows said only that she was tired but willing to 
continue talks 
it is my hope and desire that we can put aside the harsh words 
and miscommunications of the past weekend and move on to the 
resolution of the present predicament caperton said in a news 
release issued before the meeting i hope that this discussion 
will be framed in realistic and practical terms 
as the meeting continued inside the capitol hundreds of 
teachers clad in red as a sign of solidarity gathered outside under 
a huge banner reading governor lead us dont fight us 
this isnt fun but it is necessary said keith geiger 
president of the 2 millionmember national education association 
with which the wvea is affiliated you must stick together until 
a resolution is there 
teachers went on strike last wednesday after the governor failed 
to provide educators with a raise in his 199091 proposed budget 
by monday the strike had spread to 46 of the states 55 
counties forcing officials in 29 counties to cancel classes for 
nearly 150000 of the states 328445 pupils 
the meeting came after talks between the two sides broke down 
over the weekend 
leaders of the education association said they had been ready to 
call off the walkout saturday but urged members to remain on 
strike accusing the governor of reneging on the terms of a 
settlement 
the teachers said they wont go back to work until the governor 
promises to call a special legislative session to consider pay 
raises the governor said he wont call a special session until the 
teachers go back to work 
assocation members voted saturday on a proposal to return to 
work for 30 days during which time caperton would call a special 
session 
but caperton termed a total lie any claim that he promised 
to call such a session meadows said the governor gave teachers no 
choice but to stay on strike 
in greenbrier county in the southeastern section of the state 
the board of education told striking teachers monday they would be 
fired if they didnt return to work by wednesday 
state attorney general roger tompkins said last week the 
teachers strike is illegal and teachers could be fired or otherwise 
disciplined 
in jefferson county in the northeast circuit judge thomas 
steptoe issued an injunction ordering county teachers to return to 
classrooms by thursday 
the county board of education asked for the injunction after 
teachers there voted to go on strike last thursday steptoe said 
teachers could be fined and held in contempt of court if they 
didnt return by the deadline 
carolyn spangler a spokeswoman for the state board of 
education said she knew of no similar action at county or state 
levels 
in ohio county in the northern panhandle classes were canceled 
when officials found most of the districts 47 school buses had 
flat tires said superintendent h lawrence jones jones said it 
was unclear who was responsible 
in classrooms and on picket lines teachers blasted caperton and 
the news media saying a failure to communicate has been a major 
problem in settling the strike 
at charlestons capitol high school only about 400 of the 
schools 1300 students showed up for classes 
i dont like it because weve been wasting our time said 
shawna adkins a sophomore at capitol all we do is watch movies 
and we can do that at home

the five permanent members of the un security 
council met privately monday in their third round of discussions 
since january on a formula to end the 11yearold cambodian civil 
war 
the diplomats from france the united states soviet union 
china and britain were expected to focus on the failure of a 
meeting of the four warring factions two weeks ago 
in january the five security council members supported large 
parts of an australian plan to put cambodia under un 
administration until free elections were held they met again in 
new york last month 
analysts believe the australian plan offers the best chance in 
years of ending the conflict but the meeting of the combatants in 
jakarta indonesia produced no agreement on major issues 
factions involved are the government of premier hun sen 
installed by vietnam and the resistance coalition of three parties 
the khmer rouge a communist group that is the strongest 
guerrilla organization and noncommunist insurgent forces led by 
prince norodom sihanouk cambodias former ruler and son sann a 
former premier 
hun sen and vietnams foreign minister nguyen co thach said 
one reason the jakarta talks failed was the opposition of khieu 
samphan a khmer rouge leader and vice president of the guerrilla 
coalition to using the word genocide to describe khmer rouge 
rule of cambodia in 197578 
the khmer rouge government led by pol pot killed hundreds of 
thousands of cambodias 8 million people in the process of trying 
to create a new agrarian society a vietnamese invasion in december 
1978 overthrew the pol pot regime 
australias plan also is intended to break a deadlock at the 
19nation paris talks in august which foundered largely on the 
question of how power could be shared until election the 
australians suggested sidestepping the question by putting the 
country under an interim un administration with peacekeeping 
forces to police a ceasefire 
all factions appear to accept some un role including election 
supervision but there is disagreement over how cambodia should be 
governed until the elections are held 
hun sen and his vietnamese backers say dismantling his 
government might open the way for the khmer rouge to seize power 
again 
sihanouk and son sann have welcomed the australian proposal 
khmer rouge spokesmen have expressed reservations about it but 
have not taken a formal position 
under the australian plan the former french colonys un seat 
would be declared vacant until a new government was formed in phnom 
penh after elections the plan would cost an estimated 987 million 
for a year and involve 12190 peacekeepers and outside officials 
attending the paris talks are richard solomon us 
undersecretary of state david gillmore undersecretary in the 
british foreign office claude martin frances director of asian 
affairs igor rogachev of the soviet union and xu dunxin of china 
vice ministers of foreign affairs and rafeeuden ahmed a un

a high school art teacher shot his wife and 
daughters to death as they slept monday then killed himself 
authorities said 
grade school principal dean collins asked the sheriffs office 
to check on the family when joe pianalto 33 didnt report for 
work and his daughters annie 8 and jennifer 6 didnt report to 
school 
sheriff don panzer said he found shirley pianalto 35 dead in 
her bed with a gunshot wound to the back of the head the children 
were in their bed also dead of head wounds 
pianaltos body was behind the girls bed a hunting rifle at 
his side panzer said the teachers wound appeared to be 
selfinflicted the sheriff said 
the county coroner dr leo meduna estimated that the deaths 
occurred between 3 am and 4 am monday 
everybody is just absolutely horrified about what has taken 
place here panzer said what were trying to find out is what 
possibly could have triggered him to do such a thing 
the family moved to this northcentral kansas town about 35 
miles northwest of salina three or four years ago 
the last homicide in this rural community of about 1600 people 
occurred in 1977 when a missouri fugitive held a couple and their 
teenage son hostage for several hours before shooting them and 
killing himself panzer said

deposed haitian leader prosper avril stopped at a 
us air force base monday before flying to an unknown destination 
as haitian exiles cautiously celebrated his ouster and called for 
his execution 
avril a lieutenant general and his family arrived aboard a 
us c141 transport plane at homestead air force base 25 miles 
south of miami at 820 am and left at 330 pm 
avril departed in personally arranged transportation said 
maj bob barca a homestead spokesman he declined to comment 
further 
a us government official speaking on condition he not be 
identified said avril left florida asked if he was flown out the 
official responded that would be correct 
lt col darrell hayes an air force spokesman in washington 
said earlier that avril was going to be driven to boca raton and 
left on his own after reaching the affluent palm beach county 
city but city officials said they were assured by federal 
officials that avril wasnt coming there 
area haitians said avrils son attended college in miami until 
recently and moved to a home west of boca raton the sunsentinel 
in fort lauderdale reported tuesday 
white house spokesman marlin fitzwater said earlier that avril 
indicated he planned to stay in the miami area a few days and 
that his future was still under discussion 
a group of haitian exiles demonstrated briefly outside the us 
attorneys office in miami to call for avrils indictment dozens 
more gathered outside the haitian refugee center in miamis little 
haiti neighborhood listening to radio reporters and speakers 
avril pa mourin avril isnt dead some chanted in haitian 
creole the frenchafrican language spoken by most haitians most 
speakers called for avrils capture trial in haiti and execution 
for allegedly ordering the slayings of civilians and opposition 
leaders 
the crowd became larger and livelier as nightfall neared but 
the overall mood seemed more anxious than boisterous after four 
years of instability and dashed hopes in their caribbean homeland 
the mood contrasted with nearriotous celebrations that broke out 
on feb 7 1986 when jeanclaude baby doc duvalier fled haiti 
ending his familys 29year rule 
everybody is happy but we are still watching said pierre 
joseph 30 who said hes been in florida 10 years nothing 
changed yet maybe if we have elections then it will change 
a dozen haitians stood vigil outside the homestead base gates 
when word began circulating that avril was on his way 
were here to tell him hes not welcome in this society in 
this country said exile jeanpierre louis we want him to be 
tried and imprisoned and even executed like ceaucescu in romania 
louis said us hospitality for avril was unwelcome but the 
rev gerard jeanjuste a longtime fiery leader in the south 
florida exile community that numbers at least 150000 urged cool 
heads 
leading the demonstration outside the us attorneys office he 
said avril should be indicted and jailed on drug charges as was 
deposed panama leader gen manuel antonio noriega in federal 
custody near here since his own arrival at homestead on jan 4 
the haitian military has been linked to shipments of south 
american cocaine to florida but there has been no indication that 
us authorities might charge avril 
as far as any charges are concerned this office will attempt 
to bring an indictment if there is sufficient evidence and 
information to justify it said diane cossin executive assistant 
to us attorney dexter lehtinen she suggested anyone with such 
information turn it over to the drug enforcement administration 
jeanjuste twice this year led demonstrations at miami 
international airport when avril was in transit during an official 
visit to taiwan the exiles there were ordered by police to 
disperse after threatening to grab avril and take him to little 
haiti for a peoples trial 
i am very optimistic this time i think there are new factors 
in the equation jeanjuste said 
he said he was most encouraged by the apparent role the us 
ambassador state department and white house played in easing avril 
out many haitian exiles have expressed bitterness about us 
policy toward haiti and haitian immigration which is to consider 
most haitians attempting to leave their impoverished nation to be 
economic refugees and subject to deportation 
this is a miracle for us to see many of the us officials 
helping get the rights of the haitian people jeanjuste said 
he said haitians were trying to learn more about ertha 
pascaltrouillot the supreme court judge designated by the 
opposition coalition to head a provisional civilian government 
she had ties to the duvalier regime jeanjuste said but added 
if the haitian people accept her we will accept her we will be 
very cautious 
he doubted there would be a mass reverse exodus to haiti if 
democracy comes he said haiti doesnt have the infrastructure to 
support a surge of returning exiles most of whom send us dollars 
home jeanjuste said he would encourage exiles to go back 
temporarily to help and to take goods not available in haiti

was joseph hazelwood drunk or sober 
when the exxon valdez ran aground a defense witness said a 
toxicologist for the prosecution probably cant tell because 
there are too many unknown variables 
thomas burr an alcohol and drug testing consultant from 
minneapolis noted monday that hazelwood underwent only one blood 
test 10 hours after the grounding and it is not known whether he 
drank after the grounding 
burr called by the defense criticized conclusions reached by 
richard prouty an oklahoma toxicologist who testified hazelwood 
probably was drunk when his tanker rammed a jagged reef in the 
nations worst oil spill 
prouty used a method known as retrograde extrapolation 
which seeks to determine a persons drunkenness at an earlier hour 
through backward calculations based on blood tests 
but burr said hes never heard of anyone counting backwards 10 
hours with only one blood test 
its very dubious when its based on a single chemical test 
he said in my opinion its not a valid thing to do forensically 
especially not for such a long period of time there are too 
many unknown variables 
burr said the method is controversial in the scientific 
community 
taking proutys calculations to their extreme burr said they 
could have shown that hazelwood had a 30 blood alcohol reading 
when he boarded the ship making him unable to walk straight 
at levels of 30 100 percent of people are visibly and 
noticeably intoxicated burr said he faced crossexamination 
today 
witnesses have said hazelwood was steady on his feet and except 
for liquor on his breath showed no signs of intoxication after a 
day ashore in valdez there is a conflict in testimony on how much 
he drank while in town 
earlier monday another defense expert witness shiras walker 
testified under crossexamination that the grounding of the massive 
tanker would not have occurred if hazelwood had stayed on the 
bridge 
but walker a former tanker captain said the skippers 
departure to his quarters was not unusual and did not cause the 
disaster walker said if he had things to do below and had an able 
third mate he wouldnt hesitate to leave either 
i walked several thousand miles in captain hazelwoods 
shoes the experienced seaman said 
ultimately walker blamed third mate gregory cousins for the 
wreck he suggested it was cousins job to see that hazelwoods 
orders were followed by the helmsman who failed to carry out the 
ordered 10degree right rudder turn 
probably anybody above the age of 5 could have carried that 
out the witness said 
if there were problems walker said the third mate had a 
telephone to call hazelwood in his cabin all he had to say was 
captain come to the bridge and this whole thing would have been 
avoided he testified 
hazelwood 43 of huntington ny was the only crew member of 
the exxon valdez charged in the wreck which spilled nearly 11 
million gallons of oil 
he is accused of criminal mischief reckless endangerment 
operating a vessel while intoxicated and negligent discharge of 
oil if convicted he could receive up to 7 years in prison and 
61000 in fines 
isnt it true that if captain hazelwood was on the bridge 
where he was supposed to be this wouldnt have happened 
assistant district attorney mary anne henry asked during 
crossexamination 
i might disagree with that supposed to be part said 
walker but if captain hazelwood was on the bridge during those 
maneuvers this accident wouldnt have happened 
but when defense attorney michael chalos asked whether he felt 
hazelwoods absence from the bridge contributed to the disaster in 
any way the witness responded none at all 
the former captain told jurors the only regulation he knows of 
requiring a captain to be on the bridge is during passage through 
the panama canal

the white house has agreed an 8 billion super 
collider is well worth building but taxpayers not foreign 
countries will probably pick up most of the extra 2 billion cost 
deputy energy secretary w henson moore said monday 
moore said the energy department does not expect texas to 
contribute beyond the 1 billion it has pledged toward building the 
particle accelerator south of dallas and is also not counting on 
much more foreign help than was expected when the colliders price 
was 59 billion 
the department said last year that it expected to finance 
onethird of the then59 billion project which would be the 
worlds largest scientific instrument through nonfederal sources 
1 billion from texas and close to another 1 billion from 
foreign countries 
design changes have since forced the price up as high as 8 
billion moore said although the energy department wont have a 
firm figure until july or august 
the collider is a 53miles around tunnel that will whirl beams 
of protons into each other to test exotic theories on the origin of 
matter 
at a meeting friday at the white house with moore energy 
secretary james d watkins and three presidential advisers it was 
determined that we did not think it was possible to gain more 
nonfederal money than what we had contemplated moore said 
and so we concluded to that meeting at the white house the 
increase will be soley borne by the federal government and there 
was little chance if any of that increase would come from any 
place else moore told a news conference 
the three advisers at the meeting were john sununu white house 
chief of staff richard darman director of the office of 
management and budget and allan bromley assistant to the 
president for science and technology

twentytwo years after covenant house started 
sheltering children from the streets the nations largest program 
for young runaways is struggling with another troubled life its 
own 
torn by allegations of sexual impropriety that forced the 
resignation of its charismatic founder the 87 millionayear 
operation has postponed some expansion plans and steeled itself for 
a drop in donations 
the scrutiny also has revealed criticism from a new source 
social welfare professionals who question its style of service 
critics agree covenant house helps fill the urgent need of 
sheltering homeless youths each night about 2000 runaways sleep 
in its centers in six us cities latin america and canada 
but some say covenant houses main thrust shortterm stays in 
institutional settings represents triage rather than treatment 
others complain that its roman catholic philosophy precludes sex 
education that could help stem the spread of aids 
some critics accuse its counselors of harassing homosexual 
youths and others charge the organization with institutional 
arrogance saying it virtually ignores other privately operated 
programs 
they fill the hallways and then call the press in and say 
theres kids on the floor we need more money said marion 
reidel clinical director at the emergency shelter a much smaller 
program for runaways in new york theyre notorious for not 
networking with the other programs in town 
since december a series of former clients has stepped forward 
to accuse covenant houses 62yearold founder the rev bruce 
ritter of sexual misconduct 
one youth claimed to have received money and gifts from ritter 
and covenant house has conceded trying to start him off in a new 
life by giving him the identity of a dead 10yearold boy without 
asking the dead boys parents ritter has denied wrongdoing but 
franciscan officials ordered him to take a leave of absence while 
they investigated on feb 27 he resigned the next day 
prosecutors said they had found questionable financial 
transactions at covenant house but none meriting prosecution 
covenant house gets 95 percent of its funds from private 
donations relying on appeals written by ritter and mailed monthly 
to 800000 past or potential supporters 
donations fell recovered and fell again as the allegations 
surfaced and subsided now covenant house officials are uncertain 
and deeply worried about the effect of ritters departure 
theres a real question as to whether covenant house will be 
able to grow and expand as it has or whether covenant house will 
be put into a period of retrenchment for some time said frank 
macchiarola who served briefly as acting president before 
resigning also on feb 27 because of friction with the 
organizations board 
covenant house operates large shelters in new york new orleans 
houston los angeles fort lauderdale fla anchorage alaska and 
toronto and orphanagestyle shelters in mexico honduras 
guatemala and panama 
plans to establish a shelter in washington are on hold but 
expansions in los angeles and new orleans are proceeding and a 
counseling center in dallas just opened 
despite the organizations longstanding practice of spending 
almost all of each years income covenant house officials said its 
finances are basically sound and no cutbacks are envisioned 
but the criticism of its programs appears likely to continue 
we have this kind of mixed feeling toward the covenant 
house said fred griesbach head of the coalition for the 
homeless 
while the rate of aids is astronomical among runaways 
greisbach said covenant house does not encourage using condoms to 
stem the diseases spread but instead counsels abstinence 
theyre not going to deal with it in what i think is a 
rational way he said we think its counterproductive you 
need to talk about condoms about abortion about birth control 
that goes beyond abstinence 
macchiarola said covenant houses handling of birth control and 
sex education is guided by principle the policy we follow is 
church policy he said we have to proceed off what we think is 
right 
covenant houses main purpose is to provide emergency shelter 
for a few days or weeks to runaways who often return to the street 
but critics say smaller more intensive programs have more success 
helping youngsters find a new life 
young people are supposed to be in a familytype 
environment reidel said theyre not supposed to be 
institutionalized they dont belong in large buildings 
covenant houses manhattan shelter in tawdry times square 
fails to remove youngsters from the dangers and temptations of 
street life and is too big for effective individual counseling she 
said 
the manhattan shelter was designed for 250 youths but often 
sleeps more than 300 some on rollout pads in lounges macchiarola 
said covenant houses reluctance to refer youths elsewhere reflects 
its opendoor policy 
the moment our people think they should refer kids elsewhere 
is the moment weve taken a different attitude he said 
after a brief stay twothirds of the shelters visitors return 
to the street where some meet an early death from drugs disease 
or violence the others return to families find their own place to 
live or enter longterm residential programs 
covenant house also operates a 150bed longterm residence in 
new york and other organizations run similar smaller programs 
and there are advantages to that smallness said susan 
mullgrav special projects director at the city department of youth 
services its more personalized its more individualized 
yet given the scope of the problem with an estimated 100000 
to 300000 homeless runaway youths nationwide mullgrav and others 
concede large shelters do fill the most urgent needs a bed a meal 
and someone to talk to 
covenant house has been necessary in spite of their 
programmatic problems because theyre one of the few agencies that 
has that number of beds said reidel it is better than 
sleeping on the streets

they fought and suffered they saw 
their comrades killed and wounded and their own lives crippled by 
bullets or bombs now they feel their sacrifice and achievement are 
going unrecognized 
dona violeta talks about everyone but us complained 
commandante wilmer a regional chief of the contra insurgency 
based in the hills here on the border with nicaragua 
nicaraguan presidentelect violeta barrios de chamorro along 
with president daniel ortega has called for the contras to 
disband but the contras want more they want credit 
were the ones who created the conditions for dialogue among 
the central american presidents wilmer said of last years 
regional summit meetings the talks produced sandinista concessions 
on early elections and international scrutiny 
wilmer like other contras argues that the sandinistas made 
concessions only because they wanted to get rid of the pressure of 
the contra resistance although ussupported the current contra 
leadership maintains it is a homegrown insurgency that grew out of 
conditions created by the sandinistas inside nicaragua 
mrs chamorro leading a 14party alliance trounced ortega in 
the feb 25 vote that grew out of the peace process she is to take 
office april 25 
we have to be paid the respect due men who have spilled our 
blood each combatant has to know his effort has not been for 
nothing said wilmer who uses only his nomdeguerre 
the contras were defeated militarily but now feel they deserve 
credit for what turned out to be a political victory 
well return to nicaragua when were respected as combatants 
as part of the victory said jackson another young 
commandante 
asked what kind of appreciation the contras want to see from 
mrs chamorro wilmer said they would like to praised in a speech 
but it cant be limited to just words the words should be backed 
up with deeds 
he said the combatants most of whom are peasant farmers are 
not looking for government positions or handouts but they will 
need financial help to rebuild their lives back home 
wilmer 27 years old and a veteran of nine years of 
counterrevolution is a prime example of the new breed of contra 
chief the movements leadership was overhauled last year at the 
insistence of men like him who spent years in the mountains 
fighting a war that killed an estimated 30000 people 
the businesssuited contra honchos who spent most of their time 
lobbying in washington miami and tegucigalpa were pushed out 
the field commanders viewed those leaders the ones the us 
public saw posing with ronald reagan or testifying in congress 
for the most part as venal politicians insensitive to the needs and 
objectives of the fighting man 
wilmer and the members of the revamped command spend most of 
their time at this sprawling camp home for the past two years to 
about 10000 fighters and 42000 dependents a few thousand contra 
combatants operate inside nicaragua where wilmer spent several 
months prior to his return to yamales in late february 
about 3000 rebel soldiers gathered on a parade ground thursday 
to hear an address from commander ruben the top contra after 
chief of staff israel galeano known as franklin 
ruben told the troops that in the nottoodistant future they 
would parade into managua to the cheers of a thankful throng 
but just when or how the contras will demobilize and what will 
become of them after they do has emerged as the major stumbling 
block to a peaceful transition in nicaragua 
the sandinistas insist the rebel army must disarm and disband 
before inauguration day 
the contras want none of that they say they will remain armed 
and ready to make sure the leftist regime hands over power the 
army and the police forces as well as the presidential sash they 
also want their safety inside nicaragua guaranteed 
but honduras wants them out the united states agrees they must 
demobilize and mrs chamorro has limited her contact to an envoy 
who in the sleepy honduran capital of tegucigalpa declared the 
presidentelects recognition of their contribution it was 
eminently low profile 
we are a cancer nobody wants said galeano early this month 
theres no confetti and no medals said a us official 
close to the contras they sought a military satisfaction and 
werent prepared for a political satisfaction which is more 
problematical as relates to them 
the official said contra leaders complain they are as 
unappreciated as vietnam veterans were after that war ended 
when they say that i always tell them but theres a big 
difference in this case your side won

a year ago islamic fundamentalist ahmed 
kofahi had been dismissed as a university teacher and was in prison 
for criticizing the government now hes a member of parliament 
kofahi is heard regularly in state radio broadcasts of 
parliamentary debates excoriating assorted government officials 
his progress from prisoner to legislator illustrates the quiet 
changes jordan has undergone the past year 
the atmospheres different now kofahi said in an interview 
we have more freedom but its not enough 
islamic fundamentalists and leftists who won seats in the 
november elections are pressing for tough investigations of 
government corruption greater social justice and curbs on security 
agencies 
human rights are born before the human is born kofahi said 
its not a gift from a leader or a party or an authority and not 
to have these rights is equivalent to death 
jordan is bordered to the north and east by syria and iraq 
whose ruling parties brook little opposition kuwait the most 
liberal state on the arabian peninsula to the south suspended its 
parliament in 1987 
im sure the countries surrounding us are not happy about 
whats going on here said taher masri who resigned from the 
cabinet to make a successful run for parliament 
reform in this kingdom of 31 million people whose western 
neighbor is israel is more orderly and less sweeping than the 
change revolutionizing eastern europe 
as in eastern europe however popular revolt is behind it four 
days of riots last april caused by price increases and other 
grievances cost 10 lives and shocked king hussein into action 
hussein who has ruled since 1953 is relinquishing many powers 
but retains firm control and is personally popular 
in november he oversaw jordans first general elections since 
1967 which were among the freest ever held in the arab world 
the fundamentalist moslem brotherhood won the largest bloc of 
seats in the 80member parliament kofahi running on the 
brotherhood ticket got more votes than any of the other 650 
candidates 
mudar badran husseins choice for prime minister underwent an 
extraordinary grilling by legislators about his personal finances 
and professional record before winning a vote of confidence 
since last april the government has freed all prisoners held 
without charge and dozens convicted of political related crimes 
radicals who once took up arms against hussein have been allowed 
to return home and the pervasive general intelligence department 
has been stripped of its powers to withhold passports and bar 
people from travel or employment 
the government has promised to make officials accountable for 
corruption a former undersecretary of the supply ministry was 
arrested last month in a graft investigation 
badran has promised to end martial law imposed 23 years ago 
because of the 1967 middle east war and appointed lawyers to 
determine which of the decrees issued during that time should be 
abolished 
he also promised to repeal a 1935 defense law inherited from the 
british mandate that allows officials to ignore many civil rights 
the law now is used more widely in israel than in jordan 
although the 33yearold ban on political parties remains in 
force it was ignored during the election campaign the government 
says it will legalize parties after a new national charter of 
principles is submitted to a referendum probably this year 
police have not interfered with street demonstrations which 
have been few and small a 1988 decree nationalizing newspapers was 
canceled and they were returned to their former managers but 
government institutions retain majority ownership 
the government is not involved in any way in restricting the 
press information minister ibrahim izzeddine said 
all the changes have not been liberal the victory of islamic 
fundamentalists set back campaigns for westernstyle womens rights 
and encouraged censorship on moral grounds 
masri the former government minister said he is convinced 
hussein will not retreat from reforms 
jordan has had parliaments since the 1920s most were weak and 
any that showed signs of independence were suspended 
since 1948 however jordan has gone from a land of peasants and 
nomads with one high school to a nation that nearly equals sweden 
in the percentage of young people going to college or technical 
school 
with such an educated population masri said you cant hide 
anything anymore

the sheriff of this mountain county says 
hes stopped the old custom of giving away seized moonshine for 
home remedies since his arrest even though a grand jury has 
refused to indict him 
i aint done nothing nobody else had done said madison 
county sheriff dedrick brown who was arrested after giving friends 
six halfgallon jars of white lightning in front of a state 
investigator 
his supporters including republican gov jim martin say the 
practice dates back a century or more and his arrest was 
politically motivated the arrest was made by agents of the state 
bureau of investigation which is headed by a democrat 
not everyone in madison county agrees however with the grand 
jurys decision not to indict brown on charges of destroying 
criminal evidence 
if hes crooked enough to give moonshine away in front of 
somebody what else is he doing said eddie lemin hes in a 
respected position and he shouldnt be dealing with that stuff 
they ought to can him 
ann briggs doesnt like that the sheriff of a dry county was 
caught giving away alcohol moonshine is dangerous she said 
i cant see giving it out for medicinal purposes 
brown 49 says since he took office in 1986 his moonshine 
recipients have included three superior court judges he would not 
elaborate 
as far as im concerned i wont be reopening that 
tradition said the sheriff who was arrested on feb 9 a month 
after he seized 25 jugs of corn whiskey in a raid on a still 
brown an imposing 6foot6 with a graying beard was 
fingerprinted in his own jail and released 
sam googe retired sheriff of nearby mitchell county says he 
gave away moonshine after breaking illegal stills during a 20year 
career that began in 1946 its been around as long as i can 
remember he said the people thought it helped i hope it 
did 
an oldtimer in marshall verified the giveaway custom theyve 
done that ever since i was a boy said 82yearold isaac gunter 
a spoonful of liquor is the best blood builder there is 
the governor who agreed that the arrest smacks of dirty 
politics said confiscated whiskey routinely was given to charlotte 
hospitals when he was a county commissioner and davidson college 
chemistry professor in the 1960s 
about once every six months theyd have an accumulated supply 
of whiskey said martin theyd check it to see there was no 
wood alcohol in it methanol which blinds you and wed vote to 
give it to the hospitals so they could use it for medicinal 
purposes seriously 
brown born and raised in marshall which is about 20 miles 
northwest of asheville remembers being given a concoction of honey 
and corn whiskey when he was sick as a young boy 
a couple of teaspoons of whiskey every couple of hours helps 
keep the fever from dropping too fast said brown who was 
fighting a stubborn cold with whitewhiskey tea during a recent 
interview 
the sheriff a republican who upset longtime democratic sheriff 
ey ponder in 1986 is up for reelection in november while he 
has no gop opposition in the may primary three democrats are 
running 
brown said the arrest may help him in a county where democrats 
outnumber republicans more than 21 it was all done to weaken me 
so they could beat me brown said instead it has given me 
strength 
ponder 80 the countys democratic party leader denies browns 
allegation that he too gave away moonshine during his 34 years as 
sheriff i never on earth gave away evidence or whiskey 
either ponder said 
and he denies having a role in browns arrest if he says or 
implies that i had anything to do with it hes either badly 
misinformed or willfully lying 
brown arrested ponder last year after ponder shot a man in the 
back with a shotgun ponder who said the shooting occurred during 
a scuffle was not indicted 
the sbi had evidence that they were nine to 12 feet apart 
brown said

poor bonn for 41 years this sleepy 
city on the banks of the rhine has been trying to live down its 
image as one of europes least exciting capitals 
now west germanys leaders are talking about making berlin the 
capital of a united germany and bonn residents are worried about 
the future 
my customers are politicians and the whole periphery around 
them chauffeurs secretaries and tourist groups who come to see 
the government area said juergen rausch whose family has run a 
newspaper kiosk across from parliament since west germanys 
creation in 1949 
among rauschs betterknown customers are chancellor helmut kohl 
and foreign minister hansdietrich genscher 
the main source of my income would disappear if bonn were no 
longer the capital said rausch 
bonn birthplace of beethoven has many qualities 
farm tractors occasionally clank along major streets in bonns 
suburbs barges ply the rhine and people stroll on pathways along 
the easymoving river 
its a homey place in many ways theres the maternus 
restaurant for example whose owner drags out photo albums to show 
customers pictures of some of her famous guests including ronald 
reagan kohl and genscher 
a stone statue of beethoven broods over muensterplatz the 
citys quiet cobblestoned main square just a couple blocks away 
from the colorful daily farmers market 
bonn university a former 18thcentury palace with majestic 
onionshaped domes is widely respected in the fields of science 
political science history and law wolfgang paul who shared the 
nobel prize for physics with two others last year teaches and 
studies atoms at the university 
but its not fun city 
bonn has never been able to cast off its image as a provincial 
capital on saturday nights as many say the nightlife is a 
20minute autobahn drive away in cologne 
bonn is half the size of a chicago cemetery and twice as 
dead goes one old joke 
bonns image isnt helped much by uninspired government 
buildings that lack the grandeur of structures in london or paris 
bonn has 290000 residents counting politicians government 
workers bureaucrats and diplomats who live in the city because it 
is the capital berlin germanys seat of government from 1871 
until 1945 is a vibrant cosmopolitan city of 18 million 
berlin became a key hanseatic league trading center in the 14th 
century and later the seat of powerful prussian kings it emerged 
as a center of german national feeling after the napoleonic wars 
and rose to become one of the worlds great cities before the 1933 
nazi takeover 
unlike bonn berlin has many famous monuments and architectural 
treasures like the former reichstag building and brandenburg gate 
bonn has been a standin capital since 1949 with the idea that 
when german unification occurs berlin would regain the capital 
crown it lost as a result of the third reichs defeat and germanys 
postwar separation 
now with heady talk of reunification west germanys leaders 
have been saying the capital of a united germany rightfully belongs 
in berlin 
berlin is the city in which the heart and for which the 
heart of the germans beats says genscher 
the indivisible german nation must also have its heart in the 
right place that is berlin he recently told the welt am 
sonntag newspaper 
a recent poll indicated nearly threefourths of all west germans 
favor installing the capital of a united germany in berlin there 
have been no similar polls for people in east germany whose 
capital is already east berlin 
despite the popular support for berlin as capital some 
opposition politicians have said bonn should retain the title 
partly because of berlins past as the center of hitlers third 
reich 
for 12 years berlin was the capital of the brutal hitler 
dictatorship says freimut duve federal lawmaker with the 
opposition social democrats 
no one has yet formally proposed making berlin a united 
germanys capital 
and with all the complications of unification and berlin 
technically still under the control of four foreign powers the 
united states britain and france making berlin the capital could 
take some time 
government officials say billions of dollars of construction and 
remodeling work already begun in bonns government quarter will be 
completed but have left open whether plans for further projects 
will ever get off the ground 
kohl has said he would like to see berlin the capital again but 
hints that bonn could keep some crucial federal government 
responsibilities 
i am for berlin but bonn must keep important functions he 
was quoted as saying by the bild newspaper last month 
that kind of talk is worrying bonn boosters 
a group of bonn merchants selfemployed workers and scholars 
has already launched a yes to bonn lobbying campaign to keep 
their city as a united germanys capital 
they have been saying that while berlin is tainted by the nazi 
years west germanys 41 years of democracy have bloomed in bonn 
west german news media say bonn could lose nearly half its 
residents if the capital is moved to berlin and real estate prices 
in bonn have already begun to slip 
bonn city officials seem to be putting their hopes on hints by 
kohl and others that their city wont be completely forsaken 
we are just at the beginning of the capital city question 
says mayor hans j daniels

the rev angelo panigati stood 
directly under a crucifix when a bomb landed nearby gutting the 
italian embassy and sending the roman catholic priest scurrying for 
cover 
following his two dogs through a broken pane of glass into his 
chapel panigati took refuge with his pups in a corner more bombs 
came shaking the embassy grounds 
on his first sunday since last weeks bloody coup attempt the 
65yearold ruddyfaced italian prayed for the afghan people he 
appeared to give no thought to his own brush with death 
i dont believe in miracles said panigati whos been in 
afghanistan since he was 40 but im about to 
his congregation a gathering of 12 laughed on sunday 
services were moved to panigatis living room while the 
bombdamaged chapel underwent repairs 
the italian embassy and surrounding buildings were just several 
of scores of structures around kabul destroyed by bombs dropped by 
renegade fighter pilots at least 95 civilians were killed and 197 
injured in the failed coup no military casualties have been 
released 
no one was in the embassy at the time of the attack 
western missions left afghanistan a little more than a year ago 
as soviet troops withdrew after a 10year intervention wrongly 
expecting the swift collapse of president najibs government at the 
hands of moslem guerrillas kabul now has just 21 functioning 
foreign embassies 
the coup appears to have put on hold plans by some western 
countries to return planned lowlevel diplomatic visits from 
italy austria france and britain have been postponed diplomats 
say 
at the italian compound the bomb blew out windows in the 
embassy bending the reinforced steel on the windows like rubber 
windows were knocked out in the chapel 300 feet away and in 
pangatis house next door 
a crater 10 feet deep and 20 feet wide yawned opposite the 
embassy 
the fathers beloved greenhouse was also gutted 
ill just have to start it all over again he said as he 
surveyed the damage dressed in an afghan sweater and an apron 
decorated with blue ducks 
it wont be the first time 
since the civil war began in the late 1970s panigati has 
suffered rocket attacks and raining flares which soviet planes 
drop to confuse heatseeking missiles as they circle kabul 
everything seems to hit the greenhouse 
flares are the fruit of kabul he said with a chuckle 
instead of cherries or apples we get these 
the priest opened a drawer in his living room revealing a 
collection of hundreds of spent flares 
panigati belongs to the barnabites a catholic order founded in 
1533 the barnabites opened their mission in afghanistan on jan 1 
1933 following an agreement between the italian dictator benito 
mussolini the vatican and the afghan government 
fascist italy was the second government after the soviet union 
to recognize king amanullah khan so the afghan government welcomed 
italian priests 
panigatis mission has been limited to serving the foreign 
community no missionary work is allowed but the priest who 
speaks 10 languages has been allowed to teach 
all of kabuls secondary schools are closed now the war so 
he has private students 
panigati said his close call with the bomb didnt frighten him 
ive been through all of this before he said 
during world war ii a german soldier was shot in panigatis 
town and germans decided to take revenge by killing some civilians 
panigati was one of those chosen to die 
they put me against the wall to shoot me but them bombings 
began and i ran off 
later he was on his way to the dachau concentration camp when 
another bombing attack derailed the train panigati said he escaped 
into a corn field 
on thursday after the fighting ended panigati said he awoke to 
a beautiful symphony 
it was a symphony of sweeping glass he said everywhere 
around me i heard the sound and i thought lord how good it is 
for us to be here

new weapons to catch spies including rewards 
for reporting turncoat relatives and greater fbi access to tax 
records are being studied by a panel of private citizens working 
behind closed doors for the leaders of the senate intelligence 
committee 
many of the ideas under discussion revolve around money now 
the most common motivation for those who deliver us secrets to 
foreign governments 
without any public announcement nine men usually at the beck 
and call of presidents were recruited last spring by sens david 
boren dokla and william cohen rmaine chairman and vice 
chairman of the intelligence committee for a unique effort to 
respond to the decade of the spy 
most of the nine are former white house cia state or justice 
officials who cohen said not only are trusted by the nations 
intelligence officers but also can rally political support if 
controversial new laws seem needed 
in an interview cohen said he and boren want to enhance 
security measures without turning into a stalinist paranoid state 
during the 1980s the united states caught and convicted more 
spies than during the entire postworld war ii era but many 
already had worked inside the us government for decades 
undetected 
members of the panel have visited the cia fbi justice and 
defense departments national security agency and other 
intelligence agencies over the past nine months cohen said theyre 
looking for common elements of these cases and new defenses 
that sort of work normally would be done by the presidents 
national security council staff but president bushs 
administration has no counterespionage proposals on the table 
the advisers are former deputy cia director and national 
security agency chief bobby ray inman former cia director richard 
helms former carter white house counsel lloyd cutler and former 
reagan white house counsel arthur b culvahouse jr 
also former ambassador and senior state department official 
seymour weiss former ambassador and xerox executive sol linowitz 
former deputy attorney general and former deputy secretary of state 
warren christopher and borens friend eli jacobs a venture 
capitalist who owns the baltimore orioles baseball team and has 
served on defense advisory panels 
columbia university law professor harold edgar is helping draft 
legislative proposals which cohen expects in about two months 
while refusing to discuss the panels deliberations inman said 
his personal observation is that in 90 percent of the spy cases 
since 1975 americans made the initial approach to spy for 
foreign powers 
back in the 1930s and 1940s almost every case of espionage 
had one of two factors either ideological sympathy or blackmail 
inman said 
the ideological sympathy evaporated among spies even before the 
wane of communism around the world during the last year and its 
pretty hard to blackmail people for lifestyle these days inman 
said but look at the number of people who have taken money 
cohen agreed one of the weaknesses has been that we have not 
had laws on updating financial status he said if a guy goes 
from a vega to a jaguar in a years time somethings wrong 
for example navy spies john walker and jerry whitworth who 
enabled the soviets to read a million coded messages were paid 
hundreds of thousands of dollars ronald pelton sold nsa secrets 
after he nearly went broke 
an administration source said one idea floated to the panel is a 
longsought fbi goal easier access to tax records and consumer 
credit data when hunting a foreign agent fbi agents can get bank 
records in secret without having enough evidence for a criminal 
search warrant but they need such a warrant to obtain tax and 
credit data 
inman suggested that a computer list of officials with access to 
top secrets could be used by the irs to tell you if there was any 
significant change either a bankruptcy or a large gain 
inman also said stiffer penalties could be imposed on officials 
who falsify financial disclosure reports 
noting that john walkers wife barbara concealed his spying 
for 16 years before turning him in inman asked do you set up an 
awards system we do with whistle blowers 
the espionage review was planned before state department 
official felix bloch came under suspicion last year but as one 
intelligence community source said like everything else its 
been driven by some frontburner events including the bloch 
affair in which investigators have almost given up hope of filing 
criminal charges 
inman said one of the biggest difficulties in espionage cases is 
proving intent to harm the united states he suggested spies might 
be charged with crimes other than espionage such as theft of 
government property meeting a foreign agent without reporting it 
as bloch allegedly did also could be made a crime he said 
but one executive branch source dubious about the outside 
advisers usefulness said courts accept the delivery of even one 
piece of classified information to a foreign power as proof of 
intent to harm because the government warns employees who see 
secrets about the danger of exposing them 
theyre focusing on several problems that have been solved 
since they left the government this source said our big 
counterintelligence problem is not new legislation but new values 
in society so people wont be so willing to sell out their 
country 
but an intelligence community source said the need to identify a 
specific secret passed the missing element in the bloch 
investigation means you literally have to catch them 
redhanded 
this problem doesnt come up very often the intelligence 
official said when it does it presents a big hurdle

high tides over the weekend filled the 
venetian canals lifelines of this lagoon city which had sunk to 
dangerously low levels last week 
the rising waters also helped the arrival of guests for sundays 
launching of the moro di venezia the yacht belonging to italian 
tycoon raul gardini which will be italys challenger in the 1992 
americas cup 
traffic is back to normal through all canals but the problem 
of accumulated mud is something which must be solved soon said 
an official of the city waterworks who spoke on condition of 
anonymity 
traffic on scores of small canals had come to a halt last week 
due to accumulated mud and prolonged low tides 
the grand canal and other major waterways remained open to 
gondolas and motorboats 
certainly last weeks low tide was very unusual in this period 
of the year and was probably due to a long dry spell said 
antonio manfrin a venetian motorboat driver 
water was about 60 centimeters 24 inches below the normal 
levels its ironic in a city where we always had problems from 
flood tides he added 
the canals have not been dredged in 40 years the mud and low 
tides combined to cause a number of problems including the 
transportation of sick people to hospitals 
city officials claimed on saturday that cleaning of canals has 
been delayed by red tape and by the inability of regional 
authorities to find a place to store the mud

brad waller teaches shakespearean sword 
fighters how to take the ouch out of touche 
a certified expert in stage combat waller can turn an amateur 
swashbuckler into a douglas fairbanks or errol flynn in 15 weeks of 
strenuous monday night sessions at washingtons folger shakespeare 
theater 
for a 350 fee waller trains actors in the art of dueling with 
such deadly weapons as rapier and dagger broadsword and 
quarterstaff without committing mayhem on the stage but 
convincing theatergoers theyre seeing the real thing 
his rapiers slashing attacks stop perilously close to a 
students arms legs or abdomen before each parry and thrust he 
gives broad visual clues to make his next move as obvious as 
possible his bucklers the shield between a swords blade and 
handle are fashioned from hubcaps and silverplated candy dishes 
wallers deft movements are patterned after the highly refined 
techniques of camillo agrippa achille marozzo and other 16th 
century fencing masters whose books he has studied in the archives 
of the folger shakespeare library 
those techniques can be very dangerous waller said in a 
way they were meant to kill so stage combat can never be 
historically accurate or youd kill the actors i try to teach 
safety first and the skills to make the actor really look good 
the ebullient redhaired waller 34 a wisconsinborn actor who 
grew up in minneapolis learned his craft under paddy crean dean 
of the society of american fight directors it was crean who taught 
errol flynn how to handle his rapier with wit 
paddy always said that stage combat is 75 percent drama 15 
percent historical accuracy and 100 percent safety said waller 
one of only five students to receive the societys demanding 
teaching certificate in 1988 
boxoffice stars who have been coached by society professionals 
in fight choreography which includes fisticuffs as well as 
swordplay include christopher walken william hurt jon voigt 
henry winkler kathleen turner and amy irving 
when hes not working with actors teaching in local schools or 
performing onstage waller hits the road with shakespeare 
lunatics and lovers an elizabethan theatrical troupe that stages 
battles and love scenes from the bard of avons plays before high 
school audiences 
people no longer settle feuds in a fencing duel but waller says 
there will be a big demand for classical actors trained in 
swordplay as long as shakespeares plays are performed 
shakespeares works are full of bloody sword fights and 
suicides in keeping with the elizabethan tradition of pleasing 
audiences not only with plays but competitive bouts of swordplay 
waller said some of shakespeares stage roles including clowns 
and fools were written for fencing masters of the day 
in romeo and juliet the hotheaded tybalt who tilts with 
piercing steel at bold mercutios breast took his name from 
girard thibault who wrote a manual in 1628 describing the quick 
precise cutting motions of the spanish style of fencing 
before he was slain at tybalts hand mercutio called his 
adversary the very butcher of a silk button waller said that 
referred to an italian fencing master in london probably known to 
shakespeare who could take the silk buttons off any englishman 
with his rapier 
the english language in fact is rich with words and phrases 
that originated in fencing waller said 
when you say you crossed someone or gave him the slip you are 
using old fencing terms for maneuvers designed to thwart an 
opponent he said if you say come to the point you are 
really challenging someone to a duel

the tompkins square park band shell is filled 
each night with piles of ragged blankets a passerby might hear 
sneezes and snores and realize there are people underneath but 
certainly wouldnt know how many or their sex race or age 
that is what census workers are being asked to find out 
without waking anyone up from 2 am to 4 am march 21 at parks 
and other outdoor sites where the homeless congregate 
the survey is part of an unprecedented nationwide count in 
shelters parks subways vacant buildings doorways and 
bankmachine vestibules the plans critics call it poorly designed 
and doomed to undercount the homeless estimated by the coalition 
for the homeless to number 70000 to 90000 in new york city alone 
the census bureau already has issued a disclaimer 
we are deliberately staying away from defining this as a 
census of the homeless said kenneth meyer assistant regional 
census manager nor are we saying that we expect to get 100 
percent count of the homeless its going to give us some idea of 
the characteristics of this group but not necessarily the true size 
of it 
still advocates for the homeless and city officials fear a low 
count will be used to justify social service budget cuts 
some homeless advocates have refused to cooperate with the 
census bureau plan others believe they must participate to 
legitimize any objections afterward 
hopefully this exercise fraught with problems before it 
starts is not going to be used to justify yet another estimate 
from the government that is tragically low on how many homeless 
there are in the nation said peter smith president of the 
partnership for the homeless if it is we will just have to say 
we told you so 
city officials and advocates for the homeless have a long list 
of complaints about the counts timing organization the data to 
be collected and the recruitment of people to do the counting 
from 6 pm to about midnight march 20 census workers will 
visit shelters and hotels used by the homeless 
the 2 amto4 am outdoor count will be followed by a 4 
amto630 am count of those leaving abandoned buildings for 
safetys sake enumerators will not be sent inside critics want 
the counters to stay later 
homeless people like everyone else sleep at night said 
kristin morse assistant director at the coalition for the homeless 
in shelters enumerators will help homeless people fill out the 
same forms everyone else gets in the mail but enumerators counting 
homeless people in places like streets and parks need only record 
age sex race marital status and whether the person is of 
hispanic origin if the homeless person is sleeping the counter 
must guess 
in places like tompkins square on manhattans lower east side 
where the homeless wrap themselves in piles of blankets this will 
be hard yet said meyer we dont want them pulling a blanket 
off someone and find they are staring at a knife or pistol 
enumerators are forbidden to ask people whether they are 
homeless and may miss people as a result 
part of surviving on the street is being able to hide or being 
able to look like theyre not homeless said morse 
even if asked many homeless people would not admit they have no 
place to live meyer said 
in new york city officials homeless advocates transit police 
and others compiled a list of 2167 sites where homeless people 
congregate but for safety reasons some of those places such as 
train tunnels will not be surveyed 
i understand why theyre not doing it said morse the 
tunnels can be very dangerous but they are going to miss a lot of 
people 
estimates of the number of homeless nationwide have ranged from 
250000 to 3 million in recent years a decade ago census takers 
went to shelters but did not try to count people living in alleys 
under bridges and in similar locations 
the census bureau is trying to include the homeless and people 
who work with them as counters the 7 to 10anhour jobs have 
been advertised in new york city in street news a nonprofit 
newspaper sold by the homeless eliciting hundreds of inquiries 
from homeless people 
critics say the application process poses many hurdles 
applicants must fill out a fourpage form produce two pieces of 
identification provide a social security number an address and 
phone number and are asked to have five years of job experience 
and no criminal record 
meyer says the census bureau can overlook convictions for 
trespassing or other nonviolent offenses will help the homeless 
obtain social security numbers and is flexible about an uneven 
work history 
the census bureau also is funding an assessment of the survey in 
five cities by independent researchers the assessment will be used 
to refine any future count of elusive populations said kim 
hopper the primary researcher in new york

a court has indicted two agents of israels 
shin bet security service in the beating death of a palestinian 
prisoner in a jail in the occupied gaza strip the justice ministry 
announced 
the names of the two defendants and details of the case were 
banned from publication until an initial closeddoor hearing is 
held sundays announcement said it said the defendants lawyers 
had agreed to what could be published about the case 
it is unusual for charges to be brought against shin bet agents 
and the closeddoor treatment of the case was in keeping with 
traditional secrecy about the agency responsible for israels 
internal security 
the name of the agencys chief for example is an official 
secret 
the charge of manslaughter was brought in the death of khaled 
kamel al sheikh ali 27 who died dec 19 after being arrested on 
suspicion of belonging to the moslem fundamentalist jihad islami 
organization and of illegal possession of weapons 
after his death israeli newspapers quoted authorities as 
attributing his death to a heart attack but an independent autopsy 
performed at the request of his family on dec 24 found he died of 
internal bleeding 
the justice ministry announcement said the two defendants 
questioned the prisoner and during the interrogationthe 
accused dealt blows to sheikh ali and as a result sheikh ali 
suffered internal bleeding that led to his death 
the indictment was handed down thursday in jerusalem district 
court but not made public until the ministrys announcement 
the state prosecutors office had requested that details be 
withheld and the hearing be secret the announcement said 
according to an israeli human rights group there are nine other 
cases in which palestinians died in custody since the palestinian 
uprising against israeli occupation began in december 1987 those 
cases involve either prison or shin bet personnel 
the israeli center for human rights in the occupied territories 
did not list prosecutions in any of the cases 
also during the uprising four israeli soldiers were tried in 
the beating death of a palestinian in the gaza strip in august 
1988 they were acquitted of manslaughter but convicted of 
brutality 
in september a shin bet agent was acquitted of negligence in 
the death of a palestinian who died in custody in july 1987 before 
the uprising started the agents name was not made public 
the most publicized case in the past involving shin bet agents 
was the beating deaths of two palestinian guerrillas while in 
custody after the guerrillas took hostages aboard a hijacked 
israeli bus in april 1984 
the shin bet chief avraham shalom resigned amid accusations that 
evidence had been faked to frame an army officer 
president chaim herzog pardoned four top shin bet officials 
accused of either ordering the killings or withholding information 
on them israels supreme court upheld the pardons and rejected an 
appeal for a full investigation

get ready america your no tax increase 
federal government is about to start collecting another new tax 
as taxes go this one isnt much most of the impact will be on 
businesses at least at first it could raise the price of a 
telephone by a dime but add 25 or so to the cost of recharging an 
automobile air conditioner 
on april 1 the government will begin collecting this new tax 
which is aimed at limiting use of chemicals chlorofluorocarbons 
or cfcs that are deemed to damage the ozone layer protecting the 
earth 
it has the dual task of raising about 43 billion for deficit 
reduction over the next five years 
the cfc tax is only the latest move by congress and the reagan 
and bush administrations to reduce the budget deficit without 
raising incometax rates president reagan signed 13 tax increases 
during his eight years in office president bush signed a package 
of miscellaneous increases in december and proposed another round 
this year 
there is considerable feeling that the government will 
continue to look this way in the future as long as such sources can 
produce revenue says thomas p ochsenschlager of the grant 
thornton accounting firm in washington 
if bush gets his way this year for example the 8 percent 
federal tax on airline tickets will rise to 10 percent the 3 
percent levy on telephone service scheduled to expire dec 31 
will be made permanent and about 38 million state and local 
government workers who are not covered by a retirement plan will 
have to start paying social security taxes 
in the same message that proposed those tax increases bush 
proclaimed his continued opposition to tax increases just as 
reagan did for eight years and just as many members of congress do 
even after voting for those higher taxes 
the trick is that nobody is raising incometax rates excise 
taxes have been raised incometax deductions have been reduced and 
repealed but the president and congress have held fast against any 
increase in incometax rates 
that leaves the government in constant pursuit of cats and 
dogs as detractors call the miscellaneous tax increases to find 
the revenue needed for deficit reduction 
it all started in 1982 when congress had second thoughts about 
the huge 1981 tax cut that was the framework for reagans economic 
policy and voted to boost taxes by 296 billion over five years 
nobodys rates were raised but the deduction for medical 
expenses was diluted severely the tax on cigarettes was doubled 
the telephone tax was tripled and tax withholding was imposed on 
interest and dividends because of public outcry withholding was 
repealed a year later 
in 1984 congress passed another thick tax law designed to 
reduce the deficit by another 156 billion over five years it 
boosted the tax on a gallon of liquor by 2 reduced the benefit of 
income averaging for those whose earnings fluctuate from year to 
year killed a tax credit for homeowners who buy solar energy 
equipment and cut the value of several corporate tax deductions 
additional tax increases for deficit reduction were enacted in 
1985 156 billion over five years 1986 53 billion and 1988 
66 billion 
the 1989 version will bring in 22 billion over five years with 
onequarter of the money coming from a social security tax increase 
on workers earning more than 50400 a year 
the cfc tax is more typical of recent increases because it is a 
hidden levy with little direct effect on voters but consumers 
usually end up paying at least some of the taxes that are levied on 
business 
jack terher jr a ford dealer in denver said that to avoid the 
cfc tax he is spending up to 7000 on equipment to recover freon 
a cfc used as a refrigerant from auto air conditioners being 
repaired that probably will force an increase of about 25 in the 
bill for recharging an air conditioner terher said 
other cfcs are widely used by electronics manufacturers to clean 
computer chips and circuit boards because of competition however 
sellers of refrigerators computers videocassette recorders and 
televisions are unlikely to raise their prices the few cents 
necessary to recoup the tax 
i dont expect much impact on the consumer says steve 
mixtacki vice president of american tv and appliance in madison 
wis but it is another big paperwork burden for business 
although the government apparently doesnt blink at that

in the opinion of gallup poll executives 
the grandfather of public surveys has changed to keep up with the 
times 
many top executives are gone interviewing operations have moved 
from princeton headquarters to lincoln neb staffs have been 
assembled in moscow and budapest and the new owners have plans to 
make the nowweekly poll daily 
but some former employees have a different view they say that 
what the company describes as an overdue overhaul is a sacrifice of 
quality for profits 
since its purchase 18 months ago by nebraskabased selection 
research inc the gallup organization has begun moving away from 
public opinion polls to concentrate on more lucrative market 
research former executive neil upmeyer said 
i believe it is their view that because market research is 
more profitable more efficient if they deemphasize social 
reseach and give additional attention to market research they would 
have a better bottom line he said 
upmeyer a vice president of public affairs research before his 
departure now works for the center for analysis of public issues 
in princeton 
he said the new gallup owners are trying to use the polls good 
name to open more doors for private research on less engaging 
topics like toothpaste preferences 
pursuit of bigger profits he said is a perfectly legitimate 
thing for them to do but from my point of view it negates the 
purpose for having built this institution for the last 50 years it 
has the potential for irreparably damaging the gallup name 
also departing with unflattering words for the new owners were 
andrew kohut president of the gallup organization before the sri 
acquisition and diane colasanto former vice president for opinion 
research 
jim clifton a former sri executive who became chief executive 
officer of the gallup organization after the acquisition dismissed 
it all as bitterness talking 
he said upmeyer had his position upgraded a euphemism for 
being fired the old gallup organization he added was badly in 
need of a management overhaul to ensure the profitability necessary 
to continue the costly stockintrade public opinion surveys 
like the housecleaning in executive positions he said the move 
of the telephone interviewing staff to nebraska was aimed at 
getting better people on board a regional labor shortage he said 
doomed the princetonbased interviewing headquarters to a poorly 
qualified staff with rapid turnover 
the nowweekly public opinion polls will soon go daily clifton 
said the quick assembly of polling teams in moscow last year and 
budapest in january he added are hardly signs of a diminished 
commitment 
also in the works is a 60nation poll on attitudes about the 
environment which clifton bills as the largest public opinion 
survey ever done 
absolutely more time and quality are going into it a 
corporation that has been there 50 years needs change were 
upgrading technology were upgrading management clifton said 
the gallup poll is a national treasure but the reality 
is to have an outstanding public service company in the public 
opinion business you have to make a lot of profit somewhere else 
upgrading people doesnt really constitute change to me 
theres an enormous dr george gallup spirit about the place 
clifton gets a second from george gallup jr the son of the man 
who founded the polling organization in 1936 the younger gallup a 
cochairman of the company said his father would have approved of 
the new owners moves the senior gallup died in 1984 
whatever grand scheme might be behind them the changes so far 
have not hurt the quality of the gallup poll said michael kagay 
surveys editor of the new york times the times is one of about 100 
newspapers that subscribe to the polls via the los angeles times 
news syndicate 
gallup with a rich library of public opinions accumulated in a 
halfcentury in the business has a unique ability to measure 
longterm trends and provide contexts for current findings kagay 
said 
it would be a great loss if anything happened to gallup that 
would hurt its ability to provide those he said i certainly 
hope it doesnt happen 
upmeyer on the other hand thinks the abundance of polls now 
done by news organizations and other groups diminishes any void a 
gallup withdrawal would leave the harm he says is to the gallup 
name 
the work is going to continue to be done he said its 
just that it wont be done by gallup

when she introduced agriculture secretary 
clayton yeutter at a conference last week analyst susan sechler 
said a lot of the current farm bill debate is being generated by 
special interests who want to keep the pie sliced pretty much as it 
is 
within the farm policy fraternity it seems the prevailing 
mood is defensive sechler said in the aftermath of the farm 
financial disaster of the mid1980s and in the midst of a 
fragile uneven recovery the farm policy club is preoccupied with 
three things 
she said these are 
a desire to keep government deeply involved in agriculture 
including large annual costs of operating commodity programs 
tinkering with programs in the name of flexibility so that 
a few million acres can shift from one crop to another 
efforts to deny a seat at the farm poker table to prospective 
new players notably consumer and environmental interests 
sechler is director of rural economic policy for the aspen 
institute a private research organization based here during the 
carter administration she was a senior policy analyst at the 
agriculture department 
congress has been holding hearings on a 1990 farm bill to 
replace the food security act of 1985 just about everyone 
including the bush administration says the current law should be 
the basis of the 1990 bill and that changes should be made with 
tender loving care 
a mainstay of the administrations proposals is flexibility to 
allow farmers more freedom to plant what they choose rather than 
be forced into planting the same program crop year after year 
to protect their federal benefits 
this term flexibility is consistent with the rich tradition 
of agricultural policy doublespeak a tradition which in 1985 
spawned a marketoriented farm bill that since has cost taxpayers 
90 billion sechler said 
yeutter told his audience at the food policy conference 
sponsored by public voice for food and health policy that 
consumers need to understand what is at stake in the flexibility 
issue on capitol hill 
you ought to care because its going to have an impact on the 
cost of food the efficiency with which we run our food production 
system in the united states he said 
flexibility in crop plantings and rotation also would have some 
effect on the level of agricultural inputs such as fertilizer 
and pesticide used to grow food yeutter said rigid rules built 
into current programs often demand that farmers use chemicals 
to get maximum production 
yeutter also defended the administrations environmental 
proposals for conservation surface and ground water quality and 
the protection of wetlands 
some environmentalists say the administration should go even 
further than what it has proposed for the 1990 farm bill but the 
fact is weve gone a lot farther than anybodys ever gone before in 
any administration he said

land under irrigation may increase to record 
levels in the 1990s if the government continues to throttle back on 
acreage reduction programs according to an agriculture department 
analysis 
the departments economic research service said its study shows 
a linkage between acreage reduction program arp levels and the 
area under irrigation 
from 1949 to 1978 the area irrigated in the united states 
doubled reaching 503 million acres but the agricultural census 
of 1982 showed a decline of 13 million acres and the 1987 census 
showed a further drop of 26 million 
agency researchers said irrigation area dropped as the arps were 
increased this represents land farmers must take from production 
in order to qualify for price support benefits 
since 1987 a substantial reduction in commodity stocks has 
allowed usda to ease arp requirements the agency said in the 
march issue of agricultural outlook magazine in 1989 area 
diverted under annual programs was about half of the 1987 acreage 
reductions 
preliminary estimates indicate that more farmland was irrigated 
in 1989 than in any year since 1981 
beyond 1990 irrigation could rise 34 million acres above 
current levels if the area idled under the annual programs is 
brought back into production the report said

the arab league has decided to move its 
headquarters back to cairo from the tunisian capital where it was 
transferred in 1979 after egypt broke ranks with arab countries by 
making peace with israel 
in a dispatch from tunis egypts staterun middle east news 
agency said foreign minister esmat abdelmeguid of egypt announced 
the decision sunday at a regular biannual session of the 22member 
league 
he said the move would come in september 
this decision is based on the arab league charter and egypt 
has been cautious to coordinate views with tunisia because of the 
strong ties between the tunisian and egyptian leaderships 
abdelmeguid said 
he thanked kuwait oman iraq and morocco as well as arab 
league secretary general chedli klibi for their effort and 
cooperation in bringing about the decision 
the agency said the offices of the arab organization for 
education culture and science and the arab broadcasting union 
would remain in tunis 
sundays move followed egyptian diplomatic efforts to return the 
headquarters of the arab league to cairo where it was set up in 
1945 
the league decided 11 years ago to transfer the headquarters to 
tunis as a sanction against egypt for signing a peace treaty with 
israel in 1979 
all arab states except oman sudan and somalia severed ties with 
cairo in retaliation for its peace treaty with israel 
egypt returned to the arab fold after a league summit in 1987 
allowed its members to resume ties with cairo all but libya have 
officially restored diplomatic links with cairo whose suspension 
from the arab league was lifted in may at a summit meeting in 
casablanca morocco 
egypt insisted on returning the leagues offices to cairo in 
accordance with the league charter which stipulates that the 
egyptian capital should be the seat of the organization

as april 15 approaches irwin schiff 
cringes at the thought of millions of obedient americans sweating 
over their 1040s so they can turn over their hardearned dollars to 
uncle sam 
its a sad commentary on the intelligence and the awareness of 
the american public schiff said in a telephone interview from 
the morgantown wva federal prison where he is serving a second 
term for tax offenses 
the government changed april fools day from april 1 to april 
15 they fooled the public into believing that they are required 
to pay income taxes 
nobody can say schiff author of the 1982 best seller how 
anyone can stop paying income taxes doesnt have the courage of 
his convictions 
schiff landed back in prison in august when the irs found out 
that a year after his parole for a 1985 conviction he still hadnt 
paid back taxes and penalties for 1980 1981 and 1982 
over the years the tax protester has sacrificed nearly 
everything he owns in his crusade against the internal revenue 
service including an estimated 133000 in book royalties seized 
to pay back taxes hes lost his insurance and investment 
businesses 
all this because the 62yearold former hamden resident 
stubbornly refuses to yield an inch in his position that personal 
income taxes are strictly voluntary and the government cant force 
anybody to pay 
for nearly two decades schiff has been preaching to anybody 
wholl listen to his interpretation of the 16th amendment which 
gave the us government authority to tax income from any source 
or so the irs says 
schiff maintains that the amendment adopted in 1913 gave the 
government power to tax goods and privileges but not wages the 
amendment by the way was never ratified by connecticut 
he stopped paying income taxes at least voluntarily in 1974 
the irs finally got schiff in 1980 he was sentenced to six 
months in prison and fined 10000 he was arrested again in 1985 
serving six months before being paroled 
since landing back in prison schiff who is representing 
himself in this legal morass has come up with yet another scheme 
to frustrate the irs go ahead and fill out the irs forms but 
dont declare any taxable income zero 
schiffs family wishes he would relent in his battle against the 
irs but they doubt he will 
a lot of people think he is an idiot but he is not said his 
son andrew who unlike his father pays his taxes like many 
people who are obsessed with a cause he is only very stubborn

the parents and doctor of a 13yearold girl 
who died of vaginal cancer say they suspect other children could be 
at risk of cancer caused by a drug their grandmothers took decades 
earlier 
sarah roberts of suburban olney md whose daughter amy died 
last year said a lawyer representing the family was filing suit 
today against eli lilly and co of indianapolis which manufactured 
the synthetic hormone diethylstilbestrol or des 
a lilly spokesman did not return a telephone call seeking 
comment 
the food and drug administration banned the drug from use by 
pregnant women in the early 1970s after it had been used by an 
estimated 3 million women over three decades in the belief that it 
would prevent miscarriages 
des was made and sold by some 300 pharmaceutical companies from 
1947 to 1971 in 1970 researchers discovered the link between des 
and cancer in daughters of women who used the drug 
don mclearn an fda spokesman said amy roberts case was the 
first he had heard of a genetic defect that may be related to des 
possibly being passed to a grandchild in amys case the gene 
would have come through her father 
mrs roberts said her motherinlaw who is still living and has 
one other young granddaughter took the drug in 1949 when she was 
pregnant with amys father the rev j david roberts a methodist 
minister in olney 
she said two of her husbands sisters have had medical problems 
which they blame on the drug their mother took two grandchildren 
died after being born prematurely she said 
the fda says the drug is still manufactured for some medical 
applications but is banned from use during pregnancy 
amy had no symptoms until she came home from school on a 
thursday complaining of a pain in the back of her neck mrs 
roberts said in a telephone interview a week later she said 
doctors had discovered cancer in amys vagina and lungs and told 
the roberts their daughter had only three months to live 
amy died last june after doctors fought for 14 months to 
control the rare cancer which spread through her body mrs 
roberts said 
we are hoping to alert other des sons and daughters that there 
is a possibility of cancer and that maybe their daughters should be 
checked said mrs roberts she said doctors told her amy might 
have lived after surgery if the cancer had been detected earlier 
a first sign of a problem may have come when amy began 
menstruating at age 9 mrs roberts said but a pediatrician told 
her nothing was wrong 
dr herbert kotz of olney who talked about the case only after 
it was reported by the washington post on sunday said he and three 
other doctors were preparing an article on it for submission to a 
medical journal 
kotz said the article will explore the possibility that the 
effects of des may be passed beyond one generation 
it also will note he said that the same cancer has been found 
in several young women who had no exposure to des in their family 
histories and amys case could have occurred by chance 
kotz said the cancer usually is found among older women and has 
almost never been linked to des in a woman who showed the first 
symptoms after age 30 
a coauthor of the planned paper dr bruce walker has predicted 
from animal studies that des effects can pass through more than one 
generation kotz said 
he said the purpose of the paper is to alert the medical 
profession to the fact that we may have another generation at 
risk from the drug 
the us supreme court in october refused to hear appeals from 
lilly er squibb amp sons and rexall drug co fighting lawsuits 
over the effects of des a new york ruling had forced all 
manufacturers of the drug to share in paying damages for alleged 
des injuries 
in march 1987 a us district court jury in milwaukee ruled 
lilly was not negligent in marketing des for use by pregnant women 
the court rejected a claim by julie shirkey 25 of west bend 
wis who said her mothers use of des had left her with vaginal 
cancer which led to a radical hysterectomy and the inability to 
bear children

yen monday sending prices on the tokyo stock exchange down 
sharply dealers said

strong showing in new york friday following the announcement of a 
betterthanexpected us employment figure for february said toru 
kanai a foreign exchange analyst with new japan securities co 
traders said the bank of japan the central bank sold dollars 
at around 15185 yen in morning trading in its effort to stem the 
yens fall japans central bank normally does not comment on its 
interventionary activities 
the employment statistics showed that the united states had 
found jobs for 372000 more nonagricultural workers in february 
compared with about 250000 expected prior to the release 
although demand for the dollar remains strong the currency is 
not soaring quickly because many participants are becoming 
concerned about the excessive rise in the dollar kanai said 
on the stock market securities dealers said the yens 
continuing weakness and persistent speculation about a possible 
discount rate hike caused the indexs fall 
the whole market is weak across the board today mainly because 
people do not want to engage in trading said a dealer at nikko 
securities co speaking on condition of anonymity 
market players have been speculating the bank of japan would 
raise its official lending rate which now stands at 425 percent 
by as much as 1 percent after central bank governor yasushi mieno 
returns thursday from a visit to europe 
the markets anxiety over the rate increase sidelined investors 
the dealer said 
id rather see the market get over an interest rate hike soon 
and get back in action again he said

les aspin the chairman of the house armed 
services committee says his plan for next years pentagon budget 
is in the back of his beadyeyed mind and hes not talking 
the wisconsin democrat says he plans to hide in the weeds 
while others are wrestling with the issue of us defense spending 
in a world where the perceived threats to the nation are changing 
with breathtaking speed 
sen sam nunn dga the senate armed services committee 
chairman is also keeping quiet needs more information he says 
aspin and nunn as much as probably anyone in the united states 
understand the changing political landscape in eastern europe and 
elsewhere what they need more time to survey the effect those 
changes have had on the american public and on the playing field of 
capitol hill 
the 1980s were a decade in which defense spending accelerated 
rapidly and then leveled off near 300 billion a year the yearly 
budget battle took on a comfortable script the republican 
administration would propose a big increase the democrats would 
pare it down and a compromise would be struck 
that pattern has now been shattered by the developments in the 
soviet sphere 
its a confusing situation it changes the way the game is 
played said rep leon panetta dcalif chairman of the house 
budget committee 
the white house proposed a small increase in pentagon spending 
for fiscal 1991 less than what it would take to keep pace with 
inflation but enough to protect cherished programs such as the b2 
stealth bomber and the strategic defense initiative its a 
comfortable position for congressional republicans of whom defense 
secretary dick cheney was one until last year 
but democratic policymakers are facing demands in their party 
for a peace dividend of pentagon cutbacks to spend on domestic 
priorities they now have to decide how deeply to cut from cheneys 
303 billion request and where the cuts will be made 
panetta says the toughest decisions will be on terminating 
weapons programs especially those such as the b2 bomber where 
significant investments have been made and where budget savings are 
slow to be realized 
what youre talking about is reversing the process which took 
place in the last eight years where the military could launch 
into expensive multiyear projects and assume the budget would 
grow to pay for them he said 
reducing troop strength may also yield savings in the long term 
rather than soon because of the cost of bring the soldiers home 
and close the bases 
senate budget committee chairman james sasser dtenn has 
loosely embraced a plan to trim spending to 291 billion 5 
billion below the current years level the cuts over the next five 
years however would total more than 10 times that amount 
democratic leaders say their struggle is for a defense spending 
figure that represents a sound policy but since sound policy is in 
the eye of the beholder electionyear politics will undoubtedly be 
a big part of the bill that passes 
the worst thing that can happen is to simply pull a number out 
of the air which no one can vote for said panetta 
liberal or conservative lawmakers are touchy about any cuts 
that might reverberate back home especially in an election year 
and since the majority democrats have brought to their districts 
more bacon republicans are trying to make it an issue 
whether its an air base or a naval base or the manpower 
around it or the defense industry or the subcontractors 
members of congress are hooked on military spending in their 
districts said house republican leader robert michel of illinois 
because of that the democrats have got serious problems in 
drafting a defense bill he said 
theyll have to show they understand that the underlying 
reason for having a department of defense and security forces are 
to protect the security of the country and not be a jobs program or 
a welfare program michel said 
defense contractors sensitive to homedistrict politics have 
played the system carefully projects like the b2 have 
subcontractors spread all over the country 
were going to have to find a number that meets a lot of 
political questions said rep marvin leath of texas a 
conservative democrat on the armed services committee 
it aint going to be an easy chore he said 
and its not going to be quick house democratic leaders are 
still fighting with the pentagon over its proposed changes in the 
current years budget 
it might take less time to unify germany than to get congress 
and the administration to agree on a defense bill this year

the case in federal bankruptcy court was strictly 
small potatoes but it meant a lot to mechanic norman darish he 
won it all himself 
after months of stolen hours at the library lunch breaks spent 
cramming on legaleseand latenight rehearsals in front of a 
mirror darish represented himself in a case concerning several 
hundred dollars in unpaid bills at his familys garage 
and he won 
even the attorneys were impressed 
check this out one lawyer told another after the case was 
closed this kid represented himself and he did all right he did 
real good 
darish made his 10minute argument with all the panache of perry 
mason his suit however was not pinstripes but workboots and a 
navy blue uniform with leos auto repair embroidered over the 
breast pocket 
darish hadnt even removed the phillips screwdriver air 
pressure gauge and magnetic pickup tool from his hip pocket before 
hopping on the subway to make his lunchtime appearance 
i didnt want to be pompous or a showboat he recalled 
still flying high a week after winning his case early this month 
i just wanted to look like myself an average person 
the defendant a boston socialite claimed protection from 
creditors under a federal bankruptcy filing but darish found out 
he had been under federal bankruptcy protection almost perpetually 
between 1982 and 1990 
and meanwhile the little guys he owed money to were stuck 
said darsish who appealed to the federal bankruptcy judge the 
judge agreed to dismiss the chapter 13 filing

when actors at the guthrie theater share the 
tools of their trade with lawyers they start off with a 
paradoxical lesson 
the idea is not to get them to act said actress brenda 
wehle the idea to get them to stop acting and be themselves 
since communication is a large part of the trial lawyers job 
the trial lawyers attending the class taught by wehle and actor 
richard guthrie are urged to strip away the extraneous gestures 
that make the jury focus on them 
the communication can never be how clever the attorney is 
said wehle the communication has to be the predicament the 
client was in 
the lessons are sometimes drawn through skits 
in one grusin plays a lawyer who is making a brilliant closing 
argument when opposing counsel wehle begins rattling papers 
behind him in the parlance of the theater he is being upstaged 
grusin does the only thing he can do to bring the jurys focus 
back on him he walks back to wehles table and stands alongside 
her 
shell start seeing that ive caught her and everybody else 
sees it too he said so what started out being a cute little 
ploy becomes a weapon for me 
grusin has taught communications skills to thousands of lawyers 
at the request of law schools bar associations and law firms he 
also has been hired by lawyers to sit in on trials and critique 
their performance 
not all reviews have been favorable the late leon jaworski the 
famed watergate special prosecutor wrote a scathing critique after 
attending one of grusins sessions he felt the law was being 
obscured by technique 
but grusin after some thought concluded that he was not 
obscuring the law but clarifying it 
trying to be someone else is a lie that blocks effective 
communication he said

harvard has the nations top medical school 
stanford offers the finest business training yale has the premium 
law school and massachusetts institute of technology is the best 
place for a graduate degree in engineering says a survey released 
today 
a schools reputation among educators and in the outside world 
was a major subjective factor said us news amp world report in 
releasing the results of a survey evaluating us graduate 
education in its march 19 issue the magazine emphasized that the 
institutions receiving top ranking in the survey do not exercise 
a monopoly on quality education 
nevertheless institutional reputations matter in some 
professions they may be crucial the magazine said fairly or 
unfairly the value of a degree from that institution depends in 
part upon those perceptions 
four professional programs were surveyed business 
engineering law and medicine harvard and stanford placed in the 
top five in three of those categories more than any other 
institutions 
harvard in addition to being tops in medicine ranked second in 
business and fifth in law stanford ranked second in engineering 
and third among law schools in addition to its top rating for 
business 
the magazine developed its rankings after interviewing faculty 
members and deans across the country since last fall the survey 
used objective standards quality of students accepted value of 
the degree in the job market and research spending along with 
subjective measures such as a schools reputation 
the subjective survey was done by the washington office of 
market facts inc the magazine says it polled thousands of 
academic and professional authorities to determine how the experts 
on and off campus perceive a given institution 
although the rankings were dominated by institutions with 
established reputations the survey also identified the dark 
horse institutions in each field by giving them a 
bestupandcoming designation 
those were washington university in st louis for business 
george mason university in fairfax va for law university of 
alabama at birmingham for medicine and university of california at 
santa barbara for engineering

its first graduatelevel evaluation

a tokyo train line introduced seatless cars today 
to reduce overcrowding during rush hours and got a mixed response 
from commuters some of whom complained of being treated like 
packages 
the new cars on the crowded yamanote loop line have foldable 
seats that can be lowered or folded back into the wall 
automatically by pushing a button a railroad official said 
the seats will remain folded during morning rush hour to 
increase the capacity of the cars and allow easier movement of 
passengers on and off trains he said 
regular train cars on the line have a rated capacity of 144 
while the new cars can officially carry 162 people said the 
official who spoke on condition of anonymity the cars actually 
carry many more passengers during rush hour when they frequently 
are packed so tightly that people can hardly move 
only two trains with two seatless cars each were introduced 
today as an a experiment the official said 
we will see how it goes and will decide whether we will 
continue the experiment he said 
the reaction of passengers was divided a middleage commuter 
interviewed by kyodo news service said he liked the new car because 
it was less crowded and that few people are able to sit anyway in 
cars that have seats 
other passengers said they felt they were being treated like 
packages and were riding in a freight train 
the train official dismissed the criticism 
we decided to introduce the seatless cars to give better 
service and have never thought of treating our customers as 
packages he said

the roman catholic archbishop of los angeles 
acted too hastily in sending letters to elderly priests and nuns 
seeking volunteers to test an experimental aids vaccine a key 
researcher said 
even the prototype vaccines developer dr jonas salk the 
75yearold pioneer of the polio vaccine was unaware of the appeal 
by archbishop roger mahony said dr alexandra levine of the 
university of southern california 
a plan to send letters seeking volunteers from the clergy had 
been agreed upon levine said but we had no intention of 
sending the letters until after all of the necessary approvals for 
the study had been granted 
mahony in italy for a visit to the vatican confirmed he sent 
letters to 2500 priests and nuns in january 
mahony said he was contacted by dr brian henderson of the 
norris cancer institute at the university of southern california 
who was working with salk and seeking volunteers levine works with 
henderson and salk 
youre looking for people who would want to volunteer for 
something that could be very risky mahony said in an interview 
youre really looking for people who have a commitment to 
humankind and willingness to take risks to benefit others 
because the vaccine contains deactivated aids virus there is a 
possibility that people injected with it could become infected 
just as many americans were infected with polio in the early 1950s 
when salk used the same technique to develop the vaccine that 
eventually saved thousands from the crippling disease 
the infections resulted because some traces of the virus 
contained in the polio vaccine hadnt been killed 
the state department of health services is considering the 
request from researchers at usc to test 10 uninfected individuals 
who are at very low risk of aids infection levine said 
on sunday cardinal john oconnor who heads the new york 
archdiocese said he would consider trying an aids vaccine himself 
if volunteers were needed and other members of his archdiocese 
wanted him to participate 
anything that is morally licit and makes a contribution should 
be considered said oconnor 70 
henderson who was the attending physician for the late cardinal 
timothy manning could not be reached by telephone sunday 
already 100 people infected with the aids virus have been 
inoculated with salks vaccine and the food and drug 
administration has approved national tests for 1000 others levine 
said 
levine is hoping tests on healthy volunteers will stimulate 
their immune systems to produce large quantities of antibodies 
against the aids virus those antibodies in turn would be removed 
from the bloodstream purified and injected into aids patients 
whose immune systems cannot produce antibodies 
in addition tests on healthy people may lay the foundation for 
a vaccine to prevent aids levine said

stripped of recognition by the us government 
in 1897 the miami indian tribe has pinned its hopes of prosperity 
on regaining its identity 
federal recognition could translate into millions in economic 
aid and social services while helping to preserve the identity of 
the 6000member tribe based for centuries in the flat woodlands 
of northern indiana 
since 1980 the tribe has submitted 10 volumes of documentation 
including the names of each tribe member proof of the tribes 
longstanding existence includes the indiana towns named after 
chiefs muncie and kokomo 
the bureau of indian affairs has promised to try to decide on 
recognition by friday although officials said the decision could 
be delayed 
i dont see how it could go against us because the miamis are 
probably the best documented tribe east of the mississippi 
tribal chairman raymond white said last week the word out in 
indian country and washington is that if the miamis dont make it 
there wont be another tribe that will make it 
under guidelines set up in 1978 landless tribes can gain access 
to federal aid and other advantages once they gain official 
recognition 
the recognition process has proved to be a bureaucratic 
nightmare for the more than 100 tribes that have applied mostly 
small tribes from the east and west coasts seven have been 
acknowledged and 12 denied said bia spokesman carl shaw 
recognition would allow the miami nation to set tax rates for 
its businesses sell taxfree municipal bonds and become eligible 
for programs administered by the bia and the indian health service 
white who runs the tribe on behalf of its ailing 75yearold 
chief francisco shoemaker has ambitious plans for the miamis 
under his guidance the tribe in december started a joint 
venture with medimail inc a san diego calif drug distributor 
the tribe finds customers among indian clinics and hospitals around 
the country for medimail 
recognition could open the door to a federal loan to expand the 
tribes pharmacy business the tribe also has plans for a 50unit 
federally funded housing complex and a health clinic in peru 
the drug warehouse and other projects would create about 100 
jobs for the miamis about 2000 of whom are scattered among eight 
northern indiana counties white said the tribe has no land of its 
own 
the tribe is working with the indiana department of natural 
resources to build a resort on the mississinewa river near peru 
in a year to 18 months there would be 60 to 100 million in 
development started if federal recognition comes through white 
said 
for now said white who also works fulltime as a machine 
repairman at general motors in anderson the tribe is broke we 
dont even have a budget were on a shoestring he said 
mayor richard blair said recognition for the miamis would 
provide a boost to the economy of miami county the feeling is 
positive he said our heritage goes back a long way with the 
indians 
in fact the miamis heritage goes back a bit further than that 
of the town 
once based in what is now wisconsin the tribe began hunting and 
fishing the area around the mississinewa river in the 1650s in 
1816 indiana became a state and in 1846 the government forced 
much of the tribe to relocate to oklahoma 
the miamis lost their treaty rights in 1893 the oklahoma miamis 
recently won federal recognition in a separate petition

blacks protesting the ouster of selmas 
school superintendent defied a court order today and spent the 
night inside city hall and in tents on the lawn 
were waiting to notify the judge that theyre violating the 
order said mayor joe smitherman 
about half a dozen protesters were inside city hall over the 
weekend and slept there this morning and in two tents pitched in 
front 
circuit judge leslie johnson on saturday had barred protesters 
from spending the night eating and playing cards in city hall or 
disrupting city council business 
dallas county commissioner perry varner one of the protesters 
said they might begin complying with the order today but he added 
sarcastically we just got the order and it might take us two 
days to read it because theyve tracked us into lower levels you 
know 
one of the protesters complaints is tracking in which 
black students are supposedly placed in lowerlevel classes 
city hall has been in an uproar since the whitecontrolled 
school board decided dec 21 against renewing the 80000ayear

both the mayor siad 
roussell who has held the job 2 years blamed his dismissal on 
racism the school board cited differences over management

the dollar hit its highest level against the 
japanese yen in tokyo in more than 2 years today sending prices 
plunging on the tokyo stock exchange traders said 
the dollar rose above the psychologically important 152yen 
level early in the day and ended the days trading at exactly 
15200 yen despite profittaking and extensive central bank 
intervention they said 
it was the us currencys highest close in tokyo since aug 14 
1987 when it finished at 15240 yen 
the dollar began the day at 15168 yen up from last fridays 
close of 15115 yen and ranged between 15160 yen and 15218 yen 
participants predicted the dollar would move into the middle of 
the 152yen range this week but remained wary of central bank 
intervention low volume in tokyo because of the end of the 
japanese fiscal year this month rules out a sudden rise they said 
the yens decline sent stocks sharply lower in slow trading as 
selling late in the afternoon by arbitrageurs boosted losses in the 
nikkei stock average traders said 
the 225share nikkei index which rose 30223 points friday 
dropped 62489 points or 184 percent today to close at 
3336823 due in part to program selling linked to stockindex 
arbitrage in which traders profit from price differences in the 
spot and futures markets dealers said 
many participants stayed on the sidelines because of the yens 
decline against the dollar dealers said 
yoshio shimoyoma general manager of stock trading at nikko 
securities said the yens weakness didnt immediately cause large 
amounts of selling but caused a decline in buying interest which 
in turn allowed a small amount of selling and arbitrage trading to 
push the nikkei down sharply 
volume on the exchanges first section was estimated at 370 
million shares down from 664 million shares friday 
bargain hunting by individual investors encouraged by strong 
advances late last week pushed the nikkei above 34000 points 
during the first 30 minutes of trading dealers said but the 
decline of the yen quickly reversed the nikkeis direction they 
said 
the dollar was bolstered by its strong showing in new york 
friday following the announcement of betterthanexpected us 
employment figures for february said toru kanai a foreign 
exchange analyst with new japan securities co 
the employment statistics showed that the united states found 
jobs for 372000 more nonagricultural workers last month compared 
to about 250000 expected prior to the release 
traders said the bank of japan the central bank intervened 
repeatedly and sizeably in the market in an effort to stem the 
yens fall the bank normally does not comment on the amount of its 
market interventions 
the yens weakness combined with lower bond prices and the 
falling stock futures index reminded traders how bearish the 
market still is said an official at wako securities who spoke 
on condition of anonymity 
although traders enjoyed a brief bullish respite late last week 
they saw bearish market sentiment quickly reestablish itself when 
the yen continued to fall on the foreign exchange market he said 
yields on benchmark no 119 10year government bonds closed at 
7240 percent up from 7160 percent at the markets closing friday

premier li peng will travel to moscow in late 
april in the first visit by a chinese head of government to the 
soviet union in nearly 30 years soviet sources say 
lis trip scheduled to begin april 23 or 24 follows the 
dramatic visit to beijing by soviet president michael s gorbachev 
last may that ended three decades of bad blood between the two 
communist neighbors 
the exchange of visits however has come against a background 
of swiftly unfolding events that largely eliminated fears or 
expectations that a sinosoviet rapprochement would transform world 
strategic alliances 
gorbachevs visit was overshadowed by studentled prodemocracy 
demonstrations in beijing that led to a violent military crackdown 
in june and the ascendancy of a new hardline leadership 
lis trip comes at a time of radical political and economic 
changes in the soviet union that have again dislocated any 
ideological compatibility the two sides might have had 
although china has not openly criticized the soviet union 
senior leader deng xiaoping in internal speeches has reportedly 
accused gorbachev of revisionism a word used by mao tsetung 
in condemning nikita khrushchev in the 1950s 
disputes between mao and khrushchev over ideology and leadership 
of the communist world led to a final break in 1960 when the 
soviets withdrew all their technical advisers from china 
the last chinese premier to visit moscow was chou enlai who 
attended a soviet party congress in october 1961 chou avoided 
meeting khrushchev blasted his policy of detente with the west and 
scorned the soviet leader by laying a wreath on the tomb of his 
discredited predecessor stalin 
li who studied engineering at the moscow power institute from 
1948 to 1954 is said to speak russian and has long been identified 
with sovietstyle central planning and stress on heavy industry 
in december 1985 thenvice premier li made a surprise stopover 
in moscow on his way home from a european tour for a meeting with 
gorbachev to promote warming relations between the two countries 
the 61yearold premier has denied however that he is 
prosoviet and his talks in moscow are not expected to produce any 
major agreements the two sides could reach interim accords on 
ongoing talks to settle border disputes or lessen military 
confrontation on the 4300mile frontier 
increasing trade will also be on the agenda as well as such 
international issues as cambodia afghanistan east europe and arms 
reduction

estonians have appealed to the united 
nations for help in breaking away from moscow calling for 
peacekeeping forces that would monitor an end to what they called 
50 years of soviet occupation 
the proclamation sunday by the unsanctioned but popularly 
elected congress came the same day baltic neighbor lithuania 
declared independence from the soviet union and two days after the 
republic of georgia condemned the soviet annexation of its 
territory 
today the estonian congress was scheduled to discuss the 
republics borders and the status of nonestonian residents it is 
to elect a 77member council which will be charged with 
negotiating independence with officials in moscow 
the 499member congress has no formal political power but it 
considers itself the highest representative body of ethnic 
estonians living in the republic and abroad 
the congress on sunday appealed to the united nations to demand 
that the soviet union restore the independence and sovereignty of 
the republic of estonia it called for the help of international 
peacekeeping forces during a transition period 
there was no immediate comment from un officials 
the congress also said in its declaration that estonia was 
illegally annexed by the soviet union in 1940 and is to this day 
still occupied by the ussr 
the congress said it is willing to work with the estonian 
supreme soviet legislature for independence but delegates are 
expecting many communists in the supreme soviet to be swept out of 
office in elections march 18 
so far the congress has only hopes that soviet leaders will meet 
with its representatives 
it is not a question of whether we want independence or not 
its a question of what kind of independence we want said 
delegate tunne kelam who opened the congress 
kelam said gorbachevs demand of lithuania for 34 billion in 
compensation for moscows decades of investment was a political 
ploy 
its just propaganda even if estonia gets such a bill our 
bill for damages from moscow during 50 years of occupation would be 
much greater kelam said in an interview 
however in contrast to lithuania and the third baltic republic 
latvia estonia is treading a careful line estonia has a 
population of only 16 million 
we dont dare take the bull by the horns not at this point 
in time we must not provoke moscow kelam said 
the delegates to the congress included leading representatives 
of newly established political parties opposing the ruling 
communists but no highranking government officials 
on friday the georgian supreme soviet legislature denounced the 
soviet occupation and annexation of georgia and called for talks on 
restoring georgian independence 
the red army occupied georgia in 1921 and subsequent treaties 
made georgia part of the soviet union

sticking out of a garbage bag in the box and realized what the 
ball was 
he looked closer and found arms and legs police said 
area residents call the block the morgue because five 
bodies have been found there in the past two years the daily news

an epidemic of dizziness chest pain and sore 
throats among toll takers may have been at least partly 
psychosomatic officials say 
between feb 16 and 22 34 workers at the triborough bridge 
suffered such symptoms chemical fumes were suspected and health 
and environmental experts investigated many possibilities but 
learned nothing officials said 
medical experts said some of the characteristics of the plague 
were consistent with epidemic stress syndrome or the spread of a 
psychosomatic illness through a group the new york times reported 
today 
anthony m mauro president of the bridge and tunnel workers 
union said i think the first 20 or 25 actually experienced 
heavy nonbreathable fumes but he acknowledged the rest may 
have succumbed to anxiety 
bridge officials similarly concluded that the outbreak had a 
psychosomatic element but would not say so without assurances of 
anonymity the times said 
its a political hot potato to go on the record and say that 
its psychological the union will go wild an unidentified 
official told the paper 
sheila l kennedy a spokeswoman for the triborough bridge and 
tunnel authority was asked whether some of the symptoms may have 
been in the workers minds she said its very very very 
possible but we cant conclude that 
can we prove it no i dont think we want to prove it these 
people work very hard and we dont want to make little of what 
happens to them she said 
dizziness and head throat or chest pain are among the most 
common complaints in epidemic stress syndrome the times reported 
bridge officials checked the workers drinking water uniform 
launderers coins coffee grounds heating ducts and air vents 
they examined nearby factory smokestacks and the heating system of 
a sewage treatment plant 
thomas m downs tbta president said nearly 1 million was

a former aide to the presidential 
candidate assassinated by drug bosses has won the governing partys 
presidential nomination and heads into the may general election as 
the frontrunner 
cesar gaviria of the governing liberal party claimed victory in 
sundays presidential primary the first in the countrys history 
after all five of his rivals conceded defeat he is favored to win 
the general election in may 
this was luis carlos galans victory gaviria said 
referring to the popular candidate whose slaying in august touched 
off a bloody war between the government and drug barons 
speaking to reporters late sunday at a victory celebration at 
his bogota headquarters the 43yearold gaviria added that the win 
was bittersweet because galan had died before the triumph of his 
ideas 
gaviria had been galans campaign manager 
an economist by training gaviria has pledged to follow galans 
political program including his strong committment to fighting the 
power of the countrys cocaine cartels but the candidate has said 
he may try suspected drug traffickers in colombia rather than 
extradite them to the united states 
in the may 27 elections gaviria is to face 47yearold rodrigo 
lloreda chosen as the opposition conservative party candidate at a 
national convention in november president virgilio barco is barred 
by the constitution from running for reelection the presidential 
terms is four years 
with approximately 15 percent of the precints reporting in 
sundays primary gaviria had received 403611 votes or 597 
percent of the total while his nearest opponent ernesto samper 
had won 123917 or 183 percent the rcn radio network compiled the 
figures from counts by regional voting boards 
the national voting registry had not made its own compilation by 
early this morning 
elections were also held sunday for federal state and local 
offices 
rcn and another radio network caracol predicted that the 
liberal party would win 60 percent of the 313 seats in the 
countrys legislature while the conservative party the main 
opposition would win 37 percent 
the liberals previously held 178 seats or 57 percent and the 
conservatives 126 seats or 40 percent 
former leftist guerrillas from the april 19 movement or m19 
were said to have received a small but significant vote 
considering that they had laid down their arms and formed a 
political party only 48 hours before the polls opened 
m19 members were in the running in two of the 1005 mayors 
races throughout the country 
the days only fatal election violence occurred when police shot 
and killed a member of another guerrilla group in a confrontation 
in the southeastern town of puerto nidia said gen nelson mejia 
the commander of the countrys armed forces 
political violence left six dead on saturday officials said 
the liberal party recaptured the bogotas mayors office but 
the conservatives won the office in cali colombias third largest 
city and were neck and neck with liberal candidates in medellin and 
barranquilla rcn said 
colombians also voted for or against a nonbinding resolution to 
call a national assembly to reform the countrys constitution the 
proposed reforms are aimed at increasing the publics political 
participation and reducing political patronage and corruption 
extradition has been barcos main weapon in his antidrug 
crackdown which began hours after galans death the 
administration has sent 14 drug suspects to the united states for 
trial and has maintained the policy despite an offer by medellin 
cartel leaders to surrender if extradition is ended 
traffickers responded with 262 terrorist attacks mostly 
bombings that killed 209 people 
they called a unilateral truce in the drug war on jan 17 and 
have said they are willing to surrender their illicit business and 
themselves if the government scraps its extradition policy and 
promises to try them in colombia

nelson mandela arrived today for a 
reunion with fellow antiapartheid campaigner oliver tambo in the 
country that has been the major western supporter of the struggle 
against apartheid 
a jubilant crowd of swedes and africans greeted mandela and his 
wife winnie at stockholm airport standing in the remains of an 
overnight snowfall they performed the toyitoyi footstamping 
dance made popular by south african activists 
mandela was expected later today to have a quiet and private 
meeting with african national congress president tambo recovering 
in a stockholm clinic from a stroke 
the two men once law partners have not seen each other since 
mandela was jailed in south africa 27 years ago and tambo went into 
exile south african president f w de klerk freed mandela and 
legalized the anc last month in moves intended to promote 
whiteblack negotiations 
black nationalists seek a oneman onevote system that would end 
racial segregation while the government insists that group rights 
must be preserved for minorities including whites 
now deputy president of the anc and its effective leader 
mandela had planned to cut short his weeklong swedish stay and 
leave for south africa thursday 
he was reported concerned by growing unrest in black homelands 
and townships and a warning by the south african government that 
it might intervene with emergency powers to end the violence 
but an anc spokesman said today that mandela will stay in sweden 
until saturday as originally scheduled unofficial sources said 
the swedish government which is to give the anc 45 million in 
nonmilitary aid this year had urged mandela to stay on 
on his first trip outside africa since his release mandela came

the leader of irans radical faction said 
some of the foreigners kidnapped in lebanon were spies and argued 
against releasing any of what he called the mercenary us 
hostages 
the comment came in an editorial signed by ali akbar mohtashemi 
that was published saturday in tehrans persianlanguage kayhan and 
made available today in nicosia 
also today the official islamic republic news agency quoted the 
son of the late ayatollah ruhollah khomeini as accusing the united 
states of falsely trying to imply that ties with iran are improving 
mohtashemi is a former interior minister who heads the faction 
that opposes president hashemi rafsanjanis openings to the west 
in the editorial he attacked those who suggest iran should help get 
the hostages freed 
the islamic republic of iran cannot and should not impose its 
policies and views on other moslem nations he wrote 
furthermore the freedom of the hostages means breaking the 
chains of bloodthirsty wolves 
the sentence for a spy in an islamic country is death 
mohtashemi wrote 
the westerners held in lebanon are eight americans four 
britons two west germans two swiss an irishman and an italian 
the longest held is terry anderson 42 chief middle east 
correspondent for the associated press he was kidnapped march 16 
1985 
mohtashemi said a recent call for the hostages release in the 
tehran times which is aligned with rafsanjani and similar 
comments by lebanese shiite moslem spiritual leader mohammed 
hussein fadlallah heightened the pressure on the islamic 
revolution and the moslems of lebanon 
instead of putting pressure on the wronged lebanese moslems to 
release the mercenary us hostages world public opinion should 
look for the center of hostagetaking at the white house and among 
western and american intelligence services he wrote 
he claimed that some of the hostages were spies for the cia 
specifically naming terry waite the british envoy of the 
archbishop of canterbury who disappeared in west beirut in january 
1987 the church has denied this 
mohtashemi also said col william higgins was a spy for the cia 
the united states has denied that higgins captors said in july 
1989 they had executed him 
khomeinis son ahmad said washington was trying to create the 
impression that relations between iran and the united states are 
so close that when a person impersonates the iranian president and 
calls up the us president he easily talks to that person irna 
reported 
he was referring to the incident a month ago when president bush 
spoke on the phone to an impostor who claimed to be president 
hashemi rafsanjani 
his comment echoed editorials sunday in two radical tehran 
newspapers jomhuri islami and abrar they wrote that the united 
states was trying to insinuate that relations with tehran are 
improving

three democratic candidates for governor are 
fighting to keep their runoff hopes alive and the republican 
primary field is hoping just to keep oilman clayton williams from a 
landslide 
severe thunderstorms hampered campaign plans sunday for the 
candidates vying to replace retiring gov bill clements in 
tuesdays primary elections 
poll results printed in sundays dallas morning news and the 
houston chronicle dampened hopes for opponents of williams who is 
favored by 55 percent of those interviewed for the gop primary 
williams has spent about 6 million of his own money in his 
first bid for public office state railroad commissioner kent 
hance initially perceived as the frontrunner trailed with 13 
percent followed by houston businessman jack rains and dallas 
lawyer tom luce with 8 percent each 
on the democratic side state treasurer ann richards had the 
support of 28 percent of voters attorney general jim mattox had 25 
percent and former gov mark white had 24 percent 
white criticized ms richards campaign for distributing a flier 
at black churches sunday that said white had lied about supporting 
minorities 
i think that mindaltering drugs may have longer term 
effects as far as her campaign is concerned white said ten 
years may not be long enough 
ms richards has said she hasnt been under the influence of a 
mindaltering chemical in 10 years since she was treated for 
alcoholism she called whites remarks really pathetic 
mattox in southern texas criticized ms richards for what he 
termed her gutterstyle campaign 
richard murray of the public policy center at the university of 
houston which conducted the poll said the democrats appeared 
destined for a runoff there could be a lot of movement over the 
weekend he said making the runoff mates impossible to predict 
in the gop race the question is not will williams fall under 
50 but will he get over 60 murray said 
if no candidate finishes with more than half the vote the top 
two votegetters face each other in an april 10 runoff 
the policy center polled 848 people between march 4 and march 7 
the polls margin of error was plus or minus 5 percentage points 
for republicans and 45 percentage points for democrats murray 
said

vice president dan quayle shook hands and 
chatted today with outgoing nicaraguan president daniel ortega the 
leftist leader long shunned by the united states 
ortega and quayle met inside the citys municipal cathedral at a 
mass celebrating sundays inauguration of chilean president 
patricio aylwin it was not immediately known what they talked 
about the encounter was a casual one as thousands of people 
arrived for the early morning service 
the scene was in contrast to past diplomatic occasions when 
highlevel us officials including quayle and president bush 
shunned ortega who was voted out of office feb 25 at meeting in 
costa rica last october bush referred to ortega as a little 
man trying to crash the party 
quayle and ortega were to meet again today at a luncheon given 
by aylwin for visiting dignitaries 
quayle said at the outset of his weeklong latin america trip 
last friday that he would be willing to meet with ortega and 
ortega arriving in santiago sunday night told reporters i think 
it will be a good opportunity to talk with vice president quayle 
asked what he would expect to cover in such a meeting ortega 
said we have a vast array of subjects to discuss with the us 
he declined to elaborate 
quayles chief of staff bill kristol said later i suspect 
theyll have a chance to talk one way or the other well see what 
happens tomorrow 
ortega and his sandinista government were treated with hostility 
by the bush administration but quayle said last week theres no 
reason we shouldnt talk because its a different situation 
now since ortega was ousted in nicaraguas feb 25 election by 
usbacked candidate violeta chamorro 
in addition quayle today was meeting with costa rican president 
oscar arias who won a nobel peace prize for spearheading the 
regional peace process that ultimately led to the election that 
ousted ortega 
the vice president also scheduled a meeting with aylwin to 
discuss prospects for changing the us military aid and trade 
sanctions imposed against chile in protest of the harsh rule of 
gen augusto pinochet who stepped down sunday 
we will improve relations i look forward to a very good 
meeting with president aylwin tomorrow to discuss how we can make 
progress quayle told reporters sunday 
ongoing discussions over nicaragua center on how to achieve 
demobilization of the ussupported contra rebels and pass the 
reins of government to mrs violeta chamorro 
us officials are pressing the idea that the contras could 
return to nicaragua and remain temporarily in enclaves under 
supervision of united nations forces 
arias and ortega did not attend aylwins inauguration on sunday 
they were flying from venezuela with president carlos andres perez 
aboard a plane provided by spanish prime minister felipe gonzalez 
ortega said they had talked during the flight about the contra 
situation and bringing peace to the region he said they agreed 
there should be a meeting of the central american presidents at the 
end of this month to talk about demobilizing the contras and the 
peace process 
ortega and arias were among leaders who chose to miss the 
inauguration rather than have to pay a protocol visit to pinochet 
but quayle said it was the right thing to make such a call 
and he visited pinochets home on sunday morning 
quayle was jeered by about 400 propinochet demonstrators as his 
limousine drove up they complained that the united states had been 
unfair in its diplomatic and trade pressures on pinochet 
pinochet under the constitution his regime wrote still retains 
power of chiles armed forces but quayle said after the 35minute 
meeting that the general had promised him he would respect aylwins 
authority 
he said pinochet assured him there would be no problems 
between himself and president aylwin when president aylwin gave 
an order that order would be complied with 
later as thousands massed in the square outside the 
presidential palace scattered violence broke out between political 
partisans police used tear gas that affected some quayle aides who 
were readying his motorcade for him to attend an evening concert at 
the municipal theater 
quayle saw none of the violence on the 1hour drive back to 
santiago from the inauguration in valparaiso his car edged through 
thousands of reveling aylwin supporters who were waiting for their 
new president to return to the capital

aylwins first official act was to pardon all political 
prisoners his government also restored diplomatic relations with 
the soviet union east germany yugoslavia czechoslovakia and 
poland 
chile is the last in a series of south american countries to 
restore elected civilian rule in the last decade 
but pinochet 74 who seized power in a bloody 1973 coup that 
toppled marxist president salvador allende plans to stay on as 
commander of the powerful 60000man army and has rejected aylwins 
requests he retire from the military

and moderate leftist groups assumed office to thunderous cheers 
and applause in a halffinished congressional building in the 
seaport of valparaiso 70 miles northwest of santiago 
beside him during the ceremony was pinochet his dark blue 
military uniform bedecked with gold medals the general shook 
aylwins hand after aylwin a centrist christian democrat slipped 
on the presidential sash 
aylwin has vowed to restore respect for human rights and civil 
liberties and put more emphasis on social services but he plans no 
major changes in pinochets largely successful freemarket economic 
program 
a newly elected congress dominated by foes of pinochet also 
took power sunday 
vice president dan quayle said pinochet assured him he will obey 
the new civilian government quayle who attended the inauguration 
was jeered earlier sunday by pinochet supporters upon arriving for 
a 35minute meeting at the generals walled residence

pinochet 
a us arms embargo placed on chile since 1976 because of human 
rights violations remains in effect the embargo was proposed by 
sen edward kennedy dmass who also was at the inauguration 
pinochet was forced to call elections when a proposal to extend 
his rule to 1997 was rejected in a 1988 referendum he entered the 
new congress as supporters chanted his name and detractors in the 
gallery shouted murderer murderer 
earlier a group of demonstrators tossed tomatoes and rocks at 
pinochets opentopped convertible limosine he was not injured in 
the incident which panicked horses carrying cermonially dressed 
soldiers one horse bumped hard into the car 
after the ceremony aylwin returned to santiago the capital 
and hundreds of thousands of people lined the route into the city 
to cheer as he passed in an open car 
the celebrants waved red white and blue chilean flags and 
chanted antipinochet slogans including hes fallen now hes 
fallen now for years during demonstrations against military 
rule the most popular chant was hes going to fall

barricades of burning trash and threw rocks and sticks at police 
helmeted antiriot squads responded with water cannons and harsh 
tear gas which spread through downtown streets the clashes 
persisted for several hours before calm returned leaving the 
streets full of debris including pulledup street signs and

police were seen hauling off several youths some of whom wore 
emblems of the communist or other leftist parties police sources 
said more than 100 demonstrators were arrested but no exact 
figure was immediately available

violence soiled the dignity the cleanliness of this occasion 
krauss spoke to reporters upon arrival at an evening ball for 
aylwin his closest supporters and foreign dignitaries 
another celebration was planned this evening in santiagos 
national stadium long a symbol of political repression and human 
rights abuse under pinochet upon seizing power the pinochet 
regime rounded up thousands of suspected dissidents in the stadium 
they were interrogated and according to human rights groups many 
were tortured and some were executed 
a clause in the 1980 constitution written by pinochets 
administration bars any new president from replacing him as army 
commander before 1998 aylwins term ends in 1994

the entire communist party 
leadership resigned today in response to opposition demands and the 
leader of the longtime soviet client state said the ruling party 
must renew itself to head off crisis 
the fiveman politburo of the mongolian peoples revolutionary 
party voted to abolish the constitutional clause declaring the 
party the leading force in society 
it also set april 10 as the date for a special party congress to 
elect a new central committee that in the words of party general 
secretary zhambyn batmonh should be younger and in favor of reform 
the politburo voted to hold early elections this year for the 
new legislature the great peoples hural an exact date was not 
set 
the moves were obvious concessions to protesters who crowded the 
central square of the capital ulan bator on friday to demand 
change in the partys leadership and an emergency party congress 
the demonstrations shown on soviet television were evidence 
that the winds of democratic change that swept through eastern 
europe last year have reached asia mongolia is a sparsely 
populated nation on the sovietchinese border 
the mongolian democratic union an organization similar to the 
grassroots citizens groups that have sprung up in the soviet union 
is demanding an end to the communist partys 69yearold monopoly 
on power a mutiparty system and resignation of the premier 
cabinet and legislature 
it has also called for new elections and for the withdrawal of 
soviet troops 
two years ago mongolias leaders followed the lead of soviet 
president mikhail s gorbachev and embarked on political and 
economic reforms but critics say it has been moving too slowly 
batmonh announced the politburo decision in a speech to the 
120member central committee that was broadcast live he also said 
he was giving up his no 1 job in the party though mongolian 
officials did not rule out the possibility that those who resigned 
might be reelected 
as chairman of the hurals presidium batmonh is also mongolias 
head of state and that job was not affected by todays 
announcement 
the politburo decisions must be approved by the central 
committee but all are expected to pass the committee which began 
meeting after the politburo session will continue its meeting on 
tuesday 
batmonh said the partys main task is to build human and 
democratic socialism on the soil of mongolia it is important to 
renew our party leadership with younger people people who are 
clever and constructive and for perestroika 
he said the party should be the leading force in society but 
should acquire that status by its work and not from a 
constitutional article 
we also recognize the main principle of marxismleninism 
batmonh added national unity and stability are very important 
for perestroika 
a foreign ministry official said the next step after the 
central committee approves the politburo measures will be 
establishment of a commission to prepare for the april party 
congress batmonh said this commission could include younger 
reformminded members 
one of the tasks of the new hural once elected will be to 
approve a new constitution work on the draft has already started 
one of the goals of the new constitution will be to separate the 
roles of party and government 
batmonh said the draft for new party rules already being worked 
on internally should be published and discussed widely 
the central committee has received many letters from ordinary 
workers and party organizations he said some scientists sent 
an open letter to the central committee and worked out a draft 
program for party renewal 
he said all of these suggestions were being considered 
the party is ready to have active cooperation and negotiations 
with every force that is for democracy socialism and improving the 
welfare of our people the mongolian leader said the mongolian 
peoples revolutionary party will fight against forces that are 
against the interests of the people and extremist organizations 
batmonh also called for renewed effort to rehabilitate people 
wrongly punished in past political purges 
there was a bad tradition that those who criticized the 
leaders of the party were punished he said he said this 
tradition should be eradicated and any possibility of a cult of 
personality reemerging should be ruled out

aids patients taking an experimental drug under 
their own doctors supervision have been dying at more than 10 
times the rate of those taking the drug in clinical tests the new 
york times reported today 
out of 8000 patients taking the new drug in an expanded 
distribution program 290 have died the newspaper said 
but in clinical trials by the drugs manufacturer bristolmyers 
squibb only two of the 700 patients taking ddi or dideoxyinosine 
have died the company said 
the food and drug administration set up the expanded access 
program last august after people with aids and their supporters 
demanded the drug be made available through private doctors even 
before it was fully tested 
aids sufferers groups said they were willing to risk taking the 
drug which previously has been linked to pancreatitis to fight 
the fatal disease 
i think its a painful way to learn the lesson but maybe its 
the only way theyll learn that to my mind they did the wrong 
thing said dr thomas c chalmers associate director of the 
technology assessment group at the harvard university school of 
public health 
bristolmyers squibb said the increased death rate needs to be 
kept in context 
were dealing with a very very sick population said 
kathryn bloom a spokeswoman for the drug company 
she said the company thus far attributes the deaths to aids 
not the drug with the possible exception of five deaths from 
pancreatitis one death from pancreatitis was reported in the 
clinical tests

vice president dan quayle headed the us 
delegation to the presidential inauguration in chile but another 
entourage member clearly was the bigger celebrity here sen 
edward kennedy 
from the arrival of air force two on saturday night the 
massachusetts democrat was unmistakably the center of attention 
after quayle made brief arrival remarks at the airport and 
prepared to leave the local reporters and tv crews shouted for 
kennedy to say something 
when the senator and quayle stood together camera shutters 
clicked nonstop 
kennedy proclaimed it extraordinary to breathe the free air of 
chile 
he is famous here both because of the affection the latin people 
hold for his two slain brothers president john f kennedy and 
sen robert kennedy and also because of his advocacy of human 
rights in chile 
kennedy crusaded against the military dictatorship of gen 
augusto pinochet who transferred the presidency on sunday to 
patricio aylwin 
kennedy was the featured speaker saturday night at a dinner 
honoring human rights victims 
he also met with opposition activists with whom he has 
established relations over the years 
one gave me his voting card he said it was the most precious 
thing he owned kennedy said during a brief morning stroll 
outside his hotel where a local tv crew shadowed him 
a round of applause erupted among the chilean correspondents in 
a press room at aylwins inauguration when kennedy was shown on a 
tv screen

not everyone was happy to see kennedy in the nation that gave 
pinochet 43 percent approval vote in a 1988 plebiscite 
propinochet demonstrators who greeted quayles motorcade when 
he visited the outgoing president on sunday morning chanted 
antiamerican slogans including go away 
asked if they wanted quayle to leave some told a reporter they 
did but one woman interjected its not quayle its kennedy we 
want to go home 
kennedys motorcade was pelted with rocks and eggs on his last 
visit in 1986 this time the senator was afforded his own secret 
service detail during his stay in chile 
describing the difference in the countrys mood on inauguration 
day a clearly pleased kennedy observed it was just smoke and 
riot gear last time

although they were representing the united states together in 
chile the democratic senator couldnt resist having some political 
fun with quayle on the flight down 
quayle was conducting a questionandanswer session with 
reporters when kennedy burst into the cabin bearing a gift for the 
vice president 
he handed him a red new england patriots jersey with quayles 
name and the number 96 on it 
the reference to the 1996 presidential election was lost on no 
one quayle who does not discuss his future election plans 
laughingly took the shirt without comment 
kennedy was also mum when asked later if he was trying to say 
that the democrats would like quayle to be their republican 
opponent in 1996 
quayles public opinion ratings are as low as president bushs 
are high a fact that is not lost on democrats looking to a 
postbush era

en route to sundays inauguration ceremony quayle made a 
typical motorcade stop to greet unsuspecting bystanders 
as he shook hands he repeated democracy democracy in a 
refrain praising the nations return to democratic government after 
16 years of military dictatorship 
one man told him the american people is very good now we 
need help in the united states economic help for help democracy

quayle often stops to buy gifts for his children on his foreign 
trips 
a stop in a curio shop in valparaiso resulted in a purchase 
however that was anything but pgrated 
he picked up a small wooden doll that looked like a simple 
native icon until its head was pulled then it became anatomically 
correct 
quayle laughed with surprise turned his back to the watching 
cameras and asked the shopkeeper what it cost 
i can take this home he joked calling to his unsuspecting 
wife standing nearby marilyn 
dan youre not buying that she shrieked 
when he laughed she exclaimed youre sick 
not to be dissuaded the vice president sent an aide in for the

the first of nearly 50000 soviet 
troops stationed in hungary left for home today two days after 
moscow and budapest signed an agreement on the total withdrawal of 
red army soldiers by mid1991 
the withdrawal began near the town of hajmasker about 75 miles 
southwest of budapest with the pullout of a battalion comprised of 
300 soldiers and 40 armored personnel carriers 
hungary on saturday became the second warsaw pact country to 
negotiate a full soviet withdrawal from its territory 
last month prague and moscow agreed that the kremlin would 
bring home all of its 73500 soviet troops stationed in 
czechoslovakia the pullout there began feb 26 
the withdrawals from both countries are due to be completed by 
june 30 1991 and a total of 123200 soviet troops are scheduled to 
be removed 
both agreements are independent of any accord reached at 
eastwest troop reduction talks under way in vienna 
the agreement on the pullout from hungary was signed in moscow 
saturday by soviet foreign minister eduard shevardnadze and his 
hungarian counterpart gyula horn who traveled to the soviet 
capital for the official signing 
the soviet union currently has 49700 troops stationed in 
hungary as well as 27146 military vehicles including 860 tanks 
and 1500 armoured personnel carriers it also has six airports in 
hungary according to deputy chief of staff jozsef biro who 
released details of the soviet presence for the first time two 
weeks ago 
hungarian radio reported saturday that the two governments were 
still negotiating on the property being left behind by the soviet 
troops 
according to the report twothirds of the withdrawal of soviet 
troops and equipment is to be completed by the end of this year 
the start of the withdrawal comes barely two weeks before 
hungarians go to the polls march 25 for their first free multiparty 
elections since the communists consolidated power in 1948 
some opposition members have suggested the new government might 
seek to renegotiate the withdrawal agreement with moscow to move up 
the completion date

oliver north testified today that he had 
general instructions from john poindexter to conceal his activities 
aiding the contras from members of the house intelligence committee 
norths second day of testimony at poindexters trial brought 
rebukes from the judge who complained that its like pulling 
teeth to get north to answer fully questions from the prosecution 
prosecutor dan webb hammered away at norths assertion friday 
that nobody told me to lie at an aug 6 1986 meeting with 
members of congress in the white house situation room 
had north been generally instructed by poindexter to 
conceal facts from congress asked webb 
yes conceal or withhold replied north adding that he had 
been directed to keep such matters secret from foreign governments 
and others 
from congress north was asked 
yes its inclusive in that north replied after webb 
confronted the former white house aide with testimony he gave to 
congress on july 8 1987 in which he acknowledged getting the 
instructions 
its like pulling teeth to get north to answer webbs 
questions us district court judge harold greene said as north 
resumed testifying 
greene twice rebuked north telling him at one point lets 
try to stick to the facts 
yes your honor north replied 
at another point the judge complained to north that he 
quibbles with the prosecutors characterizations at certain 
times while you embroider at others 
poindexter is accused of obstructing congress by allegedly 
concealing norths contra activities he also is accused of 
conspiracy another count of obstruction and two counts of making 
false statements in connection with a november 1985 shipment of 
hawk antiaircraft missiles to iran 
webb had said friday he would open todays questioning of north 
by focusing on the missile shipment 
but the prosecutor returned to the aug 6 1986 meeting on the 
contras north had testified that he resisted going to that 
meeting but that poindexter directed him to go anyway however 
north on friday said neither poindexter nor anyone else directed 
him to lie at the meeting 
before norths testimony resumed webb asked for permission to 
elicit testimony about norths three felony convictions in the 
irancontra affair he was convicted of aiding and abetting an 
obstruction of congress destroying documents relating to his 
contra activities and accepting an illegal gratuity the judge said 
he would rule on the question later today 
regarding the hawk missiles north kept poindexter his boss on 
the national security council staff informed of the missile 
shipment at the time it occurred poindexter however told the 
house and senate intelligence committees on nov 21 1986 that he 
did not learn of the delivery until more than a month after it was 
completed 
poindexter says he gave incorrect information to the committees 
because he had simply forgotten a year later that he knew of the 
shipment beforehand 
irancontra prosecutors are unfairly bringing charges against 
poindexter for a fiveweek mistake defense attorney richard 
beckler said in opening arguments last week 
the ciaassisted delivery was authorized retroactively by a 
presidential document that poindexter destroyed the same day he 
made his incorrect statements to the intelligence committees 
the politically embarrassing document known as a finding 
depicted the us government as being involved in a straight 
armsforhostages deal with iran 
north testified at his own trial last year that he watched 
poindexter destroy the paper 
i saw the finding torn up north said then i saw him tear 
it in two 
the government alleges the existence of the document was 
poindexters motive for concealing from congress us involvement 
in the november 1985 missile 
but at a pretrial hearing in poindexters case last december 
north said he understood the destroyed document was the finding 
only after watching poindexter testify about it in nationally 
televised congressional hearings 
us district judge harold greene said north was 
prevaricating at the december hearing in an attempt avoid 
having to testify against his exboss 
poindexter was granted conditional immunity by congress for his 
testimony and no part of a prosecution may be derived from the 
immunized testimony of a defendant 
greene however said norths testimony at the december hearing 
was not believable and that prosecutors would be allowed to elicit 
norths testimony on the destruction of the document 
on friday north reluctantly testified that poindexter directed 
him to take care of congressional inquiries about whether he 
was assisting the nicaraguan contra rebels militarily 
but north insisted that he himself made the decision to lie when 
he met with the congressmen and that neither poindexter nor anyone 
else ordered him to do so

a divided soviet congress today debated the 
powerful presidency championed by mikhail s gorbachev as essential 
for democracy and the proposal faced possible rejection for lack 
of the required twothirds majority 
but one progressive deputy who has fought placing so much power 
in the hands of one man said he would have to cave in if gorbachev 
were to stake his own leadership on the issue 
and gorbachevs vice president argued that the proposal for a 
new presidency rules out personal dictatorship 
the session fell behind schedule and closed for the day without 
a vote on the presidency despite gorbachevs urgings to keep to a 
tight schedule 
the divisions in the 2250member congress of peoples deputies 
reflected the turmoil in soviet politics as gorbachev begins his 
sixth year as soviet leader 
the president and communist party chief told the 2087 deputies 
present that they would be asked to amend the constitution to 
revoke the partys monopoly on power create a new presidency and 
if the presidency proposal is adopted to elect the new president 
we find ourselves in a paralysis of power said sergei 
alexeyev chairman of the congress constitutional committee who 
took the floor in support of gorbachev the presidency is the 
only way to transfer the real power from the party to the 
government 
if the presidency issue is resolved positively we can get 
down to drafting a new constitution immediately which will confirm 
human rights democracy and conversion to a market economy he 
said 
the president will have the power to veto laws appoint a 
cabinet declare a state of emergency and presidential rule 
opponents say that concentrates too much power in the hands of one 
person 
progressive moscow parliamentarian alexei yablokov predicted a 
boycott of the vote on the presidency by many of the deputies from 
georgia moldavia azerbaijan estonia and latvia 
on friday georgias parliament denounced the office as 
authoritarian presidential rule 
before the session began progressive parliamentarian sergei 
stankevich said he expected about a third of the deputies to 
abstain from voting on the expanded presidency 
estonian deputy igor griazin said the estonian delegation would 
abstain because prticipating in the creation of the presidency 
can be interpreted as an indirect acknowledgement of moscows 
rule 
estonia although it has not gone as far as lithuania has moved 
to distance itself from the kremlin lithuania declared itself 
independent on sunday 
as the congress session opened today gorbachev noting the 
absence of the chairman of the lithuanian delegation said the 
information coming from lithuania is alarming and momentous 
decisions are being made there that will affect both lithuania and 
the soviet union 
most of the lithuanian seats at the congress in the kremlin were 
vacant 
gorbachev gave no indication he would seek to prevent 
lithuanias secession although he has opposed it 
stankevich said gorbachev could turn the presidency issue into a 
vote of confidence in his own stewardship if the soviet leader 
threatened to resign stankevich said then the deputies will give 
him what he wants 
the legislator who strongly objects to the specific powers 
given to the president in the draft said that if gorbachev 
threatened to resign he would throw his support behind him i 
will vote for gorbachev stankevich said 
gorbachev has said the new presidency is necessary to ensure 
that his campaign for democratization and domestic reform do not 
fail his view was overwhelmingly endorsed on feb 27 by the 
countrys smaller working legislature the supreme soviet which is 
elected by the congress from among its own membership 
vice president anatoly i lukyanov in his speech to the 
congress on today stressed the limits that would be placed on the 
new president 
he said the president would be subject to recall by the congress 
and that the proposal would for the first time establish a clear 
balance of power between the legislative and executive branches of 
government 
gorbachev in his present post holds executive authority while 
also presiding over the congress of peoples deputies and the 
supreme soviet 
lukyanov also pointed out a presidential veto could be 
overridden by a twothirds majority of both houses of the supreme 
soviet legislature which is similar to the us presidents veto 
power and while the soviet president would have power to declare 
war lukyanov said the president would be required to immediately 
solicit the determination of the supreme soviet 
the new office must be created by a constitutional amendment 
which requires a twothirds majority of all deputies not just 
those voting 
a boycott by a substantial number of deputies therefore could 
torpedo the proposal 
members of the interregional group a parliamentary opposition 
of some 400 congress members planned either to vote against the 
proposed constitutional amendments establishing the presidency or 
abstain group leader gavriil popov told a news conference sunday 
interregional group members say their constituents want the 
right to directly elect the president from the start 
however popov said the opposition deputies would not field a 
candidate to oppose gorbachev

teachers across west virginia today 
heeded their unions refusal to call off a growing strike despite a 
warning from the governor that those who didnt come back could 
lose their jobs 
a proposed settlement of the states first teacher walkout 
collapsed over the weekend the largest teachers union says west 
virginia has the secondlowest teachers salaries in the nation 
the strike over pay began wednesday and by today had spread to 
46 of the states 55 counties classes were canceled in at least 27 
counties for more than 150000 pupils about half the states 
enrollment 
in ohio county classes had to be canceled when officials found 
most of the districts 47 school buses had flat tires 
superintendent h lawrence jones said it was unclear who was 
responsible he added 
leaders of the 16000member west virginia education association 
recommended continuing the strike until gov gaston caperton 
promises to call a special legislative session to consider pay 
raises but caperton said he wont consider calling a special 
session until the teachers go back to work 
last week attorney general roger tompkins declared the strike 
illegal and said any teachers who walk off the job can be 
suspended fired barred from teaching for a year and charged with 
misdemeanors 
after the proposed settlement collapsed caperton said he would 
ask county superintendents to begin disciplinary action against any 
teachers who continue to strike 
state school superintendent hank marockie met on sunday with the 
55 county superintendents but said he would wait to see how many 
teachers returned today before deciding what action to recommend 
teachers are employed by county school boards and it is up to 
county school superintendents to take any action against striking 
teachers including suspension or firing 
county superintendents will follow those rules and make it 
strict and the consequences are pretty bad caperton said its 
very clear by law what theyre to do ive asked them to do that 
association members voted overwhelmingly saturday to go back to 
work for 30 days if caperton called a special legislative session 
but association president kayetta meadows accused the governor of 
reneging on a promise to call a special session and she said late 
saturday we have no choice but to continue a statewide strike 
caperton termed meadows accusation a total lie but he did 
not rule out calling a special session 
we did not commit ourselves or close the door to a special 
session caperton spokesman gc morse said this is 
ludicrous 
leaders of the other main striking union the 3000member west 
virginia federation of teachers recommended an end to the strike 
but said the decision was up to teachers in each county 
another 3000 teachers are not represented by either union 
the associations former president tom vogel late sunday urged 
striking members to ignore meadows and return to work today 
the governor assured me he will begin talking immediately upon 
the return of teachers to the classroom said vogel who did not 
run for reelection in 1988 and was replaced by meadows 
we have stood proud and tall and we have made our point but 
now is the time to solve the problems and the only way we really 
can is by working directly with the governor and the legislature 
saturdays aborted settlement was the second in a week last 
monday the governor and legislative leaders offered teachers a 5 
percent raise but withdrew the proposal 14 hours later saying the 
associations refusal to lift its strike threat ruined any chance 
of passage in the legislature 
the association says the average west virginia teacher salary of 
21904 ranks the state 49th in the nation that figure does not 
include a 5 percent raise teachers received in february teachers 
objected when the governor provided no money in his 199091 budget 
for an additional raise

the bush administration today expressed 
support anew for lithuanias move toward independence but said it 
will delay formal recognition of the breakaway republic until the 
lithuanians are in control of their own destiny 
white house spokesman marlin fitzwater reiterated the 
administrations call upon the soviet central government to 
respect the will of the citizens of the baltic state 
but the administration stopped short of recognizing the 
government formed by a unanimous vote sunday of the new lithuanian 
parliament in vilnius 
soviet president mikhail s gorbachev opening a congress of 
communist party deputies today in moscow called lithuanias 
declaration of independence alarming but gave no indication he 
plans any action to prevent the baltic republic from seceding 
gorbachev has said previously that lithuania would have to pay 
the kremlin 34 billion for the factories and other infrastructure 
built during a halfcentury of soviet rule lithuanians say they 
are owed even more for decades of soviet repression including 
mass deportations to siberia under stalin 
fitzwater asked at a briefing why the united states did not 
immediately recognize the new lithuanian government said 
because we would want any recognition to take into account a 
final government that was in control of their own destiny and much 
of that has yet to be negotiated with the soviet union 
he emphasized the united states has never recognized the soviet 
unions forcible annexation in 1940 of lithuania and its two sister 
baltic republics estonia and latvia he said the united states 
wants to foster productive negotiations 
we believe this is the right measure of support fitzwater 
said it reflects our policy of many years of not recognizing 
their incorporation in the first place it reflects the fact that 
they still have negotiations to carry out that we want to be 
successful 
the white house in a statement sunday by fitzwater urged 
gorbachev to enter immediate constructive negotiations with the 
lithuanians and said we have consistently supported the baltic 
peoples inalienable right to peaceful selfdetermination 
it urged the soviet government to respect the will of the 
citizens of lithuania as expressed through their freely elected 
representatives 
the united states also expects the government of lithuania to 
consider the rights of its minority population he said 
we hope that all parties will continue to avoid any initiation 
or encouragement of violence fitzwater said 
a lithuanian diplomat in washington said western governments are 
likely to wait to recognize lithuanias declaration of independence 
until its leaders resolve disputes with moscow and establish 
control over their country 
stasys lozoraitis charge daffaires for lithuania said us 
officials had told him beforehand they want to see the government 
take over effective control before formally recognizing it 
all western powers are inclined to wait the lithuanian 
diplomat said but he predicted recognition could come after one 
month or two 
the united states and other western nations have never 
recognized the soviet unions forcible annexation of lithuania and 
its baltic neighbors while under red army occupation the three 
states once part of czarist russia had gained independence after 
world war i 
in 1940 a year after the infamous nonaggression pact between 
stalins soviet union and hitlers germany the soviet army imposed 
regimes that rubberstamped the three republics incorporation into 
the soviet union 
the baltic states were overrun by hitlers nazi troops and 
subject to terror and death camps and terrorized again by stalins

the labor party today blamed prime minister 
yitzhak shamirs rightwing likud bloc for undermining peace 
efforts and authorized party leaders to bring down the coalition 
government 
in a nationally broadcast speech labor leader shimon peres told 
the 1300 members of the centerleft partys central committee that 
shamir was stalling and would not respond to us peace proposals 
we have reached a conclusion that shamir will try to run a 
policy of saying neither yes or no he will try to avoid the 
decision and will pull us into the desert of indecision said 
peres who is finance minister and vice premier 
on sunday shamir refused to allow the 12member inner cabinet 
to vote on a usbacked peace plan which aims to set up 
preliminary peace talks between palestinian and israeli delegations 
in cairo 
the labor members today approved a vaguely worded resolution 
with only one member dissenting the resolution authorized the 
party leadership and the 39 labor members in the 120seat 
parliament to determine the parliamentary moves necessitated by 
the situation 
that gave peres a mandate to join with other smaller parties to 
support a noconfidence motion expected to be brought before 
parliament thursday unless a compromise can be worked out in the 
meantime 
a noconfidence vote would bring down the 15monthold 
government 
before the labor announcement religion minister zevulun hammer 
met separately with israels four top political leaders shamir 
peres foreign minister moshe arens of likud and defense minister 
yitzhak rabin of labor to try to mediate a compromise israel 
radio said 
but shamir aide avi pazner said there seemed little room left 
for agreement 
it looks like the two parties are going for a showdown 
thursday it would take a miracle to reach a compromise before 
that he said 
israeli newspapers said shamir was considering firing the labor 
cabinet ministers to prevent them from becoming part of a 
transitional government which would be set up if parliament gave 
the government a noconfidence vote 
the labor party would then be in a weaker position if national 
elections are called the englishlanguage jerusalem post said it 
would also put the transitional government entirely under shamir 
labor has backed the proposals put forward by us secretary of 
state james a baker iii to begin preliminary peace talks 
shamir and his likud bloc have resisted the baker plan saying 
his call for participation in the talks by residents of arab east 
jerusalem could threaten israels declared sovereignty over the 
area 
they also oppose allow deportees from the territories to 
participate saying this could provide a backdoor entry to the plo 
israel considers the palestine liberation organization a 
terrorist organization and refuses to deal with it 
also today israeli troops shot and killed a palestinian youth 
jemal muhammed haleefa 17 during a stonethrowing clash in the 
ahbat jaber refugee camp in jericho arab hospital officials said 
the army confirmed the death and said soldiers opened fired when 
attacked by a group of masked youths 
haleefas death raised to 653 the number of palestinians killed 
by israelis during the 27month revolt against israeli rule of the 
occupied west bank and gaza strip 
another 195 palestinians have been killed by fellow arabs most 
on suspicion of collaborating with israel and 43 israelis have 
died in the violence

gave birth to the surrealist movement 
born in the exclusive paris suburb of chaville and educated at 
the sorbonne soupault was influenced by the works of marcel proust 
and his voyages to germany and england 
but the horrors of world war i proved a stronger influence and 
in march 1919 he joined breton and louis aragon to found the review 
literature 
the magazine quickly became the standardbearer for 
intellectuals disillusioned with the bourgeois culture they 
believed caused the war 
the journal published soupaults poem westwego and other 
works but he eventually fell out with breton and the surrealist 
movement accusing it of having become politicized

negro he turned to journalism in the 1930s reporting for the 
petit parisien newspaper and founding radio tunis in 1938 
he married renee niemeyer in 1937 they had two daughters

beijing on monday and expressed high hope the two countries 
would soon agree to diplomatic relations

officials but conferred with us ambassador james lilley and 
pakistan ambassador m akram zaki during his hourlong stay at 
beijing airport

11day trip that will take him to pakistan india czechoslovakia 
bulgaria and yugoslavia 
in czechoslovakia and bulgaria choi is to sign protocols 
establishing normal diplomatic relations with those countries 
choi said he was carrying no messages for chinese officials and 
that his only objective during the stopover was to meet his old 
friend lilley who formerly served as us envoy to seoul 
we can exchange views on china he said but there will be 
no formal proposals 
we always have high hope of normalizing relations with 
china he said i dont know how soon it can be realized but 
ive already offered to meet with the foreign minister when the 
situation is right 
choi is likely to meet one key chinese official during his trip 
deng pufang the son of senior leader deng xiaoping was on the 
same flight to pakistan for a visit in his capacity as head of the 
china federation of handicapped people 
lilley asked if the united states could serve as a gobetween 
in bringing about relations between china and south korea said 
no were not in the best position to do that us relations 
with china are badly strained by washingtons criticisms of 
beijings human rights record and its suppression of political 
dissent 
chois predecessor choi kwangsoo also stopped at beijing 
airport in august 1988 for a meeting with former us ambassador 
winston lord then too there were no contacts with chinese 
officials

billion a year but china remains politically tied to south koreas 
bitter rivals the communist government in north korea

for north korea this week on his first foreign trip and the north 
koreans are certain to seek reassurances that beijing is not 
leaning toward more ties with seoul 
choi said he was very happy to visit east europe and 
formalize relations with the two socialist states there 
our private sectors are very much enthusiastic to promote 
economic exchange and cooperation he said i think the 
establishment of relations will create a very good atmosphere for 
businessmen to move into those countries 
south korea already has diplomatic relations with hungary 
poland and yugoslavia and plans to start normalization talks soon 
with romania and east germany 
the anticommunist government in seoul has also increased 
contacts with the soviet union and choi said he would ask pakistan 
and india to act as gobetweens in helping south korea establish 
formal ties with moscow and beijing

the communist party central committee called 
today for the party to strengthen ties with the people many of 
whom became disillusioned with the communists after last years 
crackdown on the student prodemocracy movement 
the central committee concluded a fourday meeting the first 
since november when it approved a threeyear economic austerity 
program and announced senior leader deng xiaoping was resigning 
from his last party post news of the semiannual meeting was 
carried by the official xinhua news agency 
the party has been concerned about popular unrest because of the 
economic downturn and the harsh political climate following the 
military repression of dissent last june that left hundreds 
perhaps thousands dead 
as a result the party was expected to ease some austerity 
measures such as loosening credit to moneystarved industries but 
any decisions probably will not be announced until the national 
peoples congress chinas rubberstamp legislature convenes 
next week 
instead the central committee issued a communique saying the 
partys ties to the masses are its fundamental working line and 
also its fine tradition and political asset according to xinhua 
it acknowledged that people have become disenchanted with the 
party because of its bureaucracy subjectivism formalism 
passivism and corruption 
the communique did not specifically say how ties might be 
strengthened but in recent days the official media have reported 
the arrests of several officials on corruption charges in an 
attempt to show the party will not tolerate such activities 
the chinese also have become disillusioned with the partys 
economic policies which have led to runaway inflation the closure 
of thousands of factories and layoffs of millions of workers 
but the document said china was on the right track with its 
economic reform and called on all party members to follow 
firmly and in an allaround way the basic line of taking economic 
construction as the central task

japanese commuters long accustomed to the crush of 
humanity and shoves and sneezes of fellow passengers began 
suffering another indignity monday rush hour trains without seats 
the yamanote line one of tokyos most heavily traveled routes 
introduced new cars with seats that can be lowered or folded back 
into the wall at the touch of a button 
the seats will stay folded to ease crowding until the end of the 
morning rush hour at 10 am creating what one japanese tv 
announcer called a freighttrain feeling aboard the cars 
were being treated like baggage complained a middleage 
man riding one of the four new cars introduced on just two trains 
as an experiment 
but another woman said the standingroomonly cars looked 
neater and lesscrowded than regular trains which sometimes are 
so packed that riders have only enough space to place one foot on 
the floor and can let go of a bag without it falling to the ground 
its an attempt to ease the overcrowding well see what the 
reaction is and then make a decision on whether to expand their 
use a railroad official said 
train officials say there are very few ways left to ease the 
crush of the growing crowds that press their way sometimes with 
the aid of train employees who push from behind onto tokyos 
rushhour trains 
of the 32 million people who live in and around the capital 
about half reportedly use mass transit for commuting an estimated 
5 million people each day ride the yamanote line which loops 
around central tokyo the railway official said 
during rush hour many lines in the city are at full capacity 
meaning that no more trains can be squeezed into the schedule 
on the yamanote line 10car trains run every 2 minutes during 
rush hour while trains on slowermoving subway lines arrive every 
two minutes 
an attempt two years ago to revise safety rules to narrow the 
gap between trains on the sobu line was abandoned after one train 
slammed into another at a station killing two people 
we cant run any more trains because weve reached the maximum 
capacity said the railroad official who spoke on condition of 
anonymity all we can do is try to ease the current situation 
the new cars have six doors on each side compared with the 
normal four to allow passengers on and off trains more easily 
they officially are supposed to carry a maximumb 162 people 18 
more than the regular cars during rush hour however many more 
people jam into the cars 
i usually cant sit down anyway so i think the new 
arrangement is good said one young woman a male rider expressed 
concern about older people who are unable to sit on the new trains 
our hope is to improve service for the largest number of 
passengers another railway official said we hope the public 
will understand 
the japan broadcasting corp timed passengers getting on and off 
trains at a station monday and found that the new design was about 
10 seconds faster 
but despite the seatless design at least one of the new cars 
was so crowded monday that train employees had to resort to the old 
technique of pushing passengers into the doors to allow the train 
to depart on time

more than 400 birdwatchers turned up at the 
crack of dawn at a sewage plant to get a glimpse of an apparently 
disoriented arctic bird rarely seen south of canada a rosss gull 
i woke up at 415 to come out here said george armistead 
16 of philadelphia i never thought id see the day when a 
rosss gull would land so close i could make the drive in a little 
over two hours 
at 835 am sunday someone finally spotted the gull in flight 
it eventually settled down to preen for a halfhour near a creek 
behind the back river treatment plant in suburban baltimore 
what makes this rosss gull so unique is that every other past 
record has been a oneday wonder said birdwatcher rick blom 
this rosss gull has already been in baltimore for more than a 
week 
blom said the gull is a longdistance migrator that has a 
tendency to get blown off course 
the first confirmed us sighting of a rosss gull was believed 
to have been in 1975 in salisbury beach mass unconfirmed 
sightings have been reported as far afield as tennessee and

military observers to the exercises which began in 1976 
there has been no response from china or other communist 
countries invited to observe what us and south korean officials 
termed the defensive exercise 
as in the past north korea rejected the invitation and put its 
entire armed forces on alert saying the exercises are a sign of 
us agression north korea also cut off all dialogue with south 
korea

president mikhail s gorbachev today called 
lithuanias declaration of independence alarming but gave no 
indication he plans any action to prevent the baltic republic from 
breaking away 
he did not however acknowledge the legality of the move 
continuing to refer to lithuania as a soviet republic and not by 
the new name adopted by lithuanias legislature 
another member of the ruling communist party politburo told 
reporters that the kremlin will deal peacefully with lithuania 
we will not use force yegor k ligachev told reporters at 
the congress of peoples deputies in moscow we must resolve this 
by political means ligachev is believed to be one of the more 
conservative members of the partys ruling body 
gorbachev opening a new session of the congress noted that the 
chairman of the lithuanian delegation was absent from his chair on 
the stage with other members of the presidium 
the information coming from lithuania is alarming and 
momentous decisions are being made there that will affect both 
lithuania and the soviet union gorbachev told more than 2000 
deputies 
the lawmakers had assembled in moscow today to consider 
constitutional amendments that would create a new extraordinarily 
powerful soviet president and revoke the communist partys monopoly 
on power 
gorbachev said the congress should study the decisions adopted 
in the lithuanian soviet socialist republic ignoring the 
republic legislatures action sunday declaring a sovereign 
republic of lithuania 
just two weeks after proindependence candidates won a twothird 
majority in lithuanias legislature the body met in the lithuanian 
capital vilnius and voted to restore sovereignty after 50 years 
of soviet rule 
lithuanian lawmakers acknowledge though that true independence 
can only be won after long difficult negotiations with the kremlin 
the hasty vote to secede was prompted by the convening of the 
congress to consider giving a new president powers that would 
include the authority to dissolve republic parliaments and nullify 
their actions 
the newly elected legislature of the baltic republic of 37 
million people voted 1240 with six abstentions to secede it also 
chose vytautas landsbergis chairman of the nationalist sajudis 
movement as president 
the supreme council of the republic of lithuania expressing 
the will of the nation resolves and solemnly proclaims that the 
execution of the sovereign power of the lithuanian state 
heretofore constrained by alien forces in 1940 is restored the 
legislature decreed 
henceforth lithuania is once again an independent state it 
said 
the decree proclaims that the local kgb and police for most of 
five decades instruments of soviet terror and repression must now 
obey lithuania rather than moscow 
after it was approved legislators stood and joined hands 
chanting lietuva lietuva lithuania outside a small crowd 
broke into wild cheers earlier people tore down a metal soviet 
hammerandsickle seal over the buildings door and some stamped on 
it 
thats the end of the soviet regime said a jubilant deputy 
looking on 
by itself the decree effects little change in the relationship 
between the baltic republic and the kremlin but it was the first 
crack in the union of 15 soviet republics and more than 100 
nationalities as a result of the burgeoning demands for autonomy 
fostered by gorbachevs reforms 
in washington the bush administration expressed support for 
lithuanias move toward independence but said it will delay formal 
recognition until the lithuanians are in control of their own 
destiny 
white house press secretary marlin fitzwater said the united 
states would urge the kremlin to respect the will of the citizens 
of lithuania the united states has never recognized the forcible 
1940 annexation of the three soviet republics estonia latvia and 
lithuania 
in estonia on sunday an unofficial congress of delegates 
elected by a majority of the republics people denounced the soviet 
annexation and sought un assistance in achieving independence 
in addition to changing their homelands name the lithuanian 
legislators dropped the old seal that included a soviet hammer 
sickle and star replacing it with one showing a white knight on a 
dark shield 
today they were to consider a declaration touching the 
thousands of soviet soldiers on lithuanian soil 
lithuanias declaration of independence represents perhaps the 
biggest crisis yet for gorbachev who marked his fifth anniversary 
as soviet leader on sunday 
the outgoing president of lithuanias parliament communist 
party chief algirdas brazauskas said before the vote that approval 
of secession could have a contagious effect on other republics 
gorbachevs troubles include rumblings for independence 
elsewhere serious economic problems and ethnic strife in many 
areas of the nation 
leaders of sajudis which dominates the new lithuanian 
legislature acknowledged that full independence would have to be 
won in long difficult negotiations 
how soon we can implement this law depends not only on us 
landsbergis told a news conference 
we have to sit down at the table he told legislators in a 
statement were not going to be beating our fists but we have 
to start settling accounts 
gorbachev has said lithuania will have to pay the kremlin 34 
billion for the factories and other infrastructure built during a 
halfcentury of soviet rule lithuanians say their bill for decades 
of soviet repression including mass deportations to siberia under 
stalin will be even higher 
landsbergis a 57yearold music professor received 91 votes 
for the presidency in sundays vote with 42 against brazauskas 
got 38 votes with 95 against 
stalin absorbed lithuania latvia and estonia all independent 
between the world wars under a secret agreement with germany on 
the eve of the nazi attack on poland that started world war ii

demonstrations toppled governments in eastern 
europe last year and now there are demonstrations here but with a 
big difference 
twice last week members of the small human rights community met 
at differrent locales to try to advance their cause both times 
they were rudely interrupted by hundreds of noisy progovernment 
street demonstrators 
according to the communist party newspaper granma neighbors 
became aware of a dissident meeting thursday at the home of a 
wellknown activist before long with the help of indignant 
passersby a crowd had formed outside 
the protest like a similar incident march 5 has been labeled 
an act of repudiation by the communist party media 
dissidents contend the protests are governmentorchestrated the 
media insists they are spontaneous 
either way the demonstrations seem to help the government in 
its quest to nip potential trouble in the bud if those who 
disagree gain a foothold life for the government could become 
complicated 
as things stand the movement of cubans who want more freedom is 
small demoralized and fearful two of the best known activists 
elizardo sanchez and roberto bahamonde have been in prison since 
last year 
seven of their allies were taken into custody saturday informed 
sources said but it is not clear whether charges will be filed 
against them 
castro says scuttling the system he has built could nullify the 
advances in health and education that the revolution has brought 
about about in three decades 
but judging the number of cubans who agree with him is almost 
impossible 
his more fervent backers insist that support for the government 
exceeds 80 percent and perhaps 90 percent 
others who find the system has both virtues and flaws believe 
the support level is between 50 percent and 60 percent desperate 
cubans who have fled the island recently for miami on rafts the 
average is about 40 per month put the figure at closer to 10 
percent 
that estimate seems far lower than castro deserves there is 
little doubt he has the allegiance of a higher percentage of his 
people than any of the east european leaders who bowed out under 
public pressure last year 
still the mood here is uncertain and nervous as cuba suddenly 
finds itself almost without allies 
at the international level cubans wonder if the united states 
fresh from its ouster of panamas manuel antonio noriega will 
target cuba next 
cuba is so wellprepared for that eventuality castro has said 
that invading us soldiers would spill rivers of blood 
on the economic front castro is openly questioning whether the 
soviet union will be able to survive the wave of nationalist 
uprisings 
if not cuba could face among other problems the challenge of 
finding an alternate supply of oil the soviets provide cuba with 
12 million tons of oil annually at preferential rates 
castro warned his countrymen last week that massive 
energysaving measures will have to be instituted if oil supplies 
are sharply reduced 
mules may have to replace tractors on the farm in havana bus 
service may have to be curtailed by onethird he said the 
manufacture of clothing may be limited exclusively for children 
castro confided to a visitor recently that he hasnt had a day 
off in months because mf his accumulating troubles but he also 
seems to relish the new challenges 
he said last week that cubans are fortunate to be part of a 
struggle against the giant counterrevolutionary tide that 
threatens to engulf the world 
it is a privilege for our country to have to face these 
responsibilities he said

maj gen herard abraham who took over from avril is to transfer 
power to a civilian

critic of the military government said residents should remain 
alert to the possibility of army reprisals 
we can smile but we cant laugh yet aristide said on radio

heard occasionally 
im afraid for my husband and i fear the macoutes will come 
out of the walls said the wife of a wellknown politician 
speaking on condition of anonymity the tonton macoutes were the 
feared secret police of the duvalier family which ruled haiti for 
29 years 
numbering about 30000 the macoutes were disbanded after 
jeanclaude duvalier fled to exile in france in february 1986 
later several hundred were integrated into the army and police as 
special agents

soldiers who professed disdain for political killings and other 
abuses by the previous military ruler lt gen henri namphy 
namphy had ruled the country among the poorest in the 
hemisphere for most of the 2 years since the popular uprising 
that ousted jeaneclaude duvalier 
this caribbean nation of 6 million people has been ruled mainly 
by the military since it gained independence from france in 1804 
and opposition leaders said they did not trust avril to oversee 
presidential elections he promised for the fall in a january 
crackdown the government jailed and beat dozens of dissidents 
exiling seven 
protests against avril broke out one week ago after a soldier 
killed an 11yearold girl apparently by accident 
avril agreed to step down after negotiations reportedly 
involving the us and french embassies the roman catholic church 
and opposition political parties 
in haitis last attempt at elections overseen by namphy in 
november 1987 voting was canceled after thugs backed by soldiers 
killed at least 34 voters

soviet troops boarded trains and 
headed for home monday the first to leave hungary as part of an 
agreement to remove all red army soldiers from the country by june 
30 1991 
a military band played the soviet and the hungarian national 
anthems as the first contingent of 300 troops and 37 combat 
infantry vehicles pulled out moscow has 49700 troops in hungary 
the withdrawal began just two weeks after the kremlin began 
bringing home troops from neighboring czechoslovakia where a 
similar agreement was reached last month on the removal of all 
73500 soviet soldiers there 
moscow has committed itself to remove the last of its troops and 
equipment from both countries by june 30 1991 
not many hungarians turned out in this tiny village station to 
see off the red army soldiers 
i am just glad to see them go said miklos szilasi an 
elderly resident i saw them come and ill really believe it only 
when the last one leaves 
soviet troops have been in hungary since the end of world war 
ii they are mainly associated with the bloody crushing of the 1956 
uprising for more democracy and a multiparty system 
moscow agreed to withdraw its troops in the initial days of the 
revolt but instead of departing reinforcements poured in to crush 
the uprising 
the start of the withdrawal comes just two weeks before 
hungarians go to the polls march 25 for the first free multiparty 
elections since the communists consolidated power in 1948 
some opposition leaders have said the new government might try 
to renegotiate the withdrawal agreement with moscow to move forward 
the completion date 
as the troops boarded the trains and combat vehicles were 
fastened to flatbed rail cars activists from the opposition league 
of young democrats held up banners reading hurry home sunny 
azerbaijan awaits you a sarcastic reference to kremlins 
dispatching soldiers to quell ethnic strife in the soviet caucasus 
they should leave as fast as they came in said zsuzsa 
szelenyi 
the withdrawal agreement was signed in moscow on saturday by 
soviet foreign minister eduard shevardnadze and his hungarian 
counterpart gyula horn 
i think that the overwhelming majority of our people wanted to 
see this agreement said ferenc somogyi the no 2 in the foreign 
ministry who negotiated the agreement and who came to this town 75 
miles southwest of budapest to see the first troops off 
addressing the oppositions concern that the withdrawal be 
accelerated somogyi said we considered it of crucial importance 
to get the pullout under way without delay i do not exclude the 
possibility of shortening the deadline but we think it is a tight 
one 
he noted the agreement stipulates that the withdrawal must be 
completed before june 30 1991 
maj gen viktor shilov first deputy to the commanderinchief 
of the southern group of forces stationed in hungary said the 
pullouts will now be a daily event from various parts of hungary 
by the end of this year 70 percent of the combat forces will be 
withdrawn 
somogyi said the soviet evaluation of 1956 is still to come 
hungary would like to see an admission by moscow concerning its 
role in 1956 similar to the apology extended to prague for the 1968 
sovietled warsaw pact invasion that crushed reforms there 
shilov noted it is good to be a guest but it is even better 
to go home 
some guests 45 years said an old peasant under his breath

us officials helped convince lt gen 
prosper avril to yield power without a fight in haiti and president 
bush ordered an evacuation flight for the exruler because he felt 
some obligation to the general the white house said today 
avril and his family were airlifted by c141 transport jet this 
morning to homestead air force base 25 miles outside miami 
marlin fitzwater the white house spokesman said we are 
hopeful for a smooth transition to democracy in haiti and are 
encouraging that effort 
he refused to say whether the united states has granted avril 
asylum 
he did meet with out ambassador over the weekend and did 
request that we provide transportation the united states president 
bush agreed and sent a c141 to pick him up said fitzwater 
asked if the us ambassador alvin p adams had talked avril 
into stepping down fitzwater said we had discussions with him 
about a transition and one of the reasons we offered him 
transportation to the united states was a feeling of some 
obligation to help him leave power and facilitate a peaceful 
transition 
we were helpful in facilitating his departure said 
fitzwater 
an air force spokesman in washington lt col darrell hayes 
said avril was being driven to boca raton fla after which he was 
on his own 
fitzwater said avril has a temporary sanctuary here but 
we dont know what his long term plans are 
fitzwater said avril has indicated he wants to stay in the miami 
area a few days his plans beyond that are unknown were still 
talking to him about that he said 
we arent prepared to discuss mr avrils future at this 
point said fitzwater 
the united states also provided an air force jet in february 
1986 to evacuate jeanclaude baby doc duvalier to france 
ending 29 years of dictatorships under duvalier and his father 
francois papa doc duvalier the father died in 1971 after 14 
years of iron fist rule 
fitzwater said the united states had not placed any 
conditions on the new government that is to be set up in haiti 
the haitians are scheduled to vote in local elections in april and 
in presidential elections in october and november 
with avril gone power rested in the hands of maj gen herard 
abraham the army chief of staff who was to name a provisional 
president by tuesday 
the united states currently is providing 414 million in 
humanitarian and development assistance to haiti through private 
voluntary and nongovernmental agency 
it cut off direct assistance to the government of haiti 
following an election massacre in november 1987 but did provide 
10 million in emergency food assistance last year 
we have said in the past that any other resumption of 
assistance to the haitian government will be contingent upon 
tangible evidence of progress and a transition to democracy and to 
respect for human rights said fitzwater 
we are consulting with other interested governments in the 
area on the process of transition he said

sir eric gairy the eccentric 
former prime minister deposed in a leftist coup 11 years ago is 
attempting a comeback in grenadas second general election since 
the usled invasion of 1983 
gairy who dominated the tiny caribbean islands politics for 
three decades before his ouster faces competition from three 
moderates and one leftist in what could be a close vote tuesday 
we are right down to the wire but it is not clear who is in 
the lead said michael minors president of the grenada chamber 
of commerce 
the election falls on the 11th anniversary of the leftist coup 
that ousted gairys authoritarian regime and brought the peoples 
revolutionary government of the late prime minister maurice bishop 
to power 
an ideological rift within bishops government led to his 
assassination along with 10 other people on oct 19 1983 six 
days later us troops accompanied by a small regional force 
invaded the island and ousted a marxist junta that had seized power 
herbert blaize a staunch us ally won the first election 
after the invasion in 1984 he died in december at the age of 71 
gairy 68 is nearly blind with glaucoma and had said that he 
would not contest the election unless a miracle improved his 
sight 
but at a recent news conference he declared that a source 
which is greater than i ordained that he lead grenada once again 
despite his failing sight he asserted that it was no coincidence 
the election was being held on the anniversary of his ouster 
no man on earth could have arranged this he said it had 
to be arranged cosmically by a divine force 
gairy who was grenadas first prime minister after independence 
from britain in 1974 has been dogged throughout his career by 
allegations of corruption and repression 
his interest in the occult has made him an occasional object of 
ridicule he was deposed on march 13 1979 while in new york 
trying to persuade the united nations to investigate flying saucers 
but gairy maintains strong support among farm workers he 
founded grenadas first trade union the urban poor and the 
elderly his followers call him uncle gairy and voters are 
largely divided between pro and antigairy forces rather than 
along party lines 
since the invasion the united states has pumped more than 110 
million into grenada a nation of 94000 people but a widely 
expected bonanza of foreign investment has never occurred the 
campaign however has focused more on personalities than economic 
issues 
the other main contenders for prime minister are all regarded as 
moderates they are prime minister ben jones 66 a former foreign 
minister appointed as blaizes replacement pending the election 
keith mitchell 44 a useducated statistician who was fired by 
blaize as public works minister in a personality and policy 
dispute and nicholas brathwaite 65 who led an interim government 
after the us invasion 
a fifth candidate dr terrence marryshow 37 a cubantrained 
doctor and leader of the leftist maurice bishop patriotic movement 
is considered to have virtually no chance of winning 
no voter opinion polls have been published but most grenadians 
expect a close election some believe no single party will win a 
majority of the 15 seats in the house of representatives grenadas 
parliament which could result in a coalition government

doctors on monday claimed initial success for an 
operation in which a man whose foot was severed by a subway train 
had it grafted onto his forearm 
a team of 10 doctors headed by dr maurice mimoun of the hopital 
rothschild worked more than six hours thursday to save the 
40yearold accident victims leg and foot 
the patient who was not identified fell onto the subway tracks 
just as the train was pulling into the station the wheels mangled 
his lower right leg and cleanly cut off the foot 
paramedics arrived within minutes and stabilized the victim who 
was bleeding heavily and going into shock other rescue workers 
found the severed foot on the track and whisked it to the hospital 
along with the man 
there i was confronted with a foot in perfect condition and a 
stump that needed several weeks to heal before the foot could be 
sewn back on mimoun said 
i had to think of a way to preserve the foot for as long as 
possible he said in an interview but i had never thought of 
doing this before 
if the legs heals properly it could take as little as three 
weeks or as long as three months mimoun said he will reattach the 
foot to the stump 
the patient should be able to walk normally without the 
temporary graft amputation would have been necessary he said 
the leg may be a little bit shorter he added but there are many 
ways to compensate and prevent a significant limp 
mimoun said the patient was under sedation and did not know he 
had undergone the surgery which was authorized by the victims 
family 
the results of the surgery were shown on french tv sunday night 
the swollen bloodstained foot resting in a prayer position over 
the hand which was uninjured 
mimoun said the use of relay grafts is common practice among 
plastic surgeons who often try to save healthy muscle or skin 
tissue by grafting it onto the forearm 
the forearm is used because it has two major blood vessels 
one of which can be used to vascularize whatever needs to be 
saved mimoun said he said the arm would supply the grafted foot 
with enough blood to keep it alive 
mimoun said the relay graft was a success thus far and gave the 
credit to being able to assemble a trauma team in 15 minutes he 
said some of the patients swelling had already gone down and there 
was no sign of infection 
its still too early to cry victory but im optimistic 
mimoun said

the 1990 michelin guide book on monday awarded 
three stars to alain ducasse chef at the louis xv restaurant in 
montecarlos hotel de paris making him the youngest person ever 
to be so honored 
but the gourmets bible demoted loustau de baumaniere a famous 
restaurant in les baux in southern france to two stars after 35 
years as a threestar restaurant 
michelins famous red guide which goes on sale wednesday thus 
retained only 19 restaurants in the threestar category the 
bestselling guidebook which last year sold more than 750000 
copies can make or break a restaurants reputation 
ducasse 33 was jubilant at his three stars 
i think michelin is now starting to honor the younger 
generation as the hope of french cuisine he said in an interview 
the son of a farmer in southwest france ducasse said i grew 
up with the gardengrown vegetables with rabbits and chickens and 
my golden rule is to use the best of fresh ingredients 
ducasse learned his trade with several giants of french 
gastronomy starting at age 16 as an apprentice at the pavillon 
landais in soustons in southwestern france 
he then moved on to apprentice with michel guerard assisting in 
writing the famous lowfat cookbook cuisine minceur while at 
guerards threestar restaurant in eugenielesbains 
he also worked with such gastronomic luminaries as gaston 
lenotre in his pastry factory outside paris roger verge at his 
threestar moulin de mougins near cannes and alain chapel in 
mionnay near lyons 
in 1979 he returned to mougins as chef for verges less 
expensive annex lamandier and from 198186 was chef at the juana 
hotel in juanlespins 
in 1987 he was chosen personally by prince rainier of monaco as 
chef for the renovated belle epoquestyle louis xv restaurant at 
the hotel de paris 
the prince wanted this to be a worldclass restaurant 
ducasse said the louis xv is the only hotel restaurant to garner 
three stars in the history of the guide which started in 1900 
michelin also awarded a first star to the hotels rooftop grill 
room 
under ducasse the louis xv won its first star in 1987 and its 
second in 1988 before the 1990 accolade that made it worth a 
detour in the guidebooks parlance 
this is a spectacular rise as the guidebook is circumspect in 
its choices anonymous inspectors visit a restaurant several times 
for months or years before handing out the little stars that 
actually look like rosettes 
six restaurants were demoted from two stars to one including 
paris precatalan in the bois de boulogne and le petit bedon and 
57 restaurants fell from one star to none these include some 
wellknown paris eateries such as lamazere gildo le bistrot de 
paris and laquitaine 
the reason that baumaniere lost its third star is mainly that 
its going through a transitional period according to alain 
arnaud a spokesman for michelin arnaud said the former chef 
raymond thuilier has handed over the reins to his grandson and 
for michelin the results are still tentative 
meanwhile ducasse was busy in the monegasque kitchens turning 
out his famous delicacies that include a risotto with white italian 
truffles little vegetables sauteed with fresh black truffles 
warm seafood salad and giant pasta made with parsley to look like 
a mosaic 
of course im near italy and their cuisine influences me 
said ducasse im aiming to produce flavors of the sun in my 
food a mediterranean style based on its wonderful seafood 
vegetables olive oil 
just back from a tour of japan where he created a new menu for 
the okura hotel restaurant in tokyo ducasse said he was impressed 
by the freshness of japanese cuisine 
americans too have marvelous produce he said but the 
average american seems to consume too much sugar and starch making 
for less healthy and more fattening cuisine than japanese 
although the red guide will be snapped up for its restaurant 
recommendations it is still basically a guide for drivers giving 
exhaustive information about hotels distances between towns 
garages and auto dealers

military personnel who helped finance the 
construction of bases now slated for closing will be losing the 
400 million they invested in commissaries and base exchanges two 
congressmen said monday 
in effect military people paid 5 percent higher prices to 
finance construction of facilities such as pxs commissaries and 
recreation buildings rep marvin leath dtexas said in a 
statement they donated these facilities to the governments 
inventory upon completion 
joining leath in the criticism was rep david ob martin rny 
the commission on base realignment and closure recommended in 
december 1988 closing 86 domestic bases partly closing five others 
and changing the mission of 54 other installations for an estimated 
savings of 694 million a year and a 20year savings estimated at 
56 billion 
former defense secretary frank c carlucci approved the 
recommendations and congress despite some complaints last year 
overwhelmingly supported the commissions decision 
earlier this year defense secretary dick cheney recommended 
closing or scaling back more than 72 domestic facilities and 14 
overseas installations members of congress including rep les 
aspin dwis chairman of the house armed services committee have 
criticized cheneys list as partisan 
leath and martin said that based on their calculations closing 
the 86 bases as well as the domestic installations cheney has 
recommended would cost us personnel about 240 million if 
overseas bases were included the cost would be approximately 400 
million 
base closures are being billed as a step to reduce costs to

a red oak tree a few miles down the road 
from terry a andersons hometown was just a sapling when monica 
stocum tied a yellow ribbon around it soon after he was abducted in 
lebanon on march 16 1985 
now the tree has grown enough to burst the ribbon engulfing 
parts of it in the trees new growth the onetime sapling will 
soon be big enough to shelter a picnic 
my god a tree grows slowly and look at how it has grown 
stocum said 
anderson is still a hostage held captive longer than any other 
westerner in lebanon but in this town of about 17000 people 
stocum and hundreds like her are keeping his memory alive even 
though they have never met him 
an informal group organizes ceremonies to commemorate andersons 
birthdays and the anniversaries of his kidnapping on friday the 
fifth anniversary of his abduction from the streets of beirut they 
will attend services and fast for 24 hours as a gesture of 
spirituality and support 
hometown solidarity and admiration for the efforts of andersons 
sister peggy say to free all the western hostages in lebanon have 
spurred those efforts said anne zickl a member of the group 
terry anderson graduated from batavia high school so did my 
mother and father and i so did my four kids so you have a 
connection right there said mrs zickl plus i think 
americans dont like injustice 
stocum moved to nearby le roy 15 years after anderson left the 
area but said the hometown tie was important to her as well 
i probably wouldnt know him if i fell over him in the street 
even with the pictures she said it just seems like we should 
be more alert because hes one of us 
anderson left batavia in dairy country 40 miles east of 
buffalo in 1965 to join the marines he went on to a career in 
journalism that took him as chief middle east correspondent for 
the associated press to lebanon 
his father glenn r anderson and brother glenn richard jr 
remained here and after terry was kidnapped say moved back to be 
with them said penny anderson a sisterinlaw the father and 
brother have since died 
she was always the strong one of the family mrs anderson 
said 
since then say has been the most persistent and outspoken 
advocate of her brothers cause her efforts drew admiration and 
offers of help locally from longtime friends like marsha barton 
and strangers such as mrs zickl 
they now form a support team for say who has moved to kentucky 
but continues to travel the world to press for her brothers 
freedom 
working from mrs zickls dining room her family has not eaten 
there in 1 years they publish newsletters collect valentines 
day and christmas cards for anderson and field inquiries from 
reporters from around the world 
we just function here to give peggy as much support as we can 
because peggy is the one who can do the most for the hostages 
mrs zickl said 
there have been more than enough dashed hopes and as they plan 
for the fifth anniversary of andersons capture they find 
themselves trying to stifle excitement over irans recently 
softened stance on the hostage issue 
my head is saying now dont get excited weve heard all 
this before mrs anderson said my heart says hes coming 
home i woke up monday morning absolutely positive hes coming 
home 
fridays fast they hope will give the kidnappers one more 
nudge toward that goal 
i think that people in other countries find americans very 
arrogant and very selfindulgent mrs zickl said for them to 
know that americans are fasting not on their own behalf but for 
peace and freedom in the middle east i think theyll find that 
very moving

the iranian mentor of shiite moslem 
kidnappers in lebanon says some of the western captives are spies 
and none of the mercenary us hostages should be freed 
in a signed editorial published saturday in the tehran newspaper 
kayhan and received monday by the associated press in nicosia ali 
akbar mohtashemi said the sentence for espionage in an islamic 
country is death 
mohtashemi attacked those who suggest iran help free the 
hostages the former interior minister leads the powerful radical 
faction which opposes president hashemi rafsanjanis policy of 
improving relations with the west 
the islamic republic of iran cannot and should not impose its 
policies and views on other moslem nations mohtashemi wrote in 
the persianlanguage newspaper an apparent reference to lebanon 
and the hostageholders 
furthermore freedom for the hostages means breaking the 
chains of bloodthirsty wolves the sentence for a spy in an islamic 
country is death eight americans four britons two west 
germans two swiss an irishman and an italian are missing in 
lebanon and believed to be hostages 
held longest is terry a anderson 42 chief middle east 
correspondent of the associated press who this week will mark five 
years in captivity he was abducted march 16 1985 
mohtashemis editorial conflicted with rafsanjanis indications 
last week that the hostages might be freed it was not carried by 
the official islamic republic news agency which regularly excerpts 
important articles from iranian papers 
rafsanjani who seeks western investment and technology to 
revive irans sluggish economy told a news conference march 7 the 
hostage issue was moving toward a solution 
alqabas a kuwaiti newspaper said in a dispatch monday from 
syria that iranian radicals wanted guarantees hezbollah the 
umbrella group for most groups holding hostages would not be 
disbanded after the captives were freed 
the hardline groups in iran which possess the key card in the 
file of the western hostages held in lebanon have asked president 
hashemi rafsanjani for concrete guarantees about the future of 
hezbollah party in lebanon as one of the conditions for the release 
of the captives the paper said 
mohtashemi said calls for hostage releases in the tehran times 
a paper allied with rafsanjani and by mohammed hussein fadlallah 
spiritual leader of hezbollah had created a new climate inside 
the country and abroad that heightened the pressure on the 
islamic revolution and the moslems of lebanon 
instead of putting pressure on the wronged lebanese moslems to 
release the mercenary us hostages world public opinion should 
look for the center of hostagetaking at the white house and among 
western and american intelligence services mohtashemi said 
he said some hostages were spies for the cia and named terry 
waite special envoy of the archbishop of canterbury who 
disappeared in west beirut in january 1987 after leaving his hotel 
to negotiate with hostageholders the church has denied such 
charges 
according to mohtashemi who helped found hezbollah in 1983 
while ambassador to syria said recent publicity in the west about 
the hostages does not mean the west and the us want a solution 
to the hostage problem but is a tactic to confront islam 
those holding the hostages should not be condemned he said 
because the west and the us have turned the third world and 
islamic countries especially lebanon and palestine into big 
prisons when prisoners carry out reprisals and take a few of their 
jailers hostage for some period of time to achieve their just 
rights colonialist networks raise a hue and cry 
mohtashemi denied iran was involved in hostage taking 
the islamic republic of iran has not been involved in any 
stages of hostage taking in lebanon and the moslem lebanese forces 
have been and are operating on their own he said in the 
editorial 
rafsanjani excluded mohtashemi when he formed his cabinet in 
august four months later the former interior minister won an 
important tehran seat in the 270member parliament which is 
dominated by radicals 
the kuwait newspaper said the united states was urging syria to 
crack down on hezbollah by moving its forces into the shiite slums 
of south beirut where most of the hostages are believed held 
syria an ally of iran has 40000 soldiers in lebanon but has 
kept them out of the shiite slums the soldiers are there under a 
peackeeping mandate issued by the arab league in 1976 the year 
after lebanons civil war began

oliver l north scolded by the judge for 
quibbling on the witness stand testified monday that john m 
poindexter instructed him to withhold from congress key details of 
the irancontra affair 
testifying at poindexters irancontra coverup trial the former 
national security council aide also said that his onetime boss 
approved the diversion of usiran armssale profits to buy 
weapons for the nicaraguan contras 
you got the full permission and authority to do that from 
admiral poindexter prosecutor dan webb said of the diversion 
yes north said 
before you did it you cleared each one of these 
transactions with admiral poindexter before they occurred webb 
asked 
yes said the retired marine lieutenant colonel 
asked if he remembered poindexter saying that the diversion 
should never ever be revealed north replied he did not 
recall the specific direction but i do remember the general 
admonition 
poindexter a retired navy rear admiral who was president 
reagans national security adviser in 1986 is accused of 
obstructing congressional inquiries into the irancontra affair 
making false statements and destroying key documents 
north looked away without replying when webb said good 
morning col north he was rebuked several times by us 
district judge harold greene for quibbles with the prosecutor 
over minor details or for repeatedly failing to remember 
significant ones 
almost every time a question is asked he says he cant 
recall the judge complained its like pulling teeth 
later greene directed north not to try to embroider his 
answer with explanations that only made his responses less clear 
just answer the question he told north who was declared a 
hostile witness at the outset of his testimony last friday 
lets try to stick to the facts greene said yes your 
honor north replied 
north conceded that when he met aug 6 1986 with congressmen 
inquiring about news reports concerning covert assistance to the 
nicaraguan rebels he was following general instructions from 
poindexter to conceal the operation 
webb pursued the line of questioning to try to dispel norths 
insistence on friday that nobody told me to lie to congress 
the prosecutor asked north if he knew that poindexter had 
generally instructed you to conceal both the contra assistance 
operation and the diversion of profits from the stillsecret 
usiran arms sales 
yes but it was to conceal it or withhold that information 
from anybody north replied 
you knew he had generally instructed you to conceal facts from 
congress webb asked 
its inclusive in that yes north replied only after webb 
produced a transcript of the former white house aides sworn 
acknowledgement to congress of receiving poindexters instructions 
you knew that you were denying important facts that congress 
needed to make decisions webb said 
i didnt recall thinking about it north said 
the prosecutor showed north the testimony he gave congress in 
1987 when the former white house aide admitted that he had 
concealed important information from lawmakers 
thats how i answered the question north said 
poindexter is charged with conspiracy obstruction of congress 
and making false statements to lawmakers to conceal the secret 
contra resupply operation set up after congress banned us 
military aid to the rebels 
the indictment accuses poindexter of destroying documents and 
lying to hide white house knowledge of a november 1985 shipment of 
18 hawk antiaircraft missiles to iran 
north was convicted last year of aiding and abetting an 
obstruction of congress as well as destruction or alteration of key 
irancontra documents

the foreign ministry on monday denied a claim 
by lebanese villagers that israel plans to build a settlement in 
its selfdeclared security zone in south lebanon 
villagers in south lebanon petitioned their government monday to 
prevent an american from establishing what they said would be the 
first israeli settlement on lebanese soil 
but deputy israeli foreign ministry spokesman baruch bina said 
the story is totally untrue it is nonsense 
a statement by the lebanese government said the petition was 
made by representatives of rashaya foukhar a town of 5000 people 
in the security zone it was addressed to president elias hrawi 
prime minister salim hoss and parliament speaker hussein husseni 
the petition said william robinson who it described as a 
jewishamerican immigrant moved to settle in the towns school 
after israels 1982 invasion and gradually brought in relatives and 
israeli acquaintances 
but an official with a fundamentalist christian organization in 
israel said robinson was an evangelical christian who with his 
family has been trying to help orphans and handicapped children 
the lebanese petition said robinson seized the pine forests 
near rashaya foukhar and recently brought in israeli engineers to 
build houses for 100 families to live outside the town 
it said most of these families would be jews who emigrated to 
israel from the united states and ethiopia in the last two years 
we appeal to you to move quickly to block the establishment of 
the first zionist settlement on lebanese territory the petition 
added 
it accused the command of a norwegian battalion serving with the 
un peacekeeping force in south lebanon of collaborating with 
robinson but gave no details 
timur goksel spokesman for the un peacekeepers described the 
incident as a local quarrel he said the forces only contact with 
the robinson family was that our soldiers during christmas gave 
gifts to the five children at the school 
rashaya foukhar in the foothills of mount hermon is eight 
miles northeast of the israeli border and part of a 6 to 
10milewide buffer strip patrolled by israeli troops and the 
israelibacked south lebanon army militia the zone was established 
in 1985 when israel withdrew the bulk of its invasion force from 
south lebanon ending a threeyear occupation

threetime winner susan butcher and 
defending champion joe runyan their dog teams well rested gained 
on iditarod trail sled dog race leader lavon barve today as they 
pulled into this checkpoint on norton sound 
resting his dogs only 3 hours barve was about four hours ahead 
of butcher and runyan when they left kaltag the last checkpoint on 
the yukon river for the 90mile run to unalakleet the gateway to 
the bering sea 
butcher with eight hours rest and runyan with five were both 
less than two hours behind barve when they hit unalakleet where 
racers were expected to rest about six hours before heading up the 
coast for the last 170 miles to nome 
leaving kaltag behind runyan were tim osmar fourtime champion 
rick swenson deedee jonrowe and robin jackobson of squaw lake

in the last 170mile sprint to nome 
if you want to make a good bet never bet on a dog race he 
said its really shaken out which team is healthy and really 
fit looks to me like its anybodys bet whats going on here 
before leaving kaltag runyan said the leaders in the 18th 
running of the 1158mile race had come under the spell of what he 
called the crazy syndrome 
everybodys pushing pushing pushing runyan said 
runyan called his dogs little biomechanisms that have to be 
understood cared for and appreciated the trick is to be 
predictable for the dogs said runyan 
because of his habit of running behind his sled rather than 
riding its rails when it heads up hills kaltag area residents have 
begun calling him runnin runyan

from anchorage to nome just because she had been first to reach 
kaltag she said everybody was running their own race with

sponsors of the annual cherry blossom festival 
on monday expressed optimism that unseasonably warm weather hitting 
the nations capital will not cause the trees to bloom too early 
for the celebration 
even though the weather forecasts are good drat it and the 
cherry blossoms look like they may come out early were still 
hopeful national park service spokesman al dale said 
april 1 is the scheduled start of the 78th annual festival 
commemorating the gift of the 3000 trees to the united states by 
the mayor of tokyo in 1912 temperatures ranging from the mid 60s 
to the upper 80s are expected for the rest of the week 
the earliest the trees have ever blossomed was march 20 but 
forecasters say it could be even earlier this year the delicate 
pink and white blossoms last four to five days after they peak 
if things go according to our estimates by april 1 the 
program may just be the japanese tree festival because the 
blossoms will have come and gone national weather service 
meteorologist jim belleville said 
about 1300 of the trees ring the tidal basin between the 
lincoln and jefferson memorials with the rest planted on nearby 
park land 
forecasters said there was still hope that the cooling effect of 
the nearby potomac river could slow down blossom development 
temperatures near water are always lower than those farther away 
from water belleville said 
but he said any slowdown caused by the potomac waters would be 
shortlived 
national park service spokesman earle kittleman said that if the 
blossoms of the yoshino or singleblossom trees make an early 
debut all would not be lost because there were at least 400 
doubleflowering or kwanzan trees that would bloom later than the 
yoshino trees

black factional fighting and 
other confrontations between activists and authorities have killed 
20 blacks and wounded six police officials said monday 
zulu leader mangosothu buthelezi whose supporters have been 
involved in some of the worst fighting said he favors turning 
south africa into a federation of states to take into account 
ethnic differences buthelezi said in an interview that he opposes 
any plans to nationalize the economy 
the antiapartheid united democractic front said 89 activists 
were detained without charge last week under state of emergency 
regulations only a handful of people had been in detention until 
the widespread violence erupted last month 
thirteen people were killed in unrest this weekend in 
buthelezis kwazulu homeland in the southeast police said the 
dead included a woman and her four children who burned to death 
when their hut was set on fire police gave no additional details 
police said monday they found the bodies of three black men who 
were stoned and burned in the kwaguqa township east of johannesburg 
also three blacks were killed sunday in fighting between rival 
factions in black townships in various parts of the country and a 
fourth man was killed by police gunfire 
in cape town about 50 people peacefully protesting rising food 
prices were arrested witnesses said the march was organized by 
the national unemployed workers coordinating committee 
a police statement reported unrest in various areas with police 
patrols using shotguns pistols rubber bullets and tear gas to 
disperse crowds to halt faction fighting 
south africa has been hit by a wave of violence seen as the most 
serious unrest since the mid1980s more than 200 people have been 
killed in unrest in the past four weeks in fighting over issues 
ranging from tribal rivalry to struggles between gangs for control 
of various townships 
some of the worst fighting was in the black township of 
katlehong outside johannesburg where at least 24 people have been 
killed during the past week in clashes that began in a struggle 
between rival taxi companies 
about 1000 men went on a rampage in the area sunday night 
chasing people from their homes after a hostel was firebombed 
according to the south african press association police reported 
several vehciles and buildings were burned and at least one man 
suffered serious stab wounds 
residents of some townships have called for deployment of army 
troops to halt factional fighing although removal of troops from 
black townships has been a standing demand of antiapartheid 
organizations since a national state of emergency was declared june 
12 1986 
in an interview with the south african press association 
buthelezi said he was willing to consider the african national 
congress plan for full democracy with no racial barriers in south 
africa but the leader of the zulu inkatha political movement said 
he still prefers his previously stated plan for dividing the 
country into separate ethnicbased entities to avoid racial 
friction 
one cannot ignore the multinational character of south 
africa he was quoted as saying 
i believe a federation of states would accommodate all 
interests however i am not locked into this idea to the extent 
that i am not prepared to explode the ancs idea of a unitary 
state he added 
inkatha is a major political movement representing south 
africas large zulu tribe it opposes apartheid but is more 
conservative than the anc and some other black nationalist groups 
buthelezi said he was totally opposed to any plans to end south 
africas free market economy he said black african states that 
adopted socialist economic systems experienced major problems and 
were not switching back to free enterprise 
but the anc which favors nationalizing key sectors of the 
economy had studiously ignored the experience of other african 
states he said

the bush administration said monday it is 
willing to deal with lithuania as an independent state if it can 
negotiate a full transfer of power from the soviet union and take 
charge of its own destiny 
weaving a delicate balance betweeen the national aspirations of 
the lithuanian people and the shaky political posture of soviet 
president mikhail s gorbachev administration officials stopped 
short of official recognition of lithuanias new move toward 
independent government 
we believe this is the right measure of support said white 
house spokesman marlin fitzwater it reflects our policy of many 
years of not recognizing their incorporation into the soviet 
union in the first place 
fitzwater and margaret tutwiler spokeswoman for the state 
department made clear that lithuanias declaration of independence 
is only a first step there is much to be done before the baltic 
state becomes independent in fact and formal us ties are 
established they said 
ms tutwiler said however that prompted by the unanimous 
declaration of independence voted sunday by the lithuanian 
parliament the united states will expand the range of our 
contacts with freely elected representatives and officials of the 
baltic states as appropriate 
but she and fitzwater also made clear that does not yet extend 
to an exchange of ambassadors or the extension of full diplomatic 
recognitiion 
the administrations policy fitzwater said reflects the fact 
that they still have negotiations to carry out that we want to be 
successful but we arent going to try to dictate the eventual 
outcome 
fitzwater said we would want any recognition to take into 
account a final government that was in control of their own 
destiny and much of that has yet to be negotiated with the soviet 
union 
the united states recognized the independence of a lithuanian 
state in 1922 it has never recognized its forced incorporation 
into the soviet union in 1940 
nonetheless ms tutwiler said that over the years it has been 
us practice to establish formal relations with the lawful 
government of any state once that government is in effective 
control of its territory and capable of entering into and 
fulfilling international obligations 
when we are satisfied that the lithuanian government can meet 
these requirements we will establish formal diplomatic relations 
with the new government she said 
she said such questions as the removal of some 200000 soviet 
troops from lithuanian soil is a matter for negotiations between 
the soviets and representatives of lithuania 
and ms tutwiler said she would not spell out precisely what 
specific steps would have to be taken before the united states 
would recognize lithuanias full sovereignty 
gorbachev opening a congress of communist party deputies in 
moscow on monday called lithuanias declaration of independence 
alarming 
but he gave no sign that action will be taken to prevent 
lithuania and the other baltic republics from seceding 
gorbachev had previously placed a 34 billion pricetag on 
lithuanian independence saying an independent lithuania would have 
to pay for the factories roads and other physical improvements 
made during a halfcentury of soviet rule 
but lithuanians say they have a much larger bill to present for 
five decades of soviet repression including mass deportations to 
siberia under joseph stalin

britains foreign secretary said 
monday that protecting nato is his main concern as german 
unification proceeds but there also will be tough discussions 
on how to incorporate what is now east germany into the eec 
foreign secretary douglas hurd made the remarks two days before 
the preliminary round of the twoplusfour unification talks of 
the two german nations and the four world war ii allies the 
united states the soviet union france and britain 
hurd was in bonn for discussions with chancellor helmut kohl 
about his game plan for unification he also met with foreign 
minister hansdietrich genscher 
the west german government announced meanwhile that kohl would 
be meeting with british prime minister margaret thatcher on march 
30 
hurd said that in his talks with kohl and genscher they 
discussed virtually every aspect of german unification 
including the polish border issue nato and the european economic 
community 
mr genscher assured me it is the wish of the federal 
government that these external aspects should be settled there 
should be agreement on them before unification takes place 
said hurd 
he praised kohls reversal of his earlier refusal to say 
unequivocally that a united germany would have no designs on land 
ceded to poland after the third reichs defeat in 1945 he also 
insisted the poles have a right to participate in discussions about 
their borders 
poland is demanding it be included in the reunification talks 
but west germany has rejected that idea 
certainly the poles should take part in any discussion which 
affects their frontiers hurd said without specifying if he 
believes poland should be a full participant in the talks 
hurd underscored that britain supports german unification and 
said london merely has been insisting that the external aspects

hauling corp whose investigators were joined by federal and state 
inspectors monday authorities said the three killed were working

us subsidies on wheat sold to the soviet 
union were worth 481 million over 29 months the general 
accounting office reported 
the soviet union got the benefit of lower prices from the 
largest amount that the us government spent on shipments to any 
one country the subsidies are collected by us exporting 
companies which then ship to foreign buyers at less than market 
prices 
the object is to help sell us farm products in competition 
with subsidies by governments of other producer countries trying to 
help their own farmers the program is aimed especially at 
competition from the 12 countries of the european economic 
community where france and west germany are big exporters of wheat 
wheat is the major item under what the federal government calls 
its export enhancement program but subsidies are also paid on a 
variety of products from eggs to milk cows 
detailed figures in the report made available recently cover 
oct 1 1986 through feb 28 1989 during that period the total 
subsidies to all exporters amounted to 23 billion total sales of 
us products helped by the subsidies were 68 billion of which 
55 billion was for sales of wheat 
five countries were the biggest wheat buyers under the program 
the soviet union china algeria egypt and morocco 
critics say the subsidized sales discourage those governments 
from paying better prices to their own farmers and that the bread 
from the wheat is so cheap that some feed it to animals 
the agriculture department put the total cost of the subsidies 
up to last week at 27 billion since the program began in 1985 it 
said later detailed figures for the soviet union and other 
individual countries were confidential 
its largely a passthrough operation to help us farmers 
said rob johnson vice president for public affairs of cargill inc 
our commissions have averaged less than onehalf of one percent 
of sales 
cargill one of the worlds biggest grain dealers collected the 
largest amount in subsidies 4449 million 
how much of that was profit is impossible to estimate said 
allen i mendelowitz director of international trade and finance 
issues at the gao his report was submitted to rep kika de la 
garza dtex chairman of the house agriculture commitee 
mendelowitz said cargills earnings come not only from 
commissions but also depend on the prices it paid us farmers 
which may have been higher than the prices it received in moscow 
as well as on the subsidies it received from the us government 
those subsidies are paid in the form of surplus farm products 
already owned by the government 
egypt was the second biggest beneficiary under the us program 
which paid us dealers 3118 million in such commodities to help 
exports there egypt got frozen poultry dairy cattle and semolina 
too but wheat and wheat flour were much the biggest items 
china received some cattle but mostly wheat subsidies for 
shipments there totaled 2995 million 
algeria a major wheat producer also got mainly wheat from the 
united states the bonuses on exports there were worth 2069 
million including some for barley semolina and vegetable oil

an english psychiatric center founded by sigmund 
freuds daughter is entitled to onefourth of marilyn monroes 
estate a judge ruled monday 
miss monroe had left the share estimated to be worth millions 
of dollars to her psychiatrist who died in 1980 
manhattan surrogate marie lambert decided that the psychiatrist 
dr marianne kris had the right to bequeath her share of monroes 
estate to the anna freud centre for the psychoanalytic study and 
treatment of children in london 
miss monroe who starred in such movies as bus stop 
gentlemen prefer blondes the sevenyear itch and some 
like it hot died in 1962 from an overdose of drugs and alcohol 
in a threepage will dated jan 14 1961 miss monroe left the 
rest of her estate to her acting coach lee strasberg 
strasbergs widow anna was appointed in july as administrator 
of miss monroes estate after the original executors death earlier 
in the year mrs strasberg challenged the psychiatric centers 
right to the money saying kris rights to the estate ended when 
she died 
kris reportedly never collected any proceeds from miss monroes 
estate but in her own will she left her share to the hampstead 
child therapy clinic renamed for its founder anna freud 
had lambert ruled in mrs strasbergs favor kris share would 
have gone to strasbergs estate but lambert noted that mrs 
strasberg had said she would donate the disputed share to charity 
bernard green lawyer for the center said it is impossible to 
say exactly what the estate is worth but added its not an 
insubstantial amount

senate republican leader bob dole on monday 
warned president bush of a political backlash from voters unless 
the administration speeds up work on the savings and loan bailout 
this thing could be an albatross in 1992 which happens to 
be an election year the kansas republican said i think george 
bush has some interest in staying on 
the resolution trust corp the new agency created to dispose of 
failed thrifts has sold only 50 of the more than 380 sampls under 
government control and is not living up to expectations dole 
said 
he said the delay is driving up the cost of the bailout 
estimated at 160 billion over 10 years 
weve got to get this thing going ive got a feeling this 
thing is going to get out of hand one of these days and the 
american people are going to start saying what are you doing 
about it he told a meeting of the national association of 
federal credit unions 
the republican leader said the administration must fill vacant 
positions in the savings and loan bureaucracy and resolve an 
apparent turf battle between the resolution trust corp and a 
treasury departmentled oversight board 
and congress must go back and take a look at sampl legislation 
if not this year then early next year he said the chairmen 
of both the house and senate banking committees say they oppose 
revising the law this year 
but dole said the sampl law contributes to what he called a 
sluggishness that is gripping the bureaucracy by establishing 
conflicting guidelines 
congress ordered the administration to dispose of property from 
sampls quickly but avoid dumping property on the market it said the 
government should get the highest price for the assets but offer 
lowincome groups the first chance to buy some of the property 
as a result the rtc is timid dole said theyre afraid 
of congress theyre afraid of public hearings they dont want to 
do anything innovative 
we in congress are trying to have it both ways he said 
keep this in mind because a year from now nobody in 
congress is going to tell you we did that theyre going to blame 
the administration 
dole said hes sounded his warning in a conversation with the 
president in a letter to treasury secretary nicholas f brady and 
in a meeting last week with white house chief of staff john sununu

transit officials passed a resolution monday 
condemning a federal transportation policy they said could put some 
of them out business but praised its author transportation 
secretary samuel skinner 
the american public transit association which includes transit 
officials and suppliers from around the country urged a 7 
centsagallon federal gas tax increase for mass transit and said 
skinners policy fails to set clear meaningful goals for 
increased transit use 
the resolution was approved on a unanimous voice vote by about 
500 participants 
however several officials said they still had faith in skinner 
whose policy was unveiled at the white house last week and believe 
he will fight for their goals even though his policy doesnt 
ive lost no confidence in sam skinner at all said rod 
diridon chairman of californias santa clara county transportation 
agency he blamed the policys shortcomings on changes made by the 
white houses office of management and budget and chief of staff 
john sununu 
dan scannell of new yorks metropolitan transportation authority 
said he expected skinner who formerly headed the chicago area 
transit system to fight for the principles that should be 
embraced 
william millar manager of pittsburghs transit system said the 
industry trusts skinner and the people who work for him 
all of us have a boss he said referring to the fact that 
skinner works for president bush who has pledged not to raise 
taxes the boss may be saying something different from what any 
of us may want to do 
millar said however the policy that would shift more 
responsibility to local governments and decrease federal support 
for mass transit could put people out of work and make it so 
others cant get to work 
hershel r payne head of transportation for fort worth texas 
said the increased flexibility the policy would give local 
governments would mean a reduction in federal assistance 
it would hit every transportation system in the country from 
the smallest to the largest payne said many systems may even 
have to close down and fares in others could go up 25 percent 
neil peterson los angeles county transportation commission 
director said the proposals would restrict development of a new 
transit system in the county and mean even more congested freeways 
he predicted the congestion would lower the average speed which 
now is only 37 mph to 17 mph in 20 years 
vicki shaffer who runs the 25bus system in huntington wva 
said her 50employee operation could not have started without 
federal help 
the policy says to us forget it she said if you 
cannot put your money where your mouth is dont tell me you have a 
policy

the bush administration pressed the israeli 
government monday to overcome its indecision about a us plan for 
negotiations with palestinian arabs and to approve a formula put 
together by secretary of state james a baker iii 
we are waiting for an answer from the israeli government 
state department spokeswoman margaret d tutwiler said when the 
answer comes back then we will know how to proceed 
while baker kept his distance lowerlevel us diplomats were 
in touch with israeli officials there was no immediate word on 
whether baker would soften any of the terms to accommodate prime 
minister yitzhak shamir and other members of the conservative likud 
coalition 
i would hate to say anything is locked in concrete ms 
tutwiler said we are in a negotiations 
shamir and his supporters objected to the inclusion in the 
delegation of cairo talks palestinians with a residence in east 
jerusalem or deported from the west bank 
the provision inserted by baker in deference to egypt and the 
palestine liberation organization appeared to challenge israels 
retention of the predominantly arab part of jerusalem as well as 
handling of a palestinian rebellion on the west bank and in gaza 
a statement by president bush calling east jerusalem and the 
west bank offlimits to jewish settlers also irritated shamir 
on sunday the prime minister refused to put bakers plan to a 
vote before the 12member israeli inner cabinet the inaction 
raised the prospect of a government crisis in jerusalem and 
abandonment by baker of his eightmonth effort to launch 
negotiations 
shimon peres leader of the opposition labor party accused 
shamir on monday of leaving israel in a desert of indecision 
white house and state department officials said the bush 
administration would not give up in seeking approval of the baker 
plan 
the process is still continuing were still talking and were 
still hopeful marlin fitzwater the white house press secretary 
said 
asked if bushs comments on east jerusalem had set the talks 
back fitzwater replied no the process of peace talks is a long 
and arduous one there have been stops and starts and its still 
continuing and we just continue to watch the process and be 
supportive as we can 
state department spokeswoman tutwiler said meanwhile the sole 
us objective in promoting israelipalestinian talks was to help 
israel implement its own plan for elections on the west bank and 
gaza 
what we are looking for is agreement on moving towards 
peace she said 
meanwhile thomas a dine executive director of the american 
israel public affairs committee accused the bush administration in 
a speech sunday night of a new american tilt that had caused 
the plo to rejoice and brought unhappiness to likud and labor 
circles in israel 
dine criticized bushs statement on jerusalem and testimony by 
baker and john kelly the assistant secretary of state for the near 
east crediting plo chairman yasser arafat with honoring his 
renunciation of terrorism 
settlements on the west bank are a matter on which israelis 
themselves and our community here are divided dine said 
some favor them and others are opposed but the right of jews to 
live anywhere in jerusalem has never before been questioned by 
any american president certainly not publicly

taking ukuleles to hawaii 
sounds about as misplaced as shipping coals to newcastle 
but thats what 25 vancouverarea students aged 9 to 19 are 
doing this week 
even though the ukulele is the key instrument in their society 
its as hawaiian as the grass skirt the school authorities over 
there want to learn the canadian teaching methods we use which are 
so successful said peter luongo vice principal and music 
specialist at alice brown elementary 
the school has become so skilled at teaching the fourstringed 
guitarlike instrument that word has reached hawaii 
the ukulele introduced from portugal into the hawaiian islands 
about 1879 was first used in canadian schools in the maritime 
provinces about 20 years ago to teach music he said 
it came to langley about 15 years ago and we got some really 
keen kids he said i picked up the program when i came here 
and developed a senior honors group 
the students have played in concerts across canada and will pay 
for most of the 10day trip beginning thursday 
we will be given a lot of hospitality but well be going to 
schools that are very meager compared to ours and i think our 
students will learn a lot about the other side of hawaii its not 
all plush hotels luongo said

capitol steps 8yearold jennifer keelan joined some 60 disabled 
americans monday in lobbying for legislation to guarantee their 
civil rights 
ill take all night if i have to jennifer said to others 
crawling alongside her she paused just past the halfway point for 
a sip of water on a bright and unseasonably hot march day then 
resumed pulling herself along the rest of the 83 marble steps 
keelan a blondhaired second grader from denver was the

mental disability in employment access to buildings use of the

slipping and said the administration was negotiating over the bill 
with key members of congress

mikhail s gorbachevs plan for a powerful 
presidency to hold the soviet union together ran into a wall of 
opposition monday one day after lithuania fractured the union by 
declaring its independence 
parliamentarians from other independenceminded republics took 
the floor of the congress of peoples deputies to assail the 
proposed presidency as far too strong for the loose federation of 
sovereign countries they envision as the future soviet union 
the fact that the ussr is a union of sovereign states is 
hardly taken into account said givi gumbaridze communist party 
chief of the southern republic of georgia where the parliament 
voted friday to reject the presidency proposal and to demand 
immediate negotiations with moscow on independence 
this draft does not give enough consideration to the sad 
traditions of our state he said referring to decades of 
dictatorship and its terrible toll of mass murder 
lithuanians were so dismayed by gorbachevs proposed 
strengthening of the presidency that they rushed to declare 
independence before it passed 
tomorrow mr gorbachev will get dictatorial powers with the 
right to overrun any republican parliament said algimantas 
chekuolis a lithuanian who with his republics declaration of 
independence now describes himself as a former member of the soviet 
congress attending as an observer 
as gorbachev opened the session he called the lithuanian action 
alarming without ever mentioning the word independence he 
suggested that the government study what is happening and prepare a 
reaction 
another member of the ruling communist party politburo yegor k 
ligachev said moscow would not use force in lithuania 
progressive moscow deputy alexei yablokov said legislators from 
georgia moldavia azerbaijan estonia and latvia are expected to 
boycott tuesdays vote on the constitutional amendment which could 
fail for lack of the required twothirds majority all five of 
those republics are possible candidates for following the 
lithuanians into secession 
but throughout the day deputies huddled with gorbachev and each 
other seeking compromises 
at one point estonian president arnold ruutel gorbachev and 
gorbachevs aide georgi shakhnazarov pulled up chairs behind the 
dais and ruutel earnestly pitched a deal to the soviet leader 
ruutel told reporters estonia was seeking assurances that gorbachev 
would negotiate the baltic states future relationship with moscow 
but he refused to say if the estonians would trade that promise for 
their votes on the presidency 
also on the agenda of the special session of congress were 
constitutional amendments to end the communist partys monopoly on 
power and substitute a multiparty political system and to allow 
individuals to own factories and lease land 
another draft amendment would ban any party or organization 
whose goal is violent overthrow of the constitutional structure or 
the socialist state 
if the presidency proposal is approved tuesday deputies will 
then nominate and elect someone to the job possibly the same day 
gorbachev is the only candidate whose name has been mentioned thus 
far and he is expected to win said progressive deputy sergei 
stankevich 
gorbachev has said the new powers are needed so the soviet union 
wont fall into a ethnic and nationalist violence that could 
threaten his campaign for democratization and reform the supreme 
soviet an arm of the congress that functions as the working 
legislature voted overwhelmingly to support the proposal feb 27 
soviet vice president anatoly lukyanov introduced the latest 
draft of the presidency proposal monday by promising there is no 
reason to believe that the institution of the presidency would lead 
to alleged authoritarian power 
lukyanov said the bill creates checks and balances between the 
executive and legislative branches of power he said the congress 
may recall the president for violating laws or the constitution 
but only the congress and the supreme soviet may pass laws 
the current constitution still allows the presidium headed by 
gorbachev to issue decrees 
progressive deputy anatoly sobchak said a tentative compromise 
had been reached on the most controversial point allowing the 
president to declare a state of emergency suspend the parliament 
of a republic and take over its administration it would require 
him to obtain permission from the republic or the national 
parliament he said at a news conference 
gorbachev supporter sergei alexeyev argued the soviet union is 
in a paralysis of power and the presidency is the only way 
to transfer the real power from the party to the government 
if the presidency issue is resolved positively we can get 
down to drafting a new constitution immediately which will confirm 
human rights democracy and conversion to a market economy 
alexeyev said 
but vitaly vorotnikov president of the russian federation 
alarmed deputies from the smaller republics when he said the 
country needed a president to ensure strict compliance with all 
the laws of the union 
several of the independenceoriented republics have adopted 
constitutional amendments allowing them to suspend soviet laws on 
their territory 
the constitutional amendment requires a twothirds majority or 
1500 of the 2250 members of the congress a close vote could 
force gorbachev into a difficult choice recognize that the 
lithuanians are no longer members of congress thus lowering the 
needed margin to 1462 votes out of 2192 or risk losing the vote 
yuri afanasyev a leader of a group of progressive deputies 
urged the presidency be adopted only in conjunction with a new 
constitution direct election of the president real opposition 
parties freedom of the press and a new union treaty 
he angered many of the deputies by attacking soviet founder 
vladimir lenin 
the use of force and violence is our entire history if our 
leader and founder laid the foundation of anything it was the 
institution of mass violence and state terror he said deputies 
shouted their anger 
afanasyev a historian said later he was proud of the statement 
even though it undoubtedly cost the progressives votes

at the doors to lithuanias supreme 
soviet renamed the supreme council artist kestutis balikonis 
was touching up the paint monday under the banner of a medieval 
knight that replaced the metal soviet hammer and sickle torn down 
the night before 
in concrete daily life nothing has changed since lithuania 
declared its independence from the soviet union on sunday night he 
said 
but he added now were living in the hope that something will 
change 
we know that at the beginning things will be harder but no 
one says we shouldnt have done this even though everyone is a 
little concerned balikonis said 
in the blustery lithuanian capital there were no special signs 
of rejoicing monday no banner headlines in the newspapers and no 
special flags flying or bells ringing virtually all the signs of a 
halfcentury of soviet control remained 
only a dozen or so stalwart activists gathered in the rain in 
front of the supreme councils concrete columns 
residents and legislators said the joy over the moves for 
independence was overshadowed by trepidation about the possible 
consequences and whether lithuanias new government would make the 
right moves 
in discussions monday the supreme council turned to thorny 
economic issues including the question of the fate of 
moscowcontrolled factories on lithuanian soil 
with no direct response from moscow members of the 141seat 
supreme council drafted a message to president mikhail s 
gorbachev asking him to recognize lithuanias statehood and begin 
talks with the republic on restoration of its independence 
gorbachev told the congress of peoples deputies in moscow that 
lithuanias action was alarming but gave no further reaction 
another member of the ruling communist party politburo yegor k 
ligachev said the kremlin would not use force against lithuania 
the soviet leader has told lithuanian leaders that he will 
demand 21 billion rubles about 34 billion as compensation for 
a halfcentury of investment in lithuania 
but lithuania independence leader algimantas chekuolis also in 
moscow for the congress said the republics bill to moscow for 
damages done during that time was 300 billion rubles about 500 
billion 
he said that figure included compensation for 300000 
lithuanians killed imprisoned or exiled during soviet rule and 
for kremlininspired economic failures 
earlier in the day vytautas landsbergis lithuanias new 
president warned legislators to expect disappointment and 
unpleasantness in the near future 
hope and joy must dissolve into determination to work for 
lithuania we must work very hard he told the supreme council 
despite peoples fears sunday nights decison brought a wave of 
euphoria for many 
balikonis said a strange man offered him a cigarette and said 
cant you already breathe easier 
many parents told their children to remember this day of 
lithuanias freedom said council deputy vidmante lasukaitete 
but she added that many people were upset that algirdas 
brazauskas the popular communist party chief who had served as 
president lost his reelection bid to landsbergis a music 
professor who led the proindependence sajudis movement at 
sundays parliamentary session 
people are happy about independence but would have wanted a 
different president lasukaitete said 
kestutis rimkus a deputy from rural lithuania said his 
constituents were concerned that the supreme council had rushed its 
decision on independence and bringing in a provisional constitution 
no one is thinking now theyre just living by their 
emotions he complained 
balchas saulius a student at vilnius teachers institute said 
lithuanians agreed with the traditional communist saying we have 
nothing to lose but our chains 
its not important what happens we are ready for everything 
even being hungry and cold added philosophy professor stase 
radziuniene 
they said they expected a restrained political reaction from 
moscow but also an intense supply blockade and other tough 
measures intended to punish lithuania economically 
they also expected harassment of 50000 lithuanians serving in 
the soviet armed forces by their fellow soldiers and problems from 
lithuanias minorities the poles russians jews and others that 
make up 20 percent of the republics 37 million people 
russians in the port city of klaipeda have already launched a 
petition drive to append their area to the russian republic the 
activists said 
gorbachev has suggested that klaipeda a port on the baltic sea 
may be the subject of a territorial dispute because post world war 
ii documents do not specifically include it in lithuania

the robbery of a gold merchant by armed 
palestinians in the west bank town of nablus on monday raised fears 
that a new gang of selfstyled enforcers has emerged 
arab reports said two palestinian men armed with israelimade 
uzi submacine guns entered a shop near the nablus central market 
and robbed the merchant of 11 pounds of gold 
last year a palestinian gang called the black panthers financed 
its campaign of assassinations against arabs suspected of 
cooperating with israel by stealing 176 pounds of gold from a 
nablus merchant

leaders were killed in a raid by israeli troops they are believed 
affiliated with yasser arafats fatah faction in the plo

the marxist popular front for the liberation of palestine was 
smashed by the army in november 
the robbers monday were believed to be renegade fatah members 
arab reports said they said both men were wanted by israeli police 
for activities related to the 27monthold palestinian uprising 
against israeli rule 
after the theft masked palestinians affiliated with fatah 
marched through the nablus market and announced over loudspeakers 
they would pursue the robbers and try to recover the gold 
fatah leaders last fall appealed in vain to the black panthers 
and the red eagles to end their killings of suspected collaborators 
also in nablus on monday three masked palestinians armed with 
swords and clubs forced their way into a cosmetics shop owned by 
palestinian businessman saeed kanaan and smashed some of his goods 
kanaan refused to comment on the incident 
the shop was attacked for a second time that night when four 
masked palestinians smashed the windows and set the store ablaze 
nablus residents said they said the shop suffered moderate damage 
before firefighters arrived 
kanaan a moderate palestian leader who supports fatah was 
threatened by palestinian radicals after reports were published in 
a hebrewlanguage daily suggesting that he would be named to a 
delegation opening preliminary peace talks with israel 
kanaan later took out advertisements in arab newspapers denying 
the report 
also monday palestinian jamal muhammed khalifa 17 died of 
bullet wounds suffered in a stonethrowing clash with israeli 
soldiers sunday night in the akhbat jaber refugee camp in jericho 
hospital officials said 
the army confirmed the death and said soldiers opened fired when 
attacked by a group of masked youths 
his death raised to 663 the number of palestinians killed by 
israelis during the uprising another 196 palestinians have been 
killed by fellow arabs most on suspicion of collaborating with 
israel and 43 israelis have died

autoworkers without jobs an auto industry official said monday in 
the most concrete sign that east germanys radical changes could 
mean widespread unemployment

accustomed to four decades of near full employment under the 
nowdisgraced communist party

six irishmen convicted of the worst terrorist 
bombing in modern british history deserve a new trial because 
police beat confessions out of them and new evidence has been 
ignored witnesses told a congressional panel monday 
on rare occasions we raise questions of human rights concerns 
in democratic societies said rep thomas lantos dcalif 
chairman of the congressional human rights caucus a bipartisan 
group of 200 members of congress 
democratic societies occasionally go wrong he said 
the irishmen known as the birmingham six were convicted of 
planting bombs in two pubs in birmingham england the bombs went 
off without warning minutes apart on nov 21 1974 killing 21 
people and injuring 162 
the attack was the most deadly in a series of bombings many 
linked to the irish republican army in england that year 
in this case justice has yet to be done said rep joseph 
p kennedy ii dmass who called the hearing 
witnesses said monday that the six irishmen arrested the night 
of the bombings confessed under severe police beatings and 
intimidation 
we are confronted here today with a human rights abuse said 
anthony gifford a member of the british house of lords and an 
attorney for two of the defendants 
seamus mallon a member of the british house of commons 
representing ireland told the caucus that the ira not the 
birmingham six was responsible for the bombings 
i believe it is in the interest of peace and the interest of 
stability to see that justice is done mallon said 
the six hugh callaghan patrick hill gerry hunter richard 
mcilkenny billy power and johnny walker are serving life 
sentences for murder 
a 1988 court of appeals decision upheld the life sentences but 
since then the west midlands serious crimes squad was disbanded 
after several of its officers were charged with corruption and 
fabricating evidence in later cases according to a congressional 
summary among those under investigation are five officers who were 
also involved in the birmingham six case 
british home secretary david waddington is considering new 
evidence in the case the home secretary is responsible for the 
administration of prisons and law and order among other things 
meanwhile human rights groups including amnesty international 
have called for another look at the case and more than 130 members 
of parliament advocated a reopening of the investigation after one 
member said he had interviewed people claiming responsibility for 
the bombings 
francis cornish a spokesman for the british embassy in 
washington questioned whether the hearing could accomplish 
anything because the government is already considering the case 
were in the middle of due process on this cornish said 
we dont see what can come out of this hearing apart from 
pressure for us to continue the process

influential in helping to shape policy in japan as leader of the 
liberal democatic party takeshita resigned as prime minister after

an expert witness testified monday that 
the exxon valdez disaster would not have happened if skipper joseph 
hazelwood had been on the bridge but insisted hazelwood didnt 
cause the nations worst oil spill 
former tanker captain shiras walker testifying for the defense 
in hazelwoods trial said he believes the third mate gregory 
cousins was responsible for the march 24 grounding of the exxon 
valdez 
walker also said he believes hazelwoods remarks immediately 
after the grounding were meaningless because he was coming apart 
mentally he was telling them what they wanted to hear 
for that reason walker said he discounted hazelwoods remarks 
that he was trying to move the grounded tanker off jagged bligh 
reef he said he believed the skipper actually was stabilizing the 
vessel so it would not float off the reef with the coming high tide 
walker said his opinions were based on experience commanding 
similar tankers declaring i walked several thousand miles in 
capt hazelwoods shoes 
hazelwood 43 of huntington ny was the only crew member of 
the exxon valdez charged criminally in the wreck which spilled 
nearly 11 million gallons of oil 
he is accused of criminal mischief reckless endangerment 
operating a vessel while intoxicated and negligent discharge of 
oil if convicted he faces a maximum penalty of 7 years in prison 
and 61000 in fines 
isnt it true that if capt hazelwood was on the bridge where 
he was supposed to be this wouldnt have happened assistant 
district attorney mary anne henry asked during crossexamination 
after the judge overruled a defense objection that the question 
called for speculation walker answered i might disagree with 
that supposed to be part but if capt hazelwood was on the 
bridge during those maneuvers this accident wouldnt have 
happened 
under redirect questioning from the defense walker was asked 
whether he believed hazelwoods absence from the bridge contributed 
to the grounding of the vessel in any way 
none at all walker answered 
the former captain told jurors that the only regulation he knows 
of requiring a captain to be on the bridge is during a transit of 
the panama canal 
earlier walker testified that the third mate had failed to 
properly carry out orders left behind by hazelwood walker said it 
was the third mates responsibility to see to it that hazelwoods 
orders were carried out by the helmsman who failed to execute the 
10degree right turn called for 
walker was the first witness in the lengthy trial to directly 
point a finger at third mate gregory cousins who was placed in 
control of the ship while hazelwood went below to do paperwork 
most other witnesses have blamed the helmsman robert kagan 
walker testifying on crossexamination acknowledged that he 
considers a helmsman just another piece of the machinery and 
indicated the third mate should have kept close watch to make sure 
he obeyed orders 
he said the only thing the helmsman needed to know to carry out 
his job was knowing the difference between right and left and the 
ability to read the numbers 1 through 35 
asked whether any ablebodied seaman should be able to carry out 
an order for a 10degree right turn the witness replied 
probably anybody above the age of 5 could have carried that out 
so what you are saying is that if greg cousins had followed 
capt hazelwoods instructions and watched the rudder angle 
indicator to make sure the rudder angle order was being obeyed the 
exxon valdez would not have hit bligh reef the prosecutor asked 
yes maam said walker 
and what youre saying is that because greg cousins did not 
follow capt hazelwoods order the grounding is cousins fault 
henry added 
yes maam responded walker 
and capt hazelwood is not at fault at all henry asked 
no maam said the witness

the federal aviation administration said 
monday it would upgrade the training of its inspectors to prevent 
crews from flying airliners under heavy alcohol influence 
an inexperienced faa inspector in fargo nd allowed a 
northwest airlines jet to take off last thursday despite a tip that 
the crew had been drinking for more than six hours 
faa administrator james busey told the chairman of the house 
aviation subcommittee monday he was going to get their 
inspectors training upgraded to deal with situations like that 
said faa spokesperson joann sloane 
the system could fail again the same way rep jim oberstar 
dminn said at a news conference after meeting with busey the 
faa is going to act on this quickly or were going to burn their 
behind 
sloane said she could not provide any details of how the 
inspector training would be improved 
the three crew members on the flight from fargo to minneapolis 
were arrested upon landing last thursday when blood tests showed 
excessive alcohol levels the faa revoked their licenses 
the fargo inspector didnt detain the crew members because they 
didnt smell of alcohol and didnt appear to be impaired said 
oberstar the inspector interviewed the men and observed them for 
more than an hour while they prepared for departure oberstar said 
the faa had said that the fargo inspector did not have the 
authority to stop the plane from taking off under north dakota law 
and that the tip didnt consitute evidence of intoxication 
however oberstar said northwest or any other airline would have 
voluntarily grounded the flight had it been warned of the 
allegations 
you dont want to throw the book at this faa inspector at this 
point but there clearly ought to have been training at some 
point to deal with these circumstances he said 
the faa said sunday that it received an anonymous tip at least 
three hours before the boeing 727 with 91 passengers left fargo 
the person making the call said the cockpit crew had been drinking 
northwest airlines received a similar tip but could not match 
the names it was given with its crew list oberstar said 
flight 650 took off from hector international airport in fargo 
at 625 am local time after an unexplained 25minute delay that 
northwest said is part of the companys investigation 
it arrived in minneapolis at 730 am and the crew was placed 
under citizens arrest by an faa inspector at the airport detained 
by the airport police and given a bloodalcohol test 
busey announced friday that the test showed all three had a 
blood alcohol level above 04 percent exceeding the federal limit 
for flight crews 
the three have the right to appeal their emergency license 
revocations within 10 days to the national transportation safety 
board 
the minneapolis city attorneys office said charges might be 
brought this week under state law flying while intoxicated is a 
misdemeanor carrying up to 90 days jail and a 700 fine 
airport police identified the crew members as capt norman 
prouse 51 of conyers ga first officer robert j kirchner 35 
of highland ranch colo and second officer joseph w balzer 34 
of antioch tenn 
attempts to reach prouse have been unsuccessful kirchner has 
not returned phone calls and balzer referred questions to attorneys 
for the air line pilots association

he faces a maximum penalty of 250000 in fines and five years 
imprisonment when he is sentenced may 18 for his actions from 1980 
through 1985 
the documents involved were those that summarize the resources 
the pentagon is planning to spend in future years said richard 
smith assistant special agent in charge of the defense criminal 
investigative services washington field office the case also 
involved air force budget documents according to court papers 
mr kotellos was a significant player in the tightly knit 
group which acquired and distributed some very sensitive dod 
information said michael j costello special agent in charge of 
the dcis washington field office we have attempted to reach the 
inner core of the network and neutralize it 
investigators would not say whether grumman itself was under 
investigation 
but grumman spokesman larry hamilton said grumman is engaged 
in discussions with the government as to the consequences to the 
company of mr kotellos plea since this matter continues to be 
under review the company cannot comment on these discussions 
the dcis field office has been conducting an investigation 
codenamed operation uncover since the mid1980s into illegal 
transfers of pentagon documents to defense contractors 
last friday hughes aircraft co became the fourth major defense 
contractor to plead guilty to unlawfully obtaining defense 
department budget documents and agreed to pay a total of 367 
million in fines and restitution 
previous companies to plead guilty are 
gte government systems division which paid about 300000 in 
fines in 1985 
the boeing company which paid fines and restitution of 52 
million last november boeing employee richard lee fowler was 
convicted last december of all counts of a 39count indictment 
rca corp which was ordered feb 5 to pay fines and 
restitution of 275 million former rca employee leonard kampf and 
current rca employee ronald stevens each pleaded guilty to one 
felony count and face sentencing april 6 
the plea agreement submitted monday to us district judge 
claude hilton is contingent on kotellos cooperation in the probe 
the conspiracy count says kotellos acquired classified documents 
from a government employee who was not authorized to release them 
getting classified documents from fowler of boeing sharing 
classified documents with other defense contractors and obtaining 
such documents from them and destroying some of the documents in 
his fireplace at home 
the government employee was not identified in court papers and 
smith declined to reveal the name or to say whether that person was 
under investigation 
the source close to the investigation said he believed 
prosecutors may have a problem with the statute of limitations 
in the case against the government employee because of a lack of 
information of wrongdoing after 1984 
the court papers say kotellos got documents from the government 
employee on approximately two occasions between 1980 and december 
1984 
said smith in a continuing conspiracy the last overt act 
that an individual or corporation does in furtherance of that 
conspiracy can continue the life of the statute of limitations 
the 1985 actions enabled prosecutors to go after kotellos smith 
said 
kotellos was placed on administrative leave with pay from his 
job as a senior marketing analyst at the washington operations 
office on monday morning said grumman spokesman larry hamilton

shimon peres won labor party approval monday to 
bring down the government after accusing prime minister yitzhak 
shamir of leading israel into the desert of indecision about 
peace talks with palestinians 
the decision by labor which is in a national unity 
coalition with shamirs conservative likud bloc set the stage for 
a showdown peres leads the labor party and is vice premier 
reports said shamir might dismiss labor ministers from the 
cabinet 
if the government falls elections would be likely the last two 
elections were indecisive and tenuous likudlabor coalitions 
resulted 
in washington white house spokesman marlin fitzwater was asked 
whether the united states was concerned about israels failure to 
accept the peace proposals of secretary of state james a baker 
iii he replied 
well the process is still continuing were still talking and 
were still hopeful the process of peace talks is a long and 
arduous one 
peres told the 1300 members of the centerleft labors central 
committee the prime minister was stalling by not responding to the 
baker proposals 
the thing is not moving very simply he said in a 
nationally broadcast speech to the labor leadership 
we have reached the conclusion that shamir will try to run a 
policy of saying neither yes nor no he will try to avoid the 
decision and will pull us into the desert of indecision 
defense minister yitzhak rabin speaking after peres said 
the problem the delay the obstacle in the peace process is 
likuds refusal to vote on a positive answer our duty is to 
guarantee a perpetual progress and we shall do it in any way 
possible 
at the end of an 80minute meeting held at beit berl near tel 
aviv the labor leadership approved a vaguely worded twopoint 
resolution with only one member dissenting 
it said likud prevented a cabinet vote on essential issues 
relating to the peace process and threatened continuation of 
diplomatic efforts 
the resolution authorized the labor leadership and the partys 
39 members in the 120seat parliament to determine the 
parliamentary moves necessitated by the situation 
that gave peres a mandate to try to bring down the government by 
putting his labor party in league with smaller leftist and 
religious parties that seek a confidence vote in parliament 
chaim ramon head of labors parliament faction offered shamir 
a lastminute escape saying 
we shall treat the noconfidence motions in accordance with 
the prime ministers behavior in the issue of peace i hope that 
until then the prime minister would use the opportunity provided by 
us and would say yes to the peace process 
in his speech peres suggested he could work out a deal with the 
religious parties a key element in any narrow government 
israel tv said labor launched intensive contacts with two 
ultraorthodox parties immediately after the central committee 
vote the negotiations with agudat israel and torah flag parties 
are expected to last until early tuesday the television said 
a confidence vote is expected thursday unless a compromise is 
worked out to save the 15monthold government 
zevulun hammer of the national religious party religious 
affairs minister said earlier monday he was trying to find common 
ground after the labor vote he said i believe that my effort 
still has a chance 
shortly before the labor decision however shamir aide avi 
pazner said little room was left for compromise 
it looks like the two parties are going for a showdown 
thursday he said it would take a miracle to reach a 
compromise before that 
cabinet member ronnie milo of likud said the decision clearly 
meant labor had decided to end the coalition 
labor is not thinking of the peace process he said they 
want to break the government to advance their partys and personal 
interests 
if you decide you cannot be partners in such a government 
stand up and resign dont try to stay in the government while 
attempting to bring it down 
shamir was said to be considering dismissal of all 10 labor 
ministers so they could not be part of a transitional government 
that would take over if a noconfidence motion passed 
the government crisis began last month when labor demanded the 
cabinet approve the baker proposals which had been under 
consideration since october 
on sunday shamir refused to allow the decisionmaking inner 
cabinet to vote on the plan which involves arranging preliminary 
israelipalestinian peace talks in cairo the inner cabinet is made 
up of six labor and six likud ministers 
labor ministers walked out of the meeting on grounds the failure 
to vote meant a negative response 
labor supports the baker proposals but likud says the provision 
for including residents of arab east jerusalem in the talks could 
threaten israels declared sovereignty over the area 
likud also opposes participation by exiled palestinians on 
grounds that could provide an opening to the talks for the 
palestine liberation organization which israel views as a 
terrorist organization 
hammer has suggested israel give baker a positive answer with 
the question of participation by east jerusalem arabs to be decided 
by parliament 
the israelpalestinian talks are meant to lead to eventual 
elections in the israelioccupied territories with their final 
status decided later

the soviet union lodged a strong protest 
with the united states on monday over the handling of victor i 
sheymov a kgb defector who surfaced after nearly a decade in the 
united states 
sergey b chetverikov ministercounselor at the soviet embassy 
accused us intelligence agencies of subversive action for 
smuggling sheymov his wife and 5yearold daughter out of the 
soviet union in 1980 
the familys exit from the soviet union was a gross violation 
of rules of international law which is in fact an act of state 
terrorism chetverikov told reporters at a news conference 
chetverikov said he met with deputy secretary of state lawrence 
eagleburger on monday to complain about the sheymov affair 
chetverikov said he was particularly concerned about allegations 
sheymov made as a time of a thaw in relations between the two 
superpowers 
the soviet embassy lodged a strong protest with the state 
department he said 
the state department had no immediate comment 
chetverikov confirmed that sheymov was employed by the kgb but 
the embassy official said he worked as a coding equipment 
maintenance technician as such sheymov had no access to 
serious secret information including documents the embassy 
official said 
sheymov 43 appeared at a press conference march 2 making a 
series of allegations 
among other things he said that in the late 1970s the soviet 
union had two sources inside the state department who were able to 
deliver secret information on us policy and negotiating 
positions the department refused any comment on that case at the 
time 
sheymov also said he was present in the warsaw station of the 
kgb in 1979 when a cable arrived from moscow ordering what he 
believed to be the initial stages of a plot to assassinate pope 
john paul ii 
the soviet embassy denied sheymovs claim about the pope 
totally untenable and malicious from beginning to end is his 
assertion about the committee for state securitys involvement in 
the affair relating to the attempt on pope john paul iis life 
chetverikov said 
he said the cia leadership knew very well that the kgb had not 
and could not have anything to do with this heinous crime 
allegations have long circulated about possible soviet involvement 
in a plot to kill the pope after the pope was wounded by a gunmans 
bullet in 1981 no connection with moscow has ever been firmly 
established however 
chetverikov also said hints about the kgbs involvement in 
organizing the attempt on the late president zia ul haq of pakistan 
can also be described as wild fiction zia was killed when a 
plane blew up in pakistan in 1988 
chetverikov claimed that the cia had put statements in sheymovs 
mouth as a hostile action forces inside the united states the 
soviet official said were bent on disrupting growing ties between 
moscow and washington sheymov has said he is looking for a 
publisher for his book 
despite the protest chetverikov said he doubted moscow would 
retaliate in any way against the united states i guess we are 
beyond that stage he said 
at the same time he said sheymovs actions had a very 
negative effect on perceptions in the soviet union

congratulations came mixed with caution 
the bush administration expressed support for lithuanias move 
while saying the united states will delay formal recognition of the 
breakaway republic until the lithuanians are in control of their 
own destiny 
white house spokesman marlin fitzwater reiterated the 
administrations call for the soviet central government to 
respect the will of the citizens in the baltic state 
the newly elected noncommunist legislature of lithuania on 
sunday voted to declare its independence 50 years after the soviet 
union annexed the sovereign state of lithuania on the basis of an 
agreement with nazi germany 
the united states and other western nations never recognized the 
soviet unions forcible annexation of lithuania in 1940 and its 
baltic neighbors latvia and estonia while under red army 
occupation the three states once part of czarist russia had 
gained independence after world war i 
foreign office minister william waldegrave said in london on 
monday that britain is fascinated by lithuanias action but 
has no immediate plans to recognize lithuania as a country separate 
from the soviet union 
the legal right of the lithuanian people to seek 
selfdetermination is not in question but when it comes to the 
recognition of states we havent quite got to that point yet 
we may well do so waldegrave said in a british broadcasting 
corp radio interview 
waldegrave said a considerable negotiation with the soviet 
union would have to take place before lithuanians know the full 
extent of the implications of what they are seeking 
fitzwater too remarked at a news briefing that washington was 
not recognizing the new government at once because we would want 
any recognition to take into account a final government that was in 
control of their own destiny and much of that has yet to be 
negotiated with the soviet union 
soviet president mikhail s gorbachev called lithuanias move 
alarming when he opened a congress of communist party deputies 
monday in moscow but gave no indication he plans any action to 
prevent lithuania from seceding 
the solidarityled government in poland expressed hope monday 
that neighboring lithuania would be able to achieve statehood in a 
peaceful way 
the polish government supports nations selfdetermination 
including selfdetermination leading to separate statehood 
government spokeswoman malgorzata niezabitowska said in a statement 
on the nightly news 
earlier monday solidarity leader lech walesa expressed his joy 
at the decision in a message sent to vytautas lansbergis 
lithuanias new president adding that he hoped the process of 
separation would be peaceful 
historical links between lithuania and poland date to 1386 when 
the lithuanian ruler jagiello married a polish princess the 
jagiellonian dynasty ruled until 1569 when the two nations joined 
in a commonwealth that lasted until russia took over in 1795 
members of the lithuanian community in the polish town of punsk 
which lies near the border put up lithuanian and polish flags 
after watching the independence declaration on television the 
state news agency pap reported 
in his message walesa raised the issue of the fate of 260000 
poles living in lithuania who now are seeking greater access to 
their cultural heritage long denied under the republics previous 
communist leaders 
italy expressed hope that soviet and lithuanian authorities 
would be able to peacefully iron out their differences over the 
republic 
the italian government which has never recognized the 
annexation of lithuania by the soviet union salutes the 
declaration of independence foreign ministry spokesman giovanni 
castellaneta said in a statement

to accept it without confrontation

presidency of this indian ocean republic in an election to replace 
his slain predecessor final results showed monday 
however his opponent in sundays runoff charged fraud and 
immediately challenged the outcome 
the elections became necessary when president ahmed abdallah 
abderrahmane was assassinated nov 26 french mercenary bob denard 
took control of the island but he yielded to popular protests and 
arriving french troops by giving up power the following month 
denard widely blamed for killing the president has denied the 
accusation 
djohar said saturday he hopes south africa which has granted 
denard temporary refuge will extradite him to face a trial for the 
slaying no extradition treaty exists between the countries 
the national election commission said monday that djohar who 
was serving as interim president of the comoro republic won a 
sevenyear term with 55 percent of the vote his opponent mohamed 
taki gained 45 percent 
final results gave djohar 102882 votes compared with 83250 
for taki 
however taki claimed he was deprived of 30000 votes by fraud 
at 15 polling stations the complaints must be considered by this 
nations supreme court 
taki leader of the comoran union for democracy won the most 
votes in last weeks firstround elections with 24 percent of the 
ballots cast djohar gained 23 percent 
the remaining six opposition candidates had split their support 
between djohar and taki for the runoff 
taki declared less than four hours after polls opened sunday 
that he would demand the results be scrapped he said his 
supporters were harassed and their ballots confiscated 
beatings incomplete voter rolls and missing ballots forced 
djohar to annul the original first round of elections on feb 14

commanded the presidential guard giving him effective control of 
the republic 
the south african government said it hopes to be rid of denard

a congress of ethnic estonians on 
monday demanded an exact deadline for ending the occupation and 
illegal annexation of the republic of estonia as the first step 
toward restoring its independence 
the parliament of another soviet baltic republic lithuania 
declared its independence from the soviet union on sunday 
estonia has no need to do that because this land of 16 million 
residents is already an independent though occupied country said 
tunne kelam a leader of the movement to create the congress 
trivimi velliste a founder of the citizens movement declared 
we want moscow now to recognize the expression of the will of the 
estonian people our main aim is to establish our legal position of 
an occupied country 
estonians are using different tactics from the lithuanians to 
restore the statehood both enjoyed between the world wars because 
only 60 percent of its population is ethnic estonian the rest are 
largely russians who have migrated to the area since it was 
forcibly annexed in 1940 and many of them prefer to remain part of 
the soviet union 
lithuania is still 80 percent lithuanian and support there for 
independence is overwhelming 
estonian activists registered 700000 ethnic estonians who last 
month elected 465 representatives to the new congress which 
convened over the weekend activists say this organization is the 
true legislature not the supreme soviet parliament that will be 
elected sunday by all the soviet citizens of estonia 
the twoday session that ended monday demanded that moscow 
withdraw all soviet troops and immediately cease kgb activity in 
estonia the group also wants soviet military bases abolished 
velliste said the soviet union has 150000 soldiers in estonia 
or about one of every 10 people he said more are coming here as 
they are withdrawn from eastern europe 
some of them are situated only 50 kilometers 31 miles east 
of tallinn and forced to camp out in tents for lack of space he 
said 
velliste said his group would be willing to negotiate on troop 
withdrawal 
a declaration that described all state authorities of the 
estonian soviet socialist republic as only administrative organs 
for the occupation was read out to tumultuous applause 
however the congress voted to restore good neighborly relations 
with the soviet union on the basis of mutually beneficial 
cooperation and respect for each others rights 
velliste said estonians do not fear the consequences 
he asked what else can they do to us we have experienced 
everything we have experienced mass deportations and killings in 
the stalinist regime 
congress delegates elected a 78member council to conduct talks 
with moscow and foreign nations for recognition of complete 
independence 
the congress has the sole legitimate power now in estonia the 
supreme soviet will have no official position said kelam who is 
expected to be elected council chairman 
however delegates said the new 105member supreme soviet 
parliament to be elected next sunday would play a role in 
cooperating with the council in the transition period 
after we get guarantees from moscow about the withdrawal of 
troops we will hold parliamentary elections and form the first 
democratically elected government of an independent estonia 
velliste said in an interview 
we shall have that government by the end of 1991 maybe even 
sooner 
volunteers guarded the congress entrance after a breakin at 
congress headquarters and purported attempts by members of the 
largely russian group interfront to sabotage the meeting 
fortythree nonvoting members at the congress represented 
35000 nonestonians who said they want to be citizens of 
independent estonia when the new government is established

the vow of celibacy taken by roman catholic 
priests and nuns was one reason they were sought as potential 
subjects for an experimental aids vaccine developed by dr jonas 
salk a researcher said monday 
the researcher katharine munson also said it was archbishop 
roger mahonys idea to suggest an age of 65 or older in a jan 25 
letter to 3500 priests and nuns telling them that volunteers were 
needed 
mahony however denied sunday that anyone suggested to him that 
catholic clergy were being sought because of their celibate lives 
youre really looking for people who have a commitment to 
humankind and willingness to take risks to benefit others he 
said 
munson clinical director of the study at the university of 
southern californias norris cancer institute said the program was 
in no special need of candidates and has already been contacted by 
hundreds of people 
salk works at the la jolla calif institute that bears his 
name but the aids research is to be done at the norris clinic 
on monday the us food and drug administration approved 
expanded testing of the vaccine outside california 
reached at his home monday salk declined to comment on the 
study if i start giving interviews there will be no end to 
it said the 75yearold physician who in the 1950s created the 
first polio vaccine pronounced safe and effective 
munson said the vaccine salk hiv immunogen is being 
administered to 90 volunteers who have already tested positive for 
the virus that causes acquired immune deficiency syndrome 
in the next phase of testing 10 volunteers without the virus 
will be given the vaccine munson said she didnt know whether any 
of those being interviewed were roman catholic clergy 
the prototype salk vaccine is the only one among several being 
developed from the whole aids virus critics say that if live 
strains of the virus contaminate the vaccine volunteers could be 
accidentally infected 
researchers are trying to find out whether the inactivated virus 
used in the vaccine will cause the body to produce specific cells 
called t cells that destroy other cells infected with the virus 
munson said priests and nuns were sought as volunteers because 
in groups of people who have taken a vow of celibacy there are 
likely to be fewer people who get involved in sexual activity 
one of the ways aids is transmitted 
in this way researchers could be certain that if the test 
subjects developed the disease it would have been caused by a 
faulty vaccine she said 
munson agreed the appeal was also to priests and nuns who live 
an altruistic lifestyle and help aids patients 
it wasnt our decision to ask for people who are 65 said 
munson the archbishop put that in the letter if it the 
vaccine is ineffective someone might want to be older rather than 
young 
the age is not our standard each person young or old will 
be screened she said 
mahony said dr brian e henderson director of norris told him 
at their last meeting a few weeks ago that about six nuns had 
contacted the doctor as well as one or two priests 
the study is being conducted under a california law that permits 
such experiments without fda approval as long as all the materials 
are made in california 
munson said the second phase of the test injecting people who 
have tested negative for the virus awaits state approval salk 
said he will inject himself with the drug when testing is approved 
volunteer candidates had been calling regularly at the rate of 
five to 15 a day munson said adding that more calls were coming 
following the publicity the program received over the weekend 
while roman catholic officials insisted there was nothing more 
to mahonys letter than passing on information on behalf of 
henderson some medical ethicists wondered whether church politics 
was behind the move 
the roman catholic church has come under a lot of criticism 
from the aids community who have called it an obstacle to 
education an obstacle to the distribution of contraceptives 
said arthur caplan a medical ethicist at the university of 
minnesota 
to see the church participating in a vaccine trial carries 
with it a political as well as an ethical message he said 
there are many dangerous diseases for which there are such 
programs i dont think its an accident that this letter went out 
about aids

a concrete ceiling collapsed onto a food shop 
monday at the landmark ansonia hotel killing a woman and injuring 
12 others authorities said 
the collapse in the croissant amp co shop on the ground floor of 
the upper west side hotel on broadway between 73rd and 74th streets 
occurred about 350 pm 
the ceiling had been perforated with holes for pipes installed 
by various tenants over the years said buildings commissioner 
charles smith said a suspended ceiling had been added and the 
combined weight apparently caused the collapse he said 
its an old ceiling decorative molding heavy plaster with 
metal leaves holding it all together it just gave way smith 
said 
we were drinking coffee all of a sudden water started rushing 
above and the ceiling collapsed according to one young woman who 
was interviewed outside 
we felt the vibration we thought the building was falling 
first it was like a vibration then glass breaking and then a big 
boom said elvin rodriguez a clerk at a nearby bookstore 
when he went outside rodriguez said a street vendor had 
already run and started pulling people out 
fire department spokesman john mulligan said the collapsed area 
measured 250 square feet and weighed about 2 tons the woman who 
was killed was dressed in street clothes and apparently was not an 
employee he said 
as it collapsed the ceiling dragged the sprinkler system down 
with it prompting initial reports that a water leak above the shop 
apparently weakened the ceiling and sent it crashing onto the 
patrons in the shop 
eleven people were taken to hospitals and one person declined 
medical aid authorities said three of those taken to hospitals 
suffered head injuries 
construction was taking place on the second floor of the 
17story building when the collapse occurred said efrain parrilla 
a fire department spokesman 
fire crews later began tearing down the ceiling to make it safe 
for searchers dogs also were being used to search debris 
a flower shop next door the rose boutique which has a similar 
ceiling was ordered closed and evacuated as a precaution 
the ansonia is one of new yorks architectural gems according 
to the american institute of architects new york guidebook the 
heavily ornamented residential building was built in 1904 and was a 
residence hotel for enrico caruso arturo toscanini lily pons 
florenz ziegfeld theodore dreiser sol hurok igor stravinsky and 
babe ruth among other celebrities 
arts figures favored the hotel because it was well soundproofed 
although unintentionally it also was featured in such movies as 
three days of the condor and the sunshine boys

new president patricio aylwin pledged 
respect for human rights monday in a speech to a huge gathering 
celebrating the rebirth of democracy in chile but indicated he 
will avoid holding trials for past abuses 
singing flagwaving sometimes weeping chileans packed the 
82000seat national stadium five miles southeast of downtown 
santiago to hear aylwin a site that long served as a dark symbol 
of bloody political repression 
aylwin a 71yearold centrist christian democrat became 
president sunday ending 16 years of authoritarian rule by 
rightwing gen augusto pinochet 
on seizing power in a violent 1973 coup pinochet launched a 
harsh antileftist campaign thousands of suspected dissidents were 
rounded up and brought to national stadium where human rights 
groups say many were tortured and some were executed 
aylwin appeared on monday to rule out vigorous prosecution and 
punishment of military officers for abuses committed during 
pinochets rule 
he remarked at mondays evening rally that in sorrowful days 
of blind and hateful predominance of force over reason it the 
stadium was a place of confinement and torture for many 
compatriots 
from this place we say to all chileans and the world that 
is watching us never again never again violations of human 
dignity 
aylwin promised to clarify the truth about the disappearances 
of people the horrendous crimes and other grave human rights 
violations that occurred during the dictatorship 
but he called for tempering the virtue of justice with the 
virtue of prudence and said a time for forgiveness would 
come 
chile he said must avoid becoming engulged indefinitely in 
inquiries recriminations and witchhunts 
the issue is seen as one of the most politically sensitive to be 
faced by aylwins administration 
pinochet 74 keeps command of the 60000member army and has 
said he will not permit the new government to prosecute military 
officers for past offenses 
rights organizations and leftist groups many of which supported 
aylwins candidacy are pressing for the trial and punishment of 
offenders 
according to rights groups at least 700 people disappeared 
during pinochets rule they say thousands more were illegally 
imprisoned and many of them were tortured 
aylwin appealed on monday for patience saying there will be 
difficulties because of obstacles and binds left behind for us by 
the former regime 
pinochet enacted lastminute laws and decrees trimming aylwins 
powers and granting the military virtual autonomy the new 
government plans to eliminate or modify many of the laws but 
acknowledges this will slow down its efforts to address social 
needs 
a roar of applause greeted aylwin as he entered the stadium 
wearing the red white and blue presidential sash and accompanied 
by his wife leonor 
he sat down among visiting heads of state and watched an 
emotionally charged folk ceremony 
relatives of people who disappeared during military rule staged 
a funeral dance and then marched across an open brightly lighted 
soccer field in folk costumes they held up postersized 
photographs of the victims whose names scrolled down the 
electronic scoreboard many had last been seen in the stadium 
many people wept openly in the stands

president christos sartzetakis dissolved 
parliament on monday and greeces political parties prepared for 
their third battle after two inconclusive elections since june 
a presidential decree posted next to parliaments entrance 
disbanded the 300member legislature and scheduled elections for 
april 8 
the conservative new democracy party with 148 seats in the last 
parliament is aiming for a majority in the elections the 
socialists with 128 seats and the communists with 21 appear 
determined to prevent this three seats went to independents in 
november 
premier xenophon zolotas will lead a caretaker government until 
the elections he was appointed by the conservative socialist and 
communist parties to head an allparty government after nov 5 
elections but on feb 12 that government broke up citing policy 
differences 
zolotas had a mandate to tackle pressing economic problems he 
was expected to take drastic action in tackling a 12billion 
publicsector deficit 
his government succeeded in cutting spending by about 6 billion 
but did not raise revenues 
in june elections new democracy beat former premier andreas 
papandreous panhellenic socialist movement which had been in 
power eight years 
new democracy formed a coalition with the communists and 
indicted papandreou and several other senior socialists on 
corruption charges 
no trial dates were set and a strong showing by the socialists 
in november resulted in new democracy again falling just short of a 
parliamentary majority 
recent opinion polls do not show any significant swing in party 
strengths but new democracy leader constantine mitsotakis says he 
will no longer cooperate with other parties 
you cant wage a battle with three field marshals he told a 
campaign rally on lesbos island sunday 
however the communistled coalition of the left and progress 
reeling after the revolutionary changes in eastern europe has 
indicated it would form an alliance with the socialists 
the communists hinted last weekend they may field joint 
candidates with the socialists in the five singleseat 
constituencies that are traditionally the key to parliamentary 
power 
given present party strengths though a socialistcommunist 
alliance would hold only a slight parliamentary majority such a 
government would have trouble making unpopular decisions

prominent black americans urged secretary of 
state james a baker iii on monday to provide up to 25 million in 
us aid to a leading antiapartheid group in south africa 
the idea is to help the african national congress begin planning 
a new political structure for the country randall robinson 
executive director of transafrica said 
he cited as precedents us assistance to the polish labor 
movement solidarity and to the nicarguan coalition headed by 
violeta chamorro before they took control of their countries 
robinson said bakers response at a 45minute state department 
meeting was noncommital at the same time the transafrica 
official said baker disagreed with some sharpness to a request 
to end us support for unita insurgents in angola 
the black group had asked baker to recognize the angolan 
government now that more than half the cuban troops have departed 
robinson said supporting unita headed by jonas savimbi puts 
the united states in league with south africa 
the black visitors and baker found themselves in accord on 
several other issues for instance robinson said the bush 
administration will not ease economic sanctions against south 
africa and it will work with the soviet union and other nations to 
try to help the hungry in ethiopia 
unless channels for delivering food are opened quickly some 3 
million ethiopians could starve robinson said 
the black group proposed that president bush ask soviet 
president mikhail s gorbachev cooperate in seeking a ceasefire in 
the african country between the marxist government and separatist 
eritrean rebels 
robinson said israel should be asked to stop arming the 
government and arab countries to stop aiding the rebels baker 
agreed to propose the plan to president bush robinson said 
the delegation included the rev jesse jackson mrs coretta 
scott king former mayor richard hatcher of gary ind and joseph 
lowery head of the southern christian leadership conference 
baker leaves sunday to attend indepndence ceremonies in namibia 
a former south african colony he may also meet with leaders of the 
south african government and black opposition groups 
robinson called the 500000 in us aid for namibia this year 
paltry and suggested 15 million baker did not commit himself 
robinson said 
for next year the bush administration has proposed 78 million 
for namibia

sen edward kennedy said monday he 
expects the new democratic government to allow prosecution of two 
military officers for the 1976 bombslaying of a prominent chilean 
dissident in washington 
the massachusetts democrat sponsored a 14yearold congressional 
ban on military weapons sales to chile it can only be lifted when 
the 1976 assassination of orlando letelier is cleared up 
i believe the overwhelming majority of the members of the 
senate of both parties the republican and democratic want 
those involved in governmentsponsored terrorism brought to 
justice whether here in chile or the united states kennedy told 
a news conference there is every expectation they will 
since arriving saturday kennedy has met with many top officials 
in the new government of president patricio aylwin the elected 
civilian took power sunday to end 16 years of rightwing military 
rule by gen augusto pinochet 
kennedy said it does not matter whether army gen manuel 
contreras and army col pedro espinoza both formerly top officials 
in pinochets secret police are tried in chile or the united 
states 
contreras and espinoza were among several former secret police 
implicated in the killing of letelier he died along with an 
american assistant when a remotecontrol bomb blew up his car as it 
rounded dupont circle on washingtons embassy row on sept 21 1976 
chilean jurists and human rights officials say they consider it 
extremely unlikely contreras or espinoza will ever face trial in a 
us court despite indictments in washington the chilean supreme 
court rejected a us request for their extradition in 1979 
letelier was a us ambassador and held several cabinet posts in 
the leftist government of elected president salvador allende who 
was toppled by pinochet in a 1973 coup

national performing arts center on the banks of the potomac river

former hariet mayor to a small ceremony in an opera house lounge 
as ugly as i am i think its wonderful he said of the bust by 
sculptor gretta bader of stanford calif 
fulbright recalled that he accompanied the soviet ambassador to 
a performance of the bolshoi ballet in a local movie theater in 
1957 the theater was such a bad locale he said that he 
introduced legislation the next day authorizing a national cultural 
center in washington 
after congress approved the bill in 1958 kennedy center 
officials said fulbright provided extraordinary energy and 
leadership during a turbulent period when questions of financial 
support construction site architectural design and administration 
of the center were debated 
roger l stevens founding chairman of the kennedy center who 
celebrated his 80th birthday monday said fulbrights role had 
never been fully recognized if it had not been for people like 
him we would never have succeeded in making the kennedy center a 
reality he said 
fulbright said the center represents the extremely important 
role that the arts play in humanizing our society

memorial to john f kennedy who was assassinated in 1963

federal regulators should think about moving 
stock trading off exchange floors to computer screens a report to 
congress said monday the regulators said they werent convinced 
the general accounting office the auditing and investigative 
agency of congress said the securities and exchange commission 
should consider a proposal to repeal a new york stock exchange rule 
requiring trades of most listed stocks to be executed on the 
exchange floor 
a rule that forbids afterhours trading of listed stocks which 
tends to push afterhours trading to foreign exchanges also should 
be reviewed the report said 
trading rules were eased in 1979 to permit offfloor trading of 
newly listed stocks but a decade later most stocks still were 
initially listed before 1979 trades of 89 of the new york stock 
exchanges 100 most active shares still must be routed through the 
exchange floor 
the gao noting the rapid evolution of computer and 
communications technology said it is time for the commission to 
reconsider rules banning most offfloor trading 
the commission disagreed saying its 1979 study of offfloor 
trading was complex and that it would not dismantle the floor 
system until market participants determine a new system would be 
better than the old 
on the new york stock exchange the nations principal exchange 
brokers bring orders to a specific spot on the floor designated for 
trading in the stock they are buying or selling 
there they must deal by open outcry with other floor 
brokers if there are any if there are none others the broker 
seeking to trade may deal with a specialist another broker 
charged by the exchange with standing ready to buy or sell at all 
times 
critics contend that the use of trading floors and specialists 
restricts price competition 
supporters of the current system however argue that a central 
location for trading preserves the benefits of an auction market 
in trading by computer a broker lists bids or offerings on a 
screen for others to accept or reject changing prices as he or she 
sees fit 
the sec agreed that a review of afterhours trading was in order 
even though in 1986 the commission rejected a recommendation from 
its staff that the agency ask the new york stock exchange to 
consider it 
as a result exchange member brokers and dealers who wish 
to trade exchangelisted stocks when us markets are closed must 
do so in foreign markets the gao said 
the report dated monday was delivered to the senate banking 
committee and the house energy and commerce committee

western european governments are under 
pressure from public opinion to cut their military forces 
drastically dutch defense minister aurelus ter beek told defense 
secretary richard cheney monday 
all ministers of defense have to take the heat in this way 
he told reporters later all ministers of defense do feel 
pressures from public opinion on them to achieve drastic cuts 
ter beek belongs to the labor party in the netherlands which 
like other social democratic groups traditionally puts less 
emphasis on defense than do conservative parties 
he warned cheney against too long a delay in calling a second 
conference on reductions in forces after the one now going on in 
vienna 
some or several countries might be tempted or even forced to 
lead the way he said 
he noted that the us government is hoping for an agreement in 
general terms by june he himself would like to see a formal treaty 
in the second half of the year 
ter beek said that the parties in his own coalition government 
have agreed to find about 15 billion in reductions of military 
spending in the next five years he said a paper on the countrys 
defense in the 1990s will be issued at the end of the year 
he went on to say that he prefers to make cuts in the present 
framework of 23 governments including the united states 
european countries will of course be interested in the best 
way the american commitment to the defense of europe can be 
symbolized after a partial withdrawal of american troops he 
said 
he said other countries have accepted the two plus four 
formula under which the two germanys will negotiate unification 
followed by talks with the four main victors of world war ii the 
united states the soviet union britain and france 
but he called for close consultations on other subjects such as 
the number of soviet troops who will remain in eastern europe the 
value of the warsaw pact after free elections in its member 
countries the future of foreign troops in west germany including 
the present dutch brigade the future strategy of the alliance and 
the role of nuclear weapopns in it 
the stationing of troops should be a decision of the north 
atlantic alliance he said 
ter beeks message on consultations was similar to the one 
brought to washington last week by italian prime minister giulio 
andreotti

christies changed a longstanding policy monday 
and guaranteed a minimum price to the sellers of vincent van goghs 
self portrait and four other paintings being auctioned on may 
15 
the auction house said the paintings by van gogh pierreauguste 
renoir amedeo modigliani and henri de toulouselautrec have been 
given a presale estimate of 40 million to 60 million with van 
goghs work valued at between 20 million and 30 million 
the heirs of financier and art collector robert lehman who are 
offering the paintings for sale will be guaranteed a minimum price 
regardless of the bids offered the auction house said the minimum 
was not disclosed 
the firms concern about the possible negative impact of 
guaranteed sales on the art market is wellknown the auction 
house said in a statement however christies is aware of the 
guarantees appeal to certain client segments 
christies managing director christopher davidge said that 
during the past year we have in certain cases found it difficult 
to compete for art sellers business without offering 
guarantees 
thus christies has in this case decided to guarantee he 
said 
davidge would not say how often christies planned to offer 
guarantees to other sellers 
christies has long criticized rival auction house sothebys for 
making guarantees saying the practice can artificially inflate the 
art market guarantees particularly when they are not announced 
can also give an auction house a conflict of interest

two brothers charged with killing 
their millionaire parents delayed entering pleas monday to give 
their lawyers time to review the seizure of evidence from the 
brothers psychologist 
attorneys for erik and lyle menendez said they wanted to 
determine if tape recordings seized from jerome oziel were 
inadmissible in court in what appears to be a key issue developing 
in the case 
the concern is that it is my understanding that when you 
talk to a therapist that thats privileged as if you were 
talking to a lawyer and that privilege might be breached said 
defense attorney gerald chaleff 
the tapes of conversations between oziel and the brothers were 
seized last thursday the day police arrested lyle 22 and 
launched an international search for erik 19 a tennis pro who 
surrendered over the weekend 
district attorney ira reiner called the tapes key evidence 
in the aug 20 1989 shotgun slayings of hollywood executive jose 
menendez 45 and mary louise kitty menendez 44 
reiner alleged that money was the motive in the killings the 
brothers who reported finding their parents bodies in their 
beverly hills mansion stood to inherit the 14 million estate of 
jose menendez a successful executive of live entertainment inc a 
los angelesbased video distribution company 
defense attorneys said they wanted to read the search warrant 
affidavit that authorities filed before they searched oziels 
office the affidavit which may indicate what is on the tapes 
were ordered sealed by the judge to everyone except attorneys in 
the case 
state law allows a psychologists patient records to be used as 
evidence if there is a threat of continued violence and deputy 
district attorney elliot alhadeff said oziel was threatened 
alhadeff would not elaborate and oziel declined to return a 
phone message to his beverly hills office 
chaleff said he had no information of a threat against the 
psychologist or anyone else 
the menendez brothers arraignment was rescheduled for march 26 
when they will enter pleas and municipal court judge judith o 
stein will decide whether to release the affidavit 
attorneys and the prosecutor discussed the affidavit and other 
matters behind closed doors monday for more than an hour before the 
brothers appeared in court 
the brothers listened to stein read the charges against them 
two counts of murder with special circumstance allegations that 
could make them eligible for the death penalty if they are 
convicted 
when asked if they understood the charges the brothers each 
answered yes your honor 
sitting in the courtroom were maria llanio the mother of victim 
jose menendez and joses sister teresita baralt and her husband 
carlos the baralts are executors of the menendez estate 
family members declined to comment but defense attorney robert 
shapiro said family members are united in support of both these 
boys 
reiner in a news conference prior to the brothers court 
appearance insisted that the taped conversations were not the only 
evidence his office had in the case 
he said there was other physical evidence which he would 
not identify

nicaraguan president daniel ortega 
promised vice president dan quayle monday he will peacefully 
relinquish power april 25 quayle said 
ortega confirming the commitment said he told quayle the best 
way to ensure a peaceful transfer of power was that the contras 
cease to exist by april 25 and that quayle assured him the 
united states would seek ways of supporting the idea 
aides to the vice president said ortega was referring to an 
expected us aid package that would among other things provide 
funds for resettling the rebel fighters 
ortega also assured the vice president that all cabinet 
ministers including the defense minister and interior minister in 
charge of the sandinistadominated army and police will be 
appointed by violeta chamorro the usbacked candidate who beat 
ortega in the feb 25 election quayle said 
ortega sought out quayle at a 1hour lunch hosted by newly 
inaugurated chilean president patricio aylwin in the presidential 
palace after arranging in two brief earlier chats to talk further 
later in the day quayle flew to asuncion for an 18hour visit 
the first in 32 years by a highranking us official to paraguay 
a dictatorship until 1989 quayle was met by an honor guard and 
president gen andres rodriguez under a giant redandwhite banner 
of welcome 
two hours after quayles arrival members of a halfdozen 
leftist groups gathered on a downtown street to wave antiquayle 
signs and listen to speeches denouncing imperlialism police 
watched but did not intervene 
before leaving santiago quayle told reporters his talk with 
ortega had been cordial and productive 
he guaranteed me two things quayle said one on april 25 
he will turn over his presidency to violetta chamorro two he 
guaranteed to me that violetta chamorro will appoint all ministers 
including the defense minister and the interior minister 
ortega also asked that the bush administration immediately lift 
the economic sanctions imposed by the united states during his 
sandinista regime said other officials who briefed reporters on 
condition of anonymity 
quayle assured him the administration already was actively 
considering the same request made by mrs chamorro the officials 
said 
meanwhile administration sources in washington said bush will 
ask congress for a quick 300 million to support chamorro sources 
declining to be named publicly said that bush is expected to 
announce the request as early as tuesday the proposal would 
include some 30 million to help relocate the contra rebels into 
their homeland they said 
quayles aides said that while ortega has said repeatedly the 
contras must be disbanded before power is to be transferred he did 
not make that a condition to his monday promise of peaceful 
transition 
quayle himself did not answer a question on whether ortega 
imposed any conditions but his aides later repeated what they said 
before that ortega had not 
ortega himself encountering reporters in his hotel said i 
commited to him that the process of transfer of power was going to 
take place with the utmost normality the best thing for that 
purpose would be that the contras cease to exist by april 25 
quayle said ortega told him i want to make the transfer in 
nicaragua more peaceful than the transfer in chile where a 
civilian government was inaugurated over the weekend to bring a 
16year military dictatorship to a peaceful end 
officials traveling with quayle said the vice president brought 
up possible use of united nations peacekeeping troops to help 
prevent outbreaks of fighting between the contra rebels and 
sandinista loyqlists 
ortega indicated that would be fine if they are willing to 
take the risk the aides said they quoted quayle as replying 
we better take a risk for peace 
the luncheon conversation took place after ortega walked up and 
asked costa rican president oscar arias who was seated next to 
quayle to trade places with him 
ortega later characterized the discussion as frank friendly 
and constructive he had previously made a strong point of 
insisting that the contras be demobilized at once 
the us position also favors disbanding the rebel army but the 
bush administration has insisted the rebels be given security 
guarantees before they lay down their arms 
the occasion of the inauguration set the stage for an 
unprecedented faceoff quayle holding official talks with the 
sandinista leader the united states had shunned for a decade 
their meeting in moneda the official presidential palace came 
as a new wave of diplomacy on nicaragua picked up steam several 
heads of state used the inauguration to discuss how to bring a 
peaceful transition of power following the election ortega lost to 
mrs chamorro 
arias joined ortega in announcing that a meeting of central 
american presidents will be held at the end of the month to discuss 
ways to bring about a smooth and peaceful transition in managua 
quayle and ortega were joined in a 10minute session by 
venezuelan president carlos andres perez 
perez told quayle in ortegas presence that ortega had 
assured him he would hand over power to mrs chamorro even if the 
contra issue is not resolved said a quayle aide the assistant 
briefed reporters on the condition that he not be publicly 
identified 
this aide however also quoted quayle telling ortega you 
cant make unilateral emobilization of the contras a precondition 
for the transfer of power 
the aide said the vice president also complained about 
sandinista helicopter attacks on contras observing a ceasefire 
after first chatting at mass quayle and ortega met at a lunch 
hosted by aylwin it was the first such highlevel official us 
discussion with the nicaraguan leftist 
arias said that quayle concurred when arias suggested the 
contras should receive no us money to repatriate until they lay 
down their arms 
what i said to him was unless the contras disarm they 
shouldnt get any money for their repatriation thats a good 
carrot for them arias told reporters as he left a hotel where 
he met the vice presidents 
he agreed with me arias said of quayle 
but quayles chief of staff bill kristol later said quayle 
agreed only that there should be incentives for the contras to 
disband not that they should disarm or lose repatriation money 
the incentives kristol said will be in the nicaraguan aid 
package the administration is scheduled to announce later this 
week and the chief of staff said quayle insisted there be security 
guarantees for the contras 
the united states has avoided high level contacts with ortega 
holding that his government should negotiate with the contras 
directly rather than with the united states 
at the venezuelan inauguration last year quayle stayed away 
from ortega 
when president bush and ortega were together in a multilateral 
session at last octobers celebration of costa rican democracy 
bush also avoided any substantive talk with the nicaraguan 
he referred to him later as a little man who was trying to 
sidle up for a photo opportunity with the american president

los angeles raiders owner al davis said 
monday he wants to bring the national football league team back to 
the city he abandoned eight years ago 
davis breaking a long silence on the issue called local 
officials to lend his support to oaklands offer 
the proposal which guarantees davis raiders 602 million over 
15 years now needs only the approval of the city council and 
alameda county supervisors 
hes ready and were ready said mayor lionel wilson 
this is an eventful day in history for this city 
the separate votes were scheduled for monday night following a 
hearing but the possibility that testimony would be lengthy 
threatened to force a vote postponement 
if davis the raiders managing general partner had said no 
monday or failed to call by a noon deadline the deal would have 
been off 
the nfl formally requires approval by threefourths of team 
owners of any move as well as written notification by jan 15 of 
the year of the proposed relocation but in practice the league 
poses no further obstacles if the city and county approve the offer 
davis moved the raiders from oakland to los angeles without 
permission and won his case in court and robert irsay moved the 
colts without approval from baltimore to indianapolis in 1984 nfl 
owners did approve the 1988 transfer of the cardinals franchise 
from st louis to phoenix 
the raiders lease with the los angeles memorial coliseum runs 
through the 1991 season but its possible davis could seek a 
settlement enabling him to return to oakland sooner 
officials in los angeles worked through the weekend to put 
together a counteroffer but were pessimistic about their chances 
it looks like were going to lose the raiders said ed 
snider lead negotiator for the los angeles coliseums private 
managers its a damn shame i havent given up but i fear were 
a day late and a dollar short 
oaklands offer includes a loan package totaling 121 million to 
the team it proposes 535 million to renovate the oakland 
coliseum and the rest a loan davis does not have to repay 
davis also would be guaranteed ticket revenues of at least 29 
million a year for the life of the 15year lease he would receive 
the basic 30 ticket price from at least 57000 seats with the 
city and county taking the premium payments above that for certain 
categories of seats 
he also would keep all television which currently is 32 
million a year 
for the city and county to make money the team must average 90 
percent of capacity in a renovated coliseum that will hold 63500 
about 37000 seats will cost more than the 30 base ticket price 
many require fans to pay 2000 to 16000 up front 
in light of those requirements many local officials question 
whether there are enough sports fan dollars in the bay area to 
support another pro team 
this deal is a gamble not worth getting into said city 
councilman wilson riles jr the risks are just too high 
if the raiders return they must compete with three championship 
professional teams the oakland athletics san francisco 49ers and 
san francisco giants and a fourth the warriors that routinely 
sells out

a local radio stations program director 
admitted monday his tale of hiring an unemployed draftsman who 
advertised his job search on a boston billboard was a hoax 
ron valeri programming director for radio station waaf said he 
and others at the station lied repeatedly in a bid to outdo their 
local radio competitor radio station wbcn 
but valeri said the publicity stunt which ran on the associated 
press wire and garnered national attention ran amok we did 
definitely lose control this thing got away from us he said 
valeri and his new employee bill whiteman told interviewers 
from various local and national news organizations that the disc 
jockey was hired because of his eyecatching plea on a boston 
billboard help i need a job 
the billboard ad did go up but valeri admitted monday that he 
knew of whitemans prior experience as a broadcaster at radio 
station wrck in utica ny a couple of weeks before he 
discussed the hiring with reporters 
initially waaf set up a publicity stunt in an attempt to 
bamboozle its competitor we were successful in doing that 
valeri said what we didnt count on at the time was that local 
media would jump on the story simultaneously 
calls to radio station wbcn the local competition against which 
the waaf stunt was aimed went unanswered monday evening

demonstrators threw sticks and stones at police 
during a protest monday night at a london borough hall over 
britains new tax officials said several people were injured 
including some officers and 45 were arrested police said 
protests have been occurring around britain over the new tax 
which will fund locally controlled spending the uproar over the 
tax has contributed to a slide in the popularity of prime minister 
margaret thatchers conservative government 
three hundred police some on horseback confronted about 1500 
protesters in the northeast london borough of islington monday as 
the area council met to set the local tax rate 
police said 20 or 30 people started to snake through the crowd 
and push demonstrators into police lines 
then sticks and stones were thrown at the mounted police as 
police reinforcements went into the crowd said an unidentified 
senior officer 
the majority of the crowd were engaged in noisy but peaceful 
protest said police commander david stevens but a minority 
were taking part in violent protest 
several policemen and demonstrators were injured authorities 
said they said they arrested 45 
inside the hall council leader margaret hodge told the meeting 
local retirees had been afraid to come express their views for fear 
of violence it was a sad day for democracy she said 
her speech relayed outside was continually interrupted by 
about 50 people in the halls public gallery they threw toilet 
paper and paper airplanes into the chamber 
the new tax takes effect april 1 in england and wales the new 
percapita levy replaces a household tax called the rates 
the government calls the new tax the community charge but 
the socialist opposition labor party and other critics have dubbed 
it the poll tax after a percapita tax that set off a peasants 
revolt in 1381 
the government pushed through the new tax with a mind to 
embarrassing laborcontrolled local councils by making them more 
accountable for their spending however the move has backfired 
with opposition to the tax riding high the conservative party 
is trailing labor by up to 19 points in opinion polls the next 
general election is due by mid1992 
lowincome and disabled people can get rebates of up to 80 
percent on the next tax but critics say the new tax is unfair 
because it otherwise takes no account of an individuals ability to 
pay 
the new tax is already in force in scotland with widespread 
protest there northern ireland a british province has a separate 
system of local funding

portauprince haiti ap deposed ruler lt gen prosper 
avril flew to florida in exile monday and the army caved in to 
civilian opposition demands that he be replaced with the first 
woman president in haitis troubled history 
in a ceremony at army headquarters carried on haitian state 
television opposition leaders gave the army high command a letter 
nominating supreme court justice ertha pascaltrouillot 46 as 
provisional president 
maj gen herard abraham the army chief of staff to whom avril 
handed control after resigning saturday said he hoped to turn over 
power by tuesday so that the people can have a government of 
their choice 
i am very happy that the haitian people with their army were 
able to achieve this said abraham who appeared on a 
secondfloor balcony of army headquarters with opposition leaders 
he did not mention mrs pascaltrouillot by name but clearly 
indicated the army accepted her nomination to lead haiti the 
western hemispheres poorest country 
wild cheers broke out from the crowd which chanted liberty 
liberty 
excluding avril and lt gen henri namphy who assumed power 
when dictator jeanclaude duvalier fled to france four years ago 
haiti has had 38 presidents nearly all military since 1804 
haiti the first slave nation to become independent has also had 
two emperors one king and a governorgeneral the army wielded 
such political clout that the duvalier dynasty created the dread 
secret police the tonton macoutes to offbalance the regular army 
until now no civilian opposition has taken control of the 
government without the military playing a major role 
unity assembly the opposition coalition that put forward mrs 
pascaltrouillot announced on radio she would be inaugurated at 
the palace of justice at 10 am tuesday 
the coalition also said a general strike it called for monday 
before avril left this impoverished caribbean country of 51 
million residents would end at midnight 
the provisional government is to prepare haiti which shares the 
island of hispaniola with the dominican republic for national 
elections 
avril and his family arrived aboard a us c141 transport plane 
at homestead air force base 25 miles south of miami at 820 am 
and left at 330 pm destination unknown a us government 
official speaking on condition of anonymity said avril left florida 
avrils departure followed a week of political turmoil that left 
at least 24 people dead his military government ruled haiti 
often harshly for 18 months 
thousands of people milled about this capital city of 1 million 
which had been deserted before avrils departure because of the 
violence 
youths danced to meringue music featuring revolutionary themes 
such as the generals gone and uproot the killers the mood 
of the city however appeared to be one of disbelief not 
jubilation 
radio stations reported instances of youths building flaming 
barricades and pillaging a government food warehouse but the 
incidents were far from the bloody clashes of the previous seven 
days 
on monday the unity assembly an opposition coalition 
instrumental in avrils downfall submitted its choice of mrs 
pascaltrouillot the only woman on the 12member supreme court 
to the army high command unity members said abraham agreed to 
accept whoever they chose 
the interim president is to govern along with a 19member 
advisory council until elections are held possibly in three to six 
months 
the armys first choice had been supreme court chief justice 
gilbert austin an avril appointee but the unity assembly rejected 
him saying he was too closely tied to the deposed regime 
opposition leaders stood firm in three days of intense 
negotiations with the army and threatened further disruptions and 
strikes unless their choice for the presidency prevailed finally 
the army agreed to accept mrs pascaltrouillot austin was out of 
the picture as was anyone else deemed to be too closely associated 
with avril 
austin refused the presidency his wife said in a radio 
interview the people and the parties didnt want him so to not 
block the country he decided not to accept she said 
white house spokesman marlin fitzwater said the bush 
administration was hopeful for a smooth transition to democracy 
in haiti we are encouraging that effort 
he refused to say whether the united states will grant avril 
asylum 
fitzwater said the bush administration had discussions with 
avril about the transition there was a feeling of some 
obligation to help him leave and facilitate a peaceful transition 
sylvio claude a prominent haitian politician said it was too 
early to predict whether army hardliners would resist the transfer 
of power to a civilianled government 
last night there were lots of threats he said referring 
to fears by opposition leaders that soldiers might hunt them down 
haiti has been led mostly by military governments since 
independence from france 186 years ago including avril and namphy 
who assumed power when dictator baby doc duvalier fled in 
february 1986 
the army wielded such political clout that the duvalier dynasty 
created the dread secret police the tonton macoutes as a 
paramilitary force 
when duvalier fled into exile in france four years ago ending 
the 29year dynasty begun by his father the late francois papa 
doc hopes rose for democracy but the military held onto power 
avril took over in a september 1988 soldiers revolt against 
namphy under namphy the nations first free general elections 
were aborted when thugs protected by soldiers killed at least 34 
voters 
namphy organized armyrun fraudulent elections in january 1988 
in which university professor leslie manigat was declared the 
winner namphy ousted manigat five months later before suffering 
the same fate that september

an attorney for manuel antonio noriega said monday 
the government should release documents captured in panama that 
show the ousted dictator had helped the united states catch dozens 
of drug traffickers 
attorney steven kollin told us magistrate william turnoff he 
wants to see documents from the office of the panamanian 
investigative service that countrys equivalent of the fbi 
the documents have been under us government control since us 
forces deposed noriega in the december invasion of panama 
after the hearing kollin said the documents were important 
because they established that noriega and panamas defense forces 
had cooperated with the us drug enforcement administration and 
other law enforcement agencies up to the day of the invasion 
noriega is accused in a february 1988 federal indictment of 
running drugs and protecting colombian drug shipments to the united 
states between 1982 and 1986 
kollin said he was sure he would win access to the documents 
but may have to press harder to obtain a court order turnoff who 
has become a referee in a dispute between the government and 
noriega over the former generals personal property and papers did 
not rule monday on kollins request 
noriegas attorneys contend that prosecutors have been slow in 
producing his property for inspection while prosecutors say 
theyve been moving as fast as they can 
the government said monday it has completed an inventory of 
noriegas holdings and turned the lists over to the defense 
the court gave the defense four weeks to look over the inventory 
so noriegas attorneys can determine which of his belongings are 
available as evidence 
prosecutors said they will be turning over some items to the 
panamanian government that are not considered evidence 
kollin however protested contending that international law 
prohibits the confiscation of private property during an invasion 
the proper party to turn these over to is the legal 
representative meaning myself he said

lavon barve clung to the lead monday 
as frontrunners in the iditarod trail sled dog race began their 
run up the bering sea coast to nome 
barve of wasilla arrived at 402 pm in this windswept coastal 
community the final checkpoint before mushers head across the 
treacherous ice of norton bay 
once they get onto the ice they can expect sudden storms and 
an ample supply of wind said gail somerville an iditarod 
spokeswoman in anchorage 
threetime winner susan butcher of manley and defending champion 
joe runyan of nenana were trailing barve by just a couple of hours 
somerville said 
they havent checked in yet but theyre not too far behind 
she said 
tim osmar of clam gulch dee dee jonrowe of willow and rick 
swenson of two rivers the iditarods only fourtime champion had 
reached unalakleet the largest community on the trail between 
eagle river and nome 
barve driving 14 dogs was first out of unakleet at 1005 am 
but 50 miles earlier at kaltag he rested his team only 3 hours 
compared with eight hours for butcher and five hours for runyan 
he didnt seem to think that was much of a handicap however 
my dogs are getting stronger with less rest barve said i 
think thats my advantage my dogs always seem to recover fast 
butcher whose team had dropped to 12 dogs said she would like 
to be in front by the time the leaders reach white mountain just 
77 miles from the finish of the 1158mile race 
unfortunately thats not up to me as much as the other 
guys butcher said id like to shed them early but i dont 
know if thats possible 
and probably from what i know of lavons competitive spirit 
and how he can do what he wants to do with that team i may not 
shed them at all 
runyan said any one of the first five mushers could win the race 
in the last 170mile sprint to nome 
if you want to make a good bet never bet on a dog race he 
said its really shaken out to which team is healthy and really 
fit looks to me like its anybodys bet whats going on here 
before leaving kaltag runyan said the leaders in the 18th 
running of iditarod had come under the spell of what he called the 
crazy syndrome 
everybodys pushing pushing pushing he said 
since 70 teams left anchorage on march 3 seven mushers have 
scratched and another has been disqualified because of sick dogs 
the iditarod named for an abandoned goldmining town along the 
trail was started in 1973 to commemorate the 1925 emergency 
delivery of lifesaving diphtheria serum from anchorage to nome by 
sled dog teams

the soviet unions role in a new international 
development bank for eastern europe proved the major sticking point 
sunday when officials from 39 countries failed to reach agreement 
on terms for the institution 
the weekend meeting also broke up without a compromise on what 
currency will be used for the european bank for reconstruction and 
development where it will be located or how shareholdings will be 
balanced against voting rights 
the most difficult question is the eligibility of one country 
in particular said jacques attali an aide to french president 
francois mitterrand who proposed the bank in october 
it was a reference to the soviet union whose full participation 
in the bank has been opposed by the united states 
attali who presided over the talks affirmed that the soviet 
unions presence at the discussions meant it would have some future 
role he said the application of any country wishing to join would 
be considered 
israel egypt morocco south korea and lichtenstein took part 
in the talks for the first time adding to the original 34 western 
and eastern european countries and the united states and japan 
we have opened up the tellers window attali said the 
more countries that wish to support the revolutions in central and 
eastern europe the better 
at the first session in january held to set terms for the bank 
the united states ruled out soviet participation unless moscow made 
the ruble a convertible currency and began other market reforms 
the united states also says the soviet union hasnt gone as far 
toward democracy as other east european countries notably poland 
hungary and czechoslovakia the bank would also benefit yugoslavia 
east germany romania and bulgaria 
the us is not isolated by any means at all attali said 
indicating other nations also object to full soviet participation 
attali refused to comment directly on a compromise offered by 
france it would allow the soviets to join the bank as a 6 percent 
shareholder and limit them to 6 percent of total lending 
the issued could be resolved before the next meeting which is 
set for april 9 attali said negotiators were at the point of 
consensus and believed the last obstacles would soon be overcome 
the participants did agree that the 12nation european community 
would provide 51 percent of the bank capital of about 12 billion 
attali said 
negotiators have also found common ground on how loans will be 
distributed between the private and public sectors attali said 
but he refused to reveal the formula 
japan britain and the united states had insisted loans be 
restricted to private sector investment some other countries 
proposed allowing 40 percent be made available for public projects 
like roads and telephone networks 
attali predicted final terms could be set in april or may with 
the bank making loans by the end of the year or in early 1991

the government of china denounced a us embassy 
investigation into the treatment of american journalists denying 
charges that its security forces have stepped up surveillance of 
foreign reporters 
correspondents from nearly a dozen foreign news organizations 
say they have been followed or their chinese sources harassed by 
plainclothes police in recent weeks 
foreign ministry spokesman li zhaoxing said march 8 that such 
reports were groundless and that reporters who carry out normal and 
legitimate news coverage need not worry that they might run into 
troubles 
an investigation into the claims ordered by the state department 
was an interference in chinas internal affairs li said 
should an investigation be really necessary the 
justiceupholding people in the world would have every reason to 
ask how many things has this superpower done in broad daylight 
over the years to trample upon the sovereignty and infringe upon 
the human rights of other nations 
the surveillance of foreign reporters appeared to step up after 
martial law was lifted in beijing on jan 11 with some journalists 
saying they have been tailed even while jogging or shopping 
journalists say chinese security agents have also tried to 
photograph their meetings with chinese sources and have 
interrogated their chinese contacts

order the newspaper said violates the first amendment by denying it 
access to criminal court files 
in september state district judge charles hearn ordered harris 
county district clerk ray hardy to refuse public access to the 
addresses and telephone numbers of defendants in criminal court 
files until the defendants retained a lawyer or had one appointed 
to represent them 
the action was taken to stop defense lawyers from soliciting 
potential clients according to court records 
but hardy said he does not have the manpower to examine the 
approximately 100 criminal files he receives each day and edit out 
addresses and telephone numbers according to a brief filed by the 
newspaper the clerk then decided to withhold entire files the 
newspaper said 
the files in the criminal intake division constitute a 
unique and irreplaceable newsgathering resource for members of the 
media the brief said it also said denying names and telephone 
numbers to the press interferes with reporters responsibility to 
check information for accuracy 
the court without writing an opinion denied the newspapers

reuters filed court papers march 9 opposing 
united press internationals request for a preliminary injunction 
barring reuters from backing out of a picture exchange agreement 
upi claims reuters has deprived it of photo revenue for the past 
five years and is seeking damages of more than 600000 
under an arrangement that began in 1985 and which was supposed 
to run for 10 years upi provided reuters with pictures from the 
united states while reuters supplied pictures from other countries 
reuters which claims upis photo report has declined since the 
exchange began has filed suit in federal court seeking to void the 
contract between the two news services 
in the memorandum of march 9 made in response to a counterclaim 
made by upi reuters denied allegations that it poached certain 
upi clients taken away employees and was trying to drive upi out 
of business 
it is a collection of inflammatory statements based on no 
authority whatever or on serious distortions of the documents at 
issue reuters said 
upi has filed a request for arbitration in the case saying 
reuters is obligated under agreements between the two companies to 
reimburse upi for any revenue lost as a result of subscribers 
shifting to reuters photo service 
reuters spokesman robert crooke said there is no evidence upi 
lost money because of his companys marketing activities 
we welcome the opportunity that the arbitration provides to 
establish not only that reuter activities are not the cause of 
upis losses but that those causes lie much closer to upis own 
actions crooke said 
us district judge peter k leisure earlier issued a temporary 
restraining order against reuters which remains in effect until he 
decides whether to issue the injunction 
reuters said feb 16 it was canceling the agreement and halted 
its flow of pictures to upi for more than four hours 
reuters has alleged that upis photo service has declined since 
the exchange began

short of funds but not proposals the 
administration is cranking out goals guidelines initiatives and 
objectives at an unmatched rate all are tailored to fit president 
bushs pledge no new taxes 
at least no new federal taxes 
the latest catalogue of administration aims was the new 
transportation policy proposed last week featuring 169 guidelines 
and 65 legislative objectives by transportation department count 
its time to act president bush said and its time to give 
our state and local governments the flexibility that they need to 
best use federal funds 
the amount of federal money they get to use flexibly is another 
matter democratic governors like new yorks mario cuomo said state 
and local governments have been paying a steadily increasing share 
of transportation costs for the past 10 years 
secretary of transportation samuel k skinner said the states 
want more authority and responsibility over the use of 
transportation funds and should have it but were also going to 
ask them to come up with a greater share he said 
the transportation blueprint and the instant dispute about 
financing highways airport and mass transit systems produced a 
replay of the debate over education reform measures 
last month the administration embraced an education reform plan 
based on six goals and 21 more specific objectives drafted by 
governors after bushs 1989 education summit 
democrats complained that the administration wasnt proposing 
enough federal school aid to back its endorsement of reform house 
speaker thomas d foley said the administration budget recommends a 
2 percent increase in federal education spending but the gap is 
too big for that we dont have a 2 percent problem he said 
in each case the administration has set ambitious goals for 
reform and improvement in a costly and vital facet of american 
life to put things right by the year 2000 in each the cost has 
been left to be filled in later with resources to be found 
elsewhere 
dealing with education the administration maintains that more 
money wont buy reform that it is going to take changes in the way 
children are taught and schools are operated 
bush said he would seek increased flexibility in the use of 
federal aid with increased accountability on the part of the 
states 
the same offer is built into the transportation policy 
but there is a basic difference reform wont rebuild roads 
bridges or outdated airports that takes money and a lot of it 
public and private estimates put the cost of rebuilding the 
american infrastructure at well over 3 trillion furthermore the 
federal government historically has had a far greater role in 
transportation than in education 
the administration blueprint basically seeks to have state and 
local governments and the people and businesses using 
transportation facilities take increasing responsibility for the 
cost of repairing them and running them 
i think we feel that state and local governments have not 
provided a sufficient amount of infrastructure funding skinner 
in a variation on ronald reagans old theory that washington 
should cut both spending and taxes and leave more of both to the 
states the administration argued that increases in federal 
transportation levies would foreclose state decisions 
and if the federal government were to raise the gas tax it 
would eliminate or it would basically preempt state governments 
from raising their gas tax skinner said 
he said 33 states have increased their gasoline taxes or taken 
other steps to create special funds for transportation facilities 
in the past three years skinner said that shows the states are 
willing to do it but democratic gov wallace wilkinson of 
kentucky where the gasoline tax already has been increased a 
nickel a gallon said the states are running out of options he 
said it would be virtually impossible for him to ask for another 
gas tax boost 
the administration plan also says restrictions should be relaxed 
so that state and local governments can raise transportation funds 
in other ways including the use of highway tolls and airport 
passenger charges it urges efforts to get private business and 
investors involved in building and running transportation 
facilities 
washington the new policy says is to concentrate on collecting 
user fees as the key element in financing the federal share of 
transportation expenditures 
that fits the nonewtax game plan bush budget advisers said 
from the beginning that user fees dont count as tax increases 
even though the people paying them may not always see the 
difference

ever wonder what goes on inside the heads of the 
worlds biggest business leaders 
the march 26 issue of fortune featuring perspectives on the 
90s from 126 business luminaries provides a rare glimpse 
the twicemonthly magazine produced much more than just another 
issue to celebrate its own 60th anniversary it scoured the world 
for deep thinkers some big names and some not so wellknown to 
serve up an outlook for the decade ahead 
the result is a document that is exhilarating and troubling 
exhilarating because it gives voice all the views are aired 
via the first person to a wonderfully optimistic view of the 
future one where the environment is protected the customer is 
served and executives hold fewer meetings 
but troubling because it can leave you wondering why all this 
visionary leadership from the executive suite hasnt yet been 
translated into hard achievements especially in america which by 
some accounts has lost at least a step in the global business 
footrace 
lee iacocca ever blunt gets to the heart of the matter on the 
second page of the fortune presentation 
we cant sit around and commiserate with one another weve 
got to get good weve got to compete weve got to be world class 
we cant just shout it weve got to be it 
billionaire ross perot follows with a view of who is world class 
when i go to asia or europe i feel like im looking at 
tomorrow when i go to many us cities i see decay and neglect 
and i feel like im looking at yesterday 
thats not to say america is losing its patented ingenuity 
software genius bill gates who at 34 may be the nations youngest 
billionaire says he sees a future of information at your 
fingertips that will give middle managers access to data now 
reserved for chief executives 
arno penzias of atampt bell labs a leading research and 
development group takes the idea a step further describing a 
multimedia terminal with a bunch of video windows that will 
allow business people to talk with each other while they do their 
desktop computing 
but gates adds the sobering view that a lot of plumbing 
needs to be done to put such a system in place 
we need faster microprocessors local area networks graphic 
commands for the user all these things were working on notes 
gates 
whats unsettling is that others may be far ahead of us some of 
the foreign leaders quoted by fortune leave the impression they 
could stock the shelves at any moment with the products weve all 
been waiting for 
hiroyuki mizuno head of rampd for matsushita electric industrial 
of japan talks of new intelligent tools in the home vcrs and 
home appliances activated by voice commands even over the phone 
the kicker on his remarks suggests such machines arent far off 
at least for the japanese 
all the big electronics companies are discussing how to do 
this he says at the end of his commentary 
if the prospect of being overrun by the japanese doesnt scare 
you the comments of some of wall streets finest may lewis 
ranieri who helped create the mortgagebacked bond business that 
blossomed in the era of leverage believes the game of greed will 
continue in the 90s 
the hottest game in finance will be guys with cash buying 
assets at a discount he says 
the worrisome undercurrent running through these comments is 
that american leaders may have missed or ignored the real 
lessons of the 80s as john f welch jr chief executive of 
general electric correctly notes the pace of change in the 90s 
will make the 80s look like a picnic 
is the united states as ready as some other competitors to face 
this future maybe not 
the problem is that nobody is even asking the questions much 
less coming up with a coherent set of strategies to execute the 
answers computer wizard steve jobs told fortune in what may be 
the most pessimistic assessment in the magazine 
getting rid of general noriega is important but i wish the 
computer industry would get a tenth of the space on our national 
agenda that he has says jobs 
you might want to put this particular issue of fortune in a box 
somewhere and pull it out again at the turn of the century just to 
see if americans and their world business partners rallied the 
necessary public and private sector support for turning their 
dreams into reality

it all began on a friday the 13th kay bartlett 
was about to accompany a friend who wanted to look at a black cat 
she was thinking about adopting then came the fall and now more 
than two years later she still battles a very unfriendly 
poltergeist that controls her life chronic pain syndrome 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
two years and a couple of months ago i lost 
control of my life 
pain took over 
now it regulates nearly every moment of my waking life holding 
me captive to its savage dictates 
twice a night too it comes to visit sometimes just to say 
hello and remind me it is still round other times to visit for a 
long chat 
pain makes me irritable it makes me cry it sends me into fits 
of rage and sloughs of despair 
my pain stems from a neck injury suffered in a fall that 
ironically was caused by a medication which dumped my blood 
pressure and sent me into a semiconvulsion in my kitchen i woke up 
choking on my blood not sure how long i had been unconscious 
whether it was all blood pressure or whether the bonks on formica 
contributed 
the immediate damage was quickly assessed i had knocked out my 
two front teeth although my neck and shoulders ached it seemed 
like the kind of pain that i as a weekend warrior athlete would 
normally get when i played tennis or softball 
but these aches did not heal they went from aching to the 
feeling that a woodpecker was perched on my right shoulder 
constantly pecking at a knot in the right side of my neck then the 
pain started shooting up and down the spine then the muscle spasms 
took over one night i lost most of the power in my right side 
temporarily i started falling on the street my right leg just 
losing it 
i have consulted more than a dozen physicians mostly 
specialists as well as nontraditional healers two 
acupuncturists one acupressurist even a pain hypnotist he 
decreed i was among the 20 percent of the population that is not 
hypnotizable 
the consensus is i have crossed over into what they call 
chronic pain syndrome 
i dont want to hear that 
i want it fixed dammit 
if they can operate on fetal hearts sew back fingers severed by 
subway cars perform open heart surgery as routinely as 
appendectomies why oh why cant they fix a neck that simply took 
a heavy bang 
pain has changed my life narrowing it as old age will 
eventually do but at 49 im not old enough to be this old i 
feel like in the last two years i have aged 30 
i no longer drive its too painful and potentially hazardous 
ive let my license expire 
ive been to one broadway show and one movie since the accident 
it is too painful to sit in a seat for two hours especially at 
night when i have been up part of the day ditto for museums art 
galleries concerts and all the other reasons one chooses to live 
in new york city 
i cannot read for long periods at a time 
doing dishes is a killer but a necessity ironing is out i 
dont wear anything that needs to be ironed 
i rarely wear my contact lenses anymore the neck movement to 
put them in and take them out is a painful one 
ive not bought any clothes since the nov 13 1987 fall its 
too painful to try them on 
i tried shopping once but the pain became overpowering and i 
raced home to a manhattan apartment that has now become my 
workplace most of the time it seems silly i live 20 blocks from 
my office but it costs too much in pain to go in to the office 
every day it is more productive and less painful but lonely and 
isolated to work from home with todays computer technology its 
possible 
its the little things that defeat my spirit routine tasks have 
become minefields waiting to explode the pain pulling on pantyhose 
and boots could be the worst mistake of the day brushing my 
teeth it always hurts why washing my hair under a hot shower 
hurts is the biggest mystery that should feel good but it 
doesnt 
i see movies now on my vcr ive also learned that people even 
close friends just are incapable of understanding something as 
foreign as this kind of captivity they constantly ask if ive seen 
the latest movie or eagerly recommend one 
i have explained for a million times that i dont go to movies 
they ask incredulously for the millionth time how could sitting 
in a movie bother me 
what do you say nothing eventually you dont explain

yes i could go to a movie if that was the only plan of the day 
its just that too many other things take priority working fixing 
food getting dressed running errands going to the supermarket 
writing checks dumping garbage 
before the fall i usually took care of household chores in a 
white tornado fashion food shopping laundry and apartment 
cleaning all in one day usually finishing by 3 pm 
i usually went out four or five times a week either to a play 
a movie dinner at someones home or a restaurant nothing 
dramatic i frequently was a weekend guest at country homes of 
friends i sailed i often walked two miles to work through 
central park 
now im mostly an isolated homebody im lucky i have a single 
friend left i have canceled more appointments than ive kept 
my pain has caused me to budget my activities the way a person 
existing on a limited fixed income shops my income is the 
ability to stand or sit up straight to do anything that requires 
flexion the ability to look down to concentrate without the 
overwhelming distraction of pain 
in short to function 
i manage my pennies of energy carefully going out at night is a 
lavish expenditure 
new companions in addition to the cervical collar are the 
moist heating pad the old sock with three tennis balls inside the 
better to get the heat on the spot where the pain likes to sear 
jars and jars of mineral ice a remedy that works something like 
putting medication on a tooth that really needs dental attention 
its help is shortlived but ill take it 
ive learned a lot of tricks some vetoed by the doctors one is 
to drive the back of my head into the living room carpet with all 
my might it seems to get something off of something trouble is 
the sophisticated tests dont show anything on anything im 
betting on my body not technology the other is to hunker down 
put all my weight on the balls of my feet and stretch out the whole 
spine that helps too for no apparent medical reason 
i have learned a lot about pain 
one it can drive you crazy even in small amounts by its 
constancy 
two it can drive you to question your sanity when it lifts 
when pain is gone for some mysterious reason so is the memory of 
it you immediately begin thinking you made it all up or more 
ominously that its not coming back i still fall for that i 
guess its a tribute to the elasticity of the human spirit its 
also pretty stupid 
three its not nice to fool mother nature distraction therapy 
works temporarily while it may be good for the psyche pain will 
get the last laugh you pay the piper if you push the body beyond 
where it is ready to go it is better to cooperate when it says 
this is going to be a bad day believe it rest it the next day 
will be better 
four pain is tiring 
five pain is not one entity it is an orchestra sometimes 
featuring a soloist sometimes many instruments my worst pain is 
the searing pain right along the right side of the vertebrae it 
can be razor sharp with each step digging in 
there is the shooting pain down my right arm often causing 
ersatz numbness in my fingers its not total numbness its more 
like the sensation you have when the novocaine is wearing off you 
feel something but not everything 
there is the stab of the muscle spasms the ache of soreness 
sometimes dull sometimes acute always persistent 
twice a week i go to physical therapy where i am tractioned 
ultrasounded electronically stimulated i spend a few minutes 
every hour exercising i am surely by now a contender for a mention 
in the guinness book of world records for the most shoulder rolls 
completed 
i will not share all the advice ive been given you can imagine 
it one i must a new ager among my acquaintances told me this 
unmitigating pain was a wonderful opportunity for spiritual growth 
fortunately she was on the other end of the telephone out of 
range of my rage 
the one piece of advice i will never take is that i must quit 
fighting that i must accept the pain 
i will never give up i will get rid of it

the battle lines are drawn again at antietam 
the scene of some of the bloodiest fighting of the civil war as 
preservationists seek to protect the area from encroaching 
development this time neighbor is pitted against neighbor with the

played out at other historic sites around the country

once again millard kefauvers 280acre 
dairy farm is in the line of fire 
kefauvers greatgrandfather farmed the same land when union and 
confederate soldiers surged across the rolling western maryland 
landscape on sept 17 1862 in the bloodiest single day of 
fighting of the civil war 
now kefauver and his family are swept up in a struggle over 
efforts to protect the antietam national battlefield park from 
encroaching development 
it is typical of many struggles being fought out as the great 
cities of america extend their suburbs into the oncequiet 
countryside 
battles were fought near areas that had strategic importance 
then and since they had strategic importance then they would have 
growth potential now says edwin bearss chief historian of the 
national park service and a specialist on the civil war 
the national trust for historic preservation says cedar creek 
battlefield and belle grove plantation at middletown va where 
union general phil sheridan handed the confederacy one of its final 
stunning blows by winning control of the shenandoah valley in 1864 
could be surrounded by eight 10acre industrial parks 
in 1988 congress authorized acquisition of stuarts hill at 
manassas va stopping plans for a 12 millionsquarefoot 
shopping mall on land where the blue and the gray fought two 
crucial battles just last year congress stepped in again and 
approved expansion of fredericksburg and spotsylvania national 
military park in virginia 
it is not just civil war battlefields that are threatened 
preservationists say the national trust has a list of what it 
calls the 11 most endangered historic places including sites 
associated with columbus landing in the virgin islands the 
rivalry of spain and england for control of the georgia and south 
carolina coasts early in the 18th century and 19th century gold 
and silver strikes in south dakota 
preservationists are far from united on how to deal with the 
situation 
one view is that the only way to protect a park and the only 
way to be truly fair to landowners is to have the federal 
government purchase the property says bruce craig of the 
national parks and conservation association 
that approach got a boost as long ago as the 1890s when 
congress established gettysburg national military park in 
pennsylvania blocking gettysburg electric railway co from 
building a development around big round top a vital point of 
ground in the engagement that marked the highwater mark of 
confederate fortunes 
the railroad sued saying congress didnt have the power to 
acquire land for commemorative purposes the supreme court in a 
unanimous opinion in 1896 replied such a use seems not only 
a public use but one so closely connected with the welfare of the 
republic itself as to be within the powers granted the congress by 
the constitution for the purpose of protecting and preserving the 
whole country 
the trouble is that protecting and preserving the whole country 
can be costly 
in the manassas case for example the purchase price was left 
to future negotiation and hasnt been settled yet 
what the lands will ultimately cost the taxpayer no one 
knows says bearss the park service historian 
in addition says craig of the parks and conservation 
association there is sometimes a community hesitation and a 
suspicion of what the federal government is likely to do with that 
property 
there sure is 
i can never be satisfied with anything the park service 
does says russell weaver of sharpsburg president of save 
historic antietam with responsible policies sharp one of two 
rival citizens groups that have sprung up around the battlefield 
tom clemens president of the save historic antietam foundation 
shaf says there are still people in sharpsburg who would just 
like the whole battlefield and the national park service to go 
away and that isnt going to happen 
the latest fracas was touched off in 1985 when the zoning 
commission approved a rezoning that paved the way for construction 
expected soon of a shopping center next door to the privately 
owned grove farm where president abraham lincoln met with union

i was one of the people who was galvanized to action by that 
particular incident says shaf president clemens who teaches 
theater at hagerstown junior college and describes himself as a 
civil war fanatic 
we decided that we had just had enough 
eric seifarth agricultural land preservation specialist for the 
county planning department said recently that washington county 
lost about 1700 acres of farmland to development in fiscal 1989 
and could have none left for the next generation if the rate 
continues he said there are between 50000 and 80000 acres of 
prime farmland left in the 293000acre county 
in a recent article in national parks magazine richard rambur 
superintendent of the antietam park said that when he arrived in 
august 1987 he found that 33 percent of the working population of 
south washington county was commuting to washington or baltimore 
each about 75 miles from sharpsburg 
in nearby shepherdstown wva the population is expected to 
double within five years with the advent of a new housing 
development for nearly 2000 people rambur said in an interview 
the trend is indeed becoming obvious the argument is over what 
to do about it 
its not just simply a case of the developers are coming the 
developers are coming its a question of who are the 
developers said ann corcoran a sharp member who with her 
husband howard operates a 300acre farm adjacent to and partially 
within the battlefield 
the county established a 23member commission of farmers 
realtors and others and in june 1989 adopted its final product a 
plan called the antietam overlay it requires review of all new 
home construction in the 2900 acres surrounding the 815acre 
battlefield lays down standards to make commerical buildings on 
approach roads compatible with the historic character of the area 
and calls for an approved forestry plan for timber clearcutting on 
nearby red hill 
at this point sharp was formed telling area residents in a 
letter it suspected that the enactment of the overlay was the 
beginning of a larger scheme to preserve the viewshed around the 
battlefield to make it more attractive to tourists and commercial 
developers the organization also maintains that restrictions in 
the overlay would make modern farming more difficult shaf on the 
other hand supports the overlay 
sharp proposed a plan under which landowners around the 
battlefield would sell development rights to their property at a 
suggested 4000 an acre to keep it in agricultural use about 
half the money would come from the state and the rest would be 
raised from private sources the organization also filed suit 
challenging the overlay the county has asked that the suit be 
dismissed 
the park service has developed three alternatives for the future 
of the battlefield 
one alternative calls for keeping the battlefield basically as 
it is the second calls for expanding the park by as much as 250 
acres to take in the grove farm and other sites eliminating fences 
and roads and taking other steps to make such battlegrounds as the 
miller cornfield and the eroded gulley known as bloody lane look 
more as they did in 1862 the third is a compromise between the 
two rambur predicts there will be further compromise before some 
plan is adopted in six months or so 
the state of maryland is also interested 
at a meeting in january at the battlefield visitors center gov 
william donald schaefer announced plans for a nonprofit trust that 
would combine private grants and charitable contributions to 
augment state and county payments for land development rights 
this plan is more historically oriented and would impose more 
severe restrictions on development than the agricultural easements 
envisioned by sharp 
millard and nancy kefauver meanwhile continue living inside 
the park boundaries in their privately owned home which served as 
a union field hospital during the battle 
we sort of felt like we knew as much about protecting it as 
the park service did mrs kefauver says 
they are very nervous and concerned about what plans the park 
service has for them ms corcoran says 
in washington preservationists have a different concern they 
are pushing for legislation intended to give federal protection to 
endangered historic sites somewhat like the protection now given to 
endangered species of wildlife 
it really is remarkable to say that the snail darter enjoys 
more federal protection than the antietam battlefield says j 
jackson walter president of the national trust for historic 
preservation

in the two years since his appointment to the 
us supreme court was rejected robert bork has found a new forum 
from his base at a conservative think tank he has become a 
bestselling author and hes soon to hit the lecture circuit no 
he doesnt think he will ever get another shot at the high court 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
the man who would have been a member of the 
us supreme court and was stingingly rebuffed by the senate is 
quick to smile at the irony the last two years have brought 
robert heron bork does not dwell on past disappointments in 
fact he sees himself having a bigger impact on the law from the 
sidelines than he would have had from the bench 
he says he is taking his case to a higher court the american 
public and the next generation 
one reason why is that robert bork former marine former 
practicing lawyer former yale professor of law former solicitor 
general former professor at yale again former judge of the us 
circuit of appeals is now a bestselling writer 
to his surprise the tempting of america the political 
seduction of the law has been on the bestseller list for more 
than 10 weeks and there are more than 190000 copies in print 
has that vindicated his views i never felt the need for 
vindication he says with a chuckle 
bork was nominated for the supreme court in july 1987 and four 
months later the democratcontrolled senate judiciary committee 
after an often vitriolic debate found him unfit for the job his 
strict constructionist views of the constitution threatened the 
inclusion of womens rights under the 14th amendment and evoked a 
public outcry from blacks and labor 
in the political undercurrent it was also remembered that bork 
as solicitor general dismissed special prosecutor archibald cox 
during the saturday night massacre in the nixon administration 
sitting in his office at the american enterprise institute his 
back to his word processor he briefly considers what might have 
been 
i dont want to spend the rest of my life reliving it i have 
other things to do 
he recalls the impact of a book he wrote a dozen years ago on 
antitrust law a lot of people were good enough to say it had a 
great influence on moving antitrust laws from where they were to 
where they are now 
i hope in the same way to have some effect with this one he 
says pointing out the antitrust book had a greater impact than a 
few opinions he might have handed down from the bench 
you know if you are on a court you are one vote and you 
cant sit down and write 300 pages of connected argument to show 
why this is the right approach 
i think this book has the chance to have more impact i think 
i am talking to the next generation 
he says he has has received more than 200 letters from readers 
some short some long some funny some analytical all supporting 
he says the law reviews have yet to come out but one university 
is planning four of them the book is also planned for paperback 
which should reach a student audience 
bork has plans for perhaps two more books one in more academic 
detail on constitutional law aimed at law schools and another on 
the relationship of law and the culture he will hit the lecture 
circuit this spring and fall and will teach a constitutional law 
course next year at george mason university occasionally he writes 
magazine commentary articles 
perhaps another shot at the court i dont think so i dont 
think thats in the cards the first time around when i was 
nominated for the court of appeals the senate approved me 
unanimously as did the committee 
but now he feels the senate has taken a position on him that 
would preclude its backing down 
he relishes what free time he has he is catching up on reading 
hes not had a chance to do making up for longtime neglect 
flexners four volumes on washington english philosopher john 
stuart mill and his critics he and his wife mary ellen eschew 
most commercial television programs and rent videotapes instead 
popular culture as far as im concerned has gone straight 
downhill bork says 
during the hearings bork was astonished to learn that a radio 
reporter had gone to the video store he frequents and obtained a 
list of all of the tapes he had rented i guess he was hoping for 
something really scandalous but all he got was fred astaire and 
cary grant there is now a law against giving out such lists 
at his bedside table are mysteries his other pastime martha 
grimes dorothy sayers john dickson carr margery allingham but 
its hard to follow a story when you read only four pages a night 
he says 
the sedentary life has taken its toll asked what his ideal 
weight would be he smiles and offers an understatement less 
than it is now i have to get myself back in shape so i can get 
back to tennis i used to like to ski but i wouldnt dare now 
he went skiing once when he was out of shape he was halfway 
down the slope he says when the muscles began to flutter and 
thats not very good because you have to get down the rest of the 
mountain 
bork enjoys the atmosphere at the american enterprise institute 
the conservative think tank that has become his small university 
his colleagues include irving kristol publisher of the national 
interest former un ambassador jeane kirkpatrick former state 
department arms negotiator richard perle and political economic 
and social commentators such as ben wattenberg michael novak 
norman ornstein and walter berns 
the institute does not make grave demands on its members there 
is an occasional brownbag lunch where a speaker is brought in from 
the outside 
bork who abhored grading papers when he taught says with a 
selfsatisfied grin its a very good faculty with no blue 
books 
the faculty often gets together for dinner but one suggests 
given that many active minds around the dinner table the soup must 
get cold 
not mine says bork

all five movies nominated as best picture of 
1989 were films that hollywoods heavyhitters thought would be 
financial flops but their creators persisted and got the movies 
made and monday night one will walk off with the film industrys 
top prize 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
the movies born on the fourth of july and 
driving miss daisy both shunned by the major hollywood 
studios are the favorites to win oscars when the film industry 
honors its own monday night 
the 62nd academy awards extravaganza at the los angeles music 
center will begin on abc at 9 pm est with billy crystal as master 
of ceremonies the show hoping to improve on sagging tv ratings in 
recent years will feature satellite tieins from moscow buenos 
aires argentina london sydney australia and tokyo 
the contenders for acting prize include 80yearold jessica 
tandy and marlon brando 65 who both achieved fame 40 years ago 
when they costarred on broadway in a streetcar named desire 
miss tandy the cranky dowager of driving miss daisy is 
deemed the favorite in a difficulttopredict race for best 
actress michelle pfeiffer the sexy singer of the fabulous baker 
boys is also highly touted 
leading the race for best actor are tom cruise the disabled 
veteran of born on the fourth of july and daniel daylewis 
the cerebral palsy victim of my left foot 
brando was nominated for best supporting actor for his role as 
the liberal south african lawyer in a dry white season the 
unpredictable brando accepted his first oscar for on the 
waterfront in 1954 but spurned his second for the godfather 
in 1972 
among the stars who will present the awards are warren beatty 
jessica lange jack lemmon from moscow jack nicholson steve 
martin rachel ward and bryan brown from sydney and last years 
acting winners jodie foster geena davis and kevin kline 
all five nominees for best picture of 1989 were movies that all 
of the major hollywood studios spurned as being too special to 
attract a wide audience for instance driving miss daisy 
it was turned down by all the major companies reports 
richard zanuck who produced the film with his wife lili then 
we went to some of the minor players among the companies no one 
thought it was commercial the consensus was that it would be a 
nice movie with good reviews but it couldnt attract a wide 
audience 
they also felt that it needed a stronger cast by that time we 
had locked in jessica tandy and morgan freeman on a payorplay 
basis meaning they would have to be paid whether they appeared or 
not they wanted a younger actress like meryl streep shirley 
maclaine or jane fonda who could be aged but for a character that 
started the film in her 70s and ended in her 90s that seemed 
impractical 
the zanucks solved the problem by trimming the budget from 125 
million to 75 million and cutting 20 days from the schedule 
everyone on the production worked for lower salaries including 
latecomer dan aykroyd who took the zanuck offer of 150000 vs 
his usual salary of 1million plus 
warner bros agreed to pay 5 million for the us releasing 
rights and a london company provided 25 million for foreign 
rights 
it took two years before i could find anybody to consider 
dead poets society says tom schulman who wrote the original 
screenplay every agent turned it down every studio turned it 
down 
they said it was a nice screenplay but no picture about a 
prep school had been successful besides there were no girls in 
the story and it dealt with poetry 
schulman stuck to his story about an english teacher who 
inspires his students to creative thinking with bursts of poetry 
he finally interested producer steven haft who took the project to 
disneys touchstone pictures where the script had previously been 
rejected 
first dustin hoffman was scheduled to direct and star but he 
dropped out for rain man then director peter weir 
witness came aboard followed by robin williams who added a 
whole new dimension to the role of teacher john keating dead 
poets society ended up with a 94 million gross in the united 
states and canada 
directorwriter phil alden robinson devoted six years to 
bringing field of dreams to the screen he first read wp 
kinsellas baseball fantasy shoeless joe in 1982 and tried to 
interest the studios 
i was turned down at every studio remarks robinson i was 
told we can see what you like in the novel but it wont make a 
movie 
finally in 1985 robinson found a taker lawrence gordon then 
head of production at 20th century fox the script was developed at 
fox but then gordon left for independent producing and field of 
dreams went into turnaround meaning it could be peddled to 
other studios gordon and his producerbrother charles took it to 
tom pollock at universal who said yes even before a star had been 
signed 
kevin costner was not even on our list of possibilities 
because he had just finished another baseball movie bull durham 
robinson recalls but costner learned about the script and 
accepted immediately after reading it the field of dreams 
domestic take 63 million 
born on the fourth of july holds the record among this 
years bestpicture nominees for length of time in reaching the 
screen 
oliver stone and ron kovic wrote the script based on kovics 
vietnam experiences in 197778 in 1979 stone was on the brink of 
directing the film with al pacino as star 
but the money was not there it wasnt considered 
commercial says stone who spent 10 years finding backers for 
his platoon best picture 1986 ten years later tom cruise 
took an interest in it platoon was a success and universal 
pictures which had originally killed the picture came back and 
financed it 
producer noel pearson didnt even canvass the major studios for 
backing of my left foot realizing a film about a cerebral 
palsy victim would attract a chilly reaction production began in 
dublin ireland with no assurance of financing using his own 
money plus donations from a friend and irish television slowly he 
accumulated enough for the budget under 3 million 
the same pattern of rejection of academy award nominees by the 
big studios has occurred increasingly in recent years why 
i think its the cost factor theorizes richard zanuck 
even with smaller pictures the cost of advertising and prints 
can amount to a major investment the studios naturally avoid 
projects that they consider dangerous or not in the mainstream 
but driving miss daisy and the other nominees have proven 
that audiences are hungry for material that is not devoted to 
rapes car crashes murder and blood

after years of trying to predict the winners 
of the academy awards i proceed with caution here goes 
picture a photo finish between born on the fourth of july 
and driving miss daisy because the academy prefers feelgood 
movies it looks as if everythings coming up daisys 
actor another close one between tom cruise fourth of 
july and daniel daylewis my left foot if fourth of 
july wins best picture it could be cruise otherwise daylewis 
actress jessica tandy driving miss daisy seems 
unbeatable but michelle pfeiffer the fabulous baker boys 
could surprise 
supporting actor martin landau crimes and misdemeanors 
with denzel washington glory a possibility 
supporting actress wide open with julia roberts steel 
magnolias and brenda fricker my left foot the leaders

few people know that walloon lake in michigan 
was a sometime home to one of americas most famous writers of this 
century ernest hemingway but so far as some oldtimers care the 
youth who grew up to write for whom the bells toll and the 
sun also rises only passed this way 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
the hemingway cottage on walloon lake 
is unmarked locals say ernest hemingways younger sister sunny 
took down the historical plaque that pointed out windemere the 
summer home where ernest played fished and took his bride 
sunny still summers here 
sunny mrs madelaine miller 85 also asked the petoskey 
chamber of commerce to stop giving directions to the low white 
house among the cedars 
no matter hemingway fanatics on their summer pilgrimages find 
it anyway 
it is hemingways michigan that is elusive 
they dont know what theyre looking for says melissa 
creasey with her mother she manages the 114yearold horton bay 
general store four miles from windemere 
creasey sells pizzas and tshirts to the pilgrims and answers 
their questions they ask is this the place 
it is hemingway described the falsefront store with its wide 
porch in up in michigan a scandalous story about the rape of a 
horton bay woman it was one of his earliest published stories 
but that isnt what the fans want to know 
they want whatever it was here that flamed the son of an oak 
park ill doctor into the burning bright writer who crystalized 
the ripple of a trout stream or the seduction of an indian girl 
they want to know why it influenced hemingway says bill 
ohle 79 a retired ad man from chicago whose grandfather 
constructed many of the buildings around horton bay 
ohle lives down the lane from the store in his fathers hilltop 
cabin overlooking lake charlevoix theres a landscape painted by 
hemingways mother hanging over the fireplace 
the pilgrims want something larger than life some sign of the 
emerging greatness ohle says what they find are stories about a 
boy nobody much noticed 
ohle was a scrawnylegged kid while a teenage ernest hemingway 
freeloaded chicken dinners at liz dilworths boarding house across 
the street and cast for trout on the bay at the bottom of the hill 
he remembers ernest fishing ernest courting cousin marjorie 
bump 22yearold ernest bringing his st louis fiancee hadley 
richardson to horton bay to get married in 1921 in a church since 
torn down he remembers ernest and his bride leaving a few weeks 
later and never coming back 
half a dozen of his better short stories are about this 
here ohle said gesturing about him it made a deep impression 
on the guy he had a ball out here 
it was wild then it was a kids dream those were days when a 
boy could steal away from his mothers cottage and catch trout and 
sleep under the stars the roads were dusty logging trails indians 
lived in the woods 
ohle points out the window toward a dark strip of land jutting 
across the sparkling water thats where ernest loved to fish 
thats the point where hemingways young nick adams rowed to that 
last night with his girl in the end of something 
hows the fishing now no one knows the point is privately 
owned and trespassing isnt allowed 
hemingway spent every summer of his youth at walloon lake in 
1918 just 19 he went to italy as an ambulance driver he returned 
from world war i with wounds from 227 pieces of shrapnel in his 
legs and took up residence in a boarding house in petoskey a hilly 
port town six miles to the north next to lake michigan he also 
earned the reputation of a ruffian 
while hemingways mother four sisters and baby brother still 
summered at windemere ernest crossed walloon lake and walked over 
four miles of rolling hills potato fields and apple orchards to 
horton bay he slept up the hill in the back shed at the dilworths 
boarding house 
lives changed hemingways father killed himself just as 
hadleys father had done ernest killed himself his sister ursula 
and his brother leicester killed themselves 
michigan changed wealthy resorters built 22room log cabins 
with threecar garages amid the tiny cottages on walloon lake 
petoskey exploded into a commercialized tourist town the beanery 
where hemingway once ate now sells resorter clothes its open only 
in the summer 
today developers on lake charlevoix advertise 325000 
waterfront condominiums on hemingway pointe with a slip which 
will accommodate your 55foot yacht 
biographer constance cappel in her 1977 book hemingway in 
michigan quotes an old chum asking hemingway if he would ever 
come back 
no he replied its too civilized now 
only horton bay a logging town on the skids when hemingway saw 
it looks the same its population has shrunk to 47 
hemingway returned in his writing casting northern michigan 
places and people in one novel and a dozen short stories about 
birth and death and sex and trout 
fact and fiction flew together like particles in an atom 
smasher hemingway exchanged the fox river for the twohearted 
river some 45 miles away he turned girlfriends into lovers 
very real people got hurt marjorie bump for one the redheaded 
girl with the easy smile who waited tables at dilworths became 
marge jilted by ernests autobiographical nick adams in the end 
of something and later fantasized about in the threeday blow 
she lived in terror of hemingway ohle says of his cousin 
they were obviously childhood sweethearts then he goes and 
writes her real name in a couple of stories all through life 
people discovered she was the marjorie in the stories 
she never got away from it it plagued her i think this was 
her first love really but half the time it turned to hate 
marjorie bump died a few years ago 
i hate to say it but i havent read too much of hemingway 
says kris woodruff the petoskey librarian 
yet hemingway stood in the library with his cane and rakish 
italian officers cape the winter of 1919 and told the ladies aid 
society about the horrors and glories of war 
rex miller the head librarian says hemingways writing is 
interesting but my tastes run in other directions i can take 
him or leave him and mostly i leave him 
mostly horton bay has left ernest hemingway just as completely 
as he left horton bay the general store has faded pictures of him 
on the walls a few hemingway tshirts a hemingway book lies on 
the coffee table by the front window 
but few around remember the roughhewn youth with a vivid 
imagination

coincidentally with the release of the movie 
glory a new book by a military science expert also tells of 
the experiences of the black soldiers who served under mostly white 
officers during the civil war the author by the way recommends 
the movie 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
a texas scholar who recently published a book 
about black soldiers in the civil war says the popular movie 
glory almost got it right 
almost but he liked the movie anyway 
joseph glatthaar an associate professor at the university of 
houston spent four years researching his newly released book 
forged in battle the civil war alliance of black soldiers and 
white officers 
glatthaar says it was exciting to see the lives of soldiers he 
has studied come to life on the screen but he notes some 
inaccuracies in the film which coincidentally came out about the 
same time as his book 
the movies very good i strongly recommend it glatthaar 
says what the movie is good at is conveying a sense to the 
observer of what it was like to be in these black units and what 
were some of the obstacles that they faced 
but from a strictly historical standpoint there are some 
problems he says 
one example is the scene in which robert gould shaw the white 
commander of the 54th massachusetts regiment orders a soldier 
flogged 
flogging was illegal in the united states army glatthaar 
says shaw would have been discharged from the service if he did 
that 
glatthaar says the hollywood version also included a fictitious 
sergeantmajor as shaws righthand man 
in reality the sergeant major of the 54th massachusetts was 
the son of the abolitionist and former slave frederick douglass 
which in itself is very interesting he says 
glatthaar has read hundreds of letters exchanged between the 
soldiers and their families as well as thousands of military 
documents from library archives 
there was no censorship of mails and people were very prolific 
with their own family or their own spouse and thats very 
revealing as far as racial attitudes go he says 
it was a letter from a white officer in charge of black soldiers 
that initially got glatthaars attention 
i do not think that i would exchange my position in this 
regiment for one of equal rank in any white regiment the officer 
wrote his brother 
glatthaar says he was intrigued by the strange alliance between 
the white officers and black soldiers many of them former slaves 
who were apprehended as contraband from the south 
of course you have the old situation with whites in power 
he says most of the blacks are from slavery so its a position 
to which theyre accustomed but not happy with and of course 
these blacks are experiencing freedom for the first time in the 
military and thats a strange situation too 
some 178000 blacks served under 7000 white officers in the 
us colored troops during the civil war only 110 blacks were able 
to become officers in their own regiments 
even before president abraham lincoln officially freed slaves in 
january 1863 black soldiers were recruited to fill the gaps left 
by casualties in the union army 
glatthaar notes that black soldiers suffered the indignities of 
lower wages undesirable assignments and dwindling supplies but 
for many it was a unique opportunity to serve as an equal to 
whites and to establish their rights for themselves by fighting 
their former owners 
but the white officers directing black troops were not popular 
back home 
they were heroes in the black community but they were 
despised by whites glatthaar says a lot of them were attacked 
and brutalized and their families abused 
but glatthaar says the most shocking indignities were those 
inflicted on black troops after the war 
what really surprised me most was the way the white population 
took away the accomplishments of the united states colored troops 
after the war glatthaar says they denied their achievements 
black soldiers who remained as peacekeeping forces in the south 
during reconstruction often suffered reprisals from former 
confederate soldiers 
in the north their fellow union army soldiers and officers 
began discounting their abilities 
blacks i think wisely felt that their white officers should 
have fought to help them gain full equal rights he says the 
white officers never overcame their prejudice 
glatthaar says the battle for equality continued in the military 
ranks for years to come 
in world war i glatthaar says they went through the 
exact same issues the exact same accusations that blacks didnt 
have the character to stand up in combat that they would all drop 
their weapons and run or that they would act like savages and 
fight uncontrollably and we couldnt trust them 
they just denied the fact that 178000 soldiers had performed 
superbly in the civil war they were reinventing the wheel in world 
war i and in fact again in world war ii

john neville the comic british butler on 
nbcs grand doesnt apologize for forsaking the shakespearean 
stage for a hollywood sitcom 
its not the first time that neville has given his career an 
unusual twist nor is it the first time hes been taken to task for 
it 
he was a matinee idol on the london stage and an heir to the 
crown of laurence olivier when he abruptly moved to canada in the 
early 1970s last year he resigned as artistic director of the 
stratford festival in canada 
i know what people are saying neville said in an interview 
shortly before returning to london to star in school for 
scandal at the national theater he first starred in the play at 
the haymarket theater in 1962 
they never say it to your face they say well hes sold out 
and gone to hollywood i say well im going back to the 
national theater in london 
desmond the redoubtable butler he plays in grand probably 
would offer a more cheeky response desmond trades quip for quip 
with his cranky master once bedded one of the bosss wives and for 
a time feared he was the real father of the bosss son 
the comedy whose quirky plot twists and unpredictable 
characters are reminiscent of soap made its debut in january 
its time slot after the cosby show and cheers on thursday 
have so far given it a charmed life 
this is work ive never done before neville says ive 
done virtually everything else i was attracted to the quality of 
grand it gives me a lot of pleasure ive never in my career 
experienced a fiveday week which at my age is rather pleasurable 
especially in california 
neville and his wife have an apartment here but have kept their 
home in stratford five of their children live in canada and one 
lives in england he would like to do more film work in 1988 he 
played the title role in the movie the adventures of baron 
munchausen 
he had resigned as head of the stratford festival before he was 
offered the role in grand 
i had no idea what i was going to do next he says thats 
been the story of my life ive run theaters for 25 years ive 
always given notice early having no idea what i would do each 
time something has always come up 
what attracted me was the quality of the writing the show was 
created by michael leeson who wrote taxi and the movie the war 
of the roses id never done a sitcom before 
grand follows the lives of eight people in a small 
pennsylvania town thats difficult to do its unusual for a 
sitcom because it has a kind of serial feel one show follows 
another you get to know the characters but it may take some time 
to find an audience people remind me that it took hill street 
blues two years to find an audience 
neville did very little television in canada although he had 
done quite a lot in england he starred as the duke of marlboro 
one of britains greatest generals and an ancestor of winston 
churchill in the bbc miniseries the first churchill it was 
the series that launched pbss masterpiece theatre in 1971 
he was at the old vic where he did nothing but shakespeare for 
six years he became a matinee idol in alfie then quit to 
become artistic director of the nottingham playhouse he was 
awarded the order of the british empire in 1965 
neville admits it was a major disappointment when he wasnt even 
approached about the movie role of alfie given to michael caine 
in 1966 
in 1972 he abruptly quit england for canada i had been asked 
to ottawa to direct the rivals for four weeks he says i had 
a very successful and illustrious career in england but i never 
went back i fell in love with canada i moved my wife and children 
there my wife wasnt surprised because ive always done kind of 
wayward and unexpected things in my career 
ive had no regrets about the moves ive made i consider 
myself a north american england isnt what it was when i grew up 
prior to grand neville completed four years at the 
stratford shakespearean festival a threetheater complex with a 
total of 3800 seats 
thats a lot of seats to fill he says people came from 
all over ontario from chicago ohio and even california we did 12 
to 13 plays a year with three plays running at once its 
predominantly shakespeare but we did cat on a hot tin roof last 
year 
we had a 45 million debt when i took over thats a lot for 
a theater i paid off the debt and left a healthy profit im very 
good at that i should run a movie studio

for some people a chorus line was more than 
a musical it was a way of life 
alyce gilbert has worked on broadways longestrunning show 
since the beginning from its first preview performances at the new 
york shakespeare festival public theater in april 1975 to its 
opening at broadways shubert theater the following july and 
throughout its 15year run 
now her job and those of its 58 other production people 26 
musicians and 34 dancers will end march 31 when a chorus line 
closes after 6104 performances 
gilbert is the musicals wardrobe mistress a quaint title for 
someone who must deal with four loads of dirty laundry every 
workday and twice on matinee days thats not to mention her 
finding getting repaired and keeping track of shoes socks 
buttons glass beads leotards pants jump suits jackets and top 
hats during what usually is a 12hour day or longer 
wardrobe is about continuity says the woman who first 
looked after costumes at age 12 for a childrens theater company in 
her hometown of milwaukee its not design its about things 
staying the same or kept within a certain parameter 
gilbert has the responsibility of maintaining the shows 
costumes designed by threetime tony winner theoni v aldredge she 
has had to make the replacement clothes look the way aldredge 
intended them to look a decade and a half ago that can mean a lot 
of problems 
youre dealing with some things that are rather firmly rooted 
in the fashion of 1975 that dont exist anymore gilbert says 
for one thing dance clothes have changed when a chorus 
line first opened dancewear mostly was nylon helanca now its 
milliskin made out of lycra a shiny spandex fiber that prevails 
everything in the world is made out of that now gilbert 
says so the musicals nylon dance clothes have to be specially 
ordered and then all the dancewear except for the womens black 
leotards has to be dyed 
theonis colors are very specific gilbert says all the 
women in the show wear some kind of red from pink to lavender to 
burgundy to maroon the men are dressed in blues browns and greens 
we took the bellbottoms out of the pants in 1981 it took a 
long time before they went out of dance pants primarily because it 
makes your legs look longer and thats something dancers always 
love 
gilbert has witnessed not only a revolution in dancewear but a 
change in the shapes of the dancers themselves 
it used to be a very long thin chorus line she says 
over the 15 years its become a much more athletic body dancers 
go to gyms they pump they do very distinct things to build bulky 
muscles which you never saw in 1975 it was not aesthetically 
pleasing then but somewhere along the line the publics eye 
changed and so did the choreographers 
gilberts workday usually has begun at 10 am in the basement 
of the shubert in a catacomblike space crammed with racks and 
boxes of costumes in every size and color 
its the buyitwhenyouseeitandkeepit syndrome she 
laughs weve got a lot of weird stuff around 
here she starts the days first load of laundry the dancewear 
is washed after each performance in a coldwater detergent the 
glittery finale costumes are pressed and checked for broken beads 
different dressers the show has five have beadin calls to 
go over the finale costumes to replace beads 
that costume has become a symbol of what broadway is 
gilbert says director michael bennett originally asked aldredge 
for red finale clothes similar to what he had used in follies 
but she came up with her own unique design 
it is based on everything being reflected gilbert says 
everything shines the fabrics the shoes the mens are patent 
leather the womens are satin the beads are glass when the light 
hits those clothes they look gold they look silver they look 
white its amazing what vanishes from them in terms of wear 
during the day gilbert deals with whatever has to be replaced 
or repaired toward evening the stage manager wanders by and 
announces who will be on stage that night a chorus line is a 
show in which understudies get a chance to perform frequently that 
means hauling out finale costumes for the replacement dancers 
about a half hour before curtain the five dressers come in the 
dancewear has been separated onto hangers one costume to a hanger 
and sent to the dressing rooms 
while the musical starts the finale costumes are set on racks 
at the side of the stage for the evenings splashy closing number 
during the show gilbert and the dressers fuss with the costume 
worn by cassie the lead female dancer and then get ready for the 
finale when the dressers go to help with the dancers finale 
changes gilbert goes too she personally hands out the top hats 
to them 
youre dealing with 17 people and 17 hats that look the 
same she says we dont keep the hats with finale costumes 
because its dark its easy to come up with the wrong hat if 
youre not focusing on that 
the process is repeated eight times a week 
youre in a rather unique position doing wardrobe 
particularly in this show says gilbert who got her start in 
1968 doing shows offbroadway ive learned that dancers are 
really so gallant they can be silly they can be petty they can 
be lots of things but when they have to go out and dance theres 
an extraordinary bravery 
all dance ever really gives them is the chance to be able to 
do it anything else is extra 
gilbert took two 6month leaves from a chorus line over the 
years to work on two other bennett shows ballroom and 
dreamgirls she always came back 
when a chorus line closes shell move over to grand 
hotel the tommy tune musical that has lavish 1920sstyle 
costumes and then there will probably be other shows she adds 
wistfully

when designers parade barebreasted togas or molded 
breastplates clown suits or dresses shot full of holes like swiss 
cheese what is the point are these meant to be worn or is this 
just hype 
the answer is not always obvious designers do show off to 
attract attention but sometimes their jokes sell well and turn 
into real fashion 
a recent case in point is saint laurents famous draped crepe 
greek dress which the model in his show wore with one shoulder 
pulled off to bare the breast 
but that was just a wink for the audience says house 
spokesman clara saint we certainly didnt expect anybody to go 
out on the street half naked the dress is selling but the way it 
was meant to be worn firmly and modestly hiding the bosom 
back in 1972 saint laurents haute couture collection revived 
the 1940s look featuring shoulder pads platformsoled shoes and 
other oddities evoking a cry of ugly from the heraldtribunes 
influential eugenia sheppard 
but what appeared on the streets a few months later platform 
soles shorter skirts even shoulder pads 
the pads really took off when fashion cowboy claude montana 
turned them into gridiron shapes worthy of joe montana not 
everyone went for the incredible hulk shape but many agree even 
now that a bit of padding in the shoulders helps distract from too 
much natural padding on a womans hips 
pariss most notable jokester is jeanpaul gaultier whose 
outrageous styles and zany shows keep the fashion press buzzing 
his sexcentricities have included amazon breastplates corsets 
and garter belts for party wear concierges aprons and knit skirts 
for men a lot of this stuff has sold 
i design clothes with an eye to what people want gaultier 
says if you see lacy garter belts thats because i think that 
people want a sign of a return to sexier styles in general 
he explains that his exaggerations are to make a point what 
looks outlandish is kind of a resume of my whole collection he 
says and i do design for people in the street there are a lot 
of fat people out there and i dress them up in my collections 
too 
i think designers are indeed making a statement with some of 
those wayout styles says carol mongo a professor at parsons 
school of design paris branch 
for example when they show transparent blouses without 
underwear they dont necessarily advocate seethrough nudity for 
everybody the idea is to look for more feminine styles light 
fabrics a certain transparent effect 
she notes that those draped esther williams bathingsuit 
dresses at ungaro a couple of seasons ago were just pointing the 
way to shorter skirts 
and about gaultiers metaltipped clodhoppers she observes 
those funky objects resembling sandm jobs finally filtered 
right down to the marketplace in cheaper copies 
the japanese are notable for showing inscrutable fashions that 
excite the jaded fashion crowd but confound women on main street 
when rei kawakubo at comme des garcons came out with her 
dropdead bag lady clothes shot full of holes vogues fashion 
editor polly mellon practically levitated out of her chair 
others scratched their heads 
but rei meant that look to be taken seriously says a former 
executive with the company who declined to be named this wasnt 
gimmickry if she put holes in the clothes it was part of her 
concept 
christian lacroix became a star comic creator when he pushed 
bustles flounces and even raccoon tails onto runways at patou in 
1985 but his spirited bustle and ruffle looks brought fun back 
into fashion and he was copied ad nauseam 
i dont try to create shock waves just for effect says 
lacroix im simply trying to show clothes more as id like to 
see them on the street which looks so sad nowadays compared with 
more daring styles paraded in past decades or centuries 
he denies trying to dazzle the fickle press who are totally 
blase in any case 
but he adds that we do feel we have to fill up a runway with 
the most spectacular clothes to attract a huge audience thats why 
ive chosen to hold my readytowear shows in my salon to create 
a more cozy couture ambience 
he says that what appears in magazines is often a distortion of 
what the clothes look like in real life you see extreme images 
fantasies created by fashion editors and photographers symbols of 
the era that are more cerebral inventions than reality 
its gaultier however who usually takes the cake for oddity 
even fashion guru john fairchild the headmaster of womens wear 
daily and w who has seen it all can be shocked at gaultiers 
gall 
in his book chic savages he wrote when i saw his models 
wearing bralike tops and garter belts i felt distaste for to me 
this was fashion bordering on the grotesque like a show in some 
sleazy hamburg bar 
however fairchild modestly admitted like many bemused 
fashionwatchers but then im a square or so im constantly 
being told

soft and subtle or bright and brassy this springs 
styles are feminine from sexy top to highhemmed bottom the 
silhouette for the early 1990s whether naughty or nice is softly 
rounded to the female form 
the modern suit look is often based on bi or multicolor 
combinations with main interest on curvy jackets that plunge 
around a full bust over tiny lean skirts or soft tulipwrapped 
styles 
flowered silks and solids of acid green hot coral or yellow 
combine gorgeously at ungaro though in his top readytowear the 
price tag is about 2000 for an outfit 
good news for many is that skirts in shops are often longer than 
the runway versions 
the most winning jackets may be long and doublebreasted 
shortie rounded boleros tuliprounded at hems with curvy 
sweetheart necklines or decorated with dazzling white lapels on 
navy karl lagerfelds asymmetrical scimitar shapes cut a handsome 
white swath on his dark suits 
coatdresses are very in this spring too often with 
contrasting silk cuffs and lapels a handsome navy version at guy 
laroche costs about 700 in paris slightly more in the states 
easy action is one big message of this seasons lines and if 
you dont go for the short skirts there are plenty of pants to 
choose from 
even there think short the shorts are adorable often full and 
quite dressy worn with jackets in a different color for a citified 
look top a pair of bermudas with a typically braided and 
goldbuttoned jacket and youve got the essence of the current 
nymphet style at chanel 
there are also plenty of long and easy pants cigaretteslim 
cropped trousers and bicycle tights or corsairs for those who like 
showing lean thighs at the beach 
transparency is a fresh look for next summer best at the house 
of chanel where designer lagerfeld likes to play around with chic 
long jackets in flesh tones of pink over similarly shaded little 
wisps of chiffon skirts peeping out underneath 
look also for appealing chiffon blouses layered with floppy bows 
to keep the look quite modest and dont forget the light organzas 
gianfranco ferre at dior is the couture master of this look his 
checked black and white flouncy short trapeze duster coats with a 
huge bow at the neck would be a stunning addition to a chic womans 
wardrobe 
since couture is impossibly expensive diors readytowear 
stylists have used the same idea but for a less costly result 
there are plenty of dream themes to spark up summer days and 
nights animal stripes and spots are happy denizens of the paris 
fashion zoo still tops at jeanlouis scherrer who sees spots in 
everything from suits to evanescent chiffon or georgette silk 
lateday wear 
sailor styles still abound on the bounding fashion main and the 
shops are already full of nautically inspired separates 
goldbuttoned blue or white jersey or linen pea jackets officers 
or mess jackets navy shorts and corsairs and striped tshirts or 
pants galore emanuelle khanhs sailor line looks very handsome in 
shades of burnt siena linen 
travelers will like the many versions of gabardine safari suits 
with laceup versions particularly handsome at saint laurent 
folklore made a cautious return to the runways but so far 
doesnt appear often in the shops though christian lacroix 
promises to do well with his vaguely provencal or indian 
multicolored cotton prints and shiny brocades 
in another vein yves saint laurents ruffled dotted carmen 
miranda dresses and jeweled tops borrowed from the bullring are 
opulent enough to attract all eyes at any kind of shindig 
his offshoulder white or navy draped greek dresses looked 
fetching as seen on models pulled down to bare a breast but are 
currently being sold and worn to cover the whole chest 
besides bits of titillating immodesty like that paris is also 
betting on warmweather holidays with lots of baremidriff ideas 
sarong skirts strapless bustier or backless tops for dressy 
lateday 
valentino teams a draped hotcolored print sarong skirt over 
1000 with neatly fitted jackets in shades of peacock turquoise or 
flame red linen jackets also pricey though similar styles can be 
found in less expensive labels 
fabrics for the feminine clothes are soft and sensual even 
linens and wools that never looked lighter cotton gabardine 
poplin and piques with flowery rather than waffled weaves have a 
fresh appeal 
organza is the big new dressy staple along with featherlight 
chiffon guipure lace and some wonderful bright gazars for evening 
wear 
the color palette is varied enough to suit anybody from the 
lowkeyed browns khakis and beige at claude montana to soft 
pastels and hot shocking pink or corals at many houses with 
daffodil yellow violet liqueur or acid green to vary the menu 
and as spring is synonymous with white and navy theyre already 
in the shops mainly in gabardine textured linen and silk blends 
with higher prices at couturiers like dior saint laurent and 
valentino slightly lower at hanae mori and guy laroche about 
650800 for a suit in paris somewhat more in the us 
now that luxury readytowear is excessively expensive copyists 
have been busily at work what to look for is highquality fabric 
and a cut that works right on you

body baring is above the waist shops are filled with such hot

shimmering sequins and worn with harem pants and sarong skirts to 
recreate the mystery of an arabian night

collections with the accent heavily on the holiday spirit thus 
along with their beach party clothes the windows are laden with 
yachting outfits from silk scarves printed with nautical motifs 
baggy highwaisted navy blue pants to sailor suit blouses complete

a reaction to public and corporate greed a 
resistance to high prices and the reality of the workplace are 
influencing american fashion today says a fashion consultant who 
has studied the effect of events on what people wear 
fashions are less flamboyant less ostentatious says laura 
sinderbrand an industry consultant and former director of the 
design laboratory at the fashion institute of technology in new 
york city this is in reaction to the greed we see around us 
opulence especially in evening wear has leveled off without 
the jewelencrusted fabrics and glitter of recent years 
american designers like geoffrey beene donna karan michael 
leavitt or gordon henderson are aiming their lines at working 
women who arent necessarily preoccupied with clothes but who want 
things that are efficient and creative she says 
much of the clothing you can wear all day it has to look 
right in the evening she says increased attention to 
accessories and versatility of designs enable working women to wear 
the same clothes at work and after hours 
the revival of the dress is one of the most significant trends 
in l990s fashion she thinks women are moving away from dressing 
like men we have a generation of women who are wearing dresses for 
the first time and theyre finding it an exciting new experience 
ms sinderbrand who advises industry organizations like the 
crafted with pride in usa council says she can chart the course 
of current fashion while walking to work along manhattans avenue 
of the americas or sixth avenue what i see being worn on sixth 
avenue is a marvelous barometer of fashion whats emerging are 
skirts in softer shapes dresses long coats and sweaters soft 
blouses with ruffles 
the careerist uniform of suit and bow tie worn by women with 
board room ambitions has been for the most part phased out which 
she attributes to their increased selfconfidence 
american consumers are balking at expensive extravagant 
clothes she says prices had been getting out of hand the 
working woman has a home family and other demands on her money 
designers are responding with well designed less expensive 
clothing and these designs are not to the european conception 
she says ms sinderbrand cites the strengths of american clothes 
they are well made fit well and are of good fabrics she says 
the major exception to the resistance to european influence is 
the continued adaptation of chanel design which she terms a 
homage to the legendary french designer whose styles 
effectively marked the end of victorian and the beginning of 20th 
century fashion 
what have been the benchmarks of american design during this 
century doing away with hobbled skirts and tightly laced 
corsets we are also more body and health conscious denims and 
cotton work clothes are worn by everyone 
this is the most dramatic statement we have made about 
ourselves

at the trendy limited apparel stores around the 
country winterweary shoppers have turned to polka dots and vivid 
floral patterns in sprucing up spring wardrobes 
other retailers report favorable responses to the warm weather 
fashions that started rolling out in late january racks and 
shelves are stocked with ample merchandise in the latest colors and 
styles 
even most of the department store chains operating under 
bankruptcy court supervision as is bloomingdales bon marche 
lazarus and others have adequate selections 
no consumer will have to go to church on easter sunday without 
a new dress or new suit said alan millstein publisher of a 
monthly newsletter for the fashion and retail industries theres 
no shortage of apparel around 
but traditional department stores face some of the toughest 
challenges yet in a continuing battle to maintain and build market 
share 
specialty retailers boasting deep assortments of apparel have 
pulled once diehard department store patrons and now are making an 
aggressive play for fashionconscious adolescents hoping hip 
youngsters will become devoted customers of the future 
small shops are winning over increasing numbers of affluent 
consumers fed up with the lackadaisical service at big stores 
they prefer the pampered attention boutiques offer 
offprice outlets selling national brands at discount such as 
marshalls also have made lasting inroads into the department store 
customer base 
mass merchandisers which have beefed up inventories to 
supplement their house brands with widely known labels are going 
after disillusioned department store shoppers 
the department store isnt the primary channel of distribution 
for many consumers anymore consultant thomas rauh said 
rauh director of retail consulting for the accounting firm 
ernst amp young said department stores formerly held a position of 
authority with the shopping public dictating fashion trends and 
buying patterns in many cases they have lost that authority 
position 
some retailers are aiming to wield more power in the department 
store industry 
thanks to a repositioning started a few years ago jc penney 
co inc has begun to attract people who previously wouldnt have 
thought about shopping at a penneys store the emphasis now is on 
apparel gone are the paints appliances and other hard goods 
that in the past might have distracted a career woman shopping for 
a business suit 
over the past decade as specialty stores particularly the 
limited increased their marketplace clout department stores pared 
down their offerings washers dryers and furniture no longer are 
standard fare at department stores 
a lot of them are getting out of the business of trying to be 
all things to all people said newton godnick chairman of the 
fashion buying and merchandising department at the fashion 
institute of technology in new york 
walter loeb a new yorkbased retail consultant foresees the 
process possibly accelerating he said department stores may opt 
for greater depth and do away with breadth more sizes and colors 
might be carried in a particular dress style but fewer styles might 
be carried overall for instance 
price competition also is rampant as department stores cater to 
shoppers now accustomed to the bargains at offprice chains the 
promotional pricecutting so conspicuous over the holiday season 
will probably continue but at a slower pace 
the financial problems of the department store chains operated 
by federated stores inc the us holding company of canadas 
debtravaged campeau corp spawned price wars particularly in some 
major markets in the peak prechristmas selling season many areas 
of the country though werent affected at all 
despite the challenges department stores arent dinosaurs 
godnick of the fashion institute of technology said he thinks of 
them as elephants moving slowing as they change their approach in 
an effort to keep old customers and attract new ones 
my impression is that the department stores will weather the 
storm he said but there is no question that theyre having 
some problems

for men who tend to spill burgundy on their blazers or pate on 
their pants theres good news from the male fashion front this 
spring 
according to one designer the new season will bring 
imaginative refreshing colors onto the scene such as asphalt 
blueberry postal blue and claret red there was no mention of 
the stainconcealment advantages 
for the ecologyminded there will be new smoky shades green 
influences and rich heather adds italian designer luciano 
franzoni 
other fashion consultants agree on the upsurge of the color 
factor 
and looking into the style crystal ball for the new decade 
randy ronning mens fashion director of jc penney co inc says 
men have warmed to new roles as consumers of fashion 
in the 1990s ronning explains this will be demonstrated 
by a new willingness to incorporate color into their business 
wardrobes as they have in casual dress and make greater use of 
stylish furnishings and accessories 
even more conservative dressers are updating their wardrobes 
and expanding the range of styles theyll wear theres been a 
dramatic increase in sales of patterned dress socks and fancy 
neckwear 
suits were the rule for a good part of the 80s but now 
sports coats many of them with bold patterns and vibrant colors 
are starting to make a comeback that will extend well into the new 
decade 
one particular sports coat the blazer has long been a 
fixture in many mens wardrobes 
some fashion experts credit the blazers social acceptability to 
dancer fred astaire the movies best dressed actor of the 40s and 
50s who wore the garment on and off the screen 
the jackets appeal was enhanced in the 60s by president john 
f kennedy who wore the blazer on trips to hyannis and 
occasionally at the white house 
the blazer is a chameleon garment that fits into any mans 
wardrobe perfectly notes mitchel nichnowitz president of botany 
500 this style is also a great weekend garment because it suits 
almost any dress requirement in any part of the country 
eliminating the need to pack a lot when traveling 
most recently he says the blazer has adjusted to fit the 90s 
fashion direction and has gone soft in construction giving it a 
more casual feeling 
to that end wearing the blazer with jeans and a tshirt is 
the most uptodate look that will take the 90s man to any 
offhours situation in great style he adds 
yet if the look is to be more formal the same blazer 
accompanied by dress shirt tie and trousers will feel just as 
comfortable at business meetings or out on the town 
in addition to the emphasis on color says italian designer 
franzoni the new season achieves greater refinement and 
sophistication in smooth worsteds soft wool blends blends with 
silk and multifiber mixtures 
fabrics focus on silk fiscose linen coolwool and cotton 
often in multiple combinations 
the emphasis at brooks brothers which claims to be the nations 
oldest clothing retailer is more conservative 
mainstays of the companys spring suit collection are rich 
lightweight wools with ultrasoft hands in classic gray chalk 
stripes and subtle plaids according to peter marsh vice president 
for mens tailored clothing 
but also in evidence he points out are charcoal blues muted 
olives and black and white plaids 
in a set of rules aimed at both men and women brooks brothers 
suggests that both avoid clothing trends 
consider the untimely demise of the latest miniskirt craze 
men are not exempt watch the size of your lapels and the width 
of your ties it advises

the working woman often confounds the 
expectations of clothing retailers says a miami university 
marketing professor 
the working woman is two different people when she works she 
dresses one way but when she plays she can be exactly the opposite 
wild daring ultracasual ultrasloppy says mel schneck 
visiting executive professor of retailing at the university 
this refusal to fit into a single mold both confuses stores and 
make marketing to women more challenging he says and the working 
woman continues to increase her clout at the cash register shes 
a smart spender shes knowledgeable she knows names she knows 
looks she is aware and educated she also needs clothes to enhance 
her position at the firm 
schneck thinks the dress for success formulas of the 
mideighties which included bankers pinstripe suits are on the 
wane that means a higher percentage of the fashion dollar is 
shifting back toward dresses increasingly favored by career women

the demands of womens careers and 
work pushed home sewing to the side during the l970s but the 
search for quality contributed to its rise again in the l980s 
according to a purdue university professor 
working women want better clothes than theyre finding in the 
stores and if they dont have time to sew themselves they look 
for someone else to do it for them says lois gotwals assistant 
professor and extension specialist in the universitys consumer 
sciences and retailing department 
those who have a talent for sewing are making a business for 
themselves by doing alterations and making items for other 
people she says 
all you have to do is send out a few flyers put a sign out 
and youre swamped i know of one woman who says if she could sew 
for 12 weddings a year she could make about 50000 
the cost of clothing which has risen sharply in the last few 
years also contributes to the renaissance of home sewing which 
was at an alltime high in the l960s before slumping during the 
next decade she points out that fabric and notions for a 
topquality lined wool or silk jacket cost about 7080 while a 
comparable readymade version couldnt be bought for less than 
400 a lined wool skirt priced at 80 in stores will cost about 
25 to make 
gotwals says that more people also are sewing for the home 
bedspreads curtains draperies and table linens 
more than two years ago gotwals with the help of purdues 
continuing education division began compiling a data base with 
information about where to find fabrics notions and sewing 
equipment a resource list based on this data is available to home 
sewers for 750 for more information contact gotwals at 317

granted it didnt come off a paris runway and you wont find 
it in wall street board rooms but it is one of the most pervasive 
and constant fashions of the age the tshirt 
according to industry figures of 10 billion americans spend 
each year on active sportswear 35 billion goes for tshirts 
whether plain imprinted lengthened into tshirt dresses or used 
as nightwear the industry claims that in the l980s 200 million 
americans regularly wore tshirts 
tshirts have moved up to high fashion and high profits 
says milt anglin general merchandising manager for tshirts plus 
a national chain of stores specializing in what the trade now calls 
imprintable sportswear 
that category now covers sweatpants hats and workshirts but 
the tshirt is the mainstay 
and printed shirts are being improved the rubbery hot transfer 
which the consumer had to avoid ironing over has been gradually 
replaced with better printing techniques decorations are often 
added and some are rendered in spin art an advanced form of

the ubiquitous sneaker is the king of the road not to mention 
the walk the playing court the home and just about anywhere a 
pair of feet can go 
ninetythree percent of all americans over the age of 12 own at 
least one pair of athletic shoes and 87 percent wear them 
regularly says the athletic footwear association 
the organization commissioned what it says is the first major 
study of the market for athletic footwear and discovered that the 
average american owns 25 pairs of athletic shoes a figure that is 
constant among different segments of the population men women 
teens blacks and whites but young blacks 13 to 24 years old may 
be the trendsetters the study shows that 33 percent of them own 
four or more pairs of sneakers compared to 24 percent of all other 
categories in that age group 
sales in l988 reached 97 billion compared with the 42 
billion figure recorded in l983 
its bigger than most people in the industry ever imagined 
says gregg hartley afa executive director athletic shoes are 
mainstream footwear and the future of the industry depends on how 
well the companies build on that position 
the study was underwritten by the afa and the sporting goods 
manufacturers association in an effort to learn more about 
potential customer preferences 
the market for sneakers is enormous but it is also highly 
segmented and complex says mel roboff who directs planning 
research and business development for converse 
among other findings 
most americans think of sneakers as casual footwear and 
almost no one wears them only for athletic activities 
they want comfort and good fit appearance and fashion mean 
less than they do for casual nonathletic shoes 
despite specialpurpose shoes for a specific sport or 
activity a large number of people who say they exercise regularly 
do so in shoes other than those designed for that activity 
those surveyed said they spent an average of 3013 on their 
most recent pair of athetic shoes the top price they would be 
willing to pay averaged 4196

they are well the very pearls of your jewelry collection 
pearls look right with both daytine and evening wear points out 
marilu klar director of the jewelry department of gumps stores 
based in san francisco and since this is investment jewelry 
youll want to know some basics about them before buying 
ms klar advises checking lustre uniformity surface smoothness 
and color fine pearls she says are lustrous with light 
reflecting in soft glints of pink and blue avoid dull looking 
pearls with yellow or greenish colors make sure the pearls in any 
single piece are compatibly shaped and sized and the surfaces 
should always be smooth without pit marks or cracks then pick the 
color that suits you iridescent pink and blue pinkish rose 
cream pure white blue ranging from pale to dove gray and black 
which ranges from gray to black with overtones of red blue green 
or brown 
select a color that works well with your skin color ms klar 
says she notes that european women usually prefer iridescents 
americans and japanese like rose and middle eastern and south 
american women prefer cream 
pearls should be strung on silk thread knotted between each 
pearl have them restrung when the thread becomes stretched or 
soiled 
other maintenance includes avoiding contact with perfumes and 
makeup since these may damage the surface of the pearl which is 
organic clean in a mild solution of unscented soap and water or 
even safer baking soda and water rinse thoroughly never use 
ammonia or harsh commercial detergents

anthony dambrosio a tourneau vice president advises 
collectors to look for three things in selecting this type of 
timepiece limited availability distinctive style and quality in

workers at an international paper co mill are 
awaiting results of an unusual election in which striking union 
members voted on a contract offered to their nonunion replacements 
the contract ballots were being sent by certified mail to the 
unions tennessee headquarters today to be counted gorden brehm 
an assistant to the president of the united paperworkers 
international union said it could be four months before results 
are known 
brehm said the vote by upiu local 14 is subject to a pool vote 
by upiu members from 19 locations throughout the country some of 
those locals will not be voting on it until their own local 
contract votes are held he said 
maine members of local 14 and the international brotherhood of 
firemen and oilers said in recent days the contract proposal was 
likely to be rejected 
most of the roughly 1100 hourly mill employees who would be 
affected by the contract were hired as replacement workers during a 
sometimesviolent strike that ended in october 1988 the work force 
includes about 70 former union members labeled superscabs by 
members who crossed the picket lines during the strike 
i think everybody expects the same outcome a no vote 
ronald roy a member of local 14 said before the sunday vote 
roy who said he was recalled to his old job at ip last week is 
among 137 mill employees who are members of upiu or the firemen and 
oilers union 
also eligible to vote were about 750 other members who claim 
rights to be rehired 
ip spokesman brad peters called sundays vote a unique set of 
circumstances to some extent unprecedented 
the company began proceedings before the national labor 
relations board more than two years ago to decertify the union 
because the matter is unresolved the union continues to represent 
workers at the mill 
local 14 president william meserve recently described the latest 
contract talks as a charade in which the company dictated the terms 
and refused to consider proposals by the union 
in february ip offered what it described as its best offer a 
package retroactive to last october and providing pay raises 
totaling 6 12 percent over three years a companysponsored 
retirement savings plan and an increase in the company contribution 
to the health insurance plan 
the proposed contract would replace an openended pact that the 
company imposed unilaterally during the strike

a union official said greyhounds 
striking drivers have been like choirboys and did not fire a 
gunshot that injured eight passengers on a bus operated by a 
replacement driver 
the shot fired apparently from an interstate 95 overpass 
showered passengers on the jacksonvilletodaytona beach run with 
glass and other debris sunday night said sheriffs spokesman steve 
weintraub no arrests were made 
everybody was hollering im hit im hit said passenger 
ronald hill 
eight of the 41 passengers were injured but none of the 
injuries appeared lifethreatening authorities said they were 
taken to hospitals and two people underwent surgery for shrapnel 
wounds 
michael rogers of atlanta a passenger who was wounded in the 
neck and chest was being treated at st lukes hospital 
i dont think they greyhound should run their lines while 
theyre having a situation like this going on or at least warn the 
general public that a situation like that might occur he said 
a greyhound bus headed into hartford conn was hit by gunfire 
this morning connecticut state police said 
the shooting occurred on interstate 84 in farmington conn 
just west of hartford at about 1045 am said state police 
spokesman adam berluti 
one passenger dondi maheux 22 who was heading to maine said 
most passengers on the bus were asleep when the shooting occurred 
i just heard a small pop it sounded maybe just like a 
firecracker going off maheux said 
investigators at the union station terminal where the bus 
arrived about 11 am were talking to passengers the bus had what 
appeared to be a bullet hole on the drivers side in the baggage 
area 
greyhound was offering a 25000 reward for information leading 
to the arrest and conviction of those responsible for the florida 
shooting company chairman fred g currey said 
currey and company president frank schmieder traveled today from 
greyhounds dallas headquarters to jacksonville where they visited 
the hospitalized passengers and a hotel where uninjured passengers 
stayed overnight company spokesman george gravley said 
this morning the two executives also were in the terminal 
talking to passengers and planned to ride buses today from 
jacksonville to miami and orlando gravley said 
the shooting came on the eve of a meeting called in washington 
by federal mediators with officials of the striking amalgamated 
council of greyhound local unions in a bid to end the strike 
the union which represents 6300 drivers and more than 3000 
office and maintenance workers went on strike march 2 there have 
been scattered violent incidents since including a striker crushed 
to death by a bus operated by a replacement driver in redding 
calif and shots fired at buses in chicago and phoenix 
asked if sunday nights shooting was strikerelated weintraub 
said i think it is 
but bill nicholson an executive board member of the 
jacksonville local of the amalgamated council of greyhound local 
unions said as far as im concerned it wasnt one of our 
strikers 
theyve been like choirboys he said 
in dallas union spokesman jeffrey nelson echoed that view we 
believe its important for the public to understand that this is a 
strike against the company not against the traveling public 
nelson said 
the bus was on a highway about 10 miles south of downtown 
jacksonville when it was hit weintraub said a newly hired 
replacement driver was at the wheel greyhound said 
i yelled for everybody to get down and i told the bus driver 
to put his accelerator pedal to the floor said passenger kevin 
covington 
the unidentified bus driver pulled the bus in safely at a 
convenience store about two miles away the stores night manager 
roger ennis said passengers covered in blood ran in and told him 
to call 911 
earlier sunday greyhound announced it has restored bus service 
to an additional 120 communities that lost regular runs when the 
strike began 
company spokeswoman elizabeth hale said greyhound added routes 
sunday in parts of the southeast and southwest after a new class of 
drivers graduated from training courses but she said she didnt 
know how many of the 9500 communities served before the strike 
were being served as of sunday night 
on saturday greyhound carried 38 percent of the number of 
passengers it did on the same saturday a year ago and operated 
onethird of the number of departing buses ms hale said figures 
for sunday would reflect the larger number of routes but were 
unavailable until today she said 
greyhound has been able to serve big cities virtually without 
interruption since the strike began with sundays additions 
including smaller cities and towns ms hale said

the bush administration today signaled an 
unexpected willingness to look at a plan by the democratic chairman 
of the house ways and means committee that includes new taxes and a 
social security freeze 
we think theres some room to talk white house spokesman 
marlin fitzwater said of the plan unveiled by rep dan 
rostenkowski dill over the weekend 
rostenkowskis deficitreduction proposal combines a series of 
tax increases and spending cuts with a oneyear hold on benefit 
increases for the nations 39 million social security recipients 
president bush has long voiced opposition to any form of tax 
increase and has strongly criticized previous democratic proposals 
to modify the social security formula 
todays statement does not represent a retreat from those 
positions or a major change in administration thinking fitzwater 
said he said the rostenkowski package has significant 
weaknesses 
but at the same time fitzwater called rostenkowskis proposal 
thoughtful and said his plan deserves some credit 
we dont want to pour cold water on a plan we may want to swim 
around in for a while the spokesman said 
fitzwater said the rostenkowski package comes up with 
signicant savings that should be discussed 
rostenkowski said sunday that a oneyear freeze in social 
security benefits and other entitlement programs could cut the 
governments deficit by 9 billion in 1991 
he said the savings would total nearly 46 billion over the next 
five years because the oneyear freeze would hold down the base on 
which subsequent increases are calculated 
his plan also calls for higher taxes on cigarettes and alcohol 
extending the 33percent tax bracket to the countrys highest 
income earners and doing away with the grammrudman 
deficitreduction law 
on the issue of taxes fitzwater said our general attitude 
is the less taxation the better 
told this seemed to be a retreat from bushs nonewtaxes 
proclamations of the past fitzwater said im not signaling any 
action on our part except to say this gives us a basis for 
discussion 
he said he did not want to go over the rostenkowski plan 
itembyitem at this time once you get into specifics were 
going to be negative he said 
if were all going to share in the responsibility of bringing 
our deficit down i think weve all got to share in it 
rostenkowski said on cbs face the nation program 
he said a 1991 freeze in social security benefits and other 
government programs coupled with new taxes on cigarettes alcohol 
gasoline and the wealthy could reduce the deficit by more than a 
halftrillion dollars over the next five years and produce a 
balanced budget by 1994 
in fiscal 1991 which begins oct 1 rostenkowski said his 
total package would cut the deficit from the 161 billion as 
projected by the congressional budget office to 106 billion 
the next year he said the deficit would fall to 39 billion 
under his proposal instead of 124 billion as projected by the cbo 
rostenkowski said he expected a verbal hazing from both 
democrats and republicans for suggesting a freeze in politically 
sensitive social security benefits but somebody has to start 
saying it he said 
in the silence of the chambers of the house of representatives 
and even in the senate members will say that these things should 
be done he said i hope im laying the blueprint for the 
future all youve got to do is talk straight to the american 
people and theyll respond 
rostenkowski suggested the package as an alternative to bushs 
proposed capital gains tax cut and counterproposals by democrats to 
cut social security taxes or restore tax breaks for individual 
savings and retirement accounts 
bushs fiscal 1991 budget and the grammrudman deficitreduction 
law call for a balanced budget in fiscal 1993 but the cbo says 
administration budgetwriters adopted unrealistically rosy economic 
assumptions 
the grammrudman law meanwhile is almost certain to be 
revamped again this year rostenkowski said grammrudman should be 
abolished 
in addition to the spending freeze and new consumer taxes 
rostenkowski would earmark the entire peace dividend from an 
annual 3 percent cut in defense spending before inflation 
adjustments for deficit reduction he estimated the savings from 
that at 150 billion over five years 
rostenkowski also would freeze for oneyear inflation 
adjustments in the tax code including the indexing of personal 
exemptions and brackets but excluding the earned income tax credit 
for lowincome families 
the impact on individual taxpayers would be modest he said 
but the aggregate revenue gain would be substantial 50 billion 
over five years 
eliminated entirely under his proposal would be the bubble 
that enables individuals with incomes above 109100 and families 
with incomes over 185730 to pay an effective tax rate of 28 
percent on each additional dollar received it would raise 44 
billion over five years 
individuals now making between 47050 and 109100 and families 
with incomes between 78400 and 185730 now pay an effective tax 
rate of 33 percent on their marginal income rostenkowskis plan 
would extend the 33 percent rate to incomes above those amounts 
rostenkowski did not specify how much he would raise gasoline 
tobacco and alcohol taxes other than to say they could provide a 
total of 100 billion in new revenues for the government over the 
next five years 
but he said on the cbs program that he envisioned the federal 
tax on gasoline rising from the current 9 cents a gallon to 20 
cents or 25 cents a federal gasoline tax of 50 cents a gallon 
would never pass congress he said

the government put a value of 
623 million on aerolineas argentinas the stateowned carrier it 
plans to sell this year newspapers reported monday 
in a separate development the governmentowned telephone 
company entel which also is to be sold was valued at around 19 
billion 
eightyfive percent of aerolineas argentinas will be offered for 
529 million of which at least 220 million must be paid in cash 
the rest could come from debtequity swaps the financial daily el 
cronista comercial reported the newspaper cited government data 
disclosed over the weekend 
the airline currently owes 741 million to foreign banks and 
financial institutions plus 127 million in interest that was 
overdue last dec 31 
bids are to be opened april 30 and the winner announced in late 
june 
of the remaining 15 percent of the airline the government would 
keep 5 percent leaving 10 percent to be purchased by employees 
entel director maria julia alsogaray recently told congress that 
a value of slightly more than 1 billion has been put on the 60 
percent of the telephone company that is for sale 
a minimum 214 million must be paid in cash for entel and the 
remainder could be covered by debtequity swaps according to 
another financial daily ambito comercial 
the public works ministry said last month that companies that 
have expressed interest in entel include midland bank plc of 
britain societa finanziaria telefonica of italy and nynex corp 
the phone company covering new york state and new england 
the winner of the bid is scheduled to be announced in late june 
with the sale expected to be completed in early october 
some details of both privatizations were still unclear 
including how much if anything the buyers would be required to 
invest and whether there would be restrictions such as a ban on 
immediate resale or a limitation on foreign ownership 
the peronist party government of president carlos menem has 
pledged to sell government companies to attract foreign investment 
and technology and to reduce operating losses for decades 
argentina has printed currency to cover the losses fueling 
inflation 
the proposed sales are opposed by labor unions and nationalists 
who maintain the government should own the airline railroad 
electricity and other companies and by political groups that claim 
the government is selling them for too little money 
leopoldo moreau leader of the opposition civic radical union 
called the proposed sale of entel a rockbottom price for one of 
the few stateowned companies that can attract genuine investment 
the radical government of raul alfonsin in power from december 
1983 through last july tried to sell aerolineas argentinas and 
entel in late 1988 and was blocked by congress which was 
dominated by the peronist party then as it is now 
under alfonsin 40 percent of the airline would have been sold 
to scandanavian airlines system for 204 million and 40 percent of 
entel would have been sold to spains telephone company 
telefonica for a reported 1 billion

charles e sporck national semiconductors president and chief 
executive officer said the most recent loss was expected 
the third quarter is historically a challenging one for us 
incorporating a seasonal slowdown in sales along with the annual 
holiday shutdown of our production facilities sporck said in 
addition our performance was affected by continued pricing 
pressure in certain product areas 
the products most affected by lower prices were eproms

we are encouraged by the yeartodate performance and are 
optimistic that we will achieve a level of full year growth which 
is consistent with our historical trend said heinz chairman

rorer group inc and frances 
rhonepoulenc sa have signed a 17 billion agreement to create one 
of the worlds largest pharmaceutical companies the companies 
jointly announced monday 
the agreement would combine the surbuban philadelphiabased 
rorer with the parisbased rhonepoulencs human pharmaceutical 
operations in a new firm called rhonepoulenc rorer inc 
the merger is the latest example of consolidation in the drug 
industry and is aimed at lowering research costs and gaining global 
markets 
last year smithkline beckman corp of philadelphia merged with 
britains beecham group plc to form smithkline beecham and 
bristolmyers co of new york acquired squibb corp of princeton 
nj to form bristolmyers squibb co 
the latest transaction will encompass several stages with 
rhonepoulenc initially offering 78 per share for 501 percent of 
rorers 216 million shares a cost of about 842 million 
a tender offer at that price values the entire company at 1685 
billion 
following the tender offer rhonepoulenc will transfer its 
pharmaceuticals business and issue contingent value rights to 
rorer with the number corresponding to nontendered rorer shares 
in exchange rorer will take on 265 million of rhonepoulenc 
debt and acquire the french groups existing us pharmaceutical 
subsidiary for 20 million 
rorer also will create 24 million new shares giving 
rhonepoulenc 68 percent of rorers share capital comprising some 
673 million shares 
rhonepoulenc expects to acquire the 68 percent of rorer by june 
1990 
the tender offer will begin friday rhonepoulenc said the 
companies had announced their intentions to merge earlier this year 
in trading on the new york stock exchange rorer was the most 
active issue rising 3 a share to 6587 on volume of nearly 23 
million shares 
the agreement does not include other portions of the french 
companys healh business such as serums and vaccines veterinary 
medicines animal nutrition and rhonepoulencs interest in roussel 
uclaf sa 
through rhonepoulenc rorer we will achieve our mission of 
becoming a top 10 researchbased pharmaceutical company said 
robert e cawthorn chairman president and chief executive 
officer of rorer cawthorn has been named to the same positions in 
the new company which will be based in fort washington 
the company expects to have annual sales exceeding 3 billion 
he said 
the human pharmaceutical business of rhonepoulenc had sales of 
19 billion in 1989 while rorer had 12 billion the companies 
said 
analyst ron nordmann of painewebber group inc said it is too 
early to make any judgments on the new company 
in terms of the details the companys potential earning power 
is still up in the air he said we need to get more numbers on 
the company before we are able to do any earnings assessment 
rorer is best known for its maalox antacid rhonepoulenc is in 
the top 10 in the european pharmaceutical market but has no direct 
marketing in the united states or japan 
that french company has no presence in the us then 
overnight they are in said analyst michael martorelli of janney 
montgomery scott inc in philadelphia and rorer gets the french 
companys drugs and adds somebody elses research to it own 
he said the merger kills any takeover rumors swirling around 
rorer 
now with a large partner theyll no longer be subject to the 
rumors he said management can stop worrying about that it 
seemed like everytime they turned around there was another takeover 
rumor or question

atampt signed an agreement monday to share a key 
ingredient used to make advanced semiconductors under the auspices 
of sematech the consortium of computer chip makers formed to boost 
us semiconductor competitiveness 
under the agreement american telephone amp telegraph co will 
allow a division of olin corp to make and sell a chemical used to 
etch extremely detailed electronic circuitry on chips 
the chemical called deep uv resist allows chip designers 
to pack a greater number of circuits on chips than current 
technologies 
in making chips circuitry is etched on silicon wafers using a 
lightsensitive chemical or resist and a mask whose function 
is similar to that of a negative in photography 
atampt bell laboratories has invented a version of the chemical 
that is used with ultraviolet light instead of the visible light 
currently used 
however olin will not be the first company to market 
ultravioletbased resist shipley co inc of newton mass has 
been selling ultraviolet resist for several years and it is being 
used by chip makers to test the new technology said eric alling a 
marketing manager for the company 
were very encouraged atampt has elected to expand the viabilty 
of deep uv technology alling said 
the uv resist can produce highly complex computer chips with 
circuits as thin as 03 micrometers or about 400 times smaller 
than a human hair atampt said 
such dimensions are essential for packing more processing 
power speed and memory into the chips of the future said arno 
penzias vice president of research for bell labs 
circuitry on most chips today is 1 to 12 microns wide while it 
reaches 08 microns in more advanced chips 
atampt said it also is working on two other advanced technologies 
for making even more complex computer chips xray lithography and 
electronbeam techniques 
japanese chip makers are believed to be concentrating on 
ultraviolet lithography as the next generation of technology while 
also studying the xray technique european makers are actively 
exploring xrays industry analysts said 
perhaps what this may indicate is that the use of xray 
techniques may be further down the road than the japanese 
thought analyst jay ritter of duff amp phelps inc in chicago said 
of the atampt pact 
adopting either technique would require an enormous investment 
in new chip manufacturing equipment but the xray technology would 
be more costly than the ultraviolet technique said mark 
fitzgerald an analyst with dataquest inc of san jose calif the 
research firm believes ultraviolet etching will be used for the 
next generation of semiconductors 
sematech officials hailed the atampt agreement 
the deep uv resist is the future in semiconductor 
manufacturing and will produce semiconductors that compete in the 
global market in terms of performance and price said robert 
noyce president and chief executive of the consortium 
sematech was founded by 14 us semiconductor manufacturers 
including atampt under the sponsorship of the us government which 
splits the cost of the consortium with the companies

national intergroup inc criticized a 
dissident investor groups plan to liquidate the company saying it 
is sketchy illdefined and illconceived 
the pittsburghbased distribution company sent a strongly worded 
letter to shareholders over the weekend in response to centaur 
partners efforts to induce them to change key parts of the 
companys bylaws all 12 national intergroup directors signed the 
letter 
centaur cannot seek control of the board of directors at julys 
annual meeting unless shareholders first agree to increase the 
boards size to 15 it must get 80 percent of the stockholders to 
agree to the change according to a delaware court ruling made last 
week 
centaur is the companys largest stockholder with 165 percent 
of outstanding shares it began its efforts to change the bylaws 
last week saying it wanted to elect a new board that would 
liquidate the company for the benefit of shareholders 
the centaur group national intergroup says consists of 
takeover artists who have no proven track record in running public 
companies 
it also attacked centaurs plan as a scheme to enrich the 
groups investment bankers who stand to make 27 million up front 
for a threeyear contract and the promise of more fees later when 
assets are sold 
centaur has contended it could fetch 2934 per share and 
perhaps several dollars more by selling national intergroup in 
pieces the company expressed doubt centaur could get those 
proceeds in a fire sale 
in trading monday on the new york stock exchange national 
intergroup rose 25 cents a share to 1675 
centaur is best known for its unsuccessful hostile takeover bid 
last year for pennwalt corp a philadelphiabased chemicals and

a former food lion employee filed a 
federal class action lawsuit against the fastgrowing supermarket 
chain monday alleging the company has illegally denied workers 
retirement and health benefits 
company officials said the benefit plans are administered 
according to law and called the suit an attempt by the united food 
and commercial workers union to pressure the company into 
recognizing the union the company is nonunion 
the union has a history of creating these lawsuits and the 
most mileage they get out of it is in media coverage that they have 
filed it said food lion inc spokesman mike mozingo in a 
telephone interview from the companys salisbury nc 
headquarters 
food lion has 675 stores in 10 states from delaware to florida 
including 81 in south carolina 
the lawsuit filed by former employee rickey bryant of west 
columbia alleges the company used a scheme to terminate employees 
to prevent them from receiving full or partial profitsharing 
benefits a program which serves as the companys retirement plan 
in addition it alleges employees are unlawfully discharged on 
the grounds of gross misconduct so the company does not have to 
continue providing health benefits for employees and their families 
the suit said those who have the most to gain when a nonvested 
worker leaves and forfeits profit sharing are the longestserving 
and highestpaid employees of the company 
the suit filed in us district court in charleston claims 
bryants termination in 1988 after nine years with the company was 
a pretext to deny him 55 percent of the approximately 67000 he 
had in profit sharing 
as of december 1987 the profitsharing plan had 20907 active 
participants and 192 million in assets but only 81 people were 
fully vested and only 2956 were partially vested the suit said 
because of the high turnover rate at food lion there are many 
thousands of employees who are or have been participants in the 
plan and who will derive no benefit the suit charges 
among the damages the lawsuit is seeking from food lion are 
bryants reinstatement and restoration of back pay and lost health 
and profitsharing plan for bryant and other defendants 
nicholas clark the assistant general counsel for the united 
food and commercial workers international who drafted the lawsuit 
said the union came to bryants aid even though food lion is a 
nonunion company 
he said the class action lawsuit could potentially involve 
thousands of former employees and millions of dollars in benefits 
the suit has much more significance than just food lion 
clark added he said it could affect any employer with a high 
turnover and who structures profit sharing so workers do not get 
their benefits 
mozingo said he could not comment on the specifics of the 
complaint because he had not seen a copy of the lawsuit 
more than 21000 of the chains 42000 employees are fully or 
partially vested in the profit sharing plan ten years ago the 
chain which is opening over 100 stores annually employed only 
4849 workers 
a lot of people working for food lion have not been here that 
long because we simply didnt have that many stores open mozingo 
said 
he said the union has tried unsuccessfully to organize the chain 
and they have not been able to get to first base with our 
employees 
they look at our 40000 employees and see these people arent 
sending in dues every month mozingo said they look to 
discredit the company and stop our growth

energy futures prices fell monday amid concern 
over a high opec oil production estimate and unseasonably warm 
weather in europe and the eastern united states 
it was the fifth straight day of declines in the markets for 
crude oil heating oil and gasoline 
the contract for april delivery of west texas intermediate the 
key grade of us crude oil fell 19 cents to 2024 a 42gallon

the report by the middle east economic survey said that opec 
production may have hit 24 million barrels a day last month 
800000 to 1 million barrels higher than estimated by the

the lack of interest in crude is putting a lot of selling 
pressure on the market said john hill of merrill lynch energy 
futures

united states weakened demand for home heating oil analysts said 
in addition gasoline futures prices were down because of supply 
concerns with a surplus of gasoline in new york harbor

cents to 5386 cents a gallon on the new york mercantile exchange

the ohio supreme court on monday granted a 
delay in arguments in the states appeal from two criminal 
convictions stemming from the collapse of home state savings bank 
the court said oral arguments involving former home state owner 
marvin warner and a former president of the thrift david schiebel 
will be rescheduled no later than june 6 if the state and the 
defendants lawyers meet a prehearing briefing schedule 
arguments had been scheduled for march 27 but special 
prosecutor lawrence kane jr of cincinnati is requesting the delay 
pending disposition of some other matters in the case attorney 
general anthony j celebrezze jr said 
cincinnatibased home state collapsed on march 8 1985 four 
days after esm government securities inc of fort lauderdale fla 
was declared insolvent home state lost 144 million through its 
securities transactions with esm 
the failure of home state led to ohios savings and loan 
industry crisis of that year 
warner schiebel and another former home state president burton 
bongard were convicted on march 2 1987 of state charges related 
to home states collapse 
warner was convicted of nine felonies six counts of 
misapplying about 14 million in bank money through unauthorized 
payments to esm and three counts of securities violations he was 
acquitted of 76 other counts 
schiebel was found guilty of three securities violations and

unauthorized transfer of funds 
warner had been sentenced to 3 years in prison and fined 22 
million and schiebel was sentenced to six months both are free on 
bond pending their appeals

4year prison sentence he was released from prison in july 1989

ibm on monday introduced a computer system for 
banks that caputures electronic images of checks and electronically 
reads and records their amount 
the system should greatly reduce the amount of time and money 
spent by banks in manually entering into computers the amount of 
checks and in storing and collating the checks international 
business machines corp said 
ibm also said banks could improve customer service by providing 
images of actual checks along with their customers monthly 
statements 
the system developed in cooperation with six major banks 
employs imaging scanners that can take an electronic picture of 
checks at up to 2400 checks per minute 
the system employs compression technology that reduces the 
amount of data that must be stored to capture an image of a check 
or other document compression technology is needed to allow 
existing computer equipment to handle the vast amount of data 
needed to store an image as opposed to storing data such as 
figures 
the equipment can electronically read the amount of money a 
check is written for either hand printed or typewritten in 
about half the cases ibm said when the equipment is unsure of a 
figure it will display an image of the check on a screen for a 
bank employee to verify the figure or manually enter it into the 
computer 
ibms main competitor in the bank check imaging market is unisys 
corp said nick allen an analyst with gartner group inc a 
consulting firm in stamford conn 
he said the market for the equipment should be promising as 
banks work to limit the labor involved in processing checks 
weve only recently reached the processing power capability to 
do this kind of thing he said 
check processing of banks already is a major market for ibm 
he added what this does is stimulate demand for hardware

nortek inc has reached a settlement 
with the securities and exchange commission over a dispute 
involving a fourday delay in filing a form with the government 
disclosing its investment in another company 
nortek said it agreed to a consent decree under which it will 
pay 503000 into a fund to reimburse any rexham corp stockholders 
who may have lost money as a result of the delay in notifying the 
sec of its investment 
the incident occurred more than three years ago 
richard j harris nortek vice president and treasurer said his 
company purchased more than 5 percent of the outstanding shares of 
rexham in 1986 
the sec said nortek delayed by four days filing a form that 
detailed the purchase as is required when a company or individual 
buys more than 5 percent of another company 
nortek filed an untimely false and misleading statement of 
its rexham investment said mary mccue of the sec nortek had 
purchased 62000 shares of rexham stock in 1986 but a form the 
company filed with the sec did not disclose properly norteks 
position and their intent regarding rexham ms mccue said 
nortek sold its investments in rexham of pineville nc in 
1987 harris said 
nortek neither admitted nor denied that it had broken any laws 
or regulations as a result of its rexham investment he said it 
agreed to the settlement to close the case and avoid further legal 
expenses he said 
under the terms of the judgment filed in federal court monday 
any rexham stockholders who sold shares during the fourday period 
and who lost money can seek repayment through the fund nortek is 
establishing any money that is not claimed will revert to the us 
treasury 
nortek filed its consent to a proposed judgment in order to 
bring an end to the continuous drain on management time and to 
avoid incurring additional legal fees said ralph r pappito 
chairman and chief executive officer we are pleased to put this 
bit of our history behind us 
harris said he did not know how much in interest will be paid by 
nortek 
nortek manufactures and markets residential and commercial 
building products and commercial ventilating and air conditioning 
systems its stock is traded on the new york stock exchange

federal regulators should give new thought to 
sweeping changes in us stock markets including moving trading 
from actionpacked exchange floors to flickering computer screens 
a congressional report said monday 
specifically the general accounting office congress auditing 
and investigative agency said the securities and exchange 
commission should consider a proposal to repeal a new york stock 
exchange rule requiring trades of most listed stocks to be executed 
on the exchange floor 
a rule that forbids afterhours trading of listed stocks in 
effect forcing such trading to foreign exchanges also should be 
reviewed the report said 
trading rules were eased in 1979 to permit offfloor trading of 
newly listed stocks but a decade later most stocks still were 
initially listed before 1979 trades of 89 of the new york stock 
exchanges 100 most active shares still must be routed through the 
exchange floor 
the gao noting the rapid evolution of computer and 
communications technology said it is time for the sec to 
reconsider rules banning most offfloor trading 
the sec disagreed saying its 1979 study of offfloor trading 
was complex and that it would not dismantle the floor system until 
market participants determine the resulting new system would be 
better than the old method 
critics contend that the current structure of the market 
including the use of trading floors and specialist brokers who 
make a market in the stock restricts price competition 
supporters of the current system however argue that a central 
location for trading preserves the benefits of an auction market 
the sec agreed that a review of afterhours trading was in order 
even though in 1986 the commission rejected a recommendation from 
it staff that the agency ask the new york stock exchange to 
consider permitting afterhours trading 
as a result exchange member brokers and dealers who wish 
to trade exchangelisted stocks when us markets are closed must 
do so in foreign markets the gao said 
the report dated monday was delivered to the senate banking 
committee and the house energy and commerce committee

atampt announced monday that all of its 
newly manufactured telephones and answering machines will be packed 
in 100 percent biodegradable material a move expected to reduce 
the companys distribution and waste disposal costs 
the new packaging which uses corrugated cardboard in place of 
bulkier foam to protect the companys line of small consumer 
products will make its packaged products about one quarter smaller 
than their predecessors said lee blitch atampts director of 
advertising and packaging 
he also said the packaging will disintegrate easily in landfills 
we will save on shipping and waste hauling costs because 
everything will be 25 to 30 percent smaller he said this is 
also welcome by retailers who will be able to stock more of the 
smaller products on their shelves 
the new packaging standards apply only to atampts line of small 
consumer products and will not affect such large items as personal 
computers office switchboard systems and other large components 
said atampt spokeswoman lynn newman 
last year the company announced it had eliminated all sources 
of chloroflourocarbons known as cfcs from its packaging 
materials cfcs contained in such materials as styrofoam and 
aerosol propellants are blamed for the deterioration of the 
earths protective ozone layer 
the new yorkbased company which reported 361 billion in 
revenues for 1989 maintains a team of environmental engineers who 
work with its bell laboratories subsidiary to improve packaging 
techniques eliminate hazardous materials and encourage recycling 
ms newman said 
the changes were made she said because the old foam inserts 
that protected cordless and corded telephones and answering 
machines were difficult to collapse and did not disintegrate in 
landfills 
she said information on specific cost savings expected would not 
be released because the company did not want to give competitors 
any hint of the sales performance of their telephone and answering 
machine lines

japanese purchases of us real estate fell 
107 percent in 1989 with investment shifting from office 
buildings to hotels and resort properties a report monday said 
japanese spent 148 billion on us real estate last year 
compared with 165 billion in 1988 according to a study by the 
real estate accounting firm kenneth leventhal amp co 
purchases of office properties fell about 60 percent to 333 
billion in 1989 from 831 billion the previous year investment in 
hotelresort properties rose to 416 billion last year from 358 
billion in 1988 a 16 percent increase 
overall offices remain the favorite target of japanese 
investors said jack barthell a leventhal partner of the total 
577 billion that the firms computer data base shows as invested 
in us real estate 44 percent is in offices 
japanese appear to be backing away from purchases of trophy 
properties such as rockefeller center the study found 
mitsubishi estate co last year announced it was spending 846 
million for a controlling interest in the company that owns 
rockefeller center the manhattan office and cultural complex 
the study also noted that despite publicity generated by such 
purchases japanese still own just 2 percent of us commercial 
real estate far less than european investors 
california was the leading state for the second year in a row 
with 36 percent of the 1989 investment forty percent of the 
purchases were concentrated in the greater los angeles area 
hawaii was second and new york third but interest among 
japanese buyers in properties there appears to be waning 
most of the attractive properties have already been acquired 
and the cost of acquisitions in manhattan may cause investors to 
divert funds to other markets barthell said 
the top three states accounted for 81 percent of the japanese 
investment 
among other findings investment in residential property jumped 
to 15 percent triple the amount invested in 1988 nearly 
twothirds of that was in california and 28 percent in hawaii 
leventhal said the size of japanese deals is getting smaller as 
investment moves into smaller american cities and that japans 
largest institutional investors are turning attention to europe 
leading up to economic unification in 1992 
leventhal defines investment as both equity investment and 
convertible debt secured by us real estate

arizona economic council said nissan chrysler ford jaguar 
volvo and volkswagen also operate proving grounds in arizona

toyota motor sales usa inc the companys californiabased 
us marketing arm said in a news release it had filed papers with 
maricopa county to build the complex

proceed as expected said barbara demichele a spokeswoman for bj 
communications of phoenix 
the complex will include a 10mile highspeed oval where 
vehicles will reach speeds of 160 mph other shorter tracks with a 
variety of road conditions and an airstrip for flying in test cars 
and trucks she said in a prepared statement 
our requirements call for a site that offers the high 
temperature conditions well need for testing and at the same time 
provide sufficient space and even terrain to allow for course 
construction demichele said 
she said the vehicles would be primarily destined for the us 
market 
toyota chose the site near wickenburg from among 10 on a list 
developed from a national search begun in 1988 said scott eubanks 
of the economic council 
eubanks said the state offered no economic incentives 
we are especially pleased because we were able to attract 
toyota on our merits alone he said 
toyota officials declined to estimate the cost of the track or 
the land acquisition the arizona republic reported last month that 
toyota would pay 476 million for 14000 acres of land it 
attributed the report to a source close to the negotiations

united steelworkers negotiators on monday 
accused wheelingpittsburgh steel corp of using pressure tactics 
to convince workers currently engaged in collective bargaining to 
accept a substandard labor agreement 
the union also said the company which for five years has been 
under bankruptcy court protection is stalling contract talks and 
us bankruptcy court proceedings 
the companys trying to brainwash our members said andrew 
lefty palm chairman of a union committee negotiating with 
wheelingpittsburgh 
in a statement late monday wheelingpittsburgh denied the 
charges and called on the union to back up its allegations in court 
thursday the company said its pay offer of more than 5 an hour 
over three years is generous 
the offer includes a 2anhour pay raise a 3000 signing 
bonus and a 4500 settlement the company said 
at an earlier news conference at union headquarters palm said 
wheelingpittsburgh executives have said they will delay bankruptcy 
filings until the union agrees to a new contract 
they have threatened me personally and they have threatened 
people on this committee that they will not file a 
reorganization plan until they get a labor agreement palm said 
that action defies a court order he added 
union officials said the company has committed a number of 
questionable actions in connection with the negotiations including 
distributing the companys contract proposal at plants and implying 
that management might liquidate the company 
also the union said company officials have talked with union 
members oneonone and in small groups to agitate them and make 
them angry at the unions leadership 
theyre at them every day palm said 
he said the company is unwilling to give workers a fair pay 
increase claiming its financial troubles make it impossible he 
challenged that assertion by presenting figures showing that 
wheelingpittsburgh is making a larger operating profit than 
another steelmaker in bankruptcy proceedings ltv inc 
the union data show ltv will pay a 1anhour average raise 
starting next year while wheelingpittsburgh is offering an 
increase of only 25 cents an hour 
wheelingpittsburgh said it and its creditors believe recovery 
would be difficult if not impossible if the unions demands 
are met 
negotiations with wheelingpittsburgh began in october but broke 
down several weeks ago said union negotiator jim bowen several 
groups of creditors are vying for control of the company once it 
comes out of bankruptcy protection but none has emerged as a 
leader which complicates the talks he said 
its pretty hard to negotiate with a ghost bowen said 
wheelingpittsburgh employs about 5500 steelworkers at plants 
in west virginia ohio and western pennsylvania 
separately monday the steelworkers union announced that its 
international president lynn r williams has asked steel oil and 
gas giant usx corp to furnish the union with copies of any 
agreement it has reached with financier carl icahn 
icahn and usx last week announced that icahns proposal to spin 
off usxs steel division will be voted on at the companys annual 
meeting in may the company said it opposes the idea but will give 
due consideration to the outcome of the vote 
in a statement williams said the spinoff proposal raises 
many questions affecting our members employed by usx our 
collective bargaining relationship and the administration of the 
many collective bargaining agreements between usx and our union 
union spokesman dick fontana said williams made his request 
friday a day after usx and icahn announced the agreement fontana 
said no response had been received from the company

the bush administration said monday that 
theres room to talk about a farreaching budget plan by 
democrat rep dan rostenkowski that calls for higher taxes and a 
oneyear social security freeze 
however white house spokesman marlin fitzwater said the 
presidents decision to consider the radical proposal by the 
chairman of the house ways and means committee doesnt mean hes 
abandoning his oftstated opposition to new taxes or social 
security changes 
we dont want to pour too much cold water on a plan we may 
want to swim around in for a while fitzwater said 
we think he deserves a lot of credit for a courageous plan a 
courageous initiative a serious initiative white house budget 
director richard darman said on the public broadcasting systems 
macneillehrer newshour 
appearing on the same program rostenkowski acknowledged that 
his proposal contained some political minefields but added 
that his plans appeal was that it called for sacrifices from 
everyone 
i think youre going to get some positive responses from it if 
we all get in the water together he said 
senate minority leader bob dole rkan called rostenkowskis 
proposal a good step and said its acrosstheboard spending 
freeze makes a great deal of sense 
his proposal could be the wakeup call weve been waiting 
for dole said in a statement well see who answers it 
on capitol hill rostenkowski spokesman jim jaffe welcomed the 
plans unexpectedly warm and apparently orchestrated reception 
from the administration and dole 
lets do it he said 
still rostenkowksis proposal unveiled over the weekend has 
generated little support from his own party 
house speaker thomas s foley dwash called rostenkowskis 
plan a very interesting suggestion but questioned its chances 
of approval unless the white house supports it 
i dont see a way we can effectively pass tax legislation 
raising taxes without the approval of the president foley told a 
reporter that remains a problem 
rostenkowski proposed chopping the federal deficit through a 
combination of spending cuts extending the maximum income tax rate 
of 33 percent to all upperincome taxpayers instead of reducing to 
28 percent above a certain ceiling as is now the case higher taxes 
on gasoline liquor and cigarettes and a oneyear freeze in most 
federal spending programs including social security 
the goal is to reduce the annual budget deficit by 1994 it 
would do away with the grammrudman deficitreduction law and its 
graduated steps for balancing the budget 
we think theres some room to talk fitzwater said it 
weaves a new pattern that needs to be considered at least 
in the past the administration has been quick to denounce 
democratic plans that advocated either tax increases or a change in 
the social security formula rostenkowskis plan would do both 
there has been speculation about a grand compromise between the 
white house and the democraticled congress for reducing the budget 
deficit one that would embrace tax increases as well as 
constraints in the growth of social security and other socalled 
entitlement programs 
fitzwater would not characterize rostenkowskis plan in such 
terms but said 
we want to consider this plan the chairman of the ways and 
means committee is certainly a very important figure this is the 
first comprehensive and thoughtful kind of plan weve seen 
fitzwater shrugged off a suggestion that the adminstrations 
posture formulated by budget director richard darman was 
designed to put democrats on the side of raising taxes and freezing 
social security benefits while allowing president bush to take 
credit for deficit reduction 
never crossed my mind fitzwater said 
rostenkowski jaffe said is used to playing the role of the 
bad guy and that if takes that to win serious consideration of 
the plan then so be it 
on the issue of taxes fitzwater said our general attitude 
is the less taxation the better 
asked if that represented a retreat from bushs nonewtaxes 
proclamations of the past fitzwater said im not signaling any 
action on our part except to say this gives us a basis for 
discussion 
rostenkowski of illinois contends a 1991 freeze in social 
security benefits and other government programs coupled with new 
taxes on cigarettes alcohol gasoline and the wealthy could reduce 
the deficit by more than 500 billion over the next five years and 
produce a balanced budget by 1994 
the oneyear freeze on social security benefits would affect 
about 39 million americans 
rostenkowski did not specify how much he would raise gasoline 
tobacco and alcohol taxes other than to say they could provide a 
total of 100 billion in new revenues over the next five years but 
he said in a television interview sunday that he envisioned the 
federal tax on gasoline rising from the current 9 cents a gallon to 
20 cents or 25 cents 
dole speaking to the national association of federal credit 
unions said there were parts of rostenkowskis plan he disliked 
but praised the general concept and applauded the oneyearfreeze 
on programs 
its got to be everybody no exceptions no big interest 
groups get off the hook dole said i think it makes a great 
deal of sense 
in remarks on the house floor rep fortney pete stark 
dcalif a member of the ways and means panel offered support 
its a challenge to all of us in government stark said 
it asks whether were serious about getting the deficit down and 
it asks whether were ready to abandon the blue smoke and mirrors 
that have obscured the facts in this debate previously

a greyhound bus in connecticut was hit by sniper fire monday and 
the chairman of the strikecrippled bus line offered a 25000 
reward for information about a weekend shooting in florida that 
injured eight passengers 
we will not bend or move because of intimidation and 
violence greyhound chairman fred g currey insisted before 
boarding a greyhound bus from jacksonville to orlando fla then 
taking a plane to miami 
no one was injured in the connecticut shooting which occurred 
on interstate 84 shortly before 11 am as a new yorktoboston 
greyhound bus headed into hartford with 19 passengers passengers 
reported hearing a small pop that some thought was a blown tire 
police recovered a bullet from the baggage compartment on the 
drivers side and were trying to determine the caliber and type of 
gun used said state police spokesman adam berluti 
the amalgamated council of greyhound local unions disavowed 
responsibility for the florida shooting but a union spokesman in 
hartford said he believed the connecticut shooting was motivated by 
the strike against the only nationwide bus company 
i would say its probably strikerelated because i have been 
driving for 17 years and was never shot at said spokesman 
charles true however pickets in hartford denied that union 
members were responsible 
the union which represents 6300 drivers and more than 3000 
office and maintenance workers went on strike march 2 there have 
been scattered violent incidents since including a striker crushed 
to death by a bus operated by a replacement driver in redding 
calif and shots fired at buses in chicago and phoenix 
currey greyhounds chairman and chief executive officer and 
frank schmeider its president flew to jacksonville early monday 
from dallas after learning of the florida shooting 
the eight passengers were hurt when someone fired a bullet 
through the front of a greyhound bus sunday night in south 
jacksonville the passengers were injured by fiberglass and 
shrapnel 
when asked if he thought the shot had come from a striker 
currey said i pray that it is not true i hope that it is not 
true i do not want to believe that anybody involved in greyhound 
would do such as thing 
the two executives visited the three passengers still 
hospitalized monday five others were released after hospital 
treatment they also visited bus riders who were put up by the 
company in a jacksonville hotel overnight 
one hospitalized passenger michael rogers of atlanta was 
critical of the company i dont think they should run their 
lines while theyre having a situation like this going on or at 
least warn the general public that a situation like that might 
occur 
in orlando currey criticized union leaders for not speaking out 
against intimidation 
their silence is deafening he said asked why he rode the 
bus he said i took the trip because i thought it was important 
for greyhound people not to be intimidated 
an executive board member of the jacksonville union local said 
he didnt believe strikers were behind the shooting 
as far as im concerned it wasnt one of our strikers said 
bill nicholson theyve been like choirboys 
sheriffs spokesman steve weintraub said monday there have been 
no arrests in the shooting and added that the possibility that the 
shot came from a striker is one of the leads we are following 
the latest violence came as federal mediators in washington 
dc met for three hours monday for an exploratory informal 
meeting with union officials 
jim power a spokesman for the federal mediation service said 
the union agreed to the possibility of additional meetings with 
the mediation service and management to start the collective 
bargaining process again 
greyhound said executive vice president p anthony lannie 
greyhounds chief negotiator would meet wednesday with the head of 
the mediation service bernard delury 
the company said it expected delury to present his 
recommendations for ending the strike 
negotiations on a threeyear contract broke down march 1 and the 
two sides have had ony sporadic telephone contact since 
in miami currey said he was pessimistic about prospects for a 
settlement of the strike soon 
we made a very very fine offer to the greyhound amalgamated 
council they shouted it down just as those men are shouting on 
the street he said pointing to pickets outside we will not 
raise fares to meet the exorbitant demands of the drivers 
currey later walked outside the terminal embraced several 
pickets and tried to answer questions about the companys position 
there was emotional arguing but the discussion remained peaceful 
a picket who didnt give his name said currey had a lot of 
guts for speaking with the strikers 
in another development in new york city a state judge upheld a 
temporary restraining order barring greyhound from hiring nonunion 
workers to replace strikers said amalgamated union local 1202 
president harold mendlowitz 
the judge scheduled a hearing for thursday to determine whether 
to issue a permanent injunction 
new york city is a major hub of operations for greyhound 
mendlowitz said if we can stop them here it will have a 
significant impact for our strike nationwide 
greyhound spokeswoman elizabeth hale disagreed on the rulings 
effect 
it does not have a major impact nationwide hale said 
were hiring permanent replacements across the country and 
putting people back to work who return to their jobs 
greyhound which serves 9600 us communities said it has 
restored service to an additional 120 communities that lost regular 
runs when the strike began 
hale said 48454 passengers rode 1876 buses on sunday the 
number of passengers amounted to 358 percent of the same day last 
year while departures were 333 percent the average load was 258 
percent 74 percent higher than last year
