honesty is not only the best policy but 
organizers of a new citywide ethics campaign hope their efforts make 
it the only policy 
the columbus commission on ethics and values headed by the rev 
jeb stuart magruder a former watergate coconspirator on wednesday 
launched its take an honest look campaign which is aimed at 
prompting discussion and thought on the value of honesty 
how do you do it we decided we would take one issue at a 
time magruder said ethics is a minefield in our society yet 
everybody is getting into it saying we need to do something 
the privately funded 75000 campaign is aimed at residents 
government officials business people schoolchildren and religious 
and civic groups plans include public forums school projects 
promotional billboards and television spots and an honesty test to 
be distributed to all askers 
magruder now a presbyterian minister was deputy director of 
communications in richard nixons administration and deputy director 
of nixons committee to reelect the president in 1972 he spent 
seven months in prison after he admitted destroying records and 
committing perjury in the watergate scandal he now serves at first 
community church in suburban marble cliff 
he said his past was the perfect recommendation for his role with 
the commission which was formed in early 1988 and he says he sees 
nothing funny in jokes circulating about his participation in the 
ethics campaign 
ive dismissed it there are cynics always he said in a 
sense im uniquely qualified to deal with the issues weve talked 
about 
magruder was appointed to the commission by mayor dana rinehart 
who has been embroiled in an investigation into allegations that he 
sexually assaulted a baby sitter while he was franklin county 
treasurer in 1978 
rineharts case went to a grand jury but he was never charged 
however the investigation was renewed last year when news reports 
questioned how the initial investigation was handled 
the mayor who attended the news conference said he has heard 
cynical comments from some members of the news media and politicians 
about his involvement with the panel 
i dont care what people say take my personal situation i 
take the attitude of my 15yearold daughter they have a problem i 
dont have a problem rinehart said 
the honesty campaigns chairman william bennett president of 
bank one said it wont draw conclusions point fingers or make 
judgments but was intended to raise consciousness about honesty 
the ethics commission was spawned months after the rear door of 
an armored car flew open spilling bags of cash onto a freeway many 
motorists who stopped to scoop up the flying cash never returned it 
although one man became a local celebrity when he returned 57000 
since then other stories touting honesty have surfaced two 
hotel maids cathy dean and paula vaughan received plaques of 
appreciation from magruder and rinehart on wednesday for returning 
65000 they found in a shoebox while cleaning a local motel suite 
the campaign to raise consciousness about honesty does not target 
prison inmates 
asked why magruder laughed and looked suprised 
i hadnt even thought of it to be honest with you thats a 
good idea though he said

federal programs to curb illegally high amounts 
of pesticides and other chemicals in the nations meat supply have 
been slipshod and sometimes allowed adulterated food to reach store 
shelves according to an internal audit 
the report by the agriculture departments inspector generals 
office said the departments inspection agency the food safety and 
inspection service or fsis has little authority to prevent 
pesticide residues from showing up in meat and poultry 
accordingly fsis has turned to the food industry itself for 
cooperation in monitoring levels of chemicals and ferreting out 
violations 
but agriculture department investigators found that in some cases 
meat and poultry containing too much of these chemical residues were 
allowed into the consumer pipeline 
even when animals were presented to inspectors agency 
administrative controls and current policies did not ensure timely 
and effective response when pesticide residue was suspected or found 
in meat and poultry products the report said as a result some 
adulterated products were allowed to enter commerce 
the chief responsibility of fsis is to ensure that usdainspected 
meat and poultry products are safe wholesome and free of 
adulterating chemicals as part of its responsibility the agency 
samples and analyzes edible tissues to see if they meet the federal 
standards 
but the system is far from foolproof and the agency also 
includes efforts to enlighten farmers and processors about the 
federal standards and how to comply with them 
the report which was completed last november but not given wide 
distribution by the department said fsis was unable to 
successfully investigate pesticide violations in 79 percent of the 
cases reviewed by the auditors a violation was defined as an 
illegal level of chemical residue found in a sample of meat or 
poultry 
some of the reasons for the lack of success in investigating 
violations included 
tracing the illegal residue to the original producer was not 
always successful 
followup samples from suspected meat were seldom taken or else 
the suspected animals or carcasses were not always retained for 
further checking 
documentation of regulatory actions was insufficient 
starting in june 1986 when a company signed a memorandum of 
understanding with fsis it agreed to upgrade its own quality 
control procedures was exempted from routine monitoring by the 
agency and placed under a lessintensive monitoring program 
in addition these companies became eligible to make certain 
claims on their product labels concerning chemical residue levels 
or superior quality control procedures the report said 
by 1988 this verified production control program included 11 
companies and 34 slaughter plants out of a us total of 1800 
plants the participating plants had an annual slaughter of about 5 
billion pounds or about 8 percent of all animals slaughtered last 
year 
in all the agency is responsible for inspection in more than 
7000 meat and poultry slaughter and processing plants 
the usda investigators visited 96 federally inspected meat and 
poultry plants and conducted research at the agencys national 
office three regional offices three field laboratories and five 
usdaaccredited laboratories 
one of the major problems uncovered was in identification of the 
original farmer feedlot operator or other livestock producer that 
have been found to be in violation of the federal residue levels 
investigators found that fsis was unable to locate producers in 
12 of 28 pesticide violation cases reviewed 
in one case regional office personnel did not act on all the 
information that was available not even when tags on a 6yearold 
cow provided information on the name of the livestock auction market 
where the cow was sold 
the agency contacted the auction market and was told cows 
previous owner was unknown so the case was closed the report said 
federal regulations administered by another usda agency the animal 
and plant health inspection service require such cows to be 
identified and records maintained 
but fsis made no attempt to contact the other agency and the 
regional official in charge of residues said that staff people 
didnt take time to check further 
the report recommended that the agency seek legislation for 
mandatory identification of the source of all animal species 
slaughtered for domestic food consumption however fsis responded 
that such a move should be directed to policymakers not the 
regulatory agency itself 
lester m crawford fsis administrator said that historically 
the agency has pursued animal identification as a related part of 
the residue testing program 
we recently were successful in obtaining a swine identification 
program outside of the legislative route and would strongly support 
similar identification for the other species which come under our 
jurisdiction crawford said in a response to the report

elizabeth hanford liddy dole presidentelect bushs choice 
to head the labor department is half of one of washingtons most 
powerful couples a harvardtrained lawyer whose charm has won her 
bipartisan popularity in the nations capital 
mrs dole 52 was a democrat when she came to washington two 
decades ago but switched to an independent and then republican as 
she climbed the ladder of success holding several jobs in the nixon 
and ford administrations and becoming an active campaigner in the 
presidential campaigns of her husband senate republican leader bob 
dole of kansas 
president reagan chose her as transportation secretary in 1983 
she served for four years and left with her popularity intact 
despite criticism that during her tenure air and highway safety 
suffered 
organized labor had a few disputes with mrs dole while she was 
at transportation but labor leaders have voiced approval of her 
selection if only for the fact that they believe her political 
ambitions will lead her to seek a higher profile than those who were 
passed over for the job 
at the labor department she will be involved in bushs promised 
plan to expand day care availability and likely will serve as the 
administrations chief spokeswoman when congress debates raising the 
minumum wage and in a legal fight over the governments plan to drop

during his 11 years in washington william h webster has been 
called upon to cleanse the reputations of two tarnished but vital 
federal agencies first the fbi and since 1987 the cia 
after bush won the election last november critics of webster 
pressed for his ouster as director of central intelligence 
but bush who was cast out as cia director by newly elected 
president carter in 1977 announced on dec 7 that he had total 
confidence in webster and that his tenure at the spy agency was 
openended 
webster 64 was appointed cia director in the wake of 
revelations that the late william casey had subverted agency 
operations to run his own offtheshelf intelligence network 
consisting in large part of cia operatives but working outside the 
oversight of congress 
webster who was born in st louis and trained as an attorney 
still prefers the title judge which he earned on the eight 
circuit court of appeals 
he was summoned to washington in 1978 by president carter to take 
over the fbi at the time the fbi was still tainted from the 
48year directorship of j edgar hoover who threatened politicians 
with secret files and ordered domestic spying against those with 
whom he disagreed 
when webster left the agency nine years later he had largely 
restored the image of the bureau and moved it into new areas of 
investigation such as white collar crime and drug trafficking

talks with moscow

something there is about an actor who loves 
the act of giving so it was nice to find a bunch of santa 
clauses running around the set of the new james bond movie 
license revoked 
timothy dalton has been very giving as an actor said robert 
davi forgetting for the moment that his villainous character spends 
the last part of the movie trying to grind daltonbond into cocaine 
dust 
i dont think you can create anything if you dont give 
returned dalton who manages to give davis character a hole in the 
head 
hes very professional very focused said carey lowell of 
dalton shortly after saving bond from a fate worse than coke 
its better than working with somebody who doesnt give a damn 
seriously now 
i would loathe a concept of work in which people are competing 
with each other said dalton i think it is a twoway process 
it is a game where you throw something at somebody and they throw it 
back at you 
in other words these actors say this is how they work they 
have nothing to give but themselves and that can be scary but if 
an actor holds back if nothing is given nothing can be thrown back 
its probably true that some actors see it as a competition 
but it seems very ungenerous to attempt to deny to another actor the 
tools with which to work dalton said i think if you look at 
any really good actors youll find them all very giving 
lowell whose face has decorated the covers of vogue and 
mademoiselle understands that concept as one of the differences 
between modeling and acting 
its different from modeling because you dont have to give to 
the camera you give to the actors instead she said and if you 
give only to the camera in a film if youre static it shows 
immediately its difficult 
to hear these people talk youd think making moving pictures was 
fun not long hours of work intense concentration weird 
situations just what does an actor think about while hogtied on a 
conveyor belt waiting to be ground almost to magnesium dust 
thats what they use as a standin for cocaine 
when youre in the thick of it you have to think of what to do 
in the scene youve got to be on form and on key and 
concentrated said dalton 
the effort to maintain concentration is why he has a reputation 
for being difficult for outsiders to talk to on the set 
if you cant get it right you dont get a moment to do it 
again he said you just dont get a moment to do it again 
now lets back up the film is license revoked and it is due 
for release in the summer james bond loses his license to kill and 
goes off the reservation to avenge his friend cia agent felix 
leiter who gave his leg to some sharks with the help of 
franz sanchez davi an evil drug lord modeled a little bit on 
gen manuel antonio noriega de facto ruler of panama who has been 
indicted on drug trafficking charges in the united states he is 
foiled with the help of 
pam bouvier lowell a former pilot for the cia who worked with 
leiter and who saves bond and helps giftwrap sanchez at mexico 
citys churusbusco studios under the direction of john glen 
dalton 42 is a classically trained actor who has established 
his ability to play all kinds of roles everything from 
shakespeares richard ii to the male lead opposite mae west in 
sextette 
that range is the envy of lowell and davi who would like to have 
the opportunity to show that they too can change their spots 
unfortunately i always have to play a beautiful girl now i 
want to do something less stylish the 27yearold lowell said 
davi 35 would like to go up the style scale not down and to 
that end hes trying to push the envelope on the bond villain bit 
this guy could be a friend who you think itd be nice to have a 
drink with but after the last sip he stabs you it kind of makes 
him fun to play said davi 
i want to make my mark in film he said i want to be an 
international star i want to get the girl without putting a gun to 
her head im looking for mister goodguy 
dalton thinks theyve both got a chance 
everyone has to be good because you want a good movie it 
would be stupid and destructive not to be a creative giving actor 
its how we work together

if robert davi ever gets tired of being a 
villain on film he can always try opera thats how he got his 
start in show biz and when he talks about a character it can sound 
a bit well operatic 
i was a high baritone loved verdi said davi who plays drug 
lord franz sanchez in license revoked the latest james bond 
movie due out in the summer i sang for the lyric opera of long 
island 
davi 35 did that when he was 19 he even studied with tito 
gobbi one of the great voices of italy 
if i was still singing i wouldnt be doing any of this now 
he said waving at a bond set gloomy with smoke from the fire that 
destroys the villains laboratory 
i wouldnt be smoking cigars or drinking and id get out of 
this air mexico citys worldrecord pollution i wouldnt even be 
talking i would be totally crazy 
after im established as an actor id like to spend six months 
and work on the voice now the voice is getting the black mark 
timothy dalton who plays bond had proposed that davi play 
sanchez as an opera buff i suggested to him that he had to find a 
moment where he sang a bar or two probably at an odd moment right 
after or just before he killed somebody whistle or sing a couple of 
bars 
we thought about it when we first met davi said timothy 
wanted me to try something but i decided i better not i did the 
same thing in goonies sort of played a frustrated opera singer i 
didnt want to do the same thing as i did in the spielberg film 
which was full of pirate ships and fantasies i want to be 
remembered for something else in this film 
but dalton said he didnt see why davi should worry about that 
if its a good idea 
all actors have good ideas but theyre not always germane to 
the piece said davi more diplomatic than sparafucile the hired 
killer of verdis rigoletto 
but sanchez seductive charming and totally immoral as 
davi conceived him might be able to hold his own with many another 
opera bad guy 
the most difficult was when i walked through that house in 
acapulco that was supposed to be the house i owned a 30 million 
house i dont have 30 million davi said 
you know a lot of actors when they play something like that 
you see them in the house but you dont really believe that they own 
it i had to go through that house and feel like i owned it 
then he bursts into a snatch of va tosca a solo in which 
the evil scarpia boasts that hes infected toscas heart with 
jealousy by fooling her into thinking her boyfriend is fooling 
around 
watch out puccini

kangaroos may soon end up on dinner 
plates in new south wales australias most populous state animal 
welfare groups are hopping mad 
they contend few australians will want to feast on their national 
symbol but that tourists might 
conservationists called the decision disastrous and 
potentially dangerous because kangaroos carry a host of diseases 
paul hogan the comic star of crocodile dundee is luring 
american tourists to sydney but all they are likely to see is a 
bloodbath said sue arnold of australians for animals the 
countrys largest wildlife conservation group 
kangaroos are shot by helicopter poisoned snared and used for 
pet food as well as an export industry now theyre being offered 
for domestic human consumption how can they survive she said in 
an interview 
hogan hailed by the tourist industry for his throw another 
shrimp on the barbie commercials that brought a record 2 million 
visitors to australias bicentennial celebrations in 1988 has a new 
series to be screened in the united states in february 
in the commercial as reported by the sydney morning herald 
hogan says that god had a sense of humor when he desposited in 
australia the famous giant hopping mouse the kangaroo 
tourism minister graham richardson said the commercials are 
expected to contribute to a 20 percent growth in tourism this year 
five million tourists are expected by the year 2000 said bill gray 
manager of the governmentfunded tourism australia 
officials said a decision jan 6 to harvest kangaroos for human 
consumption will not endanger wildlife 
the news south wales health minister peter collins said the 
program is for farming kangaroos not depleting wildlife stocks the 
decision reverses a longstanding ban in new south wales of which 
sydney is the tourist gateway 
kangaroo meat already is consumed in the states of south 
australia and western australia its is described extremely lean 
full of protein and somewhat gamy not unlike venison 
collins said his department would ensure that kangaroo meat is 
safe to eat but arnold and others questioned how the state 
government planned to farm the creatures and maintain a standard 
that makes them fit for consumption 
australias population is 165 million the governments national 
parks amp wildlife service estimates the kangaroo population at about 
15 million an annual culling quota is about 3 million with the 
meat used for pet food and skins turned into such goods as wallets 
and purses for export 
what other country in the world slaughters its national 
symbol said richard jones a member of the new south wales 
parliament who was elected in 1987 on a platform of animal welfare 
arnold said kangaroos carry a range of diseases such as 
salmonella tuberculosis toxoplasmosis and hydatid cysts a worm 
that can be fatal 
farmers regard the kangaroo as a pest the greenpeace and animal 
liberation organizations both supporters of australians for 
animals said the decision represents a victory for the farm lobby 
the canberra times a newspaper in australias capital said the 
kangaroo industry is in chaos 
it said there is compelling evidence of widespread illegal 
shooting and few controls on the transportation of skins and 
carcasses interstate 
only licensed professional shooters are supposed to hunt 
kangaroos but conservationists and others maintain the government 
regulation is loosely enforced 
at the end of the day the only conclusion to be drawn is that 
the government controls on the kangaroo industry are worthless 
the newspaper said in an editorial 
christine townsend spokeswoman for animal liberation called the 
decision a disaster 
it simply commercializes our wildlife she said

a scare in britain over food poisoning from eggs 
has led agriculture minister john macgregor to announce new controls 
for the poultry industry that he said will be the worlds strictest 
inspections of stockfeed plants will be doubled and plants with 
contaminated premises will not be allowed to ship their feed he 
said wednesday in a house of commons written reply 
macgregor promised new laws to give greater control over imported 
feed and british hatcheries and breeding flocks producers will have 
to register and submit their flocks products and premises to 
regular bacteriological checks 
macgregor also announced a national campaign to educate the 
public in food hygiene in the home to reduce the incidence of food 
poisoning generally 
after reports that eggs had caused food poisoning with 
slaughterhouse waste used in stockfeed a possible suspect junior 
health minister edwina currie said most egg production was infected 
by salmonella bacteria 
eggs sales slumped farmers began killing chickens and mrs 
currie quit under fire on dec 16 
the government promised farmers 34 million compensation and 
launched a national advertising campaign to restore public 
confidence in eating eggs 
the governments chief medical officer sir donald acheson said 
last week that salmonella in eggs is still a serious health problem

airplanes can trigger lightning bolts when 
lightning is not occurring naturally suggesting that airplanes have 
a greater chance of being struck by lightning than previously 
believed new studies show 
the studies also show that many lightning rods and protective 
devices are inadequate to handle the rapid surge of electrical 
current when a lightning bolt strikes said e philip krider of the 
university of arizona in tucson 
you need to have a protective system that is much faster than 
we thought even 10 years ago krider said wednesday at the annual 
meeting of the american association for the advancement of science 
krider and his colleagues have for the first time been able to 
trigger direct and study lightning bolts in electrified clouds 
those studies have shown that current in a lightning bolt can 
surge 400000 amps in a millionth of a second about 20 times faster 
than researchers had thought possible krider said 
most distribution arrestors the kind you put on power lines 
are probably not fast enough to protect the lines from lightning 
damage he said 
many lightning rods likewise cannot carry current to the ground 
quickly enough so there is a danger that the current will spark 
wildly in dfferent directions from the tip of the lightning rod 
krider and his colleagues trigger lightning bolts by launching 
into electrified clouds a threefootlong rocket trailing a wire 
connected to the ground 
the rocket disturbs the electrical charges in the cloud begins 
to spark at its tip and then triggers a lightning bolt down the wire 
to the ground 
the researchers have learned that about threequarters of the 
spacecraft that have been hit by lightning have triggered the 
lightning bolts themselves by a similar process 
a large fraction of thick layered clouds are electrified and 
could provide the right environment for commercial aircraft and even 
small private planes to trigger lightning bolts krider said 
the triggered lightning hazard was previously unsuspected 
because the cloud was not making any lightning he said 
researchers do not yet know how to identify clouds that provide 
the environment for this triggered lightning krider said 
if we understood what kinds of clouds have this potential we 
might be able to say avoid this situation he said 
lightning can pose a serious hazard to aircraft by disturbing 
their electrical systems or blowing out their engines krider said 
krider is part of a team of scientists studying how to reduce the 
chances that lightning bolts will strike and damage the space 
shuttle 
they are trying to devise a way to monitor the electrification of 
the clouds so launches can be postponed when conditions are ripe for 
the shuttle to trigger lightning bolts 
the researchers also are trying to devise ways to make the 
shuttle more resistant to lightning damage if it is struck he said 
one of the problems underlying the research he said is that 
physicists dont understand how electricity builds up in clouds

who walk on the wild side 
but the citys public safety chief glenn cannon isnt certain

is almost like a birthright to many pedestrians 
i dont think were going to start locking people up for 
jaywalking said cannon who admitted wednesday he has ignored a 
crosswalk or two 
our efforts are aimed at education not enforcement 
cannon said he has ordered officers to issue warnings to 
jaywalkers as part of a program to educate pedestrians that the 
practice can be dangerous 
motorists who block intersections at traffic lights will be 
issued written warnings and the program will include tighter 
enforcement of illegal parking violations

two businessmen were arrested 
wednesday and charged with conspiring to sell spare parts for the 
f14 tomcat fighter jet to iran the us customs service said 
george demar 58 an independent pilot from east quogue and paul 
amara of north babylon an aircraft parts broker were accused of 
negotiating with an undercover customs agent posing as a 
representative of iran interested in buying spare parts for the 
fighter said gary hillberry special agentincharge of customs 
new york office 
in exchange for 1 million the men allegedly agreed to provide 
the parts a plane and pilot and pay the cost of shipping the parts 
hillberry said the undercover agent suggested shipping the parts 
through shannon ireland to cover their trail 
the men were arrested after the agent met with them wednesday 
morning at suffolk county airport in westhampton beach and verified 
that the parts were on the plane 
the plan was to take off today after we gave them a certain 
amount of goodfaith money hillberry said 
hillberry said the agent approached the men after the customs 
service learned that they wanted to sell the parts hillberry said 
they were interested in brokering the parts we told them we 
were iranian representatives and they picked the ball up from 
there hillberry said 
the parts were originally purchased as surplus from the 
manufacturer by a middleman who in turn sold them to the men 
arrested wednesday hillberry said 
the middleman was not involved in the scheme to sell the parts to 
iran hillberry said 
export of spare parts for the f14 to iran is illegal without a 
license from the state department according to the customs service 
moreover hillberry said it is not possible to obtain such a 
license because were not dealing with iran 
a complete inventory of the parts or the quantity involved was 
not immediately available hillberry said the parts on the plane 
included equipment for loading ammunition in the jets 20mm canon 
and hydraulic assemblies for the jets landing gear 
demar and paul amara were arrested at the airport us attorney 
charles rose said they were arraigned in federal court in brooklyn 
on charges of conspiracy and violating the arms export control act 
if convicted they face fines of up to 250000 and a maximum of 
15 years in prison 
federal magistrate carol amon released demar on 1 million 
personal recognizance bond amara was released on 250000 bond 
customs agents seized the twinengine turboprop on which the 
parts were loaded hillberry said the germanmade hansa plane was 
capable of making the flight to europe he would not identify the 
planes owner who he said was unaware of the scheme when he leased 
the jet

jimmy carter and jerry ford say they dont know 
why they got such bad press while in office and president reagan has 
played so well in the media 
presidents nixon johnson ford and i had bad relations with 
the press reagan had good relations said carter why i dont 
know 
the two former presidents took part in a discussion at columbia 
university on wednesday on the press the presidency and the first 
hundred days 
carter said he spent weeks trying to deflect attention from a 
story that a killer rabbit had swum out to his boat as he was 
fishing and that he had to beat it back with oars 
how can you control something like that carter asked the 
rabbit story he said gave an image of an incompetent president 
who could not even protect himself against a rabbit 
he said ford was the best athlete ever in the white house but 
he was dogged by stories about his supposed clumsiness it hurt 
him politically carter said 
ford said news people who accompanied him on ski trips to vail 
fell as much on the slopes as he did but nobody took pictures of 
them 
the images are hurtful he said but its part of what they 
think the public wants 
ford and carter agreed that when it comes to relations with the 
news media george bush will find ronald reagan a hard act to follow 
reagan was treated with kid gloves by the press ford said and 
carter thinks reagan got away with staying aloof from tough issues

garlic and onions can put a crimp in your 
social life but they also could provide unexpected protection 
against cancer according to a study published by the national 
cancer institute 
the study compared foods eaten by stomach cancer victims with the 
diet of healthy people in linqu china researchers found that the 
strongsmelling vegetables can significantly reduce the risk of 
stomach cancer 
published this week in the journal of the national cancer 
institute the study says researchers used questionnaires to compare 
the dietary habits of 685 patients with stomach cancer with those of 
1131 other people matched by age gender occupation and 
education who had no diagnosed cancer 
people in the control or cancerfree group each year consumed 
at least 25 andsometimes more than 50 pounds of allium vegetables a 
genus which includes onions garlic leeks chives ramps and 
scallions 
the cancer patients generally ate less than 25 pounds of the 
vegetables 
the study also found that the risk of stomach cancer declined as 
the habitual consumption of such vegetables increased in other 
words the more onions and garlic you eat over a lifetime the less 
your chances of stomach cancer 
persons in linqu tended to be exposed to mild doses of allium 
vegetables over long periods likely beginning in childhood the 
study said our study suggests that all or part of such exposure 
has resulted in a reduction in stomach cancer risk starting at an 
early age and continuing throughout life 
the anticancer effects of onionlike root vegetables have been 
suggested in studies dating back to the 1950s a 1979 study for 
instance found a reduced amount of stomach cancer among residents 
of a georgia county famous for growing vidalia onions a study in 
greece showed that gastric cancer patients usually ate fewer fresh 
vegetables including onions than those who were cancerfree 
several experimental studies have suggested that compounds in 
allium vegetables can protect against cancer in laboratory 
animals the nci journal study said it said a variety of studies 
have shown that chemical compounds extracted from onions and garlic 
tend to reduce alter or prevent cancer in laboratory rats mice and 
hamsters 
but the study said the precise anticancer element in allium 
vegetables has not been pinpointed 
the chinese study found that reduced risks were associated not 
only with intake of all allium vegetables combined but also with 
individual allium foods suggesting that these vegetables have a 
common chemical component possibly allyl sulfides that is 
protective in humans 
researchers also suggested that since garlic has been shown to 
have antibacterial properties it could help prevent stomach cancer 
by blocking the conversion of nitrates to nitrites a compound 
associated with developing stomach cancer 
the statistical study was conducted by a national cancer 
institute team led by wj blot and by researchers from the 
peoples republic of china 
interviews for the study were conducted between 1984 and 1986 in 
linqu county part of the shantung province in northeast china this 
area has one of the highest stomach cancer mortality rates in china

republicans attack on the states muchcriticized furlough program

donald trumps quest to acquire eastern 
airlines northeastern shuttle for 365 million cleared a key 
regulatory hurdle as the us department of transportation gave 
tentative approval to his operating plans 
the transportation department on wednesday said it has concluded 
that trumps proposed plans are financially sound and his key 
personnel possess the managerial and technical ability to carry them 
out 
essentially weve tentatively approved a fitness certification 
for trump to operate the trump shuttle said hal paris a 
transportation department spokesman we are allowing any 
interested parties who have objections to file them within the next 
15 days then theres a sevenday period to respond to any of those 
objections 
the federal aviation administration still must certify that the 
planned shuttle operation is safe before the deal is final 
texas air corp easterns houstonbased holding company has 
been trying to sell the profitable shuttle arguing that it needs 
cash to survive 
a federal judge approved the sale last month over objections of 
labor leaders who had challenged it as a unionbusting tactic the 
carriers unions argue that the shuttle sale is part of a plan by 
texas air to dismantle eastern airlines whose 30000 employees are 
represented by three militant unions 
there is no doubt that an ongoing struggle has and will 
continue to exist between eastern and its unions us district 
judge barrington d parker wrote in his opinion however the 
court feels that equally plausible is the idea that management is 
seeking to rebuild the company and place it on a sound financial 
footing 
the unions said they would appeal the decision 
the shuttle makes hourly flights among boston new york and 
washington trump announced an agreement to purchase it on oct 12 
1988 
he plans to rename the service the trump shuttle 
trump already owns casinos in atlantic city nj and a 
helicopter service that flies between the gambling mecca and new 
york city

americans shook their heads and wondered what he meant but 
fireworks designers had a different reaction 
we said to ourselves that sounds like a great fireworks 
show said philip butler of fireworks by grucci 
the gruccis veterans of two previous inaugurations got their 
chance to display an exclusive designer shell in a barrage to 
highlight this theme at the inaugural opening wednesday evening at

points of light repeatedly exploded in the sky pearllike flashes 
lasting 30 seconds each against the darkening sky said butler with 
satisfaction most shells last no more than four seconds

a leconte moores role at the presidential 
inauguration wont be apparent unless terrorists attack the parade 
floats collapse thieves steal the 10000gallon cowboy hat or wind 
tears the 20 by 40foot flag off its staff 
as insurance man for the presidential inaugural committee moore 
hopes none of these remote possibilities will ruin the event 
protected with special policies arranged by his company new 
yorkbased brokerage marsh amp mclennan cos inc 
i dont want claims i dont want people to get hurt moore 
said in an interview i dont want pic to be sued i dont want 
the insurance companies to have to pay the claims 
although the insurance companies cant blame him if there are 
claims moore said he wants to stay on their good side 
you can always find another client you cant always find 
another insurance company said moore vice president of the 
companys entertainment amp leisure division 
moore is securing policies from approximately 25 other insurers 
including the gulf united corp the chubb group and the american 
international group the complete insurance package is said to be 
costing the committee between 300000 and 400000 
moore declined to specify the price tag but described it as an 
incredibly costeffective deal considering the terrorism right 
now 
general liability insurance moores biggest concern would cover 
personal injury in the event of a terrorist attack liability covers 
other contingencies as well ranging from collapsed spectator 
bleachers to food poisoning at a postinauguration cocktail 
reception 
moore declined to specify how much coverage is provided saying 
disclosure could invite frivolous lawsuits 
you can get lawyers hovering like wolves around a carcass he 
said 
what happens if bush is injured i doubt the president would 
sue his own committee moore said 
if inaugural history is any indication things can go wrong 
longtime washington residents still recall when army troops had 
to shovel pennsylvania avenue after a snowstorm struck on the eve of 
john f kennedys inauguration in 1961 
frigid temperatures in 1985 drove president reagans inauguration 
indoors and canceled the parade down pennsylvania avenue 
that decision may have prevented lawsuits over frostbite but the 
inaugural committee had to offer to return more than 840000 to 
17500 parade ticketholders the event was then insured for 
liability and property but not cancellation moore has changed that 
now 
the pic wants to be able to say its too cold out we cannot 
let the parade go on he said 
aside from a few fenderbenders from paraderelated accidents no 
claims were filed in 1985 
the inaugural gala is expected to gross about 9 million from 
television advertising and ticket sales the committee will use the 
proceeds to help defray inaugural expenses including the insurance 
aside from terrorism and accidents the committee also is insured 
in case the broadcast goes awry either because of technical 
problems or because somebody says something on the air that invites 
a lawsuit 
if someones libeled or slandered during the broadcast or in 
the audience and this is a roast pic wants to know how they can 
avoid losses moore said

punishment for federal criminals will be 
fairer and more certain because of the supreme courts decision 
upholding the constitutionality of uniform sentencing attorney 
general dick thornburgh says 
the probability of a safer future for all americans is 
increased because of the courts decision thornburgh said after 
the court voted 81 wednesday that the us sentencing commission 
rules or guidelines are constitutional 
lawmakers and judges joined in praising the decision which means 
many federal criminals will have to be resentenced because trial 
judges had refused on constitutional grounds to follow the 
guidelines after they took effect in november 1987 
sentences will stand for those federal criminals who went before 
judges adhering to the guidelines people sentenced under the 
guidelines usually spend more time behind bars 
by eliminating widespread disparity in sentencing practices 
the guidelines make the punishment for crime not only fairer but 
also more certain thornburgh said 
sen edward m kennedy dmass said the decision clears the 
way for longoverdue reform of the current chaotic and unfair 
federal sentencing procedures 
kennedy a senior member of the senate judiciary committee 
added congress stands ready to cooperate with the commission the 
justice department and the courts to make the new guidelines work 
it is time to end the gross disparities in sentencing that permit 
too many convicted offenders to avoid any real punishment 
commission chairman william w wilkins jr a judge on the 4th 
us circuit court of appeals in richmond va said wednesdays 
ruling makes the disputed guidelines the law of the land and the 
barriers to full implementation have been lifted 
the decision has no effect on defendants convicted and sentenced 
in state courts 
although more than 150 judges struck down the guidelines a 
greater number of judges had chosen to implement them 
the commission was created in the sentencing reform act of 1984 
legislation aimed at eliminating what some called unjustified 
disparities in sentencing 
the law enpowers the commission whose members are appointed by 
the president to sixyear terms to tell federal judges what 
sentences should be imposed for certain crimes 
the judges must follow the commmissions guidelines which 
generally stiffened the prison time federal convicts are required to 
serve 
the commission eliminated parole and curtailed credit for good 
behavior 
in other matters wednesday the court 
unanimously struck down a west virginia countys practice of 
taxing some property at up to 35 times as much as neighboring 
comparable land 
the justices however said their ruling does not affect the 
ironically named welcome stranger property tax systems under 
which many states impose dramatically higher taxes for newly 
purchased property 
ruled 80 in a california case that labor unions may not fire 
elected local union officials for disagreeing with the parent 
unions policies 
heard arguments in an important civil rights case from alaska 
washington state and oregon over the role of statistics in proving 
that an employers subjective decisions are illegally discriminatory

the transportation department is putting a 
60day hold on its plan to cut back subsidies that allow airlines to 
operate unprofitable routes in rural areas saying it took the 
action to give congress time to look for more money 
department officials cited a 66 million budget shortfall last 
month in proposing to sharply curtail the essential air service 
program under the program the federal government subsidizes 
flights to and from 155 small cities that would probably not 
otherwise have air service because the routes are not moneymakers 
dot originally said it hoped the cuts could take effect on march 
1 following a public comment period but the plan was swiftly 
attacked by lawmakers and the department said wednesday it yielded 
in response to requests from members of congress 
because the shortage is only 66 million i thought there was 
a very good chance that congress would restore the money to avoid 
the loss of airline service rep bob davis rmich said 
wednesday the major problem was the timing 
now that the program has been given a 60day reprieve sen 
robert byrd dwva said i believe that additional funds can be 
found within the budget and it would be premature for the 
transportation department to disrupt essential air service without 
exploring the opportunities for supplemental funds 
despite the postponement of the cuts sen jay rockefeller 
dwva said he still planned to introduce a resolution asking the 
department to keep the subsidies intact until congress can come up 
with the 66 million 
he and byrd said the subsidies were critical to west virginias 
economic growth 
but dot warned that action must come soon because the longer the 
program proceeds at current financing levels the harder it will be 
to achieve savings later 
if the funding issue is not resolved by early june a notice to 
all subsidized essential air service carriers will be necessary 
indicating that no funds will be available beyond midjuly the 
department said 
the department had earlier proposed four likely plans for coping 
with the cuts one of them considered the harshest by some would 
cut 53 cities out of the program onethird of those cities are more 
than 100 miles from the next nearest airport 
states that would have been hit particularly hard by the cutbacks 
included arizona arkansas california indiana kansas michigan 
minnesota montana nebraska new york north dakota oklahoma 
south dakota texas and west virginia

kuwait will remove six of its oil tankers from 
the us registration that gave them a military umbrella during the 
iraniraq war but five others will still fly the american flag and 
have allamerican crews by early next year administration officials 
say 
the decision to cut back reflects a desire by the kuwaitis to 
save on the cost of maintaining allamerican crews as the ships 
must have combined with a wish by the united states and kuwait to 
maintain stability in the region despite eased tensions 
the kuwaitis had received a waiver of the crew requirement when 
they first decided in 1987 to reflag tankers to obtain american 
military protection inside the persian gulf the waiver allows the 
kuwaitis to sail the vessels with only two americans on board the 
ships master and the ships radio officer 
those five ships are going to remain under the us flag 
indefinitely and will have to be fully manned by us crews 
providing approximately 250 additional jobs for american seamen 
one defense source said wednesday 
the sources said that in order to provide the kuwaitis a year to 
come into compliance with shipmanning laws the defense department 
requested and the coast guard approved on tuesday a special 
national defense waiver good through feb 11 1990 
the officials insisted wednesday the issue of how many kuwaiti 
ships would remain under the us flag had turned solely on the 
question of compliance with the manning laws 
we told them we had protected their ships we werent leaving 
the gulf wed like to see the ships stay under our flag but we 
expected them to comply with the manning law said one 
administration official 
they countered they were willing to keep the ships under the 
us flag but didnt want to put allamerican crews on all of them 
the sources insisted they knew of no deeper motive for the 
kuwaitis decision beyond that of paying the higher salaries 
expected by american crews 
theres no deep meaning here from a political standpoint 
said one official its quite obvious that nothing is happening in 
the persian gulf now with the iraniraq truce so they dont need 
any us protection 
but they are sensitive to perceptions on capitol hill said 
another source they dont want to turn their back on us after all 
of our help and then see the truce break down and the tanker war 
erupt again 
and from our standpoint this promotes stability in the area 
and our relationship with kuwait said another official 
the reagan administration agreed to allow kuwait to reregister 
the 11 tankers under the us flag in order to extend them 
protection against iranian attack kuwait is a key ally of iraq and 
as a result had seen its tankers increasingly come under iranian 
attack 
the five ships that will remain under the us flag include four 
oil product carriers the surf city chesapeake city sea isle city 
and ocean city and the supertanker bridgeton

a classaction lawsuit accusing the us 
customs service of discriminating against its 1800 hispanic 
employees is taking some of its cues from a recently successful 
action against the fbi 
the classaction suit wednesday by the mexican american legal 
defense and educational fund alleges that the customs service under 
commissioner william von raab has removed almost all hispanics from 
key management posts and barred others from entering the executive 
ranks 
maldef says the customs service is employing an informal and 
unfairly discriminatory promotion system to circumvent the formal 
merit promotion system at the expense of the hispanics employed at 
the agency 
a federal judge in september ruled in favor of hispanic fbi 
agents who alleged that the bureau promoted hispanic agents too 
slowly assigned them lessdesirable jobs and gave them little 
recognition for their successes damages have yet to be determined 
in the fbi case 
we did take our lessons from the fbi suit maldef associate 
counsel mario moreno said in an interview 
customs service spokesman david hoover said wednesday the agency 
would have no comment while the lawsuit is in court 
the suit names treasury secretary nicholas brady von raab and 25 
other customs service and treasury department officials 
it alleges employment discrimination against hispanic customs 
service employees in violation of title vii of the civil rights act 
of 1964 
hispanic employees represent over 11 percent of the agencys work 
force of some 15600 people yet there are no hispanics in the 
senior management ranks said maldefs suit 
it alleges that since 1980 the commissioner of customs has 
actively sought to reduce the number of hispanic employees at upper 
management levels 
nine years ago customs employed nine hispanics in top 
supervisory posts but now the agency employs just three or 15 
percent of the people at that level the suit said there are no 
hispanics in the senior executive service which includes regional 
commissioners assistant commissioners and other executive level 
posts the suit said 
eightythree percent of hispanics at the customs service are 
concentrated in three regions the southwest pacific and southeast 
and hispanics in those regions arent considered for promotion in 
areas where there is no large hispanic population nonhispanic 
customs employees are brought in from other areas to fill managerial 
slots restricting promotional opportunities it added 
hispanics with criminal enforcement responsibilities are assigned 
regularly to wiretap duty and undercover assignments based on their 
spanishlanguage skills which limits their promotional 
opportunities the suit said 
assignments to wiretap monitoring are involuntary involve 
unusually long hours and often take an agent away from the home 
office the suit said but once the hispanic agents have developed 
the case with that long tedious wiretap work it is turned over for 
conclusion by other nonhispanic agents the suit said 
hispanic agents in the fbi suit made similar allegations about 
burdensome wiretap duty and desirable cases being taken away from 
them 
in 1988 there were 194 million hispanics in the united states 
representing over 8 percent of the population

six former us marines are in vietnam on a 
sentimental visit to remember dead comrades and to help get rid of 
mines they planted two decades ago here is a report on their 
journey by george esper who spent 10 years covering the vietnam war 
for the associated press and is on his second reporting trip there 
since 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
twentyone years ago in what is now only 
a heap of red dirt us marines were crying out corpsman 
corpsman weve got wounded here as hundreds of artillery shells 
rained in on them 
it was here at khe sanh that us marines withstood a 77day 
north vietnamese siege in the winter and spring of 1968 in a classic 
battle of the vietnam war suffering more than 200 men killed and 
1600 wounded out of a garrison of 5500 
six of their former comrades some of whom fought here returned 
tuesday to walk the same battlefield still strewn with shell casings 
and other leavings of war and to honor the men who died 
standing in the fogshrouded valley in what was once the center 
of the base restricted to a red dirt road because of la man to give his 
life for 
another man said frank noe 40 of stoughton mass who served 
at khe sanh during the start of the siege he then led the others in 
the lords prayer 
god bless all of those who gave their life at khe sanh noe 
said after the brief ceremony its just a shame so many guys lost 
their lives not only here but all over the country 
this was a hellhole a pretty scary place to be i sort of get 
that eerie feeling i had the last time i walked through this place 
it brings back a little of that especially with all this fog 
around 
all six were deeply moved as they visited khe sanh one of a 
string of bases at which they served just below what was once the 
demilitarized zone that divided vietnam into north and south at the 
17th parallel during the war the country was reunified in 1975 when 
with the vietnamese communists victory 
gen william c westmoreland the former commander of us forces 
in vietnam once characterized khe sanh as an important cork that 
bottled up north vietnamese troops from moving eastward the souths 
populated coastal regions 
the americans abandoned khe sanh after the siege was lifted and 
engineers from the 11th marines a battalion in which five of the 
men revisiting the site served bulldozed the base 
the battalion planted 100000 land mines and the six americans 
came to vietnam to help get rid of those that remain concealed they 
do not carry any equipment but wanted to point out likely sites 
where mines may be concealed 
this is a trip for me and all the other veterans to put this 
time in our lives to rest and say the lands at peace the wars 
over theres reconciliation between vietnamese and americans 
said mike wallace a 41yearold farmer from langdon kansas 
i think we feel true peace now said gene spanos a 
39yearold police lieutenant from rosemont ill who organized 
vietnam revisited 
if we could just say this to every vietnam veteran who served 
in vietnam that peace is here peace should be at home amongst us 
all they should have their own peace theres no more war here 
its over with 
the marines were on an unofficial goodwill mission of their own 
that they planned for more than a year in inspecting their former 
bases they found that land mines they planted more than 20 years 
ago to protect them from attack still posed a danger to civilians 
this is just a moment in our life were always going to 
treasure a chance to come back said spanos 
it unloaded some excess baggage that i didnt really know i was 
still carrying around said nate genna a 41yearold maintenance 
man from boston we did confirm some serious problems do exist 
here as a result of our actions and we want as much attention 
brought to them as possible 
william johnson a 41yearold electric sign maker from 
manchester conn said it was a good feeling for him to return 
without any fear of danger 
i feel some reward by this trip said johnson i feel i 
have firsthand information about whats happening here the chance 
of people being injured in certain areas these are questions ive 
had its people that had nothing to do with the war that are 
suffering its 20 years later theres no war going on and children 
who werent even around during the war are exposed to danger 
some of the men picked up khe sanh war remnants as mementos to 
take home including a rusted american helmet 
as johnson left the base he picked up a piece of scrap metal 
the remains of a mess kit and cradled it in his hands 
scrap metal he said as he gazed at it but this was 
somebody here 20 years ago a soldier eating 
perhaps one of his fallen comrades

the neatly dressed children at dunbar elementary 
school in riottorn overtown were back walking in straight lines on 
the breezeways and playing on the welltrimmed grounds behind barbed 
wiretopped fences 
a certificate on the office wall proclaims dunbar safe and 
smiling a contrast to the experience of many of its pupils 
during their day off tuesday 
the spanishdesign pastelpeach building on miamis nw 20th st 
in the heart of the overtown neighborhood seems an oasis in the 
middle of the housing projects rundown apartments and overgrown 
lots in the heart of the city 
after the first night of violence sparked by the police shooting 
of an unarmed black motorcyclist monday six schools were closed on 
wednesday dade county reopened schools including dunbar 
nineyearold tiffany dukes said wednesday she sat on her porch 
and watched as her neighborhood smoldered with anger during her day 
at home 
they was shooting in the air and they had caught some stores on 
fire she said they was burning cars in the street 
this part of overtown didnt look like a riot scene wednesday 
but a few signs gave it away broken glass littered the roadway near 
the school a torched grocery store smoldered and two barricades 
marked the police perimeter five blocks away two policemen sat in 
front of the school talking quietly 
the damage in overtown was far worse in the 1982 riot when 
injured people sought refuge in the dunbar cafeteria said 4th grade 
teacher walter allen 
the school has been untouched this time 
tiffany said she was happy to be back at school when asked what 
was causing problems tiffany quickly referred to the dead 
motorcyclist 
the police shot him for nothing she said 
tamika facey 11 said the rioting was so disgusting we were 
really scared 
sherelle poole also 11 said she felt bad about what was 
happening about the disturbance i was sad i was scared 
attendance was low wednesday at dunbar but teachers said parents 
may not have known schools were open again 
five hundred children showed up instead of the usual 1200 
five hundred kids principal maybelline truesdell said 
laughing this is heaven i could love this but not under 
these circumstances 
on the morning announcements i told them how happy we were to 
see them then i told them that if they had any questions or 
concerns their teachers would discuss it with them she said 
but she said none of the children had come forward to talk about 
any difficulties 
the parents have done an excellent job of explaining the 
situation as much as it can be explained she said 
fourthgrader marcine hill didnt seem to be greatly affected 
he said he spent tuesday playing but when the riot started i 
went in the house 
marcine 10 lives on nw third avenue near the heart of the 
disturbance and some of the strongest efforts to quell it 
they threw tear gas he said we put on the fan and put

as thousands of republicans jam the city to 
celebrate george bushs presidential inauguration with balls and 
banquets protesters are staging events on the streets to mark their 
anger at gop policies 
the counterinaugural coalition for a peoples agenda a 
gathering of 80 groups ranging from the gray panthers to the 
committee in solidarity with the people of el salvador launched 
its activities wednesday evening with a soup kitchen dubbed a 
banquet on the plaza in front of union station 
the intended audience was the 2500 republican faithful who were 
climbing out of limousines and taxis at the union station entrance 
for a lavish 1500 per ticket feast of maryland crab and roast 
veal 
about an hour before the official union station dinner was to 
begin several hundred of those who had enjoyed their free meal of 
hot chili and rice tortilla chips salad and apple cider started 
shouting at the gala guests some 100 yards and two police lines 
away 
the extravagance of george bushs inauguration by far the 
most expensive in us history demonstrates how far removed the 
bushquayle administration is from the concerns and worries of most 
american people said lisa fithian a spokeswoman for the 
protesters 
the protesters signs reflected their varied interests one 
banner read house the homeless aid the poor us out of el 
salvador 
what about the homeless they screamed in unison 
fiftythousand dead from aids where was george 
park police officers allowed them to encroach closer to the train 
depot than their permit called for but the officers got 
reinforcements as well as barricades after the shouting started 
but the coalitions 80 groups had agreed in advance not to 
conduct any civil disobedience because we could only do so much 
if we wanted to do it well fithian said we want to ensure that 
we maintain a positive attitude they kept their word wednesday 
night 
the screams were barely audible from the union station entrance 
and the blacktie guests inside expressed little concern about the 
protests 
i feel its ridiculous said seattle business executive 
thomas j stewart they hold these staged events every time 
republicans get together and its in very poor taste 
among the events planned by various protest groups are a no 
honeymoon concert tonight benefiting the christic institute which 
has sued the us government over its central america policies and 
activities scheduled to appear are david crosby graham nash and 
michelle shocked 
in addition the national organization for women plans a silent 
protest friday during the inaugural parade down pennsylvania avenue 
taking off on bushs constant references to a thousand points of 
light 
the demonstrators will wear buttons number 1 to 1000 that light 
up and carry the message keep abortion legal 
the northwest corner of lafayette square across the street from 
the white house has been set aside for demonstrations but there is 
no hourbyhour schedule of who will be able to use the space 
advocates for the homeless and a variety of other problems 
already have called on bush to ask those who contributed money for 
the inaugural celebrations to donate an equal amount to solve those 
problems

a world war ii plane hidden under black plastic 
sheeting near the smithsonian air amp space museum was intended as a 
surprise for george bush as he views his inaugural parade on friday 
parade organizers said they were disappointed wednesday that word 
got out about the plane through news stories the newly painted 
aircraft is a grumman avenger torpedo bomber identical to the one 
bush bailed out of at age 20 after a sortie against the japanese 
organizers had other problems with the aircraft and had to trim 
back trees and move a couple of reviewing stands to make way for its 
54foot wingspan 
the avengers wings could be folded back as they would be aboard 
an aircraft carrier but officials said they wanted to ensure that 
it would be in full flight position when it passed in front of the 
new president the float will also carry about a dozen members of 
bushs former torpedo squadron air group vt 51 
the planes wingspan is so wide bush could almost reach out and 
touch it from his reviewing stand said a navy officer watching over 
the plane 
bush was rescued from the pacific ocean on sept 2 1944 after 
he bailed out of his flaming aircraft over the bonin islands 600 
miles south of japan he won the distinguished flying cross for 
heroism during the bombing raid in which his two crew members were 
killed 
the plane in the parade built in the 1940s by general motors on 
a grumman design was flown to washington by its owner cole stuart 
of valdosta ga after it was spotted by a world war ii veteran 
working with the uss yorktown association in mount pleasant sc 
veterans from the yorktown arranged for the plane to be in the 
parade and also tracked down members of bushs torpedo squadron 
said joseph sharkey assistant director of the yorktown veterans 
group 
about 10000 avengers were built according to grumman historian 
lois louisolo with 45 of the old aircraft still registered to fly

in an emotional reunion 44 years later george 
bush paid tribute to the his world war ii navy flying comrades and 
the submarine crewmen who nicknamed him ellie after pulling him 
from the drink 
fireworks lit up the sky over the lincoln memorial as bush about 
to become the nations 41st president spent half an hour of quiet 
reflection wednesday night with about three dozen of his war buddies 
he spoke with great feeling about what the squadron and the 
finbacks crewmen meant to him said retired rear adm lawrence 
heyworth of virginia beach va mrs bushs eyes kind of teared up 
a little it was very intimate 
heyworth was gunnery and torpedo officer aboard the uss finback 
in september 1944 when bush was one of five young navy aviators 
rescued by the submarine after being shot down by the japanese over 
the pacific 
bush has accorded the finback veterans the widows of a few 
others and an equal number of members of his aircraft carrier 
torpedo squadron vt51 from world war ii the choicest seats at 
several inaugural events 
but first he welcomed them to his temporary quarters at the blair 
house across pennsylvania avenue from the white house for a private 
reunion 
it was very emotional said don kohler 64 of rogers ark 
the submarine torpedoman who helped pull bush out of his bobbing 
orange life raft onto the deck of the finback after he had bailed 
out of his flaming torpedo bomber on sept 2 1944 
you have to remember that few of us had seen any of the others 
from the finback for 44 years kohler said and meeting under 
these circumstances where the presidentelect personally welcomes 
us it was pretty moving 
kohler said bush told the group that the youngness that was 
there all those years ago and the things we were fighting for had a 
great deal to do with directing his life and ideas 
bush spent a few moments with each of the veterans signing 
pictures looking at their scrapbooks swapping remembrances 
heyworth quoted bush as saying if it werent for you people in 
this room i wouldnt be here and i certainly wouldnt have been 
elected president of the united states 
hugo parkman 69 of stone mountain ga the finbacks 
communications officer recalled bush as a very cleancut young 
man 
i shared my bunk with him parkman said that is when i 
was on duty he slept and when he was on duty i slept on a 
submarine everythings so tight bunks dont get cold 
he was a very regular guy said parkman we never knew that 
he came from a distinguished family he didnt tell anybody anything 
about that 
we bill edwards of bay st louis miss an insurance agent 
and retired navy commander recalled that bush was nicknamed 
ellie by the submarines crewmen because he would imitate a 
braying elephant but it had nothing to do with his aspiring 
politics 
we had a nickname for everyone aboard and george was a very 
smart fun loving guy edwards said he was always joking 
mimicking this elephant i think hed seen too many tarzan movies 
then a 20yearold lieutenant and the navys youngest pilot bush 
was flying a bombing run against a japanese radio communications 
center in the bonin islands 600 miles south of japan when enemy fire 
struck his tbm avenger he later won a distinguished flying cross 
for completing the run before bailing out of the flaming plane

the police chief said he has major concerns in 
understanding why a police officer shot to death a black 
motorcyclist who was being sought for speeding 
there seem to be some unusual occurrences in the shooting of 
23yearold clement lloyd which sparked three days of riots police 
chief perry anderson said wednesday night on abctvs nightline 
a police officer chased lloyd because he was speeding 
colombianborn officer william lozano who fired the shot that 
struck lloyd in the head was taking a report from a crime victim in 
an unrelated incident when lloyd sped by authorities said 
there might have been a perception of a more serious crime 
being committed by the officer lozano but were looking at that 
to determine exactly what transpired the chief said 
anderson said the law prevented him from discussing aspects of 
the investigation into monday evenings shooting but added we 
have major concerns in dealing with the reason why the officer fired 
the shot 
lozano was relieved of duty with pay pending the investigation 
the shooting is being investigated by the police internal review 
board the fbi the state attorneys office and a special panel 
approved by city commissioners in an emergency session wednesday 
the miamidade police department has a strict 20page policy on 
the circumstances under which officers may shoot at a fleeing 
suspect 
it says an officer can use deadly force only to prevent death 
or substantial harm to the officer or another person or to 
prevent the escape of a fleeing felon who would pose a real threat 
of death or substantial harm to the community or police officers 
the policy says the department places a greater value on the 
preservation of life than on the protection of property officers 
will use deadly force with great restraint and as a last resort 
deadly force shall not be used against misdemeanors and traffic 
violators it says 
the policy also says that shooting at or from a moving vehicle 
is a dangerous and ineffective practice and is generally prohibited 
however there may be unique situations or mitigating 
circumstances in which an officer may be justified in using 
firearms it says

reductions in the soviet unions armed forces president mikhail s 
gorbachev said troops will be cut by 12 percent and the military 
budget trimmed by 142 percent

rebuffed suggestions that only obsolete tanks would be destroyed

eliminated in europe of which 5000 will be physically 
liquidated and the others transformed into towing vehicles for 
civilian needs or into training simulators

move by claiming that only obsolete armored vehicles would be 
destroyed 
heres the way it is we will withdraw 5000 of the most modern 
tanks from our military groups gorbachev said

the drought of 1988 was the nations worst 
natural disaster on record causing an estimated 30 billion in 
agricultural losses and its releated heat wave contributed to 
10000 deaths researchers reported 
if these data are correct its the number one natural disaster 
in this country said john a dracup a civil engineer at the 
university of california los angeles who is developing ways to 
assess drought severity 
the second worst was the hurricane that struck galveston texas 
on sept 8 1900 killing 6000 people dracup said 
norman rosenberg of resources for the future in washington dc 
said more bad news is on the way 
the drought of 1988 is not over he said a large portion 
of the country still remains vulnerable if we have a dry spring we 
could have a very serious situation 
rosenberg and dracup were among a panel of experts who gathered 
at the annual meeting of the american association for the 
advancement of science to assess the effects of the drought 
stanley a changnon of the illinois state water survey who has 
tried to tally the damages said the drought was slightly less 
severe in area and intensity than the droughts of 19321936 and 
19531956 
nevertheless 70 percent of the nation experienced extensively 
warm and dry conditions he said wheat corn and soybean 
production fell by 30 percent to 40 percent 
agricultural losses throughout the united states totaled 30 
billion even though all the damage has not yet been tallied 
including the droughts effect on feed development the livestock 
industry and the consumer who faces an increase of 2 percent to 4 
percent in food prices changnon said 
summer high temperatures set records for any date in 13 percent 
of the country contributing to an estimated 10000 deaths related 
to heat stress changnon said 
the most longlasting effects will be losses to the environment 
changnon said the populations of certain species of wildlife in the 
mississippi river basin were reduced by 5 percent to 30 percent the 
damage due to forest fires was the greatest on record 
changnon and the other researchers did not give details of how 
they derived their figures on the droughts severity 
falling water levels in the mississippi river stopped barge 
traffic in june and july greatly disrupting shipments of coal 
grains and petroleum products 
the researchers agreed it was impossible to say whether the 
drought was evidence that the global warming known as the greenhouse 
effect was beginning to take hold 
stephen h schneider of the national center for atmospheric 
research in boulder colorado said that the greenhouse effect could 
be expected to increase the severity of droughts but not their 
frequency 
whether the drought of 1988 was intensified by an underlying 
greenhouse effect or was just caused by unusual seasonal weather 
variations cannot be determined he said 
schneider said most climatologists believe the immediate cause of 
the drought was colderthanusual temperatures in the tropical 
pacific ocean which are known to affect weather in the united 
states 
david r rodenhuis director of the climate analysis center at 
the national weather service said 26 percent of the continental 
united states received less than half its normal rainfall during 
april may and june 1988 
in late july 40 percent of the united states was covered by 
severe or extreme drought conditions rodenhuis said 
we still do have a continuing dryness in the northern plains 
and the northwest part of the country he said

a nuclear researcher says there is reason to 
believe that a linear accelerator could be used to help neutralize 
highly radioactive waste in addition to producing tritium a key 
ingredient in atomic warheads 
rod powell manager of engineering development at the 
westinghousehanford co in washington state said wednesday that 
highlevel radioactive waste could be bombarded with neutrons in an 
accelerator and changed into lowlevel radioactive waste 
it would be a new twist powell said in a telephone 
interview he cautioned that the technology still needs to be proven 
in a pilot project but added that the japanese are already studying 
the possibility of using an accelerator for such a purpose 
the federal government is currently grappling with the problem of 
disposing of massive amounts of highly radioactive waste both from 
commercial nuclear reactors and from the production of nuclear 
weapons 
existing plans call for storing the waste in an underground 
repository in nevada but the project has already been fraught with 
problems and delays 
scientists at westinghousehanford and at the los alamos and 
brookhaven national laboratories have been studying the idea of 
using an accelerator to produce tritium a radioactive gas used in 
nuclear warheads for more than a year 
the work comes amid increasing concern about the reliability and 
safety at the energy departments three tritium producing reactors 
at the savannah river complex in south carolina 
powell said that researchers were convinced that an accelerator 
could be used to produce enough tritium to meet demand and also be 
used for other purposes 
the accelerator could also be used to produce special isotopes 
for everything from sophisticated medical equipment to a new device 
that the federal aviation administration is developing to detect 
plastic explosives he said 
an accelerator is essentially a long tunnel in which subatomic 
particles are whipped at high speeds until they crash into a target 
in this case lithium clad in aluminum the resulting collision 
produces tritium 
in using an accelerator to deal with radioactive waste powell 
said the process is essentially similar 
as an example powell said the most deadly elements could be 
separated from spent fuel rods from a nuclear reactor and than 
bombarded with neutrons in an accelerator 
the actual word is transmutate said powell it could be a 
way of disposing of radioactive waste 
the energy department provided 300000 to initially fund 
research into using an accelerator for tritium production but no 
funding was provided in the current fiscal year powell said 
according to a copy of a summary report prepared by the 
scientists and obtained by the associated press last week an 
accelerator could produce tritium more cheaply quickly and safely 
than a nuclear reactor 
last july the energy department recommended construction of two 
new tritium producing reactors one at the savannah river complex in 
south carolina and the other at the idaho falls national laboratory 
in idaho 
powell said the researchers were disappointed when the department 
didnt decide to pursue the accelerator alternative but decided to 
continue the work

the opposition verbally assaulted 
chancellor helmut kohl in parliament alleging his government tried 
to cover up west germany companies involvement in a suspected 
libyan chemical weapons plant 
the question is what you knew and what you did about it 
opposition lawmaker norbert gansel said as kohl sat grimly next to 
the speakers podium 
you herr chancellor are politically and personally 
responsible that the german and international public were deceived 
for a long time gansel a social democrat and an expert on 
weapons charged during wednesdays debate 
the united states alleges the libyan plant in the desert about 
40 miles from tripoli is on the verge of fullscale production of 
chemical weapons libya denies the charge saying the plant will 
produce pharmaceuticals 
wolfgang schaeuble kohls chief of staff opened wednesdays 
twohour debate by saying the us embassy in bonn first informed 
west german officials in may about possible west german involvement 
in the plant 
but the may notification date is five months earlier than what 
the government acknowledged monday and six months earlier than what 
west german leaders mentioned three weeks ago after washington 
forced the issue public 
initially the bonn government angrily denied the us 
allegations that west german companies were involved in the plant 
it also denied knowing the complex could produce poison gas 
officials have since said the government did not immediately say 
what it knew because that would have jeopardized west german 
investigations 
at least three west german companies are now under criminal 
investigation for dealings with libya two are suspected of 
involvement in the construction and outfitting of the plant in 
rabta one of helping refit libyan warplanes so they can refuel in 
midflight 
opposition lawmakers shouted and hooted during schaeubles 
speech interrupting him several times 
schaeuble rejected any suggestion west german authorities had 
tried to cover up the affair 
he said that in august 1987 west german intelligence services 
received information the plant in all probability was intended 
for producing chemical weapons he said there was no evidence at the 
time of west german involvement in the plant 
kohl received his first comprehensive report on the 
suspicions oct 20 schaeuble said 
he also said that on the basis of intelligence reports we must 
assume that this plant in rabta is intended to produce chemical 
weapons 
according to schaeuble new reports by the west german 
intelligence service gave clear indications of involvement by 
german companies in the libyan factory 
schaeuble said that on dec 14 west german investigators met with 
an informant who gave them documents indicating involvement by 
the west german firm imhausenchemie in the libyan plant according 
to schaeuble the informant said other documents could be obtained 
from ibi engineering a nowdefunct company that was based in 
frankfurt 
criminal investigations have been launched against imhausen 
based in lahr and ibi which allegedly organized participation 
by other west german companies in the libyan plant 
although kohl was present during the debate he did not speak a 
government spokesman said schaeuble delivered the speech because it 
was a matter of protocol 
schaeuble in an interview later wednesday with west german 
television said the government had now disclosed everything it 
knows to parliament there is no need now from my viewpoint for 
further disclosure 
prosecutors also said wednesday that they are investigating a 
report the intec technical trade and logistik company that is based 
outside munich has been helping libya develop the ability to refuel 
its warplanes while in flight to extend their range 
meanwhile in belgium us gen william burns director of the 
arms control and disarmament agency said the thing now to do is 
to allow the german government to deal with this problem as a 
domestic issue

an energy industry trade group says us oil 
imports hit a nineyear high in 1988 as americans used more energy 
than in any year in history 
the american petroleum institute representing the bigger oil 
producers and refiners said us consumption of all types of energy 
rose 4 percent last year surpassing the previous record set in 
1979 the year the last oil crisis struck 
oil imports last year jumped nearly 9 percent to a rate of 72 
million barrels a day which was the highest level since 1979 
the group said its index of energy efficiency the amount of 
energy used to produce each unit of economic output suggests a 
small improvement for 1988 over the previous year if the figures 
are adjusted for seasonal factors such as weather

the energy department has formally crowned 
texas the winner of a sevenstate battle to host a proposed 59 
billion superconducting super collider 
at a formal ceremony attended by texas gov bill clements john 
herrington the energy secretary signed an official record of 
decision wednesday to build the massive physics installation 
around the city of waxahachie about 25 miles south of dallas 
the collider is envisioned as a 53mile underground ring that 
would use 10000 magnets to whirl beams of protons into each other 
at energy levels 20 times what is possible in todays most powerful 
machines 
scientists will use the facility to be called the ronald reagan 
center for highenergy physics to explore the nature of matter and

a federal government scientist says the best 
cheapest way to explore mars would be to land astronauts on the 
planets moons rather than on the surface of the planet 
fred singer an astronomer and the department of transportations 
chief scientist said that putting researchers on either phobos or 
deimos would enable engineers to direct mobile robot craft to 
explore and collect samples from the martian surface 
sending an expedition to the moons of mars has the advantage of 
being the best we could do the least expensive and the soonest 
singer said wednesday in a luncheon address at the touchdown club 
my hope that the time is right now for us to go in this 
direction

the bitterness that lingers after eight 
years of war is still so intense that diplomats say they doubt there 
will be progress in iraniraq peace talks when a un mediator 
visits the region next week 
but they say they hope at least for the resumption of prisoner 
exchanges 
un secretarygeneral javier perez de cuellar is sending swedish 
un ambassador jan k eliasson to baghdad and tehran in an effort 
to persuade iraq and iran to show some flexibility 
both sides accepted a ceasefire on aug 20 but peace talks that 
opened five days later deadlocked almost immediately 
a 1987 security council resolution calls on both countries to 
halt all military activities withdraw their troops to the border 
exchange about 100000 war prisoners and talk peace 
iraq still occupies about 260 square miles of iranian territory 
and says it will not withdraw until iran gives up the right to 
search ships for war cargo bound for iraq it considers that a 
military activity 
iran which has not stopped any iraqibound ships since the 
ceasefire began says the withdrawal to the border must be the next 
step in the peace process 
un officials and diplomats speaking wednesday on condition of 
anonymity did not foresee progress on those issues but said 
progress was possible on the exchange of sick or injured pows and 
other technical measures 
both sides have also given the united nations expressions of 
interest in resuming the exchange of pows the un official said 
last year the international committee of the red cross worked 
out a plan to register all pows and send home sick or injured pows 
but the arrangement broke down after just a few dozen had been 
exchanged 
one of the un officials also said iran and iraq appear ready to 
begin direct contacts between military officers to discuss their 
frequent complaints about ceasefire violations 
the official who spoke on condition of anonymity also said he 
hoped for progress on substantial issues including the impasse over 
the shattalarab waterway forming the border between iran and iraq 
but noted these are matters of deeper pride 
the waterway is iraqs only deepwater access to the persian gulf

george bush was toasted with champagne 
serenaded by the whiffenpoof songsters from yale and cheered at a 
1500aplate inaugural dinner by republican fat cats who refused 
to let chanting protesters and homeless onlookers spoil their party 
outside union station on wednesday night street people stood 
eating a soupkitchen supper of chili and rice off paper plates 
while protesters shouted chants of food for the poor not the 
rich and what about the homeless at stretch limousines 
delivering blacktie guests to the dinner inside 
once the police erected barricades and shooed away several 
hundred demonstrators about 2500 republican party stalwarts and 
wealthy contributors settled down at three great halls around town 
to feast on maryland crab and mushroomstuffed loins of veal washed 
down with california wines from crystal goblets 
just as the diners were polishing off the applecranberry brown 
betty with cinnamon ice cream and bourbon custard presidentelect 
bush and dan quayle his vice presidenttobe arrived in the 
vaulted main hall of union station from visits to other dinners at 
the pension building and the corcoran gallery of art 
they were running 25 minutes late were exhausted bush 
said but the gops big spenders finally got what they paid for 
and they went slightly wild heraldic trumpets blared from a 
balcony cameras flashed women in sequined gowns and glittering 
necklaces left tables decked with floral trees of white roses and 
pushed forward bush waved and smiled 
im gonna try my level best to be a good president of the 
united states and work for all the people of the united states 
he said 
youve given me a chance and im not going to let you down 
bush and penne percy korth cochairman of the inaugural 
committee toasted each other with champagne bush waved his arm and 
mouthed the words of his school song sung by the whiffenpoof glee 
club of his alma mater yale university 
then he plunged into the crowd of wellwishers shaking hands 
waving and exchanging hugs for the next 10 minutes bush thanked 
them for the financial support that helped him win the presidency 
and for underwriting the four days of inaugural festivities with 
100000 interestfree loans 
earlier on the plaza facing the newly refurbished train station 
demonstrators served a counterinaugural banquet to several 
dozen homeless people from large metal pots steaming in the glare of 
television lights and entertained them with folk singers and 
proabortion street theater 
michael hasty of the washington peace center said it was sick 
decadent for the republicans to eat 1500 dinners while people 
are homeless and starving on the streets 
weve fed over 1000 people so far tonight with less than a 
200 budget he said i wonder how long it would take for 
somebody out on the street to beg for 1500 in spare change 
a halfhour before the dinner inside began at 8 pm the crowd 
pushed closer to the arriving limousines and police erected 
barricades to prevent a spontaneous surge toward the stations main 
entrance the protesters dispersed peacefully just as their 
threehour permit expired 
us park police also banished from the plaza a halfdozen 
conservative republican activists carrying american flags who said 
they wanted to demonstrate against the antipoverty demonstrators 
sgt robert kass said the conservatives lacked a permit 
grace stepp 36 a homeless person paused between spoonfuls of 
chili to say the inaugural diners should help us out too they 
should get us more shelters and stuff 
roosevelt carrington 30 a homeless unemployed carpenter said 
he thought the blacktie guests should come out and eat the same 
thing were having so theyll know what its like 
but inside many of the party faithful waiting to pass through 
metal detectors at the entrance said they had hardly noticed the 
demonstrators and their shouted messages 
thomas j stewart a seattle business executive termed 
ridiculous the protesters suggestion that the 225 million in 
proceeds from the inaugural dinners would be better spent helping 
the poor and homeless 
they hold these staged events every time republicans get 
together and its in very poor taste stewart said 
the people here tonight have probably contributed more as 
individuals and corporations to the welfare of this country than 
anybody else said jim hewgley a tulsa okla oilman if they 
want to celebrate then by god theyre entitled to 
stew jackson president of a burglar alarm company in denver 
predicted that bush would do a lot for the homeless which he 
endorses but i also support those who do something to help 
themselves jackson said 
david eller of ft lauderdale fla a water pump manufacturer 
and weekly newspaper publisher who qualifies as a republican 
eagle for donating a minimum of 10000 to party campaigns said 
there were plenty of jobs available for the homeless if theyd 
rather protest than do an honest days work i dont have too much 
sympathy for them he said

elvis presley is no longer king and sole 
ruler at radio station whos but hes still a good guy says 
station manager mack bramlett 
because of poor ratings the am station has abandoned the 
allelvis format it adopted in october bramlett said it is now 
simultaneously broadcasting the country music format of its sister 
station wdrmfm 
when whos switched from a gospel format toelvis billboards in 
decatur proclaimed that elvis was indeed alive 
we gave it the promotion it needed bramlett said but he 
said the effort failed because more than 75 percent of radio 
listeners tune in to fm stations which provide better sound quality 
people just dont use am anymore he said 
two other am stations waay and wajf recently succumbed to a 
decreasing audience and went off the air but bramlett said he 
expects whos to survive 
if it were not for the fm station we would be taking it hard 
he said 
bramlett said he is searching for ideas for a new format 
we have to find something that will serve the public and 
survive at the same time he said

psychologists say mass murderers like the 
drifter who sprayed rifle fire at his boyhood school are part of a 
recent unprecedented wave of grandstand suicides expressing a 
hairtrigger anger at the world 
but some experts warn that such acts of violence whether they 
represent a copycat trend or are only isolated incidents should not 
turn the nations schools into armed camps 
the issue took on new significance as police investigated the 
motivations of patrick purdy a drifter who returned to his former 
elementary school on tuesday and opened fire on a crowd of children 
killing five students and wounding 30 people before killing himself 
for these people it is typically their last chance to show 
society how angry they are michael mantell chief psychologist 
for the san diego police department said wednesday striking 
out at children is their way of building up their flagging egos by 
taking out their frustration on young victims 
its the fad of the last year weve had more this last year 
than ever before said james alan fox coauthor of mass murder 
americas growing menace and a psychologist and criminology 
professor at northeastern university in boston 
during 1988 there were five shooting rampages at public schools 
in the united states 
fox noted that 19yearold jamie wilson charged with two counts 
of murder in an attack on a greenwood sc elementary school last 
year was reported to be a fan of laurie dann the woman who 
shot and killed herself after gunning down children at a winnetka 
ill elementary school earlier in 1988 
but despite the increasing number of school shootings they cant 
all be blamed on copycats although mass murder locations tend to 
cluster fox said after the massacre of 21 people at a mcdonalds 
restaurant in san ysidro near san diego in 1984 there was a 
similar but less deadly attack on another mcdonalds in detroit 
you do it mass murder in a confined place like a restaurant 
a mcdonalds or a school he said calling such bursts of 
violence revenge against society for a lifetime of frustrations 
and what better way to do it than take it out on children the 
thing that is most dear to us he said 
mantell described purdys death as a grandstand suicide 
the reason people do that grandstand suicide is often to say 
to the world i am important look at me mantell said 
someone who has given up on life has nothing to lose 
police said purdy wore an olivedrab shirt bearing the iranian 
battle cry death to the great satin sic and the words plo 
and libya 
carved into the stock of the assault rifle was the word 
hezbollah the name of the radical shiite moslem faction 
believed holding american hostages in lebanon also carved into the 
rifle were the words freedom and victory 
what the significance of that is i do not know said stockton 
police capt dennis perry he obviously had a military hangup of 
some kind 
purdy who killed himself after shooting the children selected a 
school he attended several years as a child its very likely that 
he had some bad experience there maybe he was ridiculed as a 
child fox said as random as it seems its very specific 
namely getting back at this place 
a day after the stockton murders 227 of an expected 940 
cleveland elementary school students returned to class wednesday 
said schools spokesman john klose individual and group grief 
counseling sessions were available to the children teachers and 
parents he said adding that it appeared to be working very 
well 
school officials decided to keep the school open after staff 
psychologists agreed the preponderance of the evidence supported 
going back immediately klose said but he said an outside 
psychologist told them they made a mistake so there are two 
schools of thought on this 
either way there is a wound here that will affect them to some 
degree for the rest of their lives said tom rusk associate 
professor of clinical psychiatry at the university of california 
san diego i dont care what kind of therapy is available you 
cannot erase this 
sam sava executive director of the national association of 
elementary school principals in alexandria va said the 
association pleaded last october for schools to implement security 
plans 
sava said things have changed and we cant have our youngsters 
walking around like blind mice and we have to use the best 
educational techniques to help children cope with these dangers 
mantell also urged school authorities to develop security plans 
but he cautioned against turning elementary campuses into armed 
camps 
theres very little we can do or should do added fox we 
start making our schools into fortresses well make our kids 
paranoid 
san francisco school superintendent ramon cortines said after 
tuesdays shooting that he would ask principals to take 
extraordinary precautions for safety 
this shows how vulnerable our children and employees are he 
said you cant take any chances with their safety

the man with the microphone was preaching jesus 
through a battered speaker near the liberty city checkpoint his 
love is eeeternal he intoned as police checked motorists in 
the garish light of flares and squad car flashers 
a few miles north officers in helmets and flak vests closed in 
on a house that might have been the source of gunfire while fellow 
officers laughed and lounged a hundred feet away 
the streets of miamis overtown and liberty city neighborhoods 
were a little easier wednesday night but they were still far from 
normal 
the looting and gunfire that punctuated the past two nights was 
muted police were still out in force they wore body armor and 
toted loaded shotguns but this night they sipped sodas and snacked 
on sandwiches and ice cream as their radios occasionally crackled 
with reports of car fires smashed store windows and rock throwing 
the picnics spread out on squad car hoods spoke to the relative 
calm of the evening so did the numbers that were being compiled 
back at police headquarters officials reported 50 arrests by 1 
am largely for rockthrowing incidents overnight tuesday there 
were 325 arrests mostly for looting 
we hope we can normalize the situation and get back to routine 
patrolling said deputy police chief walter martinez 
the biggest problem for gary wilcox a police sergeant who manned 
a liberty city checkpoint was fending off outsiders who wanted to 
tour the riot scene 
well ask people where theyre from and theyll say kendall 
a white suburb southwest of the city when we ask them why 
theyre here theyll say just to see what its like according 
to wilcox 
the violence sparked by the fatal police shooting of a black 
motorcyclist monday had not entirely abated police were fired upon 
at least twice one man was arrested for shooting at a squad car 
from an apartment window caravans of police vehicles known as 
field force units rushed through neighborhoods 
one field force unit screeched to a halt in front of lee and 
ritas grocery after officers thought they heard shots three men 
lounging in front of the store were forced to the ground while 
special weapons and tactics teams checked an adjacent apartment 
building 
the men remained on the ground watched by two officers the rest 
of the unit leaned on their cars talking and joking while the swat 
unit made its cautious rounds when they failed to find evidence of 
a sniper the men on the ground were released 
were just trying to get the people off the streets without 
disrupting their lives and making sure were selective about who we 
arrest said lt nelson oramas 
but mostly the night seemed an aftermath of the previous two 
evenings 
at the edge of little haiti manuel gorelick stood outside his 
halfempty furniture store with some friends on the street was a 
huge iron grate that looters pulled off the storefront tuesday night 
after chaining it to a stolen car 
the street was dotted with rocks the ammunition used by rioters 
on previous nights across the street silent clusters of youths 
stared at gorelick and his partner gilberto cusido who had one 
revolver tucked in his waistband and another in his hip pocket 
ive been here for 10 years gorelick said ive been 
broken into for six times a couple of times there were riots here 
but this is the worst 
gorelick estimated looters carried off 40000 of furniture but 
he had no plans of closing down 
were going to stay here still he said as the knots of 
youths across the street continued to stare were still serving 
the community

it was really among the first studies that began showing a 
strong link franz said his epidemiological work population 
studies showed a higher incidence of lung cancer among smokers 
shimkin who joined the ucsd faculty in 1969 began researching

press poll agreed he should not seek a tax increase but 71 percent 
said they think he will 
even still the survey found high approval ratings for bush who 
takes office friday as the 41st president respondents voiced high 
expectations for his presidency and gave him strong marks for his 
cabinet choices 
a solid 59 percent said they viewed bush favorably precisely the 
same approval rate president reagan received in a media generalap 
poll last spring only 25 percent rated bush unfavorably the rest 
withheld judgment 
bush fared well in another comparison with his popular 
predecessor expectations for his presidency came close to the 
ratings of reagans performance in a media generalap poll conducted 
this fall 
fortyeight percent in the new poll said bush would be a good 
president and 13 percent said he would be excellent this fall 47 
percent said reagan would be recorded in history as a good 
president 20 percent excellent 
the new poll was conducted by telephone jan 412 among a random 
sample of 1162 adults nationwide it has a 3point margin of 
sampling error 
although many respondents were unfamiliar with bushs nominees

researchers today reported the first very 
promising evidence outside a test tube that an experimental new 
treatment will slow the lethal spread of the aids virus inside the 
body 
the medicine cd4 apparently works as a decoy mimicking the 
blood cells that the virus usually infects and kills 
in a report in todays journal nature researchers reported that 
the treatment dramatically reduced the level of virus in monkeys 
infected with the simian version of the aids virus 
this is the first evidence in vivo in a living animal that it 
has antiviral effects with chronic administration in a relevant 
animal model said dr robert schooley of massachusetts general 
hospital 
that still leaves the question of whether or not there will be 
parallel positive effects in humans he said but it does 
increase the enthusiasm and the likelihood one would push on with 
more extensive studies 
recently schooley and others began testing cd4 on people 
infected with hiv the human aids virus but the results will not be 
known for weeks 
this approach looks very promising for aids said dr norman 
l letvin senior author of the monkey study 
the treatment cannot wipe out the virus when hidden inside the 
bodys cells however if it works as researchers hope it will 
absorb loose virus that is roaming the bloodstream looking for new 
cells to take over 
the latest research conducted at the harvardaffiliated new 
england regional primate research center suggests that cd4 will do 
just that it showed that when given to infected rhesus monkeys the 
drug dramatically reduced levels of the virus 
the monkeys were infected with simian immunodeficiency virus of 
macaques or siv a close relative of the virus that causes acquired 
immune deficiency syndrome in humans monkeys that catch siv grow 
sick and die of an illness that closely mirrors human aids 
even if the treatment works as well in people as it does in 
monkeys it will not cure aids but it might make life better for 
victims of the virus 
what one would predict on the basis of these monkey studies is 
that if the drug is well tolerated in humans there is every reason 
to hope that patients should live significantly longer and feel 
significantly better letvin said 
researchers tested cd4 on six monkeys two were healthy and the 
drug had no adverse effects on them the four others had been 
infected for more than a year and had varying stages of disease 
the animals showed a very dramatic response when we looked at 
our ability to isolate virus from them during and immediately 
following treatment letvin said 
the infected animals received daily injections of cd4 for 50 
days virus in their blood and bone marrow largely disappeared 
within two weeks of the start of treatment and returned after the 
treatment stopped 
the animals marrow which makes blood cells also regained 
strength during the treatment an effect that letvin said was 
surprising 
the sickest of the four died of severe anemia after the treatment 
stopped letvin said that anemia is sometimes caused by the disease 
but the researchers could not rule out the possibility that it was 
also triggered by the treatment 
cd4 is a natural molecule thats found on the surface of some 
blood cells among these are the chief victims of the aids virus 
scavenger cells called macrophages and helper t cells that 
coordinate the bodys response to infections 
when the aids virus gets into the body it is attracted to cells 
that carry cd4 the virus locks onto the cd4 and worms its way 
inside then it takes over the cell eventually turning into a 
factory to make more virus 
the new drug is a soluble form of cd4 made through genetic 
engineering theoretically it provides so many targets for the 
virus that it is lured harmlessly away from uninfected cells 
letvins monkey research and schooleys human testing is being 
done with a form of cd4 made by biogen inc a biotechnology firm in 
cambridge mass human testing has also begun with cd4 made by 
genentech in south san francisco

a gunman who killed five elementary school pupils and wounded 30 
in california before killing himself with a sovietdesigned assault 
rifle has rekindled the issue of gun control 
we never believed private citizens ought to have weapons of 
war said barbara lautman spokeswoman for handgun control the 
antigun lobby in washington dc 
why would someone need an assault weapon the average sportsman 
or hunter does not need a weapon capable of firing 100 rounds a 
minute it defies logic she said wednesday in a telephone 
interview 
but progun forces defended the right of citizens to own guns 
saying that more judicious prosecution of the gunman on previous 
arrests would have put him behind bars and averted the bloodbath 
its a case study of the failure of the criminal justice system 
that this man was on the streets said david conover a lobbyist 
with the national rifle association we continue to oppose 
restrictive gun control measures 
gun control laws in general dont work said craig markva of 
gun owners of america a lobbying group in washington dc 
everybody will be calling for mandatory background checks but 
he would have slipped through the cracks even if he had a background 
check 
patrick edward purdy wearing a military flak jacket and 
earplugs killed himself after firing up to 110 rounds from a 
bayonetequipped semiautomatic ak47 assault rifle at youngsters 
on recess tuesday at cleveland elementary school in stockton he 
also had two handguns 
purdy 26 bought the rifle which he inscribed with the words 
freedom and victory for 147 in august in sandy ore he 
had at least four prior arrests in california none of which 
resulted in a felony conviction 
under federal law no felon can legally buy a gun 
purdy pleaded guilty in 1983 to possessing martial arts weapons 
which were wooden bars connected with chains according to al 
albergate in the los angeles county district attorneys office he 
was jailed for five days 
purdy also was charged with possession of marijuana receiving 
stolen property and prostitution but police said charges either 
were dropped or they did not know the disposition of the case 
stockton police also said purdy was charged with robbery and the 
manufacture or sale of an illegal weapon but prosecutors in los 
angeles were not aware of the charges or their outcome 
this is a person who should never be able to buy a weapon its 
too late for the children who are dead and dying said gerald 
arenberg of the national association of chiefs of police 
a referedum to ban handguns will apparently be on the april 4 
ballot in winnetka ill where an emotionally disturbed babysitter 
laurie dann 30 went on a rampage may 20 at the hubbard woods 
elementary school 
she killed an 8yearold boy and wounded five other children 
before killing herself she had three handguns she bought at a local 
shop 
weve got to stop this said christine munroe a parent who 
led a petition drive to have handguns banned ive always been 
against handguns their only purpose is to kill another person i 
dont want anybody threatening my children 
no gun control bans were proposed in greenwood sc where james 
wilson a 19yearold with psychiatric problems killed two students 
and wounded seven pupils and two teachers wilson used a 22 caliber 
revolver he took from his grandmother 
the california shootings revived anguish among school officials 
people who have emotional problems and want to take revenge on 
society are picking on our most vulnerable point our children 
said school superintendent robert watson of greenwood 
small children are concentrated in groups they dont run very 
fast they cant get away principals and teachers arent much of a 
match for someone with a gun

a magazine that blossomed under glasnost and ran 
stories this week on corruption pollution and suicide has come 
under attack in two leading newspapers indicating some leading 
communist officials may be getting fed up 
seven prominent cultural figures in a letter published wednesday 
in the communist party daily newspaper pravda bitterly attacked the 
magazine ogonyok saying it went far outside the bounds of 
literary arguments 
those signing the letter including conservative writers valentin 
rasputin and vasily belov said they supported with all their 
souls president mikhail s gorbachevs reforms but had become 
alarmed by scum bubbling up on the crest of the mighty stream of 
renovation 
izvestia the governments afternoon newspaper ran its own 
correspondents article wednesday that cast doubt on ogonyoks 
credibility 
he also wondered aloud why ogonyoks editorinchief vitaly 
korotich was trying to run in a moscow neighborhood for a seat in a 
new national assembly the council of peoples deputies to be 
elected in march 
izvestia correspondent a stepovoi said some soviet social 
organizations that are entitled to direct representation in the 
assembly have already named korotich as a candidate 
the ogonyok editor was seen by millions of us television 
viewers when cbs news anchorman dan rather visited with him in a 
segment of the networks 1987 documentary on soviet life seven 
days in may 
under gorbachevs policy of glasnost or greater openness the 
magazine has been transformed from a staid journal to a lively and 
popular magazine 
ogonyok has drawn tough and insulting criticism from other soviet 
media before but pravda on wednesday gave great prominence to its 
critical letter printing it above the fold on its back page that 
placement in the partys top daily could indicate highlevel 
irritation at ogonyok 
many of the sensational revelations made by soviet media under 
glasnost have appeared in ogonyok whose title means small fire 
in this weeks issue the slick magazine with more 3 million 
subscribers nationwide revealed soviet suicide statistics for recent 
years denounced pollution and ran the latest episode of an expose 
on corruption and cronyism under the late soviet leader leonid i 
brezhnev 
since the magazine has been one of the leaders in the drive for 
franker discussion of social problems and a more honest 
comingtogrips with the countrys past any official attack on it 
would be perceived by many soviets as a signal of glasnosts limits 
the seven cultural figures grouped ogonyok along with soviet 
publications they said are engaged in an unprecedented distortion 
of history and that revise the social achievements of the people 
the magazine has taken upon itself the role of a kind of judge 
on all questions of social life politics the economy culture and 
morals they wrote 
they accused it of printing unverified hearsay and of deprecating 
soviet cultural icons such as poet vladimir mayakovsky and nobel 
literature laureate mikhail sholokhov author of and quiet flows

up to 665000 panasonic customers victimized by a 
nationwide pricefixing scheme are due as much as 16 million in 
refunds from the japanese consumer electronics giant officials said 
the settlement panasonic agreed to wednesday could be extended to 
every state except hawaii new york state attorney general robert 
abrams told a news conference 
abrams said panasonic cheated customers by illegally pressuring 
thousands of retailers including such major chains as k mart and 
montgomery ward to charge list price 
there was an elaborate nationwide policing scheme whereby 
certain retailers acted as stool pigeons as rats and they would 
report that somebody down the street is charging less said lloyd 
constantine chief of the attorney generals antitrust bureau 
abrams said other electronics manufacturers were being 
investigated but declined to identify them or say whether there 
would be any charges 
the settlement in which panasonic denied wrongdoing was filed 
in us district court 
we voluntarily resolved the matter in the belief that a quick 
settlement would help avoid protracted and costly litigation and 
disruption to our dealers and our business said ralph wolfe vice 
president of panasonic a division of matsushita electric corp of 
america with headquarters in secaucus nj 
abrams said the scheme involved 16 products sold under the 
panasonic and technics labels including videocassette recorders 
video cameras cordless phones answering machines and stereo 
equipment 
panasonic agreed in the settlement to make refunds of at least 
85 million and up to 16 million to customers nationwide who 
purchased its products between march 1 and aug 31 of last year 
panasonic prices were 5 percent to 10 percent higher on average 
because of the scheme abrams said 
in a few short months over 15 million was extorted from 
consumers in the form of higher prices he said 
abrams said panasonic began fixing prices in march but stopped 
after six months when it learned of his investigation the company 
had planned to extend the scheme to include all its products he 
said 
panasonic coerced retailers into charging full list prices by 
threatening to stop supplying stores that sold its products for less 
than the suggested price he said 
the attorney general could not say how many retailers 
participated but said more retailers went along than opposed it 
abrams office learned of the scheme when an unidentified major 
retailer that does business in new york bitterly complained it 
was being pressured by panasonic to strictly comply with price 
guidelines he said 
under the agreement the retailers are not liable for any damages 
consumers who bought any of the products during the sixmonth 
period and sent in warranty cards will be notified they are eligible 
for a refund panasonic also agreed to publish newspaper 
advertisements on obtaining refunds abrams said 
refunds on the overcharges will range from 45 for video cameras 
to 17 for a cordless telephone 
under the agreement attorneys general in all states except 
hawaii where retailers deal with asianbased panasonic 
subsidiaries will have the option of adopting the settlement in 
their state abrams said illinois and maryland already have 
if attorneys general representing at least 80 percent of 
panasonic consumers nationwide fail to adopt the agreement within 60 
days either party can terminate the settlement 
if that happens abrams said new york would sue panasonic

practicality may have made the classic 
white nurses cap obsolete but a doctor with a love of the past 
brought them back for a day at delta medical centers emergency room 
i told the nurses one day that if they would wear their attire 
that nurses used to wear 10 15 20 years ago mainly the 
traditional nurses cap id dress up and buy them lunch emergency 
room physician david merideth said 
five nurses did so meredith ordered a seafood lunch brought into 
the emergency room last friday 
i didnt think theyd do that but they held me to it he 
said 
merideth shucked the scrub greens that have become standard among 
hospital medical staffs and put on whites complete with jacket and 
tie 
the nurses white uniforms included caps representing their 
nursing schools except for one who had to borrow a cap for the 
occasion 
we dont think its really practical to dress like this

ram chun survived being born in a thai 
refugee camp eight years ago and she survived the hostility 
cambodian immigrants faced in their wonderful new country but 
she didnt survive patrick purdy 
rams mother im chun spoke of her daughters difficult life and 
death as she stood in the doorway of her apartment with reddened 
eyes wednesday a day after purdy inexplicably killed ram and four 
other southeast asian children and wounded 30 people at the 
cleveland elementary school before taking his own life 
she said that all her family her brothers got killed in 
cambodia by communists said interpreter setha thach who 
translated for im chun she thought she came here to live 
peacefully but something like this happens even 1 million 
cant buy her child back that she lost 
wednesday evening more than 200 mourners gathered at a church 
next door to the school where they heard the lords prayer intoned 
in cambodian as thankful parents whose children survived the 
attack clung to their youngsters 
chance random fate and a very disturbed gunman have 
brought grief mourning and chaos to our city said the rev 
arnold vorster of central united methodist church 
especially do we weep for our southeast asian brothers and 
sisters for all children belong to the american family they 
are our wealth and our future for the bell tolls for us all 
earlier in the day many children stayed home from school despite 
the urging of psychologists and the efforts of workers who spent the 
night repairing bullet holes and removing blood stains from the 
school grounds 
my father said we couldnt go to school said fifthgrader 
sokchea thlang who added that her father had cried when he heard 
about the shootings three of his older children had died in 
cambodia and he feared sokchea her thirdgrader sister or 
kindergartener brother had been shot they were all uninjured 
i thought when we came to the states of america i thought we 
would have a wonderful life and everything was going to be 
exciting said sokchea 
at first she said she thought the gunfire was firecrackers 
then my teacher looked out the door and she saw a man and two 
girls lying on the ground she said my teacher started to cry 
everybody got under the tables and everybody started to cry 
for cambodian refugees who have settled locally the schoolyard 
massacre was particularly incomprehensible 
at an apartment complex about six blocks from the school young 
children peered through the windows and raced bicycles on tiny yards 
of compacted mud many of the women and girls wear colorful batik 
sarongs thongs are the most common footwear the teeth of some 
women are stained with beetlenut a plant popular as chewing gum 
among southeast asians 
i wonder why he wanted to kill fifthgrader och sao mused 
noting that all five victims were from southeast asian refugee 
families i think he hated cambodians or something 
och said many cambodian immigrants have met hostility in their 
new country 
down the street friends huddled around a space heater on woven 
mats under framed snapshots of another victim 6yearold sokhim an 
and her family the parents werent home the girls mother 
korning was hospitalized for shock after her daughter the eldest 
of three children was killed thach said 
they wonder why whats happening to the cambodians neighbor

super bowl glitz and glitter are a tonic for civic 
pride 
the week gives a city a chance to bask in the glare of 
international media attention 
the tonic of super bowl xxiii however is a bittersweet brew 
the concoction prepared and tested over the years by the national 
football league with the care of a master chef has been soured by a 
helping of ghetto violence 
oh the hype and hoopla are in full swing but they have been 
tempered by the sounds of gunshots and of rocks striking metal and 
glass and flesh 
a twisted ankle on a practice field is insignificant when 
newspaper headlines scream about violent death on streets not far 
from that field 
while the super bowl crowd guzzles cocktails molotov cocktails 
have flamed through the night in poor sections of this city which 
is no stranger to violent outbreaks 
tonight the huge media corps will be given a party by the miami 
super bowl xxiii host committee and it will be wined and dined 
friday by the nfl 
sixto mendez had stocked his meat market with 25000 worth of 
meat and other supplies in anticipation of parties over super bowl 
weekend 
wednesday he cleaned up what was left after the looting of the 
store in the overtown section where violence first flared after the 
fatal shooting of a black motorcyclist by a white policeman 
what has happened has shifted the emphasis from the super bowl 
to the community said dick anderson a former defensive back with 
the miami dolphins and a member of the citys the host committee 
the timing is so incredible considering all the time and energy 
these people have put into the game nfl commissioner pete rozelle 
said 
violence isnt programmed but in our society it has become the 
rule rather than the exception 
it was the third violent racial disturbance in overtown in six 
years 
people want answers to whats happening said cincinnati wide 
receiver eddie brown who grew up in overtown the big problem in 
the city is there is nothing to do for young people 
its a problem not unique to miami 
anderson felt that the situation began to change for better after 
numerous rrests tuesday night when violence spread to the liberty 
city and coconut grove areas 
since the police took the offensive and arrested looters 
things have calmed down he said 
anderson felt that attendance at the game at joe robbie stadium 
would not be affected 
i think the stadium has superb security anderson said 
if you know of anybody whos afraid to use their tickets ill 
buy them if theyre people who dont want to come im sure there 
are people in miami who would buy their tickets 
a ticket to a better life are what sixto mendez and others whose 
businesses and homes were destroyed would like 
the game will be played with all the usual fanfare and it will be 
watched by a zillion people on television 
the winners will parade through the streets of cincinnati or san 
francisco the television ratings will be seen by the nfl as the 
latest assurance of its high place on the american scene 
overtown liberty city and coconut grove will become footnotes 
three unwanted guests who at least for a time put a damper on 
americas biggest sporting party

many child molesters and sadists suffer 
subtle damage in the parts of the brain responsible for sexual 
fantasy possibly explaining the source of their abnormal urges a 
study suggests 
and a separate study of a rare kind of rapist found abnormalities 
in the part of the brain that allows conscience to control 
instinctive emotions the men were loners who committed their crimes 
during sudden brain seizures without anger or motive 
both studies were presented wednesday during a session on the 
biological roots of instinctive behavior at the annual meeting of 
the american association for the advancement of science 
they suggest that disorders in primitive circuits in the brain 
play a role in certain cases of abnormal sexual behavior said 
donald pfaff professor of neurology and behavior as rockefeller 
university in new york 
the first study of 400 men found abnormalities in the portions 
of temporal lobes the part of the brain near the ears in 40 
percent of the sadists and half the child molesters said ron 
langevin senior research psychologist at the university of 
torontos clarke institute of psychiatry 
langevin said the temporal lobes are involved in memories 
recognizing patterns and triggering sexual fantasies to arouse the 
limbic system the more primitive part of the brain that helps 
regulate emotions 
while the study suggests where does the unusual sexual behavior 
come from its never going to be a defense for accused child 
molesters or violent sex offenders because they still have a 
capability to recognize their urges and control them langevin said 
other factors including frequent alcohol and drug abuse and 
family upbringing can play a role in whether a person who has 
sadistic or pedophiliac impulses acts on them he added 
yet he acknowledged the impulses to sex crime must be powerful 
because so many offenders repeat their acts despite guilt therapy 
and a desire to change 
the other study by dr anneliese pontius a harvard university 
associate clnical professor of psychiatry dealt with two offenders 
who committed their crimes without premeditation feeling or anger 
and who remembered their acts despite hallucinations 
a teenager who tried to rape a 72yearold woman after he had a 
brain seizure when the womans gait reminded him of his mother who 
used to lock him in his room 
a father in his 20s who was charged with rape because while 
babysitting his sons playmate he suddenly performed oral sex on 
the 6yearold despite no history of pedophilia or homosexuality 
various neurological and brainimaging tests found abnormalities 
in both mens frontal lobes the third of the brain that is most 
evolved and plays a role in conceiving planning and executing an 
action and thinking about the consequences pontius said 
her theory is that in the two men the frontal lobes capability 
for conscience was defective and also overwhelmed by seizures in 
the limbic system where basic emotions are mediated 
the youth who attacked the woman suffered what pontius calls a 
limbic psychotic trigger reaction in which the sight of the old 
womans gait flooded his mind with a vivid memory of the repeated 
abuse by his mother 
the child rapist had limbic seizures from temporal lobe epilepsy 
which is much different than the common form of epilepsy he had a 
history of birth defects head injuries and seizures 
i got them through the court as not guilty by reason of 
insanity pontius emphasizing that very few sex offenders have 
such defects 
langevin detected the subtle stuctural abnormalities in molesters 
and sadists with cat scans of the brain patterns of brain 
electrical activity and neuropsychological tests to detect physical 
movements that correlate with brain injuries 
the study was complicated by the fact that onethird to half the 
sadists and pedophiles used alcohol or drugs which can cause brain 
damage and the sadists had a violent life style but langevin said 
he was able to distinguish such injury from the damage in the 
temporal lobes the cause of those abnormalities are unknown 
langevin said 
he defined the sadists as people who prefer to humiliate injure 
and sometimes kill others

an eastern airlines dc9 with 68 people aboard 
lost cabin pressure and was forced to drop 26000 feet the 
carriers second pressurization problem in a month 
flight 753 was traveling from cleveland to atlanta on wednesday 
when it was forced to go to a lower altitude over northeast georgia 
no injuries were reported said eastern spokeswoman karen ceremsak 
a sensor problem caused the plane to lose pressure the airline 
said 
the federal aviation administration and national transportation 
safety board were investigating the incident which followed the 
dec 26 emergency landing of an eastern boeing 727 in charleston 
wva that plane lost pressure after a 10by20inch hole opened in 
the fuselage there also were no major injuries in that incident 
the faa earlier this month directed airlines to step up 
inspections of the dc9 fleet which has an average age of 1818 
years the directive followed the agencys discovery of cracks in 
more than 20 planes during a special inspection 
eastern spokesman robin matell said wednesdays problem had 
little to do with the planes age a sensor apparently 
malfunctioned erroneously setting the pressure for a lower 
altitude he said 
the sensor in effect tells the plane what altitude its at and 
that sensor device apparently malfunctioned he said this is 
the type of thing that could happen on a plane one hour off the 
production line its simply a mechanical malfunction 
during the descent from 35000 to 9000 feet the oxygen masks 
dropped for the passengers

plo chairman yasser arafat today called 
for more confrontation in the 13month palestinian uprising to 
counter harsher tactics by israeli troops in the occupied west bank 
and gaza strip 
in a statement issued by the plo news agency wafa in nicosia 
arafat addressed the unified national command of the uprising 
and popular committees students in schools and universities and 
residents of refugee camps and towns and villages 
israel arafat said has escalated its iron fist policy to 
try to crush the rebellion forgetting that our people had decided 
from the beginning to continue the uprising until the end of the 
occupation 
so let us have more confrontation against the zionist 
occupation and the fascist hordes of murderous settlers 
in our steadfastness and faith the enemy faces its inevitable 
dilemma from which the way out is the retreat of its forces from 
the occupied lands arafat said 
during the uprising or intefadeh in arabic which began in 
december 1987 palestinians have attacked israeli soldiers and 
jewish settlers with stones and firebombs and in rare instances 
with guns and knives 
at least 362 palestinians and 15 israelis have been killed 
defense minister yitzhak rabin of israel on tuesday announced 
tougher measures to deal with the uprising including increasing the 
number of soldiers authorized to shoot at demonstrators and allowing 
soldiers to fire plastic or rubber bullets at stonethrowers as they 
flee 
israeli leaders have blamed the increase in violence in the 
occupied lands on the us decision last month to talk with the plo 
saying the opening of the dialogue encourages protesters because it 
makes them think their actions bring political gains 
the united states decided to open talks with the palestine 
liberation organization after arafat publicly renounced terrorism 
and acknowledged israels right to exist 
israel seized the west bank and gaza in the 1967 middle east war 
and 17 million palestinians uneasily share the territories with 
70000 jewish settlers

china his family reported he was 48 
despite suffering from the debilitating disease caused by a plant 
fungus that eventually confined him to a wheelchair chatwin 
recently completed his sixth book a collection of writings called 
what am i doing here 
it is to be published later this year 
in a 1987 interview chatwin said he contracted the ailment 
during a trip to western china dismissing the disease that killed 
him wednesday with the comment hazards of travel rather an 
alarming one 
his british agent gillon aitken said today he had been 
staying at a friends house became very ill and was taken to a 
hospital in nice where he died hed been ill for about three 
years with a viral disease from china and died from that 
the london newspaper the daily telegraph called him one of the 
most remarkable writers of the last dozen years in a relatively 
brief career as a writer he published five books three of them 
novels 
after becoming an expert on impressionist art chatwin gave up 
his job with a major auction house at age 24 to study anthropology 
and embark on the travels that inspired his books 
he based in patagonia on a trek through southern argentina 
and chile the viceroy of ouidah on west africa on the black 
hill on the welsh hills where he bought a house the songlines 
on travels in australia and his most recent utz on pragues 
art world 
a private man and spare writer he combined an obsession with 
nomadic peoples with elements of fiction and realism and an original 
method of composition compared by critics to film crosscutting and 
merging 
born in 1940 the son of a naval officer chatwins first years 
were restless as he and his mother followed his fathers minesweeper 
around britain 
he went to several boarding schools skipped college and joined 
sothebys auction house as a trainee within six years he was head 
of their impressionist department the youngest person to hold the 
post 
at 24 chatwin told an interviewer he left the house out of 
sheer boredom works of art are much tougher than those handling 
them who crumbled before your eyes 
he enrolled at edinburgh university to study anthropology and 
archaeology before embarking on his first travels in 1965 he 
married the american daughter of an admiral elizabeth chanler 
in patagonia was published in 1977 and followed his solitary 
journey through the southern tip of south america it brought him 
instant recognition as a writer 
the book based on his fascination with people there and their 
stories welded truth and imagination 
chatwin dubbed the technique searches an imaginative 
mixture of anthropology history biography and fiction the book 
won both the somerset maugham and em forster literary awards 
the viceroy of ouidah published in 1980 and set in 19th 
century west africa also showed his disregard for conventional 
methods of writing it won the whitbread literary award 
on the black hill set in rural wales followed in 1982 and 
was made into a movie of the same name in 1987 the songlines an 
expansive account of australian aboriginal creation myths was 
published in 1987 
utz a novel about the psychopathology of the compulsive art 
collector was published last week 
at that time he was quoted by the new york times book review as 
saying that for him travel had become a form of tyranny as you 
go along you literally collect places he said im fed up with 
going places i shant go to anymore 
fairhaired with good looks and a penetrating gaze chatwin once 
remarked in an interview what interested me most were the people 
who had escaped the archaeological record the nomads who trod 
lightly on the earth and didnt build pyramids 
insatiably curious about others chatwin refused to give personal 
details about himself for reference books and was rarely 
interviewed even a television program about him and his writing 
showed him as singularly unforthcoming 
he is survived by his wife

major technical obstacles block development 
of orbiting nuclear reactors that would be powerful enough for 
star wars weapons the national research council said as other 
scientists urged a ban on such devices 
the pentagon which requested the report called the reactors 
essential and said the document was unduly pessimistic 
one obstacle to the kinds of nuclear reactors now under 
consideration is they would be too heavy said the 140page report 
at these projected masses of hundreds of tons the 
feasibility of space power systems needed for highpower sdi 
concepts appears impractical from both cost and launch 
considerations the report said 
the report said a smaller and more powerful system is needed 
the united states has no working reactors in orbit but the 
government is developing one that by the mid1990s is to deliver 
between 10000 and 100000 watts of electricity still far short of 
whats needed to power the weapons 
the report said the power needed for sdi weapons would range from 
tens of millions to hundreds of millions of watts and beyond 
the conclusion of the panel was theres a lot of work that has 
to be done before a practical operating highpower system is 
feasible to provide electricity for star wars or strategic 
defense initiative weapons said joseph g gavin jr chairman of 
the council committee that wrote the report the council is part of 
the national academy of sciences 
gavin former president of grumman corp and the man responsible 
for designing and building the appollo lunar module released the 
report at a news conference wednesday during the annual meeting of 
the american association for the advancement of science 
col george hess technology director for the pentagons sdi 
office said the united states must build advanced space reactors 
because the nations future as a spacefaring nation in the next 
century depends on large amounts of power 
were developing a technology for which there is no historic 
precedent said richard l verga head of power development for 
the office we can do better than that report indicates were 
pretty bullish 
gavins report said the united states should design two 
substantially different power systems nuclear and chemical to 
determine if they would work for star wars it said existing 
concepts for such power plants do not adequately address questions 
of survivability reliability maintainability and operation

the gavin panel also urged the government to rereview the 
possibility of generating electricity on earth and beaming it to 
orbiting weapons platforms 
university of california santa cruz scientists daniel hirsch 
and joel primack reiterated a demand made last year by groups of 
us and soviet scientists to ban reactors within the earths orbit 
but permit reactors to power spacecraft headed for the moon or 
beyond 
such a ban would protect the planet from radioactive 
contamination when spacecraft fall to earth end disruption of 
satellite data and put an end to star wars they said 
primack a physicist said the soviets now have 33 reactors in 
orbit on radar satellites tracking us naval forces plus two 
powerful topaz reactors whose existence was revealed by soviet 
scientists at a meeting in new mexico this month 
hirsch who directs the universitys nuclear policy program said 
15 percent of all nuclearpowered spacecraft have suffered failures 
including the us snap9a plutonium unit that failed to reach orbit 
in 1964 and spread plutonium over the planet when it burned up in 
the atmosphere the soviet cosmos 954 reactor spread radioactive 
debris over a wide area of canada on reentry in 1978 
hess said the successful soviet effort to prevent the 
reactorpowered cosmos 1900 from falling to earth last year shows 
reactors can be operated safely

in three days last week the justice minister of 
this cautious conservative country resigned in shame a general was 
suspended for accepting a free trip and a prominent legislator was 
convicted of fraud 
last month the supreme court ruled that public funds were used 
illegally to affect the outcome of a regional election six years ago 
justice minister elisabeth kopps appointment in 1984 was 
enormously popular she became the first woman member of the swiss 
cabinet only 13 years after women gained the right to vote 
a week ago jan 11 a special prosecutor said mrs kopp was 
suspected of passing to her husband official secrets about an 
investigation of possible drugmoney laundering by a company of 
which he was a board member 
an unswiss scenario but it happened in switzerland the 
masscirculation newspaper sonntagsblick declared this is how far 
weve come 
neue zuercher zeitung a conservative paper close to the swiss 
establishment said a national crisis might have resulted if 
the fire had smoldered on 
the case of mrs kopp focuses attention on switzerlands role as 
international financial hub with the attendant risk of handling 
illegal money and womens roles in the nations politics 
she is accused of secretly warning her husband also a lawyer in 
october to cut his ties with a zurich company because it was being 
investigated 
hans w kopp gave up his post on the board of shakarchi trading 
ag a lebanesecontrolled company and prosecutors said a few days 
later the company may have been involved in switzerlands biggest 
moneylaundering case no charges have been filed and the company 
denied involvement 
after the first reports in december that her husband was tipped 
from inside the justice ministry mrs kopp said she would resign at 
the end of february 
then came the special prosecutors report last week showing she 
had concealed some facts and she quit the same day mrs kopp has 
insisted throughout however that she did no wrong 
her husband has had trouble before 
he was chairman of a financial services company that collapsed in 
1982 and was investigated for fraud and falsification of documents 
in 1971 he was temporarily suspended from the zurich bar 
association following allegations of improper conduct that never 
were officially explained 
a recent public opinion poll revealed concern among the swiss 
about ties between government and business of those responding 52 
percent said people who serve in parliament a parttime job in 
switzerland should not sit on company boards at the same time 
the justice minister always publicly defended her husband but 
sonntagsblick said elisabeth kopps conduct is not that of a 
perturbed loving wife it is that of a coolly calculating lawyer 
always admit only what can immediately be proven 
mrs kopps successor is expected to be a man but the swiss 
insist her fall will not affect opportunities for women in top 
political ranks 
neue zuercher zeitung said the events leading to the 
resignation are so singular that they do not permit general 
conclusions 
the military a cornerstone of swiss society was tarnished the 
same day the minister resigned by suspension of the air force chief 
of staff for letting a domestic aircraft manufacturer pay for a 
twoweek trip to australia 
officials said brig gen alfred ramseyer was under investigation 
for bribery he has reimbursed the company for the trip 
two days later on jan 13 a chief organizer of the 1987 alpine 
ski world championships in cransmontana resigned from parliament 
after a court sentenced him to two years probation for fraud 
hubert bonvin a leading politician in tourismoriented valais 
canton was convicted of bilking it of 20644 by taking a salary as 
vice president of the organizing committee while on paid sick leave 
from his job as a high school teacher 
while the kopp affair was developing the supreme court ordered a 
repeat of a 1983 referendum in the germanspeaking laufen district 
that kept it in bern canton or state instead of moving it into 
basel canton 
it said a secret payment of 210000 by the bern state government 
to a probern committee may have determined the outcome 
the laufen vote was an indirect result of a national referendum 
in 1978 that created frenchspeaking jura canton from territory in 
germanspeaking bern

us possesses tape of reported arafat threat 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
the state department says it has obtained a 
tape recording of yasser arafat the chairman of the palestine 
liberation organization threatening anyone who tries to stifle the 
uprising on the israeliheld west bank 
according to spokesman charles e redman the plo leader said 
last week whoever thinks of stopping the intefadah before it 
achieve its goals i will give him 10 bullets in the chest 
intefadah is the arabic word for the 13month uprising by 
palestinians against israels occupation of the west bank and gaza 
strip 
redman said wednesday that arafat has since denied he intended 
any threat against elias freij the mayor of bethlehem who is 
considered a moderate palestinian and was the purported target 
the us official gave no indication the united states was 
reconsidering its decision to hold talks with the plo the decision 
was taken last month after arafat made a statement renouncing 
terrorism in all forms and recognizing israels right to exist 
at the time richard w murphy the assistant secretary of state 
for the near east said the substantive dialogue would be broken 
off if arafat reneged on his pledge 
after arafats reported threat secretary of state george p 
shultz who had recommended the us talks with the plo said we 
will observe behavior as the process proceeds 
threats against people who try to move in a calmer and more 
peaceful direction are acts of intimidation and fall much more into 
the terrorism category shultz said 
at the same time redman criticized a reported decision by 
israeli defense minister yitzhak rabin to take tougher measures 
against palestinians who attacked soldiers on the west bank and in 
gaza 
he called the reports very disturbing if true 
on other subjects the state department deplored the 
proliferation of biological weapons capability and issued a new 
report slamming libya as a sponsor of terrorism 
citing intelligence sources redman said a number of nations were 
bent on developing this particularly horrible form of warfare 
william h webster the director of the central intelligence 
agency said in a speech last october that at least 10 countries 
were working to produce biological weapons 
it was understood iraq was one of the countries identified by 
us intelligence sources as having a biological weapons program 
however a us official who spoke on condition of anonymity said 
wednesday it is not 100 percent certain yet 
redman said he could not identify individual cases for 
security reasons 
meanwhile the departments office to counter terrorism reported 
that libya continued to support terrorism in 1988 despite a public 
posture of moderation 
the report libya unchanged said libya also had participated 
directly in at least one operation in senegal and that libyan 
operatives were active worldwide especially in africa latin 
america and the caribbean 
the abu nidal organization a palestinian group with its 
headquarters in libya has resumed terrorist operations with 
deadly consequences and several other groups supported by libya 
conducted terrorist operations against us and western targets the 
report said 
the united states bombed tripoli in april 1986 after linking 
libya to the bombing of a night club in west germany frequented by 
american servicemen subsequently the reagan administration said 
the attack had the effect of dampening col moammar gadhafis use of 
terrorism 
the new report said the libyan leader has eventually resumed 
his violent ways and that libya was squarely in the ranks of 
state sponsors of terrorism

burmese government troops backed by mortars 
captured a major rebel camp near the thaiburmese frontier sending 
600 civilians of the karen ethnic group fleeing to thailand thai 
officials said today 
about 900 soldiers of the burmese army seized the klerday camp 
wednesday night following a series of attacks on peripheral karen 
outposts officials said klerday is in burma opposite the thai 
district of tha song yang in tak 
the officials said hundreds of armed karens fled to areas 
southeast of the fallen camp where the guerrillas hoped to regroup 
at klerday burmese ground troops fired mortar shells and set 
ablaze 80 thatched homes according to rebels accounts 
from the thai side smoke was seen for miles some 10 hours after 
the incident a thai journalist at the border reported 
earlier wednesday government troops overran two small bases 
forcing a number of the karen rebels to retreat to klerday the 
karen national union fields 4000 guerrillas and is regarded as the 
strongest of a dozen ethnic rebel organizations fighting the rangoon 
government for greater autonomy 
a karen fighter later told the associated press that 700 
reinforcement units arrived too late at klerday he spoke on 
condition of anonymity 
mong chi 40 a karen civilian who crossed into thailand said 
these attacks by the burmese troops were the heaviest in years 
a thousand mortar shells crashed inside and around the camp 
forcing evacuations everywhere he said there was no refuge 
even in bunkers 
theng tun 27 said burmese troops overran the camp and then 
withdrew because they feared retaliation when darkness fell 
thai border patrol police who tried to prevent the 600 karens 
from entering thailand said they saw five karen teenagers with m16 
automatic rifles try to cross rapids in the moei river all five 
were feared drowned they said

side of the moei river which forms the boundary but will not let 
them move deeper into thailand tak is 230 miles northwest of

the engine and tile problems of the 
last space shuttle mission have been resolved and the discovery 
probably will be launched into orbit on feb 23 said the director 
of the kennedy space center 
we feel we have a good understanding of those problems and can 
move ahead forrest s mccartney told reporters wednesday 
atlantis returned from orbit last month with severe damage to 
about 200 of 28000 tiles that protect it from reentry heat and 
during postflight inspection two small cracks were found in a 
bearing unit in a highpressure engine turbopump 
the tile damage resulted when insulation hit the shuttle during 
liftoff after stripping away from both the external fuel tank and 
the nose cone of one of the solid fuel booster rockets mccartney 
said 
the fuel tank was the oldest one ever flown on a shuttle it had 
gone through some earlier test fueling cycles and some of its 
insulation had been repaired before flight he said 
we feel we dont have those problems with the next tank because 
we have better bonding which we have subjected to pull tests 
mccartney said 
the nose cone insulation has been strengthened he said 
engineers believe the bearing cracks were caused by stress 
corrosion apparently resulting from moisture that somehow got into 
the metal mccartney said 
he said the problem appears to be unique to atlantis turbopump 
and that inspection of discoverys turbopumps have cleared them for 
flight 
discovery is set to make the third shuttle flight since the 
explosion of challenger three years ago during five days in orbit 
the fiveman astronaut crew is to deploy a communications satellite 
conduct experiments and photograph damage that man and nature have 
caused to the earth

ante markovic former head of croatia 
and an ardent supporter of radical marketoriented reforms was 
nominated today as yugoslavias new premier the state tanjug news 
agency reported 
the nomination by the ninemember federal presidency must be 
formally approved by the countrys parliament at an upcoming session 
markovic 64 will succeed branko mikulic who together with his 
entire cabinet resigned dec 30 it was the first time since the 
ruling communists took power after world war ii that a federal 
government had stepped down 
mikulics government had failed to solve the countrys myriad 
social and economic ills including a 250 percent annual inflation 
rate and a 21 billion foreign debt even as markovic was nominated 
today prices increases were announced on more than 300 goods and 
services 
markovic an electrical engineer successfully managed two of 
yugoslavias largest engineering firms has often advocated radical 
marketoriented changes in the economy and demanded simultaneous 
reforms in its political system including a pluralism of ideas 
within the existing political structure 
a record nearly 1400 strikes were officially registered last 
year amid public calls for the introduction of a multiparty system 
as a solution to the protracted yugoslav crisis 
the yugoslav presidency decided in favor of markovic rather than 
borisav jovic a serb who was the only other official candidate for 
the post 
the decision is seen as an affront to serbias hardline communist 
party president slobodan milosevic jovic speaker of serbias 
parliament is a close political ally of milosevic 
serbia has claimed the post should go to its candidate since the 
largest of yugoslavias six republics has not had a premier in 22 
years 
the presidencys nomination of markovic also means reformist 
elements in the communist party have won a clear victory over more 
conservative and dogmatic factions 
the brief tanjug dispatch did not indicate how the vote in the 
ninemember presidency was conducted or thge margin of markovics 
victory before his nomination markovic enjoyed the support of 
yugoslavias liberal and developed northern republics of slovenia 
and croatia 
jovic was supported by the poorer and more conservative southern 
regions that fear radical marketoriented reforms could result in 
the closure of statesubsidized factories massive layoffs and 
further social unrest 
in yugoslavia the federal government is generally responsible 
for economic policy while the collective presidency which appoints 
the premier dictates defense and foreign policy 
but the bulk of political influence in the country is 
concentrated in the communist pparty with power dispersed in eight 
often fractious central committees reflecting the administrative 
division of the country into six republics and two autonomous 
provinces 
the government essentially follows guidelines set by the party 
bodies that must themselves hammer out a consensus before any 
policies can be implemented 
the government announced price increases today for 300 goods and 
services including a 30 percent boost in the price of gasoline and 
diesel fuel 
the national petroleum company attributed the increase to a 3662 
percent depreciation of the dinar against the us dollar since the 
last fuel price increase on nov 12 which makes foreign oil 
purchases more expensive 
yugoslav workers earn the equivalent of about 80 a month

foreign minister isidoro malmierca of cuba arrived 
in beijing tonight for the first visit of a cuban foreign minister 
to china 
earlier today the xinhua news agency reported that chinas 
foreign minister qian qichen has accepted an invitation to travel 
to cuba 
qian was quoted by xinhua as saying malmiercas visit to beijing 
would contribute significantly to chinesecuban ties 
malmierca arrived a day later than scheduled it was not clear 
why the visit had been delayed 
in an interview in bucharest romania qian said malmierca 
invited him to cuba and that he had accepted it would be his first 
visit to latin america no dates have been set 
china and cuba established diplomatic relations in 1960 but 
relations with cuba and the rest of the soviet bloc remained chilly 
for two decades due to chinas split with the soviet union 
when beijing and moscow began to improve ties in the early 1980s 
china and cuba started cultural and other nonpolitical exchanges a 
trade agreement was signed in 1985 
twoway trade jumped from 179 million in 1986 to 300 million in 
1988 xinhua reported prospects for further development are 
limited however because the economies of china and cuba are too 
similar both export large quantities of raw materials and are 
interested in importing high technology 
still a ministerial level meeting on trade and commerce was held 
recently in beijing bectween cuba and china qian said that meeting 
marked a new beginning for economic cooperation

people infected with the aids virus should 
correct bad dietary habits even before aids symptoms appear a 
nutrition task force says 
early corrective steps may slow weiht loss and avoid 
nutritional complications seen in fullblown aids the guidelines 
say 
diet alone cannot cure aids and scientists do not yet know 
whether proper nutrition truly affects the course of the disease 
cautioned myron winick chairman of the task force that produced the 
guidelines 
but experience with other conditions suggests it may help said 
winick professor of nutrition and pediatrics at the columbia 
university college of physicians and surgeons in new york 
we hope that the course of this disease can be a little better 
and that the quality of life can be improved if we pay attention to 
nutrition and we start paying attention right from the beginning 
he said in a recent interview 
the 11member task force included representatives from the 
national institutes of health universities and hospitals its 
guidelines on nutrition and aids were intended for health care 
personnel 
infected but symptomfree people should be assessed for 
nutritional deficiencies and counseled about the value of proper 
diet in aids the guidelines say the persons nutritional reserves 
can then be built up before they contend with the disease winick 
said 
people with aids may have mouth pain difficulty swallowing 
diarrhea nausea loss of appetite and other symptoms that interfere 
with proper nutrition but they can take steps to ease the problems 
the task force said 
for example avoiding foods that are spicy acidic or very hot or 
cold may help in avoiding mouth pain the task force said foods 
with a single texture are easier to swallow than others while 
eating with a friend in a pleasant atmosphere may encourage a 
flagging appetite 
the task force was financed with a grant from norwich eaton 
pharmaceuticals inc which makes a nutrition formula that can be 
used in aids patients with bowel troubles winick said

in a bid to protect the native language the tiny 
republic of estonia has decreed that all russians and other 
nonnatives who work in stores government or other service jobs 
learn estonian in four years 
the restive baltic republics legislature voted on wednesday by 
20450 with six abstentions to adopt the unprecedented law said 
felix undusk a commentator for staterun estonian television 
people who fail to comply will lose their jobs he said 
it was another pioneering move by estonias legislature which in 
november challenged the central government in moscow by declaring 
sovereignty over all but foreign affairs 
there was no immediate reaction from the kremlin to estonias 
latest action official soviet media reported on the new law but 
did not mention the sanctions against workers who do not learn 
estonian 
radio moscow said the republics supreme soviet adopted a law 
making estonian the official language but that the law points out 
that such a status does not infringe on the rights of people whose 
mother tongue is not estonian 
estonias standard of living enviably high by soviet standards 
has led to an influx of immigrants and many estonians fear they 
will one day be outnumbered in their own homeland 
about 65 percent of estonias population of 15 million is ethnic 
estonian russians make up 28 percent ukrainians 3 percent and 
byelorussians 2 percent 
this law means that if i go to the doctor or ask a policeman 
where the post office is i can get an answer in estonian undusk 
said in a telephone interview from tallinn the estonian capital 
for estonians this is important this is the only place in the 
world where our language is spoken 
undusk said there had been a great deal of immigration in past 
years and there are people who work in post offices medical 
clinics and factories who dont speak estonian and have never 
tried 
this law will change that by requiring them to learn the 
language if they dont after four years they will have to leave 
their jobs 
he said another provision of the law requires all goods sold in 
the republic to be labeled in estonian 
tass the official news agency said the law also requires that 
legal proceedings and records at estonian offices and factories be 
in estonian 
russian traditionally has been the common language among the more 
than 100 nationalities of the empire the bolsheviks captured from 
the czars 
many citizens of estonia an independent nation forcibly absorbed 
by the soviet union in 1940 with its neighbors latvia and lithuania 
refuse to learn russian or use it only when necessary 
undusk who attended wednesdays legislative session said the 
republic would finance estonianlanguage courses and print 
instruction manuals for ethnic russians or others who must learn the 
language 
most government documents in estonia were written in russian 
until 1987 and the republics former communist party chief knew 
little estonian he was replaced last summer by a reformer and a 
native of the republic vaino vyalyas 
a constitutional amendment passed last month made estonian the 
official language but legislators postponed a vote on requiring 
foreigners to learn it 
when estonia declared sovereignty in november the presidium of 
the supreme soviet in moscow the nations top executive body 
declared the action illegal but estonian lawmakers say their own 
constitution outranks presidium decrees

a new kind of surgery can correct a 
common heart rhythm abnormality that is the underlying cause of 
225000 disabling strokes in the united states each year its 
developer said 
the experimental procedure cures a disorder known as atrial 
fibrillation which affects an estimated 15 million to 2 million 
americans 
although the strokes that result from this problem can sometimes 
be prevented with bloodthinning drugs that treatment is often 
ineffective and may itself cause unwanted bleeding 
the new technique was developed by dr james l cox of washington 
university school of medicine who described it wednesday at a 
meeting of the american heart association slices are made in the 
atria the two upper pumping chambers of the heart 
cox has performed the operation so far on three people and all 
of them have been completely free of the disorder since their 
surgery however more work will be necessary before doctors can 
estimate how widely the operation will be used 
i think we have a definitive treatment for people with atrial 
fibrillation said cox 
its a remarkable step forward commented dr myron l 
weisfeldt of johns hopkins university who is presidentelect of the 
association 
the surgery corrects chaotic beating fibrillation of the 
atria during fibrillation the chambers stop orderly beating and 
this disrupts the flow of blood through the heart 
as a result blood tends to form clots inside the left atrium 
and these sometimes break off and flow into the brain there they 
can plug arteries and shut off the flow of blood causing strokes 
to combat the problem doctors often give anticoagulants which 
slow the bodys natural tendency to form blood clots 
however dr louis r caplan of new england medical center in 
boston said that doctors suspect this treatment may do more harm 
than good 
its a huge problem said caplan a stroke expert the 
question is which if any patient should have anticoagulants and 
which if any should have this procedure 
during the 45minute surgery doctors make four slices in the 
atria this keeps the electrical signal that regulates the heart 
beat flowing across the heart muscle in just one direction so it 
doesnt become chaotic 
this operation proves that you can deal with the problem of 
chaotic traffic inside the heart by creating oneway streets 
said weisfeldt 
cox said it is still unclear how many of the 225000 potential 
annual victims of strokes resulting from atrial fibrillation might 
be treated with the new operation he said it is most likely to be 
used in patients who are already undergoing heart surgery for other 
problems 
he said he has been cautious in expanding the operation which 
was first developed experimentally in dogs but he said there is a 
waiting list of 14 patients who want to receive it at his hospital 
cox said one goal will be to find ways to reduce the time it 
takes to perform the operation perhaps by using using lasers 
instead of ordinary surgical knives

an offshore quake jolted southern california 
shattering windows in ritzy malibu briefly knocking out power to 
100000 customers and reverberating with dozens of aftershocks today 
no major damage was reported from wednesdays temblor which 
measured 50 on the richter scale and was centered 30 miles 
southwest of downtown los angeles in santa monica bay the quake 
swayed downtown skyscrapers 
its the strongest earthquake ive felt in 14 years of living 
in los angeles said rick cziment of los angeles it actually 
scared me our house went dark my daughter woke up and began 
crying 
firefighters in manhattan beach attributed one injury to the 
1054 pm quake when a woman fell on her nose no other injuries 
were reported 
at this point it looks like we got off pretty well said 
michael gurein spokesman for the state office of emergency services 
rubble from about a dozen rock slides blew out tires on at least 
four vehicles traveling the narrow twisting malibu canyon road that 
leads to the swank malibu beach colony 30 miles southwest of los 
angeles said sheriffs sgt bill hutton the road remained open 
the quake could be felt from seal beach to santa barbara a 
distance of 140 miles 
windows along the coast shattered including a department store 
plate glass window in malibu 
but most of the damage was to the nerves of humans and animals 
alike cory ford of whittier said the quake rattled her cat 
moments before the quake our cat jasmine started running 
around in circles her tail stood straight up her fur out like 
electricity said ford then came a sudden hard jolt for a few 
seconds then a rolling shake all for about 8 or 10 seconds though 
it seemed longer 
dozens of tiny aftershocks continued to vibrate throughout the 
area today most of them too small to measure said lucile jones 
seismologist at the california institute of technology 
the quake briefly knocked out power to nearly 100000 dwellings 
and businesses across los angeles the citys department of water 
and power reported 
wednesdays quake struck with the same magnitude of a dec 3 
temblor that was centered beneath downtown pasadena that quake 
briefly knocked out power to 100000 homes and caused more than two 
dozen minor injuries 
the whittier narrows quake of oct 1 1987 measured 59 on the 
richter scale that quake and its 53magnitude aftershock on oct 4 
killed eight people injured more than 200 others and caused 358 
million in damage 
the richter scale is a gauge of the energy released by an 
earthquake as measured by the ground motion recorded on a 
seismograph every increase of one number means a tenfold increase 
in magnitude 
an earthquake of 5 on the richter scale can cause considerable 
damage

an outbreak of lyme disease that struck onethird 
of the people who lived near a massachusetts wildlife preserve could 
happen anyplace in the northern united states where deer are 
plentiful researchers say 
in a study released today doctors found that the disease spread 
explosively near the preserve in ipswich mass after the deer herd 
became infested with bacteriacarrying ticks 
this appears to be a model for what might happen in other 
locations in which the abundance of deer is undergoing a rapid 
increase said dr andrew spielman of the harvard school of public 
health 
lyme disease is a potentially serious illness that can cause a 
variety of seemingly unrelated symptoms including a rash 
headaches facial paralysis heart complications and arthritis 
however it can be cured if treated early with penicillin 
about 1500 cases were reported last year to the us centers for 
disease control but officials estimate that the true total is 
probably five times that the disease is spread by ticks that feed 
on the blood of whitetailed deer and field mice but also will bite 
humans 
in the new study doctors recorded the spread of the disease 
among 190 people who lived along one road that connected the town of 
ipswich with the crane memorial reservation and wildlife refuge the 
1400acre oceanside nature preserve was already a haven for deer 
before the outbreak began in about 1980 
there were a lot of deer there and once the ticks had arrived 
the transmission was really explosive said dr catherine c 
lastavica it was very intense in a short period of time 
the epidemic peaked in 1984 and 1985 athough people there 
continue to catch lyme disease experts believe that insecticides 
limited deer hunting in the reserve and increased awareness of ticks 
have helped diminish the disease 
altogether 35 percent of the areas residents got the disease 
between 1980 and the end of 1987 among those living closest to the 
wildlife preserve the attack rate was 66 percent the researchers 
found 
the study conducted principally by lastavica of tufts university 
school of medicine was published in the new england journal of 
medicine 
the researchers said that until now the most intense reported 
outbreak was on great island off west yarmouth on cape cod between 
1979 and 1983 there 16 percent of 162 summer residents got the 
disease 
spielman said the disease has the potential to be widespread 
anyplace north of the masondixon line that has deer in the south 
he said the disease probably will remain uncommon perhaps because 
ticks there feed on lizards which are poor reservoirs for the bugs 
lyme disease has been seen in 34 states but is most common in 
new england the midatlantic states minnesota wisconsin and 
california 
the disease was first recognized by dr allen steere now of new 
england medical center in old lyme conn steere published a report 
on lyme disease in 1976 and gave the illness its name

an israeli soldier shot a palestinian teenager 
to death today as the youth urged on stonethrowers at a refugee 
camp in the occupied gaza strip the army and arab reports said 
twentyone palestinians were reported wounded in scattered 
clashes with israeli troops in the gaza strip and occupied west 
bank including 10 who were shot after attacking the home of an 
alleged palestinian collaborator 
the violence came as west bank residents staged a general strike 
to protest an upsurge in palestinian deaths fourteen arab youths 
have been killed in clashes with the army in the past week 
the strike order came two days after the army instituted a 
tougher policy that allows soldiers to fire plastic and rubber 
bullets more freely and provides for harsher punishment for 
stonethrowers 
the military government also closed 84 of the west banks 1200 
schools today in an effort to block violent protests the schools 
were shut down for periods of three days to four weeks 
in the gaza strips shati refugee camp a soldier shot 
18yearold mohammed dahaise after he was identified as an 
inciter of a stonethrowing attack on troops said an army 
spokeswoman 
she said dahaise who was from nearby gaza city was killed 
instantly arab hospital officials said he was shot in the head 
his death brought to 363 the number of palestinians killed since 
the uprising against israeli occupation of the west bank and gaza 
began in december 1987 fifteen israelis also have died 
in the west bank village of arraba residents stoned the home of 
a man suspected of collaborating with israeli authorities arab 
witnesses said the man emerged from his home with a pistol and shot 
four of the stonethrowers the witnesses said 
palestinians in the occupied lands are barred from bearing 
firearms but those cooperating with the authorities often are 
issued weapons for selfprotection 
after the stoning attack israeli troops arrived and opened fire 
wounding six villagers including a 10yearold boy who was in 
critical condition with a bullet in the head hospital officials 
said 
the army spokeswoman confirmed the account but said without 
elaborating that several villagers were wounded 
the strike in the west bank accompanying one already under way 
in the gaza strip was called wednesday by the plobacked unified 
leadership of the uprising but word of the strike spread slowly and 
it was not fully observed until today 
israeli reports said leaflets calling for the shutdown were 
circulated but palestinians in the west bank said they saw none and 
only heard of the strike on arablanguage radio from abroad or by 
word of mouth 
some merchants in the west bank town of bethlehem opened their 
shops today at 8 am as usual and only shuttered their doors 
after neighbors told them about the strike 
hundreds of students walked to school but turned back after 
hearing about the strike arab reporters said 
in nablus the west banks largest and most militant city 
students headed for school were turned back by palestinian youths 
whose faces were covered by keffiyehs the checked arab scarves that 
have become a symbol of the uprising

a dozen people occupied a regional 
immigration office for nearly five hours today to protest the arrest 
of a sri lankan man who sought refuge in a church to avoid being 
deported 
merseyside police inspector bill dugdale said the protesters 
entered the immigration office in this northern england port city 
this morning chained and padlocked the main door to keep out staff 
then ended their protest 
they never got past the foyer and we had been intent on doing 
nothing dugdale said they either got fed up or they think 
theyve achieved their objective they left the premises of their 
own free will 
the protesters caused no damage and none of them was arrested he 
said 
on wednesday police smashed their way into a church vestry in 
manchester 30 miles from liverpool and dragged away sri lnakan 
activist viraj mendis 32 
mendis who moved into the church after being issued a deporation 
order in 1986 says he fears persecution or death if returned to his 
indian ocean homeland which is wracked by ethnic violence between 
guerrillas of the majority sinhalese and the minority tamil 
populations 
he was taken to a london prison to await deportation friday his 
lawyer david burgess said he would appeal the deportation in the 
high court 
he was surprisingly spirited but he must be very apprehensive 
about what will happen burgess told reporters after visiting 
mendis in the hospital wing of pentonville prison 
the government said mendis would be sent home unless a third 
country accepted him home office minister timothy renton said on 
wednesday that mendis had no wellfounded case of persecution in 
sri lanka 
mendis who is sinhalese claims his life is threatened by his 
political activism in favor of communism and the tamil minority 
his removal from the church caused an outcry from his supporters 
who said the action violated his ancient right to sanctuary in a 
church 
under english common law a person accused of committing a crime 
could take sanctuary in a church but had to surrender or leave the 
country in 40 days this right was abolished in 1623 but mendis 
supporters chose the ancient right as his last resort to stay in 
britain

as an inquiry opened today into the 
worlds worst oilfield disaster occidental petroleum corp said 
sabotage was discovered on the piper alpha rig a year before it was 
destroyed by a fire 
some of the victims relatives protested at the opening day of 
the hearing demanding more searches for unrecovered bodies 
the north sea rig owned by the us company and a consortium of 
british partners was swept by explosions and fire on july 6 that 
killed 167 men the bodies of 31 have not been recovered 
ball bearings were found in one of the gas compressors 
occidental spokesman alex blakemilton told britains independent 
radio news in an interview today lord douglas cullen and the 
department of energy are both aware and so it may well be raised at 
the inquiry 
cullen the scottish judge leading the inquiry today dismissed a 
union leaders claim the hearing would be restricted to narrow 
technical questions he said it would deal with all evidence which 
has a tenable connection with what occurred 
the government has asked cullen to establish the cause of the 
disaster and recommend ways of preventing a similar disaster from 
occurring 
gavin cleland 60 whose 33yearold son robert was killed 
unfurled a banner outside the inquiry center in the scottish oil 
port city of aberdeen calling on the government to bring the men 
up now who are believed entombed by 12500 tons of debris in the 
waters 120 miles off the coast 
i will demonstrate until they clear the sea of piper alpha 
cleland told reporters 
blakemilton said the sabotage attempt was discovered in 
september 1987 the ball bearings were found and removed without 
incident 
the british broadcasting corp said the ball bearings were found 
in the same area in which the explosions occurred in july 
occidental which operated the piper alpha platform said the 
ball bearings were placed in a gas compression valve while it was 
temporarily out of service and were found when it was brought back 
into commission 
the bbc quoted an unidentified occidental spokesman as saying the 
bearings could have caused serious damage but not necessarily an 
explosion 
the sabotage attempt had earlier been disclosed by john wood one 
of the 62 survivors of the disaster in july 
the department of energy has said the disaster was not caused by 
sabotage it said in a preliminary technical report that a buildup 
of gas following a leak in the control module was thought to have 
been the cause 
todays inquiry attended by survivors rescuers technical 
experts lawyers reporters and observers is being held at this oil 
port city in northeast scotland and is expected to last at least six 
months 
in the disaster the blazing production platform lit up the night 
sky for 20 miles the gasfed fires raged on sporadically until 
leaking and burning wells were brought under control 23 days later 
the search for bodies was called off last month and occidental 
says further searches could endanger divers occidental plans to 
demolish the remains of the wrecked rig next month severing the 
upper half with explosives so it topples to the sea bed 
margo gordon whose husband james is among the missing said i 
could understand and accept better if there were just one or two 
bodies still missing but 31 is a lot of men too many to leave it 
be and allow the families to be written off

the soviet union has purchased 13 love letters 
written by poet alexander pushkin in a transaction that fulfilled a 
lifelong dream of the late russianborn choreographer serge lifar 
the yellowed letters in pushkins flowing handwriting were 
handed over wednesday night in a brief ceremony at a geneva hotel to 
yuri m khilchevsky the deputy soviet minister of culture described 
the acquisition of the letters by russias greatest and most honored 
poet as a festive event 
all but two of the letters are in french and addressed to natalya 
goncharova before pushkin married her in 1831 after a turbulent 
courtship and against the will of her mother 
once owned by a member of the czars family grand duke mikhail 
they were acquired by sergei diaghilev the famous impresario who 
died in 1929 and eventually were obtained by lifar the executor of 
diaghilevs will 
the soviet ministry of culture paid an undisclosed price for the 
letters in a private deal negotiated through sothebys the auction 
house the money will help fund the serge lifar prize awarded 
annually to talented dancers 
khilchevsky alluding to the policy of perestroika launched by 
soviet president mikhail s gorbachev said a new political 
mentality had humanized relations people he said 
increasingly valued the pure source of pushkins works which he 
termed a symbol of russian culture 
the letters tell in dramatic prose of pushkins love for natalya 
who was separated from him for months because of a quarantine 
imposed on moscow residents during a major outbreak of cholera in 
the summer of 1830 
many are pierced with a pin apparently in the belief this would 
kill the dreaded disease experts said one letter that was read 
aloud revealed his feelings for natalya and his fear that her mother 
would prevent their marriage 
maybe she is right and i am wrong in believing that happiness 
would be mine but in any case you are absolutely free to decide 
as for myself i give you my word of honor that i will either belong 
to you or never marry 
pushkin died in 1837 at age 38 from injuries received defending 
his wifes honor in a duel with his brotherinlaw 
the letters will become part of the pushkin museum in leningrad 
the former st petersburg where the author of boris godunov and 
eugen onegin settled after his marriage 
lifar who left russia as a refugee settled in france in the 
1920s where he revolutionized french ballet he died of cancer dec 
15 1986 at 81 in lausanne after moving to switzerland in 1981 with 
his companion of three decades countess lillan ahlefeldt of sweden 
she attended the ceremony wednesday night and told reporters 
lifar hoped throughout his life the letters would return to the 
country where he was born she said he had many offers from other 
countries including the united states but refused them all despite 
being in dire financial straits 
instead of selling the letters he would eat biscuits or take 
the metro subway she told reporters his hopes were raised by 
several visitors from the soviet union they kept telling him you 
will hear from us but they left him waiting till his death 
he was already dying when they promised him that if the letters 
would come back they would perform his famous classical ballets 
she said 
even on the morning of the day he died he said to me go down to 
the concierge and ask if there is not a letter from moscow there 
wasnt

soviet foreign minister eduard 
shevardnadze said today the soviet union will withdraw some of its 
shortrange nuclear missiles from eastern europe 
shevardnadze said a security and human rights accord approved 
sunday by 35 nations attending a vienna meeting made the move 
possible he said the missiles will be pulled out along with troops 
being withdrawn from eastern europe 
soviet president mikhail s gorbachev announced in december that 
50000 red army troops would be pulled out of eastern europe over 
the next two years but he made no mention of planned missile 
withdrawals 
shevardnadze made the announcement to foreign ministers at the 
conclusion today of the conference on security and human rights in 
europe 
stephen ledogar the us ambassador to new arms talks scheduled 
to open in vienna in march described shevardnadzes speech as 
upbeat and in general an encouraging sign for relations between 
nato and the warsaw pact 
in brussels nato spokesman robin stafford said if this 
signals that the soviets are now beginning to realize that their 
potential far exceeds legitimate requirements we can only find such 
steps encouraging 
but stafford added certainly questions must be answered which 
systems will be removed how many to where and what happens to 
them then in any event soviet superiority seems certain to remain 
for some time 
saying that truth must be visible shevardnadze said the 
soviet union should publish by the end of the month a detailed 
schedule of its armed forces reductions 
he said the soviet union has long offered to negotiate removal of 
its shortrange nuclear weapons and promised to withdraw them from 
europe as part of the kremlins fundamental objective of removing 
any foreign military presence and bases from the territory of other 
countries 
shortrange missiles also known as tactical or battlefield 
weapons have a range up to 300 miles and are not covered in the 
1987 arms accord signed by president reagan and gorbachev that 
agreement was to eliminate intermediaterange nuclear weapons with 
a range up to 1500 miles 
in a brief exchange with reporters after his speech shevardnadze 
made clear that only those shortrange weapons attached to military 
units being withdrawn from eastern europe will be removed and 
dismantled without conditions 
shevardnadze said he could not say what percentage of the 
kremlins shortrange stockpile would remain deployed he called on 
the west to negotiate removal of the remaining missiles as soon as 
possible 
ledogar repeated the us position that negotiations on the 
remaining shortrange missiles should be set only when some progress 
has been made toward balancing the two sides conventional forces 
such as tanks and artillery 
we dont want to abandon the nuclear leg of the deterrent until 
we have a much better situation on conventional forces ledogar 
told the associated press 
nato believes the warsaw pact has a substantial edge in 
conventional weapons 
referring to recent nato statements that modernization of the 
wests shortrange nuclear missiles is possible shevardnadze said 
the kremlin regards those plans as a step backward in arms 
control 
shevardnadze said the kremlin foresees a summit meeting of the 
leaders of all 35 countries participating in the vienna meeting as 
necessary 
on sunday the nations approved an accord that includes agreement 
on a new round of arms talks to reduce conventional weapons and 
troops across europe those talks are to begin in vienna on march 9 
the accord also put forth a sweeping definition of human rights 
to be protected including freer travel and religious practice 
environmental protection and economic cooperation 
in his wideranging speech today shevardnadze paid tribute to 
his departing american counterpart secretary of state george 
shultz but he criticized comments made by shultz and other western 
foreign ministers as faultfinding full of accusations and 
hazardous to the general spirit of trust and cooperation embodied in 
the vienna accord 
shevardnadze praised the accord as an achievement born of 
cooperation and an indication of hope for the future 
the vienna meeting has shaken up the iron curtain weakened its 
rusty support made new breaches in it and hastened its corrosion 
shevardnadze said 
also today italian foreign minister giulio andreotti announced 
that gorbachev will make an official visit to italy in november 
no soviet communist party chief has ever visited italy and 
analysts said the visit could set the stage for a historic meeting 
with pope john paul ii the vatican has always said the pope would 
be open to such a meeting

a man has been ordered to stand trial 
on charges he masterminded the killing of his wife at the hands of 
his teenage daughter and then urged the girl to take blame for the 
murder 
david a brown 36 was scheduled to be arraigned on murder 
charges feb 2 in superior court in santa ana in the 1985 shooting 
death of linda brown 23 the defendants fourth wife 
brown a computer programmer is accused of ordering his 
then14yearold daughter cinnamon brown to kill his wife 
cinnamons stepmother so he could collect on his wifes life 
insurance policy and be free to marry his wifes livein sister 
cinnamon brown who had spent three years in a juvenile facility 
after she was convicted of murder told investigators recently that 
her father was behind the murder authorities said 
after a threeweek preliminary hearing municipal court judge 
floyd h schenk ruled wednesday there was sufficient evidence to 
bind brown over for trial brown was held without bail in orange 
county jail 
schenk also found there was enough evidence to support a special 
allegation of murder for profit which means that brown could face 
the death penalty if convicted 
brown admitted he told his daughter to take the blame for his 
wifes killing and showed cinnamon how to write a suicide note and 
fake her own death after the slaying a videotaped interview shows 
but the tape also shows that brown told investigators after his 
arrest in september that he thought talk of a plot to kill his wife 
was a joke and couldnt believe the girl and his sisterinlaw 
were serious about the killing

soviet president mikhail s gorbachev will 
visit italy in november but he probably wont meet with pope john 
paul ii italian officials said today 
gorbachevs plan to visit italy was announced by italian foreign 
minister giulio andreotti after he met with his counterpart eduard 
shevardnadze 
the two were attending the 35nation helsinki review conference 
the announcement immediately raised speculation gorbachev might 
see the polishborn pontiff but vieri traxler the italian envoy to 
the international helsinki review conference told the associated 
press he did not know of any plans for gorbachev to see the pope 
during the visit to italy it would be surprising if gorbachev did 
meet with the pope said traxler 
relations between the vatican and the soviet union have been 
warming in recent months soviet officials participated last year in 
official ceremonies marking the 1000th year of russian christendom 
in previous meetings the vatican told soviet officials the pope 
would be open to a meeting with the soviet leader however after 
gorbachev met with vatican officials in moscow in june he said much 
must still happen before the pope can visit the soviet union which 
is officially atheist 
soviet officials in moscow reviewed gorbachevs schedule and said 
he could go to italy in the second half of november according to 
traxler

the state mental health commissioner has 
launched an investigation of all staterun child psychiatric centers 
in new york in the wake of a report that children at one facility 
operated a sex ring 
the children mostly between the ages of 5 and 12 had sex with 
each other and staff members at the facility over a sevenmonth 
period last year while administrators looked the other way 
according to a state report obtained by the associated press on 
wednesday 
the report by the state commission of quality of care for the 
mentally disabled focused on the western new york childrens 
psychiatric center in west seneca near buffalo 
patients there allegedly operated an informal club that required 
members to engage in oral and anal sex as an initiation rite 
the events at the western new york childrens psychiatric 
center were intolerable and would not be condoned there or elsewhere 
in the system said the mental health commissioner richard 
surles he said he felt a sense of moral outrage reading the 
report 
surles said his department has already investigated half of the 
states psychiatric centers and found no other such instances 
the report blamed inadequate supervision by staff members for 
encouraging the activity investigators said administrators 
virtually ignored the fact that more than half of the children 
involved had past histories of sexual abuse 
the 62bed psychiatric center houses children aged 5 to 18 who 
are either committed or enter voluntarily for a full range of 
psychiatric illnesses the club was confined primarily to a unit 
where 5 to 12yearolds were housed 
the commission investigated 32 child abuse complaints involving 
36 children that were filed between march and october 1988 the 
report said 23 of the cases involved sexual activity 15 of them 
among the children and the rest between children and staff 
the children were allegedly involved in vaginal and anal 
intercourse oral sex and fondling the report said 
most allegations indicated that the behavior was consensual 
the report said several however carried the implication that 
force intimidation or coercion was present 
the facilitys executive director cecile davis resigned several 
weeks ago said robert spoor spokesman for the mental health 
department he said there has been one other resignation among staff 
at the center and several have been disciplined 
four of the eight allegations involving sex between staff and 
children proved to be unsubstantiated spoor said one staff member 
has been convicted of child abuse and investigations are continuing 
that involve two other employees he added 
according to the commission report patients at the center once 
engaged in oral sex in a van at a time when two employees were 
present children told investigators that in some instances their 
sexual activity was made easier because staff members were sleeping 
on duty or alarm devices had been turned off 
several staff members allegedly knew about the sex club 
alternately called by such names as the toy club or 
transformer club but didnt investigate the report said 
many of the reported incidents of sexual activity among 
children at the facility appear to have occurred or persisted due to 
inadequate supervision of the children by staff the commission 
said 
the commission said it was tempted to blame everyone at the 
hospital but concluded that the director was ultimately responsible 
although virtually every incident was reported to the director 
both in writing and verbally there is little evidence of active 
intervention on behalf of the children involved the report said

the senate foreign relations committee giving 
an early boost to the incoming bush administration voted 190 today 
to recommend that the full senate confirm james a baker iii as 
secretary of state 
the full senate will act on the nomination later probably next 
wednesday 
todays committee vote followed two days of hearings in which 
baker fielded questions on problem areas around the world and dealt 
comfortably with foreign policy issues ranging from the momentous to 
the obscure 
virtually every member of the committee praised bakers 
performance applauded his appointment by bush and said his 
confirmation was assured 
sen paul sarbanes dmd said he is optimistic baker will prove 
an outstanding secretary of state combining diplomacy restraint 
and carefulness 
sen frank murkowski rala said the unanimous committee vote 
represents a strong bipartisan approach to the new administration 
this is a pretty good way to start he said 
he is very skillful as he should be and im impressed said 
sen nancy kassebaum rkan expressing a view many other committee 
members said they shared 
on wednesday the second of two days of testimony baker said the 
united states and the soviet union are near agreement on procedures 
to verify compliance with two longpending nuclear test ban treaties 
baker said he understands that verification problems with the 
1976 peaceful nuclear explosions treaty are completely resolved 
he said similar problems with the 1974 nuclear test ban treaty 
establishing a limit of 150 kilotons on underground tests are 
close to being resolved 
he said both pacts will be submitted to the senate for 
ratification but offered no timetable 
baker also suggested that the new bush administration may raise 
quotas for refugees because of the increasing numbers of people 
wanting to come to the united states from the soviet union and 
southeast asia 
we will have to look at the possibility of increasing numbers 
and of increasing dollars for the refugee program baker said 
baker said he has reservations about us participation in a 
scheduled 1991 international human rights conference in moscow but 
he added we made a commitment and we plan to keep it so long as 
conditions for improvements in soviet human rights performance are 
met 
he declined to choose from a trio of scenarios offered to explain 
why soviet president mikhail s gorbachev is making radical changes 
in domestic foreign and defense policy 
the jury is still out baker said thats why we should 
approach our relationship with prudence and a certain degree of 
realism 
as he left the hearing room baker expressed thanks to senators 
for scheduling the early start confirmation hearings even before 
presidentelect bush takes office 
it will mean i will be able to hit the ground with a running 
start instead of just hitting the ground baker said

complained that he felt like a caged animal in jail and said he 
didnt want to hear about the widespread calls for his execution

emotional and analytical in a series of tape recordings subpoenaed 
by florida attorney general bob butterworth in his attempts to prove 
bundy sane and ready for the electric chair 
bundy is scheduled for execution tuesday in the 1978 death of

i wouldnt really say i am despondent he said but clearly i 
am extraordinarily disappointed

lawyers for a man accused of killing his 
illegally adopted daughter accused his former livein lover today of 
causing the injuries because she considered the 6yearold girl a 
rival 
she didnt care about the kid a bit not one bit adrian 
diluzio an attorney for joel steinberg said in a closing statement 
to the jury he also called hedda nussbaum a poor excuse for a 
woman and a mother 
lisa steinberg was a rival diluzio said in state court in 
manhattan lisa got all the attention she nussbaum thought she 
should have been getting 
steinberg 47 is accused of beating lisa steinberg to death 
lisa whom steinberg illegally obtained at birth was removed 
unconscious from steinbergs apartment on nov 2 1987 she died of 
a brain injury three days later steinberg a disbarred criminal 
lawyer is charged with seconddegree murder 
the prosecution has argued that steinberg severely beat the girl 
then acted with reckless and depraved indifference to her life by 
letting her lie unconscious on the bathroom floor for 12 hours 
without seeking help 
defense attorney ira london blames the girls death on the 
prosecutions chief witness ms nussbaum 46 steinbergs former 
livein companion of 12 years 
london argues that ms nussbaum who testified steinberg told her 
he struck lisa and she didnt want to get up was jealous of the 
relationship between steinberg and lisa giving her a motive to 
fatally injure the child 
ms nussbaum reached a deal with prosecutors in which similar 
charges brought against her were dropped in exchange for her 
testimony 
during closing arguments london planned to review and interpret 
the bulk of the case for the defense while most of the medical 
testimony was to be summarized and analyzed by diluzio 
the prosecution presented a case that was almost entirely 
circumstantial with no eyewitnesses and no direct physical evidence 
that steinberg killed lisa 
assistant district attorney peter casolaro was to present the 
prosecutions closing arguments

a cardiologist testified today that he was 
shocked by the physical condition of former philippines president 
ferdinand marcos when he examined him earlier this week at a 
honolulu hospital 
he was unable to complete a sentence without stopping and 
gasping dr robert eliot told a federal judge who will determine 
if marcos is physically fit to stand trial on charges he stole 
millions of dollars from his country 
eliot who went to hawaii to give marcos a stress test said 
marcos was suffering from heart failure and kidney problems 
to make a long story short i felt this was a dying man said 
eliot who did consulting work on stress for nasa in the late 1960s 
the comments were made in a hearing before us district judge john 
f keenan 
on wednesday assistant us attorney charles labella said 
prosecutors were convinced for the first time that the 
71yearold marcos was too ill to travel here for arraignment 
however labella said the prosecution hoped for a speedy arraignment 
in honolulu and would not drop charges against marcos 
marcos living in exile in honolulu since 1986 has been 
hospitalized there since sunday with pneumonia and bronchial asthma 
st francis medical center spokeswoman norma kop said marcos was 
in guarded condition today and had improved marcos has been 
hospitalized three times in the last six weeks twice for treatment 
of congestive heart failure 
ms kop said marcos doctors refused to say whether he was dying 
she said she did not know when he would be released 
the hearing which will include testimony by several doctors may 
take several days 
youre saying he can never be arraigned anywhere because hes 
not competent medically to stand trial keenan asked marcos 
attorney richard a hibey at a court session wednesday 
thats correct hibey replied 
in a letter made public hibey told the judge we have been 
advised by the last doctor who examined president marcos that he is 
dying 
what began as merely a request to hold mr marcos arraignment 
in honolulu rather than new york has evolved into a genuine concern 
for his life hibey wrote in the letter dated tuesday which 
included an abbreviated doctors report 
labella however told keenan that marcos pneumonia is a 
reversible condition nonchronic labella argued it was premature 
to determine if marcos was unable to stand trial 
the prosecutor conceded it would be four to six weeks before 
marcos could travel and asked that mr marcos be arraigned as 
promptly as possible in hawaii 
no trial date has been set 
marcos and his wife imelda 59 have been living in honolulu 
since fleeing manila in 1986 
since his indictment in october marcos had asked that the 
arraignment be moved to hawaii citing various health problems 
including kidney and heart ailments however a government doctor 
who examined marcos there last fall pronounced him capable of 
traveling to new york for arraignment 
mrs marcos came to new york in october for arraignment and was 
released on 5 million bond after pleading innocent 
the marcoses are accused of plundering 103 million from the 
philippines treasury funneling it to foreign bank accounts and 
using it to buy prime new york real estate and art works 
the main racketeering charge against the couple carries a maximum 
20year prison sentence upon conviction 
eight marcos associates including saudi businessman and arms 
dealer adnan m khashoggi also were indicted on various charges

lech walesa today said the governments 
offer to legalize solidarity does not go far enough but that 
officials had made progress toward recognizing the independent union 
walesa the leader of solidarity said he was awaiting the 
official text of the communist party statement which outlines 
conditions for legalization before revealing his final position on 
the offer 
when pressed by reporters at st brygidas church in the port 
city of gdansk walesa said it is a lot for this party but it 
is too little for social demands and expectations 
but he said we cant destroy this possibility of true union 
freedom but at the same time we shouldnt struggle for some 
ambitious details 
walesa spoke at his first news conference since the communist 
party central committee cleared the way for the legalization of the 
trade union federation outlawed since 1982 
as walesa concluded his discussion polands leader gen 
wojciech jaruzelski was beginning a rare meeting with reporters in 
warsaw to discuss the developments from the party meeting 
our offer is honest and serious jaruzelski said in his 
opening statement i count on the fact that taking it up 
constructively will allow a historical step in polands 
development that is what we all desire 
during an acrimonious debate the central committee spent two 
days devising conditions for restoring legal status to solidarity 
polands most potent opposition force and the only independent labor 
movement ever allowed in the soviet bloc 
jaruzelski offered to resign as communist party leader and head 
of state after encountering heated opposition to the plan but he 
then received a vote of confidence from the 230member central 
committee 
the government switching course after seven years spent trying 
to eliminate solidarity now is seeking the organizations help in 
battling polands severe economic problems and reforming its 
political system 
prime minister mieczyslaw rakowski has offered to legalize 
solidarity for a twoyear trial on condition it declare support for 
socialism observe a strike moratorium and give up western financial 
aid which has exceeded 1 million a year he recommended the offer 
so long as the union agrees to act as a partner not a political 
opponent 
the resolution passed 14342 
solidarity was formed in gdansk in 1980 crushed in the 
martiallaw crackdown of 1981 and declared illegal the following 
year 
we cannot give up our independence and our sovereignty 
walesa said if we blow it here other people will have to deal 
with the same problem again i dont want my son and his generation 
to live through such things again where it accumulates rocks and 
then explodes 
he added conditions in poland give enough justification to 
everyone of us to strike 
everyone will be justified because the situation is so bad but 
reason shows that this leads nowhere 
adam michnik a senior adviser to walesa called the plenum a 
step forward and said the conditions put forth by the party are 
viewed as a matter for discussion 
for the first time they announced at a plenum that the 
legalization of solidarity can be the subject of talks that is new 
for the first time we have a declaration of intentions michnik 
said 
opposition leaders have said solidarity must be legalized before 
they will sit down with the government for comprehensive talks that 
were proposed during a wave of labor strife in august 
let us see michnik said when asked if walesa now would join 
in those oftdelayed talks he called the partys new position a 
very essential step but said the road ahead still is very 
complicated 
walesa said he saw as a sign of good faith from the government an 
invitation to speak at two legal rallies in warsaw next week one at 
the university he said management at the lenin shipyard where he 
works received an official request that he be excused for the events 
walesa said he will address workers at the shipyard during a 
rally friday and then speak again with reporters 
the full text of the partys position paper on union and 
political freedom is expected to be printed in fridays newspapers

reporters said farewells thursday at the last 
white house press briefing of the reagan administration 
working in the white house is about history said spokesman 
marlin fitzwater who stays on as press secretary in the bush 
administration 
long after the stories of the day are forgotten we will 
remember our history together on a personal basis he said 
all seats in the briefing room were occupied unusual in the 
waning days of the administration with reporters focusing the 
presidentelect 
fitzwater noted that some of the correspondents had covered the 
white house for the full eight years of the reagan administration or 
longer and that many would be back again but he added that one 
thing was sure to change 
we will never again be bound by the personality character or 
decisions of ronald reagan said fitzwater we will never judge 
ourselves and each other by those perspectives again 
fitzwater paid tribute to the reporters saying you have been 
tough unrelenting thoughtful and aggressive yet we have all had a 
hell of a lot of fun and i still think the white house press corps 
is the best 
he also praised assistant press secretary mark weinberg and 
connie gerard who has managed the office for 2 those dinners and shell 
probably be at more so 
maybe its more fitting that we honor her here in the pits where she 
has labored for so long

performing arts along the potomac riverfront that mrs bush made 
three separate appearances in the concert hall the opera house 
and the eisenhower theater 
known for her wit and for not putting on airs mrs bush stood on 
one stage and told the audience please notice hairdo makeup 
designer dress look at me good this week 
dressed in a blue suit with a big patterned bow at her neck mrs 
bush said she was a little nervous as she stumbled over the name 
of national symphony orchestra music director mstislav rostropovich 
then she proceeded to joke abbut her husbands comments on how 
tedious it has been for him to pack up in preparation for the move 
to the white house 
noting he spent two days fishing last week in florida mrs bush 
said so much to the packing story 
mrs bush was introduced by marilyn quayle the wife of the vice 
presidentelect whose voice cracked as she described the new first 
lady as a woman of gentleness and kindness and indomitable 
spirit 
im going to get weepy mrs quayle said 
in earlier comments mrs bush has said the feelings she has 
about her husbands inauguration are like those she experienced 
before her wedding day 43 years ago shes excited but shes nervous 
im still pinching myself said mrs bush who becomes the 
nations first lady on friday the day george bush is sworn in as 
the 41st president 
mrs bush a 63yearold grandmother whose trademark is her white 
hair and the threestrand choker of fake pearls has said jokingly 
that shes going to be a new kind of role model for american women 
my mail tells me that a lot of fat whitehaired wrinkled 
ladies are tickled pink she said in an interview with a group of 
newspaper reporters last week 
mrs bush also talked about how she intends to be an activist 
promoting literacy and the needs of children the homeless and aids 
victims 
but the soontobe first lady known for her bluntspoken manner 
and selfdeprecating sense of humor said she doesnt plan to meddle 
in her husbands business even though shes very candid about 
speaking her mind 
thats why we do so well she said i dont have to talk to 
his staff i talk to him 
after the election she accompanied her husband on vacations to 
florida and maine but she declined to go to texas for a 
quailhunting trip after christmas so she could sort through her

before theyve lived in 28 houses and 17 cities since their

refurbishing the public rooms in 1981 the bushes however will 
receive 50000 to redo their living quarters

theres nothing left to loot in there and theyve already shot 
out most of the street lights said coral gables police sgt wayne 
harris he was part of a 26man force assembled to sweep the 
adjacent coconut grove neighborhood on miamis south side after 
seven or eight gunshots were heard and two molotov cocktails were 
tossed into roadways

received reports of car fires smashed store windows a minor fire 
at a fastfood restaurant and some rock and bottlethrowing 
and in the overtown section just north of downtown where the

fire investigators have found the damage in the riot areas to be 
less than first expected said christy lemay a miami fire 
department spokeswoman seven of the burned buildings were abandoned 
and in some cases already destroyed 
the rioting also has left imageconscious city officials 
scrambling to minimize the impact on sundays super bowl the 
cincinnati bengals remained at their downtown hotel just blocks 
from the overtown disturbances

glitter off the super bowl said dick anderson a former miami 
dolphin player and chairman of a host city committee spending 2 
million this week to enhance miamis image 
thats really what life is over there said bengals 
quarterback boomer esiason it really puts this game in 
perspective

outbreaks of violence with shows of force field forces of 
officers clad in bulletproof vests and riot gear were stationed on 
the edge of the riottorn neighborhoods caravans of squad cars 
raced through the areas and swat teams searched for troublemakers 
we hope we can normalize and go back to routine patrolling 
said deputy police chief walter martinez we dont like being out 
here 12 hours and being shot at 
speaking at the city commission meeting mayor xavier suarez 
apologized to police for actions that may have endangered their 
lives unduly 
suarez didnt elaborate at the meeting but he told the new york 
times that he may have erred when he allowed the sister of the dead 
motorcyclist to view her brothers body shortly after he was shot 
monday night the times reported today he said her reaction 
appeared to incite a group of nearby youths who showered police 
with bottles 
i took the sister over to the deceased suarez said i 
should have done that under more controlled circumstances all the 
kids followed me things got out of hand i dont believe what i did 
was the trigger in fact i may have helped for a while by going 
there and talking to people but i would have done it differently if 
i had it to do all over again 
the times said suarez later called to say that he had not 
intended those comments for publication 
black leaders warned suarez before the commission meeting 
wednesday that their community would no longer accept empty promises 
and business as usual 
the word is out that there will be more disturbance said the 
rev william washington now weve got to act and act quick

investigate the shooting of clement lloyd who was speeding with a 
friend allen blanchard through overtown blanchard died in a 
hospital tuesday of injuries from the motorcycle crash

miller dawkins the lone black on the fivemember commission who 
wanted a board consisting of five policemen and five overtown 
residents with the mayor as chairman 
dawkins said the board will not satisfy the young people throwing 
rocks and bottles and he appealed to them for time 
id like to tell them to give us a chance to work this out and 
to work on all our other ills such as poor housing poor education 
joblessness he said and they have to work with us instead of 
creating other problems like they are doing now 
the fbi the state attorneys office and the police internal 
review board are also investigating the police shooting william 
lozano 29 the colombianborn police officer who shot the 
motorcyclist in the head was relieved of duty with pay pending the 
investigation

nightline that his department had major concerns about the 
shooting 
there seem to be some unusual circumstances the police chief 
said 
most schools that closed tuesday reopened although attendance 
was down 
liberty city was the site of a 1980 race riot also linked to the 
death of a black motorcylist at the hands of white police officers 
the 1980 uprising left 18 people dead in 1982 a riot in overtown

secondgraders at webster elementary have adopted a 4yearold 
northern pacific humpback whale named flo

spots marring the taj mahal probably came 
from material used to restore the 17th century monument not from 
pollution news reports said thursday 
scientists had thought the black and yellow spots were caused by 
chemical pollutants discharged from a refinery near the taj mahal in 
the northern city of agra 
however op agrawal director of the national research 
laboratory for the conservation of cultural property said 
accumulating dirt and material used to restore the monument were to 
blame according to the united news of india 
the study pointed to polymer resin used to renovate the monument 
a few decades ago as a likely source of the problem 
builders completed the taj mahal ordered by shah jahan as a 
mausoleum for a favorite wife in 1653

an elderly couple who claimed they were 
unaware their grandson had turned their home into a base for drug 
trafficking have agreed to sell the house and split the proceeds 
with the government 
a 1987 raid on the house turned up nearly 50000 worth of 
marijuana and cocaine and a cache of weapons including a loaded 
israeli assault rifle and riot police shotguns 
the couple had fought forfeiture but their attorney said 
wednesday they were satisfied with the settlement that forces the 
sale and gives them half the proceeds because the house had too 
many bad memories a 1984 federal law allows the seizure of

the year 2000 have called for raising taxes on tobacco banning its 
sale to people under 18 years old and outlawing it in more public 
places

series of measures in the next six years they include ensuring a 
smokefree environment in schools increasing taxes on tobacco 
products and outlawing their sale to people under 18 
the plan also calls for a smoking ban in prisons and other public 
institutions as well as in all hotel rooms and concert halls 
the government has endorsed the goal of making norway smokeless 
by the end of the century however tobacco consumption in recent 
years has increased by 500 tons per year

president reagan leaves an america thats 
older eats less red meat gives birth to fewer babies is less 
likely to divorce and has 16741546 more residents than when he 
took over the white house eight years ago 
the census bureau estimated the population at 246879546 as of 
jan 1 of this year when reagan took office in 1981 it stood at 
230138000 
that means an increase of 16741546 people in eight years or a 
population growth of 5749 peopleaday under the reagan 
administration 
just as well because the extra wage earners will be needed to 
help pay a national debt which grew sharply over the period rising 
from 994 billion in 1981 to an anticipated 287 trillion by the 
end of this year 
reagans california is still the most populous state of course 
and getting more entrenched every day new york and texas remain 
second and third 
but florida which ranked seventh in 1980 was up to fourth place 
by 1987 having passed pennsylvania illinois and ohio on the way 
many of those new floridians are retirees americans are older a 
bit on average 
in 1980 the median age of all americans was 30 years that means 
half were 30 or older and half under 30 
by 1987 the nations median age had risen to 321 despite all 
the new babies contributing to the overall population growth 
longer lives are a chief reason for the rising median age 
when the oldest president took office national life expectancy 
was 742 years and 44 percent of the people were aged 75 and over 
by 1987 life expectancy was up to 749 and nearly 5 percent were 
in the 75andolder age group the nations death rate fell from 88 
per 1000 people in 1980 to 87 in 1987 
at the other end of the lifespan infant mortality has declined 
sharply from 126 infant deaths per 1000 live births in 1980 to 10 
in 1987 
perhaps helping in this was the increase in physicians during 
this period in 1980 there were 211 doctors for every 100000 
americans while by 1985 that had climbed to 237 per 100000 
the nations birth rate has dropped during the reagan years 
the national center for health statistics reported that 159 
babies were born in 1980 for every 1000 americans by 1987 that was 
down to 157 
the number of orphans has also dropped from 52000 children who 
had lost both parents in 1980 to 30000 in 1986 
marriage seems to have grown somewhat less attractive during the 
eightyear reagan span in 1980 there were 106 marriages for every 
1000 people by 1987 that rate had fallen to 99 per 1000 
the number of unmarried couples living together rose 63 percent 
to 26 million from 1980 to 1988 
at the same time divorce has become less common with the rate 
dropping from 52 per 1000 in 1980 to 48 in 1987 
overall though the majority of households still consist of 
families that include a married couple though the share slipped 
from 608 percent to 569 percent from 1980 to 1988 
the divorce rate has fallen even though the number of lawyers 
in the country grew from 542205 in 1980 to 655191 in 1985 
crime offered fewer job opportunities for lawyers too the 
reported crime rate fell from 5950 per 100000 people in 1980 to 
5480 in 1986 but the populations of the federal and state state 
prisons climbed from 315974 in 1980 to 523922 in 1986 
on a more individual front americans have made some changes in 
their personal habits in recent years 
in 1980 us residents ate an average of 1572 pounds of red 
meat by 1986 than had fallen to 1505 pounds 
at the same time fish consumption climbed from 128 pounds to 
147 pounds 
americans eat a lot more chicken 591 pounds up from 501 
pounds in 1980 grain consumption jumped from 1169 pounds to 1296 
pounds while the average for fresh vegetables went from 726 pounds 
to 794 pounds and fresh fruit rose from 867 pounds to 914 pounds 
per person per year 
alcohol imbibing fell during the 1980 to 1986 period from 293 
gallons to 276 gallons per capita even though total consumption of 
beverages rose from 1357 gallons to 1403 gallons 
soft drinks gained from 378 gallons to 456 gallons over the 
period while juices increased from 63 gallons to 73 gallons 
there were modest declines reported in consumption of milk coffee 
and tea 
at another level the united states grew during the reagan years 
or at least came to assert an economic interest over millions more 
square miles than it did before reagan 
on march 10 1983 reagan proclaimed an exclusive economic zone 
extending us interests to the area 200 miles off the coasts the 
eez is not a claim to jurisdiction over territorial waters but it 
amounts to an assertion of us mineral and fishing rights within 
the entire zone however foreign ships and aircraft can still pass 
freely through the economic zone 
the eez totals 44 million square miles larger than the nations 
36 million square miles

boeing co says it is reviewing design testing 
and maintenance to make it physically impossible to make wiring 
errors like those found in seven boeing 757s 
the federal aviation administration last week ordered checks on 
all 757s after learning of faulty wiring in the cargo hold fire 
extinguishing systems in a royal brunei jet and a similar problem in 
a delta airlines plane 
faulty wiring has been found in five more 757s since the 
inspections were ordered 
investigators said some of the crossed wires would have caused 
the wrong extinguisher to work in the event of a cargo hold fire 
other mistakes would have indicated a fire to the pilot without 
activating a sprinkler 
boeing on wednesday said that of the 205 of the twinengine 
midsized airliners in use worldwide 191 have been examined and 
three foreign carriers have yet to report findings on the remaining 
24 
well go back and look at the design work to see what kinds of 
physical things we can do so that it would be physically impossible 
for the installer to make a mistake jack gamble of boeing 
commercial airplanes said wednesday 
we will look at the testing procedures to see if we should 
devise some additional ways of testing as a cross check 
the 757 went into service in 1984 all the miswired planes were 
manufactured around 1986 and none had had cargohold fires gamble 
said 
gamble maintenance manuals would be reviewed because the company 
has yet to rule out wiring errors during maintenance 
there were seven airplanes and seven mistakes and there was no 
pattern to lead us to believe that they came from the same spot 
he said 
a separate check of some newer boeing 737s in great britain and 
the united states found no wiring problems boeing said 
those inspections resulted from speculation that crossed wires 
might have led the pilot of a british midland 737400 to shut down 
his undamaged right engine after the left caught fire resulting in 
a crash that killed 44 this month 
boeing has required maximum overtime and hired new workers in the 
past year to meet tight delivery schedules for planes and parts but 
boeing faa and airline officials said they remained confident about 
the level of quality 
everything that is done by boeing is subject to a quality 
control process that is monitored constantly and we dont believe 
there is a concern at this point said mitch barker an faa 
spokesman

paintings of glamorous women with exotic

some womens rights groups say the world war iiera art form 
should have been left in the 1940s

short on clothes 
i would hope that chapter had been closed mary ruthsdaughter

the art also adds personality said sawyer spokesman capt paul 
bicking 
b52h0060 is now known as diamond girl bomber number 0038 has 
become 38 special displaying a busty figure in a bikini while 
0047 is a leggy classy chassis

paintings that adorned planes in world war ii 
these days the lovely ladies painted over dull grayishblack 
camouflage paint are in subdued less visible hues of dusky red and 
shady blue 
sawyer also has added subdued rainbows to the tails of its kc135

roman catholic bishops from nine southern 
african nations thursday appealed to their governments and 
guerrillas in the region to make peace 
listen to us the bishops implored in a 21page lenten 
pastoral letter lay down your arms 
the letter written after three years of research and approved by 
pope john paul ii when he visited zimbabwe in september was 
published in harare by the interregional meeting of bishops of 
southern africa 
the prelates represent angola botswana lesotho mozambique 
namibia sao tome and principe south africa swaziland and zimbabwe 
except for sao tome and principe each nation has suffered from 
regional conflicts in which hundreds of thousands of people have 
been killed countless others maimed and still others driven into 
exile as refugees 
bishop patrick mutume of zimbabwe described the letter as a 
blueprint for peace in southern africa 
both sides must lay down their arms mutume said at a news 
conference the call is not for only one side everybody must 
talk 
the letter says it is a main function of the state to provide 
security for its citizens but the wars that have been dragging on 
in southern africa for years show that war does not provide security 
for peoples but provides hatred and destruction 
we believe there is only one alternative to be followed that 
of negotiation the letter says 
it was signed by the chairman of the bishops group jaime 
goncalves archbishop of the beira diocese in mozambique 
mozambique president joaquim chissano censured goncalves last 
year for urging peace talks with rightwing rebels in the former 
portuguese colony 
mutume said the bishops appeal was directed as much at south 
africa and guerrillas fighting its whiterun government as it was at 
countries such as mozambique 
the peace accord recently signed by angola cuba and south africa 
was a sign of hope for the region the pastoral letter said the 
pact promises independence for namibia a territory now governed by 
south africa in return for the withdrawal of 50000 troops from 
neighboring angola 
the bishops attacked capitalist and socialist systems in the 
region saying both caused unemployment poverty and hunger 
they also described south africas apartheid policy of racial 
segregation as a flagrantly unjust system which by law as well as 
practice discriminates against the ethnic majority of that country 
and denies them land economic and political rights 
we express our outrage and horror at this system of oppression 
which insults the dignity of the human person and is an offense 
against god the letter said 
the bishops also rapped angolas marxist government for 
discriminating against christians a practice the letter said was 
a new form of apartheid no less grave 
they reiterated their support for nonviolent community action 
and protest when prolonged systematic injustices could not be 
reversed

a state circuit court judge today refused 
to block tuesdays scheduled execution of triple killer ted bundy 
who faces his fourth execution date 
judge john peach denied three claims in bundys appeal filed in 
the north florida city where bundy abducted his last victim 
its time were approaching the 11th anniverary of the 
death of kimberly leach and ted bundy is still alive said 
columbia county state attorney jerry blair who prosecuted bundy for 
the 1978 murder of 12yearold kimberly leach 
unless he wins a stay the 42yearold former law student once 
on the fbis mostwanted list as a suspect in as many as 36 
sexrelated murders and disappearances is scheduled to die in 
floridas electric chair on tuesday 
i think we should have won but well win because his claims 
are valid said james coleman a washington dc attorney 
representing bundy he said the case would be heard friday by the 
florida supreme court 
the appeal centered on three issues bundys competence at the 
time he rejected a plea bargain agreement that would have kept him 
from the electric chair ongoing litigation in a separate case in 
which bundy was convicted of murdering two florida state university 
sorority sisters and claims that the original trial judge received 
material from the prosecution that the defense didnt know about 
all were rejected by peach who heard the arguments after circuit 
judge wallace m jopling disqualified himself in response to a 
motion by bundys attorneys 
bundys attorneys say he should be given time to reveal what he 
knows about dozens of unsolved slayings but gov bob martinez says 
bundy is just trying to foil justice 
bundy whose case was depicted in the television miniseries the 
deliberate stranger was sentenced to death for the february 1978 
murder of miss leach of lake city he also was sentenced to death 
for fatally bludgeoning two florida state university sorority 
sisters 
bundys civil attorney diana weiner of sarasota on wednesday 
told the governors deathpenalty lawyer andrea smith hillyer that 
bundy was committed to revealing all he knew about unsolved murders 
weiner didnt specify which cases 
ted bundy feels morally compelled as he faces death to do the 
right thing in terms of resolving any investigations she said 
while it may satisfyingly close the book on the florida cases the 
immediate execution will effectively cripple law enforcement 
agencies around the country 
martinez disagreed but said he would make bundy available to any 
law agency in the days remaining before the execution 
i know that he has basically lied through this entire process 
and why anyone would believe he would tell the truth now is beyond 
me martinez said were not going to have the system 
manipulated 
one of the things to be made clear here to law enforcement 
which i think they realize more than anyone else what ted bundy has 
done is you dont negotiate with a murderer you dont negotiate 
with a killer martinez said 
martinez signed the death warrant on tuesday less than a hour 
after the us supreme court declined to hear new arguments to set 
aside bundys death sentence 
bundy has insisted he is innocent of any murder 
bob keppel of the washington state attorney generals office has 
told florida officials he wants to talk with bundy who has been 
linked to eight killings in that state 
the fbis national center for violent crime in quantico va 
also wants to interview bundy authorities said 
in utah salt lake county sheriff pete hayward said he is sending 
detective dennis couch to florida saturday morning in hopes of 
interviewing bundy a former university of utah law student 
but salt lake detective dennis couch said bundy told officials 
wednesday he would not meet with him 
also announced wednesday was bundys decision to grant an 
interview to james dobson host of a pomona califbased radio 
show called focus on the family 
dobson said he has exchanged letters with bundy for the past two 
years he said he didnt know what bundy wants to discuss 
when a man is looking death in the face he doesnt waste words 
and i want to hear what he has to say said dobson who has a 
30minute christianoriented radio show 
bundy has been granted a stay of execution three times before 
the last was issued nov 17 1986 six hours before his scheduled 
execution when the 11th us circuit court of appeals in atlanta 
sent the case back for an evidentiary hearing the appeals court 
and later the us supreme court rejected the appeal

a state legislator is going on the 
offensive against fax attacks unsolicited advertising received 
over facsimile machines 
rep richard tulisano chairman of the judiciary committee said 
wednesday he has proposed a bill banning the use of fax machines to 
send unsolicited ads 
as fax machines become more prevalent they become a vehicle 
for unsolicited advertisements thereby tying up not only your 
machine but using your papers all your fluids and all that 
stuff said tulisano who added that he planned to buy a fax 
machine soon 
fax machines permit users to send and receive copies of documents 
over telephone lines 
a legislative research report on tulisanos bill found that 
facsimile paper costs up to 10 cents a page 
donna murdoch executive director of the american fascimile 
association in philadelphia which publishes a newsletter for 
facsimile users said the debate over junk fax is much ado about 
nothing 
we ask people how many pieces of junk fax are you really 
getting she said and people say the most they can remember 
getting is two pieces in a week 
mr fax a company based in irvine calif sells facsimile 
supplies via unsolicited fax ads we think this is a very 
lowcost convenient method of marketing said elliott segal vice 
president for marketing 
segal said laws against unsolicited fax messages would punish 
the entire fax population for something that has generated 
relatively few complaints

housing construction dropped 82 percent in 
1988 to its lowest level in six years the government reported 
thursday but analysts said the industry remained in good shape as 
it weathered a moderate slowdown after the postrecession boom 
construction of both singlefamily homes and apartments fell 
during 1988 to leave total housing starts at 149 million units it 
was the poorest showing since the recession year of 1982 when 106 
million units were built 
analysts said that despite the decline which is likely to 
continue into the current year 1988 was a good year for the housing 
industry because the level of construction remained relatively high 
we do not get very concerned when were building over a million 
singlefamily homes a year said dale stuard president of the 
national association of homebuilders 
theres nothing to get panicky about he said its a very 
controlled slowdown 
analysts said the decline had been expected because much of the 
pentup demand for homes that developed during the recession was 
satisfied in subsequent boom years and housing requirements are 
decreasing with the aging of the baby boom generation 
in addition mortgage interest rates are inching upward interest 
on fixedrate mortgages reached 1081 percent last week according 
to the federal home loan mortgage corp 
economist mark obrinsky of the us league of savings 
institutions said the housing industry held up reasonably well 
all things considered nonetheless it is a decline and i think 
well see a little further decline in 1989 
housing construction reached its postrecession peak in 1986 
when 181 units were built then began sliding analysts believe 
further decreases are inevitable as interest rates continue to rise 
the economic expansion runs its course and demographics take their 
toll 
as we go through the years toward the year 2000 we need fewer 
and fewer net additions to our stock of housing said economist 
richard peach of the mortgage bankers association of america 
were just not creating as many new households as we used to 
decembers seasonally adjusted annual construction rate of 152 
million units was down a moderate 22 percent from a month earlier 
the small drop from november is encouraging and suggests that 
the housing sector will start 1989 with good momentum said john 
a tuccillo chief economist for the national association of 
realtors 
building permits considered a good indication of future 
activity were up 18 percent in december to an annual rate of 154 
million units for the year building permits totaled 146 million 
units down from 153 million a year earlier 
singlefamily homes in december were built at a seasonally 
adjusted annual rate of 111 million units down 19 percent from a 
month earlier for the year singlefamily home construction dropped 
58 percent to 108 million units 
apartment construction always volatile reached an annual rate 
of 410000 units during december down 31 percent from a month 
earlier for the year construction was down 141 percent to 407000 
units 
the apartment sector has been plagued by widespread overbuilding 
and changes in federal tax law that removed many of the incentives 
for investing in rental projects 
all four regions of the country experienced decreased housing 
starts during the year with construction in the northeast down 125 
percent the south down 93 percent the midwest down 85 percent 
and the west down 36 percent 
but construction in the midwest shot up 251 percent in december 
to a seasonally adjusted 329000 units the fourth straight monthly 
increase peach said the recent gains indicate the region is on a 
longerterm trend of recovery from the days when everyone called it 
the rust belt 
the northeast meanwhile was down 201 percent in december to 
179000 units reflecting a slowdown after strong expansion earlier 
economist martin regalia of the national council of savings 
institutions said there could be cause for concern if the 
slowdown in the northeast continues but that the downward movement 
thus far was not alarming

president reagan acknowledged today that he 
leaves office without a hint or a clue as to the whereabouts of 
americans held hostage in lebanon and said any overt rescue attempt 
could risk their execution 
we dont know where they are reagan said in a farewell 
interview with news service reporters 
the president said that while he feels badly about the hostages 
languishing in the hands of proiranian elements in lebanon the 
situation should not be likened to the one that existed when he came 
to office in january 1981 
fiftytwo americans held hostage in tehran were released on jan 
20 1981 the same day reagan was inaugurated and president jimmy 
carter left office reagan had criticized carter during the 1980 
campaign for having been unable to win the hostages release 
on jan 7 1980 while campaigning for the gop presidential 
nomination in the new hampshire primary reagan said carters 
response to the taking of american hostages in iran was too 
sluggish 
i believe its appropriate to suggest that anything that has 
been done by the administration so far could have should have 
been done in the first hour reagan said the united states should 
have ordered an economic boycott hesaid and set a deadline beyond 
which the boycotted country could not go without serious harm to 
itself 
in todays interview reagan did not take back that criticism 
we were facing two very different situations he said noting 
that in the earlier situation more than 50 people had been held in 
an embassy and that they had been kidnapped by the government of 
iran this is another one in which some terrorist group has 
kidnapped several individuals he said 
we know that any overt attempt at rescue even if we did have a 
hint or a clue could run the risk of their assassination or 
execution before we could get them out reagan said there 
hasnt been a moment that this hasnt been on my mind i think 
the two situations are completely different 
reagan said however that at the end of carters term i made 
a number of statements and so forth that were aimed at helping in 
other words portraying myself and the things i said to that 
government that was holding them that maybe theyd rather deal with 
him than wait and deal with me 
during a wideranging halfhour interview in the oval office one 
of a spate that reagan has granted as his presidency draws to an 
end he also said 
a technical state of war does still exist between israel and 
the arab nations and us officials believe that peace can only 
come about when the principals themselves agree to negotiations 
he did not know of any presidential pardons that are 
imminent although he did not rule out any eleventhhour pardons 
it doesnt seem very likely he said 
he still believes that former white house aides oliver l north 
and john m poindexter eventually will be cleared of any criminal 
wrongdoing in the irancontra case and he believes trials should 
proceed so there will be no lingering doubt about their innocence 
he appreciates the potential of us military power and the 
responsibility of a president saying i dont think there has ever 
been a moment in his eightyear presidency when he had to consider 
ordering a nuclear attack 
im quite sure wed never be the first to press the button 
reagan said 
reagan said he would not give unsolicited advice to 
presidentelect bush after leaving office friday but would try to 
help if asked 
on the question of us dealings with the soviet union reagan 
said he thought bush would move forward on the issue of reducing the 
superpower stockpiles of longrange nuclear weapons but that 
caution should be used 
i think we have to realize that in these negotiations 
theyre not just based on what someone says theyre based on 
deeds he said and i think that george will be very prepared 
there based on what the deeds are 
reagan said he does not believe that he is less popular in europe 
than soviet president mikhail s gorbachev as some polls have shown 
i cant quite accept that hes more popular than i am reagan 
said 
the president criticized what he called a total media 
distortion of the nature of covert us arms sales to iran in 
198586 through israel 
reagan said that the initiative got under way at a time when 
everyone was saying that the ayatollah was not going to live out the 
week he repeated his oftstated position that the sales of 
antitank and antiaircraft missiles to elements in iran did not 
amount to trading arms for hostages 
reagan said us arms were sold to moderates in iran who would 
turn it over not to the revolutionary government of iran but to 
the regular military which had been created in large part by 
the united states and it would give them the prestige they need 
if they were to be able to take over the government and establish a 
democratic government there

the senate foreign relations committee in a 
strong show of bipartisan support voted 190 thursday to recommend 
the senate confirm james a baker iii as secretary of state 
the senate is expected to approve the baker nomination possibly 
unanimously in a roll call vote next wednesday 
baker 58 who served president reagan as white house chief of 
staff and secretrary of the treasury is one of presidentelect 
george bushs closest friends and managed his 1980 and 1988 
presidential campaigns 
in two days of testimony this week he displayed a comprehensive 
grasp of foreign policy issues issuing a strong call for a new era 
of bipartisanship as the keystone to success 
he said this was especially true in central america where 
wrangling between the reagan white house and congress led baker 
said to stalemate and a distinct lack of success in dealing with 
nicaraguas leftist sandinista government 
on a note of caution baker said the united states should 
exercise restraint in its relations with the soviet union viewing 
the domestic foreign policy and defense changes being made by 
president mikhail s gorbachev with prudence and realism 
he endorsed the general outlines of reagan administration foreign 
policy while sidestepping questions about any specific changes bush 
may make or specific initiatives he may undertake 
after the panels unanimous vote committee members hailed baker 
in high terms 
the chairman sen claiborne pell dri said the vote 
represents approval for baker as a man a belief in him as an 
experienced and able public servant 
pell said the vote did not indicate that the committees 
democratic majority will agree with baker on every foreign policy 
issue over the next four years 
but we are certainly starting out on a more even keel pell 
said 
sen frank murkowski ralaska said he believes the unanimous 
nature of the vote represents a bipartisan approach to the new 
administration 
sen larry pressler rsd said of baker hes one of the all 
time washinagton greats 
i am very optimistic he is going to be an outstanding secretary 
of state said sen paul sarbanes dmd he has diplomacy 
restraint and carefulness i think hes the kind of person that 
would work very well with congress

at least two genes play a role in the 
development of multiple sclerosis a finding that supports earlier 
studies that susceptibility to the crippling disease is powerfully 
influenced by heredity a researcher said thursday 
dr dale e mcfarlin a researcher at the national institute of 
neurological disorders and stroke said he and colleagues at the 
california institute of technology and the university of california 
in los angeles have found that certain combinations of tcell 
receptor genes occur more often in ms patients than in healthy 
people 
what this suggests is that there is a genetic component in ms 
but there is more than one gene mcfarlin said in a telephone 
interview 
mcfarlin said that though the study shows heredity may increase a 
persons susceptibility to ms the disease is not purely 
genetic other components as yet unknown also must be present 
for multiple sclerosis to develop he said 
multiple sclerosis is a disease of unknown origin that attacks 
the tissue covering nerves in the brain and spinal column this can 
result in vision disturbances weakness and eventually crippling 
disability no successful treatment for the disease has been found 
mcfarlin said earlier studies showed a gene that reacts to an 
antigen called dr2 may play a role in multiple sclerosis now the 
new study shows that a combination of genes that help build the 
tcell receptor also is involved in the disease 
the tcell is a diseasefighting cell produced by the immune 
system molecules on the surface of the tcell called receptors 
lock onto antigens which are molecules recognized by the immune 
system as foreign bodies such as germs 
mcfarlin said that the new study has shown that patients who have 
an abnormal combination of tcell genes plus an elevated level of 
dr2 antigen are three times as likely to develop ms as healthy 
people without these genetic characteristics 
the study focused on a group that includes the tcell genes said 
mcfarlin but the specific gene in that group that plays a role in 
ms has not been identified 
more work needs to be done on that he said 
the study was published in the journal of neuroimmunology

the environmental protection agency said 
thursday it will try to keep the nation from losing any more swamps 
marshes and other wetlands a conservation goal presidentelect bush 
endorsed during the campaign 
any unavoidable losses should be fully offset by wetlands 
restoration or creation the agency said 
such a goal was recommended last november by a study group led by 
new jersey gov thomas kean under the sponsorship of the 
conservation foundation bush had earlier said the nation should aim 
for a no net loss wetlands policy 
since then bush has chosen william reilly the foundations 
president to head the epa 
the agency said it would step up enforcement of existing water 
pollution laws dealing with wetlands cooperate more closely with 
other federal agencies and encourage the states to develop 
protection programs 
much wetlands decisionmaking is in the hands of the states and 
local governments the principal federal power is the authority of 
the army corps of engineers to grant permits for putting fill in 
waterways and wetlands a process over which the epa has certain 
veto powers 
the agency can delegate those powers to the states so far only 
michigan has been granted that authority 
gail bingham vice president of the foundation said we are 
delighted with epas new policy 
thought for generations to be nothing more than the breeding 
grounds of disease wetlands today are recognized by 
conservationists as an important cog in natures machine playing 
important roles in water purification and storage as a habitat for 
wildlife including many endangered species and in the productivity 
of marine life including commercially important species 
the study group noted however that wetlands often are sought by 
developers as the only closein land to large urban areas 
of the 200 million acres of fens bogs marshes estuaries 
swamps and other wetlands in the united states at the time of 
settlement by europeans in the 17th century about half remain 
there are no good estimates of how much is lost each year one 
widely cited estimate of 450000 acres annually was made in the 
1970s when farmers were believed to be bringing more wetlands under 
the plow than they are now the conservation foundation uses a range 
of 200000 acres to 450000 acres

they yawned they squinted they fidgeted and 
they sang 76 boys with voices like angels rehearsing thursday for 
the threeminute performance that will put their county on the map 
again 
more than 50 years after coal mining union battles left the 
legacy of bloody harlan the harlan ky boys choir stood on the 
west front of the capitol singing this is my country in 
fourpart harmony 
bass and tenor you need to tone down a bit sing away from 
that mike director david davies barked at his boys a bunch of 
10to19yearolds in jeans sneakers and bright green boys choir 
jackets 
you were shifting your feet you were moving your eyes and 
youre scratching your noses he shouted incredulously dont 
scratch your noses 
it was a jarring note of reality in the fairy tale of how the 
24yearold choir won a place in the brief inaugural ceremony a 
slot normally reserved for star entertainers or hometown favorites 
of the presidentelect 
while the final decision was up to george bush it didnt hurt 
that the chairman of the inaugural proceedings is sen wendell ford 
dky 
ive been kin to you for a long time ford told the boys 
before their runthrough in the midday sun in 1972 as governor he 
gave them 5000 from a contingency fund for a trip to compete in 
graz austria this year hes playing proud host and dutch uncle 
told that the choir raised 51000 for its trip to washington 
more than twice its 25000 goal ford commented see what 
charisma you have what drawing power now fellas dont think its 
going to be that easy in the real world 
theyve been all over the country as well as to europe but the 
boys and parents agree this trip tops all 
this is the zenith its just awesome the boys just cant 
believe it said dawn nunez the finance chairman whose 
17yearold son matt has been in the choir for eight years 
everythings larger than life it doesnt seem real because 
theres so much history said choir president richard atkins 17 
im a little more relaxed than i thought i would be said seth 
spoelman 14 
all the boys are from harlan countys 1200student school 
system they come from all racial and economic backgrounds the sons 
of insurance agents and coal miners as well as doctors and lawyers 
weve got football players basketball players this is the in 
thing to do at our school said mrs nunez its not considered 
a sissy thing agreed roy allison the choirs business manager 
mrs nunez who was in charge of raising money for the choirs 
trip said her job was easy we didnt even have to ask many 
donations werent even solicited she said people know that we 
have met our goal and theyre still sending in money 
the biggest contribution was 5000 from the new york times she 
said the kentucky governor gave 3000 and a few anonymous donors 
gave 1000 apiece she said but most of the money came in small 
chunks from local businesses and residents 
music is a big thing in the hills of kentucky she said 
whenever the choir does something the community gets behind it 
its supposed to be a mean place bloody harlan its been 
called weve never been able to live that down said allison 
but i couldnt tell you when there was a mugging in harlan when a 
woman was raped when there was an armed robbery in harlan youd be 
perfectly safe walking down our streets you might not see much but 
youd be safe 
harlan remains coal country and boys graduating from the choir 
each receive a coal miners hard hat but the choirs inaugural 
appearance has already drawn a different kind of attention to harlan 
networks and filmmakers are doing reports and documentaries not 
about union violence but about a group of disciplined boys who will 
sing beneath five us flags for the new president of the united 
states 
said allison this is the most significant thing ever to happen 
to harlan ky

a fire erupted in the tail of 
a boeing 737 as it taxied at vancouver international airport 
forcing 59 passengers and six crew members to make an emergency 
exit authorities said 
there were no injuries in the evacuation wednesday night 
the canadian airlines international flight originated in saint 
john new brunswick with stops in halifax nova scotia and ottawa 
said airline spokeman phil ablitt 
the fire started in the airliners auxiliary power unit a small 
jet engine in the tail of the plane used to power its air 
conditioner and other systems while on the ground he said 
a warning system alerted the crew to a rise in the units exhaust 
temperature and the tower also noticed there was smoke from the 
exhaust area ablitt said 
the crew discharged a fire extinguisher bottle into the area as 
a precaution and carried out a passenger evacuation on the ramp 
ablitt said 
the fire was contained within the power units fire shield and 
the damage was minor he said the damaged unit will be taken apart 
but ablitt declined to speculate on the cause of the fire 
in seattle boeing commercial airplanes spokesman david jimenez 
referred questions to the airline and said the incident has 
nothing to do with us at the moment

as every school kid must know by now george 
bush will repeat a 35word oath to become president of the united 
states at noon friday 
as probably few school kids know dan quayle will recite a 
70word oath to become vice president both oaths say substantially 
the same thing but the vice president is required by law to take 
twice as long saying it 
the difference would suggest that the framers of the second oath 
might have been more suspicious or at least more nervous about new 
vice presidents than new presidents thus they spelled out 
conditions in greater detail for the second man and insisted he 
invoke gods help 
in none of this could they have had dan quayle in mind the 
presidential oath was written 202 years ago in the constitution the 
vice presidential oath comes in a law that evolved through several 
congressional statues over more than 100 years 
the president must say i do solemnly swear or affirm that i 
will faithfully execute the office of president of the united 
states and will to the best of my ability preserve protect and 
defend the constitution of the united states 
the vice president according to the inaugural committee must 
say i do solemnly swear that i will support and defend the 
constitution of the united states against all enemies foreign and 
domestic that i will bear true faith and allegiance to the same 
that i take this obligation freely without any mental reservation 
or purpose of evasion that i will well and faithfully discharge the 
duties of the office on which i am about to enter so help me god 
quayle should have no trouble with the wording he has taken a 
similar oath twice as senator 
the careful reader will note that the vice president is more 
circumscribed than the president the president may affirm if he 
doesnt choose to swear solemnly so far only franklin pierce in 
1853 chose to affirm 
the vice president has no choice he has to swear solemnly or not 
get the job not legally 
nothing in the constitution or subsequent law says the president 
of the united states cant be an agnostic or atheist he does not 
have to say so help me god most presidents since george 
washington have said that as a matter of custom or choice 
the vice president is given no choice he must say so help me 
god or he risks unemployment his oath doesnt even specify the 
job he is promising to faithfully execute 
but congress took no chance and left him as little room as 
possible he must swear and forswear for the job that harry truman 
thought was as useful as a cows fifth teat and alben barkley 
called a spare tire on the automobile of government

occidental petroleum corp said 
thursday someone apparently tried to sabatoge the piper alpha oil 
rig 10 months before an explosion and fire on the rig killed 167 men 
a spokeswoman for the los angelesbased company told a panel 
investigating the disaster that a small number of ball bearings were 
found in a gas compressor that had been temporarily shut down the 
spokeswoman fiona mcghie said the bearings were removed without 
incident in september 1987 
i wouldnt like to hazard a guess on the consequences if the 
ball bearings had not been found other than there could have been a 
serious incident ms mcghie said on the first day of the inquiry 
into the july 6 1988 rig fire 
the tiny metal balls were found in the same area of the 
explosions that caused the fire but theres no indication that 
ball bearings were the cause of the disaster she said 
the department of energy already has said in a preliminary 
technical report the disaster was not caused by sabotage but by a 
buildup of gas following a leak in the gas compression module 
the oil platform in the north atlantic was rocked by a series of 
explosions and incinerated by gasfed fires it was the worlds 
worst oil rig accident 
sixtytwo men survived and the bodies of 136 were recovered the 
31 missing victims are believed caught in tons of debris in water 
120 miles off the scottish coast 
outside the inquiry center several protesting relatives held up 
a banner urging the government to bring the men up now 
i will demonstrate until they clear the sea of piper alpha 
said gavin cleland 60 whose 33yearold son robert was killed 
prime minister margaret thatchers administration ordered the 
inquiry to establish the cause of the disaster and recommend ways of 
preventing a recurrence lord douglas cullen is conducting the 
inquiry with three expert assessors 
occidental petroleum said platform managers investigated the 
apparent sabotage incident but did not find a culprit the 
government was not informed until after the july disaster and 
details of the incident will be given to the inquiry it said 
the sabotage had been reported wednesday night by a survivor 
john wood 
we all wondered if there was going to be a police inquiry into 
it but nothing more was ever said wood told independent 
television news so its still a mystery to this day it did worry 
me at the time i was living and working on this platform and 
someone was trying to wreck it with me on it 
occidental petroleum plans to topple the 250foothigh stump of 
the shattered platform with explosives next month it said the 
wrecked platform endangers shipping but relatives of missing men 
oppose the destruction 
margo gordon whose husband james is missing said we have 
got to stop occidental blowing up or toppling that rig 
i could understand and accept better if there were just one or 
two bodies still missing but 31 is a lot of men too many to leave 
it be and allow the families to be written off

tariq aziz however again accused iran of blocking the 
negotiations 
un secretarygeneral javier perez de cuellar is sending swedish 
un ambassador jan eliasson to tehran and baghdad next week in a 
bid to persuade the two sides to show more flexibility 
they the un secretary general and his envoy are bound to 
put things in their correct place and make the iranian side come to 
the negotiations with a practical approach for durable and 
comprehensive peace aziz said

jan 27 he said eliasson will then consult with the un secretary 
general to fix a date for the talks to reopen 
almost eight years of war stopped aug 20 when both iran and 
iraq accepted a unmediated ceasefire 
however three round of talks since then failed to break the 
deadlock over troop withdrawals to prewar borders 
aziz said thursday that irans refusal to release sick and 
wounded iraqi prisoners of war is a major obstacle to peace 
iran and iraq agreed in separate talks with the international 
committee for the red cross last november to exchange a total of 
1158 sick and disabled pows 
the exchange started nov 23 but broke down four days later after 
the iranians freed only half the agreed number they said the rest 
sought asylum in iran

the rate of increase in consumer prices held 
steady in 1988 at 44 percent the government said thursday but 
many economists are warning that inflation could accelarate 
moderately this year 
although the rise in the labor departments consumer price index 
last year was identical to the 1987 gain the reasons were very 
different 
the summer drought pushed food prices up by 52 percent in 1988 
compared with 35 percent a year earlier last years gain was the 
steepest since 1980 consumers got a break on energy costs which 
rose a scant 05 percent compared with 82 percent in 1987 
the inflation rate excluding the volatile food and energy 
catagories a compilation many economists say is a better gauge of 
underlying inflationary pressure than the larger index did 
accelarate from 42 percent in 1987 to 47 percent last year 
the core inflation is ticking up said samuel d kahan an 
economist with kleinwort benson government securities inc in 
chicago i would not treat last years number as something very 
calming 
nevertheless 1988 ended on a moderate note with 03 percent 
increases in both november and december 
last months advance left the price index at 1205 percent of its 
198284 base meaning that a hypothetical selection of goods costing 
100 during the base period would have cost 12050 in december 20 
cents more than in november 
president reagan who will leave office friday has listed the 
taming of inflation as one of his proudest accomplishments during 
his term inflation hit a 25year low of 11 percent in 1986 
under his predecessor jimmy carter the nation saw price 
increases of 133 percent in 1979 and 125 percent in 1980 
many economists worry that the country may be in for a taste of 
the bad old days this year they say tight labor markets and rising 
factory operating rates will inevitably lead to higher costs for 
consumers many predict an inflation rate of 5 percent to 55 
percent 
what you see is no evidence of runaway inflation the kinds of 
problems we had in the late 70s and early 80s but you see 
pressure on prices building on a fundamental level said william 
dunkelberg dean of business at temple university in philadelphia 
unemployment in december matched a 14year low while use of 
factory capacity hit a nineyear high 
meanwhile in other economic news the commerce department said 
housing construction fell 22 percent in december the first decline 
in four months for the year rising mortgage interest rates helped 
to dampen construction activity which fell 82 percent to 149 
million units the lowest rate since the recession year of 1982 
the labor department also reported that americans average weekly 
earnings after adjusting for inflation decreased 04 percent in 
december after falling 05 percent a month earlier 
average weekly earnings last month were 32981 38 percent 
higher than a year ago but still not high enough to keep up with 
inflation 
the department offered these details of inflation in 1988 
hot weather pushed poultry and egg prices up 179 percent and 
165 percent respectively on the other hand beef and pork prices 
fell or rose only slightly during the second half of the year as 
farmers sent more animals to slaughter to reduce the need for feed 
made more expensive by the drought for the year beef was up 56 
percent pork was down 31 percent fruit and vegatable prices rose 
62 percent cereals and baked goods 84 percent and dairy 
products 44 percent 
fuel oil prices jumped 28 percent in december after falling for 
six consecutive months despite the december advance the price was 
63 percent below that of a year earlier electricity charges rose 
11 percent for the year while natural gas was unchanged gasoline 
prices were 11 percent lower than a year ago 
in other areas housing costs rose 40 percent price increases 
for new and used cars were a moderate 21 percent and 34 percent 
respectively however the costs of auto insurance and automoile 
financing took steep jumps of 84 percent and 83 percent 
respectively 
the cost of medical care up 69 percent also rose faster than 
the general inflation rate last year tobacco prices posted one of 
the steepest rises of any subcatagory up 94 percent 
clothing prices rose 48 percent overall with mens and boys 
apparel up 60 percent and womens and girls clothing up 34 
percent 
the federal reserve board whose prime job as the nations 
central bank is to keep inflation under control has been pushing 
interest rates slowly but steadily higher since march in an effort 
to slow the economy and ease inflationary pressures 
in the end i dont think inflation is going to move up all 
that much in 1989 because i think the fed is going to remain very 
vigilant said bruce steinberg an economist with merrill lynch amp 
co

as soon as ronald and nancy reagan exit the 
white house friday to escort george and barbara bush to the 
inaugural ceremonies on capitol hill the mansions staff begins a 
threehour behindthescenes race to transform the mansion into the 
bushs new home 
president reagan at his last official function on thursday 
joked about his impending move telling an east room luncheon group 
to stick around were having a tag sale upstairs and everything 
has to go 
and bush poked fun at his wife this week for ordering him to 
shoulder some of their packing crates and commanding him to move 
this one over here 
but in reality the outgoing and incoming first couples have 
little to do with the shift the mansions domestic staff sees to it 
that the personal belongings are switched during the swearingin 
ceremonies and inaugural address 
when the president leaves the white house to go to capitol hill 
for the ceremony this is still his home james allen head 
usher of the executive mansion said in an interview and when the 
new president returns it is then his home with his things in 
place 
allen who oversees the mansion and its 93member staff 
described the frenetic shuffle as a very cutanddried job that 
has to be done in about three hours 
as their final social duty on friday the reagans will treat the 
bushes as well as vice presidentelect dan quayle and his wife 
marilyn to a 1030 am coffee in the blue room of the executive 
residence 
the reagans then depart the white house for the last time as the 
nations first couple after bushs swearingin they are slated to 
travel by helicopter from capitol hill to andrews air force base 
outside washington from whence they will fly to los angeles 
until friday the bushes stay at blair house the newly renovated 
presidential guest quarters across the street from 1600 pennsylvania 
avenue 
allen said his job has been made easier this year because mrs 
reagan had most of the departing couples furniture packed up and 
sent in october to their california residence 
the head usher said that since the reagans have primarily only 
clothing and some small personal items remaining in the house the 
mansion is nearly completely furnished and ready for the bushes 
they really only need to put their clothes in the drawers he 
said 
when mrs reagan removed her red upholstered furniture from the 
second floor living room other pieces were taken from the white 
house supply held in a warehouse in virginia and put in place said 
elaine crispen mrs reagans press secretary 
believe me the bushes wont be sitting on orange crates mrs 
reagan has made every effort to find things in the white house 
collection that they could be happy with from the moment they walk 
in the door on inauguration day mrs crispen said 
last week a visitor to the private quarters could see that the 
elegant rooms were in perfect order with some pale upholstered 
furniture in place and the walls and tables adorned with artworks 
and antique china pieces from the white house collections 
mrs bush following a tour of the residence with mrs reagan 
last week called herself very lucky nancy reagan has set up such 
a beautiful house that all i have to do is move in and say ditto 
it was perfect 
mrs bush said that besides their dog millie their kingsized 
bed and a few curtains she intends to move in some of their living 
room furniture the staff will move the larger pieces of furniture 
next week said mrs crispen 
allen said a supply of oil paintings and a collection of small 
things like boehm birds vases and statues are available to help 
decorate 
its adequate but by no means complete allen said each 
family brings their own touches with them to make it their home 
the bushs sprawling seaside home in kennebunkport maine and 
their vice presidential residence are full of family pictures as 
well as mrs bushs needlepoint treasures and furniture from their 
stay in china all expected to find their way to the white house

heart disease patients who smoke are three times 
more likely to have chest pains and restricted blood flow to their 
hearts than those who dont light up researchers say in a study 
touted as the longsought smoking gun 
the finding is the first direct evidence linking cigarettes and 
heart disease said an editorial accompanying the study in fridays 
journal of the american medical association 
the data indicated smokers were more likely than nonsmokers to 
have angina or chest pains and painless periods of inadequate 
blood flow to the heart both called ischemic episodes the 
researchers said 
these episodes lasted longer among smokers whose median episode 
was 24 minutes compared to 2 minutes for nonsmokers the study 
said both frequency and duration increased as the number of 
cigarettes increased the study said 
ischemic episodes damage the heart temporarily and can lead to 
heart attacks said dr andrew selwyn a coauthor of the report and 
a cardiologist and associate professor at the harvard medical school 
the more they smoke in general the more ischemia they have and 
the greater their risk of heart attack and death selwyn said 
but the shortterm effects are reversible and very treatable 
and thats what makes it the study useful to show to patients and 
say look you havent damaged your heart yet so stop smoking 
now selwyn said in a telephone interview 
this is a solid piece of evidence you can show patients before 
they actually have a heart attack he said 
however gary miller a spokesman for the tobacco industrys 
washingtonbased tobacco institute disputed that view 
this is not really enough evidence to make such a claim he 
said in a telephone interview thursday noting the study involved 
only two dozen smokers fortyone nonsmokers also participated 
anything can cause these ischemic episodes caffeine 
excitement can cause them miller said 
the jama editorial said research on smoking and heart disease 
until now has been based on indirect evidence 
what had been lacking was a smoking gun linking the two 
wrote dr peter f cohn of the health sciences center of the state 
university of new york at stony brook 
the study based at brigham and womens hospital in boston was 
conducted in 198487 by attaching a monitor to the hearts of 24 
smokers and 41 nonsmokers all of whom had been diagnosed as having 
heart disease 
they wore the monitors for 24 hours while they went about their 
daily routines 
the monitors showed a total of 975 ischemic episodes 8 percent 
of which were accompanied by chest pains the study said the median 
number of episodes over 24 hours was three for smokers and one for 
nonsmokers 
what this did was show during the normal daily life the actual 
activity of your heart said joan barry a researcher at harvard 
and another author of the study patients walk around and have 
this abnormality and theyre not even aware of it

the state department on thursday cautiously 
welcomed soviet arms reduction announcements and said the north 
atlantic treaty organization would modernize its nuclear weapons 
nonetheless 
spokesman charles e redman also invited the soviets to provide 
more details on the announcements by president mikhail s gorbachev 
and foreign minister eduard a shevardnadze 
the us official said the warsaw pact has a numerical edge in 
nuclear weapons in europe and that assessing soviet troop reductions 
was difficult because moscow does not reveal much about its defense 
spending 
gorbachev told a group of western visitors on wednesday that 
soviet defense spending would be cut 142 percent and weapons 
production by 19 percent 
shevardnadze meanwhile informed a human rights conference in 
vienna that the soviets would withdraw some nuclear forces from 
eastern europe and not modernize weapons remaining there 
we welcome this announcement and look forward to receiving more 
details on the soviet plans redman said in response to the 
foreign minister 
he said nato had withdrawn 2400 nuclear weapons since 1969 and 
that the western alliances nuclear arsenal was at its lowest level 
in 20 years 
to date natos reductions have not been matched by the soviet 
union redman said we will follow with interest soviet 
implementation of this reduction 
the us official then added that nato would retain the minimum 
number of nuclear weapons needed to maintain the strategy of 
deterrence nothing has changed in that score 
redman stressed the nuclear weapons would be kept up to date 
he said you dont want to send people into war without equipment 
that works 
the statement clearly was intended to deflect any attempt by the 
soviets to stop the nato modernization program or to spur the 
elimination of all tactical nuclear weapons from europe 
the reagan administration has tried to hold the line within the 
alliance against disarmament tendencies some west germans for 
instance are intrigued by the prospect of eastwest negotiations to 
remove all nuclear missiles from their territory 
all us and soviet intermediaterange nuclear missiles with a 
range of 300 to 3000 miles are being scapped under a treaty 
signed here in december 1987 
redman said meanwhile the administration was studying 
gorbachevs announcement of reductions in defense spending and 
weapons production 
we will be watching how these reductions are implemented he 
said 
but the us official said its difficult at this stage to 
assess the actual significance without knowing more about the 
current soviet defense outlays and redman said the soviets have 
acknowledged all that data is not made public

benny oberrys sidebyside businesses in miamis 
liberty city section survived the 1980 and 1982 riots unscathed but 
tuesday night one of them a grocery operated by an arab family for 
a year was looted and burned to the brick 
theres no doubt about it if they had known i still own the 
building they would have never torched it said oberry a black 
businessman whose driving school next door was untouched they 
didnt realize it hurts me more than it hurts the arabs 
as the dust settled in liberty city and overtown shopkeepers in 
the predominantly black neighborhoods shoveled up debris and counted 
up their losses thursday 
business owners and a black community activist said it was clear 
blackowned businesses were spared and others specifically targeted 
during three nights of rioting 
while the fatal shooting of an unarmed black motorcyclist by an 
hispanic police officer monday set off the violence deeprooted 
racial tension in these impoverished areas fueled the riots those 
in the community said thursday 
the rioters picked their targets carefully they said sometimes 
even ransacking a store and destroying its cash registers and scales 
but leaving behind large stocks of beer wine and food 
sam bahhur whose palestinian family operated seven small food 
markets in overtown and liberty city watched with anger as 
customers streamed into the blackowned dobson grocery across the 
street from his ransacked store 
they were not hungry they just wanted to destroy he said 
while his son used a shovel to clean up a heap of canned goods 
cookies and panty hose packages 
we ran away from the uprising back home in palestine now we 
find this we ran away from persecution over there and we end up 
destroyed here where can a man run to bahhur asked 
six of the seven bahhur stores were damaged including the market 
in oberrys building that store was the only one on a block of 
other businesses all blackowned to be hit by the rioting youths 
bahhur estimated the familys losses in inventory and store 
fixtures along with structural damage at 3 million the family 
will rebuild if it can find the money he said 
city officials said overall structural damage from the rioting 
was less than 1 million 
across the street thomas dobson said his grocery was untouched 
by rioters not necessarily because he is black but because he 
stayed to protect it every night 
did they avoid black businesses that might have had some input 
into it another thing may be the way they treat people when they go 
in to stores he said 
black community activist georgia ayers agreed with business 
owners that the riots were more than just youths running wild 
everything was planned and targeted protect black businesses 
and get the white man the hispanic and the arab out of our 
community she said 
for oberry seeing destruction in his neighborhood of nearly 30 
years is painful 
i dont particularily think that solves the problem he said 
they thought theyd hurt the white and arab businesses but that 
thinking process is wrong it doesnt solve anything

a drifter who opened fire with an assault 
rifle on a crowded schoolyard killing five children of southeast 
asian refugees hated vietnamese immigrants and believed they were 
robbing nativeborn americans of jobs a former coworker said 
but police said today that patrick edward purdy who wounded 30 
others at cleveland elementary school before committing suicide 
tuesday hated everyone 
through his lifetime mr purdy developed a hate for 
everybody said police capt dennis perry who called the killer a 
loner with no friends no particularly known girlfriends 
purdy had a problem with alcohol a problem with marijuana and 
a distinct dislike for everybody not a particular race all of 
them perry said 
purdy was seething when he spoke about vietnamese workers 
recalled former coworker steve sloan 
he said he hated vietnamese sloan said in an interview in 
todays editions of the sacramento bee 
he seemed really frustrated because here he was being 
barely able to hold onto a job i got the impression that the guy 
had it in for other minority people because theyre able to come 
into our country said sloan who said he spoke with purdy at 
numeri tech a stockton machine shop where the killer worked for a 
few months early last year 
the bee also reported that purdy tried to commit suicide in jail 
in 1987 and was described in a subsequent mental health report as 
a danger to his health and others 
purdy was carrying a book about the white supremicist group aryan 
nations when he was arrested for firing a 9mm browning semiautomatic 
pistol at trees near lake tahoe in april 1987 the newspaper 
reported 
he told an el dorado county sheriffs deputy that it was his 
duty to help the suppressed and to overthrow the suppressor 
according to arrest reports cited by the paper 
once in jail purdy made a rope out of strips of his shirt tried 
to hang himself but was discovered he then tried to cut his wrists 
the newspaper said 
in a subsequent mental health report purdy was described as 
dangerous and suffering from mild mental retardation the bee 
also reported authorities say purdy had a long criminal record 
a woman who called herself purdys best friend said the killer 
whose clothes and guns bore radical islamic slogans was prone to 
bleak moods where he didnt want to live 
he had a bizarre attitude kind of paranoid said kelley 
riley 25 described by residents as purdys frequent companion in 
late 1987 and early 1988 he wanted to make it on his own as a 
welder but he couldnt hed get upset at things hed get mad at 
himself 
however she said purdy was nice most of the time would 
just walk away when he was mad was never violent toward anyone 
and never demonstrated an unusual interest in guns 
authorities concede they may never know why purdy wearing a flak 
jacket returned to the school of his youth 
purdy who police said was either 24 or 26 parked his station 
wagon behind the school and set it ablaze with a molotov cocktail 
before entering the campus during midday recess 
after firing up to 110 shots from a bayonetequipped 
chinesemade ak47 assault rifle at hundreds of youngsters he 
killed himself with a single pistol bullet to the head 
a 6yearold boy remained in serious condition and 17 pupils and 
a teacher were in stable condition the others wounded were treated 
at hospitals or at the scene and were released 
officials said purdys olivedrab shirt bore the iranian battle 
cry death to the great satin sic plo and the words 
libya and earthman 
carved into the stock of the assault rifle was the word 
hezbollah the name of the radical shiite moslem faction 
believed holding american hostages in lebanon also carved into the 
rifle were the words freedom and victory 
we still do not have a complete picture perry said why he 
did this we may never know we can only assume that some problem 
came up in this guy that made him do it obviously he had a 
military hangup 
psychologists urged parents to bring their children back to the 
cleveland elementary school on wednesday and deal with the trauma 
immediately through counseling the night before workers washed the 
blood from the pavement patched the bullet holes and replaced 
shattered windows 
however only 227 of the schools 975 pupils returned wednesday 
said principal pat busher 
the kids are great and they are very resilient she said 
parents and their children most of them refugees from southeast 
asia were greeted by bouquets atop the school sign on the front 
lawn and five red roses at its base across the street a 
3by9foot paper sign read racists are ugly lets stop them 
i still feel upset but i have to bring my kid to see the 
teacher to let the teacher know my kids all right brom lee said 
in broken english everybodys angry your kid there you get 
angry too 
his 7yearold daughter nary said she was scared to return 
because i saw blood 
holding tightly to her fathers hand she said she saw a 
schoolmate felled by a bullet i saw somebody get shot right 
here she said pointing to her leg 
the police captain said purdy lived in a room at the el rancho 
motel in the days leading up to the bloodbath in the room officers 
found a bizarre collection of items including a broken 22caliber 
rifle about 100 plastic toy soldiers and an olive drab cloth on 
which were drawn in black three snarlingtype faces and the 
words v for victory and f for freedom perry said

riot police beat protesters with 
clubs thursday and formed human cordons to drive 2000 people from 
wenceslas square where activists demanding more human rights have 
rallied five straight days 
more than a dozen protesters were beaten badly and at least 10 
were dragged away by police during a melee that broke out after 
authorities shouted through loudspeakers that the rally was 
unauthorized 
it was the most violent clash between protesters and police since 
the gatherings began sunday 
the crowd had been chanting slogans demanding broader freedoms in 
the communistruled nation but those slogans changed to gestapo 
gestapo when the batonwielding wave of riot police swept 
through lashing out indiscriminately 
officers linked arms to form human chains and push the protesters 
out of the square 
mayor vdenek horcik appealed for the provocations to stop in 
an address on national television which appeared after the main 
evening news horcik urged parents and teachers to keep young people 
off the streets and said the police action was necessary to maintain 
order 
the crowd assembled shortly after 5 pm when many prague 
residents were on their way home after work they shouted free 
havel and let them go referring to human rights activist 
vaclav havel and 14 others jailed for taking part in earlier 
protests 
hundreds of officers poured into the halfmilelong square from 
sidestreets when the protesters refused to leave charging the crowd 
and pushing them along the boulevard 
police vans and ambulances with sirens blaring arrived to help 
force away the demonstrators water cannons were brought onto the 
square but not used 
the demonstrations began sunday when about 5000 people gathered 
at wenceslas square for a memorial to jan palach who burned himself 
to death 20 years ago to protest the presence of soviet troops after 
the 1968 warsaw pact invasion 
troops and tanks sent in by the kremlin in august 1968 crushed 
the prague spring reforms which now are likened to the social and 
economic changes championed by soviet president mikhail s gorbachev 
some protesters yelled gorbachev sees this when police moved 
in thursday 
on sunday monday and tuesday police used water cannons dogs 
truncheons and tear gas to break up rallies about 5000 
demonstrators gathered again wednesday night but police did not 
interfere 
the more tolerant treatment was seen as the result of criticism 
by western officials attending a human rights conference in vienna 
czechoslovakia was one of 35 nations that agreed sunday at the 
meeting to a broad package of rights and freedoms and its 
leadership drew fire for breaking up sundays peaceful demonstration 
within an hour of the accords adoption 
members of the charter 77 human rights group sent a letter 
thursday to czechoslovakias prime minister ladislav adamec 
demanding that jailed dissidents be freed and officials be more 
tolerant of public expression 
vaclav maly of charter 77 said fellow activist martin palous was 
detained by police at his home around noon palous addressed 
wednesdays rally reading a charter 77 protest of the earlier 
arrests 
maly also said a prosecutor informed activists that havel 
czechoslovakias bestknown dissident faces hooliganism charges he 
said the crime carries a maximum twoyear jail sentence 
at least five other activists have been told they also will face 
criminal charges for their roles in the demonstrations charter 77 
members said 
communist authorities accused dissidents and the western media of 
fomenting the unrest 
the communist party daily rude pravo said that on wednesday 
night a cluster of about 1000 people in the upper half of 
wenceslas square made the usual everyday traffic impossible 
the purpose of this unauthorized gathering was also this time 
evident from chanted slogans attacking the socialist system and its 
leading representative rude pravo said 
in another development former foreign minister jiri hajek a 
member charter 77 was denied permission to visit west germany for 
the 75th birthday of his friend former chancellor willy brandt 
hajek who was allowed to visit austria last month said prague 
authorities deemed it against state interests for him to travel 
abroad

well were very optimistic 
hunt said scrutiny of the plans being carried out by a joint 
team of specialists from the institute and the pentagons national 
security agency had started tuesday 
were still receiving some plans most of them have come in 
most of the agencies have sent their submissions and we are 
proceeding with the review he said 
hunt said he did not yet have a count of the specific number of 
computer security plans submitted so far but said it was in the 
thousands 
drafting review and implementation of new security plans for 
computers handling sensitive but unclassified data were among steps 
including improved training programs for computer users mandated 
under the computer security act signed into law last year by 
president reagan 
the legislation came in the wake of increased concern over 
vulnerability of government computer systems to socalled computer 
viruses and other threats 
in a report released last september the general accounting 
office an arm of congress said federal agencies at that time had 
identified 53443 computer systems an estimated 52000 of them 
within the defense department containing sensitive data 
however hunt said he did not expect the number of security plans 
submitted for review to reach that high because agencies are being 
permitted to group together similar computer systems under a single 
plan 
he said the team reviewing the plans now includes 16 specialists 
and was expected to peak this spring at about 30 people the 
institute is spending about 15 million on the effort he said 
we are planning on completing the review at the latest by the 
end of may then we will be wrapping up with a final report 
summaries and stuff in june hunt said

about 2000 people protesting the 
us military presence in the philippines marched toward the gates 
of clark air base on thursday but riot police and thousands of 
residents blocked their way 
about 2000 residents massed at the main gate of the us base 
hours before the protesters who oppose nuclear weapons they say are 
kept by us forces arrived from manila 
scantily clad bar girls danced and chanted or waved signs with 
slogans directed at opponents of the bases some of the signs read 
leave us alone us bases yes pullout no and we love 
our job retain the bases 
most of the 200000 residents of angeles depend for their 
livelihood on income from the base primarily on spending by its 
26000 us personnel and dependents 
the antius demonstrators were blocked by dozens of jeeps left 
by police and local residents about 300 yards from the base about 
1000 riot police manned a bigger barricade of trucks about 100 
yards from the main entrance 
police said they set up the barricades to keep apart the two 
rival groups after receiving reports that local residents and 
rightwing extremists planned to disrupt the antius rally 
after two hours of negotiations police allowed base opponents to 
march to a park about 100 yards from the base for an overnight 
rally the group was to travel to the us navy base at subic bay 30 
miles to the southwest for a similar rally friday 
while base opponents were en route from manila on thursday armed 
soldiers searched each of the more than 150 vehicles at three 
checkpoints one officer said the troops were ordered to search for 
weapons and rightwing elements who might have joined the group to 
create trouble 
this is plain and simple harassment said philippine rep 
gregorio andolana who was taking part in the antius protest 
opposition to the bases runs strong both in the population and in 
congress 
the senate must approve any extension of the lease agreement for 
the six us installations the pact expires in 1991 
also thursday communist rebels warned they were ready to launch 
new attacks on us military bases in the philippines 
a regional branch of the national democratic front a marxist 
umbrella group said in a statement that rebel forces are in a 
position to launch action armed and unarmed legal and illegal 
directly aimed at the us bases 
in october 1987 rebels mounted simultaneous ambushes outside 
clark killing three us servicemen and a filipino

voters in this british colony will go to 
the polls in feburary for the first time in more than three years 
premier john swan announced thursday in a call for early general 
elections 
he set the feb 9 election date after weeks of speculation that 
he wanted to extend the term he first won in 1983 
in the last general election in 1985 swans governing united 
bermuda party took 31 of 40 seats in the assembly the partys 
largest majority ever 
the governments support has eroded as a result of several recent 
problems including overspending on work at bermudas airport and a 
controversial plan to build a trashburning plant 
swan could wait until 1990 to schedule elections but the premier 
apparently believes he would have a better chance of winning if they 
are called quickly

a soviet icebreaker dispatched to rescue north pole 
researchers from a drifting ice floe north of greenland failed to 
cut its way through to them leaving the scientists stranded tass 
reported thursday 
the icebreaker rossiya will try again bypassing the 
impregnable wall of ice and circling around to attempt a 
breakthrough from the north tass said quoting a report from the 
ship radioed to the northern soviet port of murmansk 
the rescue operation was mounted after the ice floe under soviet 
research station north pole28 was caught in a warm current and 
began drifting southward and thawing according to the official news 
agency 
tass said the floe could no longer accommodate a rescue plane so 
the rossiya was sent sunday to try to pick up the researchers tass 
did not say how many scientists were at the station or when the 
rossiya would make its next attempt to reach them 
tass indicated that authorities had decided to abandon the 
drifting station which it said had been conducting research in a 
poorly explored area north of greenland 
it was decided that the otto shmidt research ship will later 
subsitute for the north pole28 station tass said with the 
help of an icebreaker the vessel will be frozen into the ice and 
will then drift with it for several months

president reagan authorized american oil 
companies on thursday to resume doing business in libya in a bid to 
head off the potential nationalization of their huge investment in 
that country 
the move also is designed to put an end to what a white house 
statement called the significant windfall profits libya has 
reaped since the administration imposed the ban on the us 
operations there in 1986 
in the absence of the american firms libyans have been working 
the us oil fields and keeping the income 
the white house and the state department both said that reagans 
decision does not constitute any softening of us sanctions against 
libya 
these include a trade embargo and a freeze on libyan assets in 
the united states state department spokesman charles redman said 
these restrictions will prevent the oil companies from sending any 
goods between the united states and libya 
the announcement which came on reagans last full day in office 
seemed designed to spare the bush administration a similar decision 
if the announcement had been left to the incoming administration 
it could have left the impression among some that presidentelect 
bush and secretary of statedesignate james a baker iii were 
showing favoritism toward oil interests both had been involved in 
that business in texas 
asked whether the timing of the announcement was politically 
motivated redman said only that the review of us policy had been 
under way since last summer 
the companies affected are occidential petroleum marathon oil 
conoco petroleum w r grace and amerada hess their investments in 
libya are believed to total in the hundreds of millions of dollars 
before the embargo went into effect libya received 51 percent of 
the revenues derived from the us oil operations 
when the administration imposed broad trade sanctions against 
libya in 1986 it authorized the companies to negotiate 
standstill agreements with libya 
the agreements which expire on june 30 provided for the 
suspension of company operations to protect the firms from charges 
of default on their contractual obligations to work their 
concessions in libya 
the companies have been concerned that libyan leader moammar 
gadhafi might seize their assets if the agreement expires and the 
sanctions are not lifted 
this decision does not represent a change in the attitude of 
the us government toward libya redman said our view remains 
unaltered libya still supports terrorism and subversion 
it continues to act against the united states and the west the 
chemical weapons factory it has built constitutes a regional menace 
and no improvement in us relations can be possible without 
concrete and durable change in libyas behavior 
in a similar vein white house spokesman marlin fitzwater said 
we remain deeply concerned about gadhafis continued support for 
terrorism and subversion as well as libyan efforts to develop a 
chemical weapons capability 
redman said the announcement will permit the oil companies to 
resume their operations in libya transfer operations to foreign 
subsidiaries or sell their assets if they so desire 
with a trade embargo and strict restraints on travel by americans 
to libya in effect redman said the us firms could use third 
country nationals and third country goods in their libyan operations

scientists have discovered genetic signposts that 
will allow diagnosis of elephant mans disease before symptoms 
appear and even before birth a foundation that deals with the 
disorder announced thursday 
that will allow earlier treatment to reduce severity of the 
disease a hereditary disorder that afflicts at least 100000 
americans authorities said 
doctors also will be able to rule out the disease early bringing 
relief to a family 
its going to usher in a new era in us being able to provide 
services of various types for people with this disorder said 
allan rubenstein medical director of the national neurofibromatosis 
foundation 
the disease called neurofibromatosis 1 strikes in about one in 
every 4000 live births 
the illness causes tumors to grow anywhere in the nervous system 
and can lead to severe disfigurement deafness blindness brain 
cancer and spinal deformity some 40 percent to 60 percent of 
patients also suffer learning disabilities 
the disease gained its nickname from a disfigured 19thcentury 
englishman who exhibited himself at sideshows as the elephant man 
but since then researchers have determined he actually had a 
different disease 
early signs of the disease often are noticed shortly after birth 
but in about a quarter of all cases a diagnosis cannot be confirmed 
until adolescence when other symptoms appear said rubenstein 
in addition he said about 10 percent of neurofibromatosis cases 
lack classic symptoms so that no definite diagnosis can be made 
that poses a problem as a person approaches childbearing years and 
wants to know if he or she carries the faulty gene which can be 
passed on to a child rubenstein said 
while prenatal diagnosis allows the possibility of an abortion 
most people with neurofibromatosis live a normal life without 
serious medical problems said john carey associate professor of 
pediatrics at the university of utah 
about half of neurofibromatosis cases come from inheriting the 
faulty gene while the other half occur spontaneously testing based 
on the new discovery will be possible only in families in which the 
disease has already appeared 
researchers followed up on a 1987 discovery that the gene causing 
the disorder lay somewhere within a portion of chromosome 17 one of 
the 23 versions of threadlike structures that carry human 
hereditary information 
the new work narrows down the location of the gene to about 5 
percent of the chromosome the genetic signposts called markers 
lie close to the gene on each side 
the markers are valuable because they tend to be inherited along 
with the gene so if they are found on a persons chromosome 17 he 
has a high probability of carrying the neurofibromatosis gene 
the markers will be useful in an estimated 80 percent to 90 
percent of families that have had a case of neurofibromatosis 
rubenstein said in those families the markers should enable early 
diagnosis with at least 95 percent accuracy he said 
once the gene itself is isolated a more general screening test 
will be possible researchers say 
the findings are reported in the january issue of the american 
journal of human genetics by a consortium of researchers led by 
francis collins of the university of michigan bernd seizinger of 
harvard medical school and bruce ponder of royal marsden hospital in 
england

some inauguration celebrants have had their 
ball gowns delivered by federal express others simply must have the 
perfect table at the perfect time and theres always the worry 
about what to do between events 
welcome to inaugural week in washington where highroller 
republicans and parties for them are aplenty 
i guess well be going to some parties here san francisco 
banking executive don stephens said calmy upon arriving in the 
capital an understatement in a week overflowing with festivities 
by thursday those with energy as well as money were well into 
party mode 
after the opening ceremony were going to eat and then to a new 
jersey reception but well see you tonight at union station or back 
at the hotel afterward one minkdraped woman told another 
wednesday in a conversation overheard in a hotel lobby where the 
wellheeled are easy to find these days 
they also can be found in the choice seats at inaugural events 
or the choice restaurants or the choice clothing stores which 
report high demand for formal gowns from those who didnt bring 
enough and cant be seen in the same one twice 
i called home and had my daughter send me this because i looked 
at the schedule and realized i needed another one said a woman 
who got federal express involved in the overnight gowndelivery 
business oh god no id be too embarrassed she said when 
asked her name confessing only that home was california and her 
next stop was the hotels valet desk to inquire about having the 
gown pressed 
keeping high rollers happy is a top priority of the republican 
national committee which is trying to take care f those who 
bankrolled the 1988 campaign 
the rnc held a dinnerdance tuesday night for its leaders and top 
contributors welcoming them to washington a night before the formal 
inaugural events began 
since then the celebration has been virtually nonstop for in 
the words of one gop fundraiser those of us who paid so 
generously in advance 
there was the kickoff ceremony at the lincoln memorial and the 
first round of dinners wednesday and another full day of events 
thursday including a salute to the new first lady barbara bush 
and vice president dan quayle and a starstudded gala to be 
attended by presidentelect bsuh as well as his wealthy supporters 
the rnc also has arranged a number of private receptions to keep 
its favorite guests entertained between official inaugural events 
and many are organizing smaller dinner parties and private 
receptions 
the ritzcarlton ordered 5000 ounces of choice caviar to please 
the palates of its guests this week 
and when the affluent eat out they expect royal treatment 
you have to use your intuition your imagination said maitre 
d martin garbisu of the ritzs exclusive jockey club you dont 
want to create bad feelings 
cosmetics queen estee lauder and wall street takeover king henry 
kravis were among this weeks visitors to the jockey club where the 
most frequent request has been for a table in the front section 
the most visible people will do anything said garbisu smiling 
as his voice trailed off 
there have been a few glitches amid the glamor 
limousines are scarcer than scarce guests had to scramble for 
unassigned seats despite paying 1500 a plate for dinner wednesday 
night and tickets to some of the highprofile events are 
nonexistent even for high rollers with invitations 
indeed a special trouble room at the washington convention 
center for those with ticket problems was packed with grumbling 
republicans on thursday 
they dont like lines and they especially dont like standing 
in line only to be told sorry one inaugural organizer said 
these are people who are treated like kings in their home states 
but weve got a lot of people to look out for here and not all of 
them are too happy right now

yugoslavia chose a new premier 
thursday who believes a combination of marketoriented reform and 
political change is the answer to the economic and social crisis 
the collective presidencys choice of ante markovic was a clear 
victory for liberal refomist elements of the ruling communist party 
over the consaervative dogmatic faction 
it also was seen as a rebuke to slobodan milosevic communist 
party chief of serbia yugoslavias largest republic who had put up 
a serbian candidate in competition 
markovic whose appointment must be approved by parliament is a 
64yearold electrical engineer and member of the national partys 
policymaking central committee 
the ninemember presidency told markovic to start forming a 
cabinet as soon as possible the official news agency tanjug 
reported 
he will succeed branko mikulic whose government resigned dec 30 
because it could not solve such economic problems as high 
unemployment annual inflation of 250 percent and a 21 billion 
foreign debt 
a decline in the living standard to half what it was when 
president tito died in 1980 has caused widespread discontent among 
workers a record 1400 strikes were reported last year 
mikulics was the first national government to step down since 
tito and the communists gained power after world war ii 
tanjug did not give a vote count among the nine members of the 
presidency in the contest between mikulic and serbian candidate 
borisav jovic a close associate of milosevic 
the new premier has long advocated simultaneous economic and 
political reform in yugoslavia a federation of six diverse 
republics he had the strong support of croatia and slovenia the 
most economically advanced and westwardlooking regions 
reforms mikulic initiated late last year which markovic is 
expected to implement allow more investment of domestic and foreign 
private capital sale of stocks and bonds and changes in the banking 
system along western lines 
jovic an economist and speaker of the serbian parliament had 
support from poorer regions that fear economic reform could lead to 
closure of moneylosing industries and mass layoffs of workers 
serbia had said the job should go to its candidate because there 
had not been a serbian premier in 22 years 
milosevic appeared defiant thursday when he spoke at a party 
conference in the province of vojvodina defending recent mass 
rallies in serbia widely believed to have been organized by his own 
supporters 
the protests strained the nations fragile ethnic balance for six 
months and led to the ouster of many opponents of the serbian party 
chief 
during the party meeting thursday broadcast live on television 
milosevic said no solution to the national difficulties was possible 
without the political liquidation of those who have created 
the crisis

president reagan said thursday he was 
frustrated over his inability to free americans held hostage in 
lebanon and conceded a day before leaving office we dont know 
where they are 
even to the end of his presidency reagan said officials were 
continuing to explore quietly and privately how to win freedom 
for the nine americans there hasnt been a moment that this isnt 
on our minds he said 
we know that any overt attempt at rescue even if we did have a 
hint or a clue about their whereabouts could run the risk of 
their assassination or execution before we could get them out he 
told reporters for the associated press and other news services 
reagan also said in the wideranging interview that 
he contines to believe us arms sales to iranian elements in 
1985 and 1986 did not constitute an attempt to trade arms for the 
hostages held by proiranian lebanese kidnappers viewing the sale 
as an attempted swap amounted he said to a total media 
distortion 
he stil feels former white house aides oliver l north and john 
m poindexter will be found innocent of criminal wrongdoing in 
connection with the arms deal he seemed to rule out granting 
pardons for either man before leaving office at noon friday saying 
that to do so would leave them forever after with that guilt 
hanging over them 
he has high confidence in george bushs ability to handle 
ussoviet relations 
as to the hostages reagan said their situation did not parallel 
that of the 52 americans freed from captivity the day he took 
office jan 20 1981 after 444 days as prisoners in iran 
during the 1980 campaign against jimmy carter reagan criticized 
the president for being unable to win their release 
reagan had criticized carters handling of the hostagetaking at 
the us embassy in tehran as too sluggish and had said on jan 
7 1980 
i believe its appropriate to suggest that anything that has 
been done by the administration so far could have should have 
been done in the first hour 
in thursdays interview reagan declined to take back the 
criticism 
we were facing two very different situations he said noting 
that in the earlier situation more than 50 people had been taken 
prisoner in the embassy and had been kidnapped by the government of 
iran 
on the other hand he said the americans held in lebanon were 
kidnapped individually by terrorists 
nine americans are prisoners associated press chief middle east 
correspondent terry anderson has held the longest since march 16 
1985 
on the question of us dealings with soviet president mikhail s 
gorbachev reagan said he thought bush would move forward on the 
issue of reducing the superpower stockpiles of longrange nuclear 
weapons but that caution should be used 
i think we have to realize that in these negotiations 
theyre not just based on what someone says theyre based on deeds 
and i think that george bush will be very prepared there based on 
what the deeds are 
reagan said he does not believe he is less popular in europe than 
soviet president mikhail s gorbachev as some polls have said 
i cant quite accept that hes more popular than i am reagan

it was two years ago friday that anglican 
church emissary terry waite left his beirut hotel to negotiate the 
release of american hostages and disappeared presumably becoming a 
hostage himself 
what happened on his fifth mercy mission remains a mystery but 
other western hostages freed since he vanished have reported seeing 
a man in an underground prison they believed was the 6foot7 waite 
new rumors crop up almost every week he was killed trying to 
escape shiite moslem extremists who held him he was smuggled to 
iran in a coffin to stand trial as an american spy he will be 
ransomed for 7 million 
no group has claimed to hold waite the british government which 
refuses to negotiate with terrorists says no demands have been 
made no photographs or videotapes have been released to prove he is 
alive 
a british official said recently we believe waite is alive 
simply because weve had no evidence to the contrary 
fifteen foreigners are missing in lebanon including nine 
americans most of them believed held by shiites loyal to iran 
one of the americans on whose behalf waite had intended to 
negotiate has been held longest terry a anderson 41 chief 
middle east correspondent of the associated press he was kidnapped 
march 16 1985 
the 49yearold personal envoy of the archbishop of canterbury is 
one of four britons among the missing two seen grabbed by gunmen in 
beirut journalist john mccarthy and teacher brian keenan who has 
british and irish nationality also disappeared with no claims of 
abduction 
irans recent effort to improve relations with britain and other 
western nations after a decade of selfimposed isolation has raised 
hopes it will seek to have the hostages freed 
waites cousin john waite said wednesday in a cbstv interview 
what were hoping is that president bush can put the hostage 
question right to the top of his agenda 
presidentelect george bush who takes office friday said this 
week he does not believe iran controls the lebanese kidnap gangs but 
believes improved relations could help bush said his administration 
would seek ways to free the hostages 
president reagan acknowledged thursday that he leaves office 
without a hint or a clue about the american hostages 
sources in the middle east who have been wellinformed on earlier 
hostage releases report no significant movement toward more releases 
soon 
waite the policemans son who became the personal emissary of 
archbishop of canterbury robert runcie was seen leaving the seaside 
riviera hotel in moslem west beirut at 730 pm on jan 20 1987 
to meet with shiite kidnappers 
he told his druse bodyguards he did not want them to escort him 
to the clandestine meeting whose site he did not disclose 
sources said waite was driven to the home of a shiite physician 
who acted as middleman where he apparently was to make contact with 
islamic jihad a shiite faction holding anderson and thomas 
sutherland another american captive 
according to the sources it was in the physicians house that 
the fate he often feared became reality waite himself was taken 
hostage 
walid jumblatt leader of the the druse militia guarding waite 
accused the hezbollah or party of god of holding waite but the 
shiite fundamentalist group denied it 
on thursday he appealed for waites release in an interview 
broadcast by lebanons state television 
i do not think that terry waite is that big a spy we should 
emerge from this whirlpool of hostage taking he said without 
elaborating 
hezbollah is believed to be an umbrella organization for shiite 
kidnappers including islamic jihad whose name means islamic holy 
war 
lebanese officials and some western sources believe waites 
position was compromised by disclosure of the reagan 
administrations armsforhostages deal with tehran 
three american captives held by islamic jihad were freed after 
us weapons were delivered to iran in 198586 during its war with 
iraq until the us dealings with tehran were disclosed in november 
1986 waite was credited with obtaining their freedom 
other reports say islamic jihad decided to make waite a captive 
because it held him responsible for kuwaits refusal to free 17 
proiranians imprisoned there for bombing the us and french 
embassies and other targets in 1983 their freedom had been the 
groups main demand

george bush on the eve of his inauguration as 
the nations 41st president said today he would use his address on 
friday to urge americans to pitch in and help 
he also spoke of his optimism about the future but also expressed 
his feeling that president reagans shoes are going to be pretty 
darn hard to fill 
bush told a group of top high school students his mission was 
to help build a better america and he asked for their help 
the presidentelect who was to spend most of the day out of the 
public eye until his appearance at a nationally televised evening 
gala said at a youth inaugural forum i really feel this our 
best days are yet to come 
in a midday interview with news service reporters he said his 
inaugural address on friday would include a broad appeal to the 
american people to pitch in and help it will be an expression of 
satisfaction about how far weve come as a nation and a recognition 
that weve got a long way to go 
he said the speech would be broad and thematic and not 
contain many specifics 
bush said in the interview that he had no plans for a first 100 
days initiative with congress calling that a concept that 
really doesnt apply to a vice president stepping up to the top 
job 
he also was to bid a private farewell today to the man who he 
said helped make it all possible 
it wont be too easy bush said of what could be his final 
private moment with reagan before taking the oath of office 
reagan himself said today that he is leaving office without a 
hint or a clue as to the whereabouts of americans held hostage in 
lebanon 
in a farewell interview with news service reporters reagan said 
that while he feels badly about the hostages the situation should 
not be likened to the one when he came to office eight years ago 
fiftytwo americans held in tehran were released on jan 20 1981 
the same day that reagan was inaugurated and president carter left 
reagan had harshly criticized carter during the 1980 campaign for 
failing to win the hostages release 
this week the focus of the nations leadership was already 
beginning to shift to bush as he headlined events leading up to the 
friday ceremony 
some of his time today was to be spent rehearsing his 15minute 
inaugural address spokeswoman alixe glen said 
meanwhile barbara bush the presidentelects wife won cheers 
and laughter today from audiences that packed three theater halls to 
hear her joke about her appearance and her husbands fishing 
mrs bush stepped out from behind one podium and told her 
audience please notice hairdo makeup designer dress look 
at me good this week and remember you may never see it again 
she also made fun of her husbands comments on how tough it has 
been for him to pack for the move to the white house noting he 
spent two days fishing last week in florida mrs bush said so 
much to the packing story 
the students bush addressed today cheered when he said our 
american optimism about the future is legendary and perhaps no one 
better personifies that than a president named ronald reagan whose 
shoes are going to be pretty darn hard to fill 
i cant predict all the twists and the turns that youll see in

the government thursday said it had 
indications libya may be planning to conduct research into 
biological weapons at a planned institute for microbiology 
the chief government spokesman friedhelm ost made the 
announcement late thursday but said there was no evidence to confirm 
it he also said there was no evidence west germans were linked to 
the planned institute 
the location of the proposed institute was not given 
there are indications that libya could also be intending to 
carry out biological weapons research there ost said he did not 
elaborate 
earlier thursday a leading member of parliament called for an 
investigation of a report that west germans east germans and cubans 
were involved in operation of a biological weapons plant in iraq 
ost confirmed the government had received information such a 
plant may be operating in iraq but said there was no immediate 
indication west german technicians or scientists were involved 
wilfried penner a member of the parliamentary control commission 
for intelligence services said he called for a meeting of the 
commission to investigate a television news report linking cuba 
west germany and east germany with the suspected iraqi plant 
the report on rtlplus television wednesday came as controversy 
continued over the suspected involvement of west german companies in 
helping libya build a disputed facility outside its capital tripoli 
libya says the plant will produce pharmaceuticals but us 
officials say it is intended to produce chemical weapons 
penner of the main opposition social democratic party told the 
associated press he called for the meeting only in part because of 
the rtlplus television report 
the rtlplus report broadcast from luxembourg said scientists 
and technicians from the federal republic west germany have 
constructed a factory for biological weapons in iraq 
the report said the plant is at salman fag 30 miles southeast of 
bagdad it said west german scientists and bacteriologists from east 
germany and cuba were involved and that the plant produces weapons 
that can spread deadly cholera anthrax and typhoid 
according to the tv report bacteria for the biological weapons 
are produced in secret underground laboratories protected by 
sovietbuilt missiles 
intelligence sources believe that rockets for delivery of the 
biological weapons were built by german technicians the report said 
in frankfurt prosecutor jochen schroers said he was not aware of 
the report 
schroers office is investigating the nowdefunct ibi 
engineering company owned by iraqi businessman ihsan barbouti to 
determine if it was involved in helping build the disputed libyan 
plant 
the imhausenchemie firm based in lahr west germany also is 
under investigation in connection with alleged involvement with the 
libyan plant imhausen allegedly played a key role in supplying 
material and knowhow for the facility

the navy on thursday suspended two private 
consultants and their companies from receiving or working on new 
federal contracts in connection with an ongoing probe of pentagon 
corruption 
the suspensions were ordered against william l parkin and his 
consulting firm crest inc and fred h lackner and his company 
acris associates 
the suspensions will prevent the men and their companies from 
contracting with any agency within the executive branch of the 
federal government pending the outcome of legal proceedings 
initiated against them the pentagon said in a statement 
the suspension orders also will prevent the two men and their 
firms from dealing with the federal government on behalf of other 
defense contractors the navy said 
thursdays action had been expected since jan 10 when the 
pentagon first announced that lackner parkin and several other 
companies and individuals were being considered for suspension as a 
result of a federal indictment and guilty pleas in the probe 
during the subsequent week the pentagon announced it had 
suspended the hazeltine corp a subsidiary of emerson electric co 
inc and the teledyne electronics division of teledyne industries 
inc the pentagon also suspended without pay a navy contracting 
official indicted in the case 
all of the actions flow from the jan 6 return of the first 
indictment in connection with the twoyear fraud investigation 
the probe which has been conducted over the last two years under 
the code name operation ill wind focuses on allegations that 
private consultants bribed government employees for information that 
gave client companies an edge in winning contracts 
the first indictment alleges that teledyne electronics and its 
employees paid parkin of alexandria va to obtain details about a 
navy radar contract worth more than 100 million parkin then paid 
lackner a consultant based in woodland hills calif who in turn 
gave bribes to stuart berlin a navy contracting officer the 
indictment asserts 
berlin parkin and lackner face maximum penalties of 185 years in 
prison and fines of 55 million each if convicted on all counts 
teledyne electronics faces a fine of 65 million if convicted 
all three men and the company have pleaded innocent to the 
charges a federal judge has set a trial date of march 27 
on the same day the indictment was returned the hazeltine corp 
agreed to plead guilty to conspiracy to defraud the united states 
conversion of government property and making false statements to the 
government 
affidavits released three weeks ago suggested that hazeltine also 
hired parkin to obtain inside information from pentagon employees 
that would allow the company to compete for a 159 million contract 
for electronic testing gear for an aircraft identification system

nato would welcome a unilateral 
reduction in the soviet unions shortrange nuclear missiles in 
eastern europe an official of the western military alliance said 
thursday 
robin stafford a spokesman for the north atlantic treaty 
organization said however the allies had to wait until the cuts 
were implemented to determine their significance 
in any event he said soviet superiority seems certain for 
some time 
soviet foreign minister eduard shevardnadze told the final 
session of a 35nation conference in vienna that moscow will 
withdraw some of its nuclear missiles from eastern europe the 
missiles he said will be pulled out along with troops who control 
them 
if this signals that in this field the soviets are now 
beginning to realize that their potential far exceeds legitimate 
requirements we can only find such steps encouraging stafford 
said 
us gen john r galvin natos top military commander in 
europe said if the soviets are serious about reducing tactical 
nuclear weapons they need to make significant cuts 
shevardnadzes speech came a day after soviet leader mikhail 
gorbachev said in moscow his program to slash his countrys armed 
forces by a halfmillion men would mean a reduction of 240000 
soviet soldiers in europe and 200000 in asia in the next two years 
gorbachev said the kremlins military budget will be trimmed by 
142 percent and the production of arms and military supplies by 
195 percent 
stafford responding to gorbachevs remarks said any 
indication that the soviet union is prepared to reduce its military 
spending and the overwhelming imbalance in existing weaponry is to 
be welcomed and encouraged 
he said however that the soviet union has never published 
figures on total military spending to speak therefore of 
percentages of an unknown figure gives a blurred picture which 
makes it difficult to calculate what the result would be if the cuts 
are in fact enacted stafford said 
we have made public our data for years galvin said it is 
about time the warsaw pact responded 
stafford also urged the soviet union to release it defense 
figures and provide additional details on its planned reductions 
still he said the statement of intent nevertheless augurs 
well for the atmosphere in which the coming round of arms 
negotiations will be held 
the accord signed in vienna by 35 nations including the united 
states canada and all european nations except albania mandates new 
eastwest negotiations on reducing conventional arms in europe 
those talks between the 16 nato nations and seven warsaw pact 
countries are to begin march 9 in vienna 
shevardnadze said in his speech that moscow has long offered to 
negotiate removal of its tactical nuclear weapons and promised to 
withdraw them from europe 
later at a news conference he said only shortrange weapons 
that are part of military units targeted for withdrawal will be 
removed and dismantled without conditions other tactical or 
battlefield weapons he said were subject to negotiations 
we would welcome the announced unilateral reduction by the 
soviet union of its large tactical nuclear force stafford said 
one of course has to wait to see how and if the announced steps 
are implemented to assess their actual importance 
he said the allies wanted to know which systems will be 
removed how many to where and what happens to them then 
galvin said that for talks on shortrange nuclear weapons to be 
held we need to achieve a parity in conventional forces first 
nato foreign ministers last month announced their position for 
the march negotiations known as conventional stability talks 
the western alliance says the soviets and their allies maintain 
imbalances that give them a large superiority in conventional forces 
in europe they want the east bloc to make much sharper reductions 
in their forces to bring the two sides to equality 
the allies also are expected to decide this spring whether to 
give a goahead to upgrading shortrange nuclear weapons in the 
western arsenal 
the issue has gained prominence since president reagan and 
gorbachev signed in december 1987 the intermediaterange nuclear 
forces treaty which provides for eliminating all us and soviet 
landbased missiles with ranges of 300 to 3400 miles

portugal and the united states agreed on 
new terms thursday for washingtons lease of a strategic air base in 
the azores a government official said 
justice minister fernando nogueira said portugal would receive a 
substantial package of military equipment and increased us 
cooperation in business health education and housing in return for 
continued use of the lajes base 
the countries have been negotiating new terms for the base on 
the azores island of terceira for almost a year 
diplomatic sources previously said the us side wanted to 
formalize an agreement before presidentelect george bush took 
office 
under the lajes accord first signed in 1951 us forces use the 
base as a refueling point for the air force and as a submarine 
warfare center in return washington grants portugal economic and 
military aid 
the agreement was revised in 1983 with the understanding there 
would be a rising trend in us assistance to portugal 
but fiscal 1988 saw 115 million in us aid flowing into lisbon 
compared with 117 million in 1987 and 208 million in 1985 
talks began last year after prime minister anibal cavaco silva 
worried about the decreasing aid formally requested a review of the 
accord 
this month washington announced it would increase aid to 
portugal to about 150 million 
although the increase is not formally linked to the base 
negotiations portuguese diplomatic sources have said they 
interpreted it as a gesture of good will 
after cavaco silva called for a revision to the accord 
government officials said they had asked the united states to equip 
their armed forces with f16 fighter bombers hawk missiles combat 
helicopters and other military hardware to offset the shortfall in 
aid since 1985

presidentelect bush challenged americas youth 
thursday to start thinking now about how to serve their country and 
help build a better america 
bush on the eve of his inauguration used wisecracks and wit to 
emphasize the importance of education as he addressed a crowd of 
5000 high school students at the dc armory 
i certainly learned the importance of education during the 
campaign i learned how vital it is to memorize dates pearl harbor 
day for example he said jokingly in reference to a campaign 
remark in which he misstated the date of the 1941 japanese attack on 
us forces in hawaii 
he prevented rep lynn martin rill from falling down a flight 
of steps leading to the stage but made a minor slip of his own as 
he joked about the harrison who delivered a notoriously long 
inaugural speech 
bush mixed up president benjamin harrison with his grandfather 
william henry the actual perpetrator of the prolix address 
ive been reading some history this week in preparation for the 
swearingin tomorrow and one thing ive learned is that george 
washingtons second inaugural address was exactly 134 words long so 
i want to take a lesson from that first george and try to keep these 
remarks pretty short the vice president said 
and then id want to do better than benjamin harrison did 
bush said i think he spoke for an hour and a half and then got 
pneumonia and died a few weeks later so ill try to do better than 
that tomorrow 
actually it was william henry harrison the ninth president who 
refused to wear a coat in the rain at his march 4 1841 inaugural 
and droned on through 8445 words a month later he became the 
first president to die in office benjamin harrison his grandson 
was the 23rd president from 18891893 
quoting franklin delano roosevelt he said we cant always 
build a future for our youth but we can build our youth for the 
future 
i cant predict all the twists and the turns that youll see in 
your lives nor can i as president prepare you for them but this i 
do pledge that i will do all in my power to help you help 
yourselves prepare for a brighter future bush said 
i ask that you begin now to think about how you can help your 
country think about how you can serve your country he said 
you see my mission truly is to help to reach out to help 
build a better america he said no president can do it without 
you 
bush spent much of the day at the white house working on the 
address he will deliver at noon friday and sitting for a round of 
media interviews he was heading out to a private dinner with 
relatives before an evening gala 
i really feel this our best days are yet to come and if we 
are to retain our place as a source of inspiration and hope for 
people everywhere we must be a nation that respects ideas and 
nourishes the ability of the people to develop and understand 
them bush told his young audience 
i do see a bettereducated america an america that respects 
teachers and the noble role they fill in our society an america 
that makes it easier for families to save for college an america 
that rewards excellence he said 
the teens cheered when bush said our american optimism about 
the future is legendary and perhaps no one better personifies that 
than a president named ronald reagan whose shoes are going to be 
pretty darn hard to fill 
asked afterwards by a reporter how he planned to answer bushs 
call to service doug metz 17 a senior from poolesville high 
school in maryland said join the army i guess 
yvette gissing 18 a senior from chantilly high school in 
virginia wondered if making people look good would help the 
country she wants to be a hairdresser 
stacey clark 16 a junior from la plata high school in maryland 
confessed that i didnt like bush at first i liked dukakis 
better 
i always thought that bush wanted things to be the same too 
much he didnt want change i wanted somebody who would change 
things said the teenager but now hes doing better

before this inauguration day is out a lot of 
people will come blinking into the sunlight of everyday life out of 
that warm and cozy cocoon of privilege and heady exhilaration that 
is life in the white house 
its a very odd and peculiar feeling says one man who 
experienced it eight years ago what the white house is is a 
fouryear adrenalin high you are working at absolutely maximum peak 
performance putting in 80 hours a week youve got to be alert 
every hour of the day theres no such thing as a day off or a 
vacation 
some medical people believe that a tracking of colds and flu 
cases will show a lopsided increase among government officials whose 
jobs ended with the outgoing administration says stu eizenstat 
you deadrenalize sort of like after a big race this is a 
fouryear sprint and when the sprint is over the body feels as its 
going to fall apart for a while 
eizenstat was assistant to the president for domestic affairs and 
policy in the carter administration 
a lawyer in private life he has become a passionate advocate of 
a britishstyle secretariat in the white house a cadre of 
professionals that would remain in place from administration to 
administration 
they are there to prevent the prime minister from stepping on 
any land mines eizenstat said we dont have anything like 
that we have total discontinuity 
his interest in establishing an americanstyle privy council was 
kindled in the two transitions he witnessed the carter coming in 
and the carter going out 
i had two meetings with my incoming counterpart martin 
anderson he recalls we talked about the same sorts of things i 
talked about with jim cannon who was my predecessor what bills 
are expiring that require authorization what are the immediate 
agenda items what hearings is congress likely to call 
he said told anderson he recognized that professional people 
would be replaced with reagan choices but that it would be wise to 
keep some secretaries because they are nonpolitical and know how 
the bureaucracy works 
i was told by the secretaries that a couple of days later they 
were asked how they voted eizenstat said those who did not say 
they voted for reagan were dismissed 
for the new staffer just going into the white house conveys a 
sense of being on top of the world eizenstat said but there also 
is the danger of developing a sense of hubris a certainty that you 
know more than anyone else or you wouldnt be there 
its bizarre coming in on the day of inauguration because its 
a different place you came in during the transition he said 
you come into what almost looks like a gorgeous mortuary there 
are no pictures and only a few holdover secretaries 
even with bush taing over from a president he served you have 
hardly any holdovers eizenstat said bush has a particularly 
delicate problem because a number of people in the white house and 
the administration view themselves not just as reagan people but as 
bush people who worked for him and voted for him 
for a staff member saying goodbye to the white house can be 
devastating eizenstat said his wife drove him to the passport 
office and he told her to circle the block and wait for him as he 
had done the four previous years with a chauffeur at his beck and 
call 
she said to me honey youre on your own take the metro 
home eizenstat said 
the washington post cited a similar rude awakening when john 
gavin ambassador to mexico from 1981 to 1986 was rushing to his 
first blacktie party after his return to private life he jumped 
into the back seat of his car only to realize there was no driver 
in front 
elaine crispen nancy reagans press secretary had one of the 
most prized perks of a white house employee she had a parking space 
close to the executive mansion in space no 5 
i said goodbye to no 5 today she said i love no 5 i 
didnt kiss it but i did say goodbye to it 
eizenstat said the most frustrating experience was learning to 
get to meetings on time waiting for taxis the same with tickets 
and squeezing into crowded subway cars 
caspar weinberger according to the post was surprised after he 
left his job as defense secretary by the experience of flying on 
commercial jets again they seat me next to people i dont even 
know quoted him as telling friends 
it takes a couple of months to come out of it when you are in 
a senior white house or a senior cabinet position you never have to 
worry about business people come to you you dont come to them 
as his white house life was ending eizenstat had a dream of what 
it would be like on his first day in private law practice i had a 
phone on the desk but no paper and no files i waited and for eight 
hours nothing happened no one rang no people came in 
he woke up in a cold sweat you can bet there are others doing 
the same thing today

thirteen letters written by russias greatest poet 
aleksandr pushkin are being returned to his homeland after decades 
of being kept in france and switzerland 
the soviet union bought the letters from the estate of serge 
lifar the russianborn choreographer whose lifelong dream was to 
return them to the writers home lifar died two years ago 
once owned by a member of the czars family grand duke mikhail 
they were acquired by sergei diaghilev the famous impresario who 
died in 1929 they eventually were obtained by lifar the executor 
of diaghilevs will 
the letters wrapped in plastic were handed over to a soviet 
delegation wednesday night in a brief ceremony organized by 
sothebys the auction house that negotiated the deal 
the price paid for the letters was not disclosed but reports 
indicated it was less than 1 million the money is to help fund a 
serge lifar prize awarded annually to promising young dancers 
added as a gift from countess lillan ahlefeldt lifars swedish 
companion during the last three decades of his life was a metal 
seal with the coat of arms of pushkin a scion of a noble russian 
family 
all but two of the letters were addressed to natalya goncharova 
whom pushkin married in 1831 after a turbulent courtship pushkin 
died six years later in a duel with his brotherinlaw who he felt 
had attacked natalyas honor 
one of the letters written in french and read aloud at the 
ceremony revealed pushkins feelings for natalya and his fear his 
mother would prevent their marriage 
maybe she is right and i am wrong in believing that happiness 
would be mine the poet wrote in his flowing handwriting while on 
a trip in the russian provinces but in any case you are 
absolutely free to decide as for myself i give you my word of 
honor that i will either belong to you or never marry 
the letters to natalya were written while she was separated from 
him because of a quarantine imposed on moscow residents during a 
cholera epidemic in 1830 many letters were pierced with a pin 
apparently in the naive belief this would kill cholera germs 
experts said 
the letters will be kept in the pushkin museum of leningrad 
formerly st petersburg where pushkin the author of boris 
godunov and eugen onegin settled after his wedding 
yuri m khilchevski the deputy soviet minister of culture said 
it was very touching the soviet union obtained the letters to 
miss goncharova 
he said people increasingly value the pure source of 
pushkins works and he likened their importance in russian 
literature to the geological foundations of the alps 
countess ahlefeldt told the associated press that soviet experts 
had paid lifar several visits since the early 1970s but never 
followed up with concrete offers for the letters 
throughout his life serge had hoped that the letters would 
return she said adding that despite great financial problems he 
refused tempting offers from other countries including the united 
states 
instead of selling the letters he would eat biscuits and take 
the metro she said but they the soviets left him waiting 
until his death 
she said that on the morning of his death lifar asked her to see 
if there was a letter from moscow there wasnt she said 
lifar revolutionized french ballet as a refugee from the soviet 
union in 1923 he died dec 15 1986 at the age of 81 in switzerland

finance ministers from japan west germany 
britain france italy and canada have been invited by the united 
states to meet feb 3 in washington to review the economic situation 
in the world a treasury department official said thursday 
third world debt has reached 13 trillion and presidentelect 
bush who takes office friday has said he wants to have a review of 
the problem 
the invitation for the meeting of the socalled group of seven 
or g7 was announced by a treasury official who spoke only on 
condition of anonymity the official said it also would be a chance 
for treasury secretary nicholas f brady and his counterparts to get 
acquainted with a new member 
japanese finance minister tatsuo murayama who took office dec 
27 is the new member since the group met in berlin last september 
third world countries have complained about having to pay tens of 
billions every year in principal and interest to wealthier 
countries money they would like to use for investments that would 
check the decline in their living standards 
on the same day as the washington meeting heads of the leading 
latin american debtor governments are to meet in caracas venezuela 
they owe more than 440 billion of the debt 
james a baker iii bushs nominee for secretary of state told 
the senate foreign relations committee on wednesday that a way must 
be found to get new capital to debtor countries at the same time 
he opposed shifting the burden of their old debts from private banks 
to taxpayers in the united states and other creditor countries 
he also asked for more transparency on new credits recently 
offered to the soviet union by banks in allied countries former 
defense secretary caspar weinberger has estimated those credits at 
7 billion the money could all be going to improve fertilizer 
production but the same chemicals could be used for warfare he 
added 
meanwhile outgoing commerce secretary c william verity on 
thursday called for an academic peace corps in lesserdeveloped 
countries to be financed by exchanging third world debt for the 
foreign education of american students 
verity said that while the program would have only a marginal 
impact on the huge amounts owed by debtor nations it could 
dramatically increase the slim numbers of americans studying in 
third world countries 
he said americas inadequate understanding of other cultures 
handicaps its dealings in international affairs and world trade 
less than 2500 americans received credit for study in latin 
american in 1986 verity said 
under veritys proposal loans that foreign countries have 
received from us banks would be given or sold at a discount to 
american universities which would exchange the debt for local 
currency in the foreign countries and use it to finance education 
programs there 
banks could benefit by clearing debt from their books debtor 
nations would have their dollar debt reduced and the universities 
would obtain foreign currency at favorable prices verity said 
he said several universities have expressed interest in using the 
debtforeducation program including texas aampm michigan state 
university and ohio state the commerce department will help promote 
the idea and keep banks and schools advised of swap opportunities 
he said

polish leader gen wojciech jaruzelski on 
thursday disclosed the government plan for legalizing solidarity 
saying conditions to reinstate the banned union can be negotiated if 
it agrees to respect the law 
the communist partys position paper on trade unions and 
political freedoms was a momentous event for poland jaruzelski 
said 
solidarity leader lech walesa reacted cautiously in his first 
comment on the offer but said his union was at a critical juncture 
in its quest for legalization 
if we blow it here other people will have to deal with the 
same problem again he said in gdansk i dont want my son and 
his generation to live through such things again where it 
accumlates rots and then explodes 
walesa said he would await a copy of the official text of the 
party document before making a more complete statement on the 
conditions for reinstating the soviet blocs first independent trade 
union 
our offer is honest and serious jaruzelski said at a rare 
news conference i count on the fact that taking it up 
constructively will allow a historical step in polands 
development that is what we all desire 
the offer marks a dramatic reversal in policy for jaruzelski and 
other party leaders whose decision to impose martial law on dec 13 
1981 crushed the union and reflects the failure of efforts to 
eradicate the opposition in the past seven years 
the party appears to be seeking a partnership with constructive 
elements of the opposition to battle rapidly rising inflation a 
multibilliondollar foreign debt and chronically illstocked stores 
the position paper released to the media thursday night and to be 
published in newspapers nationwide friday contains broadly written 
conditions for allowing more than one legal trade union 
jaruzelski said solidaritys willingness to respect polands 
constitution was the most important condition to legalize the union 
and that details could be worked out at governmentproposed 
discussions 
for me an obvious and unquestionable condition and this is a 
condition is whether solidarity agrees to accept and will respect 
the order of the socialist state legal and constitutional he 
said 
jaruzelski declined to say when the talks first proposed by the 
authorities in august during polands worst wave of labor unrest in 
seven years could begin 
other conditions outlined in the position paper say the new 
unions must be nonviolent must rely on lawful sources of funding 
an apparent reference to solidaritys financial support from the 
west and must contribute positively to economic development which 
appeared to be an effort to discourage strikes 
jaruzelski said that just as the party is not the same as it was 
in 1981 we expect that solidarity if it is created in its legal 
form will not be the same either 
the party leader defended the martial law decision saying i 
think without martial law there would have been no 
roundtable referring to the talks with the opposition 
the paper does not contain a timetable for legalization or call 
on the new unions to refrain from striking although party leaders 
have suggested a twoyear trial period with no strikes 
there is one direct reference to soldiarity saying it could be 
one of the new trade unions created it says the various unions at a 
work place should negotiate together 
jaruzelski said he was optimistic the government could reach 
agreement with the opposition and would not rule out a meeting with 
walesa saying politicians never say never 
i think you will share the view that it was a momentous event 
in the life of our party and at the same time it has a big chance to 
become a turning point in the life of our country jaruzelski said 
of th plenums decisions 
although the television evening news opened with the jaruzelski 
news conference a short fragment of walesas comments in gdansk was 
also shown on tv and the staterun news agency pap carried a summary 
of walesas remarks 
the solidarity leader sounded cautious but optimistic saying the 
decision at the party meeting showed the first signs of 
understanding on the part of the authorities 
at the news conference in the solidarity stronghold at st 
brygidas church in the port city of gdansk walesa said the party 
offier has some positive and negative elements to consider 
we cant destroy this possibility of true union freedom but 
at the same time we shouldnt struggle for some ambitious 
details he said 
it is a lot for this party but it is too little for social 
demands and expectations he said 
the party leadership approved the document on political and union 
freedom early wednesday after a twoday meeting jaruzelski offered 
to resign as party leader and head of state after encountering 
heated opposition to the plan but then received a vote of confidence 
from the 230member central committee 
walesa said he will address shipyard workers in gdansk on friday 
when workers will have been able to read the party position paper 
adam michnik a senior adviser to walesa called the plenum a 
step forward saying that for the first time they announced at a 
plenum that the legalization of solidarity can be the subject of 
talks 
walesa has said the authorities must agree to legalize solidarity 
in order for talks with the opposition to take place 
he said he saw invitations to speak at two legal rallies in 
warsaw next week as a sign of government good faith and said 
officials asked management at the lenin shipyard where he works as 
an electrician to excuse him for the events

the agriculture department on thursday proposed 
new rules that will give the agency a say in the leasing of national 
forest land to oil and gas developers 
f dale robertson chief of the departments forest service said 
oil and gas companies hold leases for 17 million acres of the 
agencys 191 million acres of national forest land 
in the past leasing authority was held exclusively by the 
interior departments bureau of land management but 
leasingrevision legislation in 1987 expanded the authority of the 
secretary of agriculture 
under the proposed rules leases for oil and gas on forest lands 
cannot be issued by blm without approval of the forest service 
robertson said 
final regulations will be issued after a 60day comment period 
and time for agency officials to study those comments he said 
written comments can be sent to f dale robertson chief forest 
service usda po box 96090 washington dc 200906090 
in a separate action the forest service said it has begun new 
streamlined procedures for handling public appeals of land and 
resource management decisions by agency officials 
the new rules separate procedures for appealing forest service 
decisions on use and occupancy permits for national forest land from 
procedures appealing decisions on land and resource managment plans 
using the two appeals channels will expedite the resolution of 
disagreements between citizens and decisionmakers without 
unnecessarily delaying national forest management robertson said

a task force representing both the housing 
industry and tenants recommended thursday that congress make 
permanent a tax credit to investors as an incentive for building 
lowincome rental housing 
the lowincome housing tax credit is the prime producer now of 
lowincome housing said elizabeth mitchell chairman of the group 
first and foremost we believe that it should be made 
permanent said ms mitchell who is executive director of the 
maine state housing authority it is vital to the successful means 
employed to solving the nations housing problems 
the panel also recommended that congress extend the duration of 
the lowincome use compliance period remove constraints to using 
other federal subsidies with the tax credit and expand the pool of 
investors who can use the credits and types of projects the credit 
covers 
the recommendations were delivered to senate majority leader 
george mitchell dmaine and sen john danforth rmo who formed 
the panel to study the tax credit last may 
mitchell and danforth members of the senate finance committee 
said they would use the panels report as a basis for proposed 
changes in the tax law to amend and extend the current credit 
in my view it would be unthinkable not to extend the only 
remaining incentive in the tax code for the health of lowincome 
housing said mitchell 
the lowincome tax credit was amended in 1986 to encourage 
developers to invest in building and rehabilitation of housing for 
low and moderateincome people after changes took away most of the 
deductions for passive losses and property depreciation 
to get the credit property owners must set aside either 20 
percent of the units in a property for families with incomes less 
than 50 percent of the median income in an area or 40 percent for 
families with incomes less than 60 percent of the area median 
if congress fails to act the tax credit will expire at the end of 
this year 
the panels recommendations came on the same day the government 
reported thursday that housing construction fell to its lowest level 
in six years in 1988 earlier in the week jack kemp 
presidentelect bushs choice as secretary of the department of 
housing and urban development told city officials the tax revision 
may have gone too far and stunted low and moderateincome 
housing construction

quickly dispersed by authorities thursday without violence police 
said 
rafael guerrero governor of surrounding guayas province said 
members of the marxist democratic popular movement and of the 
populist roldosista party were instigating the protests to 
destabilize the nations new centerleft government 
roldosista chief abdula bucaram a fiery and outspoken populist 
lost to leftleaning rodrigo borja in last years presidential 
elections which frequently erupted in personal criticism and name 
calling 
borja head of the democratic left party imposed unpopular 
austerity measures shortly after taking office in august to combat

virginia military institute where 
grayuniformed cadets live by an honor code so strict they are 
thrown out for lying was in shock thursday over two cadets role in 
a 45 million armored car heist 
most people are in disbelief said senior greg skinner of new 
york city they cant believe it happened it shouldnt have 
happened 
william t jasinski 22 of boonton nj and bryan smals 21 
of columbus ohio were in custody awaiting a hearing friday in 
federal court in roanoke 
they are accused along with jasinskis father robert t 
jasinski 51 also of boonton in a dec 22 robbery 
the cadets told a us magistrate wednesday they put on rented 
police uniforms and carried out the robbery that acknowledgement 
ensures they will be drummed out of vmi if they try to return a 
spokesman and a number of cadets said 
theyre dead ducks vmi spokesman tom joynes said in an 
interview we hope these kids will have sense enough to resign 
if they come back theyll be dismissed by the honor court 
because they admitted stealing the honor code prohibits lying 
cheating or stealing or tolerating those who do 
cadets interviewed thursday outside the schools stonewall 
jackson barracks said the incident will harm vmis reputation 
vmi cadets are supposed to uphold the image of an honorable 
person but one bad person can give vmi a bad image said robin 
pitaniello a junior from lynchburg 
but he said he was not calling the two cadets bad because he 
did not know if they were guilty 
publicity of the heist could not have come at a worse time with 
some 400 cadets ready to march in washington at george bushs 
inauguration friday joynes noted but he doubted the arrests would 
tarnish vmis image for long 
this is the only scandal weve had in anybodys memory 
joynes said other schools go through this sort of thing all the 
time 
about four or five cadets are expelled by the honor court each 
year generally because of lying he said 
stealing is rare joynes said i doubt weve had one of 
those in 10 years 
respect for the honor code is obvious to visitors of the 
150yearold vmi which has some 1300 cadets all of them male 
a reporter who stopped at a snack bar on campus noticed a dollar 
bill tacked to a bulletin board snack bar workers said that when a 
cadet finds money in the dining area he tacks it on the board for 
the person who lost it 
but joynes said the cadets respect for authority may have been 
what led jasinski into going along with his fathers alleged plot to 
rob the armored car of coin depot armored car co where the elder 
jasinski worked as a parttime driver 
im sure his father could have influenced him but how did he 
influence the other kid joynes said 
the elder jasinski was released thursday on 400000 bail backed 
by the deed to his house which assistant us attorney john lacey 
said was valued at about 900000 but he was represented by a 
federal public defender for which he was ruled eligible for 
financial reasons by us magistrate ronald hedges in newark nj 
joynes described smals a sophomore as an extremely bright 
english major on a navy scholarship while jasinski was a cstudent 
and a fifthyear senior studying mechanical engineering 
cadets who knew the pair said they were quiet but friendly young 
men who worked out a lot with weights and did not get involved in 
extracurricular activities

the nations mayors declaring their readiness 
to cooperate with the bush administration urged the incoming 
president thursday to add 107 billion to president reagans budget 
for urban aid 
the last reagan budget recommended additional cuts in urban 
programs which over the past 10 years have shouldered an 
overwhelming burden in the battle to reduce the deficit the 
mayors said in a statement issued at the close of their annual 
winter meeting 
the mayors said that during reagans eight years in office the 
cumulative budget for key urban programs was cut by nearly 82 
percent 
mayor arthur j holland of trenton nj president of the us 
conference of mayors said a delegation of mayors met with bush a 
few weeks ago and left with the impression that the 
presidentelect was sensitive to our needs and would do eveything he 
could to help meet those needs 
holland and a bipartisan group of mayors who participated in a 
news conference closing the winter meeting had high praise for jack 
kemp bushs choice as secretary of the department of housing and 
urban development 
kemp met with the mayors wednesday telling them 
im going to be an activist im going to be an advocate the 
door is open my mind is open 
holland said that he didnt know of any secretary whos 
approached his responsibilities with more enthusiasm than jack 
kemp 
the mayors said the budget reagan sent to congress last week cut 
27 billion over current appropriations for urban programs such as 
mass transit clean water construction grants and urban development 
action grants the mayors called for freezing those programs at 
current levels 
the mayors also called for 2 billion in additional money for 
assistance to children through such programs as head start job 
corps medicaid and compensatory education 
finally said the mayor the federal government should invest an 
additional 3 billion in housing 2 billion in child care and 1 
billion in trageted fiscal assistance to help cities facing 
financial crises 
when holland was asked if he had any hope that the new 
administration would respond favorably to the request from the 
mayors he replied to be a mayor is to live in hope

on the eve of taking office as president 
george bush said he is not inclined to meet with soviet leader 
mikhail s gorbachev for the mere purpose of keeping highlevel 
ussoviet contacts going 
in a wideranging interview in his vice presidential office 
across from the white house bush refused to predict whether he and 
gorbachev would even see each other during the first year of a bush 
presidency he parted company with president reagan on one issue 
the panama canal treaty and offered veiled criticism of 
palestinian leader yasser arafat 
bush seemed upbeat and at ease during the interview with news 
service reporters when someone suggested he might be too excited to 
rest on the night before becoming president bush said he would be 
able to sleep i dont feel the tension that i thought he said 
bush spent most of the day out of the public eye he did venture 
out for a meeting with top high school youths from around the 
country and pledged there to do all in my power to help you help 
yourselves prepare for a brighter future 
bush offered some of his characteristic optimism a quality 
shared with ronald reagan to the students i really feel this 
he told them our best days are yet to come 
the vice president rehearsed the inaugural address that he will 
deliver at noon friday when reagan relinquishes office and bush 
assumes it in a ceremony outside the capitol 
in his interview bush said a puported taperecorded threat by 
palestine liberation organization chief arafat against moderate 
arabs was a setback to peace rather than an enhancement of 
peace he said the threat does not facilitate improved relations 
with arafat who won american support after he made a public 
commitment to renounce terrorism 
on another subject bush seemed to differ with reagans statement 
wednesday that the united states should reconsider the treaties to 
turn over the operation of the panama canal to panama if strongman 
manuel antonio noriega remains in power 
the treaty has certain obligations that ought to be met bush 
said im a great believer that once a treaty is entered into and 
ratified it ought to be kept but id have to look at the treaty 
before i have any comment on that 
previewing his inaugural address bush said it will be just a 
broad appeal to the american people to pitch in and help itll be 
an expression of satisfaction about how far weve come as a nation 
and a recognition that weve got a long way to go 
it will be a reemphasis of my conviction that many of these 
problems that remain unsolved can best be solved by engagement of 
the thousand points of light concept of people helping people 
on other points bush said 
he plans a meeting tuesday with the democratic and republican 
leaders of congress 
the idea of a dramatic 100day beginning of his administration 
is a concept that doesnt really apply in his case because hes 
taking over from a president with whom hes served 
he would like to be further along in picking candidates for 
highlevel positions below the rank of cabinet secretary but added 
were doing all right on it 
reducing the budget deficit is his top priority this is the 
no 1 domestic economic problem facing the country he said the 
administration will negotiate with congress on the problem adding 
im not quite naive enough to believe theyll accept absolutely 
everything i propose 
he wants early action on tightening ethics laws moreover he 
said id like to see some action on not only formulating the 
policy but taking certain steps towards more accomplishment and 
understanding in the environmental field he said antidrug 
efforts would gear up 
money will not be available to do all the things i want to do 
and that i feel are priority in the field of education some 
of what i want to do obviously is going to have to wait on the 
solution to the budget question 
he will not follow reagans practice of making a weekly saturday 
address on the radio 
bush said one of his first acts as president would be to order a 
major review of us relations with the soviets a step that will 
delay any chance of quick movement in strategic arms reduction talks 
set to resume feb 15 
i dont think we risk losing momentum that president reagan 
achieved because i think the soviets understand that my intention is 
not to drag my feet but to simply do a prudent reassessment bush 
said 
bush said he did not know how long the review would take even to 
the point of whether it would take up to six months or a year he 
said the united states also will have to review its posture 
regarding conventional arms talks involving nato and warsaw pact 
nations 
asked to rate the odds of a summit with gorbachev this year bush 
said i dont think we can make the odds and more important than 
that is that we have good sound positions that we will be 
advocating and whether that results in a summit or not i think is 
less important than the fact that the process will go forward 
asked if he shared reagans view that there was some value in a 
summit just to meet and talk bush said not necessarily but i 
wont say that that would never happen 
what i dont want to do though and wont do is schedule a 
meeting just to have it said that were having a meeting because i 
dont think that does anything but needlessly raise expectations 
with little chance of fulfillment of some objective 
saying he did not want to be hemmed in by life at the white 
house bush promised to change the pattern set by reagan of sticking 
to a carefully orchestrated schedule never leaving the white house 
without advance warning to the press 
i cant pledge to be anchored down bush said you just 
dont want to get totally isolated

britain issued an advisory thursday 
urging its nationals and citizens of six other countries for whom it 
has diplomatic responsibility to leave afghanistan immediately 
officials at the us embassy said they probably would give the 
same advice to the dozen or so american missionaries still in the 
country western embassies also confer regularly about whether to 
close 
britains warning coincided with reports that all soviet troops 
in kabul would withdraw by early february along the salang highway 
the main route north to the soviet border to guard the final 
departure from afghanistan by a feb 15 deadline 
when soviet forces are gone after more than nine years the 
afghan civil war will be back in the hands of the governments 
poorly trained conscript army and moslem guerrillas who began 
fighting after a communist coup in april 1978 
as the soviet soldiers have withdrawn under a unmediated 
agreement guerrillas have increased attacks on the salang highway 
to stop supply convoys from reaching kabul the result has been 
acute food and fuel shortages that are growing worse 
the insurgents predict a quick victory over the forces of 
president najib and some western diplomats agree one said najibs 
regime should fall fairly fast after the soviet withdrawal is 
complete 
clovis meath baker the british charge daffaires summoned the 
few british journalists in the capital and delivered what he called 
a final warning to leave while normal flights are still 
available 
in a letter to the 71 britons australians canadians new 
zealanders irish danes and finns still in the country meath baker 
said there is no question of any subsequent evacuation being 
arranged by the british government 
at the foreign office in london a spokesman said in announcing 
the warning the situation in kabul is deteriorating there are 
food shortages fuel shortages and the probability is that these 
will get worse nearer to the russian withdrawal 
near the time of the withdrawal you cant guarantee commercial 
flights will come in and out 
an informed soviet source said privately all red army troops were 
expected to be out of kabul early in february along with the soviet 
high command 
soviet military forces entered afghanistan in december 1979 and 
an estimated 115000 were in the country when the withdrawal began 
may 15 under an agreement signed in geneva a month earlier half 
were gone by aug 15 and the remainder are to be out by feb 15 
the guerrillas most of whom are based in border camps and cities 
just inside pakistan were not parties to the geneva agreement and 
have rejected offers of a coalition government from najib 
kabul radio said thursday that government troops shot down two 
pakistani helicopters ferrying foreign advisers and guerrilla 
leaders to the eastern nangarhar province it said everyone aboard 
was killed but did not give casualty figures pakistan routinely 
denies such reports by official afghan media 
another radio report said a rocket attack wounded five people at 
a 315bed hospital in kandahar afghanistans secondlargest city 
it blamed the insurgents who are supported by the united states and 
pakistan 
most of the britons and others warned by the embassy are with 
un agencies or the international committee of the red cross which 
has a hospital for war wounded in kabul 
also among the britons are 19 resident missionaries with their 
families who work for the charitable international aid mission 
families of most foreigners left last summer after the first half of 
the soviet withdrawal was complete

a new rule allowing the separation or 
uncoupling of beef quality and beef yield grades has been approved 
and will take effect april 9 the agriculture department said 
thursday 
j patrick boyle head of the departments agricultural marketing 
service said the change was in response to a petition filed in june 
1987 by the american meat institute and the national cattlemens 
association 
the rule allows the beef industry to determine whether to have 
carcasses graded by usda for quality or for yield or both boyle 
said previously a carcass had to be grade both for quality and 
yield or not graded at all 
meat grading is a voluntary program offered by the agency and is 
paid for by user fees 
boyle said the trade associations asked for the rule changes in 
order to utilize new more efficient technologies now available for 
preparing beef carcasses one of which is hotfat trimming just 
after slaughter instead of trimming after the carcasses are 
chilled as is the current practice 
the new rule should benefit producers packers and consumers 
alike it allows packers the option to use new technologies and 
also may allow cattle producers to be compensated for the lean meat 
yield of their animals he said 
manly molpus president of the american meat association said he 
was extremely pleased by the usda action and that it will give 
the industry the flexibility it has long needed now he added 
the marketplace rather than the government can better determine 
how beef is marketed

george bush saying he doesnt want to be 
anchored down indicated thursday he will keep on making 
spurofthemoment jaunts around town as president with or without 
reporters in tow 
bush voiced clear skepticism over the practice in which a small 
protective pool of reporters follows a president whenever he 
leaves the white house whether on official business or personal 
business 
whats being protected bush asked in an inaugurationeve 
interview with a group of news service reporters 
you mean if something happened like i fell over and choked at 
a restaurant what if i fall over and choke in the white house 
youre not there 
i cant pledge to be anchored down id like to work out some 
understanding that the world is not going to come to a screeching 
halt if you dont know that im eating peking duck over in 
virginia bush said 
you may not agree with that he said but i think its 
silly to have to feel that when the president goes out of that 
thing the white house that serious journalists or their editors 
feel the nations business will come to a halt if that is not 
reported 
bush as vice president has been known for venturing into public 
places frequently often going to restaurants with family and 
friends dropping in a neighborhood delicatessen shopping in super 
markets and visiting hardware stores 
this style contrasts sharply with that of president reagan who 
seldom left the white house except with advance notice or without a 
travel pool of reporters in his motorcade 
im not going to give up my ability to make a decision in a 
hurry bush said 
he suggested that for one thing going around town with a large 
entourage that includes reporters can make it harder to find a 
parking place in front of a restaurant 
bush said if he decides at the last minute to have dinner with 
friends at joes bar or joes restaurant weve got to be able to 
be flexible 
and you shouldnt have to be rudely treated by standing out in 
the cold wondering what the hell ive ordered in a chinese 
restaurant bush said 
im not going to shake you bush added but im not going 
to feel obligated to say we cant do this for an hour because weve 
got to notify the news media

that has become her trademark was cheered by thousands of 
supporters thursday as she poked fun at her appearance joked about 
her husbands fishing and bragged about her family 
mrs bush a 63yearold grandmother with snow white hair and an 
imposing figure appeared at the salute to the first lady an 
event that more than 6000 people paid 50 a ticket to attend 
the gathering held at the john f kennedy center for the 
performing arts drew so many people that mrs bush and marilyn 
quayle the wife of vice presidentelect dan quayle appeared before 
audiences in the concert hall the opera hall and the theater

said mrs bush who often indulges in selfdeprecating remarks 
as the crowd roared mrs bush stood on the stage and pointed to 
herself please notice the hair the makeup designer clothes 
i want you to watch me all week and remember you may never see it 
again 
mrs bush wearing a blue suit her favorite color with a 
large patterned bow at her neck called the tribute unbelievable 
and undeserved 
the bluntspoken mrs bush known for her candor and lack of 
pretense also poked fun at her husbands complaints this week that 
packing for the move to the white house was a laborious and tedious 
process 
noting that bush spent last weekend fishing in florida his wife 
of 43 years said so much to the packing story 
mrs bush who is fiercely loyal to her husband and five children 
and their families later said she considered herself the worlds 
luckiest woman because she had married a man i love more than 
life 
actors bruce boxleitner and charlton heston and actress cheryl 
ladd read virtually identical scripts as they introduced mrs bush 
to successive audiences they described her as kind generous 
warm and dedicated with values that are similar to those held by

difficult time controlling her emotions im going to get weepy 
because barbara is so special said the wife of the vice 
presidentelect a lawyer with three children

spirit that she will take to the white house mrs quayle said 
shes the one who is going to cry in the family mrs bush 
joked

from the national symphony orchestra to the preservation hall jazz

a japanese company said thursday it has developed a 
test that can seek out even the tiniest traces of the explosive tnt 
matsushita electric industrial co has not decided whether it 
will apply the technology to make bomb detection devices but could 
do so in two or three years said matsushita official jun asai said 
asai said matsushitas biosensing technology can detect 
onebillionth of a gram per cubic centimeter of tnt existing in the 
atmosphere as vapor or microscopic particles 
if terrorists carried any substances containing tnt he said tnt 
particles would leak into the nearby atmosphere where the new 
technology could detect them 
he said matsushitas central research laboratory first developed 
a protein called an antibody with a high affinity for tnt testers 
can collect atmospheric components from any substances that they 
believe contain tnt and make a water solution with the antibody 
when tnt binds to the antibody fluorescent light from the antibody 
will decrease asai added 
he said matsushita discovered the technology while studying the 
possibility of developing antibodies that can detect odors beyond 
the sensitivity limits of animals and detect diseases such as 
tumors high blood pressure and cerebral thrombosis

the message was written in block leters on the side 
of a boardedup market 
it read help 
in miamis impoverished and predominantly black overtown 
district the plea could easily symbolize the areas turbulent 
present and uncertain future 
the graffiticovered building stands two blocks from where a 
hispanic police officer fatally shot a 23yearold black 
motorcyclist monday night triggering violence fueled by frustration 
over unemployment and an influx of central american refugees 
many of the 10000 overtown residents look beyond the arson 
gunfire and looting toward the specter of downtown development that 
threatens to wipe out the oncevibrant neighborhood 
we may be seeing the beginning of the end of overtown said 
rev richard barry of st agnes episcopal church in the heart of 
the neighborhood you see them building expensive condos over by 
miami arena the city fathers want to change downtown that means 
getting rid of overtown 
among all the burnedout buildings and neglect theres hardly 
anyone who remembers that overtown has a rich history 
the first residents of the area were black workers extending the 
florida east coast railroad south from west palm beach in the 1890s 
they built the area into a flourishing business and residential 
community by the 1950s 
but highway construction for the growing miami metropolis in the 
1960s forced many black middleclass residents and business owners 
out of what was then known as the central negro district 
the name overtown derives from the conversations of people 
planning to visit the neighborhood 
theyd say im going overtown said leome culmer chairman 
of the speakers bureau of the black archives of miami it was 
quite a place back then 
but the legacy of overtowns heyday has long since disappeared 
whats left was lowincome blacks in a congested area and without 
jobs said barry 
since the riots of 1980 claimed 18 lives and dozens of businesses 
citywide the decline of overtown has been steady residents say 
city officials overtown residents claim have focused on the 
surge of cuban and central american refugees at the expense of job 
and housing programs in black neighborhoods including overtown and 
liberty city which is about 30 blocks to the north 
liberty city was started as a residential development for blacks 
in the 1920s to relieve overcrowding in overtown 
overtown now is a collection of struggling stores and 
deteriorating twostory apartment buildings palm trees are 
surrounded by junk and litter in vacant lots a 1983 city study 
placed the unemployment rate at more than 36 percent 
theres probably crack on every corner said police spokesman

the 50000 soviet troops being pulled out 
of eastern europe will take the nuclear missiles and other arms 
under their control with them the soviet foreign minister said 
thursday 
a nato spokesman welcomed the announcement by foreign minister 
eduard shevardnadze as encouraging us arms negotiator stephen 
ledogar said the speech was very upbeat very positive but 
warned against reading more into the statement than the kremlin 
intended 
shevardnadzes speech came on the final day of a gathering that 
produced a 35nation human rights accord shevardnadze said the 
agreement was the product of a changing relationship between east 
and west 
the vienna meeting has shaken up the iron curtain weakened its 
rusty supports made new breaches in it and hastened its 
corrosion he said referring to the eastwest division as winston 
churchill described it 40 years ago 
truth must be visible shevardnadze said in promising that 
the kremlin would publish before the end of the month a timetable 
for troop removal 
soviet president mikhail s gorbachev in a unilateral move 
announced in december that soviet forces would be cut by 500000 
soldiers including 50000 stationed in eastern europe 
shevardnadze said the troops departing eastern europe will take 
with them all their organic armaments including tactical nuclear 
systems 
he also said the soviet union has stopped modernizing its 
shortrange nuclear weapons and called on the united states to 
follow suit 
those arms are tactical missiles with a range of less than 312 
miles the soviet union and the united states signed an accord more 
than a year ago to eliminate all intermediaterange nuclear forces 
and are negotiating deep cuts in strategic arms 
us secretary of state george p shultz said last month the 
soviet troop withdrawal would reduce the warsaw pacts edge in 
divisions in europe only to 291to1 from 299 nato estimates 
soviet forces in europe at 22 million 
the center for defense information a private research group 
estimated the soviets have 1400 landbased shortrange nuclear 
mssiles in europe it said the missiles all mobile are 600 scuds 
660 ss21s and 140 frogs 
ledogar the us ambassador to arms talks that are to start in 
march said modernization is an option the united states would like 
to keep until nato and the sovietled warsaw pact have an equal 
number of troops tanks and other nonnuclear forces 
we dont want to abandon the nuclear leg of the deterrent until 
we have a much better situation on conventional forces he told 
the associated press 
during a brief exchange with reporters after his speech 
shevardnadze made it clear that only shortrange weapons that are 
part of the military units to be withdrawn will be dismantled 
without conditions 
he said he could not say what percentage of the kremlins 
shortrange stockpile would remain deployed but that these figures 
and others will be released in detail before the march 9 start of 
the conventional armed forces in europe negotiations 
those talks are mandated in the human rights accord approved 
sunday by the united states soviet union canada and 32 european 
nations the agreement also calls for freer travel emigration 
speech and religious practices 
shevardnadze held a brief impromptu news conference later in the 
day and was asked to describe the difference between the berlin 
wall and the iron curtain he disparaged in his speech 
he said the wall which has divided berlin since it was erected 
27 years ago is a matter for east germany 
we have no intention of interfering in the sovereign affairs of 
this country and advise others to do likewise he said 
east german foreign minister oskar fischer alluded to the wall in 
a speech thursday and suggested that calls for it to be torn down 
infringe on his nations sovereign rights 
in his speech shevardnadze praised his us counterpart 
secretary of state george shultz who steps down friday with the end 
of the reagan era 
i shall permit myself to pay tribute to him for everything that 
he endeavored managed to do and achieved in our common efforts 
shevardnadze said 
after a meeting with shevardnadze italian foreign minister 
giulio andreotti announced that soviet president mikhail s 
gorbachev will visit italy in november 
no soviet communist party chief has visited italy and analysts 
said the trip could set the stage for an historic meeting with pope 
john paul ii the vatican always has said the pope would be open to 
such a meeting

the government has ordered an 
antiapartheid activist to explain why he should not have his 
political activities restricted even though he died last year his 
father said thursday 
black student leader caiphus nyoka was shot 12 times when police 
raided his house on aug 24 1987 in daveyton a township near 
johannesburg police said they shot nyoka 23 when he attempted to 
reach for an object under his bed 
more than 1000 people attended his funeral which was monitored 
by scores of police 
the government sent a letter dated jan 10 to nyokas house 
stating that the activist was to be placed on a list of restricted 
activists said his father abednego nyoka 
its such an insult said the elder nyoka i have a death 
certificate from the government why are they doing this they are 
making a mockery of his death 
the letter said nyoka had 30 days to show why your name ought 
not to be entered in the consolidated list 
the letter added that if nyoka wanted to stay off the list he 
would have to prove he did not know that his organization was 
involved in activities that might render it to be declared 
unlawful 
nyoka was active in the congress of south african students one 
of dozens of banned organizations fighting south africas system of 
racial segregation 
the new nation a weekly aimed at black readers reported 
thursday that hundreds of activists recently received letters 
similar to the one sent to nyoka 
the restrictions vary but they often bar activists from 
participating in politics speaking to journalists or traveling 
from their hometown 
a spokesman for the justice ministry dirk de villiers declined 
comment on the matter

president reagan made the final public speech 
of his presidency a fittingly patriotic one thursday as he presented 
the medal of freedom to secretary of state george p shultz and 
ambassador mike mansfield and saluted them as two remarkable 
americans 
since this is the last speech that i will give as president i 
think it is fitting to give one final thought an observation about 
a country that i love reagan said 
there is nothing so precious and irreplaceable as americas 
freedom added reagan in the patriotic manner that has marked his 
speeches for decades 
americas freedom does not belong to just one nation he 
said we are custodians of freedom for the world 
we lead the world because unique among nations we draw our 
people and our strength from every country and every corner of the 
world 
the president described the united states as always on the 
cutting edge always leading the world to the next frontier 
reagan said the medal of freedom awarded for contributions to 
the national interest world peace and cultural achievement among 
other endeavors represents the reverence americans have for 
liberty 
he said mansfield former senate majority leader who recently 
resigned after more than a decade as ambassador to japan had 
distinguished himself as a dedicated public servant 
mansfield accepting the medal said reagan had laid out a 
sound policy for our future in the pacific and east asia and for 
the first time in memory we have both a president of the united 
states and a secretary of state who are actively interested in the 
pacific in japan and in east asia 
i anticipate that the policy these men have laid down will be 
continued he added 
reagan said shultz had inaugurated a new era of hope in foreign 
policy and presided over the state department during one of the 
most critical periods in the history of this nations foreign 
policy 
shultz in his response said there is a phrase thats 
catching on the reagan years and mr president it has a ring 
to it its the ring of freedom you have adocated it fought for 
it 
you have known that the price of freedom is enternal vigilance 
that there are times when it requires action sometimes at least 
at first not necessarily popular action but you have to do it he 
said 
mansfield paid tribute to his wife maureen in his remarks and 
shultz walked over to his wifes table gave her a kiss and handed 
the medal to her after receiving it at the ceremony in the east room 
among those in the audience was vernon walter us ambassador to 
the united nations who earlier in the day received the citizens 
medal from reagan the citizens medal is given to ctizens who have 
performed deeds of service to their country or their fellow citizens

turkey output is not expanding as rapidly this 
year and consumers can expect higher prices farther down the line 
the agriculture department said thursday 
production is expected to increase about 3 percent to an 
estimated 405 billion pounds from about 3033 billion pounds in 
1988 that would be only half the 6 percent increase in turkey meat 
output from 1987 to 1988 the departments economic research service 
said 
turkey producers are slowing their rate of increase after two 
years of lackluster returns the agency said wholesale hen 
turkey prices in the eastern region averaged 61 cents per pound in 
1988 and are expected to average 63 to 69 cents in 1989 
another report which was issued by the departments agricultural 
statistics board said that surveys of turkey growers surveyed in 20 
major producing states intend to boost the number of birds not in 
pounds by 7 percent from last year 
however the report acknowledged the number of turkeys actually 
raised in 1989 may vary from growers intentions depending on 
feed costs the supply of hatching eggs and various other factors 
the report said us turkey production in 1988 totaled more than 
242 million birds up 1 percent from about 2404 million in 1987 
north carolina was first last year with 479 million turkeys 
followed by minnesota 385 million california 265 million 
arkansas 18 million missouri 165 million and virginia 163 
million

when congress passed a bill designating 
national asparagus month during a crush of important legislation 
last year for rep dave mccurdy it was the last stalk 
the oklahoma democrat on thursday introduced legislation to ban 
congress growing practice of passing commemmorative bills and 
instead create an 11member advisory panel to judge the merits of 
various requests for commemorative days weeks months and years 
mccurdy pointed out in a statement that more than onethird of 
the laws passed in the last congress were in the commemorative 
category among bills introduced were snow white week national 
dairy goat awareness week and national elvis presley day in all 
646 such bills were introduced in the 100th congress 
the annual costs of commemorative legislation cannot be 
precisely determined but we know from examining the process that 
they are enormous mccurdy said the annual printing costs of 
the resolutions alone run into the hundreds of thousands of 
dollars 
mccurdy said most of the commemmorative bills are worthy but his 
bill was a more commonsense approach to deciding which to 
recognize than spending time on the floor of a billiondollar 
congress

mayor marion barry jr appeared under subpoena 
thursday before a federal grand jury investigating his ties to a 
suspected drug dealer barry told reporters he had done nothing 
wrong and was not the target of the probe 
im not in trouble barry said at an impromptu news 
conference as he headed into the grand jurys meeting room in the 
federal courthouse the public sometimes has the impression that 
going before a grand jury means that someone is guilty but it 
only means they are investigating thats the american way 
barry met with the grand jury for about three hours he said 
little to reporters afterward 
kenneth mundy barrys attorney said he has received assurances 
that barry is not a target of the probe federal officials were not 
available to comment on mundys comment 
officials also refused to comment on barrys appearance before 
the grand jury but had earlier said that investigators are 
gathering information on whether barry thwarted a police drug probe 
and are also looking into the possible misuse of government funds 
the mayor was subpoenaed after failing to answer an informal 
request that he appear barry is expected to testify before the 
grand jury again next week mundy said 
on dec 22 police were inexplicably called off an attempt to 
make an undercover drug purchase from a former city employee 
charles lewis after barry showed up at his hotel room barry has 
also acknowledged contacting police officials looking into the 
affair but said he was only trying to speed up the probe 
district of columbia police chief maurice turner has denied that 
police were tipped off that barry was in lewis room but did say 
that detectives were called off their attempted drug purchase by the 
hotels manager 
the grand jury is also hearing testimony on a joint personnel 
project involving the district and the us virgin islands 
government lewis a former city employee spearheaded that project 
for the virgin islands he was fired last april after virgin islands 
officials expressed concern about cost overruns on the project 
barry and other top city officials ran up hotel and restaurant bills 
of more than 37000 in connection with the project 
so far lewis city personnel director theodore e thornton and a 
personal bodyguard who accompanied barry to lewis hotel room have 
testified at least once before the panel 
barrys telephone records police phone logs and thousands of 
documents connected with the virgin islands personnel project have 
also been subpoenaed those include contracts officials have said 
were prepared and backdated well after the project began 
because of his connections with lewis barry 52 is mired in his 
worst political crisis in the decade he has served as mayor of the 
nations capital 
barrys latest troubles have revived persistant rumors that he 
uses drugs and associates with drug users while he and his 
associates have also come under fire for the citys involvement in 
the virgin islands project 
the interior department which oversees affairs of the virgin 
islands government has not been able to find a written contract for 
the 260000 project and virgin islands gov alexander farrelly has 
said that the spending overruns means the district may not be paid 
the 80000 in costs it has claimed 
barry attempted to quell questions about his alleged drug use by 
taking a drug test tuesday 
dr vincent j roux the mayors personal physician pronounced 
barry drugfree after testing his urine for up to 10 illegal drugs 
including marijuana cocaine and barbituates 
however john white the mayors press secretary said he did not 
know whether the mayors blood was tested for drugs medical experts 
have said that blood testing is more exhaustive and can show traces 
of drugs that a urine test wont turn up

entertainer wayne newton on thursday accepted 
a 6 million libel award that had been collecting interest while he 
pursued his lawsuit against nbc saying he is satisfied his 
reputation has been restored 
this was not a matter of money this was a matter of 
vindication of my name the singer said after filing papers in 
federal court to collect the award over a 1980 nbc broadcast linking 
him to an organized crime figure 
a federal jury in las vegas awarded a record 223 to newton in 
1986 but a judge reduced it to 53 million and last month ordered 
him to accept the lower sum or face proving his case again in a new 
trial this time in los angeles 
newtons lawyer morton galane said that with interest the 53 
million award now equals 6 million such an amount would be 
higher than any libel award ever affirmed by an appellate court in 
the history of this nation he said 
galane said a survey conducted for newton satisfied him that his 
image had been restored and that the public understood that he had 
won his case 
nbc said thursday it would appeal the network said in a 
statement that a trial in los angeles would be less likely to 
produce the results seen in las vegas 
mr newtons refusal to put his case before a los angeles jury 
speaks for itself on all the issues including whether nbc libeled 
mr newton said thomas b ross nbc senior vice president of news 
the jury had ruled that the singer was defamed in a series of 
broadcasts nbc correspondent brian ross had reported that newton 
went to a reputed mob figure for help after his 3yearold 
daughters life was threatened 
newton argued the report left the impression that his 1980 
purchase of the aladdin hotel was linked to organized crime

prosecutor sait erem said thursday he was 
investigating allegations that four turks illegally sold their 
kidneys for transplants at a london hospital 
erem told the associated press that turkish law allows human 
organs to be donated for humanitarian reasons but forbids their 
sale those involved in a sale could receive prison terms of two to 
four years if convicted he said 
he said he started investigating after a turkish peasant claimed 
in a letter to his office jan 10 that one of his kidneys was 
removed at the private wellington humana hospital in london without 
his knowledge or consent 
the peasant alleged that three other turks donated kidneys at the 
hospital through a middleman tunc ay kunter of turkey and received 
as much as 5600 each erem reported the donors underwent the 
operations because of financial difficulties erem quoted the letter 
as saying 
erem identified the peasant as ahmet koc a 33yearold man from 
gulluce village in eastern turkey 
he said koc claimed in his petition that kunter approached him 
while koc was jobhunting in istanbul 
i was offered work in britain by kunter and underwent medical 
checkups at clinics in istanbul and later in london under his 
guidance as part of the immigration procedure i also signed 
documents in english which i did not understand then i was taken to 
a hotel which in fact was a hospital erem quoted koc as saying 
only later i found out that one of my kidneys had been removed 
and transplanted to a libyan doctor 
the prosecutor quoted koc as saying he was paid 4600 in 
september and then returned to turkey 
kunter a 55yearold retired military officer said during 
questioning tuesday that he acted as a middleman in the four kidney 
donations but that he made the arrangements for humanitarian 
reasons not profit according to erem 
the prosecutor also said kunter showed him an advertisement in 
the daily newspaper hurriyet in which koc offered to sell his 
kidney kunter said he contacted the other donors after seeing 
similar ads placed by them erem said 
kunter told authorities koc lodged his complaint after his 
demands for more money were refused erem said 
erem said he was investigating to find out if kunter and his 
londonbased brother received money from kidney recipients 
the prosecutor said dr raymond crockett allegedly performed the 
kidney removal operations 
the london daily independent reported wednesday that crockett and 
an unidentified hospital official said all the donors consented to 
the operations 
it also quoted the british health department as saying trade in 
kidneys for transplants is discouraged but not illegal in britain

rep mary rose oakar dohio said thursday 
that syrian president hafez assad has made a firm commitment to her 
to work for the release of the nine american hostages held in 
lebanon 
oakar who met with assad for more than four hours in damascus 
syria on jan 9 said in an interview that assad was very 
positive in saying that he would help in the hostage situation 
oakars comments came as president reagan told reporters a day 
before leaving office that he was frustrated by his inability to 
free the americans in wartorn lebanon 
we dont know where they are reagan said adding officials 
are working quietly and privately to win freedom for the 
hostages 
oakar said she raised the case of terry anderson a hostage since 
march 1985 anderson an associated press correspondent in lebanon 
when he was kidnapped and the longestheld hostage is a native of 
lorain ohio which is near oakars cleveland district 
during a trip to the middle east oakar arranged the wideranging 
session with assad also attending the meeting were sen arlen 
specter rpa and edward djerejian the us ambassador to syria 
specters office said he was attending inaugural events and could 
not be reached for comment immediately 
but oakar who has an arabamerican heritage said she was 
pleased with the reaction from assad when the discussion turned to 
the plight of anderson 
i felt that he was extremely firm in his commitment to help 
terry she said reading from her notes on the meeting oakar 
quoted assad as saying i want to say to the family that i will 
help 
the hostages are thought to be held by proiranian militants in 
the southern suburbs of beirut syria considers itself the main 
power broker in lebanon though fighting between rival militias has 
put pressure on syrias ability to influence events over the last 
few months 
the prospect of a syriansponsored settlement in lebanon a 
country where moslems and christians have fought for 13 years is 
not considered bright in the near future 
oakar said assad did not provide any details about how he might 
work for the hostages freedom however he said he viewed the 
hostages as a humanitarian issue rather than a political issue 
the syrian leader said the whole hostage question is a human 
question oakar said 
but assad is obviously a player in the region oakar said he 
could use his influence he obviously has occasions for 
dialogue she said 
she said assad stressed the hostages were a sensitive issue and 
he would avoid doing anything that might harm them

the number of american servicemen who died last 
year on active duty fell to its lowest total in more than a decade 
a new pentagon report shows 
the annual report found that military personnel did a better job 
during the year of avoiding training and offduty accidents the 
number of deaths attributed to illness or disease also declined 
although the number of suicides rose slightly 
all told the defense department charted 1833 deaths in fiscal 
1988 from all causes among the roughly 21 million men and women on 
active duty 
that total reflects a continuing peacetime trend toward falling 
death rates for example during the five previous years the number 
of military deaths totaled 1990 in fiscal 1987 2240 in fiscal 
1986 2017 in fiscal 1985 2313 in fiscal 1984 and 2204 in 
fiscal 1983 
the fiscal 1986 total was swollen by the deaths of 248 soldiers 
in a chartered airplane crash in gander newfoundland the fiscal 
1984 total jumped due to the hostile fire deaths of servicemen 
in the terrorist bombing of a marine barracks in beirut lebanon 
and casualties during the invasion of grenada 
the 1990 figure in fiscal 1987 was the lowest total charted at 
least since fiscal 1977 consolidated service figures for prior 
years are not readily available 
the latest report consisting of 172 pages of statistics was 
released by the pentagon on thursday it covers fiscal 1988 or the 
12month period from oct 1 1987 to sept 30 1988 and is 
entitled worldwide us active duty military personnel 
casualties 
the report lists five deaths attributed to hostile action during 
the year 
three of them involved navy sailors or officers who were killed 
in terrorist bombing incidents in italy spain and greece the other 
two were marine aviators killed when their cobra helicopter gunship 
was shot down last april during fighting in the persian gulf 
although the report does not detail specific deaths it does 
divide fatalities among various categories in such a way as to 
identify trends 
for example the study found that 1083 servicemen lost their 
lives accidentally in fiscal 1988 a decline compared to the 1153 
reported in fiscal 1987 
of the accidental deaths seven were attributed to alcohol or 
drug abuse in fiscal 1988 about the same as the six reported in 
fiscal 1987 the number of deaths attributed to aircraft accidents 
totaled 142 in fiscal 1988 down from the 173 reported the year 
before 
the leading cause of accidental deaths continued to be mishaps 
involving cars trucks and other vehicles of the total 1083 
accidental deaths during the year 778 were attributed to vehicle 
loss or accident 
there were 789 such vehicular deaths in fiscal 1987 
deaths attributed to illness or disease also declined with 314 
reported in fiscal 1988 compared to 394 the preceeding year heart 
attacks remained by far the predominant cause of illnessrelated 
death with 214 in fiscal 1988 compared to 249 in fiscal 1987 
the latest report charted an increase in the number of suicides 
among activeduty personnel rising from 247 in fiscal 1987 to 257 
last year the number of homicides remained static 95 in fiscal 
1988 compared to 98 in fiscal 1987 
continuing a trend of many years the study found that service 
members committing suicide relied almost exclusively on the use of a 
gun of the 257 suicides committed during the year 159 involved 
gunshot or small arms fire

when it comes to the federal deficit george 
bushs chosen budget director richard darman sees the problem 
differently than president reagan does 
at his confirmation hearing before the senate governmental 
affairs committee on thursday darman was asked whether he agreed 
with reagans characterization of an iron triangle consisting of 
congress the news media and special interest groups as the culprits 
for the governments huge budget imbalances 
it doesnt sound like a complete explanation he said after a 
long pause i think we probably need something larger than a 
triangle 
like a pentagon asked sen john glenn dohio the 
committees chairman 
it would have to be at least a hexagon he said but 
certainly these three would make any short list 
glenn asked darman if he believed the white house might also be 
included in any compilation of those responsible for the red ink 
that would probably make the list too he said 
reagan made his remarks in a speech dec 13 
darman spent most of the 1980s working in the reagan 
administration he is expected to receive senate confirmation to be 
director of the office of management and budget perhaps as early as 
wednesday

when the presidential torch is passed friday 
to george bush the transition will be quite unlike the inaugural 
experience of the nations second president one historian says 
when john adams was inaugurated he was furious said thomas 
o kelly chairman of american studies at siena college nobody 
was talking to him they were all going up to george washington to 
say goodbye 
there was even a goodbye party for washington from which 
adams was frozen out 
it wasnt washingtons fault i think they just forgot to 
invite him adams said kelly 
that snafu would repeat itself four years later in 1801 when 
thomas jefferson was inaugurated adams wasnt invited to that 
ball either 
a bitter campaign between herbert hoover and franklin d 
roosevelt left an icy barrier between the two at roosevelts 
inauguration in 1933 
fdr had been elected on a pledge to maintain a balanced 
budget kelly said adding that roosevelts campaign charges of 
mismanagement created the iceberg 
the worst inaugural ball that dubious honor goes to ulysses s 
grant after his election to a second term in 1873 
that ball with about 40000 worth of food and in those days 
the average day laborer earned between 400 and 500 a year was 
held in a temporary building but the weather contributed high wind 
and freezing temperatures 
there was no heat in the building so everyone went home 
early said kelly 
while the electronic news media has been kind to president 
reagan they would have been destructive for the countrys 16th 
president abraham lincoln had a bad speaking voice kelly 
explained 
he added that the sight of fdrs wheelchair also may have 
tarnished roosevelts popularity

surgeon general c everett koop said thursday 
he has no great fear of backalley abortionists if the supreme court 
overturns its 1973 decision legalizing abortions 
the national abortion federation criticized koop for diminishing 
the risks involved in illegal abortions 
koop interviewed on cbs this morning said the number of 
illegal abortion deaths was exaggerated by prochoice advocates when 
the high court issued its roe vs wade decision 
the greatest number of deaths ever in one year was 373 said 
koop an opponent of abortion thats a terrible number but it 
wasnt 10000 
koop said that doesnt mean that theres not going to be a 
black market and we dont have problems on our hands but he 
added that with the techniques that are being used by abortionists 
now those same techniques will be used in the future and they are 
safer 
he also said that if the supreme court returns control of 
abortions to the states it will open pandoras box because well 
have 50 problems instead of one 
the national abortion federation said forcing women to seek 
illegal abortions would create a serious public health problem 
whenever medicine goes underground complications and deaths 
rise not only would we have a pandoras box of legal issues but 
wed have a pandoras box of health issues we havent seen in the 
past 16 years said alice kirkman a spokeswoman for the 
federation 
the group agreed with koops assessment that giving control of 
abortions to states would create problems 
koop said if the decision is overturned it will go back to 
pre1973 where certain states will opt to be very liberal about 
abortions and others will clamp down and what it meant was that 
abortions were available on demand to people who could get to those 
states but they were essentially inaccessible to those who could 
not 
koop angered many antiabortion activists recently when he 
decided not to issue a report requested by president reagan on the 
health impact of abortion 
in a letter to the president earlier this month he said that 
among reagans advisers it was a foregone conclusion that the 
negative health effects of abortion on women were so overwhelming 
that the evidence would force the reversal of roe vs wade 
but koop said in the letter that no such scientific evidence 
exists he said that while anecdotal reports are plentiful to 
support both sides individual cases cannot be used to reach 
scientifically sound conclusions 
the supreme court last week agreed to hear an appeal that the 
justice department wants the court to use as a vehicle for 
overturning its landmark 1973 decision 
nancy broff of the national abortion rights action league said 
there are not good figures for pre1973 abortion deaths but she 
said koops estimate is extremely low 
she cited research that estimated as many as one death for every 
100 illegal abortions other research said that in 1955 between 
200000 and 12 million illegal abortions were performed in the 
united states 
and that doesnt take into account women who are mutilated and 
who suffered longterm health consequences from illegal abortions 
broff said

the state department disclosed thursday another 
us meeting had been held with the palestine liberation 
organization but no details of the contact in tunis were 
released 
i am not going to go into any specific agenda items 
department spokesman charles e redman said of the meeting he also 
refused to release the text of a statement in which plo chairman 
yasser arafat threatened to pump 10 bullets into the chest of anyone 
who tried to stem the palestinian unrest on the israeliheld west 
bank 
the reagan administration broke a 13year ban on us talks with 
the plo last month secretary of state george p shultz said the 
decision was based on a public statement by arafat renouncing 
terrorism in all forms and accepting israels right to exist 
robert pelletreau the us ambassador to tunis was designated 
the only official us channel to the plo although it was revealed 
later that restrictions had been lifted on other american officials 
meeting socially with plo representatives 
redman said the latest contact was a meeting tuesday in tunis 
between pelletreau and a plo representative he said it was not like 
the initial meeting in middecember but was more in the nature of 
an informal contact 
the spokesman declined to say whether the bombing of a pan am 
jumbo jet dec 21 was discussed a total of 270 passengers crew 
members and people on the ground died in the crash in scotland 
the plo has offered to assist in the bombing investigation plo 
representatives have been quoted as suggesting israel was behind the 
attack 
redman refused to say whether the plo had made the allegation 
directly to us officials or which side initiated the latest tunis 
meeting 
im just not going to go into the agenda he said as this 
develops i dont think youll find it unusual that there may be 
contacts of one kind or another initiated by one side or the other 
as this process develops the kind of things you will know about 
will be the real meetings the real dialogue 
he added i dont want to set the precedent of going into the 
agenda 
redmans disclosure of another usplo meeting came in response 
to a reporters question 
on wednesday again in response to a question he said the state 
department had obtained a tape recording in which arafat had said 
whoever thinks of stopping the intefadah before it achieve its 
goals i will give him 10 bullets in the chest 
intefadah is the arabic word for the violent 13month uprising 
by palestinian inhabitants of the west bank and gaza 
redman said wednesday that arafat has since denied he intended 
any threat against elias freij the mayor of bethlehem who is 
considered a moderate palestinian and was the purported target 
redman gave no indication the united states was reconsidering its 
decision to hold talks with the plo assistant secretary of state 
richard w murphy said last month the talks would be suspended if 
arafat reneged on his renunciation of terrorism 
redman refused to provide the text of arafats entire statement 
i read the particularly relevant part yesterday he said 
asked about the uprising itself the spokesman said we do not 
consider the intefadah terrorism redman also reiterated the us 
call for everybody to refrain from violence and to work for 
peace 
elaboratoring the us official said individual acts would 
have to be evaluated

president francois mitterrand of france 
met on thursday with 12 bulgarian human rights activists who asked 
for western help in relaxing their countrys rigid communist system 
the group invited to have breakfast with mitterrand at the french 
ambassadors residence included scientists writers artists and 
journalists some of whom belong to the communist party 
most are among the approximately 150 members of the club for the 
support of glasnost amd perestroika formed in november to promote 
the economic and social reform being pursued in the soviet union by 
president mikhail s gorbachev 
alexei chelutko a 65yearold academician delivered a letter to 
mitterrand that described official harassment of club members 
at a news conference with tolor zhivkov the bulgarian president 
and party chief at the end of his 36hour visit to bulgaria the 
french president said 
i would like to thank mr zhivkov and the bulgarian leadership 
because i was also able to meet those with different opinions those 
who approve and those who dont approve 
asked by a bulgarian television reporter what he thought of some 
french newspaper reports on bulgaria and its recent crackdown on 
dissidents he said the press is free and this sometimes creates 
inconveniences but less than the absence of freedom 
rabotnichesko delo the party newspaper carried an article 
thursday attacking some french reports on harassment of dissidents 
authorities detained about two dozen activists last week in 
plovdiv they were released after french diplomatic intervention but 
put under house arrest french officials said 
zhivkov said in an interview with the french daily le monde 
published wednesday that 25 people had been arrested he described 
them as criminals 
a french reporter asked him thursday when his government would 
allow bulgarians free travel to the west zhivkov replied no 
problem we signed the document in vienna and they will be able to 
come and go as they please 
in his speech at a state banquet wednesday evening mitterrand 
made a strong call for greater human rights with the declaration 
national sovereignty representative democracy separation of 
powers freedom and respect for individuals these values have lost 
nothing of their reality 
nikolai vassiliev a science professor who attended the meeting 
with mitterrand told reporters we discussed the problems in our 
social development we want our society to become more humanized and 
to find its place in the european house mentioned by gorbachev 
he quoted mitterrand as telling his visitors france cannot help 
solve our problem directly but would do its best indirectly 
vassiliev said french media could help by publicizing his groups 
activities 
french sources said the intellectuals told mitterrand they felt 
gorbachevstyle reform was the road bulgaria should take 
chelutko who presented the letter told reporters the club was 
not illegal and membership in it and communist party were 
compatible but said police persecution had begun 
in the letter to mitterrand he quoted zhivkov as saying the club 
would be left alone if it did not violate the law but added 
after our founding declaration and our meeting the clubs 
activity was completely paralyzed by police prosecutors and party 
organs 
after talking with the club members mitterrand went to sofia 
university and answered questions for 80 minutes from about 1000 
students packed into an auditorium 
the first question was what do you think about democracy and 
human rights in bulgaria 
mitterrand said he could not judge because he had arrived only 
wednesday but added to loud applause what is interesting is not 
my response but your question

the rev jerry falwell on thursday praised

is likely to continue the reagan legacy and will not bring any bad 
surprises for the countrys conservative movement 
i am convinced in my heart that george bush by osmosis just as 
ronald reagan 30 years ago has moved from he would say the 
center i would say a little left of center to where he is 
today falwell told a convention of students for america a 
conservative youth group 
and i think where he is today is clearly where ronald reagan is 
today the moral majority founder added 
falwell said he considers bush a better manager than reagan 
ronald reagan the visionary we needed eight years ago laid 
the foundation for it he gave us the dream falwell said but i 
see george bush as a handson very experienced manager 
he said everything he had heard from bush both in public and 
private tells me that we dont have any surprises upcoming i 
dont think any of us are going to be disappointed 
falwell expressed satisfaction with the health of the 
conservative movement saying that today more young people 
understand the bankruptcy of the liberal socialistic point of 
view that almost dominated this country 20 years ago 
all over washington today conservative young people and older 
people are here celebrating the reagan revolution and praying that 
the agenda will continue falwell said

experts say miami police have a good policy and 
training program on the use of deadly force but blacks claim there 
are problems with the way it is practiced 
being a black man in the city of miami is a dangerous 
occupation said ronnie hardman a resident of overtown where two 
nights of rioting followed the fatal shooting of a fleeing unarmed 
black motorcyclist by a hispanic officer 
miami gets high marks for its training of officers and its policy 
on the use of lethal force the amount of training is well above 
average and the department policy on the use of firearms is 
considered a national model 
it is a policy that by and large tells police officers not to 
use deadly force unless in defense of life and spells out when not 
to use your gun said james fyfe a criminologist at american 
university and an expert in the use of deadly force 
clement anthony lloyd 23 was fatally shot in the head by 
officer william lozano on monday lloyds passenger 24yearold 
allen blanchard died the following day of injuries suffered when 
the motorcycle crashed both men were black 
some witnesses claim lozano fired after the motorcycle passed 
him but lozanos attorney said lloyd was driving toward his client 
and that the officer shot in selfdefense officer lozano believed 
his life was threatened said roy black 
investigations are under way by the fbi state attorneys office 
and the citys department of internal affairs the city also agreed 
to set up an independent review board of police and overtown 
residents 
for many blacks the incident was the latest in a long line of 
clashes with police that has resulted in an usagainstthem 
mentality 
the police in this area shoot first and ask questions later 
when it comes to blacks said hilda mcphee 30 
in 1980 the acquittal of four white miami officers on 
manslaughter charges in the beating death of a 33yearold black man 
touched off three days of rioting in liberty city that left 18 
people dead 400 injured and some 100 million in damage 
in 1982 rioting erupted in overtown after the fatal shooting of 
a black man by a cubanborn police officer million of dollars in 
damages resulted more violence followed in 1984 after the officer 
was acquitted 
miller dawkins the miami city commissions only black member 
said blacks dont condone the latest rioting but added i have a 
problem with a policeman who shoots a man for a traffic violation 
raymond lang a police spokesman said department policy 
prohibits officers from shooting at moving vehicles unless it 
poses an imminent danger to their life or someone elses 
but lang said policy is sometimes hard to follow when an officer 
feels threatened 
you can teach someone in the classroom the principles of deadly 
force but when theyre out in the street and the adrenaline starts 
to pump and things are unfolding he said 
all south florida police officers attend a regional training 
institute where they receive a minimum of 800 hours of basic 
training nearly double that of some other jurisdictions said jim 
stinchcomb director of the southeast florida institute of criminal 
justice 
however kevin parsons a consultant in appleton wis who 
designs training programs for local and federal law enforcement 
agencies said training too often emphasizes the use of guns without 
offering alternatives 
far more often i see officers who did not have the skills to 
cope rather than officers who intentionally went out of their way to 
abuse someone because of race he said 
sgt mike mazur a 19year veteran of the force said police are 
likely to continue using deadly force 
theres no doubt in my mind police officers have to use 
force he said to chastise an officer for acting is wrong do 
you expect him to go down with the scum of the earth

state wildlife experts say a study that found a 
neighborhood with the highest concentration of lyme disease ever 
documented justifies their effort to allow hunters to thin the 
number of deer living in a refuge nearby 
but animal rights activists who fought hard to stop controlled 
deer hunting on the reserve say the study reported in thursdays 
new england journal of medicine hasnt changed their minds 
the study recorded the spread of the disease beginning about 1980 
among 190 people who lived along a road connecting the town of 
ipswich with the crane memorial reservation and wildlife refuge 
which was overrun with tickinfested deer 
we feel that it provides evidence that we know what were 
talking about and the things that we predicted came true in terms of 
not hunting said steve williams deer project leader for the 
massachusetts division of fisheries and wildlife 
lyme disease is caused by bacteria carried by bloodsucking ticks 
that feed on whitetailed deer and field mice the ticks also 
sometimes attach themselves to people and spread the bacteria 
state and reservation officials planned to begin controlled 
hunting to reduce the deer population on the 1400acre oceanside 
reserve in 1983 but hunting was delayed until 1985 after animal 
rights activists protested 
although the threat of lyme disease was a concern state 
officials were chiefly occupied with overbrowsing in the refuge 
accompanying erosion problems and starvation among the deer 
williams said 
activists contended there was enough food for the deer and also 
said that if the deer were starving they should be fed or moved 
rather than hunted 
the lyme disease study found the epidemic peaked in 1984 and 
1985 although people there continue to catch lyme disease experts 
believe that insecticides limited hunting in the reserve and 
increased awareness of ticks have helped diminish the disease 
the disease can cause a variety of seemingly unrelated symptoms 
including a rash headaches facial paralysis heart complications 
and arthritis it can be cured if treated early with penicillin 
researchers said the study shows how rapidly the disease can 
spread once it arrives in a community that has lots of deer 
but the study does not directly link deerreduction to a decrease 
in the disease said rob deblinger a wildlife ecologist who worked 
on the report he said researchers are still collecting data on 
whether there is a direct correlation 
thats speculative at this point said deblinger who works 
for a group called trustees of reservation which oversees the 
preserve 
wildlife activists said they arent convinced by the study 
its prevention thats making any kind of a difference because 
people are searching for these ticks said dorothy checchiobrien 
of plymouth all its hunting done is to allow hunters to have 
some fun over there

the communist party central committee on 
thursday released its statement on political and union freedoms 
which allows for legalizing the independent solidarity trade union 
here are excerpts from the statement translated by the official pap 
news agency 
the central committee considers it necessary to define a new 
formula of shaping political pluralism the formula of political 
pluralism should reflect differentiation and multitude of interests 
and political orientations as well as beliefs of particular social 
groups and circles be conducive to solving contradictions and 
disputes with no harm to the supreme values of the nation and law 
abidingly within state structures and not against them 
the central committee confirms the readiness of the polish united 
workers party the communist party to conduct dialogue and search 
for forms of agreement with any constructive political force if the 
latter irrespective of political orientation and ideological 
inspiration observes the countrys constitutional order and 
regards the prosperous future of the nation and the state as the 
supreme value 
to promote these principles and values it is possible and 
necessary to cooperate in materializing the tasks that unite rather 
than divide society and serve well the solving of polish 
civilizational and economic problems 
the central committee sees the need and the possibility to 
include constructive opposition in the political system 
the central committee comes out for strong and independent 
trade union movement we base our attitude towards the principle 
of trade union pluralism on the assumption that the trade unions 
will be such as the working people wish them to be 
while taking into account the progress made in the sphere of 
political dialogue and democratization of life in poland as well as 
the requirements of the countrys development the central committee 
comes out in favor of lifting in conditions of national agreement 
of restrictions on creating new trade unions provided that the 
new unions 
abide by the constitutional and legislative order and trade union 
statutes 
act in favor of economic development while being aware that 
production of goods is the condition for distribution 
rely on financial sources in tune with the law in force in poland 
and the principle of loyalty to their own state 
counteract attempts to violate social peace or to undermine the 
stability of the state 
the organizational shape of trade unions is an open question it 
requires discussion by all sides concerned 
it is also at the round table that conditions ways and timetable 
should be agreed concerning the introduction of trade union 
pluralism and opening up the way to creating new trade unions 
including solidarity which in the name of unity of interests of 
the working world would set up a joint representation visavis the 
economic administration in work establishments 
the central committee calls on all polish united workers party 
members and candidate members to actively support this stand

solidarity leader lech walesa told 
reporters on thursday that any agreement to legalize his banned 
union movement must preserve its independence 
walesa said he was being cautious before responding to the 
communist partys new position on trade unions and would have no 
answer to the party document until friday after he examined it 
he appeared upbeat and hopeful however as he addressed a packed 
room of reporters and supporters in st brygidas church in his home 
city of gdansk 
walesa spoke a few hours before a news conference in warsaw by 
polish leader gen wojciech jaruzelski at which jaruzelski unveiled 
the partys plan to legalize solidarity under conditions to be 
negotiated 
tomorrow i will try to say something when i see what its 
like said walesa winner of the 1983 nobel peace prize and a 
founder of solidarity the first free trade union movement in the 
east bloc 
solidarity was suspended when martial law was imposed in poland 
in december 1981 and was outlawed in 1982 
walesa said that under no condition would he accept an offer that 
deprives solidarity of its freedom of action 
after all the experiences losses and struggles we cannot give 
up our independence or sovereignty he said 
if we blow it here other people will have to deal with the 
same problem again i dont want my son or his generation to live 
through such things again where it all accumulates rots and then 
explodes 
we cannot destroy this chance by conceding too much but at 
the same time we should not struggle for some ambitious details 
legalization he said has become increasingly important because 
of poor economic conditions and deteriorating public moods 
the labor leader noted that a scattering of strikes took place in 
recent weeks and said he heard more strikes might be declared as 
early as monday 
he said that despair may bring desperate acts 
i treat soldaritys revival as very important very urgent and 
very timely an independent solidarity without any confinements in 
freedoms walesa went on 
i believe that solidarity will be wise and reasonable that it 
will understand whats necessary but i wont allow anybody to 
deprive it of its independence 
walesa said he saw some positive developments among authorities 
now everybody is convinced that poland really needs agreement 
based on principles of freedom and pluralism with as few 
limitations and confinements as possible and as much faith in 
peoples wisdom as possible he said 
he minimized the risk to the government of permitting legal 
operation of his union movement 
this is not the time when workers destroy machines or burn 
them today workers are much more sophisticated and they can 
understand others reasons but they must themselves be understood 
first he said 
working people in poland are able to take responsibility for 
development in a civilized and not destructive way i deeply believe 
it 
when pressed about his assessments of a communist party plenum 
this week walesa would make only general comments 
it seems to me that it provides too much to die on and too 
little to live on he said it is a lot for this party but 
it is too little for social demands 
he said it is easier for authorities to talk to an organization 
than to a shouting mob 
walesa continued conditions in poland give justification to 
every one of us to strike because the situation is so bad but 
reason shows that this leads nowhere 
i think that the opinion in poland is similar on all sides 
we have to create condition for good work for everyone in the 
country at the same time we have to respect their independence 
this is the only way we can develop and this seems to be 
understood

israeli soldiers killed a teenager suspected of 
inciting stonethrowers and 38 palestinians were reported wounded 
thursday two days after israel imposed tougher measures in the 
occupied territories 
west bank residents closed shops and offices to protest the 
sudden increase in the number of palestinians shot to death in the 
uprising against nearly 22 years of israeli rule 
the teenager shot to death in the gaza strip was the 14th 
palestinian killed by soldiers in a week bringing the total to at 
least 363 since the rebellion began dec 8 1987 fifteen israelis 
also have been slain 
soldiers are allowed to fire plastic and rubber bullets more 
freely under the new army policy which also provides harsher 
punishment for people throwing stones 
tougher sentences were given thursday israel radio reported 
it said two palestinians from ramallah in the west bank received 
sentences of 16 months and 18 months in jail for throwing stones 
which caused no damage at an israeli vehicle previously the usual 
sentence for stonethrowing was four to five months 
the new policy has drawn criticism from the united states and 
leftwing legislators in israel 
plo chairman yasser arafat said israel is forgetting that our 
people had decided from the beginning to continue the uprising until 
the end of the occupation so let us have more confrontation against 
the zionist occupation and the fascist hordes of murderous 
settlers 
in our steadfastness and faith the enemy faces its inevitable 
dilemma from which the way out is the retreat of its forces from 
the occupied lands he said in a statement issued in cyprus by the 
plo news agency wafa 
small groups of israeli activists from the peace now movement and 
yesh gvul which represents soldiers refusing to serve in the 
territories held silent vigils outside the defense ministry in tel 
aviv and government offices in jerusalem 
daddy what do you do in the occupied territories their 
posters read 
an army spokeswoman said 18yearold mohammed dahaise of gaza 
city was killed after he was identified as an inciter of a 
stonethrowing attack on soldiers in the nearby shati refugee camp 
the spokeswoman said dahaise died on the spot arab hospital 
officials said he was shot in the head 
israel has controlled the territories since the 1967 middle east 
war when it captured gaza from egypt and the west bank from jordan 
the occupied lands are home to 17 million palestinians 
in the west bank village of arraba 10 palestinians suffered 
gunshot wounds thursday in a clash set off by a demonstration 
against an alleged israeli collaborator arab reports said 
arab witnesses said arraba villagers stoned the home of a 
palestinian suspected of collaborating and that he emerged with a 
pistol wounding four of the stonethrowers 
israeli troops arrived and opened fire wounding six more 
villagers the witnesses said 
arab reporters said three villagers were wounded in a later 
confrontation in the area prompting the army to impose a curfew and 
confine the villages 5000 residents to their homes 
another army spokesman generally confirmed the account but would 
say only that several villagers were wounded 
arab reports said 25 other palestinians were wounded in clashes 
in the occupied lands thursday but the army spokeman confirmed 
eight injuries from other clashes in the occupied territories and 
said it was checking the other reports 
meanwhile a new group called the palestinian popular army issued 
a leaflet urging more attacks on the israeli army and the more than 
70000 jewish settlers who have built enclaves in the territories 
the group said it was allied with the uprisings underground 
leaders who generally support the palestine liberation organization 
in another development israeli defense minister yitzhak rabin 
unveiled what he called a personal program for a peace 
settlement in the occupied lands israel radio reported thursday 
it said rabin proposed a threetosix month halt in the uprising 
followed by elections to choose palestinian representatives who 
agree to negotiate a peace solution 
he said the territories should be placed in a federation with 
jordan or israel the radio reported 
the defense minister was also quoted as saying that jewish 
settlements in the occupied territories would not be uprooted and 
responsibility for security will remain in the hands of the israeli 
army

vice presidentelect dan quayle on thursday

exhilarating than to be shot at without result quayle told a 
group gathered in the lobby of the national museum of american 
history 
here we are ready to go to do the work that you and the 
people of america said they wanted us to do he said as costumed 
members of the us army old guard fife and drum corps stood behind 
him

the campaign uproar over quayles experience military record and 
other matters

friends at the museum an estimated 13000 supporters paid 20 
each to see quayle his wife marilyn and his parents and each of

regret about his own missed opportunities as student

had taken education more seriously quayle said

you i wish i had done differently he added 
the former indiana senator has acknowledged before that he was 
not the most serious student in his class but declined in the fall 
campaign to release his college grade transcripts 
his selection by bush to the republican ticket in august sparked 
controversy over his service in the national guard which allowed 
him to avoid military service in vietnam

presidentelect bush came from more than 700 schools nationwide

rewards said quayle who is among the heirs to a family newspaper 
fortune those rewards are opportunities

for greater opportunity

were together on a daytoday basis and i can tell you that his 
commitment to helping people and particularly to helping people

stands outside the white house then watch the festivities friday 
from the comfort of his living room 
littig 69 and his wife betty were strolling in the 
unseasonably warm sunshine when they heard that bush might be 
driving out of the white house soon 
a full hour later the alexandria va couple was front and 
center in the crowd that stood in the middle of pennsylvania avenue 
and cheered as the vice presidents limousine pulled out the 
driveway and bush his nose practically pressed against the glass 
gave a big wave 
we just stumbled onto this said littig we thought it 
would be nice to see it here today and watch it on tv tomorrow 
the littigs have been particularly pleased with the postelection

speeches than i was before it seems like hes sort of a 
practicaltype person that will give us the leadership he said

a 25 million fourday party celebrating 
george bushs inauguration is neither excessive nor inappropriate 
illinois gov james r thompson said thursday 
weve passed andy jacksons time when the president of the 
united states could say yall come on over and just throw open 
the doors of the white house the governor said at an 
inauguralweek breakfast 
were a different nation now thompson told his illinois 
audience and i dont think the nation minds if george bush begins 
his inaugural with a flyby over the lincoln memorial and fireworks 
thompson branded as sour grapes a complaint by former sen 
william proxmire dwis that private donors should have used the 
1500 they spent on the inaugural dinner to feed the poor instead 
the price for the dinner was not to buy 1500 worth of food 
obviously he said it goes to pay the expenses of the 
inaugural which includes many events which are free and open to the 
public whether youre a republican or a democrat

george bush on the eve of his swearingin as 
president said thursday he plans no instant domestic initiatives 
no first 100 days and isnt ready to entertain a new eastwest 
summit or arms talks pending a reassessment of superpower relations 
bush said his inaugural address after taking the presidential 
oath at noon friday would be a broad appeal to the american 
people to pitch in and help but without many specific calls to 
action 
bush met with news agency journalists at the white house prior to 
reporting to the oval office for his last meeting with president 
reagan as his subordinate after talking privately a weekly habit 
on thursdays for eight years the pair went to the roosevelt room 
to share their sentiments with senior white house aides 
according to spokesman marlin fitzwater bush said i wouldnt 
be the president if not for my teacher here and my friend 
reagan the spokesman said expressed equal warmth for his 
successor and quipped george never took my pulse once 
bushs upbeat mood was matched by washingtons glorious weather 
inaugural celebrants strolled to and fro without topcoats in the 
balmyforjanuary sunshine a mixture of sunshine and clouds with 
an afternoon chill was predicted for friday when bush takes the 
oath and more than 10000 performers join his parade to the white 
house 
four years ago the weather was so harsh that reagan had to be 
sworn in indoors and his inauguration parade was cancelled 
bush said his inaugural address will be an expression of 
satisfaction about how far weve come as a nation and a recognition 
that weve got a long way to go the presidentelect said in an 
interview at the same time he called the concept of a busy first 
100 days with congress one that doesnt really apply to a 
sitting vice president elected to the presidency 
he said too he is not ready to entertain the idea of meeting 
this year with soviet leader mikhail gorbachev and i dont think 
we know yet when us negotiators will be prepared to resume 
strategic arms reduction talks once set for feb 15 
i think the soviets understand that my intention is not to drag 
my feet but to simply do a prudent reassessment bush said i 
dont think progress should be measured solely on whether theres a 
summit meeting 
bush spent much of the day out of the public eye after a morning 
speech to high school students he promised he will do all in my 
power to help young people flourish saying americas best days 
are yet to come 
barbara bush and vice presidentelect dan quayle meanwhile took 
their special turns in the inaugural spotlight before joining their 
spouses and 12000 other blacktie revelers for a 9 million 
entertainment gala televised live to the nation by cbs 
the outgoing chief executive spent his last full day in office 
saying goodbyes meeting reporters he discussed a somber aspect of 
his presidency his failure to win the release of nine americans 
held hostage in lebanon some for nearly four years 
we dont know where they are reagan admitted saying any 
rescue attempt would have been foolhardy 
there hasnt been a moment that this hasnt been on my mind 
he told news service reporters 
bush appearing before the audience of top high school students 
from around the country borrowed a line from franklin delano 
roosevelt we cant always build a future for our youth but we 
can build our youth for the future 
he also talked about americans characteristic optimism and said 
no one better personifies that than a president named ronald 
reagan whose shoes are going to be pretty darn hard to fill 
quayle appearing separately before the same students made a 
confession as one looks back at life ill be the first to admit 
i wish i had taken education more seriously 
in the capitol where workers buffed the heavy mahogany doors 
through which reagan will usher his successor the senate foreign 
relations committee unanimously approved bushs senior cabinet 
appointee secretary of statedesignate james a baker iii who had 
appealed during confirmation hearings this week for a restoration of 
bipartisanship in foreign policy 
mrs bush 63 an ample whitehaired grandmother whose 
trademark is a threestrand chocker of artificial pearls wowed 
12000 guests who spilled into the three main halls of the john f 
kennedy center for a 50aperson salute to the first lady 
she took note of the elegant surroundings then said speaking 
of glamor i want you all to look at me very carefully striking 
coquettish expression she continued please notice the hair the 
makeup the designer clothes with that she whipped open the coat 
of her blue suit revealing a patterned lining to match her scarf 
the audience roared then burst into ovation when she added 
look at me and remember you may never see it again 
she also exacted no small revenge for the playful chiding she 
took from her husband on wednesday when bush repeatedly told 
audiences she was getting mean and tough and ugly about making 
him do household chores especially packing for the move 
this is a good day for me to set something straight mrs 
bush said george went around town all day yesterday telling that 
story about the rigors of packing 
who remembers where george bush was last weekend fishing so 
much for the packing story he wont dare tell that story again 
the blacktie invitationonly gala at the washington convention 
center was expected to draw a television audience of 40 million 
people headliners for the primetime extravaganza included frank 
sinatra ballet star mikhail baryshnikov the mormon tabernacle 
choir and two bush favorites country singers loretta lynn and the 
oak ridge boys 
comedian bob hope the grand marshal for fridays inaugural 
parade down pennsylvania avenue was summoned for a surprise 
appearance at the gala expected to gross 9 million in ticket sales 
and revenues from tv commercials that will help defray the 
estimated 25 million in total costs for the inaugural festivities 
guests at the gala were paying as much as 250 per seat 
depending on location and 25000 for an eightseat box close 
to the stage crowned by a canopy emblazoned with gold stars 
bush laughed at himself in his talk to the high school students 
i certainly learned the importance of education during the 
campaign he said i learned how vital it is to memorize dates 
pearl harbor day for example bush got that one woefully wrong 
during the campaign 
but if bush has straightened out his dates he still needs help 
on names he told the youngsters he hopes to do better in his 
inaugural address than benjamin harrison did he spoke for an hour 
and a half and then got pneumonia and died a few weeks later 
actually that was william henry harrison benjamins grandfather

people with few assets but extensive holdings 
in us savings bonds can improperly establish medicaid eligibility 
and receive benefits under the federal insurance program for the 
poor according to a report thursday 
the general accounting office a congressional watchdog agency 
recommended the government expand a verification system that 
compares income declared by public assistance program applicants and 
beneficiaries with information from certain federal agencies 
though applicants are required to report savings bond holdings 
those who dont escape the verification system because it doesnt 
include us treasury data on bond holdings and that data currently 
is not available to the states the gao said 
the report did not estimate the number of medicaid recipients 
nationwide who have savings bond holdings over the amount allowed 
for eligibility 
the agency matched the records of 29213 medicaid nursing home 
residents in massachusetts as of dec 31 1984 with us treasury 
records and found 143 had unreported savings bond holdings exceeding 
the 2000 limit as of april 1986 
the outstanding bonds were worth a total of about 15 million 
with individual holdings ranging from 2000 to 60000 the gao 
report said 
also 262 of the medicaid recipients had redeemed 2000 or more 
in bonds or had a combination or outstanding and redeemed bonds 
worth 2000 or more with outstanding bonds of less than 2000 the 
report said however the gao could not determine when the cash from 
the redeemed bonds was disposed of 
applicants for medicaid are required to disclose on their initial 
application all income and assets including assets disposed of 
during the previous two years medicaid agencies also conduct annual 
reviews to verify continued eligibility of recipients 
our work in massachusetts showed that the potential exists for 
individuals with extensive bond holdings to improperly establish 
medicaid eligibility the gao said 
the problem the gao said is with the income and eligibility 
verification system each state is required to have such a system to 
compare the income declared by program applicants with information 
from the internal revenue service and the social security 
administration 
the shared information includes interest earned on redeemed 
savings bonds and on bonds paying periodic interest but it does not 
include the value of us savings bond holdings

research veterinarians are trying to pin 
down the cause of mysterious tumors threatening the survival of 
endangered green sea turtles off florida and around the hawaiian 
islands 
the incidence of the tumors has greatly increased during the 
past seven years said dr elliott jacobson wildlife specialist 
at the university of floridas college of veterinary medicine in a 
statement thursday 
the best information we have so far suggests theyre caused by 
a virus and at the moment were seeking to isolate a virus from 
the tissues of affected turtles he said 
the efforts of jacobson and coinvestigator dr jack gaskin are 
supported by grants from the private save a turtle group in the 
florida keys and save the turtle of chicago 
jacobson said the tumor epidemic is a particular threat to the 
already endangered green sea turtle 
the tumors have been spotted on about half the green sea 
turtles found along the indian river lagoon system said jacobson 
referring to the 100milelong stretch of waterways protected by 
barrier islands along floridas central atlantic coast 
he said the same percentage of affected sea turtles has been 
reported in hawaii by biologist george balazs of the national marine 
fisheries service 
the tumors develop over both the soft body tissue and shell of 
the turtle often appearing on and around their eyes 
dr peter pritchard vice president of the florida audubon 
society and an expert on green sea turtles said the disease now 
threatens only certain sea turtle populations but others are not 
immune 
the potential for the disease to spread through migration is 
definitely there he said

a chopsticks plant that was hailed at its 
1986 opening for boldness in taking on the japanese in the foreign 
trade war is 7 million in debt and closed for repairs after losing 
35 million in 1988 
the heavily subsidized plant in this mining town in severe 
decline was shut down dec 15 and its 65 employees were laid off 
because of faulty equipment said ian ward the company president 
machinery intended to speed production was vibrating and spoiling 
the chopsticks veneer said ward president of lakewood forest 
products the vancouver british columbia owner of the plant 
ward said a new machine is being built and is expected to be 
installed by the end of january production will resume in early 
february he said 
japanese buyers of the chopsticks havent gotten discouraged and 
will buy as many sets as the plant can produce said don myers a 
lakewood spokesman in canada 
lakewood originally said it would employ up to 120 workers and 
produce up to 7 million pairs of disposable chopsticks a day but it 
was making about 700000 pairs a day when it closed myers said 
the iron range resources and rehabilitation board loaned 34 
million to the company in december 1985 to help get the plant 
started the company also got about 1 million in loans grants and 
free land from the city and state 
jim benson a planner with the irrrb development agency which 
issued industrial revenue bonds to make the loan said he will visit 
the plant friday its been a concern thats why we make site 
visits benson said thursday weve been over there monthly for 
the past six months 
the chopsticks plant which has a contract to supply a consortium 
of japanese buyers lost 35 million in 1988 on sales of 420000 
said myers the plant is worth about 13 million he said the 
company is a total of 7 million in debt ward said 
production problems have plagued the operation since its june 
1986 opening 
new problems surfaced in july 1988 when the plant installed a new 
lathe ward said in a telephone interview from vancouver an 
adjoining machine called a reeler made vibrations that disturbed 
the lathes finishing work he said 
the manufacturer of the reeler which was supposed to be an 
improvement over the plants original model is buiding a new one at 
no cost to lakewood ward said 
the city faced with a severe decline in the mining of iron ore 
gave lakewood a 225000 grant 10 free acres of land a 250000 
loan and 275000 in taxincrement financing to get it started 
hibbing city administrator harry gherarei said the state loaned the 
company an additional 250000 he said 
lakewood recently raised about 603000 in stock offerings to be 
used to restart production myers said 
once this one is up and running we may build a second or third 
plant myers said

even after a judge ruled in his favor last 
month and the movie the thin blue line questioned his guilt 
convicted police killer randall dale adams doesnt expect his 
imprisonment to end soon 
adams has spent more than 12 years in state prison mostly at the 
eastham unit a vast prison farm in east texas sometimes called 
americas toughest for the 1976 killing of dallas officer robert 
wood 
dont think 13 years is the ending to it because its not 
said adams 40 who has been serving a life sentence since his death 
sentence was commuted in 1980 this is the beginning of the end 
but its taken 13 years to get back to square one 
after a dallas hearing in which the key witness changed his 
testimony saying adams wasnt even in the car wood stopped just 
before he was gunned down state district judge larry baraka ruled 
in december that adams did not receive a fair trial the judge 
recommended he be granted a new one or set free 
listening to the evidence theres reasonable evidence to 
believe the mans not guilty or didnt get a fair trial the judge 
said as far as im concerned its all done over 
but the texas court of criminal appeals could take as long as two 
years to act upon barakas recommendation attorneys say 
if adams is granted a new trial baraka said he doubts the state 
would pursue the case because so many witnesses have changed their 
stories 
adams and his houston attorney randy schaffer also are trying 
to enlist officials to ask the state board of pardons and paroles 
for a pardon recommendation 
then there is parole which has been denied eight times most 
recently on jan 10 according to state records 
parole board spokeswoman karin armstrong said adams case would 
next be up for official review in december but she said as early 
as march his case could get special reviews which the board is 
conducting because of prison crowding 
adams says he tries to draw a line between his private life and 
the publicity from thin blue line which brought out new 
evidence by putting his court proceedings out of mind 
i cant just sit at my house cell and think of this all day 
long he said 
for the time being adams says he is glad to be where he is 
it may be the toughest prison in america according to 
newsweek but im happy to walk the halls of eastham he said 
you know texas wanted to execute me in 79 so each day past that 
is a day that im alive

it will cost more to clean up the hanford 
nuclear reservation in the state of washington than any other 
governmentowned plant the energy department said thursday 
cleaning up hanfords radioactive and toxic wastes could cost 
between 37 billion and 57 billion over the next 50 years and even 
then the site wouldnt be returned to a pristine condition the 
department said in a report prepared at the request of sen john 
glenn dohio 
the new report provided sitebysite estimates for improving 
safety health and environmental conditions at energy department 
facilities 
earlier this month the department said the cost for all the 
plants in the country could be 91 billion to 200 billion 
for some plants the new report provided higher cleanup estimates 
for known problem areas for hanford the report boosted the 
official inventory of cleanup problems 
the report said about 440000 cubic yards of highlevel 
radioactive waste is stored at hanford it also said about 1500 
inactive hazardous waste sites including nine old reactors and 
processing facilities have been found on the reservation where raw 
materials for nuclear weapons have been produced since the days of 
the manhattan project 
they doe keep changing the math complained rep ron wyden 
dore two years ago they said there were 1000 hazardous waste 
sites now they are saying 1500 
we hope this report will provide substantial impetus for 
congress to provide the funding said chris sankey a department 
spokeswoman 
glenn pressed budget directordesignate richard darman to make 
the same commitment 
we cant put it off glenn told darman during a confirmation 
hearing before the senate governmental affairs committee which 
glenn chairs this is really a tragic situation 
we have several hundred thousand people around these plants 
and workers at these sites that are truly at risk and i dont think 
we have the option just morally as a nation to ignore that and put 
it off over a 35 or a 40year period 
darman said presidentelect bush had asked him to meet with 
energy department officials and begin working on the issue 
glenn called the problems at the governments network of nuclear 
bomb factories nothing less than an environmental time bomb 
following are the energy departments sitebysite estimates for 
the cost of improving conditions at the various facilities 
for each site the list provides the maximum length of time 
expected cost and the agencys highest projected cost depending on 
the interpretation of what is required

here are excerpts from presidentelect bushs 
interview thursday with a group of news organizations 
q how long are you going to let the start talks hang and do 
you think you risk losing the momentum that president reagan 
achieved 
a i dont think we risk losing momentum that president reagan 
achieved because i think the soviets understand that my intention is 
not to drag my feet but to simply do a prudent reassessment and in 
terms of how long i dont think we know yet 
i dont feel inclined to adopt a timetable at this point we may 
be able to do that in a week or two just have a better feel for 
when these things will be finished 
but youve got to realize we dont have a lot of the people in 
place whose views will be required on a reassessment so well go 
forward with whatever the assets are in defense and in state and in 
the nsc but all of these bureaucracies are in a state of change 
so my main point is i think the soviets understand this i made 
it very clear to general secretary gorbachev that there was that 
this reassessment in no way was a footdragging operation exercise 
q does that mean that the talks themselves cannot be resumed 
until that review is completed 
a there may be things that could be accomplished to really move 
forward on talks that have already made progress we have to finish 
our review 
q do you think its going to be six months a year 
a have no way cant help you dont know one of the first 
things ill do as president is order this review 
q what are odds of talks with mr gorbachev this year 
a i dont think we can make the odds and more important than 
that that we have good sound positions that we will be advocating 
and whether that results in a summit or not i think is less 
important than the fact that the process will go forward i 
dont think that progress should be measured solely on whether 
theres a summit meeting 
q president reagan said yesterday that we should consider 
renegotiating the panama canal treaties if noriega remains in power 
how do you feel about that 
a i think we need to go slow on all that the treaty has certain 
obligations that ought to be met im a great believer that once a 
treaty is entered into and ratified it ought to be kept 
but id have to look at the treaty before i have any commment on 
something like that 
q did you think process of filling senior jobs might be more 
complete by now 
a in terms of undersecretaries and department heads i know 
were about where we thought wed be on the cabinet on the rest of 
it i dont know what a historical precedent was id like to be 
further ahead put it that way but i think were doing all right on 
it 
q what would you like to accomplish in the first 100 days 
a i keep saying ours is different only martin van buren and 
i really know how different it is and he aint talking im not 
shooting for any 100 days and i think its kind of a concept that 
doesnt really apply some may want it to apply 
q what do hope to accomplish then as you first take control 
a i hope to see progress made on the budget this is the no 1 
domestic economic problem facing the country so were going to have 
to move forward on that in terms of negotiations with the congress 
im not quite naive enough to believe theyll accept everything ill 
propose in february 
and then well have some things we will accomplish in the 
first few months ethics legislation will be part of it id like to 
see some action on not only formulating the policy but taking 
certain steps toward more accomplishment and understanding in the 
environmental field 
well see the drug antinarcotics operation get geared up in 
that first few months there and i think weve got to have a good 
plan there that shows a seriousness that surely i feel 
educational initiatives are important but they wont be simply 
adding to the federal spending account 
monies are not going to be there to do all the things i want to 
do and that i feel are priority so well have to sort through and 
set priorities some of what i want to do will have to wait on a 
solution to the budget question 
q how do you see that being solved 
a i see it being solved through negotiation i think youre 
going to have serious negotiation and even then youre not going 
to do this in a year obviously 
if we can get a good agreement on the budget i think the 
psychology of that will have an ameliorating effect on these 
interest rates 
and i think the problem will be easier once world markets see 
agreement has been reached and it is clear the us government is 
determined to get the deficit down 
q will your campaign proposal to reduce the capital gains tax be 
in your budget plan 
a yes there are some technical things that have to be done but 
yes it will have to be there 
q the state department tape of arafat threatening people with 
ten bullets whats your reaction 
a id like to see the context of the tape before commenting but 
clearly that does not facilitate improving relations with arafat so 
i want to see it i dont know what the context of that but just 
from what ive read id say its a setback to peace rather than an 
enhancement of peace 
q will you authorize resumption of usplo contacts 
a im not going to change the policy i supported the policy it 
was part of what i wanted that policy will not change in terms 
of when you need more talks i think each talk should be on a 
casebycase basis and well just see what will facilitate the 
peace dialogue 
i cant tell you about the tape because i havent read it or 
listened to it or know what the context of it is but if its a 
reversion to supporting international terror that could foul up the 
dialogue 
q will you maintain the present policy of benign neglect toward 
hostages 
a i will maintain the policy of leaving no stone unturned for 
the release of the hostages but that policy has another side of it 
and that is we will not buckle under to the demands that are being 
thrown out there by those that are holding the hostages 
q can you give us some idea of the message the tone you will 
strike tomorrow 
a ive got it pretty well in my mind now the text is locked in 
all but locked in 
it will be just a broad appeal to the american people to pitch in 
and help itll be an expression of satisfaction about how far weve 
come as a nation and a recognition that weve got a long way to go 
it will be a reemphasis of my conviction that many of these 
problems that remain unsolved can best be solved by engagement of 
the private thousand points of light concept the private entities 
that do things so much better than government and that have done so 
much to solve pressing problems 
it will be along those thematic lines im now an expert on 
inaugural addresses in terms of numbers of words as well as themes 
most of them at least the modern ones are pretty much the same in 
that context broad and thematic as opposed to point specific 
q are there any concrete actions you will take tomorrow 
afternoon 
a there may be but they wont be of major import ill go to 
work though just as i always have 
q will you continue the saturday radio addresses 
a i think were not going to do those we may later on 
q will you be wandering out of the white house for 
spurofthemoment trips in the evening and weekends 
a i cant pledge to be anchored down but id like to work out 
some understanding that the worlds not going to come to a 
screeching halt if you dont know that im eating peking duck over 
in virginia some place 
and you may not agree with that but i think its silly to have 
to feel that when the president goes out of that thing for a private 
supper or to eat in a restaurant that serious journalists or 
their editors feel that the nations business will come to a halt 
if that is not reported 
im not going to give up my ability to make up a decision in a 
hurry 
whats being protected you mean if i fall over and choke in the 
restaurant suppose i fall over and choke in the white house 
youre not there

the homeless lined up for a soupkitchen meal 
wednesday outside union station where wealthy republicans gathered 
for a 1500aplate feast of maryland crab and roast loin of pork 
with george bush and dan quayle 
three hours before the start of the candlelight inaugural dinner 
several hundred street people enjoyed a counter inaugural 
banquet of hot chili and rice tortilla chips salad and apple 
cider on the plaza in front of union station 
while they ate off of paper plates the homeless listened to 
guitar players and watched a proabortion street theater featuring a 
man in tennis shoes wearing a bush mask and a sign reading i 
oppose abortion hanging around his neck 
protesters organized by a group called the counterinaugural 
coalition for a peoples agenda carried placards reading food 
not bombs george knew and the skies are for stars not 
war another sign under a huge peace symbol read now appearing 
in a fouryear show son of reaganstein costarring big bird 
us park police said the demonstrators were being dispersed when 
the inaugural dinner in the newlyrefurbished station began in 
midevening 
the presidentelect and his vice president quayle were guests 
of honor at the lavish dinner attended by more than 2500 republican 
stalwarts and fatcat contributors the blacktie crowd was so large 
the dinner was held at union station and the nearby pension building 
and corcoran gallery of art 
for 1500 ticket each invited guest was to hear brief remarks 
by bush and quayle at the dinner sites and feast on a fourcourse 
dinner 
outside on the plaza park police sgt robert kass banished a 
half dozen conservative republican counterdemonstrators for lack of 
a permit 
the leader of the group eugene delgaudio 34 executive director 
of the private ultraconservative activists group known as public 
advocate said he wanted to show theres a better way than 
openly political negativism he said his demonstrators were to 
welcome the blacktie dinner guests with american flags and signs 
reading welcome nonliberals 
several homeless people paused between spoonfuls of chili to say 
that the 225 million in proceeds from the inaugural dinners should 
be spent to provide food additional shelters job training and 
subsidized public transportation for washingtons street people 
referring to the inaugural diners roosevelt carrington a 
30yearold homeless person said i think maybe they should eat 
the same thing were having so theyll know what its like 
said ronnie thompson 38 they done robbed most of it from 
us he said the inaugural dinner proceeds should be used for the 
homeless because a lot of them have given up 
more than 1000 people were served at the counterinaugural 
dinner at union station 
as guests began arriving shortly before 7 pm several hundred 
of the people at the counterinaugural banquet began shouting 
what about the homeless and 50000 dead from aids where was 
george 
although the park police allowed the demonstration to spread 
closer to the train depot than the demonstrators permit allowed 
the protestors remained 100 yards from the entrance where the 
invited guests were emerging from their cars and were barely audible 
from that distance 
at about 730 pm one half hour before the union station 
banquet would get officially underway the park police received 
reinforcement and barricades which were set up in front of the 
demonstrators 
park police sgt g f wallace asked whether the barricades had 
been planned in advance said im not in on these decisions but 
i imagine it was spontaneous because of the crowds activitywe 
cant have the police spread out or people can sneak through we 
should have had them up there before 
there was no indication that any of the invited guests to the 
union station dinner were even aware of the demonstration none of 
them came over to see what is going on 
at the majestic corcoran gallery of art dinner guests who also 
paid 1500 each were serenaded up a royal blue carpeted stairway by 
violins playing this could be the start of something big 
elegantly attired guests wandered through art displays ranging 
from modern neon art to traditional american pieces the gallery was 
hung with blue bunting with white stars and large arrangements of 
red roses decorated the corridors 
among the guests were sen john warner rva and bushs son 
marvin and his wife margaret the younger bush said he was having 
fun but mostly waiting for fridays swearing in of his father 
the rest will be fun he said adding however the one we 
will all be looking forward to will be friday an incredibly proud 
moment for all of us 
his wife who wore a fitted strapless black gown with a brocade 
bodice said she had never seen george and barbara bush so excited 
as they have been with the inauguration approaching theyre like

the north korean told lee the pyongyang government intends to 
give active support for joint venture projects between business 
companies of the two sides the announcement said

group will be two executives specializing in civil engineering and 
plant construction

south korean businessman to be invited by pyongyang to visit the 
north since the korean peninsula was divided into communist north 
and capitalist south in 1945 when soviet and us troops ended 
japans colonial rule over korea 
observers in seoul believe the north is under pressure to revive 
its sagging economy even with investment from south korea the north 
reportedly owes about 5 billion to communistbloc as well as

norths invitation was aimed at stirring up antius and 
antigovernment activism

promote exchanges between south and north korea 
the festival held every four years is a major political arts 
and sports event involving mostly communist and third world nations

us cultural center in kwangju which has been attacked by radical 
students seven times since last year

kwangju mayor choi inki on thursday after yesterdays attack on 
the kwangju cultural center we think it may be time to reconsider 
whether to keep it any longer 
the mayor disagreed telling brooks it is not proper to 
consider the attack as the intention of the entire citizenry 
yonhap added 
kwangju 180 miles southwest of seoul is the capital of south 
cholla province 
about 50 students attacked the center with firebombs and rocks on 
wednesday no one was hurt but damage was done 
the students accuse the united states of complicity in the harsh 
military suppression of a bloody civil uprising in kwangju in 1980 
america denies it

island territory threatened to ram it 
fernand leborgne president of the french fishing company 
comapeche broke a fiveday deadlock in the dispute by ordering the

adviser to st pierre and miquelon a group of eight frenchowned 
islands for the time being we are happy but nothing is over 
the 6000 people living on the rocky archipelago 10 miles south 
of newfoundland rely almost entirely on fishing for their 
livelihood last fall a compromise in a longrunning dispute 
allowed one factory ship from france to fish in the zone

allowed the grande hermine to fish in the zone another trawler the 
victor plevin also owned by comapeche has been fishing in the area 
since early january 
the fishermen charge the factory ships take in too many fish and 
dont provide any employment at the territorys fish processing 
plants 
the grand hermine will stay away from the area during a new round 
of negotiations between the territory and paris comapeche officials

entire crews of airliners on longhaul flights have 
been found to be asleep the civil aviation authority said thursday 
in announcing new controls to prevent overwork by pilots 
it said a study found evidence that some pilots worked too many 
hours and some crews had constant changes in their rosters 
dr geoffrey bennett the authoritys chief medical officer 
said i can remember seeing one or two reports when the whole crew 
were asleep while a longhaul aircraft was cruising 
if asked any longhaul pilot of 20 years experience will say 
that at some stage he will have woken up and found the whole crew 
asleep this is not to say there is any great deal of hazard in 
this 
many necessary flight functions are computerized in todays 
airliners 
bennett said there was discussion of captains arranging 
organized naps for crew members during long flights 
civil aviation authority guidelines to be introduced in april 
result from a study of 10 airline tour operators last summer that 
showed existing rules were being exploited 
while saying no rules were broken and safety was not at risk the 
authority made clear there were instances of duty periods for pilots 
being extended sometimes as a matter of course rather than to meet 
exceptional circumstances

crowds returned to the streets of miami on thursday 
night not for civil disobedience but rather for slam dunk and 
michael jordan 
people streamed in to the area surrounding miami arena for the 
national basketball association game between the miami heat and the 
chicago bulls 
the game was a test of whether this city had calmed after three 
nights of looting burning and rock throwing that followed the 
police shooting of a black motorcyclist just 12 blocks from the 
arena 
the soldout game came two nights after officials canceled a heat 
contest with the phoenix suns 
we had no concern about coming down here at all said glen 
haft who brought his wife and son we thought things had calmed 
down we were sure the police would make sure there were no 
problems 
hafts son david 11 had been looking forward to the game 
featuring slamdunk artist michael jordans only miami appearance 
this year but confessed he feared he might miss the game 
i was afraid i was going to get bottles and rocks and sticks 
thrown at us but it hasnt happened so far david said 
there was no indication of trouble in the area surrounding the 
new pastel pink stadium about 100 police officers 60 more than 
usual maintained a highly visible presence and there were no 
incidents 
the 52 million 15000seat stadium opened last summer and it 
and its nba tenant were an instant success 
fifteen of the heats 18 games home games have been sellouts a 
19th game was canceled because of the riots monday thursday nights 
game had sold out in october 18 minutes after tickets went on sale 
but empty seats in the arena were still visible at halftime 
indicating some noshows 
the arena is an important part of plans to revitalize the 
neighborhood and bring people back to the citys downtown 
construction has already begun on an apartment building complex for 
people who work in the city the arena is designed as the anchor of 
that project 
but not all the fans thought the location of the arena on the 
edge of overtown was that wise 
its a good place i just think they should have put it some 
place else said dwayne burgard they should have known 
something like this would happen 
city boosters were anxious for the night to go smoothly 
its absolutely critical that the game takes place tonight 
said bill collom president of the greater miami chamber of 
commerce its just got to take place 
the street vendors and ticket scalpers had similar sentiments 
one tshirt seller said he lost hundreds of dollars when tuesday 
nights game was canceled 
raymond scales a city school counselor had a good night by 
selling out of tshirts that read i survived the miami riot 
i dont think people had much to worry about here tonight 
said scales i think its good they put the arena here this area 
needs to be revitalized

president mikhail s gorbachevs reforms 
contributed to a 17 percent increase in the soviet crime rate last 
year the interior minister was quoted thursday as saying 
robberies assaults and theft of personal property increased in 
frequency by more than a third interior minister vadium bakatin 
said in an interview in the communist party newspaper pravda 
attacks on police increased and street crime rose by more than 40 
percent said bakatin who supervises the soviet unions uniformed 
police 
in his first major interview since taking over in october he 
said police themselves were often corrupt and illprepared to fight 
crime 
under gorbachev officials and the state media have been more 
open about reporting drug abuse prostitution and other crimes 
including details of criminal investigations 
but bakatins halfpage interview in pravda was an important 
admission that reform has brought problems as well 
he said the reforms have created complicated at times painful 
processes of selfcleansing an increase in civil and ethnic 
selfawareness 
two republics where ethnic awareness is growing most rapidly 
latvia and estonia headed the areas where bakatin said crime is 
growing most rapidly 
he also cited several times the violence between armenians and 
azerbaijanis where interior ministry troops were called in to 
restore order 
many criminals released from labor colonies under legal reforms 
have been unable to find work because state industries are cutting 
back their workforces to meet efficiency demands of gorbachevs 
economic reforms he said some return to crime 
bakatin also said police are illprepared to cope with organized 
crime seeping into the cooperative movement of private enterprise 
which gorbachev has encouraged to provide goods and services not 
available under the state economy 
bakatin gave no figures for the number of crimes committed but 
said it can be stated boldly that the level of crime in the 
country is significantly higher than statistics indicate today 
he also said the police system should be reformed 
we have everything in the system of the ministry of internal 
affairs bribery treachery bureaucratism callousness rudeness 
departmental separatism and illegality he said 
some local police have tried to keep the number of crimes they 
report as low as possible fearing that reporting an increase will 
damage their careers he said

taba israelegypt border ap negotiators reported progress on 
the taba border dispute after opening talks were delayed for 90 
minutes thursday by a squabble over whether egyptian delegates would 
arrive in a car with israeli or egyptian license plates 
the egyptians finally drove up in a un bus accompanied by 
jeeps from both countries 
the two sides finally sat down to discuss the border strip of 
taba with its israelibuilt luxury hotel and holiday village and 
later reported progress on the issue of access by israeli tourists 
to the 250acre resort strip 
abraham sofaer the us mediator said he expects a compromise 
can be reached 
the focus on access for israelis suggested the strip could wind 
up in egypts hands after straining israeliegyptian relations for 
six years 
reuven merhav the chief israeli negotiator reported progress 
in the mutual issues we discussed and arrangements regarding access 
by israelis 
he said the agreed points would be summarized in fridays round 
of negotiations as an initial agreement 
nabil el arabi head of the egyptian delegation told reporters 
i dont see any problem to finishing the negotiations in two 
days he said only very small items were left to discuss 
we would like israeli tourists to come here not only by the 
tens of thousands but by the tens and hundreds of thousands said 
arabi 
taba came under israeli rule when israel captured the sinai 
peninsula during the 1967 middle east war in 1982 israel withdrew 
from all of sinai except taba following the 1979 israeliegyptian 
peace treaty 
the dispute was submitted to international arbitration in 
september the arbitrators awarded egypt key border points but said 
they were not authorized to determine a final marker that includes 
the beach resort 
the two countries are negotiating over where to place the last 
marker 
the talks are also supposed to develop a framework for egyptian 
purchase of the sonesta hotel with the final deal to be worked out 
by negotiations involving the hotel owners 
as talks were going on a group of israeli yacht owners sailed 
along the taba coastline to demand free water access an israeli 
gunboat chased them away 
about 50 israelis from nearby elat symbolically marked the border 
by stretching a rope that put taba within israel one protester was 
detained israel radio said

north is challenging efforts by prosecutors in the irancontra case 
to subpoena the notebooks he compiled of his daily activities at the 
nsc the judge in the case disclosed thursday

that norths filing outlining his opposition would be sealed to 
protect references to a grand jury transcript the filing was made

gesell had earlier scheduled a hearing for next wednesday in the 
event that north opposed the subpoena for the notebooks which 
detail his involvement in the contra resupply operation as well as 
the reagan administrations arms sales to iran 
north used the spiralbound stenographers notebooks from feb 1

iran arms sales had been diverted to the contras fighting the 
leftist government in nicaragua 
portions of the notebooks were turned over to the congressional 
irancontra investigating committees and disclosed during hearings 
but north through his attorney brendan sullivan invoked his

president reagan will get to look a gift horse in 
the mouth after all 
after professing ignorance of the impending gift most of the day 
the government finally confirmed thursday evening that it plans to 
send the outgoing president a horse from the royal canadian mounted 
police 
the first hint the gift was planned came wednesday when the 
white house staff presented reagan with new harnesses for the horses 
at his ranch near santa barbara calif 
reagan held aloft the leather gear and said when i get home i 
understand the canadian mounted police are delivering a horse this 
will take care of that horse 
but the mounties the prime ministers office and the department 
of external affairs said all day thursday they knew nothing of the 
gift possibly because of a us law preventing presidents from 
accepting gifts while in office 
after fridays inauguration of presidentelect george bush the 
restrictions are gone 
late thursday a spokesman for prime minister brian mulroneys 
office said i can now tell you that the president is getting a 
horse when he ceases to be president thats all i can tell you

blacktie guests at thursday nights gala in 
honor of george bushs inauguration sniffed that it wasnt 
appropriate as their festive evening got off to a dissonant 
start with protesters screaming bush quayle you cant hide we 
charge you with genocide 
some three dozen demonstrators from gay and lesbian rights 
groups armed with a megaphone taunted the furbedecked partygoers 
as they waited in long lines to get through security screenings at 
the convention center 
fifty thousand dead from aids where was george they 
screamed along with money for aids not for inaugurals and 
someone you love will die for aids where will you be 
police asked organizers to keep the circle moving to clear an 
area of sidewalk for passersby and to turn the megaphone down a bit 
they complied only with the first two requests but police said 
nothing further about the decibel level 
the reason were here is that 32 million is being spent on the 
inauguration said robert bray of washington a spokesman for the 
demonstrators we want to call attention to the fact that theres 
a huge problem george bush must face he has been handed this 
legacy by former president reagan and he has to handle it 
signs lofted by the protesters were direct the government has 
blood on its hands one aids death every half hour 
i dont think its appropriate at all said tom aubrey of the 
american bankers association one of 12000 guests at the nationally 
televised gala featuring frank sinatra chuck yeager loretta lynn 
and randy travis among others i dont think a celebratory 
evening is the time or place for this kind of demonstration 
i think they like trying to rain on somebody elses parade 
commented doug richardson who works with the transition for 
transportation secretarydesignate samuel skinner 
jeff vogt of arlington va who has been tapped for a job in the 
white house public liaison office asked for silence please 
theres a time and place for it 
protesters angry with gop policies of all kinds are staging 
alternative events throughout the week 
so far the protests have been peaceful 
a gathering of hundreds wednesday night outside union station 
where some 2500 republicans attended a 1500aplate gala 
featured free food and chants such as what about the homeless 
but no violence 
that was the plan said an organizer of the counterinaugural 
coalition for a peoples agenda which has some 80 member groups 
ranging from the gray panthers to the committee in solidarity with 
the people of el salvador 
the coalitions members including the gay and lesbian rights 
groups demonstrating thursday night had agreed in advance not to 
conduct any civil disobedience 
we want to ensure that we maintain a positive attitude 
coalition spokeswoman lisa fithian said 
thursday night a no honeymoon concert benefiting the 
christic institute which has sued the us government over its 
central america policies and activities charged 25 per ticket 
entertainers david crosby and graham nash were featured 
demonstrators planned to be out in force inauguration day along 
with the national organization for women which has scheduled a 
silent protest along the parade route 
the now demonstrators were to wear buttons numbered 1 to 1000 
that light up in rebuke to bushs oftstated reliance on a 
thousand points of light the buttons will carry the message 
keep abortion legal 
we want mr bush to know this is a remobilization that were 
not going to stand by and see what little rights we have whittled 
away said now spokeswoman junior bridge 
bridge said a survey of the parade route revealed little access 
to those without tickets the public is obviously not a welcome 
part of this inauguration she said 
the northwest corner of lafayette square across the street from 
the white house has been set aside for demonstrations but there is 
no hourbyhour schedule of who will be able to use the space 
the extravagance of george bushs inauguration by far the 
most expensive in us history demonstrates how far removed the 
bushquayle administration is from the concerns and worries of most 
american people fithian said 
courtney miller an organizer with justice for janitors part of 
the coalition noted that his people have a role in the inauguration 
festivities but not one that gets much attention 
these are the people who will be at the inaugural parties after 
the glitz and glitter is shut down miller said 
the coalition whose slogan is 1000 sparks of dissent 
inaugurate a peoples agenda plans a counterinaugural ball at 
the crispus attucks museum on friday night with a 6 to 10 
admission on saturday the coalition will hold a counterinaugural 
forum at all souls church followed on sunday by an interfaith 
gathering outside the national cathedral featuring traditional 
native american prayers from representatives of the piscataway 
nation 
the coalitions groups include american arab antidiscrimination 
committee antifur coalition dc statehood party student coalition 
against apartheid and racism environmental action jobs with peace 
national coalition for the homeless national gay and lesbian task 
force national pledge of resistance peace park antinuclear vigil 
socialist party usa united farm workers vietnam veterans against 
the war women strike for peace and womens international league for 
peace and freedom 
many of those groups as well as mitch snyder of the community 
for creative nonviolence have called on bush to ask those who 
donated money for the inauguration to donate an equal amount to 
solve some of the problems facing the country 
and some just want the nations policies changed 
ken butigan of the national pledge of resistance said george 
bush read our lips the us war in central america must end 
what ronald reagan learned during eight years was that there is no 
mandate for war 
daniel becker legislative counsel of environmental action 
called on bush to change the policies of the administration he has

michael francke 42 who was found dead outside his office early 
wednesday had received death threats on a regular basis a 
friend said

patrick purdy the gunman who killed five 
southeast asian children in a crowded schoolyard had no grudge 
against any particular ethnic group just a hate for everybody 
police said thursday 
thirty other people were wounded in tuesdays attack at cleveland 
elementary school which ended when purdy a loner with drug and 
alcohol problems and a fascination with all things military killed 
himself 
most of his victims were children of southeast asian refugees 
but capt dennis perry said through his lifetime mr purdy 
developed a hate for everybody 
perry said purdys enemy list apparently varied from day to day 
he might be mad at one group but the next day if he talked to joe 
dokes and he talked about the lebanese he probably didnt like 
them either 
purdy was described as a danger to himself and others and 
suffering from mild mental retardation in a mental health report 
prepared after his arrest in el dorado county in 1987 perry said 
arrested for firing at trees with a pistol he tried to hang himself 
and slit his wrists while in custody authorities said 
perry described purdy who attended the school as a boy as a 
loner no friends no particularly known girlfriends a problem 
with alcohol a problem with marijuana and a distinct dislike for 
everybody not a particular race everybody 
in a way he beat us because well never know why he did it 
said perry chief of the investigation 
purdy 26 slipped into the schoolyard after detonating a pipe 
bomb in his battered station wagon he fired more than 100 bullets 
with a chinesemade semiautomatic ak47 assault rifle before taking 
his own life with a pistol 
the five youngsters killed were all children of southeast asian 
refugees 
hospital officials said a 6yearold boy wounded in the groin was 
upgraded from serious to stable condition thursday seven pupils 
were in stable condition and six others including a teacher were 
listed in fair condition four more people were discharged from 
hospitals thursday officials said 
steve sloan who worked with purdy at a stockton machine shop 
said thursday he remembered a conversation in which purdy expressed 
his dismay at how well vietnamese refugees were treated in the 
united states 
we allow vietnames to come in and we give them a place of 
residence and a car and money and help to find a job sloan said 
in describing purdys attitude 
im sure he did harbor a dislike for vietnamese sloan added 
but said purdy never singled out any racial or ethnic groups 
he expressed hatred and bitterness and anger towards just about 
anybody who asked him to do something sloan said adding that 
purdy appeared to feel he was being dealt a short deck 
it always seemed like he was on the edge of snapping he said 
perry said autopsy results on purdy would not be available until 
next week but that there was no immediate evidence of hard drug use 
purdy had purchased a number of weapons in the past four years 
including several smallcaliber pistols and a 9mm semiautomatic 
mac10 perry said 
in the shabby motel room where purdy lived his last few weeks 
police found about 100 toy soldiers and other military toys and a 
camouflage cloth scrawled with grimacing faces 
when he attacked the school he was wearing an olive drab tshirt 
with the iranian battle cry death to the great satin an

psychologists say mass murderers like the 
drifter who sprayed rifle fire at his boyhood school are part of a 
recent unprecedented wave of grandstand suicides expressing a 
hairtrigger anger at the world 
but some experts warn that such acts of violence whether they 
represent a copycat trend or are only isolated incidents should not 
turn the nations schools into armed camps 
the issue took on new significance as police investigated the 
motivations of patrick purdy a drifter who returned to his former 
elementary school on tuesday and opened fire on a crowd of children 
killing five students and wounding 30 people before killing himself 
for these people it is typically their last chance to show 
society how angry they are michael mantell chief psychologist 
for the san diego police department said wednesday striking 
out at children is their way of building up their flagging egos by 
taking out their frustration on young victims

the rate of increase in consumer prices held 
steady in 1988 at 44 percent the government said thursday but 
many economists are warning that inflation could accelarate 
moderately this year 
although the rise in the labor departments consumer price index 
last year was identical to the 1987 gain the reasons were very 
different 
the summer drought pushed food prices up by 52 percent in 1988 
compared with 35 percent a year earlier last years gain was the 
steepest since 1980 consumers got a break on energy costs which 
rose a scant 05 percent compared with 82 percent in 1987 
the inflation rate excluding the volatile food and energy 
catagories a compilation many economists say is a better gauge of 
underlying inflationary pressure than the larger index did 
accelarate from 42 percent in 1987 to 47 percent last year

the image of a dour shoeless english boy 
and his absent carefree mother prompted julia baird and geoffrey 
giuliano to collaborate on a book 
the boy is the public image of young john lennon bairds 
halfbrother and giulianos idol but the neglected urchin and his 
liveitup mother who was also bairds mother never existed the 
authors say 
that woman laughing singing dancing saying goodbye to john 
and john standing there alone crying mummy mummy thats not my 
brother thats not my mother thats not my childrens 
grandmother said baird who recently spent three weeks in the 
united states promoting her book a family portrait of lennon and 
his liverpool roots 
published in north america last fall john lennon my brother 
was coauthored by giuliano a beatles aficionado who lives in this 
erie canal city about 25 miles north of buffalo 
the twoyear crossatlantic collaboration came from two 
different motives giuliano wanted to do a book about lennon baird 
wanted to do a book about the exbeatles maligned mother whose 
name also was julia 
the result is a little of both a mishmash of anecdotes showing a 
moody but generally happy liverpool boy singing with his mother in a 
bathroom with good acoustics 
baird disagrees with other biographies which say that after his 
father decamped and julia turned her son over to her sister mimi 
lennon was a grim youth who felt abandoned by his mother 
i didnt do it for john said baird i wanted to set the 
record straight about our mother and that ties in with john i feel 
my mother has been badly misrepresented in the press 
baird a 41yearold teacher in cheshire england was born seven 
years after lennon to julia and her commonlaw second husband john 
dykins she and her younger sister jacqui grew up with their 
parents amid an extended family of aunts uncles cousins and big 
brother john 
the book tells of the sisters getting hauled out of the bathtub 
when teenagers lennon paul mccartney and george harrison drop by 
for bathroom jam sessions with julia it tells of an alternately 
thoughtless and protective brother who leaves his stepsisters at 
the movies for hours while he goes on a date who between songs at a 
beatles concert shouts for security guards to lift the dykins girls 
out of the front row away from screaming fans threatening to storm 
the stage 
but mostly it tells of a mother and son who while living apart 
had a loving relationship 
the book got its start after baird watched a british television 
special in 1985 marking the fifth anniversary of lennons murder 
the show presented julia as an unfit mother no mother at all 
baird said 
baird complained and was urged to tell her story she wrote an 
essay and arranged to publish it in liverpool then she met 
giuliano who was in liverpool to promote his first book the 
beatles a celebration 
giuliano 35 a selfproclaimed huckster convinced baird to work 
with him on a book which he pieced together from interviews with 
baird in england while proofreading the text baird sent a copy to 
mccartney he sent his blessing plus a bonus a brief foreword for 
the book 
with a collection of rare early photos the book is more a family 
album than a biography giulianos text reads like oral history as 
if a british schoolteacher had spread the family scrapbook across 
the readers knees to boast about her brother the musician 
however the book is a narrow view of lennon a childs 
recollections of an aspiring brother after julia was killed in a 
traffic accident in 1958 baird saw less and less of lennon losing 
contact with him for years when he and wife yoko ono moved to the 
united states the end of the book describes what baird calls 
lennons desire to regain his lost liverpool roots when she and her 
stepbrother exchanged letters and phone calls during 197580 
baird has been accused of cashing in on her stepbrother but 
insists she just wants to tell the familys story of lennons early 
years 
i could have cashed in when john was alive baird said 
when john died the tabloids in england were knocking on the door 
saying write your story name your price we quickly showed them 
the door 
also shown the door was albert goldman whose sordid biography 
the lives of john lennon hit bookstores about the same time as 
bairds book baird who read goldmans scathing biography of elvis 
presley said she turned down an interview with goldman who brands 
lennon homosexual anorexic and possibly a murderer 
i had heard goldman was doing the book six years ago and i 
knew what the tone would be baird said most people including 
goldman write books based on other books that have it all wrong 
giuliano was harsher 
goldman was in it for the money from day one giuliano said 
goldman knows the formula the more sleaze the more dough so 
whats his motive if he writes the sleaziest book he makes the most 
dough 
baird herself wasnt blind to the business end of publishing she 
agreed to change the title from my brother john to john 
lennon my brother 
the covers lookalike photos of baird and lennon in granny specs 
also help but she said she didnt don them to sell books theyre 
on the national health britains medical plan and she and lennon 
inherited their mothers shortsightedness baird said 
the book itself is a loving look through rosecolored specs of a 
brother whose art touched millions 
its not a major biography giuliano said this book is a 
little slice out of a big pie out of a big life it offers a lot of 
previously unknown details on lennons early life its a 
sympathetic view sure but whats not to love

hollywood stardom with a stopover in a mansion on the erie canal 
where hes writing portraits of the artists who influenced him 
at the moment the actorturnedauthor is writing his fourth book 
on the beatles dark horse the secret life of george harrison 
five years ago giuliano was living in toronto out of work and 
out of money the 35yearold had played roles from shakespeare to 
ronald mcdonald on stages from england to florida he had cut two 
offbeat rock albums developed a pilot for a british comedy tv show 
and exhibited his collage art across canada he also had met george 
harrison and paul and linda mccartney and interviewed yoko ono and 
sean lennon for playgirl magazine 
still he was broke on a whim he called a publisher in toronto 
saying he had one of the worlds largest collections of beatles 
artifacts inside contacts with the musicians and were they 
interested in a book 
they were and the result was the beatles a celebration a 
slick oversized valentine of a book published in 1986 by methuen 
publishing in canada and st martins press in the united states 
his next book my brother john lennon written with the 
slain beatles stepsister julia baird came out last fall 
giulianos tomorrow never knows the beatles recorded rarities 
is in production and a canadian publisher stoddard general has 
bought the harrison biography 
the book will be the authoritative biography the onestop 
shopping place for those seeking information on harrison giuliano 
boasts 
giuliano his wife and their three children moved to lockport 
two years ago living in an 1850s canalside mansion he bought and 
restored with his book profits the mansion has become something of 
a monastery he says after dark horse he plans to scale back 
his writing to a book every three or four years so he can focus on 
acting 
he plans to move to los angeles next year hoping to break into 
movies and bring some intelligence to hollywood 
giuliano admits he has a bloated ego and turns it on anyone or 
anything he lumps in with the modern age of mediocrity the media 
trivializes american life and are largely at fault for making 
people today far more superficial and covetous than their 
parents 
my wifes parents had clear plastic over their furniture weve 
got it over our minds giuliano said 
giulianos beatles books have been something of a thank you 
to the group that helped him keep the plastic off his own mind but 
dark horse will be his last book on the group he says 
i acknowledge the gift the beatles gave me giuliano said 
ive spent a few years trying to get others to understand them 
but now i want to move on already im a little embarrassed i feel 
like ive stayed at the fair too long ive been on the magical

bullfrog county pop 0 was born at 3 
am on the last day of the 1987 nevada legislature and died last 
year in court 
the legislators invention a new locality levying the states 
highest taxes on the proposed site of the nations first highlevel 
nuclear waste dump proved unconstitutional but the idea of making 
the federal government pay for choosing nevada lives on 
i dont know of any current proposal out there but i think that 
if we have to take the dump we should be compensated for it 
assembly taxation comittee chairman bob price said as the 1989 
session opened jan 16 
some believe nevada could begin collecting taxlike fees from the 
federal government as it tests the proposed site whether the 
underground repository is built there or not said senate taxation 
committee chairman charlie joerg i think wed be foolish not to 
look into the possibility of collecting money from the government 
we should get some benefit from this 
a resolution from the 1987 legislature resurfaced in the senate 
on opening day this year it would establish a special tax district 
around the site to let the state collect 5 per 100 of assessed 
valuation as if the respository were a private project the rate is 
the maximum allowed by the nevada constitution and about three times 
the local levy around the proposed tax district 
backers of the assessment plan want money in lieu of taxes to 
offset the impact on local governments which would have to provide 
housing education law enforcement and other services for people 
working at the 2 billion dump 
assembly speaker joe dini said lawmakers should move cautiously 
to avoid sending a signal to washington that nevadans are willing to 
accept the nations nuclear garbage weve had advice that if we 
try to get money out of the federal government it will weaken our 
position to fight the dump 
assemblywoman myrna williams introduced a resolution with 35 
cosponsors urging congress to halt the dump williams blasted a 
measure introduced in the state senate to negotiate with the 
government saying it implies consent 
in 1987 congress passed legislation directing the department of 
energy to concentrate on yucca mountain as a place to bury spent 
fuel from nuclear power plants the site 110 miles northwest of las 
vegas could be licensed in 1995 
the legislature responded by carving 144 square miles out of nye 
county as a way to let the state collect the maximum property tax 
rate that could have cost the federal government an estimated 8 
million to 25 million a year 
bullfrog county inhabited by rattlesnakes coyotes lynx 
kangaroo rats and lizards but no humans was named after a nye 
county mining district that failed in a bid to become a separate 
county nearly 80 years ago it was given a threemember commission 
and a county seat 250 miles away in carson city 
nye county sued the state challenging bullfrogs creation on 37 
different legal grounds in a 92page brief its major claim was that 
because bullfrog had no residents it had no representative 
government and was unconstitutional it also contended that it was 
entitled to any money collected 
nye county should be compensated more we have to recognize 
mitigating factors because they would be closest to the dump said 
joerg 
retired nevada supreme court justice david zenoff ruled feb 11 
1988 after 30 minutes of oral agruments that bullfrog county was 
unconstitutional he said it stretched its legal limits every 
which way and left too many constitutional issues hanging in 
the air 
the legislator who introduced the bullfrog county bill former 
assemblyman paul may did not run for reelection 
former gov richard bryan who signed the bill was elected to 
the us senate in november he has vowed to use his new position to 
force reevaluation of the process that singled out yucca mountain 
from among three candidates the other two were in deaf smith 
county texas and near hanford wash 
the first investigative drilling into yucca mountain has been 
delayed five months to november 1989 as government scientists 
struggle for the first time with rules that govern civilian nuclear 
plants the energy departments weaponsbuilding activities are 
exempt from nuclear regulatory commission rules

after more than three years of being grounded 
by dread a nervous but determined phil dehart boarded a plane a few 
days before christmas so he could spend the holiday with relatives 
in indiana 
he wouldnt have been able to get on that jet he says if it 
werent for a new book designed to ease fearful flyers fears 
the book tells you the more you understand something the 
less you fear it i think thats one of the things that helped 
me the 35yearold painting contractor said 
fly without fear a 172page psychology paperback written by 
the directors of usairs fearful flyers program is helping 
countless others cope with aviaphobia or just plain apprehension 
studies show one in six americans is afraid to fly making it one of 
the two or three things people fear most 
its the next best thing to the class that we do said capt 
frank petee a former pilot who is director of special projects for 
usair 
petee and carol stauffer a clinical social worker based fly 
without fear on the sevenweek program they launched here in 1975 
some 3000 people have taken the course and 97 percent of them 
report success 
the course is offered in only 10 us cities a year so when we 
get a call from someone in minnesota and theyre desperate like 
these people are theres nothing to offer them said ms 
stauffer now they have a book 
one person helped by the course was patricia hass an editor at 
dodd mead amp co who asked them to write the book dodd mead 
released it in november but petee and ms stauffer have taken over 
distribution from the liquidating publisher 
like the program fly without fear describes the mechanics of 
flying and the reason for turbulence it also discusses the four 
main fears of flying acrophobia or fear of heights 
claustrophobia or fear of closed spaces fear of crashing or dying 
and fear of not being in control it suggests relaxation techniques 
and other methods for overcoming them 
the book also emphasizes air safety an average 18000 commercial 
flights carry 1 million people daily in the united states generally 
without incident said ms stauffer its by far the safest way 
one can travel 
knowing the odds as well as something about the process of flying 
comforted dehart during a week that unnerved even the most fearless 
flyers 
after twice poring over fly without fear dehart flew dec 21 
from his home in phoenix to indianapolis that was a few hours 
before a bomb aboard pan american world airways flight 103 exploded 
in the sky over scotland 
he returned dec 26 the day an eastern airlines boeing 727 was 
forced to land in charleston wva with a 14inch hole torn in its 
fuselage 
thats bad timing for anyone but especially for someone whose 
fear stemmed from the misfortune of being at airports within a few 
hours or days of crashes 
dehart passed through dallasfort worth international airport on 
aug 3 1985 a day after a delta air lines jumbo jet crashed 
killing 137 people i could see all the wreckage out there he 
said 
i made a vow to myself i wasnt going to get on another 
airplane 
accidents tend to push borderline fearful flyers over the 
edge said ms stauffer its just so awesome to think about if 
you already have some fear inside you brewing there something like 
that is enough to set it off 
petee acknowledges his job undoubtedly will be tougher from 
here on in because of the pan am bombing and recent accidents 
quite often you have to revert back to the fact that these 
things happening like this are so far and few between they really 
are he said when you go back 25 to 30 years only 2 percent of 
accidents were caused by maintenancerelated incidents only 2 
percent

perhaps to welcome the bush administration cbs 
offers a kindler gentler new tv series 
dolphin cove premiering saturday is a nice family drama 
with a splash of sophistication mixed in with all the sappiness 
this is a show for people who still cry at the end of old 
yeller not cynics who watch miami vice in the secret hope 
that tubbs will shoot crockett 
frank converse stars as michael larson a scientist who moves to 
australia under the aegis of a wealthy businessman who wants to 
prove that dolphins are as intelligent as human beings 
if viewers arent immediately caught up in the drama of flipper 
fielding flash cards there are the more accessible concerns of the 
scientists two children young katie who lost her will to speak 
after being in a car wreck that killed her mother and david a 
sulky teenager who wants to go home to his girlfriend in america 
trey ames a year in the life plays david and karron graves 
is katie nick tate plays baron trent the sponsor of the research 
project who harbors a secret plan to salvage a valuable ancient 
sunken ship 
peter benchley author of jaws is one of the creators of the 
series which is filmed on location in australia he also wrote the 
premiere so its hard to predict the quality of subsequent episodes 
once the family arrives in australia they meet hired hand didge 
ernie dingo an aborigine who rides horses flies a helicopter and 
generally helps explain the strange new land 
they settle in sort of to mosquito nets there used to be 
vultures but the mosquitoes ate them didge explains and pizza 
topped with alligator meat 
larson dives into his work but two bottlenosed dolphins in his 
care only make fun of him by splashing him with water and squealing 
what apparently is dolphinese for nyah nyah nyah but they 
take to silent katie and establish an etlike rapport with her 
david meanwhile is appalled at being sent in uniform to st 
crispins which his father neglected to tell him is an allboys 
school the girls go to st somewhere else larson explains 
oh good st elsewhere this gets better all the time sulks 
david the inside joke is a reference to coexecutive producer john 
masius a former writerproducer on st elsewhere 
on to high drama though when katies new therapist allison 
mitchell virginia hey clumsily makes a reference to her own 
mother causing katie to run off and swim into the dangerous ocean 
but it is we who are plunged into the depths of 
lassiecomehomeness when the wise dolphins leap a barrier and 
race out into the deep to rescue the mute child and her teacher 
if thats not enough to bring tears to your eyes the episode 
ends with katie watching an old videotaped home movie of her mother 
count the number of fathers raising kids alone on tv and it begins 
to look like moms are an endangered species 
the dolphins might not speak english but they sure know how to 
overact if the series goes theyll no doubt be demanding 
renegotiation of their contracts and greater creative control 
but the human characters seem a likable bunch and dolphin 
cove is not a bad place to visit and thanks to remote control you 
dont have to live there

prayer by evangelist billy graham at todays inauguration of 
george bush as us president asks that he be given a cool head 
and warm heart and the uncompromising courage to do whats 
right 
although inaugural ceremonies usually feature a crosssection of 
religious participants only the veteran evangelist was singled out 
for it this time asking a divine hand on the new president 
in this momentous hour of our history give him the wisdom 
integrity and courage to help this become a nation that is gentle 
and kind implores the text of the opening prayer 
protect him from physical danger and in the lonely moments of 
decision grant him thy wisdom to know what is morally right and an 
uncompromising courage to do it 
give him a cool head and a warm heart give him a compassion 
for those in physical moral and spiritual need 
graham asked about being the only clergym commissioners meeting in 
emergency session wednesday 
appointed a panel with subpoena power to investigate the fatal 
shooting of an unarmed 23yearold black motorcyclist by a hispanic 
policeman and the sister of the motorcyclists passenger who died 
after the vehicle crashed made a televised appeal for an end to the 
violence 
put down your weapons i do not want my brother to be 
remembered with the riots claudia lubrin said on local television 
the rioting that followed the killing has left one person dead 
eight shot about 20 buildings burned and numerous others looted in 
the black neighborhoods 
it also has left imageconscious city officials scrambling to 
minimize the impact on sundays super bowl the cincinnati bengals 
remained at their downtown hotel just blocks from the overtown 
disturbances 
what has happened the last two days has certainly taken the 
glitter off the super bowl said dick anderson a former miami 
dolphin player and chairman of a host city committee spending 2 
million this week to enhance miamis image 
thats really what life is over there said bengals 
quarterback boomer esiason it really puts this game in 
perspective 
police deployed about 450 officers and worked to meet sporadic 
outbreaks of violence with shows of force field forces of 
officers clad in bulletproof vests and riot gear were stationed on 
the edge of the riottorn neighborhoods caravans of squad cars 
raced through the areas and swat teams searched for troublemakers 
we hope we can normalize and go back to routine patrolling 
said deputy police chief walter martinez we dont like being out 
here 12 hours and being shot at 
speaking at the city commission meeting mayor xavier suarez 
apologized to police for actions that may have endangered their 
lives unduly 
suarez didnt elaborate at the meeting but he told the new york 
times that he may have erred when he allowed the sister of the dead 
motorcyclist to view her brothers body shortly after he was shot 
monday night the times reported today he said her reaction 
appeared to incite a group of nearby youths who showered police 
with bottles 
i took the sister over to the deceased suarez said i 
should have done that under more controlled circumstances all the 
kids followed me things got out of hand i dont believe what i did 
was the trigger in fact i may have helped for a while by going 
there and talking to people but i would have done it differently if 
i had it to do all over again 
the times said suarez later called to say that he had not 
intended those comments for publication 
black leaders warned suarez before the commission meeting 
wednesday that their community would no longer accept empty promises 
and business as usual 
the word is out that there will be more disturbance said the 
rev william washington now weve got to act and act quick 
commissioners unanimously approved the special panel to 
investigate the shooting of clement lloyd who was speeding with a 
friend allen blanchard through overtown blanchard died in a 
hospital tuesday of injuries from the motorcycle crash 
after discussions the commissioners approved a suggestion by 
miller dawkins the lone black on the fivemember commission who 
wanted a board consisting of five policemen and five overtown 
residents with the mayor as chairman 
dawkins said the board will not satisfy the young people throwing 
rocks and bottles and he appealed to them for time 
id like to tell them to give us a chance to work this out and 
to work on all our other ills such as poor housing poor education 
joblessness he said and they have to work with us instead of 
creating other problems like they are doing now 
the fbi the state attorneys office and the police internal 
review board are also investigating the police shooting william 
lozano 29 the colombianborn police officer who shot the 
motorcyclist in the head was relieved of duty with pay pending the 
investigation 
anderson said on abcs nightline that his department had 
major concerns about the shooting 
there seem to be some unusual circumstances the police chief 
said 
most schools that closed tuesday reopened although attendance 
was down 
liberty city was the site of a 1980 race riot also linked to the 
death of a black motorcylist at the hands of white police officers 
the 1980 uprising left 18 people dead in 1982 a riot in overtown 
sparked by a police shooting caused millions of dollars of damage to 
businesses and buildings

convenienceconscious americans have made salad 
bars one of the most popular new supermarket innovations in recent 
years and with some care these shoppers can also realize value for 
their money 
salad bar ingredients have proven popular not just for salads 
but also as ingredients in stirfry dishes side dishes sandwich 
fillings and the raw materials for a hearty soup say researchers 
eileen patz newman and dianne d odland 
nutritionists at the department of agriculture decided to look 
into the growth of supermarket salad bars and studied those at 
markets in the washington dc area 
they found that some items not surprisingly cost a lot more on 
the salad bar than they do if purchased in larger units in other 
sections of the market 
but other items cost about the same and shoppers could even find 
savings on some items at the salad bar the researchers reported in 
the magazine family economics review 
the difference exists of course because salad bars generally 
charge one per pound price for whatever ingredients the customer 
selects while prices for the same items bought individually would 
vary widely 
cucumbers carrots green cabbage yellow onions and watermelon 
for example were as much as four times more expensive at the salad 
bar 
and saladbar buyers paid triple the regular price for lettuce 
celery bean sprouts red cabbage zuccini canned kidney beans and 
peas cole slaw macaroni salad potato salad and hardcooked eggs 
the researchers said 
tomatoes spinach radishes green pepper cantaloupe sliced 
beets chickpeas raisins pineapple tofu egg salad and cottage 
cheese cost about double if bought at the salad bar 
on the other hand mushrooms cauliflower broccoli spring 
onions strawberries honeydew grapefruit peaches pears 
threebean salad pickled beets salsa and rice pudding cost about 
the same at the salad bar as in other supermarket areas 
and the nutritionists found that shoppers could actually save 
money at the salad bar by buying alfalfa sprouts pineapple 
mandarin orange slices tuna fish american cheese domestic ham 
sunflowwr seeds croutons chow mein noodles jalapeno peppers 
pitted olives and bread pudding 
while their research concentrated on supermarkets in the 
washington area shoppers in any part of the country might also find 
savings by comparing perpound costs of salad bar foods to the same 
item in other sections 
a straight price comparison isnt always valid of course 
because at the salad bar shoppers can buy any quantity of an item 
then need eliminating potential waste 
this can be especially important for one and twoperson 
households or those who prepare meals at home infrequently buyers 
from those homes need to consider whether they can use an entire 
head of cauliflower or carton of cottage cheese or if much of it 
will end up thrown away eventually negating the saving 
another consideration is time since saladbar ingredients are 
already cut up and prepared this may be an advantage for the cook 
who needs items for a stirfry dinner and doesnt want to spend the 
time slicing and chopping 
sale prices and local price differences also make a difference 
the researchers pointed out 
but the final conclusion is that basic salad ingredients are most 
costly at the salad bar while salad toppings and products of animal 
origin can offer a saving there 
thus consumers anxious to make the best use of their shopping 
dollar and who have time and storage space might want to consider 
buying items like lettuce carrots and cabbage at the regular 
produce counter and turning to the salad bar for the extras such as 
tuna ham sprouts cheese and croutons

youll forgive nevada film chief robert hirsch 
if he shows a special interest in the academy award nominations this 
year 
some of the years leading movies films likely to capture a 
nomination or two including the hit rain man used nevada 
locales during 1988 a record year for hirschs state motion 
picture division 
i picked up a copy of variety the other day and heres this 
double page spread promoting rain man for oscar nominations 
hirsch said proudly thumbing through the entertainment publication 
then i came to this ad for midnight run then another for the 
film things change 
significant shooting on the three movies was carried out in 
nevada last year the three films helped boost nevada film industry 
revenues to 50 million in 1988 10 times the annual revenue 
generated before former gov richard bryan appointed hirsch to head 
the new motion picture division in july 1983 
thats real income dollars spent in the state by the industry 
with no multipliers applied hirsch said 
hirsch recently issued a glowing report reflecting nevadas 
growing role in the film industry a number of top boxoffice stars 
are headed for the state promising an even bigger year in 1989 
twentytwo feature films 25 television andor movie projects and 
five documentaries used nevada locations for filming during 1988 
commercial production increased 400 percent over 1987 nearly half 
of the 52 projects used southern nevada locales 
the years film highlights included rain man with dustin 
hoffman midnight run which starred robert deniro and charles 
grodin clint eastwoods pink cadillac far from home 
bonanza the next generation homer and eddie and once 
upon a texas train 
other tv films shot in nevada included high mountain rangers 
elvis and me and the former hit nbc series crime story 
other theatrical features included rambo iii and china lake 
several factors are making nevada an increasingly attractive 
location for filming 
one of the keys is the level of cooperation you get from our 
resorts hirsch said the contribution of the resort industry is 
significant even if the hotel isnt used in the film and the 
studio is just looking for a place to stay the hotel costs in 
nevada are half what they would cost in texas or colorado 
the motion picture industry is first and foremost a business 
if we can save a company money on such things as hotel rooms it 
gives us an edge 
another factor according to hirsch is the lack of bureaucracy 
in nevada because it is a small state we can get an answer for a 
film company in a matter of hours he said an example was 
midnight run hirsch negotiated with authorities to close a 
section of busy interstate 15 southwest of las vegas to film a 
roadblock segment for the movie 
onethird of midnight run was filmed in nevada a significant 
portion of rain man was also filmed in the state much of it 
during a monthlong stint at caesars palace in las vegas last summer 
the movie features the glitz and pizzazz of the las vegas strip 
and the worldfamous resort but it also captured on film some less 
famous southern nevada locales the tiny town of blue diamond 
southwest of the city got a new laundromat front for one scene a 
diner in tiny pahrump 50 miles west of las vegas was refurbished 
for another scene 
the diverse locales offered in nevada is a major selling point 
hirsch hammers home to movie production companies from the glamour 
and excitement of las vegas to nearby desert landscapes and the 
scenic sierra nevada in the northern part of the state 
this is an exciting place to be and it has a vast appeal to the 
hollywood mentality hirsch said of the las vegas area desert 
is desert whether its outside of las vegas in arizona or the high 
desert of colorado but most people would rather spend their 
offtime in las vegas if they had their choice 
several major films are scheduled for shooting in nevada in the 
upcoming months 
tom selleck will be shooting hard rain a movie for the 
disney co that also features ben kingsley 
steven spielberg will be shooting his new movie paradox 
with michael j fox a film that hirsch described as back to the 
future part ii 
a new mike hammer tv movie will be filming in las vegas in 
february 
a television pilot winner take all featuring abe bigoda 
as a hotel security guard is in production 
a motion picture kill me again is scheduled to begin 
production in the las vegas and reno areas in march 
two films destiny turns on the radio and beneath 
perfection are scheduled to spend 18 weeks filming in nevada

though mainstream radio has so far chosen to 
resist the songs of they might be giants the biting lyrics and 
unique music of guitarist john flansburgh and accordion player john 
linnell have helped the twoman band build a substantial following 
our songs are question marks linnell said we leave a lot 
more stuff hanging out than other bands 
the music is simple catchy and deceptively cheerful shoehorn 
with teeth could almost be mistaken for a toothpaste commercial if 
it werent for the lyrics he wants a shoehorn the one with 
teeth people should get beat up for stating their beliefs 
and kiss me son of god would fit right into a glee club 
recital if someone could find a way around these words now i 
laugh and make a fortune off the same ones that i tortured and the 
world screams kiss me son of god 
i think whats weird about our songs is that they work much 
more on a synmbolic level than on a literal level flansburgh 
said im not trying to make it more poetic than it really is 
were not too concerned about being really explicit i think its 
better for a person listening 
linnell and flansburgh grew up in the suburbs of boston and 
became friends in high school 
we hung out with a clique of people who were likeminded 
linnell said we were on the staff of the school newspapaer the 
high school had a newspaper office so we could hang out in the 
office and we didnt have to hang out in the hallway 
linnell was the first to show interest in music playing in high 
school bands but flansburgh would eventually catch the bug 
i did sort of tape stuff at my own home and started getting 
into the punk rock thing flansburgh saidthen a friend of mine 
gave me a guitar and said play this and youll never be the 
same 
a friend was also the source of linnells accordion 
id been a keyboard player in other bands but someone gave me 
this accordion and john and i started messing around with that 
linnell said i immediately took to it i think it has the biggest 
effect on us on stage we both have instruments where we can stand 
up and move around 
after graduating from high school they went their separate ways 
but reunited in 1981 when both moved to new york and ended up in the 
same apartment building before long they were working on songs and 
did some home recordings 
but the two johns as theyre sometimes called decided to start 
performing and the response was encouraging enough for them to seek 
a recording contract 
we were considerably farther off stream when we first 
started linnell said we had done a lot of tapes that werent 
strictly music typical sort of high school experimentation its 
kind of still with us in a way 
they still didnt know what to call the group after trying out 
different names the two johns were saved by yet another friend 
he was a ventriloquist flansburgh recalled he had a list 
of names for his own performance and one of them was they might be 
giants we just decided to rip his name off 
their selftitled debut album came out at the end of 1986 to 
nearly unanimous critical acclaim and respectable sales of 100000 
copies 
it was incredibly informal linnell said all we were doing 
was taking tapes we had made and remixing them 
both the first album and lincoln their latest lp were 
released by barnone records an independent label based in hoboken 
nj lincoln consists of 18 short songs whose titles include 
purple toupee and snowball in hell 
i dont think were particulary good at writing 10minute free 
improvisational songs flansburgh said what we do is really a 
normal art form its two minutes long and its got to be catchy 
somehow once youre secure writing in that medium it seems sort of 
unlimited 
even if they might be giants has failed to rule the air waves 
the two johns are certainly kings of the telephone lines 
when flansburgh and linnell were living together in brooklyn 
flansburgh came up with the idea of dialasong by phoning 
17183876962 one can reach an answering machine that plays the 
latest they might be giants song there is no additional cost for 
the caller nor does the duo collect a profit 
it was a way for people to get our songs without having to leave 
their house said flansburgh who estimates that dialasong 
receives 100 calls a day 
we didnt want people to go into this incredibly crowded room 
with all the smoke i never went to nightclubs because were not the 
most nightlifeoriented people we could just relate to people who 
worked during the day

a decade after their avantgarde exhibition in a 
beijing park shook up the moribund chinese art world a group of 
pioneering artists has reunited in this british colony for their 
first retrospective 
the youthful chinese artists known as the stars shot to 
prominence in 1979 when they marched through beijing to protest 
police interference in a show they had set up without official 
approval 
the authorities gave in and allowed the artists to stage the 
exhibition unprecedented in communist china that featured 
onceforbidden topics such as nudes abstracts and works of 
aesthetic rather than political content 
after another show in 1980 however the 30member group 
disbanded while some remained active in beijing others scattered 
around the globe settling in europe japan and the united states 
six of the artists were recently in hong kong for a retrospective 
featuring the work of 12 group members the exhibition opened 
earlier this month in the basement gallery of a posh residential 
neighborhood and is scheduled to run for five weeks before moving to 
taipei taiwan and paris 
sculptor wang keping said the stars were significant by showing 
that artistic activity in china need not be organized or approved by 
the ruling party earlier art was all the same he said 
individuality was the driving force behind the group agrees 
chang tsongzung the owner of hanart gallery who organized the 
retrospective the only common aim of the artists when they first 
started was that they wanted to be different from each other 
bo yun a teacher at the academy of arts and design in beijing 
whose abstract scroll paintings are part of the retrospective said 
artistic freedom in china has advanced since the groups landmark 
1979 exhibition but limitations remain 
there is no problem he said if you use a work of art to 
satirize an opponent of the government but if you mock the 
government im afraid that will pose a problem 
members of the stars also say beijing no longer allows them to 
exhibit as a group thwarting two attempts in 1983 and 1986 the 
reason believes bo is that the groups name has become a symbol of 
the democracy movement 
the retrospective includes works that date from the groups 
heyday including wangs buddhalike bust of chairman mao tsetung 
signifying the deification of the communist leader during the 
ultraleftist 196676 cultural revolution it is called the idol 
other pieces adopt obviously current themes including the 
mixedmedia work safe sex by ai weiwei that features a 
prophylactic attached to a rain coat prices run from hundreds to 
thousands of dollars 
the works are as different as the paths the artists have taken 
since they disbanded after their beijing exhibitions 
wang 39 a softspoken man with a wisp of a goatee who joined 
the fanatical red guard during the cultural revolution moved to 
paris in 1984 convinced he could not develop further in china 
largely because of political pressure art freedom is only 
possible in a democratic country with human rights he said 
the sculptor lives and works out of a workshop he rents from the 
french government and has been featured at the museum of 
contemporary art in paris and the olympic sculpture park in seoul 
south korea 
wang recently wrote a political play titled the retrial of wei 
jingsheng a contemporary of the stars who led a fledgling 
prodemocracy movement in china before being jailed for 15 years in 
1979 wang said the play will be performed in paris this march 
bo 40 has remained in beijing although he is considering a move 
overseas he supplements his 150 yuan 40 a month salary by 
selling his paintings to foreigners in china and at overseas 
exhibits he owns a tiny fiat a sign of financial wellbeing in a 
country where private cars remain rare 
other stars on display in the retrospective include huang rui and 
ma desheng the two leaders of the group and li shuang who was 
arrested in 1981 and sentenced to two years of labor reeducation 
for incitement to debauchery when she was arrested she was 
living with a french diplomat but had not yet married him 
the exhibition includes caligraphy by zhong ahcheng also known 
as ah cheng whose fictional work the king of children was 
translated to film and premiered at the cannes film festival last 
year 
although the stars have spread throughout the world they have 
stayed in touch with one another from the heady days of 197980 was 
forged a feeling of brotherhood that has not diminished bo said

almatariya egypt ap ancient heliopolis where legend says 
the phoenix was resurrected from its own ashes is buried or in 
ruins but like the fabulous bird that brought it fame the city 
itself is emerging from the ashes of time 
egyptian archaeologists are discovering remains under farmlands 
in the shadow of apartment highrises down alleyways and in 
midcampus at ein shams university 
so much is left but theres so much trouble getting to it 
said mohammed abdelgalil chief antiquities inspector for 
almatariya a crowded suburb six miles north of downtown cairo he 
is heading the search for ancient heliopolis struggling to keep a 
step ahead of a critical need for space to accommodate an exploding 
population 
the isolated temple columns mudbrick houses fallen obelisk 
decorated tombs with starstudded ceilings and pieces of mummies 
hint of the glory of the lost spiritual center the greeks named 
heliopolis city of the sun it honored the sun god re whose 
temple complex dominated ancient egypts history 
an elegant reminder of heliopolis past an obelisk stands in 
new yorks central park its twin the misnamed cleopatras 
needle graces the bank of the thames river in london 
the most impressive heliopolis remnant in its original home is a 
solitary obelisk of red aswan granite erected almost 4000 years 
ago by pharaoh senwosret i it weighs 121 tons and towers more than 
67 feet above a quiet park amid the daily hubbub of modern life 
gamal fares abufares a young antiquities inspector plucked a 
blue faience statuette from a desecrated brick tomb more than 2000 
years old 
grave robbers took the valuable things and tossed relics like 
this one aside he said the whole area is one vast cemetery 
nearby an angrylooking man paced back and forth the owner of 
the construction site where the tomb was discovered 
every time we find another relic he shakes his head 
abufares said explaining that it means the owner can do no work 
until the excavators finish 
by law construction cannot begin in egypt without a permit from 
the egyptian antiquities organization certifying the sites 
historical unimportance 
in almatariya where the probability is high of archaeological 
significance abufares spends part of each day riding through new 
housing areas checking building permits his reception can be far 
from friendly 
sometimes we get into fistfights he said 
historians fear for the city whose intellect dazzled early 
mediterraneans it gave the world the obelisk its mathematicians 
and astronomers created a solar calendar 365 days divided into 12 
months 
ancient heliopolis high priests created a think tank that 
beckoned the leading brains of the day the lawgiver solon came as 
did the mathematician pythagoras plato spent years absorbing 
heliopolis storehouse of knowledge 
the sprawling modern suburb that cairenes know as heliopolis lies 
southeast of the ancient city which covered what is now almatariya 
and nearby areas 
for almost 3000 years of pharaohs heliopolis stood undaunted 
bowing only to a brash young macedonian alexander the great who in 
331 bc founded a rival city 130 miles to the north alexandria 
by the time christianity took hold more than 400 years later 
heliopolis called on in the old testament was a ghost town 
its remains were slowly covered by sand or they were carted away to 
build the medieval city of cairo 
in legend ancient heliopolis lives sidebyside with the 
phoenix that dying magical bird set fire to itself on the altar in 
the great temple of re and a new phoenix would fly from the ashes 
to heaven a promise to the ancients of resurrection 
but two years ago the city became far more than legend to 
construction workers digging the foundation for an engineering 
school at ein shams university named for the spring where ancient 
egyptians believed the sun took its daily baths morning and night 
as they dug they unearthed evidence of a tomb the first of an 
eventual 15 that archaeologists would find 
on a recent day at the dig a tin can sat on the ground holding 
hundreds of colorful mummy beads that once adorned the dead skulls 
pieces of mummies hacked by grave robbers searching for jewelry and 
layers of mummy wrappings were clearly evident in the 
crosssectioned hillside frozen in time 
to the din of nearby construction excavators gingerly removed 
remains with picks and shovels 
a mile away inspectors are excavating a large cemetery with 
tombs decorated for officials 2500 years ago sarcophagi line 
uneven ground where a highrise had been planned 
almatariyas abdelgalil a softspoken man constantly tours 
such excavation sites trying to piece together the meaning of 
relics saved from steam shovel and pile driver his work takes him 
bumping from one rocky road to another from modern suburb to remote 
village a 10minute trip through a time tunnel 
he said the most important find so far is a milelong double 
mudbrick wall separating a suburb from farming fields according to 
surviving accounts of early travelers to ancient heliopolis the 
wall stretched for more than three miles surrounding an enormous 
city 
in a quiet village about a mile from the wall abdelgalil walked 
among columns heralding the exploits of pharaohs ramses iii and 
ramses iv 
we think a large temple of ramses iii is near here maybe under 
the fields abdelgalil said we have to find out but we have 
problems the villagers dont have a sense of history

robin williams traverses the country ridiculing 
republicans ronald reagan is the worlds largest muppet dan 
quayle is the stepford candidate george bush is a political 
hypnotist tousand points of light watch de watch 
people laugh they reward williams with ovations and they elect 
bush 
i dont know i cant understand it williams said in a 
recent interview bush still got elected it was like what 
wait a minute why i kept doing joke after joke firing quayle is 
too easy i mean its like shooting bullets into a dead horse 
he intends to keep on firing at such targets as the supreme 
court some of what you see is trying to write the constitution on 
an etchasketch and the imperial presidency there is an effort 
to turn congress into this kind of benign boys club they pass a 
law and its like what laws we dont need no stinkin 
laws 
the jokes keep coming but there is an underlying seriousness to 
robin williams wacky world one measure is the political material 
that has been incorporated in his act in recent years another is 
the charity benefits in which he participates 
this march he will appear on the thirdannual hbo comic 
relief to raise money for the homeless on feb 6 he will appear 
at a new york benefit to raise money for housing and for medical 
vans to treat homeless children a project sponsored by singer paul 
simon tables for the show at the sheraton centre sell from 10000 
to 25000 that kind of ticket puts a lot of pressure on a 
performer 
you know the chickens not what theyre paying for he said 
williams 38 is coming off his biggest screen success good 
morning vietnam in which he portrayed an irreverent saigon 
deejay hes just completed work on a new film the dead poets 
society about a teacher at a private boys school in the 1950s 
but it was williams artistry as a standup comic that launched 
his career and made him an enormous success 
hes much in demand on the benefit circuit his main charities 
involve aids and the homeless and he finds himself turning down 
worthy causes 
the problem is you dont want to end up being like someone who 
would go to the opening of an envelope he said 
you diminish your power you also diminish your ability to help 
the cause if you start doing every cause then people go oh its 
him there was a time when i did do every benefit save the 
shrimp hes there people people listen cocktail sauce is a 
horrible fate people 
he tries to find out as much as he can about his causes and 
candidates you better know about it or youll get creamed 
theyll start asking do you know his stand on the basic budget 
deficit 
in a childs voice no hes a nice guy though drives a good 
car 
he picks his causes from gut feeling and experience he has 
watched as acquired immune deficiency syndrome struck his friends a 
generation of performing artists it was everybody 
choreographers designers everything gone he said 
he is proud of a saturday night live bit he did on condoms 
i was trying to reach people other than people who know about 
them trying to reach 14 year olds its a balloon i know its 
difficult blowing sound use it inflate it put it on its a 
bathing cap of love dont be afraid uh well ill lose my 
sensitivity yeah youre real sensitive slap wake up wise up 
sparkie 
homelessness too is an issue he has observed personally most 
recently while in new york to perform in lincoln centers 
production of waiting for godot he was stopped by panhandlers 
each night on the way to the theater 
new york looks like bombay he said people are stepping 
over other people two people froze to death last night you go to 
grand central station and people are stacked like cord wood people 
are stepping over them and theres mayor edward koch kind of 
like mayor elmer fudd saying i feel like de pwabwem will go 
away uhhhhhh 
he is shaken by the city shelters for me the most horrifying 
thing is that there are children you cant not be moved when you 
see a child in these shelters when theyre living in these big 
open dorms he said 
children play an important role in williams thinking he traces 
his involvement in causes to the birth of his son zachary nearly 
six years ago fatherhood he says connects you immediately with 
everything 
i want the world to be at least slightly better for him to 
make it a little bit better so that he will not have to live 
underground with a twoheaded dog williams said 
he uses comedy he said to lash out to cut through things 
to cut through the illusion of things that everything is all 
right 
this is not always well received some audiences balk at 
political humor and theyll look like a deer in the headlights of 
a peterbilt a tractortrailer 
williams says there are few things that do not lend themselves to 
comedy 
part of being a comic is that youre forced to laugh at 
everything he says it makes it difficult to live with one 
there is dark humor too and everybody has that dark humor even 
about the darkest and bleakest things 
he tries to avoid cruelty a line he admits to having crossed 
more than once he describes a bad comicgood comic battle 
within 
thats cruel thats unnecessarily cruel the good comic says 
yeah but its funny yeah its cruel but its real funny 
says the bad comic 
its cruel 
yeah but ya gotta laugh go with it dont be afraid 
no no no 
oh shut up 
then says robin williams the middle mind says yeah its 
funny

when jerri kiesler used to get upset lonely or 
bored shed pull out her dozen credit cards and zoom to the 
shopping malls in search of some little bauble to raise her spirits 
i liked to go to specialty stores where they would call me by 
my name as i walked through the door said the 50yearold dayton 
ohio grandmother it gave me a feeling of self worth 
her mood changed as the bills arrived followed by late notices 
dunning letters and curt telephone calls from creditors in two 
years mrs kiesler amassed 12000 in creditcard debt nearly half 
her annual income from an accounting job there was no way she could 
pay all the bills 
she now jokes that at least her trip to bankruptcy court was made 
in style thanks to the dresses and more than 200 pairs of shoes 
shed charged from 1984 to 1986 
mrs kiesler who filed for personal bankruptcy three years ago 
and has remained clean since is one of many american 
creditcard holders facing crippling financial problems from the 
enormous power of plastic 
the national foundation for consumer credit says about 2 percent 
of the 130 million americans who buy on credit are mired in 
creditcard debt 4 percent face some difficulties and 10 
percent experience some discomfort 
some troubled cardholders might take cash advances from one card 
to pay debt from another the foundation says others dip into 
savings or borrow from friends and neighbors 
credit problems grow more acute this time of year because the 
christmas bills start rolling in the american bankers association 
says holiday credit card use rose between 8 percent and 9 percent in 
1988 over the previous year 
debt counselors and therapists say theyve noticed a steady 
increase in the number of people with credit problems seeking help 
and requests for assistance have intensified this month 
many claim thats partly because banks and credit card companies 
have lowered their standards by giving people far more credit than 
they can handle 
luther gatling who runs the nonprofit budget amp credit 
counseling services inc in new york said that while calls for help 
from debtswamped clients might be more noticeable after the 
holidays this business doesnt really have an ebb or flow 
it used to be that we got real busy the end of january but 
because of the proliferation of credit you dont see it as 
acutely he said christmas does heap on credit and this 
may push some people over the edge 
to help creditcard addicts the marylandbased national 
foundation for consumer credit an umbrella group for services like 
gatlings has nearly doubled its nationwide offices to around 400 
in the last two years said foundation president donald l badders 
he said the number of individuals and families receiving budget 
counseling from them soared to 211000 for the year ended oct 1 
from 176700 in 1987 and 118000 five years ago 
as baby boomers came of age in the past 10 years the 
consuming public has grown badders said the complexity of 
consumer economics has grown 
so has the spendthrift yuppie mentality to some degree 
weve gotten to be a much more materialistic society the cost 
of looking successful is going up and up said evan steffans a 
therapist at miami valley hospital in dayton ohio who cofounded a 
shopper stoppers counseling program with mrs kiesler three years 
ago 
badders said the percentage of debtdogged consumers has remained 
fairly constant but the size of their debt is a lot deeper than it 
was 10 years ago 
for example the average person counseled at the foundation 
offices in 1980 had around 9000 in accummulated debt compared 
with 15000 in 1987 and 17000 last year badders said credit card 
debt is the fastest growing component of overall consumer debt 
this tells us that the percentage of those getting into trouble 
have taken advantage of more credit opportunities he said what 
ive seen happen is more aggressive marketing on the part of credit 
card companies 
that marketing some credit counselors contend can be 
irresponsible the counselors complain that banks in particular 
dont adequately supervise different subsidiaries that peddle cards 
mrs kiesler and many others who have faced even worse credit 
problems claim they sometimes have received card applications from 
the same banks harassing them to pay delinquent bills 
it became a challenge to get credit cards i still get 
applications said mrs kiesler now unemployed 
joseph l boutin an executive vice president for howard bank in 
burlington vt and an aba executive vice president said those 
cases are rare he said most banks thoroughly check credit 
backgrounds 
im sure youre going to be able to find some banks that have 
lowered their standards for whatever reasons boutin said most 
banks recognize when they make a loan they have to be paid back 
because we have deposit funds at risk 
still more people who are normally considered a greater credit 
risk young adults teens and modestincome earners hold a 
significant portion of the approximately 850 million credit cards in 
circulation 
robert johnson director of purdue universitys credit research 
center said his most recent data show 21 percent of families with 
annual income of less than 10000 were card holders in 1986 vs 12 
percent in 1983 he said 42 percent of those under age 25 had credit 
cards in 1986 vs 20 percent in 1983 many bankers and merchants 
agree that solicitations for new credit card customers have 
increased but they attribute it to wider acceptance of credit cards 
and growing competition for customers 
this rivalry has pressured issuers to reduce annual fees or lower 
interest rates at a time when interest rates have been rising 
further squeezing profits are taxlaw changes reducing the 
deductibility of creditcard interest the aba says about a third of 
all card users used to pay their entire bills at the end of the 
month but in the last year that rose to 40 percent many issuers 
had derived much of their earnings from interest payments on 
balances left outstanding

skinheads have grabbed headlines recently for 
their whitepower and nazi leanings but in fact not all skinheads 
share those views and they often battle among themselves the 
skinhead culture is intense complex and tribal often built more on 
friendship and unity than on ideology here is a look at the 
phemonenon particularly what happened among a group of skinheads in 
milwaukee 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
in the early days the whole crew was cool hippy 
pat and big brian lived at the house little bryan john and his 
brother tiny were around so were jeff the black skinhead mike the 
jew and a whole lot of other guys 
nobody gave you bad slack there wasnt much politics and there 
was plenty of beer sure you might go out on manhunts or 
fagbashing but you werent after anyone in particular mostly it 
was a place to hang out a place to be with your skinhead brothers 
a place you felt you belonged 
they called the house at 700 wright the 700 club as a joke they 
called themselves sham skinheads around milwaukee 
then things got weird and then it got scary 
today sham is the skinhead army of milwaukee depleted by 
defections and arrests its numbers are down to a hardcore few who 
praise hitler preach white power and recruit for the cause 
they are opposed by the brew city skins antiracist skinheads 
who include old sham members there have been fights between the two 
groups of former friends and the violence is likely to continue 
its real sad what happened said john lyman a thoughtful 
21yearold skinhead who has tried to maintain a neutrality between 
the warring factions we were all brothers that was important to 
us then it went every which way and now everybody totally hates 
each other 
the story of sham is a mirror to what is happening around the 
country disaffected teenagers attracted to the skinhead culture 
by its music its sense of belonging and its urban warrior image 
are waging tribal wars on the hard streets of the nations cities 
some become avowed racists and fascists who sport swastika 
tattoos sometimes they set upon the targets of their rage 
others choose a militantly antiracist stance battling not only 
the racists but also those who try to remain apolitical 
there is definitely a war going on within a subculture of 
society and 99 percent of us arent aware that its happening except 
for those moments when it spills out and a jew or a black is 
assaulted said chip berlet of political research associates a 
cambridge mass thinktank that studies right wing movements 
most public attention has focused on the talk show and crime news 
sensationalism of racist skinheads whose numbers are thought to be 
around 3500 
assaults on minorities and synagogue vandalism by these skinheads 
have made headlines in big cities like chicago and dallas and 
smaller communities like grand rapids reno and paramus nj three 
skinheads have been charged with beating an ethiopian immigrant to 
death with baseball bats in portland ore skinheads have thrown 
racial slurs and chairs during national talk show appearances 
i want a white world said scott a 21yearold skinhead in 
chicago i dont want my kids to go to school with niggers and 
jews ill die for my race ill die for my skinhead brothers 
there has been less news media coverage of antiracist skinheads 
who have been in bloody brawls with their rivals in places like 
chicago and minneapolis no one has counted their numbers but in 
many cities they are equal if not stronger in number than the racist 
skinheads 
last weekend skinheads from eight midwestern cities held a summit 
in minneapolis to form a syndicate to organize and fight the 
racist skins 
this is a war said dave a member of the minneapolis 
baldies were not going to stop till weve wiped out the scum 
both factions pay homage to the british sociological stew of the 
1960s and early 70s that produced the skinhead phenomenon from the 
ranks of working class youths they shaved their heads and adopted a 
style of dress from the factories that included highlaced 
steeltipped doc marten work boots suspenders called braces on 
both sides of the atlantic and fred perry knit shirts 
at some point the movement shifted many skinheads victims of 
britains high unemployment began to blame and attack pakistanis 
and other immigrants skinheads were recruited by the national 
front britains ultra right wing political movement ska a 
racially mixed music once favored by skinheads was replaced by the 
hardcore rock of skrewdriver a band whose music is a call to arms 
for white supremacists 
one song complains 
they come here to this country from the jungles and the trees 
traitors in the parliament gave them a better deal 
before the night falls heed the white call 
basic skinhead philosophy rejects drugs and encourages a pride in 
yourself and your country skinheads also stress a family unity 
among themselves an enticement to many alienated youths whose real 
families have been fractured 
a lot of them are damaged goods said larry harding a 
portland probation officer they come from broken homes they 
dont fit in in school and they are sometimes attacked by ethnic 
gangs being a skinhead offers them a chance to be part of 
something 
while some american skinheads like scott were first attracted by 
the white power message many others like those at milwaukees 700 
club join the scene for its style and unity 
it was more out of a strong sense of friendship a sense of 
security said tom dusick another neutral skin who was at the 
700 club when it began in late 1987 when you went down there you 
were important and no one was going to mess with you skinheads 
the scene in the early days of sham was open and relaxed jeff 
merchant a black skinhead from chicago was an accepted member of 
the crew 
but the crew members werent angels they would get beery and go 
out on manhunts roaming nearby downer avenue in search of 
trouble 
its not like we really were looking for it but 10 bald guys 
walking down the street somebodys got to say something said 
merchant now a leader of the brew city skins 
but even in the early days there was a latent racism the crew at 
the 700 club would joke about jews and blacks even today some of 
lymans friends talk about the niggers who do all the crime and 
the jews who own all the corporations

a lot of us are from places where there are no black people or 
jewish people so a lot of the guys just had these stereotype ideas 
and it just took something to bring them out said lyman 
most agree things began to change with the appearance of pat 
omalley an intense gravelvoiced 18yearold from madison with a 
spiderweb tattoo on his shaved skull and a swastika tatt on his 
finger 
omalley got a post office box and began corresponding with 
racist skinhead groups in chicago and detroit and with white aryan 
resistance a fallbrook calif group run by tom metzger host of 
the white power race and reason cable television show 
the material sent to sham was filled with jarring words and 
images nigger and kike appeared often along with talk about 
revolution and race warfare much of it was in the form of 
fanzines newsletters published by racist skinhead groups in 
america and europe 
the skinhead phenomena has its own motor and own leadership and 
then you have metzger who is trying to inject ideology discipline 
and a level of expertise said leonard zeskind research director 
for the antiracist center for democratic renewal 
metzger says he is doing nothing more than responding to the 
anger and frustration of young whites 
they see they are slipping through the cracks economically and 
they dont feel they have much of a future he said i give them 
guidence on the law to stay out of trouble and i give them our 
ideology but i dont try to organize them they have their own 
subculture and tampering with it would destroy it 
whatever the reason the scene at the 700 club slowly changed 
someone drew a crosshairs on the television set and labeled it 
the niggerscope when a black appeared on the screen there would 
be cheers of we got another one 
merchant retaliated by changing the label to naziscope and 
altering the white power scrawls on the wall to white coward 
nobody threatend merchant after all he was a brother skinhead 
but after awhile he stopped coming around 
they started handing out hate literature and stuff and people 
told me hey just dont go over there so i didnt he said 
the black college student wasnt alone bryan lauer little 
bryan dropped out too turning his back on a childhood friend who 
had become more and more racist 
i cant talk to him anymore said lauer 
but sham continued to grow word went out on the post office box 
grapevine that milwaukee had a cool scene racist skins from 
detroit chicago and texas showed up and moved in 
now the scene got scary 
i remember this one guy who had been in virginia and detroit 
and cleveland saying how he was going to die to see this country all 
white said dusick they were talking about how they were going 
to exterminate everybody 
he concluded these guys are wacky and he didnt go back 
sham moved from the wrecked house on wright street to another 
address members attended klan and nazi rallies in other cities and 
attracted local media coverage by goosestepping and then brawling 
at a neighborhood fair 
a newspaper printed a map of the skinhead house and carloads of 
teenagers began to drive by tossing bottles and shouting threats 
last july 14 hollin lange a member of the dallas hammerskins 
was hit by birdshot while standing outside the house six days later 
he and omalley fired into a car of teens claiming they had seen a 
gun 
the shooting ended sham as in other cities like chicago and los 
angeles the violence and subsequent arrests broke up the group 
sending some members fleeing to oregon texas and oklahoma 
these days the five or so remaining members of sham keep a low 
profile at their new house the street buzz is they are recruiting 
younger kids in nearby towns like racine and kenosha they refuse to 
talk to the press as does omalley who is scheduled to go on trial 
this week 
lauer and the brew city skins are also recruiting passing out 
literature to explain the differences between them and sham 
we want people to know were different said lauer 
neutrals like lyman and dusick are facing growing pressure to 
choose between the two sides 
its getting real hard to stay out of it said lyman 
if forced to choose lyman says he will have to back his friends 
in sham he doesnt believe in their hatred but he goes back with 
them to the days when it was just a bunch of people with shaved 
heads and a kinship 
its a real deep friendship thing it made me feel like i was 
somebody for once he said even if they are the worst to 
everybody they were still our brothers

budget amp credit counseling services inc just 
north of the wall street financial district seems almost cheery 
with smiling receptionists bright lights and pretty pastelcolored 
cubicles 
but once inside debtplagued clients are asked to spill their 
financial guts detailing everything from mortgage payments to the 
monthly cost of cleaning their underwear 
a recent visit showed its seldom pleasant 
mary a 58yearold brooklyn woman sat tearful as counselor ann 
quigley tried to concoct a repayment plan for the 12056 in credit 
card debts she racked up over two years mary said she made the 
charges mostly for cash advances to help pay her 19yearold 
grandsons college costs 
i really dont know how i spend it because i dont make it 
said the woman who earned 17352 last year in her social services 
job 10 percent of which was donated to her church 
have they creditors been calling you a lot asked ms 
quigley 
no just sending letters mostly mary replied i knew after 
the start of the year that they would start bugging me though 
tell me how much is your monthly rent transportation costs 
laundry or drycleaning bill ms quigley asked 
she discovered that all of marys 926 monthly pay is spent on 
necessities that left nothing for savings not to mention the 455 
a month ms quigley had proposed as a payback to creditors under a 
threeyear plan 
would you consider getting a parttime job she asked 
meanwhile several feet away mark a 30yearold word processor 
operator sat with a phone in his ear he had discarded his 10000 
worth of creditcard bills two years ago and was trying to 
reestablish contact with creditors 
who invented these credit cards anyway he huffed 
the new york budget counseling office which sees about 10000 
families and individuals a year is one of about 400 offices 
nationwide affiliated with the nonprofit marylandbased national 
foundation for consumer credit its also one of the busiest 
foundation president donald l badders says the number of people 
seeking credit help has risen steadily for reasons ranging from 
family economic problems to wider credit card use 
in the fiscal year ended oct 1 the foundation offices counseled 
211000 clients 78 percent higher than five years ago last year 
the foundation said it recovered 242 million to businesses through 
the repayment plans it arranged with clients 
for a 20 fee sometimes waived for extreme cases these offices 
act as an intermediary between debtors and creditors arranging for 
small monthly repayments 
there are also forprofit budget counseling offices but the 
foundation says some are flybynight operations that charge big 
fees and make false promises 
watch out for credit clinics that purport to be able to repair 
your credit rating because it cannot be done said luther gatling 
founder and president of the new york budget counseling office 
debtors have several options to reform 
besides following the foundations standard threeyear plan they 
can take out a debtconsolidation loan but some experts warn these 
loans are disguised homeequity loans saddling a debtor with the 
risk of losing his home if he fails to repay 
another alternative is personal bankruptcy debtors can either 
repay loans after liquidating assets under chapter 7 of federal 
bankruptcy laws or reorganize and stave off creditors under chapter 
13 either way their credit rating will remain tarnished for at 
least seven years

whittle communications lp plans to launch a daily 
televised news show that will include commercials and give schools 
thousands of dollars in equipment to show it in the classroom during 
the school day 
in its first venture into television the knoxville tennbased 
media company plans to begin testing its daily 12minute news show 
which includes up to two minutes of ads in early march in four to 
six schools 
if the sevenweek test proves successful the program could 
launched nationally in the fall of 1990 in up to 10000 schools with 
as many as 7 million students at a cost of more than 100 million in 
hardware alone 
christopher whittle chairman and founder of the company said 
the project represents what we hope will be our major contribution 
to the media business in the 1990s and possibly whittles most 
lucrative venture 
whittle believes the program has advantages for students 
educators and advertisers but the plan also has raised questions 
about allowing marketers to make sales pitches in the classroom 
peggy charren president of action for childrens television a 
selfstyled childrens advocate said it is outrageous to let 
sales people into the schools connected to education 
the schools will get dozens of television monitors a satellite 
dish and a system hooking it all together so that the news show 
dubbed channel one can be shown to students daily the schools can 
use the system for their own noncommercial purposes provided they 
run the show or explain why not 
whittle said the hardware alone will cost about 50000 per 
school a price many schools could not afford 
the show initially being produced in los angeles will be sent 
by satellite to the schools every weekday it is being produced by 
susan winston a former producer of abcs good morning america 
show 
a typical show which could have possibly four 30second 
commercials would have several hard news stories relevant to 
students in the 12to17 age group and narrated by young anchor 
people a profile of someone in the news a segment in a multipart 
series on an issue like the environment and other features 
interlaced with trivia or a quiz 
whittle said 60 percent of the ad time has been sold for the test 
but refused to identify the buyers he said if the program goes 
national sponsors will be asked for longterm commitments possibly 
up to five years 
he said many advertisers are interested in reaching the elusive 
teenage audience which has attracted even wider attention as teens 
have started shopping for the family because both parents work 
outside the home 
but the paid pitches have raised some concerns 
whittle has identifed only three of the schools selected for the 
test they are mumford high school in detroit eisenhower middle 
school in kansas city kan and central high school in knoxville 
tenn 
robin oden principal at mumford conceded he has reservations 
about airing commercials in school 
but he said the advantages of getting the video hardware and a 
timely program with educational value outweighed the negatives of 
the commercials 
the school could absolutely not afford to buy the 103 
television monitors and satellite dish it will get for the test 
project oden said 
he likes the idea of being able to use the system to address the 
entire school by television show videos of classroom lessons or run 
tapes recorded from television such as a special on martin luther 
king jr 
nonetheless oden said he told whittle communications he would 
not permit a show for example which had advertising that 
encouraged students to wear the type of clothing or jewelry to 
school that mumfords dress policy forbids 
whittle said his agreement with the schools allows administrators 
to review shows before they are aired and to withhold them if they 
find something objectionable provided they report their reasons for 
doing so 
he said he has banned ads for beer or other alcoholic beverages 
cigarettes and contraceptives 
whittle communications has found rewards in creating media aimed 
at reaching narrowlydefined audiences its revenue amounted to 150 
million last year and time inc paid 185 million for a 50 percent 
interest in the concern last october 
whittle currently reaches about 10000 students with sponsored 
posters and its go girls only magazine 
last summer it launched special reports magazine a series of 
six magazines available only in doctors waiting rooms that project 
generated 40 million a year in ad revenue

tons in october and 178 million tons in november 1987 for the

the 11 months foreign steel captured 206 percent of the market in 
1988 and 21 percent in 1987 
import quotas due to expire in september after five years in 
force were intended to restrict imported steel to 202 percent of 
the us market 
a rival to the us producers organization the new yorkbased 
american institute for imported steel in new york said that after 
subtracting semifinished steel ordered by us mills from foreign 
producers market penetration was only 177 percent below the 185 
percent goal for that category 
us steelmakers bought an estimated 284 million tons of foreign 
steel in the first 11 months of 1988 the aiis said

yugoslavs already frustrated by a 
sharp fall in living standards were hit thursday by a new wave of 
price increases on more than 300 goods and services including 
gasoline diesel fuel and other oil derivatives averaging 2858 
percent 
a liter 026 gallons of highoctane gasoline went up by 31 
percent and now costs 2260 dinars 41 cents the liter price of 
regular gasoline jumped from 1610 dinars 29 cents to 2120 dinars 
39 cents and diesel fuel rose from 1420 dinars 26 cents to 
1850 dinars 34 cents 
average yugoslav monthly wages amounts to the equivalent of about 
80 
the national petroleum company attributed the increase to a 3662 
percent depreciation of the dinar against the us dollar since the 
last fuel price hike on nov 12 which makes foreign oil purchases 
more expensive in the local currency 
yugoslavs were hit as of the start of this year by an 
unprecedented wave of price hikes for about 1000 goods and services 
ranging from 30 to 70 percent the increases applied to food 
drinks clothing cosmetics and nearly all services 
the hikes further boosted the countrys rampant inflation which 
recorded 251 percent for 1988 living standards have dropped by half 
since 1980 and have fallen to the level of mid1960s according to 
official statistics 
the statistics also say that nearly 70 percent of yugoslav 
workers live in a state of existential minimum 
a record of nearly 1400 strikes seriously threatening the

motorola inc has filed a lawsuit charging that 
hitachi ltd has infringed on several of the us companys patents 
and is engaging in unfair competition in the sale of microprocessors 
in the lawsuit filed wednesday in us district court motorola 
accuses tokyobased hitachi of engaging in unfair competition with 
its new h8 microprocessor 
also named in the lawsuit are hitachi america ltd of itasca 
ill and nissei sangyo america ltd of rolling meadows ill both 
distributors of hitachi products 
hitachi america is greatly surprised at this action by 
motorola spokesman sam nishikawa said until hitachi america 
has had an opportunity to review the complaint we are unable to 
comment on this matter 
a hearing was scheduled for today on motorolas request for an 
injunction halting sales of the microprocessor the lawsuit also 
asks for monetary damages to be determined by the court 
motorola based in schaumburg ill says the unfair competition 
began shortly after motorola granted a patent license to hitachi for 
certain motorola microprocessors in may 1986 
the company says the hitachi h8 microprocessor series infringes 
on at least four motorola patents 
the microprocessor is a digital electronic device that performs 
the control and arithmetic functions of a computer 
motorola says its patent license and related technology 
agreements with hitachi specifically limit the use of motorolas 
confidential and proprietary information on the mc680068000 
families of microprocessors 
despite the limits hitachi introduced its zero turnaround time 
microprocessors in 1986 using motorola technology that was excluded 
from agreements between the companies motorola said 
motorola spokesman tim kellogg said his company had been in 
negotiations with hitachi since october in an effort to stop sales 
of the h8 microprocessor 
we have had patent licenses with hitachi for more than 10 
years kellogg said this is the first time we have had to sue 
them 
in 1983 hitachi one of japans largest makers of computers 
electronic circuits and consumer electronic products agreed to pay 
international business machines corp between 2 million and 4 
million a month for eight years 
hitachi agreed to the payments to settle an ibm lawsuit that 
charged hitachi with using computer software that too closely 
resembled software copyrighted by ibm hitachi did not admit to any 
guilt in the agreement 
also in 1983 hitachi pleaded guilty to federal charges of 
attempting to obtain and transport stolen ibm computer materials to 
japan it paid the maximum fine of 10000 
the motorola lawsuit claims that hitachi used motorolas 
exclusive proprietary technology to coerce motorola into extending 
additional patent license rights to hitachi

churchs fried chicken fighting a 290 
million hostile takeover by its chief rival says it is for sale 
but still calls inadequate the buyout offer made by popeyes famous 
fried chicken and biscuits 
churchs which over the past three months has sold off 
restaurants and taken popeyes to court in an attempt to halt the 
hostile takeover bid announced wednesday that it would be in the 
companys best interest to be auctioned off 
in a prepared statement the companys board of directors said it 
could end the bidding for the companys sale within 30 days 
the statement also said that churchs financial advisers still 
believed popeyes offer of 8 per share was inadequate but that it 
was willing to provide popeyes the information that had been 
provided to other interested third parties 
we believe the offer by copeland is inadequate and to have them 
shareholders move on that is not in their best interest said 
churchs attorney diane kerr we think this decision is a move 
made out of responsibility by the directors for the shareholders 
popeyes is owned by al copeland who earlier this month was given 
permission to continue his attempted takeover of churchs after 
federal court proceedings stalled his efforts 
san antoniobased churchs the countrys no 2 chicken 
restaurant chain with 1478 units has been fighting since last 
november a hostile takeover bid by new orleansbased popeyes the 
countrys no 3 chicken chain with 703 restaurants 
churchs claims that two of its former executives now working for 
popeyes used illegally obtained information in the buyout offer and 
that the buyout would violate us antitrust laws 
on nov 4 churchs adopted antitakeover bylaws to make a 
takeover less attractive and later challenged popeyes in court 
churchs announcement wednesday came a day before a san antonio 
federal judge was to preside over a hearing to determine the 
legality of antitakeover bylaws 
churchs spokeswoman faye kilgore said that ernie renaud 
churchs president and chief executive officer would not be 
available for comment wednesday 
popeyes officials did not return telephone calls to the 
associated press 
us district judge charles schwartz of new orleans in late 
november prohibited popeyes from buying churchs stock until it 
revealed more information about its buyout offer 
churchs meanwhile sued by shareholders worried that their 
earnings would be jeopardized if the company was not sold announced 
in middecember that it would immediately close 120 of its 
restaurants around the country 
in january a 5th us circuit court of appeals panel said that 
popeyes could continue with its takeover bid 
under the tentative plan given to schwartz in december popeyes 
planned to close 250 of churchs restaurants rename 303 others as 
popeyes sell 440 others for 160 million and would keep 83 
restaurants with the churchs name

inflation on the consumer side reached 44 percent during 1988 
the same as a year earlier as hefty droughtinduced increases for 
groceries offset stable energy prices the government reported today 
the gain as measured in the labor departments consumer price 
index matched the 1987 increase which was the highest since 1981 
but was four times the 11 percent rate in 1986 a 25year low 
a 03 percent rise in the index in december which followed a 03 
percent november increase helped inflation finish the year at a 
moderate pace 
the summer drought which shriveled crops and seared pastures 
pushed food prices for the year up 52 percent the steepest rise 
since 1980 however energy for the year rose only a slight 05 
percent following an 82 percent jump in 1987 
in another economic report today the commerce department said 
housing construction fell 22 percent in december from the previous 
month that helped drag down construction for the entire year to 
149 million units the poorest showing for the housing industry 
since the recession year of 1982 when 106 million units were built 
decembers seasonally adjusted annual rate of 152 million units 
was down from 156 million units a month earlier it was the 
steepest monthly drop since a 121 percent decline last may 
on wednesday the commerce department reported that novembers 
trade imbalance reached 125 billion the biggest in five months 
and 22 percent larger than octobers 103 billion deficit 
but even with the november deterioration the trade deficit for 
the first 11 months of 1988 was running at an annual rate of 1373 
billion almost 20 percent below the alltime imbalance of 1703 
billion set in 1987 
many private economists viewed the latest report as an indication 
of the severity of the countrys trade problems 
undaunted by the disappointing trade figures though financial 
markets posted strong performances wednesday some analysts said 
market operators took comfort from renewed hopes that inflationary 
pressures may be abating 
the stock market rose in heavy trading with the dow jones 
average of 30 industrials up 2411 points at 223875 surpassing 
its postcrash peak of 222607 it reached last friday 
some of the power driving equities higher came from the 
surprising resilience of the dollar frequently in the past a poor 
trade report induced currency dealers to dump dollars but on 
wednesday heavy buying pushed the dollar higher against most leading 
currencies 
taking a cue from the currency markets bond prices rose with the 
benchmark 30year treasury bond gaining nearly 7 for each 1000 in 
face value 
in commodity markets crude oil futures continued their recent 
rally and pierced the important psychological level of 19 a barrel 
in other economic reports wednesday 
the federal reserve board said production at the nations 
factories mines and utilities climbed 03 percent in december 
following a revised increase of 04 percent in november 
the fed said the operating rate at factories mines and 
utilities rose in december to the highest rate since november 1979 
industrial capacity rose 01 percentage points to 842 percent last 
month the highest rate since 843 percent in november 1979 the 
operating rate for november 1988 was a revised 841 percent 
but even with the november deterioration the trade deficit for 
the first 11 months of 1988 was running at an annual rate of 1373 
billion almost 20 percent below the alltime imbalance of 1703 
billion set in 1987

antismoking activists have presented the 
government with an action plan for a smokefree norway by the year 
2000 
the plan handed to social minister tove strand gerhardsen this 
week was a followup to a law adopted last year forbidding smoking 
in areas like theater lobbies bus or train terminals and in 
offices occupied by more than one person 
the government itself has endorsed the goal of making norway 
smokeless by the end of the century though tobacco consumption in 
recent years has increased by 500 tons per year norway has 
prohibited tobacco advertising since 1973 
seven organizations including the norwegian association of 
sports federations the national public health assn and the 
norwegian cancer society formulated a tough program urging the 
government to adopt it in stages over the next six years 
among the measures were a smokefree environment in schools and 
kindergartens an increase in taxes on tobacco products and 
outlawing their sale to youths under 18 
the action plan demanded a smoking ban in prisons and other 
public institutions it called for setting aside for nonsmokers at 
least onethird of all hotel rooms and tables at hotel restaurants 
by 1992 and further reducing that by at least half by 1995 
all discoteques clubs theater restaurant and concert halls 
should be offlimits to smokers the plan said 
chewing tobacco and snuff which some scandinavians stick to 
their upper gum would be declared health hazards 
the plan called for a special working group including government 
representatives to monitor implementation of the action plan

shamrock holdings inc said today it has raised its 
tender offer for polaroid corp to 45 per share including 
approximately 10 million shares issued to polaroids employee stock 
ownership plan valuing the new deal at 32 billion 
stanley p gold shamrocks president and chief executive 
officer also said that shamrock would wage a proxy battle for 
control of polaroids board at the annual meeting may 9 
shamrock a burbank califbased television and radio concern 
wholly owned by the roy e disney family previously had offered 42 
a share not including the esop shares or 26 billion 
there was no immediate comment from polaroid the instant camera 
company based in cambridge 
polaroid management has rejected previous shamrock offers and 
more than 5000 of the companys 8300 employees signed a petition 
last month saying they had no comfort or confidence that a 
takeover would benefit the company 
he added that shamrocks slate of nominees would be committed to 
the sale of polaroid to shamrock unless a bonafide third party 
offer is made for all the then outstanding shares at a higher 
price 
shamrock said its tender offer expires march 15 and is contingent 
on obtaining at least 90 percent of polaroids 716 million 
outstanding stock including the shares in the employee stock 
ownership plan 
the takeover may hinge on a court battle over the legality of the 
esop which shamrock claims was enacted to forestall a takeover the 
delaware supreme court has scheduled oral arguments in march on 
shamrocks appeal of a chancery court ruling that upheld the esop 
shamrock said that if it wins the appeal it will raise its offer 
to 47 dollars a share

richard darman nominated to be george bushs 
budget director said today the presidentelect does not plan to 
weasel out of his pledge against raising taxes by calling a tax 
increase something else 
darman told his senate confirmation hearing he expects bush will 
abide by the duck test if it looks like a tax increase it is 
a tax increase 
bush meant no new taxes as it would ordinarily be understood 
by ordinary americans and the duck test should be applied if 
ordinary people think it is a tax increase it is a tax increase 
darman said 
he specifically included in bushs read my lips pledge 
against tax increases a boost in the gasoline tax higher levies on 
alcohol and tobacco removal of home mortgage interest deductions 
and taxation of currently exempt employee fringe benefits like 
health insurance 
concerned that darman was opening the door to tax increases by 
some written answers to advance questions several members of the 
senate governmental affairs committee questioned him about possible 
new taxes 
in his written responses darman had said that under some 
circumstances a boost in taxes on gasoline cigarettes and liquor 
could be viewed as user fees he had also suggested that higher 
taxes on social security benefits might be described as a benefit 
reduction 
but in those answers darman went on to say that what really 
matters is the old ifitlookslikeduck rule if it looks like 
a tax to most americans its a tax 
during the questioning today darman said that a serious economic 
calamity caused by the huge budget deficits might force him to 
recommend that bush violate his nonewtaxes pledge but he 
emphasized that he did not foresee such a recommendation in large 
part because it is important that a new president not lose his 
credibility by reneging on a campaign promise 
asked how many years bushs notax pledge was good for darman 
replied we might as well assume forever certainly for some 
extended period of time 
darman the point man in bushs battle to reduce the deficit was 
widely praised by committee members for his government skills and is 
expected to win confirmation easily as director of the office of 
management and budget 
in his opening statement darman said it is essential to reduce 
the deficit 
we must end the game of wonderland politics where cuts are 
increases and going down means going up darman said 
however darman said congress and the new administration must not 
lose sight of other problems facing the country 
unless the deficit is reduced in the right way the country runs 
the risk of economic travail he said 
we must keep america growing we must increase savings and 
investment increase productivity and renew our pioneering spirit 
darman said these are inescapable requirements if we are to keep 
america a strong and shining beacon of hope 
in his opening testimony darman made no mention of bushs 
flexible freeze approach to balancing the budget without tax 
increases but several members of the senate governmental affairs 
committee were expected to spend quite a bit of time grilling darman 
in a search for details on bushs plan 
darman the point man in bushs battle to reduce the deficit is 
in many ways similar to david stockman reagans first budget 
director both men have been described as brilliant political 
strategists but they have also been accused by critics of being 
abrasive and intellectually arrogant 
darmans role as head of the omb will put him more in the 
spotlight than he was during the reagan years when he served as one 
of the administrations top behindthescenes strategists first as 
a top white house aide and then as deputy treasury secretary in 
both posts he worked closely with james a baker iii nominated by 
bush to be secretary of state 
darman resigned from the no 2 job at treasury in april 1987 to 
take a job with the investment banking division of shearson lehman 
brothers he was lured back into politics last year when he joined 
the bush campaign serving as a standin for democratic candidate 
michael dukakis during bushs debate practice sessions a role 
stockman performed for ronald reagan in 1980 
during the presidential campaign bush repeatedly asserted that 
he favored a flexible freeze on spending with overall growth of 
the budget held to the rate of inflation with only social security 
and interest on the national debt exempt from possible spending cuts 
bush also proposed increased spending in a variety of areas such 
as education child care and the environment but he repeatedly 
refused to provide details on which government programs he would cut 
in order to lower the budget deficit 
president reagan submitted his final budget last week a 115 
trillion spending plan for the fiscal year which begins next oct 1 
bush has said he will address a joint session of congress soon after 
taking office and provide an outline of his own budget proposals 
bush is expected to address congress on feb 9 house budget 
committee chairman leon panetta dcalif said in an interview 
wednesday that he has been led to believe the details of the bush 
budget would be submitted between feb 10 and feb 15 
however there is still a question over whether bush will provide 
enough information to satisfy congress bush is being urged by some 
advisers to provide only a broad outline of spending goals rather 
than specific details 
senate appropriations chairman robert byrd dwva said 
wednesday that congress will be disappointed if bush does not 
provide enough details in his own spending plan 
i want to see the bush budget byrd said in an interview 
we have to see what his priorities are 
reagans final budget projected a 1990 deficit of 925 billion 
below the 100 billion target established by the grammrudman law 
that law established declining deficit targets for each year leading 
to a balanced budget in 1993 
while reagan met the grammrudman targets on paper critics 
charged that his budget relies on unrealistic assumptions about how 
fast the economy will grow it also calls for elimination of 82 
government programs all proposals which congress has rejected in 
the past

an attempt was apparently made to 
sabotage the piper alpha platform nine months before it was swept by 
fire in the worlds worst oilfield disaster occidental petroleum 
corp said thursday as the official inquiry into the disaster began 
the platform which was operated by occidental and owned by the 
los angelesbased company and a consortium was swept by explosions 
and fire on july 6 last year the bodies of 136 of the 167 men who 
died have been recovered sixtytwo men survived 
occidental spokeswoman fiona mcghie said the suspected sabotage 
attempt was made in september 1987 at a time when the rig was 
temporarily out of operation she said a small number of small ball 
bearings were found in one of the rigs gas compressors and removed 
without incident 
this information has been made available to the inquiry she 
said adding that the ball bearings were found in the same area in 
which the explosions occurred 
i wouldnt like to hazard a guess on the consequences if the 
ball bearings were not found other than there could have been a 
serious incident she said in a telephone interview 
platform managers investigated the incident but nobody came 
forward to claim responsibility she said the government was not 
informed until after the july disaster she added 
the department of energy has already said the disaster was not 
caused by sabotage in a preliminary technical report it said a 
buildup of gas following a leak in the control module was thought to 
have been the cause 
lord douglas cullen who is conducting the inquiry with three 
expert assessors thursday dismissed a union leaders claim that the 
hearing would be restricted to narrow technical questions 
i am concerned with all evidence which has a tenable connection 
with what occurred the judge told survivors rescuers technical 
experts lawyers and observers at the opening day of the hearing 
the government has asked cullen to establish the cause of the 
disaster and recommend ways of preventing a recurrence 
threequarters of the platform collapsed into the sea and two 
sunken accommodation sections containing dozens of bodies were later 
recovered by cranes 
occidental petroleum plans to topple the 250foothigh stump of 
the shattered platform with explosives next month it said the 
wrecked rig endangers shipping 
the blazing piper alpha production platform lit up the night sky 
for 20 miles around as helicopters and rescue boats rushed to the 
rig the gasfed fires raged on sporadically until leaking and 
burning wells were finally brought under control by texan oil 
disaster specialist red adair on july 29

the stock market continued to push forward today 
surpassing the level where it stood just before the october 1987 
crash 
the dow jones average of 30 industrials rose 804 to 224679 by 
noon on wall street 
on oct 16 1987 the last session before the crash the 
closelywatched index closed at 224674 
gainers outnumbered losers today in nationwide trading of new 
york stock exchangelisted issues with 770 up 522 down and 555 
unchanged 
volume on the big board came to 9669 million shares at midday 
the labor department reported that the consumer price index rose 
03 percent in december bringing the increase in the index for all 
of 1988 to 44 percent 
the latest monthly figure was a bit lower than most advance 
estimates by financial economists and thus helped contribute to a 
generally upbeat mood in the market 
however brokers say the markets recent strength has not seemed 
to derive from current economic news but rather from a gradual 
easing of the fears that have persisted ever since the crash 
as stock prices have risen lately they have attracted fresh 
buying from investing institutions and other market participants who 
began to worry that their caution might cause them to miss a 
significant rally 
theres a better feeling from the market itself said michael 
metz an analyst with oppenheimer amp co 
metz said the continued strength in the dollar also boosted stock 
prices when the dollar is higher traders believe the federal 
reserve is less likely to tighten credit 
a stronger dollar also makes us investments more attractive to 
foreigners 
leading the nyses most active list was lyondell petrolem which 
was unchanged at 30 
digital equipment surged 5 to 104 after the company reported 
quarterly earnings that exceeded analysts estimates 
polaroid climbed 3 to 39 shamrock acquisition iii inc raised

consumer prices rose 44 percent in 1988 the 
same as a year earlier as hefty droughtinduced increases for 
groceries offset stable energy prices the government said today 
worry about inflationary pressures preoccupied many economists 
last year but that pressure has not produced an acceleration in 
inflation thus far 
the 44 percent gain in the labor departments consumer price 
index matched the 1987 increase which was the highest since 1981 
but was four times the 11 percent rate in 1986 a 25year low 
a 03 percent rise in the index in december which followed a 03 
percent november increase helped inflation finish the year at a 
moderate pace 
the summer drought which shriveled crops and seared pastures 
pushed food prices for the year up 52 percent the steepest rise 
since 1980 
poultry and egg prices jumped 179 percent and 165 percent 
respectively because of the drought 
on the other hand beef and pork prices which rose for the first 
six months of the year fell during the second half as farmers sent 
more animals to slaughter as a way of avoiding high feed costs 
energy for the year rose only a slight 05 percent following an 
82 percent jump in 1987 still they were far below levels before 
the 1986 oil glutwhen energy prices plummeted 197 percent 
fuel oil prices jumped 28 percent in december after falling for 
six consecutive months despite the december advance the price was 
63 percent below that of a year earlier electricity charges rose 
11 percent for the year while natural gas was unchanged 
gasoline prices were 11 percent lower than a year ago price 
increases for new and used cars also were moderate 21 percent and 
34 percent respectively however the prices of auto insurance and 
of financing car purchases took steep jumps of 84 percent and 83 
percent respectively 
the cost of medical care up 69 percent also rose faster than 
the general inflation rate last year 
tobacco prices posted one of the steepest rises of any 
subcatagory up 94 percent for the year 
clothing prices rose 48 percent overall with mens and boys 
apparel up 60 percent and womens and girls clothing up 34 
percent 
decembers 03 percent increase left the price index at 1205 
percent of its 198284 base meaning that a hypothetical selection 
of goods costing 100 during the base period would have cost 12050 
in december that figure was up 20 cents from november 
president reagan who is preparing to leave office friday has 
listed the taming of inflation as one of his proudest 
accomplishments under his predecessor jimmy carter the nation saw 
doubledigit price increases of 133 percent in 1979 and 125 
percent in 1980 
white house spokesman marlin fitzwater said the report shows that 
inflation continues to show signs of moderation inflation has 
been going down since september 
many economists worry that the country may be in for a taste of 
the bad old days this year they say tight labor markets and rising 
factory operating rates will inevitably lead to higher costs for 
consumers 
the factory operating rate in december was 842 percent the 
highest in nine years the higher the rate the greater the 
likelihood of shortages and price increases 
at 53 percent the unemployment rate was the lowest in 14 years 
labor shortages in some states particularly in the northeast have 
already pushed up wages for entrylevel jobs 
but other analysts say consumer resistance and foreign 
competition are helping to dampen price increases 
its difficult to pass along cost pressures said donald 
ratajczak an economist with georgia state university consumers 
will back off and wait a couple of months to see if they can get a 
price discount 
domestic production capacity pressures probably dont 
mean as much as they once did there are resources readily available 
offshore if our prices start to rise 
nevertheless the federal reserve board whose prime job as the 
nations central bank is keeping inflation under control has been 
pushing interest rates slowly but steadily higher since march in an 
effort to slow the economy and ease inflationary pressures 
cynthia latta an economist with data resources inc a 
lexington mass forecasting firm joined ratajczak in predicting 
only a modest speedup in price increases this year 
i have more confidence in the fed than i ever did she 
said i think theyll have real trouble getting inflation down to 
the 2 percent range but i think theyll keep it from accelerating

housing for the urban homeless and poor is a 
relentlessly growing issue one that housing people recognize must 
soon be confronted on the basis of facts rather than ideals hopes 
and dreams 
the fact is that the best efforts of banks builders and 
bureacrats havent been able to do much about urban land prices 
which account for a steadily growing portion of all housing costs 
land prices are a major culprit 
in 1949 land accounted for a mere 11 percent of a new 
singlefamily home or 1045 of the average 9500 sale price by 
1969 it had risen to 21 percent of the 26000 sale price or 
5460 by 1986 the percentage was 25 percent of a 92000 sales 
price or 22000 20 times the figure of 37 years earlier 
the rising price of land has all but aborted some ingenious 
attempts at keeping housing prices under control or affordable to a 
larger number of people 
mortgage lenders have devised loans in such enormous variety they 
can almost be customized adjustable rate mortgages graduated 
payment loans 15year mortgages biweekly mortgages growing 
equity shared equity loans 
local governments have devised mortgage revenue bonds in which 
the credit of the community is used to develop housing they have 
bought up abandoned housing they have developed sweat equity 
programs 
the federal government has encouraged the bundling of mortgages 
into securities that are offered to investors thus bringing in a 
new flow of funds from the secondary market the tax system has been 
employed in various ways 
the private home mortgage insurance system has encouraged banks 
to lend to young families with just 5 percent down rather than the 
more conventional 20 percent the veterans administration and 
federal housing administration also have encouraged such liberal 
lending 
suppliers of building materials have experimented with new 
lowercost products and pressured communities that stuck to dated 
restrictive building and zoning codes they have built lowprice 
demonstration houses 
the prefabricated housing industry which creates precut 
panelized and modular or sectional homes has demonstrated it can 
produce quality housing at savings over onsite construction same 
for mobile or manufactured homes 
developers and builders have done their share learning to put 
more housing on less land better product delivery systems and 
building techniques have helped lower materiallabor costs to 47 
percent of price in 1986 from 69 percent in 1949 
meanwhile a study of 30 metropolititan areas by the urban land 
institute an independent washingtonbased study group illustrates 
the worsening of the landprice situation 
the institute found that while the consumer price index rose 52 
percent from 1975 to 1980 the median value of raw housing sites 
rose 927 percent other studies suggest the gap might have widened 
since then 
whats the answer some analysts maintain that buying and holding 
raw land is just too good a deal for speculators and investors not 
to exploit it 
consider some of the benefits of ownership while foresight is 
needed a great amount of business acumen isnt required and there 
are few if any operational problems nothing need be done to the 
land but wait for others to pour money and development expertise 
into abutting or nearby property 
true there may be no immediate income from land left idle and 
there are taxes to pay 
those taxes however are often minimal compared with benefits 
such as when taxpayers build at their expense a highway adjacent to 
the property or when a builder wants the land for a housing 
development 
some critics of taxing policy say it might be at fault 
instead of taxing the developers of raw land they contend that 
perhaps we should tax the owner of idle land or perhaps charge 
the landowner for taxpayer improvements such as highways and 
bridges that improve value

coalrich shaanxi province is running out of the 
fossil fuel that keeps its power plants running 
luxury hotels in beijing have been told to cut energy use by 30 
percent during peak hours and factories are being forced to shut 
down assembly lines to ease power shortages 
across china millions of workers are idled and homes are 
darkened every day as the nations surging demand for energy far 
outstrips its ability to generate power 
the problem is made worse by an inefficient transportation 
system antiquated machinery delays in construction of new 
facilities and unreasonably low energy rates 
the peoples daily said wednesday that shaanxis seven power 
stations which supply more than half the electricity in 
northwestern china are down to reserves of only 80000 tons of coal 
the coal shortfalls persisted through the second half of 1988 
the newspaper said one problem has been that coal mines in shaanxi 
which has reserves of 9096 billion tons have shipped coal to other 
provinces to get a better price 
china produced about 900 million tons of coal last year more 
than any country in the world but chronic shortages in some areas 
worsened as a result of transport bottlenecks and poor distribution 
coal is used for about 70 percent of chinas generating capacity 
of 100 million kilowatts of electricity the rest comes from 
hydroelectric power two nuclear power plants are under 
construction but china has no operating nuclear reactors 
the official china daily said tuesday the lack of suitable coal 
and deterioration of machines in power plants were causing serious 
power shortages in the capital 
residents in the northwest section of the city had no power 
during the evening hours three days a week and 200 large factories 
were told they will lose 40 percent of their power supply during 
peak morning and evening hours on some days 
the daily said a 2000employee towel factory will have to find 
menial work for 300 workers during peak electricity hours because 
their production line will be shut down 
about 100 hotels including luxury hotels catering to western 
tourists have been asked to reduce electricity use by 30 percent 
during peak hours 
last year the city banned the use of air conditioners and 
electric heaters in all public buildings excepting such places as 
hospitals hotels movie theaters and laboratories 
coal supply shortages became so bad in coastal jiangsu province 
last year that 80 percent of enterprises temporarily suspended 
production rice planting was delayed because there wasnt enough 
electricity to pump water into the fields 
in sichuan chinas most populous province power output fell 45 
percent short of needs as dry weather cut generating power at 
hydroelectric plants last winter in the nations largest city of 
shanghai power outages cost industries 16 million in one month 
last summer 
according to official reports in 1986 the nation lost 54 
billion of gross industrial output value and 8 billion in profits 
and taxes due to insufficient electricity 
china is trying to solve the energy crisis by building new 
railway lines to transport coal raising the cost of electricity and 
giving priority to energy projects 
an official of the newly formed china electric power enterprises 
federation said that by the year 2000 china hopes to reach 
generating capacity of 240 million kilowatts and produce 12 
trillion kilowatt hours annually both more than double current 
levels 
energy output must increase by at least that rate to keep up with 
the rapidly expanding economy and rising living standards that have 
made energy users such as televisions refrigerators and air 
conditioners available to urban families 
the amount of electricity produced increased 65 percent a year 
between 1980 and 1987 but average family use went up 20 percent 
annually in the same period

a tyson foods official said today the 
company is preparing to raise its bid for holly farms corp to 63 a 
share and that the deal is very close to completion 
holly farms directors met in new york on wednesday to consider 
takeover bids from the springdalebased tyson and from conagra of 
omaha neb tyson previously offered 60 a share 
they havent really put the stamp of approval on it yet said 
bob justice tyson vice president for community relations there 
are little complications we think are sure to be ironed out 
meanwhile a spokesman for holly farms in memphis tenn said 
as of 815 no decision has been made and without a decision there 
is no announcement 
i dont think anyone has more at stake than tyson said leeam 
lowin a greenwich conn investor and former holly farms 
shareholder chicken is their whole world conagra is into other 
things if there is no deal tyson would have the most likelihood of 
having troubled times in the future 
officials on all sides of the longrunning battle for control of 
holly farms and leadership of the us chicken industry declined 
comment wednesday 
conagra executives declined to say whether they raised their bid 
for holly farms 
if holly farms board recommends a sale to conagra and if 
shareholders go along with that recommendation holly farms 
executives have said the company is expected to operate 
independently of the food conglomerate 
if the board recommends that shareholders sell their stock to 
tyson foods and the shareholders follow that advice holly farms 
will become part of the poultry empire founded by a man who ran out 
of gas in springdale and started what became the countrys largest 
chicken processor 
conagra is seeking court permission to proceed with a contract 
reached in november to acquire holly farms 
we intend to stick by our guns conagra spokesman walt casey 
said wednesday 
tyson foods the nations largest poultry processor has been 
trying since october to take over holly farms a diversified company 
heavily involved in fresh poultry sales 
resisting those advances holly farms managers worked out a 
merger agreement with conagra but a delaware court blocked it on a 
request from tyson 
casey said conagra asked the court tuesday for permission to 
continue with the holly farms deal though it will likely lead to 
lengthy litigation 
jim blair a tyson lawyer said holly farms managers have tried 
to favor conagra in setting rules for receiving bids but holly 
farms spokesman ted bailey denied the allegation 
tysons 60 per share offer was valued at more than 1 billion 
conagra has proposed a stock swap also worth about 1 billion 
blair said holly managers have asked their board to amend a stock 
bonus plan for about 600 management employees 
the change would require a company buying holly farms for cash to 
pay those employees a total of 60 million blair said 
in its court challenge that stopped the hollyconagra merger 
tyson said holly farms managers were ignoring the best interest of 
their shareholders by not considering all buyout offers equally

the story goes that george g blaisdell a 
pennsylvania oilman watched in 1932 as a friend tried to light his 
cigarette with a cumbersome twopiece austrian lighter 
youre all dressed up blaisdell said why dont you get a 
lighter that looks decent 
well george the friend replied it works 
so was born the trusty zippo lighter an american folk object 
that stands for american durability in blaisdells oldfashioned 
way blaisdell didnt just guarantee his lighters he guaranteed 
them for life no questioned asked 
the zippo manufacturing co based in the northern pennsylvania 
town of bradford is the last american cigarette lighter 
manufacturer the company shipped its 200millionth metal lighter a 
couple of months ago 
company officials who offered the blaisdell anecdote say 
blaisdells promise set zippos apart from the competition foreign 
and domestic 
zippos are some of the finest said eddie dektor a 
pittsburgh gift shop owner who has amassed 3000 lighters including 
more than 150 zippos during the past 30 years 
they work very well he said the mechanism and the 
workmanship and everything is great they also were the only company 
ever to give you a lifetime guarantee 
despite a decline in the number of smokers and the popularity of 
disposable lighters business is better than ever for zippo said 
spokesman william w jones 
the introduction of cheap disposable lighters in the 1960s 
actually was good for zippo converting match users to use of both 
disposables and metal lighters jones said 
it made the country more lighter conscious he said 
the privately owned company does not release detailed financial 
figures but jones said sales in 1987 topped 37 million and more 
than 80 percent of zippo purchasers buy them as gifts 
zippos slowest year was 1964 the same year the us surgeon 
general placed health warnings on cigarette packs 
even then we had a good year jones said sales just didnt 
grow as fast as they did in other years 
dektor said zippos are history and a symbol of enduring quality 
in the modernday age of planned obsolescence 
according to zippo blaisdell set up shop in a garage in 
bradford a city that boasts it was once capital of the worlds oil 
production in the late 19th century 
jones said blaisdell obtained us distribution rights for the 
austrian lighter used by his friend but he could not sell them at a 
profit until he improved their design making them more attractive 
and easier to use 
blaisdells fascination with another recent invention the 
zipper invented in nearby meadville led him to call his new 
lighter zippo jones said 
the lighters achieved worldwide fame during world war ii after 
war correspondent ernie pyle publicized them the company says 
blaisdell became known as mr zippo in pyle newspaper columns 
after blaisdell offered to distribute zippo lighters to servicemen 
overseas 
zippos entire wartime production was supplied to the military 
where they were used to light smoking lamps and campfires in swamps 
and jungles cook soup in helmets and light signal fires not 
counting lighting gis cigarettes from berlin to bataan 
the company said one pilot landed his disabled plane safely by 
using a lighter to illuminate his darkened instrument panel there 
are stories of servicemen saved when bullets were deflected off 
lighters carried in pockets 
generals douglas mcarthur and dwight eisenhower wrote blaisdell 
testimonial letters saying his lighters never failed 
blaisdell died in 1978 at age 83 in miami beach fla 
today the company is owned by blaisdells daughters sarah b 
dorn and harriett b wick and the lighters conservative design has 
changed little since the companys founding jones said 
about 200000 dropped crushed mutilated or unhinged lighters 
are returned every year and are repaired and returned or replaced 
within 48 hours of their arrival jones said few people abuse the 
policy 
we find that there are so many honest people out there its 
amazing he said 
zippo once received a damaged lighter from a san francisco 
security guard who had been the target of a gunman the guard had 
been carrying the lighter in his front shirt pocket jones said 
he was confronted by someone who was trying to break in his 
building and was shot at pointblank range he said 
the guard told the company he thought he had been shot in the 
chest but found the bullet lodged in the lighter when he pulled it 
out of his pocket jones said 
zippos remain a favorite of lighter maniacs collectors who 
sometimes acquire several thousand lighters as a hobby 
i used to get them at flea markets at house sales and at 
antique shops dektor said after a while i developed an 
obsession about them i used to get up about 5 am on sunday and 
hit four flea markets in one day 
earlier this year dektor stopped adding to his collection 
today hes content to browse through them recounting the stories 
behind some lighters pointing out favorites showing off unusual 
pieces 
about 1200 of dektors lighters are displayed in two cases in 
his small store an eightpiece commemorative set featuring profiles 
of elvis presley bought this summer during a tour of zippos plant 
is displayed on one wall 
collections of longtime lighter enthusiasts can range in value 
from 5000 to 20000 with individual lighters usually costing 
about 3 said tom prylinski of erie president of the lighter side 
a 5yearold lighter collectors club the lighter side has about 
110 members in the united states australia england and france

apple computer inc on thursday unveiled a 
new model in its macintosh computer line one that runs four times 
faster than the macintosh se 
the announcement came two days after it lowered prices on some of 
its other products 
dubbed the macintosh se30 the new system packs about the same 
power as apples topoftheline macintosh ii in a computer that 
appears identical to the earlier transportable macintosh products 
apple will show off the new computer at macworld expo in san 
francisco this week 
apple chairman john sculley said he expected the se30 to play a 
vital role in apples success comparing it to the companys earlier 
macintosh plus the first macintosh computer with features for 
business use 
some industry observers say the se30 lacks the dramatic 
innovation of some earlier apple products 
they said the same thing about the macintosh plus sculley 
said almost everybody in the media panned it and all it did was 
save the company

entertainer wayne newton said today he will 
accept a 6 million libel award in his longrunning lawsuit against 
nbc saying he feels vindicated from a nearly 9yearold report that 
linked him to the mafia 
this was not a matter of money newton told reporters at a 
morning news conference this was a matter of vindication of my 
name 
newtons attorney morton galane said the interest accrued on 
the reduced 53 million award now equals 6 million 
such an award would be higher than any libel award ever 
affirmed by an appellate court in the united states he said 
the case does not yet appear to be over however nbc attorneys 
had indicated earlier they would appeal the award to higher federal 
courts 
newton said that as far as he was concerned the case was over for 
him personally he said that if nbc appeals he will leave the matter 
to his attorneys 
galane told reporters that one factor in newtons decision to 
accept the award was a survey of public attitudes toward newtons 
acceptance of such a high award 
three weeks ago that survey confirmed that the public believes 
that the reporting of a high libel award in favor of mr newton 
would be perceived by others as restoration of a positive public 
image galane said 
in late december us district judge myron crocker gave newton 
until feb 1 to accept the award which had been reduced from 228 
million or face the prospect of proving his case against nbc in a 
new trial 
newton won the original amount against the network when a jury 
ruled the singer was defamed in a series of broadcasts that linked 
him to organized crime figures 
crocker later threw out all but 53 million of the award and 
gave newton the option of accepting the money or seeking a new trial 
strictly on damages 
the newtonnbc case stems from an oct 6 1980 broadcast titled 
wayne newton and the law 
nbc correspondent brian ross reported that newton had gone to 
organized crime figure guido penosi for help after his 
then3yearold daughters life had been threatened 
newton argued the report left the impression that his october 
1980 purchase of the aladdin hotel in las vegas was linked to 
organized crime the hotel has since been sold and is currently 
owned by a japanese businessman 
asked today if he would again ask for penosis help newton said 
i would go to the devil himself to save my daughters life 
newton emphasized that his lawsuit was not meant to suppress 
reporting of the news 
all i hope is that responsible journalists will think before 
they do to someone what they did to me he said

farley inc extended its 14 billion hostile 
tender offer for west pointpepperell inc on thursday and asked a 
federal judge to invalidate another of the textile companys 
takeover defenses 
it was the eighth extension in farleys tender offer which is 
48 per share the deadline which has been bumped back a week to 
two weeks at a time since it was first set for nov 21 now is set 
for midnight jan 25 
in a motion filed in us district court the chicagobased 
conglomerate which controls fruit of the loom inc and acme boot 
co asked judge g ernest tidwell to invalidate pepperells 
socalled flipover provisions that would allow its shareholders 
to buy shares at a discount in an uninvited suitor 
most analysts however view the legal wrangling as delaying 
tactics giving pepperell management time to put together their own 
response 
in trading on the new york stock exchange pepperell was up 37 
cents a share at 4562 at midafternoon 
in extending the tender offer farley said it currently has 
received tender offers for about 14 million shares which together 
with the 29 million shares farley already owns account for about 57 
percent of pepperells outstanding shares 
the amount of shares tendered has varied little since late 
december but farley officials said that is to be expected 
farleys offer for the west point gabased company is 
contingent on being tendered or owning outright twothirds of 
pepperells outstanding shares as well as overturning the textile 
companys takeover defenses and voiding georgias antitakeover law 
the motion filed with tidwell on thursday was placed under seal 
as has much of the evidence in previous court challenges of the 
takeover 
but farley said in a statement that the flipover provision 
has no legitimate business purpose and harms west points 
shareholders 
even though farley is not publicly traded the flipover 
would allow pepperell shareholders to purchase farley shares at a 
discount effectively reducing william farleys control of his own 
company 
tidwell previously has voided pepperells flipin provisions 
which give shareholders the right to purchase more pepperell stock 
at a deep discount 
that ruling has been appealed to the 11th us circuit court of 
appeals where a decision is pending 
tidwell also is considering farleys claim that the states 1988 
antitakeover law is unconstitutional a courtappointed expert told 
tidwell last week that he believed the conditions set on mergers 
were too restrictive and therefore improperly restrained trade 
a ruling had been expected last week but there currently is no 
indication of when one will come 
farley also has succeeded in calling a special shareholders 
meeting for feb 25 where his company will seek to oust current 
pepperell directors replacing them with its own slate which then 
would toss out the takeover defenses 
pepperell is the nations largest publicly traded textile 
company with products including martex towels and sheets and arrow 
shirts

foreign currency traders who want to make a 
mark on the market can make one first with a snowball friday when 
the philadelphia stock exchange opens expanded early morning trading 
hours 
the exchange is introducing a 430 am starting time 3 hours 
earlier than its current opening time to let currency trading 
coincide with morning hours in europe a halfhour before the 
opening the exchange is hosting a snowball throwing contest 
officials expect could become a snowball fight 
maybe if we throw a snowball in somebodys face theyll 
listen exchange president nicholas giordano said thursday 
sometimes youve got to do something corny to get peoples 
attention to listen to the substance 
the new hours will be 430 am to 230 pm and 6 pm to 10 
pm the latter period begun in september 1987 to cover the 
japanese morning hours 
giordano said he couldnt estimate what kind of volume to expect 
with the new hours but said there is demand for the change 
in our visits to our members and customers in europe they have 
been requesting these hours for some time now giordano said 
adding they have had to to sit around to 1 pm local time 
waiting for the 8 am opening of the philadelphia exchange 
whether some of that business will move from the afternoon to 
the morning and how much will be new business remains to be seen 
he said 
david cohen vice president of tague securities the exchanges 
designated specialist firm in the german mark and the japanese yen 
said the new trading hours will mean less sleep for him but more 
convenience for the europeans 
as for the snowball throwing cohen expects to be at the exchange 
by 4 am getting ready for the trading day 
hopefully i wont get hit in the head he said 
lacking snow in a mild winter officials are trucking it in and

snowball throwers will have five official targets symbols of 
some of the eight foreign currencies traded at the exchange but 
others may develop 
the temptation of having a snowball in your hand and throwing

so does the stock exchange president have a target or two in 
mind 
i do but im not going to disclose them he said

the recent speculationfueled rise in the dollar 
could cause longterm damage to the us trade balance by making 
american goods less competitive in world markets 
trade flows respond slowly but surely to changes in currency 
rates economists say if the dollars latest rise lasts it could 
halt or even reverse progress toward shrinking the trade gap 
as the worlds largest debtor the united states eventually will 
have to produce a trade surplus in order to generate enough money to 
keep up on rent interest and dividends to foreigners 
on thursday the dollar fell against most major currencies in 
response to dollarselling by major central banks but since its 
lows of late november the dollar is up 6 percent against the 
japanese yen and 8 percent against the west german mark 
the dollar actually is not far above its levels of a year ago 
the problem is that many economists believe the dollar needs to be 
falling to promote us exports and keep a lid on imports 
if exports do respond nicely to dollar changes what do we have 
ahead of us now that the dollar is no longer falling donald 
ratajczak head of georgia state universitys economic forecasting 
center said thursday 
the dollar appeared to defy gravity this week when it surged 
upward despite reports of an unexpectedly large us trade deficit 
and a record japanese trade surplus 
analysts say currency dealers who once panicked at the slightest 
evidence of deterioration in us trade have decided they can 
safely ignore trade figures 
they may be partially right the central banks of the big 
industrial democracies are suspending the economic law of gravity by 
committing themselves to keeping a floor under the dollar 
without meaning to the central banks are making the world safe 
for speculators foreign investors believe they can put money in 
dollars to take advantage of high us interest rates without 
worrying that the dollar will be allowed to crash and wipe out their 
gains 
having tested the dollars lows shortly after the election of 
george bush in november speculators are testing the highest levels 
that the central banks will tolerate 
in the way it has swept skeptics aside the dollars 
juggernautlike rise resembles the rise in stocks in the bull market 
of summer 1987 which preceded the october crash of that year 
if you push the dollar up enough then people will start 
wavering in their longerterm views and at a certain point theyll 
throw in their towel and join in the buying said stephen leach a 
currency analyst at chemical bank 
a cheaper dollar is not a cureall for americas trade ills of 
course the united states has to take action on other fronts such 
as saving more and making goods the rest of the world wants 
still a lowpriced currency helps the brilliant performance of 
the us export sector last year was a late but direct result of the 
dollars decline in 1985 through 1987 
while currency traders have chosen to ignore the trade gap lately 
and focus instead on the us interest rate advantage it seems 
inevitable that persistent trade gaps will eventually demand 
attention 
the central banks ability to intervene is puny compared to the 
size of the worldwide foreignexchange market they may not be able 
to keep the dollars decline orderly if psychology suddenly switches 
against it 
the dollar will go up until it reaches the point where 
everybody thinks its going to fall and then it will fall hard 
ratajczak predicted

the chairman of the house ways and means 
committee said thursday that lawmakers will have to consider how the 
economy would be affected if they try to crack down on corporate 
takeovers 
i think theres an appetite here on the capitol hill to do 
something the chairman rep dan rostenkowski dill told 
reporters the big question he added is whether we can write a 
law without causing a downturn in the economy 
as he has in the past rostenkowski indicated he thinks congress 
will act to reverse a recent trend that has seen a sharp increase in 
borrowing to finance corporate takeovers and other acquisitions 
including the use of leveraged buyouts however he declined to 
predict whether any law will be changed 
something really should be done particularly when we are 
seeing the junkbond abuse he said referring to highrisk 
highyield bonds that are often used to finance takoevers 
rostenkowski added he is concerned with the fact we shouldnt 
have a meat axe when we are engaged in writing law if we are going 
to write law 
at rostenkowskis insistence the house in 1987 approved some 
limitations on tax benefits associated with corporate borrowing but 
some analysts cited that action as one reason for the october stock 
market crash and the proposals were dropped 
some of the people who criticized us when we wrote that 
amendment are now suggesting theres a need for it rostenkowski 
said 
the senate finance committee and the ways and means committee 
have scheduled public hearings this month and next on takeovers and 
the broad subject of corporate financing in general 
rostenkowski noted several other house committees are planning 
their own investigations but he emphasized that his panel and the 
senate finance committee which control the tax law should have the 
major role 
you get their attention when you tickle the tax code he 
said the key question involved in the issue is how the law treats 
the deductibility of interest used to finance takoevers 
rostenkowski said 
economists say a major reason for the growing shift toward 
corporate debt and away from stocks is the fact a corporation can 
deduct interest on debt but not dividends on stock

a health advocate whose campaign helped prompt 
nine major food processors to start removing highly saturated 
vegetable oils from their products vowed thursday to continue his 
crusade until all such fats are eliminated 
the battle is far from won there are hundreds of products out 
there with highly saturated coconut and palm oil said phil 
sokolof 
sokolof a multimillionaire omaha businessman announced monday 
that five major food processors joined four others that earlier said 
they would work toward eliminating the tropical oils from their 
products 
our victory was getting nine food giants to switch to the good 
vegetable oils and hopefully the entire industry will follow he 
said in a telephone interview thursday 
but some food processors say switching to other fats is not as 
simple as just changing ingredients they say tropical oils impart a 
certain taste and texture to some foods such as cookies 
among products containing coconut and palm oils are crackers 
cookies candies cereals cooking ingredients desserts frozen 
foods canned goods and tv dinners 
ron wirtz the librarian of the american institute of baking in 
manhattan kan said tropical oils have other desirable properties 
such as a resistence to spoilage and lower cost than certain other 
vegetable oils in addition he said they are superior for use in 
frostings and coatings because they are stable at room temperature 
wirtz said the use of tropical oils in food products wasnt 
common until the late 1960s many made the switch because the oils 
were cheaper than alternative fats 
sokolof said he has spent 2 million of his own money on his 
cholesterolawareness campaign in november he placed fullpage ads 
in five newspapers warning of the dangers of tropical oils and 
listing brand names of products that contain them 
most people know that meat dairy products mcdonalds 
hamburgers are high in saturated fat they did not know that coconut 
and palm oil are he said 
saturated fats can increase blood cholesterol levels high 
cholesterol is a risk factor for heart attacks sokolof 66 blames 
high cholesterol for the nearfatal heart attack he suffered 22 
years ago 
sokolof said he will place additional newspaper ads but they may 
be broadened to include warnings about the health risks of eating 
certain dairy products and meats he also said he will point out the 
use of lard and beef tallow in certain processed foods 
the most important statistic the public should know is that for 
every 1 percent the cholesterol level is lowered the chance of 
having a heart attack is reduced 2 percent he said 
most of the companies that said they would phase out the use of 
tropical oils said they were responding to consumer and health 
concerns not pressure from sokolof 
sokolof said he believes his campaign was part of the companies 
decisionmaking process but agreed the public will be the ultimate 
reason food processors switch oils 
if the public reads ingredient labels and does not buy the 
highly saturated fat foods companies will get the message and 
respond he said 
sokolof established his nonprofit advocacy group the national 
heart savers association in 1975 
the nine companies that said they would eliminate tropical oils 
are general mills inc ralston purina co borden inc pillsbury 
co quaker oats co kellogg co sunshine biscuits inc campbell 
soup cos pepperidge farm division and keebler co

adolph coors co on thursday dropped the 
7monthold original draft label from its flagship beer saying 
too many customers thought the label change also signaled a taste 
change 
last july coors replaced its longtime banquet beer tag with 
the words original draft as part of an effort to update its 
packaging but the move backfired 
people believed we changed the beer said mike marranzino 
brand director for the brewery based in golden west of denver it 
looked like a new brand name to them but we didnt change the 
beer 
new labels on cans and bottles that will reach store shelves in 
three weeks simply will say coors marranzino said 
he said design changes made to the cans and packaging when the 
original draft name was added will be retained because beer drinkers 
like the contemporary look 
the coors experience in some ways recalls cocacola cos 
experiment in april 1985 when it replaced its original cola flavor 
with a new one the ensuing customer protest forced cocacola to 
bring back the old formula three months later renaming it cocacola 
classic 
marranzino said the original draft label was prompted by miller 
brewing cos successful advertising campaign promoting its bottled 
draft beer coors wanted to tell customers it had been making 
bottled draft beer for 30 years he said 
the other changes included toning down the can color from yellow 
to buff adding stripes to the can bottom and replacing the old 
redandwhite packaging with an updated redwhiteandblue diagonal 
design 
coors spokesman doyle albee said the label change had no 
discernible effect on earnings which reached record levels in 1988 
we are simply responding to requests from customers albee said 
added marrazino the use of original draft has not performed 
well for us and it has created enough confusion that we will simply 
remove the phrase keeping the new graphics look 
early signs of customer dissatisfaction surfaced last fall among 
coors loyalists in el paso texas and southern california sales 
fell in some liquor stores and taverns as cans and bottles bearing 
the new label replaced the old banquet beer labels 
last month coors announced it would reintroduce the banquet beer 
label in those two markets in an attempt to appease disgruntled 
customers 
marranzino said beer with the banquet beer label will continue to 
be shipped to el paso and southern california as long as they want 
it

cooling a rally that had brought the us currency to its highest 
levels since early october 
gold bullion prices were modestly higher in light dealings 
republic national bank of new york said gold was bid at 40360 a 
troy ounce as of 4 pm est up from 40175 late wednesday 
foreign exchange dealers said one round of dollarselling by nine 
central banks was unsuccessful but a second round drove the dollar 
lower against most currencies 
dollar sales were accompanied by west germanys central bank 
raising two key interest rates a step intended to make yields on 
german securities more attractive and keep investors from switching 
from marks to dollars 
the dollar had gotten as high as 1298 japanese yen and 188 
marks before the successful attack by the central banks at 
midmorning in new york

new york 
it just cant continue at this momentum since january weve 
had a oneway direction up he said

rise looks more like a return to reality or a correction

consumer prices rose 03 percent and housing construction fell 22 
percent in december

an investment group that specializes in 
employeeled corporate buyouts is poised to bid for troubled eastern 
airlines a report published thursday said 
the atlanta constitution reported that louis o kelso a san 
francisco lawyer and a leading promoter of employee buyouts said 
the group is almost ready to approach the board of directors of 
texas air corp easterns parent 
the group organized last october as grandview acquisition corp 
among the investors involved in grandview is former cbs inc 
president john backe the constitution said 
a spokeswoman for kelso reached in new york said no one was 
available to comment on the report thursday 
texas air spokesman art kent declined to comment on the buyout 
effort except to emphasize that texas air chairman frank lorenzo 
has repeatedly said eastern is not for sale 
eastern union officials also declined to discuss the buyout 
effort 
it is very sensitive said charles e bryan president of the 
8500member eastern unit of the international association of 
machinists and aerospace workers 
kelso reportedly acknowledged that grandview has yet to arrange 
all of the financing needed to buy miamibased eastern which 
analysts have speculated could go for between 600 million and 800 
million 
kelso told the constitution he does not expect financing to be a 
problem even though eastern is nearly 25 billion in debt is 
losing 1 million a day and has lost what were its two most valuable 
assets those assets included the system one computer reservation 
system which is now a separate texas air subsidiary and the 
washingtonnew yorkboston shuttle which is being sold to developer 
donald j trump for 365 million 
i think that eastern can be structured in a way that it could 
be a good opportunity said kelso who developed many of the 
financing methods now used in employee stock ownership plans known 
as esops 
the degree of employee ownership envisioned by grandview and the 
concessions that would be required of easterns workers has not been 
fully determined said kelso and others familiar with the effort 
easterns unions have been seeking employee ownership of the 
airline for years kelso was involved in an unsuccessful esop effort 
in the months before texas air bought eastern in late 1986 
easterns unions have made no secret of their desire to force 
lorenzo to sell the airline

richard darman george bushs designated budget 
director told congress thursday he would recommend a tax increase 
only if the nation faced a crisis so severe that there was no 
alternative 
darman at his confirmation hearing sought to fend off democrats 
probing whether bush might circumvent his presidential campaign 
pledge to seek no new taxes perhaps by using a different name for 
revenue raisers 
i think the president meant no new taxes as it would ordinarily 
be understood by ordinary americans darman told the senate 
governmental affairs committee i think the burden of that is the 
duck test if it looks lke a duck its a duck 
but darman who said he strongly believes that bush accepts 
the duck test conceded under questioning by sen carl levin 
dmich that there was an exception to the rule 
asked by levin if such exceptions would include a deficit that 
threatens our economic health darman said it would only if there 
was no other way to address the problem 
but he added i am not now recommending in any way to the 
incoming president that he violate the duck test and i do not now 
foresee the circumstances in which i should or would do so 
darman said that in deciding whether to recommend new taxes he 
would also consider the effect such a choice would have on the 
presidents credibility which he said is extremely important 
so i would not use exclusively the deficit as a test he said 
darman was one of three bush nominees to go before congress this 
week senate panels on thursday recommended confirmation of two 
others secretary of statedesignate james a baker iii and labor 
secretarydesignate elizabeth dole 
during a break in his hearing darman told reporters that he 
meant his testimony to give the impression that he was closing the 
door to any new taxes 
he said he believed that new taxes would only be acceptable in 
time of war a comment that seemed to contradict his earlier 
statements that a severe economic crisis might also trigger new 
taxes 
darman told the senators that his definition of taxes would 
include new levies on gasoline employeeprovided fringe benefits 
putting state and local government workers in a medicare payroll 
deduction program and eliminating the deduction for interest paid 
on home mortgages 
but he also stated that most people would not consider the 
renewal of a tax otherwise due to expire as a new tax he cited the 
3 percent excise tax on local and longdistance telephone service 
which is scheduled to expire at the end of next year but is 
considered a likely candidate for renewal 
and he said he would not consider a new tax to be one that bush 
has ever proposed before or even been associated with before 
darman also said he was not sure how long bushs pledge against 
new taxes might last but added we might as well assume forever 
darman is expected to have little trouble winning senate 
confirmation to the job of director of the office of management and 
budget 
but with the governments 155 billion deficit looming as one of 
this years major political battles darman came under questions 
from lawmakers about the shape of next years spending plan 
democrats have been trying to pressure bush into submitting a 
detailed budget showing how he would address the improvements to 
education the environment and other programs he promised during the 
campaign yet reduce the deficit without raising taxes they believe 
such a spending plan must include new revenues or spending cuts that 
would be unbearably severe 
darman said he expected bush to submit revisions to president 
reagans 115 trillion fiscal 1990 budget by midfebruary 
he also said the bush administration wants to reach a negotiated 
budget that would satisfy congress and the white house he sought to 
play down earlier reports that the new administration would rather 
face the automatic spending cuts required by the grammrudman 
deficit reduction law than raise taxes 
the grammrudman law says that if the deficit cannot be reduced 
to 100 billion this year domestic and defense programs must be 
slashed until the imbalance reaches that level 
i am not trying in any way to use this as a club he said of 
those automatic cuts 
he also said it was his very strong suspicion that bush would 
use the same economic assumptions reagan relied on in his spending 
blueprint those projections which include lower interest rates and 
higher growth rates than many outside economists expect would help 
the government lower its deficit by increasing the revenues it 
collects and decreasing the benefits it must pay out 
darman 55 spent parts of the 1970s and most of the 1980s 
working for six cabinet agencies and the white house he resigned 
from the no 2 job at the treasury department in april 1987 to take 
a job with the investment banking division of shearson lehman 
brothers and worked as an adviser to bush during the presidential 
campaign 
sen john glenn dohio the panels chairman said he hoped the 
committee would finish its hearing and approve darmans nomination 
on monday the full senate could approve the appointment as early as 
wednesday

when it became embroiled in the ivan boesky insider trading scandal 
kidder agreed in 1987 to pay a thenrecord 253 million settle 
civil charges with the securities and exchange commission 
the episode also prompted ge to make aggressive management 
changes at the firm in response to what it perceived as management 
weaknesses to led to kidders involvement in the scandal 
the management shakeups at kidder are seen by many as 
highlighting the problems that can occur when smokestack companies 
try to bring new types of business into their corporate fold as has 
happened frequently this decade 
ge management generally has gotten excellent marks for the 
handling of its expansion into financial services but analysts say 
some clashes are inevitable even in the most carefully handled 
situations 
while wall streeters pride themselves on an entreprenuerial 
spirit they often are criticized for following a strategy that 
focuses on shortterm rewards at the expense of longterm planning 
its tough for industrial companies to own wall street 
financial firms they drive the creative people out creative people 
feel limited suffocated said one analyst who asked not to be 
named its not like running an insurance company or a bank 
earlier this week two senior members of kidders merchant 
banking group announced they were leaving the firm 
but in response to recent reports indicating ge may be sorry it 
bought kidder lawrence a bossidy vice chairman of ge financial 
services stated ge was not disappointed with kidders 1988 results 
he said kidders operating net income came to nearly 50 million in 
1988 up about 20 percent over 1987 
on thursday ge reported its net income rose to 101 billion in 
the fourth quarter the first time quarterly earnings have exceeded 
1 billion for all of 1988 ge earned 339 billion after taxes up 
16 percent from 292 bllion in 1987 the earnings benefited from a 
strong showing by ge financial services the largest single ge 
business 
bossidy also emphatically denied reports that disenchantment with 
the profitability of the securities business could induce ge to sell 
off kidders retail business which could lead to the dismissal of 
2000 employees 
kidder underwent a major restructuring beginning in the wake of 
the october 1987 stock market crash as did most major wall streete 
firms to consolidate and reduce costs

the state treasury has canceled a 110 
million commitment to the company acquiring rjr nabisco inc because 
of michigans new law banning investments in business with ties to 
south africa 
foes of south africas racesegregation system said thursday they 
welcomed the decision a day earlier by state treasurer robert bowman 
to scrap the investment in a fund run by kohlberg kravis roberts amp 
co the firm buying rjr in a takeover valued at a record 2453 
billion 
i think its a courageous decision in line with the spirit of 
the legislation said state rep perry bullard one of the 
sponsors of the measure banning south africanrelated investments 
rjr a foodandtobacco giant with products ranging from oreo 
cookies to salem cigarettes agreed to sell itself to kohlberg late 
last year 
based in atlanta rjr is one of 95 us companies with south 
african involvement according to a list bowman compiled in 
compliance with the law which took effect jan 1 
the measure bans new investments of state pension funds in 
companies involved in south africa until that whiteruled nation 
drops its policy of racial segregation known as apartheid or until 
the companies sever their ties with the country 
it also requires the 16 billion pension fund to sell off over 
the next five years the 5 billion in investments it holds in south 
africaninvolved companies 
bullard and state sen virgil smith ddetroit another sponsor 
of the divestiture measure said they had talked privately to bowman 
and argued against the kohlberg investment 
my reaction is a positive one smith said he did what i 
wanted him to do 
bowmans decision makes michigan the second state to back out of 
participating in kohlbergs fund for the acquisition of rjr 
massachusetts withdrew earlier 
kohlberg officials referred inquiries to its public relations 
company kekst and co in new york but officials there didnt 
return three telephone calls seeking reaction to the michigan 
decision 
the apartheid foes praise of bowman was in contrast to the 
criticism they heaped on the treasurer when he decided to invest 
335 million in south africaninvolved companies shortly before the 
divestiture law took effect jan 1 
treasury spokesman robert kolt said the two situations were 
different because the state had completed those purchases before the 
investment ban took effect 
we havent actually released the money yet to kohlberg which 
would take place after the law took effect so thats the problem 
he said

a onemonth record of 701 billion in deposits 
flowed out of the nations savings institutions in november as 
increases in interest paid on deposits lagged behind the market the 
government said thursday 
the federal home loan bank board which regulates about 3000 
federally insured sampls said it was the seventh consecutive month of 
net withdrawals which from may through november totaled 164 
billion 
in the seven months from october 1987 through last april 281 
billion in new deposits had flowed into sampls as investors fleeing 
stock market turmoil sought the safety of federallyinsured accounts 
james barth chief economist at the bank board attributed 
novembers deposit drain to the fact that sampls on average 
increased the rates offered on oneyear certificates of deposit by 
only 013 percentage points 
that compares with gains of about 020 percentage points on 
commercial bank deposits and mutual funds and 053 percentage points 
on us treasury bills he said 
barth said the lag in rates paid on sampl deposits indicated 
thrifts at least in november have been able to resist market 
pressures driving up their cost of doing business 
many analysts have been worried about how well the industry would 
be able to cope with rising interest rates 
however james christian chief economist of the us league of 
saving institutions said the big deposit drain was worrisome he 
said mortgage rates have also lagged other kinds of interest rates 
and speculated that sampls are taking in fewer deposits because 
theyre having a harder time making a profit on mortgage lending 
theres been a significant cost squeeze so some managers 
may be saying why take it in if i cant make a profit on it 
christian said 
i do not read this at all as a situation where the industry is 
having trouble attracting deposits said economist martin regalia 
of the national council of savings institutions i read this 
as a situation where wise institutions are backing away 
he added some of the money that came out of the stock market 
is going to go back into the market now that it is doing better 
one of regulators goals in the recent spate of sampl closings 
particularly in texas has been to reduce the number of unhealthy 
institutions paying high interest rates on deposits because that in 
turn had driven up the cost of funds for all sampls 
barth said in november a california sampl allowed a deposit runoff 
of 1 billion at a new jersey institution it acquired in a 
governmentassisted deal he was apparently referring to first 
nationwide of san franciscos purchase of lincoln federal savings 
and loan association of westfield nj 
also in line with regulators plans 10 thrifts in the southwest 
had 17 billion in deposits flow out he said

earthmoving giant caterpillar inc on 
thursday reported that its profit slipped 41 percent in the fourth 
quarter of 1988 while soaring to record levels for the year as a 
whole 
caterpillars fourthquarter earnings declined to 163 million 
or 161 a share from 170 million or 167 a share in the 
yearearlier quarter 
the decline occurred despite an increase in revenue for the 
quarter to 266 billion from 224 billion 
for the 1988 fiscal year the company said it posted the highest 
sales and profit in its history boosted by surging demand for farm 
equipment 
annual earnings jumped 76 percent to 616 million from 350 
million the year before 
revenue for the year increased to 1043 billion from 818 
billion 
the only appropriate word to describe 1988 financial results is 
excellent said len kuchan company treasurer were very 
pleased to have a record year but were not popping any 
champagne were too busy working on 1989 
if theres no celebration its due to the memory of the 
companys disastrous performance after its 1981 triumph 
caterpillars market collapsed due to overcapacity in the industry 
and fierce competition at home and abroad and a strong dollar 
further weakened its ability to compete overseas 
a strict costcutting program including plant closings and 
18000 layoffs in the peoria area helped caterpillar survive 950 
million in losses and serious labor turmoil over the next three 
years 
vigilance is the word of the day our competition is still very 
strong kuchan said 
he attributed caterpillars strong 1988 performance to a huge 
surge in demand for its equipment 
we were running sales volumes last year that were not 
anticipated until 1991 kuchan said we were not expecting the 
kind of sales strength we experienced that evolved in every major 
sales category and in every region of the world the demand was 
universal especially on the replacement market 
kuchan said caterpillar officials were aware that much of the 
companys equipment in the field was aging and in need of 
replacement but never expected the demand that developed 
kuchan said the company remains guarded about its profits outlook 
despite forecasting that 1989 would bring another record in sales 
he said earnings likely will only match the 1988 record performance 
and not grow significantly due to increasing costs in numerous 
areas 
our costs are still too high were still not happy with the 
return on shareholders investments he said but 1989 still 
will be a good year 
caterpillar sales in the united states were 507 billion in 
1988 an increase of 18 percent from 1987 
foreign sales accounted for 518 billion of caterpillars 
business last year or about 33 percent over the 1987 level 
caterpillars worldwide workforce stood at 60558 at the end of 
the fourth quarter an increase of 6095 over employment levels for 
the yearearlier period

a federal grand jury returned a longpromised 
superseding indictment of princetonnewport partners officials 
thursday adding 33 more counts but no new defendants to the 
previous racketeering and fraud charges 
five partners in the securities firm and a former official of the 
investment banking giant drexel burnham lambert inc were charged in 
august with racketeering conspiracy mail and wire fraud for an 
alleged tax scam 
the case marked the first time federal racketeering laws were 
used against officials of a securities firm no charges were leveled 
against the firm itself which was headquartered in princeton nj 
and newport beach calif 
drexel has since reached an agreement with prosecutors to plead 
guilty to six felony counts and pay a record 650 million in fines 
and penalties 
princetonnewport announced it was liquidating last month 
blaming the indictment as well as the publiclypromised but 
longdelayed superseding indictment for spooking many of the 
firms investors into withdrawing their capital 
a week after the original august indictment which accused the 
six defendants of engaging in a racketeering conspiracy to create 
illegal tax losses through phony stock deals it was disclosed that 
prosecutors planned an updated indictment which could include new 
charges of defendants 
but the government pushed the date back to november and then 
january without disclosing details in october the partners posted a 
14 million bond because alleged illegal profits are subject to 
seizure upon conviction under the federal racketeering laws 
no new defendants were added by the superseding indictment 
specifically the new indictment charged that the six engaged in 
additional acts of racketeering mail and wire fraud committed 
securities fraud in connection with public offerings by drexel and 
previously uncharged tax law violations 
the defendants were identified as james sutton reagan 46 of 
pennington nj one of princetonnewports two managing general 
partners jack z rabinowitz 42 head of the firms financial and 
accounting operations charles m zarezcki 40 princetonnewports 
chief trader and paul a berkman 42 chief trader for a 
princetonnewport subsidiary rabinowitz zarezcki and berkman all 
are from princeton nj 
also princetonnewports comptroller steven b smotrich 33 of 
belle meade nj and bruce lee newberg 31 who worked in drexels 
highyield bond department based in beverly hills calif until 
early 1988 
all six previously were charged with one count each of 
racketeering and conspiracy for alleged schemes to create bogus tax 
gains and losses through sham securities sales between 
princetonnewport and drexel and other phony sales from drexel to 
princetonnewport to avoid regulatory requirements and stock 
manipulation 
all were charged additionally with numerous counts of signing or 
aiding and abetting false tax returns for the partnership in 
19841986 
all six face maximum penalties of 20 years in prison and 250000 
in fines if convicted of racketeering and racketeering conspiracy
