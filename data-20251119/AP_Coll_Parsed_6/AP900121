a un delegation arrived in tehran 
sunday to begin the first outside investigation into alleged human 
rights abuses since the 1979 islamic revolution 
the delegations trip marks a significant breakthrough for human 
rights campaigners who have long accused iran of abuses thousands 
of people reportedly have been executed since 1979 
irans official islamic republic news agency monitored in 
nicosia said the un team was scheduled to meet several senior 
iranian officials but did not identify them 
the mission is led by reynaldo galindo pohl the un human 
rights commissions special envoy and an international law expert 
from el salvador 
the un investigation comes amid efforts by president hashemi 
rafsanjani leader of irans socalled pragmatists to liberalize 
society after a decade of rigid moslem fundamentalism 
rafsanjani was elected july 28 he since has dumped prominent 
radicals from senior government posts as part of his effort to 
renew ties with the west and attract badly needed foreign 
investment to revitalize irans moribund economy 
shortly after the un team arrived tehran radio reported that 
the chief of irans judiciary ayatollah mohammad yazdi told a 
meeting of prison directors in tehran that all inmates must be 
treated with respect and in accordance to islamic law 
it is not known how many people are behind bars in iran 
dissident groups claim thousands of political prisoners are held 
without trial languishing in appalling conditions and subjected to 
torture 
tehran invited galindo pohl to visit iran in november ending a 
longtime policy of barring foreign observers from checking its 
human rights practices 
the invitation was extended after galindo pohl produced an 
interim report based mainly on evidence from iranian dissidents 
that abuses continued after irans revolutionary leader ayatollah 
ruhollah khomeini died june 3 
that report cited 1700 people possibly executed and said 
prisoners were flogged whipped on the soles of their feet with 
barbed wire burned with cigarettes sexually abused locked up in 
heated boxes and subjected to mock executions 
amnesty international the londonbased human rights 
organization said in its 1989 report that iran executed more than 
1200 political prisoners between july 1988 and december 1988 
the english language tehran times daily which usually reflects 
rafsanjanis thinking said jan 17 that the un missions visit 
was the best way to neutralize baseless propaganda by the western 
media and enemies of the islamic revolution 
galindo pohl will submit a report on his findings to the human 
rights commissions annual sixweek session in geneva that is to 
begin jan 29 
nearly 1000 people reportedly have been executed since december 
1988 iran responded to criticism of those executions by saying 
that nearly all involved drug traffickers convicted by islamic 
courts iranian opposition groups said many were political 
prisoners however

the air traffic controller who was in charge of 
two planes involved in a fatal runway crash last week was stripped 
of his certification a federal investigator said sunday 
the controller failed to warn the pilot of an eastern airlines 
boeing 727 that had just landed that there was a smaller plane on 
the runway in front of him said the official from the national 
transportation safety board 
the pilot of the smaller plane a twinengine beechcraft king 
air was killed in the accident thursday night at hartsfield 
atlanta international airport the copilot of the beechcraft was 
slightly injured but nobody aboard the airliner was hurt 
the pilot of the eastern plane which carried 141 passengers 
spotted the smaller plane too late and tried to veer away but the 
airliners right wing struck the smaller planes cockpit 
safety board investigators were told the faa had decertified the 
controller due to an error made because procedures were not 
followed the ntsb said in a news release sunday under the name of 
chief investigator bob macintosh 
macintosh refused to answer questions 
the controller whose name was withheld may apply for 
retraining and recertification but wont be allowed to direct air 
traffic without certification 
the controller was hired by the faa in 1982 and has worked in 
the atlanta tower since october 1988 the ntsb said he took his 
post about four minutes before the accident 
ntsb investigators said saturday the pilot of eastern flight 111 
from new york wasnt warned of the smaller plane on the runway 
ahead of him as is required 
during a 2hour interview with ntsb investigators sunday the 
controller acknowledged it was his responsibility to ensure the 
runway was clear before allowing another plane to land the ntsb 
statement said 
he stated that he thought that the king air had cleared the 
runway and was surprised that it had not the statement said 
however he did not actually observe the king air clear the 
runway he could not explain why he did not offer traffic 
information to eastern 111 about the king air flight as required by 
air traffic control procedures 
the controller also indicated that he was distracted by two 
other aircraft one that had just landed and another on landing 
approach that had reported a possible hydraulic problem the 
statement said 
the eastern pilot 23year veteran ralph orlando blamed the 
crash on the controller 
we should have been advised at a minimum that there was a 
small plane and that it might not be cleared orlando said 
apparently no one in the tower saw the collision macintosh said 
the pilot who was killed eric thomas 30 worked for 
atlantabased epps air service

investigators are concluding the bush 
administration exaggerated ousted panamanian dictator manuel 
antonio noriegas wealth the miami herald reported sunday 
many of the assets cited by the administration as evidence of 
noriegas fortune belonged to panamas defense forces or are 
registered to businessmen close to him according to documents 
emerging from panamanian government offices in the aftermath of the 
dec 20 us invasion 
a case in point the herald said was the us state department 
allegation that noriega owned a boeing 727 jet three lear jets and 
three luxury boats named macho i macho ii and macho iii 
documents found in recent weeks suggest that none of those 
planes and boats may be traceable to noreiga unidentified 
officials of the usinstalled panamanian government with access 
to the seized records told the newspaper 
that could complicate efforts by prosecutors to portray noriega 
as an immensely wealthy man in the former generals upcoming 
federsal trial on drug charges in miami 
noriega is accused of making millions in protection payments 
from colombian drug traffickers who used panama to fly drugs to the 
united states 
the boeing 727 purchased in 1983 for 22 million was first 
acquired by the staterun air panama airline and later transferred 
to panamas defense forces air traffic authorities said 
of the three executive jets a lear 35 that was regularly used 
by noriega was rented by panamas defense forces to a miami company 
for 230000 a month officials said a second lear jet appears to 
be partly owned by carlos duque a businessmanpoltician who made 
millions from his association with the former dictator officials 
said they dont know of a third lear jet used by noriega 
the macho i and macho ii were owned by carlos wittgreen another 
businessman who profited greatly from his friendship with noriega 
documents show no records on the third boat have been found 
noriega loyalists said the general used the military aircraft in 
his capacity as defense forces commander the boats were simply 
lent to him by his best friends they said 
all these properties cited by the us government exist but 
were not his said mario rognoni a former commerce minister with 
the noriega regime its like saying that camp david belongs to 
president bush 
officials of the new civilian government counter that there is 
widespread evidence that noriega amassed a significant fortune 
after taking over the defense forces in 1983 
but officials privately concede that the us government may 
have liberally mixed fact with fiction in its efforts to convince 
the world about noriegas crimes the herald said the state 
departments contention that noriegas personal wealth was at least 
200 to 300 million will be hard to prove investigators said

the anticommunist revolutions in eastern 
europe have yielded a bonanza for israel in renewed diplomatic ties 
and the israelis hope it also means the end of training and weapons 
support for arab radicals 
new openings toward israel by countries that once firmly backed 
the arab cause ends a twodecade sovietbloc boycott of the jewish 
state imposed by moscow after the 1967 middle east war 
on sunday vice premier shimon peres became the highest ranking 
israeli since 1967 to visit czechoslovakia 
we are now opening a new page in our relations with eastern 
europe said yossi benaharon a top aide to prime minister 
yitzhak shamir 
foreign minister gyula horn of hungary who recently visited 
jerusalem described the changes as irreversible 
the old order cannot be restored the jerusalem post quoted 
him as saying in an interview 
but it remains unclear whether the renewal of ties will 
translate into longterm diplomatic support for israel in the 
middle east conflict 
horn indicated hungary was more interested in flourishing 
economic ties than the middle east conflict however he said he 
supported an international middle east peace conference a proposal 
accepted by the arabs but staunchly rejected by shamir 
the eastern europe of today is not as propalestinian as 
before but if israel continues its hard line toward the 
palestinians we cannot expect to win the support of these 
countries said moshe zimmermann a historian at the hebrew 
university of jerusalem 
palestinian analysts meanwhile acknowledged the palestine 
liberation organization suffered a diplomatic setback in eastern 
europe because of its association with the overthrown communist 
dictators they said the plo faced an uphill struggle to win the 
support of the new leadership 
the atmosphere is to a certain extent hostile to the 
palestinians said ghassan katib a prominent palestinian 
communist and west bank university lecturer we must establish a 
dialogue with the these new forces 
antiarab sentiment is especially strong in romania where arabs 
were identified in revolutionary quarters as fighting in the ranks 
of the hated securitate secret police who sought to crush the 
popular uprising against dictator nicolae ceausescu 
in the meantime the new eastern european leaders are knocking 
on israels door to renew ties cut in 1967 in september hungary 
became the first poland and czechoslovakia are expected to follow 
this spring romania never severed ties although it supported and 
trained arab guerrillas 
israel never had relations with east germany but a senior 
israeli official said such ties were expected if as seems likely 
the east germans drop their refusal to accept moral responsibility 
for the holocaust 
in light of east germanys economic problems israel would be 
satisfied with a token payment of reparations the official said 
eastern european leaders are mainly driven by the need to rescue 
their crippled economies and israel a close ally of the united 
states is seen as an important mediator 
they believe israel can pave the way for improved economic 
relations with the western world said mark heller an analyst at 
tel aviv universitys jaffee center for strategic studies 
but israel is also seen as an economic partner in its own right 
israeli exports to eastern europe and the soviet union jumped to 
100 million last year up 70 percent from 1988 
the new eastern european leaders whose political survival 
depends in part on their ability to end food shortages at home are 
especially interested in israels agricultural knowhow 
in december the governmentowned israeli company agridev signed 
a cooperation agreement with bulgaria under which israel will 
provide experts and equipment to run bulgarian farms a similar 
agreement is expected to be signed with poland 
in the past year many doors have been opened due to the 
changes in the political situation and the desire to supply enough 
food said amram olmert managing director of agridev 
in addition to the diplomatic and economic windfalls israeli 
officials cite a third beneficial development an end to state 
sponsorship of palestinian terror squads 
in the past the plo and other palestinian groups maintained 
close ties with eastern europe especially romania czechoslovakia 
and east germany which trained and armed hundreds of palestinian 
guerrillas according to israeli intelligence sources 
these countries provided training weapons served as host 
facilities for terrorist organizations and sometimes provided 
sabotage materials said heller 
israeli intelligence officials noted that eastern european 
support for palestinian guerrilla groups has considerably dropped 
in the past year a trend they expected to continue 
i wouldnt be surprised if that activity stopped completely 
heller said

mayor marion barry acknowledging that he 
needs to heal my body mind and soul but declining to mention 
drug abuse announced sunday that he will seek help following his 
arrest on a cocaine possession charge 
he has reached the hour of reckoning said his wife effi 
at times blinking back tears the mayor provided no further 
details on what kind of assistance he will seek except to say that 
social activist and selfdescribed nutritional expert dick gregory 
has been consulting him on how to get help an aide said barrys 
main problem was with alcoholism 
top advisers to the mayor speaking on condition of anonymity 
said the mayor was considering checking into the betty ford clinic 
in rancho mirage calif and two unnamed clinics in the washington 
area 
later sunday one of barrys top political advisers said the 
mayor planned to enter a 30day inpatient treatment program and 
could leave as early as monday the aide who also asked not to be 
identified did not know where the facility was located but said 
it was not in washington 
the washington post quoted unnamed sources in mondays editions 
as saying that while barry had initially decided to seek treatment 
at the betty ford center he now is leaning toward an alternative 
program with gregory 
in another development the post said some of barrys longtime 
political allies are starting to engage in behindthescenes moves 
to shift their alliances to jesse jackson rather than incur their 
own loss of influence in the event barrys poltical career is over 
barrys brief statement was the latest chapter in an unfolding 
drama that has riveted the nations capital since the mayor was 
arrested on drug charges last thursday night 
while the mayor did not say whether he is suffering from drug 
abuse others did 
herbert o reid sr one of the mayors closest personal 
advisors said he hoped that from barrys travails we can all 
learn something about drug addiction 
hes doing the right thing reid said i am we all are 
relieved because many of us have suspected for some time that he 
has had a problem 
the most serious problem is alcoholism barry spokeswoman 
lurma rackley said the mayor has acknowledged that he has a 
health concern and the details are his private matter 
for you to admit that you have a problem that you need to 
make yourself whole again is truly a burden lifted from our 
souls the mayors wife said in remarks that followed her 
husbands for our family it is just the beginning 
barry surrounded by clergy in a broadcast appearance in front 
of st timothys episcopal church near his home clasped his wifes 
hand and said he has come face to face with my deepest human 
failures 
barry said these ministers have helped me to keep the 
strength i need im going to find a way to heal my body mind 
and soul 
the mayor did not take questions and turned the podium to mrs 
barry following his brief statement attention has been focused on 
mrs barry in part because the mayor was lured to his arrest by a 
woman with whom the mayor has been friendly 
barry 53 was arrested thursday evening at a downtown hotel in 
an fbi sting operation he now faces a misdemeanor cocaine 
possession charge after testing positive for cocaine in blood and 
urine tests administered following his arrest 
close advisors to barry told the associated press on saturday 
that the mayor has agreed to enter a drug treatment center the 
sources said details on the type of treatment and location of the 
facility were still being worked out 
barry had been poised to announce his bid for a fourth term as 
mayor on sunday but his arrest has thrown local politics into 
convulsions several advisers said barry had agreed to abandon his 
bid for reelection and they added that the possibility of his 
resigning from office was never discussed in friday and saturday 
strategy sessions 
the issue never came up because it is so far out there beyond 
what we are dealing with now said one aide who spoke with barry 
several times on saturday there is no reason for him to resign 
because if he did he would lose the powers of office the 
influence and the ability to generate money for his treatment 
program and his legal defense 
one barry cabinet member suggested that prior grand jury 
testimony in which the mayor has said he denied ever using drugs 
prevented the mayor from making specific references to drug abuse 
in his short announcement sunday 
if he had said he had a cocaine problem or some other form of 
drug abuse then he could possibly face a perjury charge said 
the aide who spoke only on condition of anonymity he had to be 
careful 
the mayor is now faced with a quandary about whether to 
permanently stay in office because law enforcement officials have 
said that us attorney jay b stephens will not drop the charges 
against the mayor unless he steps down 
stephens has not commented on that issue directly but he has 
suggested he would look favorably on barrys resigning when 
deciding how to proceed with other broader probes of the mayors 
activities 
during their morning appearance barry frequently turned to his 
wife who stood by his side grabbed her hand and squeezed it with 
a wan smile on her face ms barry then patted her husbands hand 
in a comforting way and whispered to him 
in her remarks mrs barry said i thank god for this day that 
he has given marion barry the strength to admit to this whole 
world that as a mortal being he has reached the hour of reckoning 
for he realizes that it is truly in gods hands 
we christopher their son and i will be with you every step 
of the way 
barry said the events of the past several days had been more 
difficult than fighting my way out of poverty or struggling in 
the civil rights movement because i spent so much time doing for 
others that i have not worried enough about caring for myself 
i realize im going to have to walk this journey by myself 
said barry 
when the short event was over barry slowly walked across the 
street to his home staring straight ahead and ignoring the 
questions from a sea of reporters trailing him 
but when one bystander shouted hang in there mr barry youve 
been a great mayor barry flashed a broad grin and waved a 
campaigners wave for a moment before his smile disappeared and his 
arm fell limply to his side

the late us supreme court justice abe fortas 
violated court confidentiality in 1966 by leaking information to 
president johnson a history professor said citing newly released 
fbi records 
the alleged leaks about court deliberations to the white house 
and the fbi involved information that might discredit robert f 
kennedy a former attorney general and political rival of johnson 
the documents released to marquette university history 
professor athan theoharis under the freedom of information act 
were outlined in the milwaukee journal on sunday 
fbi files say fortas who died in 1982 was cautioned by the 
agency he would violate judicial ethics by reporting on private 
discussions among the courts justices the paper said 
the records show fortas johnson and white house aides saw an 
opportunity to associate kennedy with an illegal eavesdropping 
incident that occurred while he was attorney general in 1963 the 
paper said fortas discussed the case with the white house 
it raises real questions about fortas role on the court and 
the degree with which he identified with the partisan interests and 
antikennedy forces in the johnson administration theoharis 
author of a 1988 book on fbi director j edgar hoover told the 
paper 
fortas resigned from the court in 1969 during an unrelated 
ethics matter hoover died in 1972 and johnson in 1973 
theoharis said the files show fortas violated the constitutions 
doctrine of separation of court and executive power by agreeing to 
provide inside information to fbi assistant director cd de loach 
he should have thrown de loach out on his ear theoharis 
said 
de loach now retired told the journal in a telephone interview 
from hilton head island sc that he could recall nothing of the 
case discussed in the files 
the case involved bugging of a hotel room occupied by fred 
black a washington dc lobbyist who was appealing a fraud 
conviction to the high court 
solicitor general thurgood marshall disclosed the the bugging 
a memo written by hoover june 14 1966 said fortas called 
marshall dumb marshall now sits on the supreme court 
the court suspended deliberations in the black case and asked 
attorney general nicholas katzenbach if the fbi bugging was 
authorized because kennedy was attorney general at the time of the 
bugging there appeared an opportunity to discredit him the 
newspaper said 
a memorandum by de loach quoted fortas as saying the entire 
matter boiled down to a continuing fight for the presidency 
fortas volunteered to talk on a confidential basis at any time 
it said 
the theoharis documents show fortas told de loach the justices 
held a confidential meeting among themselves and decided to 
review fbi records before ruling on the black appeal 
fortas suggested a plan to de loach to protect the president 
and the fbi by appointing a projohnson arbitrator to review fbi 
eavesdropping policy bypassing katzenbach the documents said 
fortas telephoned de loach june 21 to say johnson was appointing 
a threemember eavesdropping investigation panel johnson changed 
his mind two days later a de loach memo said 
the justice department said in july 1966 that hoover authorized 
the bugging under authority delegated by one or more of kennedys 
predecessors as attorney general 
in november the supreme court ordered a new trial for black 
calling the bugging illegal black was subsequently acquitted 
katzenbach interviewed by telephone in new jersey said the 
documents disclosures surprised him 
you think you know whats going on and you dont katzenbach 
said 
scott anderson a coauthor of the 1979 investigative book the 
brethen about the high court said the documents seem to show an 
unprecedented breach of supreme court tradition and procedure 
this screams impropriety said geoffrey miller a university 
of chicago law professor codes of ethics forbid judges from 
discussing judicial deliberations outside a courtroom he said 
its disgraceful said harvard law school professor charles 
fried

soviet soldiers waged fierce street battles with 
militants saturday in the southern republic of azerbaijan and at 
least 57 people were killed the government said witnesses said 
the death toll could be far higher 
the street is covered with blood vadim korsh an editor of 
azerbaijans official news agency azerinform said of the scene at 
a military garrison in the capital baku 
one activist said more than 100 local troops at the garrison 
joined the militants in fighting soviet soldiers thousands of 
which were sent to quell a week of ethnic and separatist violence 
it was the first report of rebellion in local ranks 
by evening residents were reporting that the sound of gunfire 
had stopped in the barracks and elsewhere in the city center 
early sunday moscow radio said soviet forces were in control of 
the city though some gunfire could still be heard the report 
quoted by the british broadcasting corp said the first night of a 
curfew passed in relative calm with 18 people arrested for 
violating the curfew 
azerbaijani president elmira kafarova on saturday denounced the 
gross violation of the republics sovereignty by the kremlins 
declaration of a state of emergency without the approval of local 
authorities 
the people of azerbaijan will never forgive anyone for the 
tragic way their sons and daughters have been killed she said 
in moscow president mikhail s gorbachev went on nationwide tv 
to appeal for an end to the violence that the government says has 
killed more than 129 people wounded 500 and chased thousands of 
armenians from their homes 
in the last two years the central authorities have sought to 
act in a patient and thoughtful manner trying to solve difficult 
problems exclusively by peaceful political means gorbachev said 
but militants had begun threatening to take over the government 
by force and are killing people he said 
this had to stop said gorbachev who also has had to deal 
with nationalist movements in other republics including 
neighboring georgia moldavia and the baltics 
in washington the bush administration called for restraint in 
the use of force and said the sending of troops to stop the 
violence should not become a cloak for the abridgment of the 
exercise of political rights 
iran which borders azerbaijan urged the soviet government to 
resolve the issue by employing peaceful means 
moscow sent troops to baku after fighting flared between the 
moslem azerbaijanis and mainly christian armenians the neighboring 
republics are locked in a decadesold dispute over the region of 
nagornokarabakh which is inside azerbaijan but populated mainly 
by armenians 
speakers at rallies in baku were reported to have demanded 
secession from the soviet union and unification with iran 
some 5000 regular army troops and thousands more interior 
ministry soldiers and police have moved in to try to restore order 
araz alizade of the opposition azerbaijani social democratic 
group said 120 azeribaijani soldiers under the command of a 
colonel spent the afternoon in a pitched battle with soviet troops 
in the salyanovsky barracks in downtown baku 
by evening the shooting stopped he said in a telephone 
interview from the city but he had no further details 
the official tass news agency quoted deputy defense ministry 
gen valentin varennikov as saying militants surrounded the 
barracks and that troops who moved in to defend it were attacked by 
snipers firing heavycaliber machine guns from rooftops 
the soldiers opened warning fire only in defense of strategic 
sites and their own lives if the attacks didnt stop they fired 
only on those who were threatening them he said 
the interior ministry reported 51 civilians and six soldiers 
dead saturday it said 287 civilians and 36 soldiers were wounded 
korsh said in a telephone interview from baku that corpses were 
strewn on the road to the citys airport 
it was impossible to independently verify government casualty 
figures as foreign reporters have been barred from the region 
azerbaijani activists claimed the number of dead climbed into 
the thousands after armored personnel carriers surrounded a central 
square in baku and opened fire with machine guns 
but arif yunosof of the azerbaijani social democratic group said 
the troops fired into the air in a vain attempt to dispel the crowd 
of 30000 to 40000 people 
troops moved into baku a caspian sea port of 18 million 
people early saturday army and internal security troops have been 
building up in armenia and azerbaijan for several days but they 
previously had not entered baku 
soldiers surrounded a square near the communist party 
headquarters where about 30000 azerbaijanis gathered in an 
antigovernment protest said leila unusova also of the 
azerbaijani social democrat group 
the biggest battles reportedly raged around the airport and 
military garrison where armed protesters had been trying to 
prevent troop reinforcements from traveling to the strifetorn 
areas 
the azerbaijan communist party chief abdulrakhman vezirov was 
fired and replaced by two people azerbaijan premier ayaz mutalibov 
and party second secretary viktor polyanichko tass reported 
censorship was in full force as part of the state of emergency 
tass had photographs of soldiers fighting civilians but editors 
said they were not permitted to release them 
radio moscow said the measure forbids strikes and street 
processions the use of duplicating equipment and the use of 
transport without special permission the first deputy foreign 
minister alexander bessmertnykh told reporters the measures and 
introduction of troops had improved the situation 
but the reports of mass rallies and the continued sound of 
gunshots ringing out in the capital indicated otherwise 
adding to the problems were daring political moves by 
azerbaijanis 
the legislature of the nakhichevan autonomous republic which is 
controlled by the republic voted to secede from azerbaijan as well 
as from the ussr news reports said 
nakhichevan is a small enclave of about 250000 people

when american adventurer william 
walker set fire to this handsome colonial city in 1856 the 
citizens are said to have hidden their gold in holes in the ground 
or in thick adobe walls 
among the remnants of that episode is the granadinos tendency 
to tap on walls hoping for a hollow sound and the memory of the 
us invader who stuck a sign in the smoldering ruins with a 
cynical message here was granada 
when he came here for a campaign rally president daniel ortega 
seized on that 133yearold memory to drive home one of the 
sandinistas messages they represent the defense of national 
sovereignty in the face of us intervention 
times havent changed that much ortega told some 6000 
granadinos who recently gathered at the central park for a rally 
the yankees are still trying 
in one campaign appearance after another ortega plays the 
sandinistas top drawing cards patriotism patronage and 
packaging he is taking aim at two important blocs as he tries for 
another sixyear term in the feb 25 elections women and youth 
this is a young country the young people are the future they 
are our future said one sandinista militant whose job is to 
observe rallies 
the voting age in nicaragua is 16 and an estimated 46 percent 
of nicaraguans are under 15 years of age 
women especially those in the 1635 age bracket are also an 
important bloc they normally are 51 percent of the population but 
are an even greater percentage now more than 12 years of armed 
conflict has killed thousands of men and left others refugees or 
members of the contra army ranks 
early in the campaign ortega a younglooking 44 was 
repackaged to create a new image 
daniel president of the young proclaim posters billboards 
and grafitti many of them around university campuses and schools 
the president traded his prescription glasses for contact 
lenses he switched from his sober trademark camouflage uniform to 
black tshirts worn under cotton bomber jackets with sleeves rolled 
up he started wearing cowboy boots 
in december ortega started dancing with skimpily clad beauty 
queens 
in granada he danced on stage with marucha a barefoot and 
aproned food vendor known for her chancho con yuca a favorite 
nicaraguan dish of fried pork rinds with yucca the crowd was 
delighted 
a regular feature at sandinista rallies is a session where 
ortega poses with children for photographs 
dourfaced state security agents lean down from the 7foothigh 
speaking platform to pick up tiny babies whose parents want to go 
home with an instant picture of junior and the president 
like most rallies the granada rally was followed by a ceremony 
honoring relatives of war victims 
this time it was a dinner at granadas best hotel for members of 
the mothers of heroes and martyrs a sandinista organization with 
few nicaraguan families untouched by the war between the 
sandinistas and the usbacked contra rebels and with most people 
unable to afford restaurants the gesture will likely be remembered 
josefa salinas the 22yearold daughter of a poor peasant 
family waited in a broiling sun then a downpour for ortega to 
appear 
ms salinas from the nearby community of el capulin graduated 
in december from a granada technical school with a degree in 
accounting 
before i would not have been able to study before you had 
to pay now its free she said 
ms salinas was 12 years old when the sandinistas came to power 
in july 1979 and ousted dictator anastasio somoza 
the irony is that while the sandinistas have made it possible 
for a poor peasant child such as ms salinas to obtain an 
education now that she has it she cant find work unemployment 
among nicaraguan youth is widespread and unabating 
im looking but there doesnt seem to be any work she said 
however her vote will be 100 percent totally for the 
sandinista front 
why 
its the way they are carrying out the revolutionary process 
how they treat the people she said before with the 
somocistas the government would deal only with the rich people and 
the gringos just among themselves now we are taken into account 
ms salinas father was an itinerant peasant who rented his 
labor to large landowners under somoza the sandinista government 
gave him land through agrarian reform and he now works in a farm 
cooperative 
the sandinistas have exercised their patronage as the ruling 
party and handed out hundreds of land and home titles to nicaraguan 
families theyve given taxi cooperatives easy credit to buy new 
cars government workers have obtained pay raises 
party pins and other symbols of recognition have been 
distributed like candy as have tshirts baseball caps tote bags 
belt buckles kerchiefs pens cigarette lighters and posters 
the sandinista youth an organization for men and women roughly 
between ages 15 and 30 harnesses that force for party purposes 
the government sponsors popular dances with local and foreign bands 
and promotes sports belonging to it means preferential treatment 
in obtaining scholarships and other advantages 
high school student marta lorena mendoza 18 said she joined 
the sandinista youth four days before the rally and had been sent 
out everyday to hand out leaflets announcing ortegas arrival 
everybody in the neighborhood belongs to the sandinista 
youth she said my cousin an older boy who is in the 
sandinista army told me i should join

the top opposition 
presidential candidate jumped back onto the campaign trail over the 
weekend after knee surgery dismissing government suggestions she 
may withdraw from the race 
violeta barrios de chamorro of the united national opposition 
or uno pledged peace and prosperity during a speech to supporters 
saturday in the southern town of san rafael del sur she said her 
coalition would ban the draft if it wins general elections feb 25 
she is challenging president daniel ortega who is seeking 
another sixyear term 
mrs chamorro 60 wore a cast on her left leg and sat in a 
wheelchair as she spoke from the back of a pickup truck in this 
town an opposition stronghold about 3000 people gathered to hear 
mrs chamorro and other uno candidates 
uno leaders say they have received little of the 9 million 
appropriated for nicaragua in october by the us congress about 
2 million is meant as direct aid to uno and the rest is to support 
the general electoral process 
while the ruling leftist sandinista front has handed out 
thousands of tshirts pins pens cigarette lighters baseball 
caps tote bags and other such items most uno slogans appear as 
graffiti scrawled on walls 
now they sandinistas are distributing little gifts to buy 
votes mrs chamorro told the crowd 
i say take the tshirt put a little bleach on it take 
daniels name off and put your own name on it if you want she 
told a cheering crowd 
clothing even a tshirt is expensive for most nicaraguans 
as if the country could forget 10 years of war because of a 
tshirt mrs chamorro said referring to the civil war between 
the leftist government and usbacked contra rebels 
the widow of revered civic leader pedro joaquin chamorro and 
the publisher of la prensa nicaraguas only opposition newspaper 
mrs chamorro received the backing of 14 parties ranging from 
conservatives to communists that united to form an 
antisandinista bloc 
mrs chamorro suffers from osteoporosis an illness that makes 
bones brittle and she fractured her knee when she fell at home 
dec 31 
she underwent surgery at a houston clinic where president bush 
telephoned twice to inquire about her health she returned last 
week to nicaragua 
ortega has suggested repeatedly that uno might withdraw from the 
elections label them a fraud and invite a us invasion like the 
one last month in panama mrs chamorro and running mate virgilio 
godoy of the independent liberal party have repeatedly denied plans 
to withdraw 
mrs chamorro assured the crowd that i take a pill for the 
pain and will keep campaigning 
polls have shown that voters top concerns are ending the 
twoyear draft obligatory for 16yearold boys ending the civil 
war and reviving a moribund economy 
since the us invasion of panama the sandinistas have said 
they expect nicaragua to be the next target of an invasion but the 
state department has dismissed such talk 
mrs chamorro said saturday she was allergic to weapons and 
derided ortegas claims of wanting peace while keeping the largest 
armed forces by far in central america 
they are estimated at about 150000 members including militias 
and reserves 
with your vote you can say goodbye to the obligatory military 
service draft and to inflation forever she said 
hyperinflation of 36000 percent for 1988 was brought down to 
1600 percent last year after the government put into effect an 
austerity program according to government figures however some 
economists believe the inflation rate is actually higher

the energy department improperly used private 
contractors to write congressional testimony for energy secretary 
james d watkins and to review security clearances the general 
accounting office said sunday 
the gao an arm of the congress that acts as the governments 
auditor also ruled that the environmental protection agency 
improperly used a contractor to run a telephone hotline to answer 
questions from the public about the agencys superfund program of 
cleaning up the worst hazardous waste sites 
the contracts in these three cases should be modified or 
terminated the gao said to ensure that these inherently 
governmental functions are not performed by contractors 
the gaos decision is confirmation that something has gone 
very wrong when government officials are no more than mouthpieces 
or rubber stamps for testimony rules and decisions prepared by 
private contractors said sen david pryor dark who had asked 
gao to review the contracts 
pryor is chairman of the federal services subcommittee of the 
governmental affairs committee and a longtime critic of federal 
agencies reliance on contractors 
epa spokeswoman robin woods said the agency planned to retain 
the contract 
we have made a decision to use our limited resources in areas 
which must be addressed by civil servants such as in the 
development of regulations and policies while contracting out for 
technical information services ms woods said 
at the energy department spokeswoman catherine kaliniak said 
the department would not comment until it had reviewed the 
auditors decision 
the energy department has come under increasing criticism by 
congress for its heavy reliance on contractors the department has 
about 16000 federal workers and more than 100000 contract 
employees watkins has complained publicly that his agency does not 
have enough money to hire federal workers to perform the scientific 
and other technical work that currently is done by contractors 
pryors subcommittee disclosed last november that employees of 
the contractor systematic management services and those of one of 
its subcontractors bdm corp had written the testimony that 
watkins gave before the house armed services committee on april 3 
1989 on the nuclear weapons complex 
the gao said that in addition to writing watkins testimony 
systematic management services also prepared answers to 
congressional inquiries resulting from watkins confirmation 
hearing last february and prepared briefing books and other 
materials for watkins for congressional hearings 
although the gao decision made no mention of it pryors 
subcommittee has charged also that contractors prepared testimony 
for other senior energy department officials including leo duffy 
watkins chief adviser on waste management 
the gao said the department has admitted that this use of 
contractors violated the departments own rules more broadly the 
auditors said the preparation of congressional testimony is 
government work that should be done only by federal employees 
the gao also said the energy department was wrong to hire maxima 
corp of bethesda md to hear evidence in security clearance 
cases hearing officers provided by maxima do not grant clearances 
but they make recommendations to department managers on granting 
denying or revoking clearances the auditors said 
maxima employees also serve as examiners who hear appeals of 
security clearance decisions 
this contract also calls for maxima to do psychiatric 
evaluations of security clearance applicants according to 
department records made available to the associated press it also 
is to audit computerized files of personnel security information on 
240000 individuals and correct inaccuracies in the files 
the department asserted to the gao that the maxima contract was 
proper because the hearing officers and examiners do not make final 
decisions on security clearances the auditors ruled however that 
these are quasijudicial services which are inherently 
governmental functions that should not be procured by contract 
last july the energy department revealed in a classified 
hearing of the house energy and commerce investigations 
subcommittee that contract employees were used to conduct 
interviews of applicants for the highest level security clearances 
at nuclear arms plants it said this was done because there were 
not enough federal staffers available even though it violates 
written department policy a sanitized transcript of that hearing 
was released last month 
in the epa case reviewed by the gao the auditors said 
georesource consultants inc of san francisco has been on the 
agencys payroll since 1980 to operate the superfund hotline the 
auditors said this arrangement raises questions concerning the 
amount of discretion and value judgment used by the contractor in 
answering questions about certain environmental laws 
the epa contends that the hotline contract is proper because the 
contractor is merely a conduit for information and is not 
making decisions for the government gao disagreed saying the 
contract employees in responding to callers questions use their 
own judgment to interpret epa regulations

the tumultuous revolution in romania 
culminating in the execution of dictator nicolae ceausescu sent 
shivers down the spines of the chinese leadership 
of the east european countries that experienced prodemocracy 
movements romania had the best relations with china there also 
were similarities in their relative economic and political 
developments 
but while the romanian people succeeded in their revolution the 
chinese student movement which preceded the changes in bucharest 
and around eastern europe by six months failed 
several critical differences between the two countries helped 
chinas rulers their economy was stronger than romanias their 
troops remained loyal and romanias revolution was watched by the 
benevolent eye of soviet president mikhail s gorbachev while 
chinas students had little but ample air time on western tv 
a fear of chaos in china brought on by nightmarish memories of 
the ultraleftist cultural revolution also helped the beijings 
hardliners 
the question why not china is being pondered not only by 
those who study beijing but by those who run it western and 
chinese sources report meetings are being held weekly and even 
daily among communist party cells government units and the 
military to stress the leaderships view of the romanian revolution 
as an antisocialist uprising much like the 
counterrevolutionary uprising of beijing in the spring of 1989 
after ceausescus execution more troops were rushed to beijing 
to prevent demonstrations one hong kong magazine reports that some 
senior cadres were unable to eat upon hearing of the dictators 
demise 
why did the tumult in timisoara touch such a tender nerve among 
the chinese leadership 
romania had the closest ties with china in eastern europe and 
was in lockstep with the beijing leadership on many issues of 
practical and political importance both countries at early dates 
in their communist history distanced themselves from the soviet 
unions foreign policy both revered the discredited soviet 
dictator josef stalin 
there were reports ceausescu considered seeking refuge in 
beijing as he fell from power 
romanias political structure also closely resembled chinas 
ceausescu was a dictator who placed family members in important 
positions to perpetuate his communist dynasty 
china for most of the past decade has remained in the hands of 
one man deng xiaoping nepotism is rife 
but in june of 1989 the differences between the two countries 
proved critical 
when deng seized power in 1978 he launched a reform program 
that doubled chinas gross national product in a decade gave land 
back to the peasants and sparked a marked increase in the average 
standard of living 
the economic reforms did not come with any concrete political 
changes periods of relative liberalism were followed by crackdowns 
on bourgeois liberalism and spiritual polllution buzzwords 
for democratic yearnings 
but the people were not hungry and their anger during the june 
prodemocracy movement turned quickly to fear the bloodiest part 
of the crackdown lasted a weekend 
in romania meanwhile ceausescu choked his economy in his drive 
to repay foreign debt sparking the most pervasive shortages in 
eastern europe among the people hunger and exasperation with 
another winter without coal oil or electricity led to desperation 
enough that people would risk their lives to complete the 
revolution 
romanias military was not immune to these influences and by 
apparently killing at least one military commander the securitate 
forces alienated themselves from the regular troops a fatal 
mistake 
in china the military remained loyal to the state one reason 
is that china does not have a special security force separate from 
the military and was thus spared the possibilities of such a 
confrontation another is that chinas army was born from a true 
national liberation struggle in the 1920s and has a long history of 
loyalty to the communist party 
despite its economic quagmire romania passed through several 
decades of relative political stability before its revolution in 
the 1960s china suffered the ultraleftist cultural revolution 
during which millions were killed as mao tsetung sought to purge 
his country of bourgeois influences the experience left many 
chinese fearful of mass movements in the minds of many chinese 
the government justified its oppression by evoking fears of the 
chaos of not so long ago 
but now the chinese leadership appears to be sowing the seeds 
for the next round of chaos it is dismantling the very reform 
program that saved it 
leading reformers have been purged smallscale private and 
collectively owned enterprises are being closed throughout the 
country putting millions out of work peasants are again being 
forced to grow grain thereby sacrificing the lucrative vegetable 
market the government has taken to issuing them ious that have no 
deadline for collection workers salaries are effectively being 
cut as the government pays an increasingly high percentage of their 
wages in nonnegotiable bonds 
further blows have been struck by a fall in foreign investments 
one respected hongkong based consultants group recently branded 
china the riskiest investment in asia even worse than the 
philippines which is still reeling from the bloody coup attempt in 
december 
more trouble seems inevitable 
the worry is that the next flurry might not be centered on the 
students who with their marches and hunger strikes made 
nonviolence a way of life 
chinas next round of trouble might come from the countryside or 
the inner cities led by a people schooled in the art of discourse

when congress returns this week lobbyist 
kevin kearney will climb out of his hot tub slip into a 
conservative blue suit and head for capitol hill to give americas 
35000 cardcarrying nudists some national exposure 
we need to come out of the closet says kearney the first 
fulltime lobbyist for the floridabased american sunbathing 
association 
kearney 38 an avid outdoorsman has become an enthusiastic 
convert to clothingoptional recreation since he was hired last 
march by the oldest and biggest nudist organization in the country 
he conducts business from an office in his suburban cabin john 
md home and has installed a telephone in the backyard next to 
his bubbling hot tub where he makes calls while skinnydipping 
its a good place to work he says 
in his battle against government coverups kearney works 
closely with turner v stokes a leesburg va computer specialist 
and longtime nudist who founded nudepac a nudist political action 
committee five years ago 
were mad as hell and we wont take it anymore says 
stokes borrowing from the line made popular by the movie 
network 
kearney already has lobbied the national park service and other 
federal agencies to issue regulations guaranteeing nudists the 
right to enjoy swimming camping hiking whitewater canuding 
and other recreational activities on public lands 
his next targets are the 65 members of house and senate 
committees with jurisdiction over public lands he recently mailed 
each of them a copy of the asas artsy new wall calendar for 1990 
featuring photos of nudes romping in the grand canyon splashing in 
colorado hot springs and scaling snowcovered california mountain 
peaks 
only two legislators responded a california democrat wrote back 
asking for more calendars an iowa republicans envelope came back 
unopened and stamped return to sender 
undaunted kearney is pondering several other gimmicks to 
improve the nudist image among washington power brokers 
hes thinking of inviting every member of congress to a nearby 
maryland nudist camp this summer to shed their inhibitions press 
the flesh and enjoy some barbecue in the buff 
on national nude weekend in midjuly kearney may lead a 
barebottomed sailboat regatta down the potomac river to challenge 
federal state and local antinudity regulations hes also ready 
to propose a federal excise tax on bathing suits which he calls 
a piece of totally useless recreational equipment 
there are no federal laws outlawing nudity spokesmen for the 
national park service the us forest service and the tennessee 
valley authority say nudists generally are welcome on public lands 
unless their activities are forbidden by local statutes or threaten 
to disturb the tranquility of wilderness areas 
but george berklacy a national park service spokesman had 
discouraging news for kearney we have no intention of developing 
regulations which allow for nude sunbathing he said 
kearney complained that without uniform federal regulations 
unsuspecting nudists run the risk of arbitrary eviction by hostile 
park rangers some of whom have threatened their au naturel 
visitors with guns or handcuffs 
our people have lost many beaches over the last decade and 
theyre frustrated and tired of being hassled he said this 
sort of thing would never be allowed to happen to surf casters or 
tennis players or golfers 
kearney is convinced that despite all the prejudice and 
snickering an estimated 40 million americans many of them 
welleducated highly paid professionals have participated in 
nude recreation at some time from neighborhood hot tub parties 
to vacations on yugoslavias famed nude beaches 
all of a sudden americans are going to change their attitudes 
quickly he predicted all they need is a catalyst 
what kind of catalyst its going to happen when people come 
out of the closet he said when you get a president of the 
united states wholl go on television and admit that hes a 
nudist

lee patrick brown who takes office monday as 
new yorks 36th police commissioner has made a career of tackling 
troubled police departments 
nicknamed the iceman he is known as a cool deliberate 
some say stiff administrator who meticulously studies problems 
before acting 
his supporters say the 52yearold brown is a dedicated crime 
fighter prepared to tackle the nations largest city they call him 
a a thinking persons cop who recognizes the importance of fighting 
crime at its roots including trying to correct the social ills 
that foster criminals 
his detractors say he is more a politician than a policeman 
garnering good publicity for the department while the police force 
unravels from within 
when brown became public safety commissioner in atlanta in 1978 
the department was reeling from a series of child murders that 
shocked the nation antidiscrimination lawsuits and a promotion 
examinations scandal in 1982 he was appointed police chief in 
houston a city where the police had a triggerhappy reputation 
by the time he left both cities both police departments had won 
praise and many officials begged him to stay two recent incidents 
in houston in which white or hispanic officers have shot and killed 
black motorists have once again tarnished the departments image 
but brown emerged relatively unscathed just before he left 
houston he fired the officers involved 
his resume is impressive with a phd in criminology and a 
masters degree in sociology hes been a patrolman in san jose 
calif and a professor at portland state and howard universities 
browns past is not without controversy however and he has 
received a cold shoulder from new york police as he prepares to 
take over the nations largest police department 
when new mayor david dinkins tapped brown he was going against 
the wishes of gov mario cuomo former mayor edward i koch and the 
patrolmans benevolent association all supported the retention of 
richard condon who had served as police commissioner since the 
retirement of ben ward in october 
numerous officers have told the press that they resent brown 
winning the job over the popular condon but the patrolmens 
association has taken a waitandsee attitude 
the organizations response certainly has been more restrained 
than that of houston police when he was named as the first black 
chief there they sent truth squads to atlanta to check on 
their new boss 
they were pretty hard on him but we have no reason to do 
that said joseph mancini a spokesman for the new york 
patrolmens association 
richard murray a political pollster at the university of 
houston said brown is very good at public relations the 
popularity of houston police shot up during browns first few years 
hes a phd and that doesnt hurt murray said hes 
worked his way up 
all agree that brown loves criminology jargon and terminology 
sprinkling his conversations with bureaucratic phrases like 
problemsolving analysis and patrolmanagement plans 
hes not exactly a quote machine said jc mosier a 
houston police spokesman 
once when he testified in the trial of wayne williams the man 
convicted in some of the atlanta child murders an exasperated 
defense attorney asked brown if he spoke english 
nor is he a popular guy in the houston police department police 
groups say that brown did what mayor kathy whitmire wanted him to 
do and did little to better the life of the average police officer 
still smarting from the collapse of the domestic oil market 
houston has been unable to afford a police cadet class since 1986 
with attrition shrinking the police force to about 3900 and police 
receiving only minimal pay raises 
when word got out that brown was going to new york some houston 
police officers sang i love new york over police radios 
houston police patrolmens union president mike howard said 
brown has hurt morale here terribly the department has gotten so 
bad the last couple of years and he has done nothing to help 
howard compared him to a magician using mirrors smoke and 
glitter and the department all looks fine but on the inside the 
department is falling apart 
whitmire said the complaints from police groups come mostly from 
the old guard officers who resisted browns modernization efforts 
which include a strong emphasis on minority hiring 
people in new york will find that he can always be counted on 
to be very professional very measured whitmire said lees 
not a person to shoot from the hip or to go with any decision 
without it being well thought out 
brown says he brings no preconceived notions on how to fight 
crime in new york in his calm precise tone he says he unworried 
by the lack of a welcome mat 
once i get there i intend to reach out to them once i get to 
meet the people theyll understand i am a natural at this brown

thousands of azerbaijanis demonstrated sunday to 
protest the governments crackdown on ethnic violence in their 
southern republic and to mourn nationalists who died in the 
fighting 
at the same time armenians congregated at a moscow church and 
cemetery to mourn their dead and collect money and offer housing 
for refugees 
at least 2000 azerbaijanis living in the soviet capital 
gathered at the republics government offices then marched to the 
central headquarters of the official news agency tass where they 
protested its portrayal of the crackdown 
according to tass 51 civilians and six soldiers died in 
clashes in baku the azerbaijan capital on saturday nationalist 
groups in azerbaijan and moscow put the death toll much higher but 
could not substantiate their figures 
the crackdown ordered by president mikhail s gorbachev came 
after years of ethnic tensions and territorial disputes between 
mostly christian armenians and predominantly moslem azerbaijanis in 
the caucasus region 
the azerbaijani demonstrators demanded that the chief editor 
come out of tass headquarters and explain to them why the news 
agency was distorting events in the azerbaijani capital when 
no one emerged the demonstrators moved off toward the studios of 
gostelradio the staterun television and radio 
they are not telling the truth said one of the 
demonstration organizers we are not being told what is really 
happening in baku 
the protesters many wearing black armbands waved azerbaijani 
flags and held up placards blaming the violence in armenia and 
azerbaijan on gorbachev 
the signs said more than 1000 murdered thousands injured 
tragedy in baku reflection of gorbachev politics and who is 
next gorbachev 
gorbachev told a nationwide television audience saturday that 
troops were sent to baku as a last resort after efforts to solve 
the azerbaijaniarmenian conflict peacefully failed 
as the azerbaijanis marched on media offices armenians gathered 
at a church inside the vagankovsky cemetery in western moscow to 
mourn the dozens of armenian victims of the ethnic violence 
they lit candles and listened to an organ playing somber music 
inside the small red brick church outside volunteers sat at a 
table on the snowcovered sidewalk to collect donations for the 
15000 armenian refugees who fled baku 
demonstrators outside the church held protest signs including 
one that blamed moscow for the deaths of armenians killed by 
azerbaijanis in clashes before soviet troops were sent to baku

with a push for new restrictions in 
legislatures around the country opponents of abortion hope to keep 
debate on the issue alive during this election year to the 
discomfort of their republican allies whod like to see it go away 
in 1990 no candidate can run for public office without 
squarely facing the abortion issue republican chairman lee 
atwater told gop officials friday 
then with a little less certainty he added that i would hope 
republicans support republican candidates regardless of their 
position on abortion 
after losing crucial 1989 elections antiabortion leaders were 
trying to regain the offensive by pressing state legislatures to 
impose a variety of limits on womens rights to obtain abortions 
abortionrights leaders say they expect some legislatures will 
pass some restrictions this year but they believe they will 
prevail in most and that the fights will help shape the 1990 
elections for governor state legislatures and other offices 
the two sides in the volatile debate were taking different 
approaches to mondays 17th anniversay of the supreme courts roe 
vs wade decision legalizing abortion 
opponents of that decision were massing for a march on the us 
capitol and planning other demonstrations around the country while 
supporters of abortion were concentrating on lowkey lobbying 
activities 
both sides agree the intensifying battles over abortion will 
dominate many races this year from congress to local offices just 
as in the few elections last fall 
anybody running for anything short of school board is going to 
be put on the spot said charles cook editor of a washington 
political newsletter everybody up and down the line is going to 
have to address it 
republicans have candidates on both sides of the issue but 
under the banner of a party platform that is solidly against 
abortion and a president who has vetoed abortionrights bills from 
congress 
atwater contends the party is big enough to accept different 
views a position many party conservatives dispute 
state your position and move on is the advice michele 
davis director of the republican governors association gives her 
candidates dont allow yourself to be immersed in that one and 
only issue 
the restrictions sought by the national right to life committee 
and other antiabortion groups were made possible by last years 
supreme court ruling that opened the way for new state limits on 
abortion the webster decision revived political intensity over the 
issue and thrust it squarely in the hands of the states 
while the states may be the main arena congress is certain to 
replay the battles it fought on the margins of the abortion debate 
last fall 
for the first time the house joined the senate in voting down 
restrictions on federally financed abortions for poor women in 
cases of rape or incest prompting president bush to issue a 
series of vetos that the prochoice majority could not override 
abortionrights advocates say they will try again later this 
year presenting the prospects of bush vetoes just before the fall 
elections and even righttolife leaders concede polls show a 
majority of public opinion supports allowing abortion in those 
tragic cases 
this cuts against the republicans said rep les aucoin 
dore it did last year will this year i think if theres no 
movement on their side to a more humane approach on this its 
going to cost them dearly at the polls 
abortionrights supporters also plan to keep the political 
debate churning by holding hearings this spring on house and senate 
bills that would incorporate into federal law the roe vs wade 
decision they arent likely to have enough votes to win passage of 
the measure which is aimed at preventing further erosion of 
abortion rights before the supreme court 
the righttolife strategists are basing their hopes for winning 
new state laws on polls showing that in spite of majority support 
for keeping abortions legal there is significant support for some 
limits on abortions when taken on a case by case basis 
for example a national usa today poll taken late last month 
showed 72 percent favored laws requiring notification of parents 
before a minor may obtain an abortion and 63 percent support a 
mandatory 24hour waiting period 
those type of restrictions are among the halfdozen or so bills 
the national right to life committee is pushing though they vary 
in details by states 
anything we can pass will be progress said burke j balch 
state legislative coordinator for the national right to life 
committee well be very happy if we can get one of each of these 
pieces of legislation in one or two states 
other restrictions pushed by the righttolife groups include 
banning abortions for gender selection giving fathers rights to 
block an abortion in court banning abortions in public facilities 
and blocking government counseling on abortions and informed 
consent requirements forcing women to receive information about 
the abortion process and fetal development 
but the most significant restriction would bar abortion as a 
means of birth control a catchall phrase that encompasses 90 
percent or more of all abortions

in both foreign and internal affairs mikhail s 
gorbachev is trying to instill the idea of negotiation and law into 
a country accustomed to the heavyhanded style that filled labor 
camps and unmarked graves and invaded neighboring countries 
only the threat of civil war and secession overcame gorbachevs 
deep reluctance to use force and persuaded him to send troops into 
the azerbaijani capital of baku to stop ethnic fighting between 
azerbaijanis and armenians 
mindful of bloody precedents gorbachev first tried to defuse 
the conflict with decrees discussions and appeals to use common 
sense 
gorbachev said he ordered the military to shoot if necessary 
only when he became convinced he had no alternative 
it could no longer go on a wearylooking gorbachev told the 
nation in a television address saturday 
the state is dutybound to put an end to lawlessness and 
inhumanity to resolutely curb criminal actions of extremists who 
have lost human face who are prepared to take other peoples lives 
for the sake of personal ambition selfish interests and power 
he said 
victims of the conflict as well as the budding political 
opposition openly secondguess him accusing gorbachev of 
aggravating the problem with indecision 
but gorbachev has staked his reforms on convincing the world 
that the soviet union believes consultation is better than 
confrontation internally he is removing moscows heavy hand in 
order to shift more responsibility to local authorities 
in raising the prestige and power of local authorities he has 
assumed that they logically will follow his reform policies and he 
has appeared startled and angry when they have not 
until last week the soviet leader had deployed interior 
ministry soldiers only to guard vital installations in armenia and 
azerbaijan and to end bloody attacks on minority meskhetian turks 
in uzbekistan that left about 100 people dead 
once when he was out of the country violence was used against 
nationalist protesters in the republic of georgia 
gorbachev had ordered the troops disarmed so they went in with 
shovels killing 19 demonstrators the deaths sparked a national 
outcry that was probably partly responsible for the retirement of a 
former kgb chief from the ruling politburo 
writer and historian ales adamovich a progressive member of the 
congress of peoples deputies said gorbachev risks losing respect 
because of his disdain of the use of force 
can you achieve anything in this country with his character 
mentality and psychology without a strong hand he asked in an 
article printed in the moscow news he risks being misunderstood 
or just losing peoples respect altogether remember the people 
had respect for stalin 
isnt there a risk that his personal democratism and 
nonviolence could be regarded as his weakness in a country 
accustomed to a different style of leadership adamovich wrote 
the deputy editor of the moscow news vitaly tretyakov said the 
soviet leader relies so heavily on compromise as a political tool 
that he sometimes blurs the line between what ultimately is 
acceptable and what is not 
armenians and azerbaijanis have bitterly criticized gorbachevs 
handling of the crisis that surrounds their conflicting claims to 
the nagornokarabakh territory 
world chess champion garri kasparov a resident of baku whose 
mother is armenian blamed gorbachevs permissiveness for the 
bloodletting 
everyone can decide for themselves but what can one think of 
a government that has permitted such horrendous events he said 
in an interview with a spanish newspaper after fleeing baku 
another armenian refugee from baku nelya azerburyan 
interviewed in moscow last week said gorbachev never learned 
instead of all this glasnost he should have studied the central 
asian people 
at least one western military observer in moscow agrees that 
gorbachev in the past has not acted forcefully enough 
when you have people shooting at each other and killing each 
other with guns and other hardware you have to disarm them he 
said speaking on condition of anonymity to do that you have to 
kill some of them if hes not willing to do that hes not going 
to stop the fighting 
it seems unlikely that the soviet leader will respond with equal 
force to peaceful demands for independence 
gorbachev last month withstood a barrage of demands from 
conservative critics demanding he take tough action against the 
nonviolent but determined drive by lithuanians to restore the 
independence they lost to stalin in 1940 
the communist party chief argued lithuanian leaders are taking 
their republic down a deadend path he flew there to face them and 
nationalist protesters but he never threatened to use force to 
stop their independence drive

a study by the american farmland trust finds 
that many farmers favor crop methods to protect the environment but 
are highly skeptical of tougher federal restrictions on chemical 
use 
the private nonprofit conservation group said sunday that 
substantial numbers of farmrs across the country are interested 
in and currently employing a variety of environmentally benign 
sustainable agricultural practices 
but the report acknowledged that there are wide variations among 
farmers depending on the kinds of crops involved and on geographic 
locations for example only 20 percent in one area used rotation 
plans while the majority in other areas followed the soilsaving 
practice 
the project was based on personal interviews lasting for more 
than an hour with 489 farmers randomly selected in five major 
production areas in butte county calif whitman county wash 
renville county minn livingston county ill and dooly county 
georgia 
questioners asked about methods used by the farmers in 1988 the 
most recently completed crop season including their views on the 
potential environmental threats that might occur 
the american farmland trust which was founded in 1980 said it 
did not design the questions or interpret results with any 
hostility toward use of chemical fertilizers and pesticides 
it said the study was undertaken in preparation for the 1990 
farm bill debate under way in congress environmental issues 
including potential hazards of agricultural chemical pollution are 
expected to have high priority 
over many years report said chemicals have brought great 
benefits to american agriculture and consumers and are 
essential for financial viability in most farming situations 
today 
however there is widespread evidence that an overdependence 
on chemical use has developed and much effort is today devoted to 
seeking ways to enable farmers to economize on use of chemicals and 
fertilizer the report said 
the agriculture department was one of the sponsors of the study 
although most of the financing came from private foundations the 
usda currently is developing lisa or lowinput sustainable 
agriculture as an alternative to heavy use of crop chemicals and 
other practices that jeopardize soil and water resources 
some research findings show that many farmers apply excessive 
amounts of fertilizers or pesticides because they lack adequate 
information about what their fields really need or because they use 
very high applications as a form of insurance the report said 
moreover it added in some situations the threat or 
actuality of ground water or surface water pollution is high enough 
that a reduction in the use of chemicals may be necessary for 
health reasons 
crop rotation long recognized as a way to build up soils was 
used by a majority of the farmers in four of the five areas with 
54 percent to 82 percent employing the practice in 1988 the report 
said the exception was in butte county calif where only 20 
percent of those interviewed used rotations 
farmers were also asked whether they followed recommendations of 
fertilizer dealers or those of the federalstate cooperative 
extension service 
among interviewed farmers there were many more clients of 
fertilizer dealers than there were takers of advice from 
cooperative extension service the report said 
although 75 percent to 90 percent of the farmers favored changes 
in usda commodity programs that would permit planting more acres in 
rotation without losing base acres used to compute federal crop 
benefits most drew the line at a regulatory crackdown on excessive 
chemical use 
one option would require farmers have an approved plan for 
managing pesticide use if crop chemicals were found in their well 
water it was rejected in all five survey sites

democratic reforms have swept out the old 
guard in eastern europe but its legacy lingers on in the foreign 
intelligence agencies that continue to spy at home and abroad 
according to western specialists 
east european spies remain on the job even though the security 
and espionage agencies they serve now face reorganization under new 
governments the experts say 
authorities in east germany hungary czechoslovakia poland and 
bulgaria say security forces have a place even in open societies 
traditionally these nations have combined internal security 
operations with foreign espionage 
but the exact size and mandate of the surviving services as 
well as the fate of their foreign espionage networks is mostly 
obscured by the traditional lack of public accountability 
one new development is that under democratic leaders some 
cloakanddagger operations of the past such as the 1978 
assassination of bulgarian writer and defector georgi markov are 
being denounced and investigated but nowhere have espionage 
agencies been totally disbanded 
it is unclear what is happening to east germanys formidable 
foreign espionage department but west germans have expressed fears 
that east german spies will use the open borders to slip into their 
country 
west german interior minister wolfgang schaeuble said east 
germany for one continues its foreign espionage activities 
east germany would be well advised to pull back its agents 
even before a treaty on closer cooperation is signed he said in 
a recent interview referring to the comprehensive treaty that is 
supposed to be signed between the two states 
there have been no indications that spying for east berlin has 
stopped the stasi department in charge of espionage is functioning 
like it was during deposed leader erich honeckers time the 
munich magazine bunte quoted schaeuble as saying 
east germanys opposition has made the abolition of the secret 
service or stasi the top issue in current oppositiongovernment 
talks last week an angry east berlin mob stormed and looted the 
headquarters of the secret police 
in washington cia chief william webster said in a speech nov 
29 when only romania was still untouched by reform that soviet 
bloc espionage had increased 
around the world our stations are reporting more aggressive 
action a more robust intelligence collection effort more efforts 
to recruit our embassy and intelligence personnel than we have seen 
in a long time webster said 
the stuff is changing so fast that people are working hard 
just to keep up with it said one source at supreme headquarters 
allied powers europe 
it is unclear whether the increasing independence emerging in 
east european politics will spill over into the intelligence 
agencies which long have assisted the soviet union in its pursuit 
of western secrets and technology 
the former chief of hungarys state security service briggen 
ferenc pallagi said in an interview published late last year that 
taking orders on intelligence activities from the kremlin is a 
thing of the past 
both pallagi and his deputy briggen joszef horvath resigned 
last week amid allegations the intelligence service spied on 
opposition groups in advance of hungarys march parliamentary 
elections 
maj jozsef vegvari an officer in the security service said 
friday that as late as august there was a soviet adviser attached 
to the hungarian interior ministry which runs the sss 
the kgb is active in hungary for sure he said vegvari 
faces charges for revealing information to the political opposition 
on surveillance by his own service 
romanias internal secret police the securitate was dismantled 
after the december revolution but the former chief of the romanian 
intelligence service ion pacepa predicted romanias espionage 
will increase 
they will steal technology and now they will steal it much 
more easily because people in the west will want to help the 
romanians and will give them technology and they will give it to 
moscow said pacepa who defected to the united states a decade 
ago 
under the new noncommunist dominated czechoslovak government 
interior minister richard sacher announced last week that the stb 
the secret service charged with gathering information on 
dissidents had been disbanded 
however in an interview with the czechoslovak news agency ctk 
sacher said some interior ministry departments needed for the 
defense of the state will also be needed in independent 
czechoslovakia 
he did not specify what their job would be 
in warsaw sources within the solidarityled government have 
told the associated press they are trying to strip polands embassy 
in moscow of diplomats who worked for the soviet intelligence 
apparatus 
still relatively intact among the east bloc services is 
bulgarias state security known by its bulgarian initials ds 
after the november ouster of hardline communist leader todor 
zhivkov the reformminded leadership promised to publicize more 
information on intelligence activities as well as investigate the 
murder by poisontipped umbrella of markov the bulgarian dissident 
author killed in london in 12 years ago 
there has long been speculation that the orders to kill markov 
came from bucharest the scandal forced the resignation last week 
of jozsef horvath head of the internal security service 
but although bulgarias new leadership is trying to cast off its 
stalinist image the bulgarian domestic surveillance and foreign 
intelligence gathering operations appear to be continuing 
what we know is that almost every bulgarian who is doing some 
job abroad is an agent or informant of ds including diplomats 
journalists and trade functionaries said one bulgarian exile 
who monitors intelligence affairs and spoke in exchange for 
anonymity

more schools and more jobs for women would do 
most to hold down massive growth in the numbers of people in the 
third world a report by the population institute said sunday 
it found a link between ignorance and overpopulation 
the population explosion is no longer a prediction its 
already here according to the institute an advocacy group on 
this issue 
the study noted that last year the worlds population increased 
by over 90 million people 
rich countries like the united states have ignorant people as 
well as the third world though they are fewer the report said 
that among people in some industrial countries one in 10 is 
functionally illiterate that is they can read and write some 
but they can not follow printed instructions or write a simple 
letter 
the report said about 900 million of the worlds 55 billion 
people cannot read and that almost two out of every three 
illiterates are women 
in sudan women with no formal education had on average 65 
children it said but sudanese women with four to six years of 
school averaged five children and those with seven or more years of 
school averaged 34 children 
in mexico uneducated women had an average of eight 
children but women with seven or more years of education averaged 
27 the report said 
the study reported that women who get only one or two years of 
school tend to have more surviving childrern rather than fewer it 
suggested that was because even a little education helps a mother 
keep her babies alive women who stay at school longer get married 
later and know more about contraceptives 
the study was prepared by harold n burdett the institutes 
director of information and werner fornos its president 
nations that have opened up the schoolhouse and the workplace 
to women have experienced uniform declines in their fertility 
rates fornos said 
at a news conference he praised south korea for its program to 
give all girls eight years of school and to emphasize the textile 
industry as a big employer of women 
in bangladesh high fertility rates have been slow to 
decline and many girls are already married by the age of 13 the 
report said 
bangladesh where the average person has an income of 170 a 
year is one of the worlds poorest countries 
the report continued by contrast south korea a country of 
42 million people which has made significant economic strides in 
recent years has a 14 percent annual growth rate the lowest of 
any major developing nation in asia and the average age at first 
marriage has risen from 178 years several decades ago to 
approximately 23 years today 
the world bank put the average income in south korea at 3530 
in 1988 
fornos also cited mexico for encouraging industries along the 
border that make goods for the united states he said there are 
about 900 some of them as big as football fields where women 
do 85 percent of the work on such jobs as assembling computer parts 
he found 30 countries in the third world in this kind of 
restructuring from zimbabwe trying like south korea to keep girls 
in school for eight years to indonesia where mothers clubs 
help women care for their babies and learn new skills 
fornos warned of what he called the aspiration bomb the 
danger of educated young people turning to crime because they 
cannot find jobs he said he had seen the results in violent gangs 
of young graduates now worrying kenya where authorities have 
pushed education hard 
the report pointed to peru 
the anger and frustration of young peruvians who made 
sacrifices to obtain an education only to end up unemployed and 
disillusioned have resulted in drug addiction delinquency and 
radical politics for many it said

college freshmen are becoming more 
conservative about drugs and crime but more liberal about legalized 
abortion environmental issues and student activism according to a 
study released sunday 
the 24th annual survey of entering college freshmen conducted 
jointly by uclas higher education research institute and the 
american council on education found an abrupt change in student 
attitudes about legalized abortions 
support for legalized abortion which had remained fairly stable 
between 53 percent and 59 percent since 1977 jumped sharply 
between the 1988 and 1989 surveys from 57 percent to 647 percent 
an abrupt change in student attitudes of this magnitude in 
just one year is most unusual said alexander w astin professor 
of higher education at uclas graduate school of education and the 
surveys director 
he added that it may well reflect the students growing 
concern about the current supreme courts position on this highly 
charged topic 
the survey found the environment was the top concern with six 
out of every seven of those questioned agreeing that the federal 
government is not doing enough to control environmental pollution 
and 782 percent of the students endorsed greater governmental 
efforts to control handguns a new question asked for the first 
time in 1989 
support for abolition of the death penalty continued its sharp 
decline as did student use of drugs and alcohol the survey found 
a growing tendency toward greater student activism 
while student attitudes seem to be moving in a conservative 
direction on the issues of drugs and crime their views on most 
other issues are changing in a decidedly liberal direction said 
astin 
the 1989 national survey is based on the responses of 216362 
students at 403 of the nations two and fouryear colleges and 
universities these data have been statistically adjusted to 
reflect the responses of the 16 million firsttime fulltime 
students entering college as freshmen in the fall of 1989 
key findings were 
only 213 percent oppose the death penalty compared to 230 in 
1988 and 576 percent in 1971 
the percentage of freshmen who reported drinking beer dropped 
to 603 percent down from 653 percent in 1988 and 752 percent in 
1981 
freshmen who reported drinking wine or liquor dropped to 607 
percent in 1989 compared to 667 percent in 1988 
the percentage of students who agree that marijuana should be 
legalized reached another alltime low of 167 percent down from 
193 percent in 1988 and 529 percent in 1977 
the percent of students who agree that employers should be 
allowed to require drug testing of employees and job applicants 
jumped sharply from 71 percent to 778 percent between 1988 and 
1989 
according to the survey the share of freshmen who participated 
in organized demonstrations during the year prior to entering 
college reached a high of 367 percent which is greater than the 
percentages observed during the last 1960s 
at the same time the percentage of freshmen who said that there 
is a very good chance that they will participate in student 
protests or demonstrations in college also reached an alltime high 
of 63 percent up from 54 percent in 1988 and 47 percent in 1967 
an alltime high of 441 percent of students reported that it is 
a very important goal for them to influence social values 
this figure is up from 36 percent in 1987 and 311 percent in 1982 
for the fifth consecutive year student concern for the 
environment increased with 863 percent of freshmen wanting better 
federal efforts to control pollution compared with 839 percent in 
1988 and 809 percent in 1987 
the survey showed that student interest in becoming involved in 
programs to clean up the environment also increased with 261 
percent of the 1989 college freshmen saying that this is a very 
important life goal compared with only 159 percent in 1986 
these trends show not only that most students want more 
governmental action in the environmental field but that increasing 
numbers of them are willing to become personally involved in the 
effortsaid astin

district of columbia mayor marion barry 
seeking treatment after his arrest on federal cocaine charges 
often tried to convey the image of a toughondrugs executive while 
disputing reports he personally used narcotics 
on a radio callin show sept 17 1987 barry criticized a 
federal prosecutors decision to dismiss up to 400 drug cases 
because the police officers who investigated them were suspected of 
corruption 
my view is that the judge ought to decide whether or not the 
case ought to be thrown out or not prosecuted barry said 
were letting people who are poisoning our community almost 
really go free it sends the wrong signal to that community 
when traces of cocaine were discovered in the hotel room of 
former city employee charles lewis after barry visited him in 
december 1988 the mayor said through a spokesman i would never 
knowingly associate with anybody using drugs or dealing with drugs 
under no circumstances would i associate with anybody doing this 
on march 14 1989 barry and other city officials met with 
william j bennett head of the national drug control policy 
office and the mayor said that he and i agreed there will be 
no quick fixes he said he told bennett the city needed more 
money to expand drug treatment programs and stem drugrelated 
killings 
nine days later he told the national press club drugs are 
the problem not marion barry i urge the media to be fair 
talking about the growing crime wave including record numbers of 
homicides he said 
for the most part the targeted killings and drug activity 
take place in a small section of the city except for the killings 
washington has one of the lowest crime rates in the country 
congress is safe everyone is safe i hope to come back here 
next year and tell you washington is safer than ever before 
in may 1989 after his administration came under fire for 
failing to stem the increase in drugrelated violence in the city 
the mayor arrived at an alleged crack house with eviction papers in 
his hand and television cameras by his side surprising 16 people 
in the apartment and federal agents who had arrived an hour later 
to serve a search warrant 
barry directed city workers to nail the apartments windows and 
doors shut but treasury department agents tore down the plywood 
boards when they arrived with the warrant no one was arrested in 
either raid 
on april 4 1989 testifying before the senate appropriations 
subcommittee on the district of columbia barry outlined a 102 
million plan for stemming drugrelated violence but sen robert 
kerrey dneb dismissed it as a chamber of commerce document 
and accused the mayor of glossing over the citys problems 
if i were to judge you on the job youre doing with drugs and 
i were given a vote i wouldnt vote for you kerrey said in 
the absence of a community committed to solving the problem no 
amount of money would help

that suggests dinner guests be told if someone with aids is at the 
table 
the publisher doubleday said in a press release saturday that 
many have complained that the passage in the book mayflower 
manners is insensitive 
most people will know that they cannot contract the disease by 
being seated at a dinner table with a carrier miss barrows 
wrote but it is a courtesy to all to let them know ahead of 
time 
miss barrows said in the release my advice was intended to 
protect the feelings of such a guest from the ignorance of those 
who might inadvertently bring up a subject causing discomfort to 
the guest i intended no other meaning or inference 
she said the passage would be deleted in future printings 
the book by ellis weiner and miss barrows is described by the 
publisher as a satirical and tongueincheek advice book

highprice escort service pleaded guilty in 1985 to a misdemeanor 
charge of promoting prostitution and paid a 5000 fine she was 
dubbed the mayflower madam because she traces some of her 
ancestors to the group that came over on the mayflower

he tried to tell washington says david 
funderburk but during four years as ambassador to romania he 
couldnt convince anyone that nicolae ceausescu was a murderous 
tyrant undeserving of american favors 
it was like beating my head against a brick wall funderburk 
said in an interview from his home in buies creek nc where he 
now runs an anticommunist foundation 
we reported what was really happening and the whole litany of 
horrors that ceausescu was carrying out but my reports werent 
reaching the top people and they certainly werent being factored 
into our relationship 
funderburk 45 a former college teacher fluent in romanian 
says he knows why when president reagan appointed him in 1981 he 
was regarded by the state department as a protege of sen jesse 
helms rnc the departments nemesis 
now of course the world knows that funderburks descriptions 
were accurate ceausescu ran a police state his people were 
virtually starved while romanian farm products were sent abroad 
women were penalized if they refused to have babies clergymen and 
opponents were killed every typewriter had to be registered 
the united states funderburk said is still following a 
wrongheaded policy in romania backing ceausescus successor 
communist ion iliescu head of the national salvation front 
government 
we ought to be offering our moral support to the outmanned 
noncommunists he said 
during the nixon administration the united states had seen a 
streak of independence in ceausescu to encourage other communists 
to inch away from moscow romania was given most favored nation 
trade status and ceausescu was showered with attention 
presidents nixon and ford and other high officials visited 
offering praise for ceausescus courage nixon and president 
carter lavishly welcomed him to washington 
funderburk said george bush who was then vice president 
alexander m haig who was secretary of state and businessmen who 
wanted to trade with romania trekked over to bucharest to do 
homage to ceausescu 
he said he asked the visitors to press ceausescu to honor his 
human rights commitments but they had been told to just ignore 
funderburk 
career diplomat francis b corry assigned as funderburks 
deputy confirmed that the ambassador was persona non grata in the 
state deparment 
he had the reputation not entirely deserved of being a 
protege of jesse helms said corry who has since retired 
corry added that helms relationship with the department of 
state being what it was there was little david funderburk could do 
to help his relationship with the department 
as for the kid gloves policy toward ceausescu corry said was 
the policy of differentiation which was conceived in kissingerian 
times wise an argument could be made either way 
we never got a hell of a lot of true independence from 
ceausescu how could they be independent with a 1500kilometer 
border with the soviet union 
on the other hand corry said i felt and in this i agreed 
with the department that having extended most favored nation 
status pulling it back would remove whatever leverage we had with 
ceausescu 
the romanian dictator had demonstrated a degree of maverick 
behavior he maintained ties with west germany refused to break 
relations with israel after the sixday war refused to boycott the 
1984 olympics in los angeles and declined to back soviet 
interventions in czechoslovakia and afghanistan 
moreover tens of thousands of jews were allowed to leave it 
later turned out ceausescu had received thousands of dollars from 
israel for each emigre 
funderburk argued ceausescus independence was a ploy behind 
the scenes he was collaborating with the soviets and sharing the 
western techology he was allowed to import he advised washington 
unable to budge the state department funderburk said he used 
his influence with conservatives to arrange a 1983 oval office 
meeting with ronald reagan 
the president seemed sympathetic and surprised but unless he 
heard the same message day after day he wasnt about to act against 
his own secretary of state funderurk said thus the 
groveling continued 
the department furious that he had gone around channels 
undertook to force him out as ambassador funderburk said finally 
in 1985 he quit in frustration he said 
funderburk said he remains appalled at us policy we rushed 
in with a new ambassador and recognized the provisional government 
most of those characters are people who worked with ceausescu here 
we are propping up a communist government composed of people the 
people hate we dont learn anything

pope john paul ii will visit czechoslovakia in the 
second half of april and diplomatic relations between prague and 
the vatican could be restored before then czechoslovak officials 
said sunday 
it will be john pauls first voyage to an eastern european 
country other than his native poland marking another breakthrough 
in ties between the vatican and soviet bloc nations that have shed 
their hardline communist leaders 
a czechoslovak government delegation issued the invitation to 
the pope saturday on behalf of president vaclav havel and cardinal 
frantisek tomasek the archbishop of prague and the roman catholic 
primate of czechoslovakia 
the vatican reported saturday that the pope had accepted the 
invitation but said only that the trip would take place sometime 
before the czechoslovak elections in june 
jan carnogursky first deputy prime minister and head of the 
government delegation told a news conference the pope will visit 
prague velehrad and bratislava in the last half of april 
he said final details were still being worked out and he could 
not confirm some published reports in italy and hungary that the 
trip would begin april 21 
carnogursky said the government invited the pope as a great 
moral authority as head of the catholic faith which has millions 
of followers in czechoslovakia and as a major personality in 
todays world 
all three aspects symbolize the dimension of the changes 
realized in czechoslovakia recently he said 
carnogursky said the new czechoslovak government wants to 
reestablish diplomatic relations with the holy see as soon as 
possible and that the pope and vatican secretary of state 
agostino casaroli agreed ties were broken by czechoslovakia in 
1949 
the official said an announcement on resumption of diplomatic 
ties could come soon after the appointment of new roman catholic 
bishops in march five of the countrys 13 bishoprics are vacant 
the former communist regime blocked some of the vaticans 
appointments but carnogursky said the new government would pose 
no obstacles or problems to the naming of new bishops 
the czechoslovak parliament on tuesday will abolish a 1949 
decree requiring government approval of bishops appointments thus 
giving the holy see a free hand to name its own candidates the 
officials said 
the intention of the new democratic government is that there 
be freedom of religion said josef hromadka deputy prime 
minister with responsibility for religious affairs 
as recently as two years ago the pope decried the sorry 
state of the church in czechoslovakia where an estimated 60 
percent of the 15 million people are roman catholics but 
improvements were made last year even before the opposition 
victory that ended the communists 41year domination of the 
government 
the vatican is also expected to reestalish relations with 
hungary shortly the pope is scheduled to travel to hungary in 
september 1991 
last july poland became the first warsaw pact country to 
restore full ties with the holy see

stung by the loss of two top house democrats 
and the problems of five senators embroiled in a savings and loan 
furor congressional leaders are weighing a substantial revamping 
of campaign finance laws 
a bipartisan house task force is at work on the problem and 
senate leaders seem determined to watch what the house does before 
acting on their own complicating prospects for passage is the fact 
that all 435 members of the house and a third of the senate are up 
for reelection this year 
still speaker thomas s foley was able on sunday to predict 
passage of a reform bill in the house 
i think its going to happen in this session at least in 
the house the washington democrat said on nbcs meet the 
press 
congress historically has been reluctant to legislate in this 
politically touchy area especially in an election year and this 
issue has been bogged down in partisan argument since early 1988 
yet pressure is building thanks largely to the political 
brouhaha surrounding phoenix millionaire charles h keating jr and 
the five senators to whom he gave 13 million in campaign and 
other contributions in his fight with savings and loan regulators 
the five senators alan cranston dcalif dennis deconcini 
dariz john mccain rariz john glenn dohio and donald w 
riegle dmich are now subjects of senate ethics committee 
inquiries for interceding with sampl regulators on keatings behalf 
this political firestorm which ignited last year after house 
speaker jim wright and democratic whip tony coelho resigned amid 
ethics problems has given impetus to the fight for campaign 
finance reform 
with the exception of watergate i cant remember a single 
incident that has educated people all over the country on the real 
price that is paid in a campaign financing system that allows money 
to be used for buying influence said fred wertheimer head of 
the selfstyled citizens lobby common cause 
a 21member bipartisan house task force has been instructed by 
foley and republican leader robert h michel of illinois to have a 
bill ready as soon as possible after congress returns tuesday 
no specific date was set but congressional officials working on 
the package said the clear intent of foleys directions was to have 
a bipartisan package prepared for a vote in march 
in the senate democratic leader george mitchell of maine and 
gop leader bob dole of kansas discussed setting up a similar task 
force after congress adjourned last month 
while senate leaders want to see what the house does first 
before producing a package of their own the leader of the last 
failed reform effort sen david boren dokla is working with 
mccain one of the keating five on a bipartisan proposal 
wertheimers organization which advocates spending limits and 
federal financing of campaigns filed the initial complaint with 
the ethics panel last october this forced the inquiries into the 
five senators intervention with the federal home loan bank board 
on behalf of keatings nowcollapsed lincoln savings and loan 
based in irvine calif 
all five senators have denied they intervened with the bank 
board in the lincoln case because of keatings contributions the 
five said they often intercede with federal agencies on behalf of 
constituents who are not contributors 
just how much reform will be in a campaign finance bill that 
can win both democratic and republican support and not pose a 
serious threat to the careers of incumbent lawmakers is in doubt 
common cause has dropped its demand for public financing of the 
type used in presidential campaigns since the passage of the last 
significant campaign money law in 1974 following the watergate 
scandal 
public financing and voluntary spending ceilings wanted by 
democrats but opposed by republicans stymied the last reform 
effort in 198788 
after congress adjourned with the keating controversy fresh in 
its mind michel told the national press club he would give 
personal consideration to some type of cap indicating a 
softening in the gops historic opposition to spending ceilings 
instead of offering government campaign dollars to candidates 
who abide by voluntary spending ceilings compulsory caps are 
illegal under a supreme court decision democrats are talking of 
using discount mail and tv advertising rates as a carrot for 
compliance 
socalled soft money contributions which go to national and 
state party organizations or independent groups and foundations 
utilized by members of congress remain a major stumbling block 
most of those contributions do not now have to be reported to 
the federal election commission and only a few states such as 
california require their disclosure keating contributed 85000 
each to republican and democratic party committees in california 
where lincolns 29 thrift branches operated 
republican members of congress who rely on their party more 
than democrats for raising election money are opposed to any 
measure that would curb that ability but they want to restrict 
business trade association and labor pacs that increasingly are 
becoming the biggest source of cash for incumbent democrats 
theres always support for campaign finance reform in general 
but when it comes down to specifics thats where everything breaks 
down said ross baker a campaign finance expert at rutgers 
university 
until republicans get over their distaste for public financing 
and democrats give up their love affair with pacs he said the 
best reform would be requiring more disclosure 
the ultimate sanction against a candidate who takes too much 
money or money from the wrong people is that an opponent can 
use it as an issue he said thats the great dagger hanging 
over the heads of those five senators 
none of the keating five however is among the 33 senators 
up for reelection this year

for the past 13 years robert randall has made 
regular trips to a pharmacy to get legally and free what many 
others buy on the street at the risk of arrest marijuana 
randall was the first person allowed by the federal government 
to use the drug for medical purposes in his case as a treatment 
for the blinding eye disease glaucoma under what is termed a 
compassionate protocol 
others have received permission to use marijuana legally for 
controlling nausea caused by anticancer drugs for pain relief and 
for controlling muscle spasms in people with multiple sclerosis 
but randall says its easier for patients to get the drug in an 
illegal street sale than through the legitimate but timeconsuming 
and bureaucratic process that allows governmentgrown marijuana to 
be distributed free by prescription as an experimental drug 
its an extraordinary process to engage in it stretches the 
word compassionate to the limit randall said an interview last 
week at his washington home ive watched one or two people go 
blind while waiting 
only four other people two with glaucoma one with cancer and 
one with aids currently are receiving marijuana from the 
government said randall president of the alliance for cannabis 
therapeutics 
the food and drug administration did not know how many people 
have gotten marijuana under a compassionate protocol but a 
spokesman said at least two dozen protocols some covering groups 
of patients have been approved since randalls in 1976 most of 
the protocols now are inactive either because patients have died 
or have switched to other drugs 
the process starts with a request from a physician for 
authorization to prescribe marijuana for a patient if the fda 
approves the physicians plans the request goes to the national 
institute for drug abuse which is responsible for growing the drug 
on a mississippi farm 
after nida certifies it has a supply of the drug the request 
goes to the drug enforcement administration which must assure 
tight control over distribution of the drug 
randalls group and the national organization for the reform of 
marijuana laws went to court again on friday to try to force the 
dea to change marijuanas status as a schedule i drug which is 
available only for research to a schedule ii drug which would 
make it available for patient use as morphine and cocaine are 
a dea administrative law judge in 1988 recommended that 
marijuana be reclassified but dea administrator john lawn rejected 
the recommendation dec 29 saying the judge ignored the scientific 
evidence 
randall said lawns action ignores the pain of the ill solely to 
promote his political agenda the war against illegal drugs 
for me marijuana is just another medication randall said 
adding that the only effect he gets from the drug is therapeutic 
it reduces the pressure inside his eye helping him retain his 
vision 
randall who turns 42 on tuesday gets by prescription 300 
neatly rolled marijuana cigarettes a month and smokes 10 of them 
each day he said he hasnt gotten high from the drug for years 
partly because of the low potency of governmentgrade marijuana 
the american academy of ophthalmology committee on drugs says 
that while marijuana can lower intraocular pressure there is no 
evidence the drug can safely and effectively lower it enough to 
prevent optic nerve damage 
besides the longterm lung damage that can occur from smoking 
the drug shortterm side effects include euphoria low blood 
pressure and eye dryness the committee said the panel said 
longterm studies are needed 
dr keith green a regents professor of ophthalmology at the 
medical college of georgia in augusta ga who has studied 
marijuana said better drugs than marijuana are available for 
glaucoma patients 
if this were a worthwhile venture there would be much greater 
utilization and recommendation of its use by the physicians in the 
ophthalmology community green said 
but dr ivan silverberg a medical oncologist in san francisco 
said that among cancer and aids patients theres still a lot of 
interest in using marijuana to control nausea and pain 
patients use it all the time he said its very common in 
the bay area among older as well as younger patients 
he added that while this is not the greatest drug known to 
man it is the most effective of the outpatient drugs for 
controlling nausea because patients can get relief in a matter of 
seconds without having to swallow a pill and keep it down for 30 to 
90 minutes also smoking allows a patient better dose control 
because they can stop when they get relief he said 
silverberg said hes not willing to go through the steps needed 
to get permission to prescribe marijuana for patients because the 
governments process is too timeconsuming and patients who want it 
can easily get it 
i dont prescribe it i dont smoke it and i dont have a 
reputation as a pot doctor silverberg said but he added if 
i think a patient is going to be nauseated well talk about it

more than 2000 students rallied in 
bucharest on sunday to demand an end to the last vestiges of 
communist rule from incompetent professors to the ideological 
institute that trained past officials 
the protesters outside bucharest university booed the mention of 
the former communist youth union and chanted liberty and 
solidarity as a string of speakers called for students to 
become a force in building a new democratic romania 
loud applause greeted eduard cucu a student from the northern 
city of iasi as he announced we have organized to get rid of 
incompetent teachers and the teachers who told the security forces 
what was going on 
last week students at bucharests sprawling polytechnic 
university began a campaign to rid the student body of police 
informers and professors who obtained their posts through party 
affiliation 
the bucharest university administration is considering whether 
to fire mihaela ceausescu a niece of executed dictator nicolae 
ceausescu from her post as a professor of russian 
it was common under the ceausescu regime for doctorates to be 
awarded on the basis of party standing rather than academic 
qualifications 
the students repeatedly broke into chants of down with the 
incompetents during the more than twohour demonstration 
the loudest jeering and booing came when philosophy student 
daniel oghina spoke out against the stefan gheorghiu social and 
political academy which trained many of the officials in 
ceausescus dreaded securitate secret police force 
the academy served as the ideological training school for all 
ceausescus officials and was a necessary gate to further 
advancement in both the party and the government under the 
dictator ceausescu was elected by firing squad christmas day 
oghina said authorities want to keep the institute going and 
give it the ironic new title of the free academy of stefan 
gheorghiu gheorghiu was a prewar communist leader in romania 
theyre repeating the same structures of the old regime he 
said 
the interim governments plans for the academy could not 
immediately be determined 
some of the speakers also complained of the actions of the 
governing national salvation front which took over after the 
revolution that ousted ceausescu one sign held by demonstrators 
read down with the securitate people in the new government 
we want the provisional government to be formed of people who 
will represent the romanian people student dan josef told the 
crowd which blocked nicolae balcescu boulevard one of the main 
streets of bucharest 
dumitru mazilu vice president of the national salvation front 
has come under fire since the revolution for reportedly holding a 
colonels rank in the securitate during the 1970s 
after falling from favor in the ceausescu regime he became one 
of the nations most internationally known dissidents 
the national salvation front has so far defended mazilu 
pointing to his conversion to a human rights advocate and critic of 
the ceausescu regime 
sundays demonstration came a month after bloody fighting in 
bucharest some of it along the same boulevard where the students 
gathered 
after a moment of silence for the thousands of people who died 
in the revolution the crowd held their hands up in victory signs 
and sang the formerly banned song awake romania a nationalist 
song dating from the turkish domination of the nation which ended 
in the late 19th century 
the song starts awake romania from your mortal sleep that the 
barbarians and tyrants put you in wed rather die in glorious 
battle than become slaves again 
most of the demonstration however was made up of speakers 
calling on students to unify 
several french students also spoke to the crowd raising chants 
of vive la roumanie and vive la france 
one french student who did not give his name told the 
romanians you gave us a lesson in democracy for this we 
thank you

seoul south korea ap president roh taewoo has agreed to 
dissolve his governing party to create a new conservative party in 
alliance with two moderate opposition groups top politicians said 
sunday 
roh also has agreed to revise the constitution to replace the 
countrys present presidential system of government with a 
parliamentary system to be headed by a prime minister the 
officials said 
the plan is designed to break a deadlock in the legislature 
which is controlled by three opposition parties whose strong 
rivalries have prevented them from working together against the 
governing party 
the plan would also dwarf the nations most radical opposition 
party the party for peace and democracy and its charismatic 
leader kim daejung 
in addition the parliamentary system would allow roh the chance 
to remain in power as prime minister after his fiveyear term as 
president ends in 1993 
those familiar with the agreement said it will be formalized at 
a meeting monday between roh kim youngsam leader of the no 2 
opposition group the reunification democratic party and kim 
jongpil a former premier who heads the no 3 opposition group 
the new democratic republican party 
kim jongpil said the threeway talks will formally announce the 
creation of a new conservative party everything has been set for 
the new party he told a meeting of party lawmakers sunday night 
he said five delegates from each party will begin working 
together tuesday to prepare for the new party expected to emerge 
about a month later 
an official in the governing democratic justice party said that 
the three parties agreed during weeks of private discussions to 
create a new party and to change the constitution to adopt a 
cabinet system of government 
they also agreed that the new party to be formed will try to 
comprise all liberal democratic forces said the official who 
requested anonymity 
insiders said roh agreed to the realignment initiated by the 
two opposition parties after kim youngsam reversed himself and 
agreed to support changing from a presidential system to a cabinet 
system of government 
the new party could be a serious setback for kim daejung 
leader of the hardline opposition party for peace and democracy 
his party would be dwarfed by the new party thus limiting his 
chances of coming to power 
the governing party may have agreed to the realignment because 
it has no clear successor to roh whose single fiveryear term 
expires in 1993 
governing party officials have made it clear they hope to 
imitate japans governing liberal democratic party which has long 
remained in power under a cabinet system of government 
rohs governing party has been in an uncomfortable situation 
since it lost a parliamentary majority in the 1988 general 
elections the three main opposition parties have a combined 
majority in the 299member national assembly but intense rivalry 
has made it difficult for them to cooperate 
the new party to be formed is expected to have a collective 
leadership with roh serving as a ceremonial head 
a merger of the three parties will also assure it of a twothird 
majority required in parliament to introduce the constitutional 
revision 
insiders said the new party would push a constitutional revision 
during the term of the current assembly which expires in may 
1992 a constitutional draft adopted in parliament must be approved 
in a national referendum 
even if a new constitution is adopted rohs term which expires 
in february 1993 is expected to be completed by him

health minister claude evin has added his name to 
the list of prominent europeans threatening to boycott an aids 
meeting in san francisco unless the us congress changes a law 
they say stupidly discriminates against aids victims 
evin in a letter to world health organization secretarygeneral 
dr hiroshi nakajima condemned the us immigration law that he 
said discriminates on the basis of health he said he will not 
attend the huge sixth international conference on aids to be held 
june 2024 in san francisco in the absence of guarantees 
respecting individual liberty 
evins letter was dated jan 13 and its contents were carried 
friday by the news agency agence francepresse 
who is one of the sponsors of the prestigious meeting which 
each year draws doctors researchers health officials and 
representatives from many of the worlds most respected health 
organizations 
at least 16 organizations from france scandinavia britain and 
elsewhere have announced that they plan to boycott the meeting 
unless the us government changes a policy that prohibits people 
suffering aids from entering the united states without a special 
waiver 
those granted the waiver have their passports stamped with a 
permanent number indicating they are infected with the hiv virus 
that causes the deadly disease 
critics complain the law violates an individuals right to 
privacy punishes the honest makes the individual vulnerable to 
discrimination at home and is not justified on public health 
grounds 
to us europeans this seems a profoundly shocking policy 
especially in light of americas wellpublicized belief in freedom 
and respect for human rights it stupidly discriminates and deeply 
contradicts americas stated values said henri maurel spokesman 
for the french group aparts which assists people with acquired 
immune deficiency syndrome 
since the early 1950s the united states has required that 
people requesting an entry visa declare if they are infected with 
contagious diseases such as syphillis leprosy or tuberculosis the 
question has not been uniformly applied and was not asked at all of 
travelers coming from countries that do not require visas like 
canada 
in 1987 under a measure introduced by sen jesse helms rnc 
aids was added to the list critics claim that immigration 
officials then went on a campaign to ferret out people suffering 
from aids even going through luggage looking for medicine used to 
treat the disease 
our end is not to stay away from this important meeting 
said manon fournerie spokeswoman for franceaids what we want 
is to call attention to the problem and for the united states to 
change this discriminatory law 
protests of the law have come from the international societies 
of the red cross the world health organization the world 
federation of hemophilia and the national commission on aids the 
commission makes recommendations to the us congress and president 
to develop a consistent national policy on fighting aids 
the way you deal with aids is by educating the population not 
by sealing off the border said dr june e osborn head of the 
national commission on aids and chairman of the university of 
michigan school of public health 
osborn in a telephone interview pointed out that unlike some 
infectious diseases aids is spread by specific controllable 
behavior 
it is spread most often through sexual contact needles or 
syringes shared by drug abusers infected blood or blood products 
and from pregnant women to their offspring 
the policy is illconceived and irrational she said 
those who are aware they have the disease and are under treatment 
are the least likely to be any threat 
only congress can rescind the law 
in an effort to deal with the criticism meetings have been held 
over the last few weeks by the agencies involved in administering 
it including the justice department state department and 
department of health and human services 
american health officials fear there is not enough time before 
the meeting in san francisco for congress to make sufficient 
changes in the law to satisfy critics

an exconvict charged with sexually 
mutilating a small boy is scheduled to go on trial monday as major 
legislation sparked by public outrage at the crime moves toward 
passage at the state legislature 
prosecutors say they will seek a life sentence for earl kenneth 
shriner 39 if he is convicted on charges he raped and tried to 
kill the child by severing his penis and choking him during an 
attack may 20 
the child then 7 was wandering naked and dazed when he was 
found by his mother and grandmother near his home in woods where 
the attack occurred 
shriner has pleaded innocent to two counts of rape and one count 
each of firstdegree assault and firstdegree attempted murder 
the boy is scheduled to testify 
he doesnt say much but i can tell by his actions that he 
would rather run away and hide but hes also ready to turn and 
face the problem because he realizes running and hiding isnt the 
way to end it for him said his mother helen harlow 
the child is back in school and doing all the things normal 
little boys do his mother said he faces the second of two 
operations to repair the damage inflicted by his assailants knife 
and will be restored to normal functions in every way ms 
harlow said 
the childs medical psychiatric and other costs are being paid 
from a trust fund of 600000 formed from donations that poured in 
from all over the country said ms harlow she has no access to 
the fund herself and lives off earnings from a parttime job 
the case enraged the public and led gov booth gardner to form 
a special panel that drafted legislation to snare more sex 
predators 
the measure heading for unusually quick and almost certain 
passage in this election year toughens sexoffender sentences ans 
creates a procedure to indefinitely commit highly violent offenders 
through a civil procedure after they have served their criminal 
sentences it also requires sex offenders to register with county 
sheriffs for from 10 to 15 years and permits authorities to warn 
communities when an offender is in their midst 
the bill was introduced after the legislature convened jan 8 
and is due for a vote on the senate floor monday 
three legislators also are pushing measures authorizing surgical 
castration of incorrigible sex offenders 
gardners 17 million package elements of which have been 
blasted by the american civil liberties union as totalitarian 
concepts was a direct result of the shriner case said state 
rep marlin appelwick who heads the house judiciary committee 
other crimes also spurred support for the measure the 1988 
slaying of a seattle woman by a known sex offender later sentenced 
to life the killings of three boys in vancouver wash last 
summer allegedly by a known child molester still facing trial and 
the killing of a female jogger last fall in whatcom county police 
have announced no suspects in the joggers death 
my only regret is it took this tragedy with this little boy to 
get us all to take such a serious look at the damage sex offenders 
are doing and when even worse atrocities are happening to women 
every day appelwick said its too bad it took a male victim 
to get everybodys attention 
shriner is being held in lieu of 1 million bail one of his 
attorneys public defender lloyde alton has complained that the 
tidal wave of publicity threatens his clients right to an 
impartial jury the defense won the right to pick the jury in 
another county and bring the panel to tacoma where it will be 
sequestered 
shriner completed a 10year prison term for kidnap and assault 
of two teenage girls shortly before the attack on the boy 
officials testified at recent legislative hearings that they 
knew shriner was likely to commit sex crimes upon release but 
under washington law had no way to confine him after he served his 
sentence 
prison officials told legislators they found drawings and 
diaries in shriners prison cell with detailed plans to 
sexually assault children superior court judge thomas sauriol 
ruled against use of the material by the prosecution which will 
rely on the boys testimony and on hair and blood samples among 
other things prosecutors said

congress is bracing for partisan budget fights 
over defense spending the social security system and tax breaks as 
president bush prepares to unveil his proposed 1991 fiscal plan at 
months end 
bushs budget which sources say will call for 124 trillion in 
spending is already being panned by democrats who control congress 
for its expected embrace of assorted dogeared republican proposals 
to save money these include eliminations or reductions of domestic 
programs like mass transit aid and energy assistance to the poor 
this will be a dinosaur budget a warmover of what weve seen 
before senate budget committee chairman james sasser dtenn 
said recently it will be the whole laundry list that congress 
hasnt accepted for nine years 
for their part republicans are already showing that they will 
not be bashful about pushing their own budgetary agenda this year 
in a speech last week bush referred to demagogues who are 
opposing his resurrected proposal to cut the tax rate on capital 
gains which he claims will raise money for government coffers 
the higher pitched political rhetoric is being fanned by the 
fact that this is an election year with the entire house and 
onethird of the senate up for reelection in november members of 
the two parties plan to use the budget to show voters what they 
stand for and how they differ from their opponents 
both parties will be jockeying for position foresees house 
budget committee chairman leon panetta dcalif democrats will 
be pushing for increased initiatives on human needs and 
republicans will be trying to protect their no new taxes pledge 
frankly both positions together arent going to help speed the 
budget process 
the budget year that bush launches when he submits his spending 
blueprint to congress on jan 29 is expected to be have three major 
battlefields each contest will shape a crucial part of the savings 
mix the president needs to heed the grammrudman laws requirement 
for a projected deficit next year of no more than 64 billion 
bowing to deficit pressures and to diminishing tensions with the 
eastern bloc bush plans to call for 303 billion in defense 
spending which would be 2 percent less than necessary to keep this 
years 297 billion level abreast of inflation 
democrats with liberals such as reps george miller dcalif 
and barney frank dmass leading the way are already saying 
bushs cut is not deep enough even the more moderate sasser says 
he would like to see military spending reduced to about 295 
billion 
with democrats holding majorities in the house and senate the 
only questions seem to be how large the socalled peace 
dividend will be and where the savings will go the majority 
party is split over the latter with liberals urging an expansion 
of ailing domestic programs like education and health and others 
hoping to use the savings to lower the deficit 
another fight will be over the huge surpluses the social 
security system is running 
there is bipartisan consensus that the surplus does little more 
than hide the true size of the overall deficit which was 152 
billion last year but would have been 204 billion without the 
social security windfall the dispute arises over what to do about 
it 
although opinions on the issue cross party lines republicans 
tend to couple removal of the social security surpluses from 
deficit calculations with an extension of the grammrudman law 
that legislation which mandates a balanced budget in 1993 and then 
expires tends to keep domestic spending down most democrats 
oppose a grammrudman extension 
a wild card is a proposal by sen daniel moynihan dny who 
wants to lower the 765 percent payroll tax employers and workers 
pay to support social security the plan puts bush in the 
uncomfortable position of opposing a tax cut but opponents say the 
reduction would jeopardize the savings needed to pay baby boomers 
retirement benefits 
house speaker thomas s foley dwash in his first public 
statement on the plan said sunday he would vote against the plan 
if he had to vote on it now he called for the proposal to be 
studied very carefully 
also likely to cause a clash is bushs capital gains reduction 
plan democrats who say the proposal is actually a moneyloser 
narrowly defeated it in 1989 after a bitter political clash but 
concede that the measure will likely be enacted this year 
a fight will evolve as democrats struggle to win something in 
return perhaps an improved individual retirement account to 
benefit the middle and lowerclass 
other elements of the years budget clash should sound familiar 
chief among them will be questions over the administrations 
economic projections the better the economic forecast the more 
revenues the government can expect to collect and the lower the 
anticipated deficit 
administration sources say they will project next years 
economic growth to be about 26 percent well above the amount many 
private economists expect since the grammrudman law requires use 
of the administration forecast democrats are helpless to do more 
than complain 
using these optimistic projections the white house is expected 
to say that it needs 30 billion to 35 billion in savings to reach 
the grammrudman deficit target of 64 billion the nonpartisan 
congressional budget office is expected to say that the needed 
savings will be more than twice as high 
bush is expected to propose minor initiatives in certain 
education environment antidrug child care and science programs 
democrats are ready to claim that his proposals fall short of what 
is needed

panamanians have gone on a spree of 
witch hunts in the political shakeup following the us invasion 
sometimes using american troops to settle personal vendettas us 
army and panamanian sources say 
the persistent accusations dismissals of public employees and 
charges made in the news media are hindering the organization of 
president guillermo endaras new government frustrating american 
officials and delaying the removal of us forces according to the 
sources 
everyone has turned into a squealer said army col charles 
morris director of a 200member special group called in to help 
the new government organize itself 
they have gone wild said another us army source on 
condition of anonymity they are using the us army for their 
own personal revenge we get calls from someone saying there are 
weapons in some house and we have to check it 
shortly after the dec 20 invasion toppled gen manuel antonio 
noriega the us army began acting as a police force for the new 
government 
american forces have arrested not only former members of 
noriegas high command but leftists and leaders of old political 
parties including the leftist democratic revolutionary party that 
backed the old government 
as of friday the us army still held 100 military and civilian 
prisoners at fort clayton at the request of the panamanian 
government which was sorting out possible charges against some 
of them 
newspapers have become a daily register of purported wrongdoings 
by government officials business leaders and politicians who once 
had some tie to noriega 
us soldiers often following tips from neighbors or 
ideological foes arrested many members of leftist political 
parties and held them for two or three days in some cases their 
main sin was militancy in the communist party 
the soldiers would come in and arrest someone or they would 
go into an office and take what they wanted said mario rognoni 
who spent three days in custody because he served in government 
under noriega then they would encourage people to loot the place 
so they could blame the sacking on them 
the army took our computer our records and then left it open 
so people could take everything else alleged rognoni a 
democratic revolutionary party leader 
the retaliation has even extended to the girlfriends and 
mistresses of pronoriega officials who have had sofas cars and 
even dishes seized on the assumption they were bought with stolen 
money 
leaders of the new political opposition claim more than 8000 
public employees have been fired after they were accused of having 
been loyal to the past regime 
but many of the public employees were forced by the noriega 
government to participate in progovernment demonstrations or join 
the paramilitary groups it was either that or lose their jobs 
said a former member of a paramilitary organization what were 
you supposed to do when you have a family to feed 
the endara government has seized at least 10 radio stations and 
two television stations owned by people suspected of association 
with noriega 
more than 100 official accusations or private lawsuits filed 
against former government officials have piled up at the attorney 
generals office all must be investigated said attorney general 
rogelio cruz 
meanwhile the two competing newspapers la estrella and el 
siglo have been trying to outdo each other showing how close to 
noriega the others director was 
there is hatred there is desire for revenge the country has 
gone mad said rognoni 
the worst part said a politician who spoke on condition of 
anonymity is that the new ins who now own this country did not 
fight for it 
the gringos gave it to them on a silver platter they did not 
shed a single drop of blood for it

john stalker the cop whose thwarted investigation 
came to symbolize doubts about justice in northern ireland is back 
to haunt the british government 
stalker who was removed in 1986 before completing an inquiry 
into killings by police in northern ireland says he has 
documentary proof his ouster was engineered by senior civil 
servants possibly at the cabinet level in prime minister 
margaret thatchers government 
if stalker is to be believed and the government strongly 
denies it his removal was intended to obstruct an investigation 
of alleged murder and perjury by officers of the royal ulster 
constabulary northern irelands police force 
trevor forbes recently retired as chief of the rucs 
antiterrorist special branch was quoted by the sunday times as 
saying there was no conspiracy and no coverup within the ruc 
if there had been he argued stalkers deputy also would have 
been removed but he was not 
stalkers new claim of proof came last week after fraud charges 
against his friend kevin taylor were dismissed in manchester 
crown court 
it was stalkers alleged association with known criminals 
that led to his suspension from the investigation his association 
with taylor was at the core of the inquiry 
i have always said that the charges against mr taylor were a 
contrivance a means of getting at me through him stalker said 
taylors attorneys said detectives lied to obtain a warrant to 
examine taylors bank records documents relating to the warrant 
are now missing prosecutors acknowledge 
taylor intends to sue for malicious prosecution his attorneys 
said 
britains director of public prosecutions allen green asked 
greater manchester police to investigate their handling of the case 
that was so damaging to stalker who was then manchesters 
secondhighest officer 
no one involved in the greater manchester police should be 
involved in the inquiry except as witnesses protested cecil 
franks a lawmaker from mrs thatchers conservative party and 
longtime supporter of stalker 
home secretary david waddington the cabinet official 
responsible for law enforcement resisted calls for a judicial 
inquiry 
people are too prone these days to come up with conspiracy 
theories without looking at what in fact happened waddington 
said if mr stalker has a document which he feels is relevant i 
am sure he will produce it 
stalker said he would do that but only to someone with direct 
access to and authority from the cabinet 
the stalker story goes back to oct 27 1982 when irish 
republican army guerrillas killed three ruc officers in an ambush 
with a land mine 
on nov 11 1982 three suspects identified by an informer were 
shot to death by special branch officers on nov 24 the same unit 
killed one man and wounded another near a hay barn where police 
believed the mine that killed their colleagues had been stored 
on dec 12 two more suspects were killed by the same special 
branch unit 
the ira admitted that the first three men killed were its 
volunteers and the irish national liberation army an ira 
splinter claimed the last two 
no terrorist connection however was made to michael tighe 17 
who was killed at the hay shed 
facing a storm of accusations that the ruc had a 
shoottokill policy chief constable sir john hermon appointed 
stalker in march 1984 to conduct an independent investigation 
stalker has said he admired the courage of many ruc officers and 
sympathized with their difficulties in battling terrorism but he 
was appalled by the slapdash quality of the rucs own 
investigations of the killings 
his most piquant discovery was that police and army intelligence 
had been bugging the hay shed when tighe was killed 
stalker pressed hermon for access to the tape and for more 
information about the use of informers 
i was within a couple of days of obtaining the vital tape 
and of being allowed to question hermon when he was told that he 
was himself under investigation for alleged involvement with 
criminals stalker wrote in his book on the affair stalker was 
formally suspended in june 1986 
he was reinstated as deputy chief constable within 10 weeks but 
the investigation was completed by another officer who recommended 
prosecution of some ruc officers 
attorney general sir patrick mayhew ultimately decided against 
prosecution citing national security 
last year 18 ruc officers were disciplined for minor offenses 
related to the case hermon has retired

the 46nation organization of 
islamic conference on sunday condemned a tunisian professor for 
writing a comic book version of the koran the moslem holy book 
hamid algabid secretarygeneral of the organization described 
the frenchlanguage work by youssef seddik as sacrilegious and 
heresy 
seddiks si le coran metait conte or if the koran were 
told to me was published in late december in paris where the 
author has lived since 1983 the book uses cartoons to illustrate 
verses from the koran 
seddik told the associated press in paris earlier this month 
that his aim was simply to make the koran more accessible to young 
people he denied he violated the tenets of islam 
his wife saida said in paris on sunday that her husband was 
out of town and unaware of the latest criticism of the book sold 
by alef for 10 earlier this month a professor of islamic studies 
in kuwait also condemned the book 
mrs seddik said her husband is completely flabbergasted by 
the reaction the book is written by someone who believes in 
islam and who did not seek in any way to commit heresy she said 
i dont understand why the islamic leaders have focused with such 
bitterness on the comic books 
the statement by the organization of islamic conference said 
the oic strongly reproves and condemns this series of 
publications as well as the publicity accorded to it 
the group headquartered in jiddah urged all member states and 
islamic organizations and associations to remain vigilant against 
such pernicious acts which it charged were aimed at 
undermining the islamic faith 
by indulging in a sacrilegious act which breaches the 
authenticity of the holy koran the author of these series of 
cartoons has committed an act of true heresy harmful to islam and 
moslems because it violates the sanctity of the holy book and the 
inviolability of what was revealed in it 
last year the group condemned salman rushdie the indianborn 
british author for writing the novel the satanic verses 
which the organization and many moslems around the world considered 
blasphemous 
rushdie went into hiding after irans ayatollah ruhollah 
khomeini called for rushdies assassination and iranian clerics 
offered a multimillion dollar reward for anyone who carried out the 
order 
tunisias highest religious body the higher islamic council 
condemned seddiks book jan 16 and said it contained profane 
images that constitute heresy it said the book should be 
banned 
mohammed faidallah head of islamic jurisprudence at kuwait 
university said earlier this month that seddiks book constituted 
a criminal act that ridicules the sanctity of the holy koran 
he branded seddik a new salman rushdie 
the organization of islamic conference promotes islamic 
solidarity and cooperation in the moslem world its members include 
indonesia egypt iran saudi arabia bangladesh and malaysia

of those 48 untermeyer said 10 or less were what you could 
call major donors including several who made the gops team 
100 by giving 100000 or more to the party for the 1988 election 
battle they included real estate developers melvin sembler now 
ambassador to australia and joseph zappala now envoy to spain 
many of the noncareer people are there for past proven 
loyalty to george bush said untermeyer but he said their ranks 
include such relatively poor people as evelyn teegan a former 
republican national committeewoman from minnesota who is now 
ambassador to fiji and sally novetzke a party activist and 
longtime bush loyalist from iowa who is now ambassador to malta 
sen paul s sarbanes dmd objected to several of bushs 
politically connected nominees last year and managed to block joy 
silvermans nomination to be ambassador to barbados she gave 
180000 to republican causes befor the last election 
untermeyer said the white house has not yet decided whether to 
resubmit her nomination 
the percentage of noncareer envoys is down from roughly 40 
percent at the end of the reagan administration to the current 33 
percent said untermeyer 
that was the goal that bush and secretary of state james a 
baker iii laid out at the start of the administration and it was 
achieved when bush decided to nominate a career diplomat edward 
rowell to be ambassador to luxembourg long a post reserved for 
presidential pals 
originally bush had nominated his chief campaign fundraiser 
frederick bush no relation to the luxembourg post but the 
senate batted that nomination back in august after frederick bush 
came under scrutiny for contracts he received from the reagan 
administrations scandalridden department of housing and urban 
development 
theodore s wilkinson president of the foreign service 
association which represents foreign service officers said if 
they hold to their pledge to keep a twotoone ratio theyre going 
to have to name career diplomats to the ambassadorships that open 
up for the next three years 
theyve filled about a third of them with party loyalists 
they dont have any left said wilkinson the noncareer 
appointments have been very uneven theres some very good ones 
and some very inexperienced ones 
by law wilkinson said even the noncareer appointees are 
supposed to be knowledgable about the history economics politics 
and language of the country they are assigned to some dont seem 
to meet those criteria said wilkinson 
with congress returning from a twomonth recess untermeyer said 
the white house will send up 30 nominations on tuesday 
some democrats accused bush last year of running a 
swisscheese government and taking too long to fill vacancies 
but untermeyer said only 5 percent of the 659 top jobs in 
cabinet departments and independent agencies were vacant all but 
25 of these 659 jobs also require senate confirmation

vermonts gubernatorial election is 
months away but analysts are already excited about the possibility 
of a threeway race involving three nationally recognized 
politicians 
bernard sanders burlingtons former socialist mayor and former 
republican gov richard snelling are both leaning toward 1990 
gubernatorial bids the democratic incumbent madeleine kunin is 
expected to seek reelection 
it would be the super bowl of vermont politics said john 
franco the burlington city attorney and a close associate of 
sanders 
it would be the wildest gubernatorial race said sen 
douglas racine the senate president pro tem 
snelling is expected to announce his intentions this week 
sanders is planning to reveal his plans within two weeks kunin is 
not expected to make any announcement until after the current 
legislative session ends sometime this spring 
all three politicians have achieved national prominence over the 
past decade kunin the states first woman governor has taken 
strong stands on the environment and abortion rights sanders is 
well known for his eight years as the socialist mayor of vermonts 
largest city and snelling a republican is a former chairman of 
the national governors association 
in vermont a candidate for governor must win a majority if no 
candidate does the election is decided not by a runoff but in the 
legislature this is precisely what happened in 1986 when sanders 
last made a try for governor kunin received 47 percent of the 
votes the republican peter smith got 38 percnet and sanders got 
14 percent the democratcontrolled legislature gave the nod to 
kunin 
at present democrats maintain a narrow edge in the legislature 
kunin now in her third twoyear term has seen her support slip 
in recent months as the states economy has slowed prompting her 
to call for budget cuts and tax increases some also oppose her 
calls for such measures as a ban on disposable diapers 
snelling who served as governor from 1977 to 1985 has been 
urged to run by republicans who feel he is the gops best chance of 
winning back the office the former governor said he will run if 
i find that i can contribute to solving the problems that are out 
there 
sanders who stepped down as mayor last year considers himself 
a socialist but runs as an independent he gained new credibility 
when he ran a strong second ahead of the democratic candidate 
former house majority leader paul poirier in the 1988 race for the 
us house 
poirier said sanders shouldnt be underestimated adding 
bernie made a believer out of me 
franco said you can safely say bernard sanders will be a 
statewide candidate in 1990 but added i can tell you he has 
not made up his mind about running for congress or governor 
sanders was out of town late last week and could not be reached 
for comment 
kunin supporters say that a challenge from snelling alone would 
not force the governor out of a race madeleine kunin doesnt 
walk away from fights said her former press spokesman robert 
sherman 
but the entry of both snelling and sanders would dramatically 
alter the political reality it would be a very tough race for 
her poirier said all three of them would start out as 
equals 
a snellingsanderskunin race starts out with the advantage 
going to the republican said peter welch a democrat and a 
former state senate leader who said sanders and kunin would split 
the progressive vote 
elizabeth bankowski kunins former chief of staff disagreed 
dont ever underestimate madeleine kunins ability to rise to 
the occasion she said 
snelling who might face a republican primary challenge from 
michael bernhardt would be the first former vermont governor to 
try to regain the office since erastus fairbanks did so in 1860 
his greatest task would be to persuade voters he has a vision for 
the state in the 1990s 
bankowski revealed kunins slant on a snelling candidacy i 
dont think thats what the governor meant when she called on 
vermonters to do more recycling

the body of ferdinand marcos mother 
was entombed sunday 20 months after she died ending a bizarre 
vigil by supporters of the late president who had hoped mother and 
son would be buried together 
marcos supporters used the entombment of josefa edralinmarcos 
who died may 4 1988 at age 95 to denounce the government of 
president corazon aquino 
about 1000 people including local officials gathered as the 
body of mrs edralinmarcos was placed in a glass and wood 
structure behind the marcos family home where she had been lying 
in state 
we dont want a political color to this ceremony said the 
rev domingo nebres who also officiated at marcos entombment in 
hawaii 
we want a loving tribute to dona josefashe is a woman who 
did not construct monuments that can be destroyed later but was the 
mother of a president who served us for 20 years to protect our 
country from communistic hands 
nebres recited a message from marcos widow imelda in exile in 
the united states thanking people in this marcos stronghold for 
accompanying my beloved momma to her resting place 
relatives said a refrigerated concrete structure will be built 
over the crypt next month to serve as a temporary tomb until mrs 
edralinmarcos can be buried permanently alongside the former 
president who died sept 28 in exile in hawaii 
after mrs edralinmarcos died marcos supporters demanded that 
marcos be allowed to return to the country for her funeral 
president aquino refused so the body lay in state repeatedly 
embalmed 
mrs aquino also refused to allow marcos body to be returned to 
his homeland citing national security 
marcos body has been entombed in hawaii but his family has 
vowed to bring it back for burial one day in his hometown of batac 
240 miles north of manila 
during the roman catholic mass before the entombment rodolfo 
farinas governor of ilocos norte province said there will be no 
political peace in the marcos strongholds until the former 
president is buried in the philippines 
they government are afraid of the fierce loyalties of the 
ilocanos farinas said let us stand up we will show them that 
we are loyal within the bounds of the law let us all join hands 
let us give them an assurance show them that nothing will go wrong 
if the body of marcos is returned here and show them that we can 
be trusted 
former national assembly speaker nicanor yniguez fighting back 
tears said the governments refusal to allow mother and son to be 
buried together was a sign of vindictiveness and vengeance 
several in the crowd wept during the ceremony others wore 
marcos campaign tshirts from the 1986 election that resulted in 
mrs aquinos rise to power 
after the vote a militarycivilian uprising forced marcos to 
flee the country 
marcos brother pacifico attended the sunday ceremony a sister 
elizabeth keon died in 1986 and another sister fortuna is in 
hawaii 
marcos father mariano disappeared during world war ii 
marcos was accused of stealing up to 10 million from the 
philippines during his 20year rule although the government of 
mrs aquino has not filed charges against him 
a lawyer representing the marcos family said sunday in 
switzerland that he has appealed a decision by a zurich attorney to 
unblock 260 million deposited in swiss banks by marcos 
after an investigation lasting more than three years the zurich 
district attorney peter cosandey agreed in principle jan 4 to 
unfreeze marcos assets in banks owned by the swiss credit institute 
and release certain bank documents but he said this was subject to 
the completion of criminal proceedings in the philippines to prove 
the funds were illegally obtained 
marcos lawyers have filed appeals at every level of 
switzerlands complex judicial system frustrating manilas 
attempts to obtain legal assistance to recover the wealth 
although the swiss froze assets held by marcos and his 
associates shortly after he was deposed only 213 million has 
been handed over to the philippines

the government sunday pledged to 
adopt democratic reforms regardless of whether they are supported 
by the communist party which was deadlocked in a key congress 
between liberals and hardliners 
communists from the liberal republic of slovenia urged that the 
party transform itself into a loose coalition of regional communist 
parties in this nation of six federated republics and two provinces 
such a move would radically transform it from its traditional 
centralized federal party structure and would significantly reduce 
the power of the national communist party 
but opponents warn that party unity is vital to the unity of 
yugoslavia which is undergoing its worst economic crisis and is 
beset by ethnic rivalries 
slovenian party leader ciril ribicic also urged the congress to 
immediately adopt a key document declaring the partys willingness 
to relinquish its monopoly on power and support free elections 
slovenian delegates are fighting over the issue of political and 
party reform with their hardline rivals in the largest state 
serbia 
regional party autonomy has been rejected by the serbians who 
favor a strong centralized party structure and want slower 
political change 
vice premier zivko pregl warned that the government would not 
allow the fate of the country to be decided in quarrels among 
people representing 10 percent of the population referring to 
the 2 million party members 
pregl said the proceedings at the party congress would not in 
any way influence the government 
on friday the government said it would present constitutional 
amendments to parliament scrapping the partys guaranteed leading 
role in society and lay the legal groundwork for free elections 
due in april 
pregl said the government would go ahead with these plans 
regardless of whether the party adopts the key draft document 
declaring its willingness to relinquish its 45year monopoly on 
power 
the party would in future only be relevant to the extent they 
succeed in elections he said 
discussion of the political reform document was forced into the 
background as delegates engaged in a bitter war of words over the 
future of the party a debate indicative of the deep split within 
the party 
slovenian leader ribicic said the yugoslav communist party 
should become an organization of independent and free republican 
communist parties 
only then can we compete in a multiparty system on an equal 
footing with other regional parties in the struggle for power 
ribicic said 
there is a deep split within the party between those backing 
rapid political change in conjunction with economic reforms already 
under way and those reluctant to fully relinquish the communists 
hold on power 
no one wants to break up an organization such as this when it 
is most necessary because of the upcoming democratic reforms 
said sonja lokar a slovenian party leader in an apparent attempt 
to allay conservatives fears that the slovenian proposal wiil lead 
to dissolution of the party 
earlier sunday serbias populist president slobodan milosevic 
reiterated his support for a strong communist party 
milosevic charged that those seeking decentralization of the 
communist party were calling for a war among yugoslav communists 
and a war among yugoslav nations 
we dont have a united communist party it is only a farce 
said slovenian delgate milos ciric we dont want to impose our 
liberal model on serbia and we will not allow serbia to impose its 
model on us either

a study by university deans released sunday 
predicts an intense tugofwar among government industry and 
academia for people with doctorate degrees 
as a result the association of american universities said the 
nations competitive stature can only weaken in comparison 
with other industrialized countries 
this nation faces a serious shortage of phds said the 
report a sharply increased demand will outstrip phd production 
before the turn of the century industry government and 
universities will be pitted against each other in a battle for 
critical human capital 
the report the phd shortage the federal role was 
prepared by a ninemember working group of primarily graduate deans 
from aau institutions it said the nation will suffer an annual 
shortage of 7500 natural science and engineering doctorates just a 
few years into the next century shortages of doctorate degrees in 
the humanities and social sciences will occur even sooner said the 
report 
faculty shortages already have appeared in engineering 
business and other highdemand fields the report said 
in 1985 an estimated 43 percent of all doctorates employed in 
the united states were working outside of higher education seventy 
percent of 1987 engineering doctorates had commitments in 
nonacademic sectors 53 percent in industry and 17 percent in 
government and other nonacademic sectors about 65 percent of 1987 
doctorate recipients in the physical sciences had employment 
commitments in nonacademic sectors 50 percent in industry 15 
percent in other nonacademic sectors 
across all fields 50 percent of 1987 doctorate recipients had 
employment outside academia said the report 
the report follows a study in september 1989 by the mellon 
foundation that estimated there will be only eight applicants for 
every 10 liberal arts faculty jobs by the year 2000 
it also comes on the heel of a call to higher education 
institutions last friday by education secretary lauro cavazos to 
increase by 25 percent the number of us college graduates 
completing doctoral programs in the basic arts mathematics 
sciences engineering and technological disciplines 
the current shortages have been somewhat masked by the heavy 
enrollment of foreign students in phd programs in science and 
engineering and by the desire of those students to spend at least 
some postdoctoral years in employment in this country said aau 
president robert rosenzweig 
we should be grateful for that fact but as many observers 
have noted it is a foolishly risky assumption for the future 
rosenzweig said the government has an essential role in 
assuring that the nations intellectual life and economic vitality 
remain healthily fed by successvie generations of talent trained to 
the highest levels of which our universities are capable 
the report recommended a significant expansion of federal 
support for graduate education and a doubling of federal 
fellowships and traineeships 
the aau is an organization of 56 major us research 
universities

a pregnant woman has been charged with 
child abuse after prosecutors accused her of excessive drinking 
drawing fire from civil libertarians who call the case 
unprecedented prenatal interference 
the womans attorney said such cases would encourage abortions 
but the county attorney said prosecutors shouldnt have to wait 
until a child is born with defects to act to protect it 
diane pfannenstiel 29 who is between four and five months 
pregnant was charged earlier this month with felony child abuse 
because her bloodalcohol level was above the standard used to 
determine drunk drivers according to albany county attorney cal 
rerucha 
the woman was under a judges order to avoid alcohol because a 
previous child she had was born with fetal alcohol syndrome 
according to court records 
if people are concerned with right to life then they dont 
encourage abortion by this kind of abusive prosecution the 
defendants attorney mary galvan said friday 
there is no law in the state of wyoming that makes it illegal 
for a pregnant woman to drink that makes it illegal for a woman 
of childbearing years to drink galvan said 
such prosecutions could only encourage women who have drunk 
alcohol to have an abortion to avoid prosecution galvan added 
according to galvan police measured pfannenstiels 
bloodalcohol level only after the woman came to the police 
department to report that her husband had abused her the next day 
rerucha charged her with child abuse said galvan 
the child abuse charge breaks new ground according to lynn 
paltrow an american civil liberties union lawyer 
thus far we have not documented any prosections for engaging 
in the use of alcohol during pregnancy said paltrow 
this case points to the frightening possibility of states 
creating prenatal police patrol this prosecutor is making up a 
crime 
when asked sunday if there was any precedent for prenatal 
prosecution of alcohol use rerucha replied i dont care if its 
precedentsetting all i care about is protecting one child in 
wyoming 
a florida woman was found guilty in august of delivery of 
cocaine through her umbilical cord to two of her children and an 
illinois woman was found guilty of child abuse because of prenatal 
drug use but neither woman was prosecuted until after the children 
were born 
rerucha had said earlier that there were cases similar to the 
one he brought in ohio and new york and while he said all cases 
differ in the details most of the cases were brought after the 
child was born he did not elaborate on whether the cases related 
to alcohol or drug use 
the complaint rerucha filed against pfannenstiel charges that 
during october november december and january the woman 
recklessly inflicted injury on an unborn child by 
repeatedly consuming alcohol in an excessive amount which she 
knows will cause serious physical injury upon her unborn child a 
preliminary hearing is scheduled feb 1

prime minister vp singh said sunday his 
government will scrap the 470 million settlement reached with 
union carbide over the bhopal gas leak and will pursue criminal 
charges and the 3 billion originally sought 
we believe there can be no deal over human corpses singh 
told survivors of the 1984 disaster which killed more than 3500 
people 
the settlement was accepted last year by the indian supreme 
court and by singhs predecessor rajiv gandhi 
singh was greeted by surging crowds when he arrived at the 
jaiprakash nagar shantytown where many of the victims of the gas 
leak lived 
some people draped garlands of flowers around singhs neck or 
knelt to touch his feet as he walked through the narrow lanes of 
huts just across the street from the nowclosed union carbide plant 
at a public rally attended by an estimated 100000 people 
onetenth of bhopals population singh declared we have decided 
to do away with the settlement and pursue the 3 billion suit 
against the company and also the criminal suit against ucc union 
carbide corp officials 
he promised that his government would provide interim relief to 
all people living in gasaffected areas the amount of money to be 
paid will be determined within one month he said 
we must look at the bhopal gas tragedy as a national disaster 
and involve all organizations to provide succor to the survivors 
said singh who took office dec 2 
the prime minister did not spell out how his government would 
revive the legal case in the worlds deadliest industrial disaster 
the supreme court the highest in the nation on feb 15 
accepted a 470 million deal as full and final settlement of 
the governments suit which had been dragging through a maze of 
indian court procedures for about four years 
the gandhi government originally sought 3 billion in damages 
and later filed criminal negligence charges against top officials 
of the connecticutbased union carbide corp and its local 
subsidiary union carbide of india ltd 
when union carbide and the gandhi government agreed on the 470 
million the indian supreme court absolved the company of further 
civil or criminal liability 
however under indian law the decision is subject to review if 
challenged gas victims and activist groups filed petitions with 
the court challenging the settlement on two grounds that the 
gandhi government had no right to declare itself the sole 
representative of all claims arising from the bhopal gas disaster 
and that the compensation of 470 million was inadequate 
the supreme court declared dec 22 that the gandhi government 
did indeed have the right to be the claimants only 
representative 
the second challenge is still pending and the singh government 
announced jan 12 it would support the challengers 
union carbide has maintained the gas leak was the result of 
sabotage by a disgruntled employee at the bhopal plant the 
government maintained the disaster was caused by company negligence 
methyl isocyanate a liquid used in making pesticides leaked 
from a tank and turned into a deadly vapor when it hit the air dec 
3 1984 when most people were asleep 
many people died in their sleep or as they tried to flee in the 
choking white cloud 
according to figures compiled by the government of madhya 
pradesh state which includes bhopal the death toll has reached 
3598 about half the victims died immediately or within a few days 
of exposure to the gas the others died later of respiratory and 
other problems caused by the gas according to government records 
an additional 20000 people are still classified as injured

east germany averted a major 
nuclear power accident in 1976 that could have been as devasting as 
the one at chernobyl in the soviet union a west german magazine 
said sunday 
east german officials have not disclosed the potential 
seriousness of the incident der spiegel said 
the hamburgbased magazine said the incident took place in 1976 
at the sovietdesigned nuclear power plant called lubmin near the 
town of greifswald in northern east germany 
quoting a former engineer from the plant spiegel said careless 
manipulation of an electrical grounding system by one of the 
plants electricians resulted in a major fire that destroyed most 
of the cable network 
the fire disabled six cooling pumps for the block i reactor at 
the plant and five of six backup pumps were also inactivated 
spiegel said 
it was only through luck that one of the backup pumps 
functioned spiegel said explaining that the backup pump had been 
accidentally hooked up to the electrical system of block ii which 
was functioning 
if the one backup pump had not functioned a meltdown as 
devastating as the 1986 chernobyl accident could have occurred and 
would have spread radioactive fallout over much of northern 
germany sweden and denmark the magazine said 
spiegel quoting the engineer said that the east german army 
was called in to clean up the plant which was repaired and put 
back into operation four months later it did not identify the 
engineer 
the report which is to appear in the weekly magazines monday 
edition was provided in advance to other news media 
the april 26 1986 explosion at the no 4 reactor of the 
fourunit chernobyl nuclear power plant was the worlds worst 
atomic accident two workers died immediately of burns they 
suffered in the explosion 28 died shortly after the accident from 
radiation exposure and one died of a heart attack while fighting 
the fire 
the accident sent a cloud of radiation over large parts of 
northern and central europe leading to bans on foodstuffs from 
several countries

in iowa where they covet convertibles loathe 
telephone answering machines keep an eye out for extraterrestrials 
and pine for more affectionate goldfish the poll people are at it 
again 
if you could take one thing with you after you die what would 
it be asks the iowa poll an oftenirreverent institution that 
has been probing public opinion in its home state for 46 years 
the answers published sunday in the des moines register loved 
ones 19 percent pictures 6 percent pets and jewelry 3 
percent each and so on 
extraordinary elsewhere such tidbits are common fare in this 
tireless chronicler of the offbeat in iowa society we like to be 
a trendsetter in the area of goofiness said the polls director 
j ann selzer 
others are catching on just this month wcbstv in new york 
aired a special called the great american tv poll among its 
findings twentyone percent of americans think suspenders on men 
are sexy 
thats just the latest in september the los angeles times 
revealed that 8 percent of the drivers in southern california have 
fuzzy dice or some such ornament strung from their rearview 
mirrors and cbs news reported last year that 7 percent of 
americans believe elvis presley may still be alive 
a spokeswoman at graceland the kings memphis 
mansionturnedmuseum maintained that he died on aug 16 1977 
no matter in this informationsoaked age goofy polls are the 
latest rage and some of the nations pollsters boneweary from 
their labors in the fields of political prognostication love it 
i could defend the elvis question till the cows come home 
said cbs pollster kathleen a frankovic first she said theres 
currency people talk all the time about sightings of elvis 
second theres sociological illumination knowing that 7 percent 
of the american people think elvis is alive says something about 
this country 
what it says frankovic would not venture 
selzer similarly declined to draw conclusions about the 5 
percent of iowans who say they were personally affected by the 
death of british punk rocker sid vicious but she called that a 
wonderful finding 
from the very inception of this poll part of its mission has 
been to explore the soft underbelly of the iowa psyche she said 
in a recent interview we are fascinated with the whole idea of 
what being an iowan means the poll gives us a wonderful instrument 
for tapping into that 
iowans expect nothing less of their poll it was selzer who 
revealed how many of them have pink flamingos or other ornaments 
on their lawns 24 percent it was she who found that 65 percent 
of iowans prayed for rain last summer 56 percent prefer paper 
grocery bags to plastic ones 42 percent wish they owned a 
convertible 26 percent sunbathe 9 percent know what auld lang 
syne means old long since literally the good old days 
figuratively 
there is much more fortythree percent of iowans believe there 
is life on other planets fortytwo percent are annoyed by 
telephone answering machines eightyseven percent say its not the 
heat its the humidity 
and among those who keep tropical fish 40 percent wish their 
pets were more affectionate that one had a very small sample 
size i have to point out selzer said we couldnt resist 
however 
the los angeles times couldnt resist selzers finding that 11 
percent of iowan drivers have names for their cars i stole that 
question said la times pollster ia bud lewis because 
i liked it 
pilfering queries is an honorable polling tradition that allows 
for comparison of data lewis result eleven percent of southern 
californias drivers have names for their cars too in both 
states moreover betsy is among the favorite automotive 
monikers 
not to make betsy blush but lewis also found that 38 percent of 
southern california drivers admit having made indecent gestures 
toward other drivers whod made them angry 
more gestures may be on the way four percent in the la times 
poll had telephones in their cars and 31 percent said theyd like 
one but in the national great american tv poll 54 percent 
said it should be illegal to use a car phone while driving 
other polls drive for the bizarre the satirical spy magazine 
reported this month that 5 percent of the americans it had polled 
said they would sacrifice a finger for a big part in a movie 
some of them at least may find it hard to make obscene 
gestures 
for the more sober polls there is a serious side to offbeat 
questions they illuminate an aspect of the way americans are 
thinking in a way that normal straightforward questions dont 
illuminate said cbs frankovic these are the areas where the 
answers are not predictable 
the result is something fun something interesting something 
that you cant find out any other way said selzer a poll 
gives you an opportunity to take that snapshot of a little slice of 
life and people love to read about themselves

in a launch scheduled tuesday japan hopes to join 
an elite club in space technology by becoming the third nation to 
send a spacecraft to the moon 
if successful the musesa will be the first spacecraft to visit 
the moon since the soviet union landed the unmanned vehicle luna 24 
on its surface in 1976 the united states is the only other nation 
that has sent spacecraft to earths closest neighbor 
japan has advanced rapidly in aerospace in recent years 
although it was noted for its aviation technology during world war 
ii the industry was banned by us occupation forces as a result 
japan entered the aerospace field late 
officials of the institute of space and astronautial science or 
isas said the launch will develop technology needed for 
exploration of other planets including precise control of orbits 
and highefficiency data transmission from distant satellites to 
earth 
the threestage solidfuel rocket an m3s2 made by nissan motor 
co standing 92 feet tall will be carrying two satellites a 
larger mother satellite that is to orbit the earth and a smaller 
moon orbiter 
if the launch proceeds as scheduled tuesday from the kagoshima 
space center on the southern island of kyushu the musesa 
spacecraft will be sent into a highly elliptical earth orbit that 
will bring it about 10000 miles from the moon in its first 
swingby on march 18 
the craft is to release the smaller satellite just before 
crossing the moons orbit a kick motor aboard the smaller 
craft will propel it into a lunar orbit the institute says 
because the moon orbiter carries no batteries it will follow a 
path that will keep it constantly in sunlight during the first 30 
days to allow it to use solar power to send continuous data to the 
mother satellite on space temperatures and electric fields isas 
says 
meanwhile the larger satellite will continue circling earth 
swinging by the moon and collecting data on space dust and other 
phenomena isas adds 
this will be the 13th satellite launched by isas and the fifth 
use of the m3s2 rocket

the new boy scout handbook still tells scouts to 
be prepared and how to use a compass build campfires and tie 
knots but it also aims to help boys cope with life in the 90s 
the handbook the first in nine years features a 23page insert 
on the dangers of child abuse and drugs a new environmentally 
gentle approach to camping new rules to keep younger scouts 
interested new merit badges such as cinematography and color 
photos in place of the old illustrations 
the changes are part of a decadelong drive to modernize the 
80yearold organization and boost its membership which sagged 
from 48 million in 1972 to 31 million in 1979 but has since 
rebounded to 43 million 
we feel like as the nations largest youth development 
organization that young people should be given a knowledge and a 
sense of personal power that will help them in their own 
protection whether it be from child abuse or drug abuse said 
lee sneath national spokesman for the boy scouts of america 
unfortunately in todays society these are things that young 
people need to be aware of sneath said 
the new 10th edition of the boy scouts handbook as the book is 
officially known is due to be in stores late this month or early 
next month the book has sold in the millions since the first 
handbook came out in 1910 the last complete revision was in 1981 
many of the changes in the new book reflect revisions already 
made in scout practice for example child abuse and drug abuse 
along with problems such as hunger illiteracy and unemployment 
have been covered in scout brochures and programs for several years 
adults involved in scouting are glad to see the organization 
address child abuse like other youth organizations the scouts 
themselves have occasionally been infiltrated by child abusers 
posing as helpful volunteers 
i think its better for scouting that theres more emphasis on 
it said scoutmaster br heiermann who leads troop 445 in the 
dallas suburb of arlington 
it appalls me when i read news accounts that scout leaders 
have abused kids said heiermann and that abuse doesnt have 
to always be physical it can be verbal abuse as well 
one change in the scout organization since the handbook was last 
revised particularly affects the youngest scouts and is aimed at 
the 40 percent of scouts who drop out in their first year 
the old list of requirements for a boy to advance from the 
tenderfoot rank to first class a major step toward the highest 
rank of eagle scout had swelled to 9 typed pages that list has 
been cut to less than two pages and there is less emphasis on 
earning merit badges at this stage of scouting 
ive found that if boys get to first class in their first 15 
months of scouting then theyre more likely to remain in the 
scouts heiermann said 
another potential turnoff to some boys the scout uniform with 
long green knee socks and neckerchief has been supplemented with 
more contemporary knit shirts shorts and white athletic socks 
scouts may wear the casual uniforms on trips and for camping 
saving their dress uniforms for formal occasions 
such changes please one scout who did make it to first class 
level aj pierce a sixthgrader in irving the dallas suburb 
where the bsa is based 
pierce who wants to become an air force pilot someday and 
thinks his scout experience will help him reach that goal calls 
the new handbook really great and said the changes will make it 
easier for more boys to adjust to scouting 
sneath blames the enrollment slump of the 70s on the end of the 
baby boom and a sentiment against uniforms and organized activities 
the me generation is very much an antithesis of scouts 
which is very much a we organization he said 
sneath doesnt directly tie the resurgence in enrollment in the 
1980s to the organizations new focus but said theres no doubt 
scout leaders and officials have a better idea of what todays 
scouts want 
the requirements really werent a problem before sneath 
said but when you deal with 3 to 4 million youths on a regular 
basis you develop a feel for what theyre going through

tens of thousands of ukrainians joined 
hands sunday in a joyous commemoration of ethnic unity marking the 
brief existence of a united independent ukraine more than 70 years 
ago 
organizers of the human chain leaders of the popular movement 
rukh said it stretched from the ukrainian capital kiev to the 
western ukrainian city of lvov about 300 miles and involved about 
100000 people 
that could not be confirmed but in kiev block after block of 
the city center was lined with smiling ukrainians holding hands and 
waving yellowandblue national flags many greeted each other with 
long live the ukraine and raised three fingers in imitation of 
the republics threepronged crest 
the festive and officiallysanctioned chain with its theme of 
unity and pride displayed a more peaceful side to the awakening 
nationalism among soviet ethnic groups a day after soldiers smashed 
through barricades in the azerbaijan capital baku in a bid to end 
fighting between azerbaijanis and neighboring armenians 
rukh organized the chain because we felt the hunger for 
unity said vladimir yevorisky one of the movements leaders 
we needed to feel we are a people we are a nation united against 
the problems of chernobyl economic problems ecological problems 
and the party apparatus 
an april 1986 explosion at the chernobyl nuclear power plant 80 
miles north of kiev which killed at least 31 people and spread a 
cloud of radiation over large parts of northern and central europe 
was the worlds worst atomic accident 
kiev is located in the central ukraine and there was no effort 
to make the chain stretch to the eastern more russified part of 
the soviet unions secondlargest republic 
the chain appeared to be rukhs most successful show of 
strength a similar event organized by popular fronts in the baltic 
republics in august to mark the anniversary of the 1939 nazisoviet 
pact that led to their annexation drew an extimated 1 million 
people 
in kiev the crowd included children and old people as well as 
representatives of a wide range of groups including the 
handicapped hari krishnas and jewish refuseniks 
banners proclaiming for a united independent ukraine and 
the ukraine hasnt died yet flew alongside hundreds of 
ukrainian flags some boys wore pins that said this is our 
history remember it 
on jan 22 1918 amidst the shifting boundaries that followed 
the collapse of the russian and austrohungarian empires a central 
ukrainian council declared a newly united and independent western 
and eastern ukraine 
it lasted only a few weeks before it succumbed to bolshevik 
troops but rukh spokesman viktor linchevsky said its existence was 
nonetheless historically important 
when they created the republic the founders knew it was 
doomed to failure but they wanted a legal precedent he said 
official soviet histories traditionally have considered the 
western and eastern ukraines unification to have taken place in 
september 1939 when under the nazisoviet pact the red army moved 
into the western ukraine and took it from poland 
kiev authorities sanctioned sundays chain and a later rally 
showing far more willingness than in the past to cooperate with 
rukh rukh meetings frequently have been suppressed in kiev unlike 
in lvov which is considered the center of ukrainian nationalism 
rukh claims some 300000 members although past protests in kiev 
where its support is only lukewarm have drawn only several 
thousand people its official a strong prosecession faction

newspaper to read the comics but some area horses are getting the 
morning paper for an altogether different reason 
anne wolfe of the hickory hill horse center in mountaintop says 
she started using shredded newspapers to bed stalls for 25 horses 
about a year ago 
its comfortable she said newsprint is more economical 
than either straw or wood shavings she said 
the practice also benefits the environment ms wolfe said not 
only is the newsprint recycled by chopping or shredding but later 
it can be spread on farmers fields as mulch 
she uses newsstand returns and press overruns of the 
wilkesbarre times leader and the mountaintop eagle which she is 
given free said david daris the times leaders operations 
director 
the newspaper normally pays 60 to 70 per ton to dispose of

a group of progressive communists on sunday formed 
the first de facto faction in decades and said it will work for a 
multiparty political system 
a total of 175 delegates from throughout the country wound up a 
twoday meeting by creating a faction called the democratic 
platform activist and participant andrei koptyaev reported 
on saturday the group decided that if an upcoming meeting of 
their party leadership does not accept democratic reforms they 
will split off and form a social democratic party 
noncommunist parties are not yet legal under national law 
though lithuania and latvia have broken that taboo in recent weeks 
both baltic republics dropped their constitutional guarantees of 
communist supremacy and legalized multiparty systems 
soviet president mikhail s gorbachev earlier this month dropped 
his longstanding objection to alternative political parties 
saying it would be no tragedy if they cropped up in the soviet 
union 
the new groups platform calls for radical reform within the 
party so it can work in conditions of a multiparty system on 
sunday the group elected a 56member coordinating council 
including communist maverick boris yeltsin and fellow progressive 
parliamentarians such as yuri afanasyev 
both are also members of the interregional deputies group a 
group of parliamentarians who had considered but then dropped a 
proposal to proclaim themselves a political opposition 
the national communist party has already suffered one 
splintering the lithuanian communists voted in december to split 
off and form their own communist party favoring independence from 
the soviet union for lithuania 
the national communist party is scheduled to discuss major 
reforms of its structure at a congress in october 
the progressives are principally concerned with the means of 
selecting delegates to the party congress koptyaev said 
in the past the delegates have been chosen from the top 
ensuring continued support for the status quo reformers are hoping 
for free election of delegates by the partys rankandfile in the 
belief they will force further reforms throughout the communist 
party

gov joe frank harris called sunday for an end to 
racial demonstrations in the birthplace of martin luther king jr 
noting that the protests have cost taxpayers an estimated 1 
million this month 
enough is enough said harris press secretary barbara 
morgan the point has been made 
harris has previously objected to the cost of law enforcement at 
such events 
more than 2500 police officers and national guard soldiers 
lined streets near the slain civilrights leaders tomb saturday 
during a demonstration by four white supremacists led by richard 
barrett of mississippi about 75 signcarrying counterdemonstrators 
separated from the white supremacists by authorities jeered at 
barrett 
barrett then traveled to forsyth county northeast of atlanta 
where he and one supporter marched civil rights leader hosea 
williams and about 60 supporters also marched in the county both 
events were without incident authorities said 
georgia department of defense spokesman harry heath estimated 
costs for security at the atlanta rally at 500000 plus federal 
costs for the national park service personnel present law 
enforcement at a ku klux klan rally at the state capitol on jan 6 
cost taxpayers 500000 
heath said costs for such demonstrations would probably always 
be high 
when people put in for a permit we know how large the nucleus 
is going to be but we have no idea how large the 
counterdemonstration will be because they dont have to have a 
permit he said we have to prepare for the absolute worst 
cumming police chief wayne lindsey estimated security costs to 
his forsyth county city at 2500 and sheriff wesley walraven said 
county security costs may have ranged from 50000 to 100000 
saturdays rally came on the heels of the events surrounding the 
federal holiday honoring king jan 15 and was denounced by 
president bush last week during a visit to atlanta 
the governors spokeswoman called the national park service 
decision to issue barrett a permit to hold the rally in front of 
kings tomb unthinking and insensitive 
one of harris top aides contacted the white house twice before 
the rally to suggest that it be postponed to further separate it 
from king day activities she said 
on jan 6 more than 2400 law enforcement officers and national 
guard troops surrounded the state capitol for a ku klux klan rally 
a year after barrett led a march in downtown atlanta that turned 
violent as thousands of counterdemonstrators threw rocks and 
bottles at the group 
in january 1987 williams and a group of marchers were pelted 
with rocks and taunted by a crowd in cumming during a brotherhood 
march 
williams returned later with an estimated 20000 supporters in 
one of largest civil rights marches in the united states since the 
1960s

steadfast strongwilled women she played variations of that role 
for most of her 82 years 
the actress who died of congestive heart failure saturday left 
an unforgettable gallery of portrayals the guntoting annie 
oakley the sharpie who conned henry fonda in the lady eve

clan in the big valley the australian matriarch in the thorn 
birds and the imperious constance colby in the colbys 
miss stanwyck born ruby stevens learned survival as an orphan 
in new york citys brooklyn she was moved from one foster family 
to another and remarked in one of her last interviews i was 
always the kitchen maid cleaning up after the meals thats why i 
never learned to cook 
hoofing in nightclubs provided more lessons in how to survive 
and established her lifelong professionalism 
i was always afraid of being fired she said when you 
come from where i did and you can be fired at any minute this was 
before unions and you were responsible to feed and clothe 
yourself then you learn to be professional 
miss stanwyck carried those lessons into her film work she was 
adored by film crews who called her missy

never fell out of love with the handsome actor 
miss stanwyck never remarried i never came close 
the actress seemed to withdraw in her later years her career 
was the only focus of her life and when the roles grew scarce she 
became almost a recluse seeing only close friends like jane wyman 
and nancy sinatra 
although miss stanwyck was nominated for an academy award four 
times the oscar eluded her until 1982 when she was presented with 
an honorary one for her career

in the 1939 movie golden boy they remained fast friends until 
his death in 1981 and every year he sent her a bouquet of roses on

touches like trapezeshaped coats enormous puffy sleeves draped 
fichu or shawl effects and the occasional big organza bowtrain

artist above all but hes definitely become a couturier

east germanys ruling communist party on 
sunday expelled egon krenz the ousted leader who opened the berlin 
wall and lost its popular no 2 official in a resignation that 
could cripple the embattled party 
the communists rejected demands to disband but offered the 
opposition coresponsibility in the government until may 
elections abolished their claspedhands emblem and offered to 
change their partys name 
tens of thousands of anticommunist protesters carrying 
suitcases marched across the border from duderstadt to goettingen 
west germany in a symbolic exodus but returned later in the day 
west germanys ard television said about 60000 people were 
involved but police in goettingen put the number at about 25000 
wolfgang berghofer a reformer who was the communist partys 
deputy chairman resigned along with 39 other prominent members in 
his home city of dresden the official news agency adn said 
with deep regret for our country we the undersigned declare 
our resignation from the communist party and with this step we 
include the urgent demand that the communist party be broken up 
berghofer said in a statement read to reporters in dresden 
three breakaway communist factions are trying to establish 
themselves as separate political forces and government television 
said berghofers move put the partys future in extreme danger 
berghofer also said he and the others support the growing 
together of the two german states within the framework of european 
unity it was unclear whether he was specifically endorsing 
german reunification 
berghofer dresdens 46yearold mayor is credited with helping 
to head off a potential massacre of prodemocracy demonstrators in 
october he was the first official to call for a freemarket 
economy 
berghofer has been widely reported to be joining the opposition 
social democratic party although sundays announcement made no 
mention of such a step 
his desertion is expected to spark a further exodus from the 
party whose membership has plunged from nearly 23 million in 1987 
to 12 million currently 
in a twoday meeting that ended sunday the communists expelled 
krenz and 13 members of the ousted ruling politburo it rejected 
demands to disband but promised radical reform and 
consolidation and rehabilitated 47 east germans punished for 
speaking out against former hardline communist leaders 
krenz immediately appealed his expulsion becoming the first 
former top leader to fight back publicly a dozen former leaders 
were kicked out in december and nine are in prison awaiting 
corruption trials 
the official announcement did not specify a reason for sundays 
purge however the communists are moving to rid themselves of the 
last of the top officials associated with erich honecker the 
hardliner replaced by krenz on oct 18 after 18 years in power 
honecker was kicked out of the party in december and now faces 
an indictment for high treason other members of his government 
have been accused of corruption 
krenz seen as a honecker protege inherited the helm of a 
country spinning out of control thousands were fleeing daily to 
the west while others demonstrated for reform 
trying to stem the exodus and remain in power krenz opened the 
berlin wall and other barriers to the west on nov 9 and promised 
other reform but he was ousted himself after just six weeks in 
office 
prosecutors opened a criminal probe against communist finance 
minister uta nickel who becomes the first member of premier hans 
modrows coalition government to be accused of wrongdoing 
nickel is accused of having been involved in illegal 
payments in her former post as member of the state finance and 
price council in leipzig adn said it did not elaborate 
after an allday leadership session saturday the communists 
offered the opposition coresponsibility in the caretaker 
government but it was not immediately clear whether that included 
ministerial posts in modrows cabinet 
a masscirculation west german newspaper bild reported that 
east german secret police and army troops apparently were preparing 
a coup in case of another general strike by government opponents 
bild cited unidentified opposition sources in east germany 
aside from the report there were no other indications a coup 
was being prepared 
the newspaper said opposition groups will ask for control of the 
interior and justice ministries and that if modrows government 
refuses they will call for a general strike for wednesday

two of three city residents say the twisted case 
of victimturnedvillain charles stuart created new tension between 
bostons black and white communties according to a poll published 
sunday 
sixtyseven percent of the 400 people polled said the nationally 
publicized case had damaged race relations in the city while 27 
percent said it had not the remainder expressed no opinion or 
declined to comment 
public sentiment however was not so divided over other issues 
involving the slaying of carol stuart whose husband killed himself 
after being implicated in the shooting he originally blamed on a 
black mugger 
the poll published in sundays editions of the boston globe and 
broadcast by wbztv showed marked differences among the citys 
blacks and whites as to how police and mayor raymond l flynn 
handled the oct 23 killing whether they consider boston safe and 
whether they advocate a police stopandsearch policy 
nine of 10 black residents surveyed said they believe the city 
police department overreacted in its investigation of the stuart 
case while white residents responded by a 54 ratio that the 
police response was warranted 
flynn whom many black leaders have blamed for encouraging a 
blanket search of the mission hill neighborhood following the 
murder still retained support with a 68percentto20 percent 
favorable rating that reflected nearly even support from both 
blacks and whites 
among blacks 32 percent said they would be less likely to vote 
for flynn for governor because of the stuart case while 47 percent 
said it would have no impact among whites 19 percent said the 
case would have a negative effect while 68 percent said it would 
have no impact 
flynn is considered a potential candidate for governor this fall 
experts said the survey which had a margin of error of plus or 
minus 5 percent clearly indicated that the citys black and white 
communities had dissimilar views of the stuart case 
in question after question there is a clear and significant 
difference of opinion between blacks and whites about the case 
said pollster gerry chervinsky of krc communications research 
which handled the poll 
by and large whites believe there was an action that was 
perpetrated by stuart that duped everybody and that flynn the 
district attorney and the police department did what they should 
have done the black community doesnt seem to buy into that 
among other findings in the poll 
seventyfour percent of blacks polled said they believed 
police improperly persuaded witnesses to implicate william bennett 
a black man later cleared in mrs stuarts slaying that compared 
with 42 percent of the whites 
overall 57 percent of the respondents said they believe black 
suspects in crimes are treated more harshly than white suspects 
blacks by a 7to1 ratio said they believe black suspects are 
treated more harshly 
eightyfive percent of blacks questioned compared with 51 
percent of whites do not believe police administer justice equally 
in all boston neighborhoods 
fiftythree percent of blacks questioned compared with 25 
percent of whites said they do not feel personally safe living in 
boston 
fiftyfive percent of blacks and 49 percent of whites said the 
news media had done a belowaverage job of reporting the story 
although flynn retained a high favorability rating he and his 
colleagues district attorney newman flanagan and police 
commissioner mickey roache scored badly in their handling of the 
stuart case with the trios performance rated belowaverage by 
about 54 percent of blacks and 32 percent of whites

mongolias ruling communist party ordered a 
reduction in privileges for party officials and said some 
special health clinics and a hotel will be made available to 
workers the official tass news agency said sunday 
the report comes a day after a foreign source in the mongolian 
capital ulan bator said the communist government banned 
demonstrations in the wake of protests by a fledgling proreform 
movement 
tass said in a report from ulan bator that the communist partys 
ruling politburo approved the decree on cuts to party officials in 
preparation of a 20th party congress scheduled for november 
tass said the politburo decided to close a special food store 
and reduce the number of official cars 
the politburo also considered several issues pertaining to 
benefits for leading workers tass said 
it was decided to transfer special clinics to the ministry of 
health of mongolia and to transfer to the central council of 
mongolian trade unions a government hotel complex the news 
agency said 
hardline communist governments ousted in eastern europe last 
year were criticized for providing lavish perks to party officials 
the foreign source contacted by telephone in ulan bator said 
saturday that the city council placed a temporary ban on 
demonstrations in squares main streets factories and key 
enterprises 
the measure was announced on television and reported in 
newspapers friday the source said 
the ban came after three street rallies staged during the past 
month by the newly formed mongolian democratic union a group of 
intellectuals and artists advocating a faster pace of economic and 
political reform 
the ban was accompanied by a commentary in the communist party 
paper unen on friday that for the first time criticized the 
mongolian democratic union and some of its leading members 
the article said the group was pushing too far in its campaign 
for reform and was failing to listen to the advice of its friends 
and elders 
mongolia a nation of 2 million scattered across the vast 
deserts and grasslands of eastern asia between china and the soviet 
union has cautiously followed the lead of its patron state the 
soviet union in introducing glasnost and perestroika 
however the inefficient governmentrun economy still fails to 
meet many basic consumer needs and unlike in eastern europe there 
has been no challenge to oneparty communist rule 
according to a report by tass the mongolian democratic union 
claims a membership of 60000 it has spoken out against 
commandism the authoritarian methods of party and bureaucratic 
powers and demanded that yumjaagiyn tsedenbal mongolias 
autocratic ruler for more than three decades before he was purged 
in 1984 be put on trial 
foreign sources in the capital also said a small statue of 
stalin was stolen last week and another prominent statue of the 
soviet leader was splashed with paint vandals also threw paint on 
a statue of horloogiyn choybalsan the stalinist leader responsible 
for widespread purges during the 1930s it was not known who was

a tanker ran aground in a narrow channel 
in alaskas scenic inside passage spilling an estimated 57600 
gallons of gasoline the coast guard said 
the spill was not expected to cause widespread environmental 
damage because gasoline evaporates quickly coast guard and state 
environmental officials said 
the 400foot motor vessel frank h brown slammed into burnt 
island reef about 18 miles south of petersburg in southeastern 
alaska around 8 pm saturday said lt rick janelle in juneau one 
tank was ruptured but the leak was stopped by about 10 pm 
janelle said 
the canadianowned ship refloated itself about 830 am sunday 
around high tide said ed moreth another coast guard spokesman it 
was taken to nearby skow bay where divers found a twofoot hole in 
the hull 
the tankers crew measured the amount of gasoline left in the 
ruptured tank and found that 57600 gallons had spilled moreth 
said 
the spill is tiny in comparison to the march 24 exxon valdez 
disaster which dumped 11 million gallons of heavy longlasting 
crude oil into alaska waters exxon corp says it has spent more 
than 1 billion cleaning up the nations largest oil spill 
by late sunday the coast guard reported three light sheens of 
gasoline in the channel the largest a mile long none of the 
fuel is deemed recoverable a news release said 
that type of fuel does dissipate faster than most oil 
products moreth said we expect a lot of it has evaporated or 
has broken up thats what were looking for 
coast guard spokesman greg robinson said there were no immediate 
plans to try to remove the gasoline 
a private pilot reported seeing gasoline trailing a halfmile 
from the vessel but coast guard pilots described it as a thin 
sheen of unrecoverable gasoline on the waters surface 
the states crystal lake hatchery nearby wasnt threatened by 
the spill fish culturist bill davidson said at the salmon hatchery 
the spill isnt expected to pose a health risk to people in the 
area said barbara holian a spokeswoman for the state department 
of environmental conservation 
conservation officials were working with fish and game experts 
to identify sensitive areas and protect them with booms she said 
the spill occurred in the wrangell narrows a 24mile long 
channel amid the mountainous thickly forested islands of the 
inside passage which runs along the alaskan and canadian coasts 
between seattle and juneau 
moreth said there were no signs of wildlife damage 
the captain told the coast guard the accident was caused by a 
judgment error but didnt elaborate said moreth who didnt know 
the captains name the coast guard took blood and urine samples 
from the crew to test for drug and alcohol use 
bad weather prevented the coast guard from sending out a 
helicopter to inspect the site from the air moreth said three 
coast guard cutters were on scene however and their crews were 
trying to determine the extent of the spill moreth said 
the coast guards californiabased pacific strike team of spill 
experts arrived in petersburg to assist the cleanup he said 
the vessel has been surrounded by booms to contain any further 
leakage 
plans are to take the vessel to scow bay which is just south 
of petersburg moreth said well assess damage there 
the owner has hired divers to inspect the outside of the vessel 
and the coast guard will board the vessel to inspect the inside to 
see if any other cargo tanks have been damaged he said 
the owner has hired a tug and barge to remove what fuel remains 
aboard the tanker moreth said 
the tanker owned by white pass transportation of vancouver 
british columbia carries 18 million gallons of mixed fuels 
including diesel oil stove oil and gasoline 
the wrangell narrows is a windy channel of water about 18 miles 
long that connects petersburg with larger bodies of water in the 
inside passage

the countdown toward a crucial parliamentary 
election started monday as a new legislative session opened and 
politicians began consultations expected to lead to nationwide 
voting on feb 18 
the election will be critical in showing whether the 
longgoverning liberal democrats can retain voter loyalty in spite 
of a series of scandals and public dislike of a new sales tax that 
forced two prime ministers out of office last year 
emperor akihito officially opened a joint session of the upper 
house of councillors and the more powerful house of 
representatives but on wednesday prime minister toshiki kaifu is 
expected to dissolve the lower house 
kaifu who has the final say on dissolving the lower house and 
setting the election date hasnt spoken officially yet but other 
leaders in the governing liberal democratic party have been saying 
for weeks that feb 18 will be election day 
the liberal democrats hold 297 seats in the 512seat lower 
house while the socialist party the largest opposition group 
holds only 85 a figure they hope to almost double 
if the conservative liberal democrats fall short of a bare 
majority of 257 seats japanese politics could be thrown into a 
confusing period of coalitionbuilding in which different parties 
attempt to group together with enough seats to take a majority in 
the lower house 
the diet japans parliament had been in recess since the end 
of 1989 while the upper house where the opposition had held a 
majority since last summer when the liberal democrats lost their 
majority for the first time in 34 years opened monday the house 
of representatives is not scheduled to resume a plenary session 
until wednesday 
it is expected that kaifu will dissolve the lower house as soon 
as it opens and declare feb 18 the date to elect new members of 
that house the upper house is elected on a separate schedule 
the election will come about five months early as the last 
election for a fouryear term was held july 6 1986 
opening the new session the emperor declared i hope 
earnestly the diet the highest organ of state power will 
completely fulfill its mission and meet the peoples trust 
akihito said japans parliament strives to improve the peoples 
lives and to spread peace and prosperity in the world

president hafez assad on sunday awarded 
lebanese president elias hrawi with syrias highest civilian honor 
the medal of merit after talks on how to end a rebellion in 
lebanon by christian gen michel aoun 
it was hrawis first visit outside lebanon since he was elected 
president in november 
government spokesman jibrane kourieh quoted assad as pledging 
that syria will spare no effort to provide any assistance the 
lebanese government requests to implement an arab leaguesponsored 
peace plan to end lebanons 14yearold civil war 
he did not elaborate but it was a clear reference to syria 
providing troops and tanks to help hrawi assert his governments 
authority over the christian enclave controlled by aoun 
the general refuses to recognize hrawi or his government and has 
branded them syrian puppets 
syria has an estimated 40000 troops in lebanon under an arab 
league mandate 
governmentrun damascus radio said assad also awarded medals to 
lebanons prime minister salim hoss and parliament speaker 
hussein husseini during the ceremony at the presidential palace 
it did not say why the awards were made but the three lebanese 
leaders head a syrianbacked government that has endorsed the arab 
league peace plan that shifts political power to the moslem 
majority 
the radio said hrawi hailed syrias brotherly position on 
lebanon and the cooperation between the two countries and thanked 
syria for the help it has offered to lebanon 
hrawi aide may kahaleh said hrawi and assad discussed how to 
tighten control of lebanons borders to prevent nonlebanese 
entering the country 
she did not elaborate but she was apparently referring to 
yasser arafats palestinian guerrillas who have reestablished 
bases in south lebanon and are sympathetic to aouns cause 
hrawi and assad also want to stop shipments of arms and 
ammunition reaching aoun who is bottled up in the christian 
enclave north of beirut 
aoun rejects the peace accord which gives moslems a greater 
share of power with the traditionally dominant christians because 
it does not provide for a complete syrian withdrawal from lebanon 
hrawi was elected in november shortly after his predecessor 
rene mouawad was assassinated in beirut only 17 days after he was 
elected

mayor charles luken puts in perspective the 
chapter 11 bankruptcy filing of federated department stores inc a 
corporate cornerstone here for 45 years by remembering how the 
city endured the turmoil surrounding another local institution last 
year 
it kind of reminds me of the pete rose gambling 
investigation people used to ask me whether it hurt the city 
luken said i used to say the citys bigger than that and i say 
the same in this case 
rose was manager of the cincinnati reds until he was banned from 
baseball for allegedly betting on the game 
now attention is on federated and allied stores corp two 
cincinnatibased department store chains that torontobased campeau 
corp placed under bankruptcy protection last week 
federated was founded in 1929 in columbus by the families that 
owned abraham and strauss in brooklyn filenes in boston and 
lazarus in columbus bloomingdales in new york joined the company 
three months later federated moved headquarters to cincinnati in 
1945 
the company has long supported community projects giving 
millions of dollars to charities and civic programs the federated 
department stores foundation gave 85 million last year to such 
causes as aids research and minority college scholarships 
according to foundation director pat ikeda 
ms ikeda said she didnt know whether the bankruptcy court 
filing would affect the foundation which is supported by an 
independent trust fund 
its possible that everything will remain the same she said 
nevertheless the mayor said cutbacks at federated and the time 
that financial problems have demanded from executives have 
drastically reduced the companys traditional prominence in civic 
activities 
they were involved in everything from the lowincome housing 
projects to being a primary sponsor of our bicentennial 
celebration in 1988 luken said i just dont call them 
anymore its not life or death but its a tremendous resource 
thats been lost to us 
another sign of the change is a part of cincinnatis skyline 
federated put its 21story headquarters building up for sale last 
week to raise money to service its 53 billion debt 
campeau corp went deeply into debt to buy federated in april 
1988 for 66 billion increasing its original offer by 24 
billion to win a bidding war with rh macy amp co of new york 
campeau had bought allied stores corp in december 1986 for 36 
billion 
many residents blame chairman robert campeau for federateds 
problems 
i think campeau and company took what was a viable company and 
really screwed it up said ocie hammond a manager at another 
cincinnati corporate heavyweight procter amp gamble co 
said luken i look at this as a glitch resulting from greed 
run amok of one individual who didnt care very much for the human 
suffering he occasioned on the people whove given their lives to 
the company 
the problem goes well beyond campeau himself though said john 
williams president of the greater cincinnati chamber of commerce 
i think thats simplistic hes the senior man but i guess i 
blame the whole phenomenon of hostile takeovers and the whole slew 
of people who profit from them at the expense of the community 
williams said 
hammond said he was disappointed that campeau found so many

mary cunningham agee has dropped out of the 
world of business and profits to pursue a goal closer to her heart 
helping young women make it through unwanted pregnancies she 
believes even abortionrights advocates can see the value of such 
efforts 
a decade ago mrs agee made headlines when she was forced to 
resign as a bendix corp vice president amid rumors of a romance 
with her boss william agee in 1982 the two wed although they 
both deny they were romantically involved during the time she was 
at bendix 
since she started the nurturing network almost four years ago 
she has helped some 800 middleclass single women have babies from 
unplanned pregnancies 
and as the nation marks mondays anniversary of roe vs wade 
the landmark 1973 us supreme court decision legalizing abortion 
she says people on both sides of the debate can be very much in 
favor of what im doing 
the nonprofit network marshals the resources of thousands of 
volunteers across the country to help single working women and 
college students get through the social stigma family denial 
financial difficulty and employer animosity caused by crisis 
pregnancies 
with all this great discussion about freedom of choice the 
irony was that the choice that was not available was not the 
abortion choice but the birth choice mrs agee said to me 
that was a galvanizing piece of information that continues to be 
missed in this very heated discussion 
the nurturing network gave me hope when i despaired early 
on wrote kate a 23yearold woman helped by the organization 
last fall when she faced the prospect of having to quit her job 
because she was pregnant 
some prochoice advocates question the motives of a group with 
an agenda so clearly opposed to abortion mrs agee 38 is a 
devout roman catholic 
i would wonder that the purpose might not actually be to help 
these women carry to term said jane johnson vice president of 
affiliate development and education for the washington dcbased 
planned parenthood federation of america 
however ms johnson said so long as womens rights to make 
autonomous decisions are not interfered with i have no problem 
with somebody helping them carry out their wishes 
mrs agees ordeal in the spotlight began when william agee who 
became bendix chairman and chief executive officer in 1977 hired 
the thenms cunningham and rapidly promoted her critics 
speculated that her advance up the bendix ladder stemmed from more 
than just talent and a harvard business degree although both she 
and agee stoutly denied romantic involvement 
she resigned as bendix vice president for strategic planning in 
1980 but her and agees problems didnt end there before she left 
the company the two drafted an aggressive takeover strategy that 
resulted in bendixs disastrous attempt to buy martin marietta 
corp eventually bendix was acquired by what is now alliedsignal 
inc agee left the company and he and mrs agee for a time formed 
a venture capital and consulting firm in massachusetts 
mrs agee launched the nurturing network in massachusetts in 
1986 after having a miscarriage which she says started her 
thinking about the desperation some women feel when abortion seems 
like the only alternative she moved the network to boise when her 
husband was hired as chairman and chief executive officer of 
morrison knudson corp in 1988 the couple have two children 
researching the issue she found that most women who have 
abortions are not underprivileged confused teenagers but women 
20 to 24 with at least a high school education 
many are goaloriented women working their way through 
college or pursuing a career unprepared to put their plans aside 
but unwilling to end a pregnancy 
with most assistance programs geared toward helping teenagers 
and the poor middleclass women in growing numbers have turned to 
abortion mrs agee said 
to make it easier for such women to avoid abortion if they wish 
mrs agee a fulltime staff of three and dozens of volunteers 
recruit physicians counselors families employers colleges and 
financial contributors to the nurturing network it has almost 
3500 members nationwide 
members are asked to provide medical care a job a temporary 
home or a change of schools for network clients mrs agee said 
the services are tailored to individual needs and many are provided 
at no charge 
mrs agee said many of the woman who seek help dont know about 
the bendix flap and most of those who do are unfazed by her 
notoriety 
her organization has tried to stay away from the abortion issue 
even as idaho lawmakers debate whether to enact restrictive 
legislation in the wake of last years us supreme court decision 
giving states some limited additional authority 
the nurturing network is not a forum for me to push forward my 
position on abortion mrs agee said my mission is not a 
political one but a practical one

negotiators for usair and more than 6000 
pilots have reached a tentative contract agreement following 27 
hours of talks 
the proposed settlement still must be approved by the airline 
pilots associations master executive council scheduled to meet 
thursday 
chris beebe the councils vice chairman said the panel can 
ratify the contract return it to negotiators for further 
consideration or send it to the membership for ratification the 
agreement was reached friday in miami 
its been a very very long drawnout process beebe said 
with this much time and effort invested to do anything hastily 
would be a mistake 
the pilots have been working under terms of a contract that was 
open for amendment on aug 31 1989 it is the longest usair pilots 
have worked without a new pact 
neither beebe nor usair spokesman john bronson would release 
terms of the proposal 
the lack of a contract had hampered usair from completing its 
merger with piedmont airlines from august through december former 
piedmont pilots flew only aircraft from that airline and usair 
pilots used only premerger usair equipment 
a transition agreement allowing crews to use planes from either 
airline took effect jan 1 
usair meanwhile remains locked in a dispute with the 
teamsters which is trying to organize some 8000 baggage handlers 
and ramp workers in the merged airline the national mediation 
board will count election ballots jan 30
