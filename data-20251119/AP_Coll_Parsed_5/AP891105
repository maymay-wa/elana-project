months earthquake and declared it tame compared to what they 
survived 
at least you always know whats going to happen with the giant 
dipper you come back to where you started and you can get back on 
if you want said diane rossi with an earthquake you just 
dont know 
mrs rossi and her 8yearold daughter teresa were among about 
1000 people who visited the citys boardwalk amusement park for a 
benefit for victims of the earthquake that struck the san francisco 
bay area oct 17 
the quake centered north of this seaside community measured 
71 on the richter scale killed at least 66 people and did at 
least 7 billion in property damage 
the 1924vintage roller coaster on white wooden trestles which 
is listed on the national register of historic places was 
untouched by the quake as were most of the other rides along the 
boardwalk including a carousel built in 1911 that also is on the 
register 
visitors paid 5 for unlimited rides on the amusement parks

students wanting to study abroad who must first 
take an englishlanguage proficiency test will have to provide a 
letter of permission from their department chinese sources said 
sunday 
it is an additional government measure to tighten controls over 
overseas study programs limitations were adopted after the army 
crushed studentled prodemocracy demostrations last june 
an official of the state education commission confirmed that a 
rule demanding such a letter of authorization recently went into 
effect he did not elaborate 
the sources said nonstudents must have a letter from their work 
unit or if unemployed from their neighborhood committee if they 
want to take the test of english as a foreign language toefl 
the sources said at least one beijing student had his request 
for a letter rejected by his department because he was on a 
problem list of students involved in some way in the spring 
demonstrations 
so many students want to take the toefl that some must hold 
places in line for up to a week just to register 
the test required by most universities in the united states and 
other englishspeaking countries that accept foreign students is 
usually given three times a year in beijing students are now 
registering for a january examination 
the government also requires a registration fee of 29 the 
equivalent of a months salary for most workers 
government officials have claimed there is no change in the 
policy of sending students and academics abroad but some spoke of 
necessary adjustments after the june crackdown 
most government scholarships now are going to older research 
students and scholars applying for shortterm programs it is 
virtually impossible for undergraduates to gain permission for 
overseas studies 
premier li peng said in september that those being sent abroad 
should be mainly visiting scholars and researchers because they are 
older and more mature politically 
the government is also said to be shifting foreign study 
destinations away from the west and toward socialist countries 
about half the 80000 chinese studying abroad now are in the 
united states many in the west have been outspoken in criticizing 
the government for the crackdown on dissent 
the number of students refusing to return to china is expected 
to increase 
last week the government moved to extend its monitoring of 
selfsupporting students abroad the least likely to return to 
china by announcing that such students must register at the 
chinese embassy or consulate within the next six months

of medical specialties announced from its headquarters in east 
lansing mich a date for a retest hasnt been set

emergency medicine were scheduled in arlington va atlanta 
chicago dallas dearborn mich los angeles philadelphia and 
san francisco 
the fbi has begun an investigation said joseph valiquette a 
spokesman for the bureaus new york office 
its just weird that a threat would be made at this kind of 
thing said john bogdan of the fbis new york office it would 
be synonymous with threatening to do something at an sat exam 
one of those threatened rebecca martin a waterloo iowa 
physician who had planned to take the test in chicago said she was 
shocked by the letter and disappointed because shed spent months 
preparing for the exam 
when i opened the letter i thought it was a hoax ms martin 
said have i been studying for the test thats probably the 
understatement of the year

to be canceled said dr don langsley director of the american 
board of medical specialties which oversees the 23 specialty

talks between the machinists union and the boeing 
co broke off saturday with a union official calling the aerospace 
giants offer to end the monthold strike and restart production an 
insult 
mediator douglas hammond said he decided to end the latest round 
of talks saturday afternoon but he refused to say what had 
happened no further talks were scheduled after sixth straight days 
of facetoface meetings he said 
hammond said both sides had worked hard to reach an agreement 
but ultimately they continued to agree to disagree 
boeing spokesman paul binder said the companys latest offer 
included bigger annual bonuses and reduced costofliving payments 
leaving the value of the overall package essentially the same as 
the offer the union rejected overwhelmingly on oct 3 
the latest offer also included a further cut in mandatory 
overtime a key issue in the strike binder said 
tom baker president of machinists district lodge 751 blasted 
the offer after emerging from the 2hour session 
this seems to me to really be an insult to us to bring us down 
here for six days bringing the hopes of our membership up he 
said 
larry mckean boeings chief negotiator said the company had 
made a great offer 
i believe the union leadership should act reasonably and take 
the offer to their members for a vote he said 
but union spokesman jack daniels said leadership wont present 
the offer for a vote 
its not an improvement on the offer of oct 3 and they 
rejected that daniels said 
both sides agreed before the days session began that the talks 
had reached a critical stage baker said they had discussed the 
issues about all we can now i think its time for some action 
hammond got the talks started after meeting separately with both 
sides last sunday 
the strike began oct 4 after nearly 58000 members of the 
international association of machinists rejected a threeyear offer 
with pay raises of 4 percent in the first year and 3 percent in the 
second and third years as well as bonuses of 8 percent and 3 
percent in the first two years 
boeings offer also included costofliving increases to 
virtually cover inflation a reduction in mandatory overtime from 
200 to 160 hours per quarter and higher benefits 
binder said the companys latest offer included unchanged wage 
increases and bonuses of 10 percent the first year and 4 percent in 
the second and third years mandatory overtime would be cut to 144 
hours a quarter by the middle of 1990 and employees would not be 
required to work more than two consecutive weekends he said 
the machinists represent 43300 boeing workers in the seattle 
area covered by district 751 lodge 12000 in wichita kan 1700 
in portland ore and a few hundred at scattered sites in 
california hawaii utah montana wyoming and other states 
the secondlargest union at boeing also is in negotiations the 
contract for about 28000 engineers and technical workers who 
belong to the seattle professional engineering employees 
association expires dec 1 
both sides say a strike is unlikely that unions lawyer dan 
mahoney said friday that daily talks would begin monday and he 
hoped to have an offer ready for a membership vote by nov 15

an underwater and aerial search for 97 
crewmen of a capsized us oildrilling ship resumed early sunday 
after divers worked late into the night but found no survivors 
company officials said 
the boat overturned in the gulf of thailand during the countrys 
worst typhoon in more than three decades 
we have no reports of survivors said a press release sunday 
from the company unocal thailand a subsidiary of the los 
angelesbased ship owner unocal 
a helicopter spotted the upsidedown hull of the 351foot 
seacrest on saturday but a search covering 600 square miles in the 
gulf of thailand failed to find survivors lifeboats or debris from 
the vessel 
the seacrest with members of 13 nationalities aboard 
including seven americans overturned earlier saturday as typhoon 
gay blasted the gulf with 100 mph winds at least a dozen fishing 
boats and two cargo vessels capsized in the storm local news 
reports said 
unocal lost contact with the vessel about 12 hours after the 
storm began whipping up thursday 
by saturday afternoon four unocal rescue ships and a helicopter 
had reached the area of the stricken vessel said carol scott a 
company spokeswoman in bangkok ships and aircraft of the thai navy 
and air force joined the search 
the vessel was about three miles northwest of the platong oil 
processing platform the platong field is 270 miles south of 
bangkok 
a helicopter dropped a twoman search and rescue team atop the 
hull 
they tapped on the part of the hull that is above water 
listening for a signal back but got no response scott said 
initially rescue workers had to battle sixfoot waves and 20 to 
35 mph wind she said 
thai navy divers continued diving operations around the seacrest 
using lights and remotely operated underwater vehicles 
earlier one of the unocal search craft rescued six thai 
fishermen who were clinging to their upturned boat without 
lifejackets after a separate accident scott said 
a drilling rig reaching 60 feet or higher was mounted in the 
center of the seacrest and the vessel was stacked with drilling 
equipment said barry lane a unocal spokesman in los angeles 
there was concern the ship might have been too topheavy to weather 
the storm also the crew had little time to prepare 
this actually was a small storm a squall and it escalated 
very quickly into a tropical storm and then a typhoon he said 
the official radio thailand quoted meteorological officials as 
saying the typhoon was the worst to hit thailand in 35 years 
the seacrest is owned by a unocal subsidiary and operated by 
great eastern drilling and engineering co lane said of the 97 on 
board there were 64 thais seven americans five britons four 
australians three filipinos three singaporeans two malaysians

the fbi says it will purge its files of 
thousands of names of people and organizations collected during its 
controversial investigation of americans who protested us policy 
in central america 
fbi director william s sessions disclosed the plan to transfer 
records of the bureaus 198385 investigation of the coalition in 
solidarity with the people of el salvador cispes to the national 
archives and records administration in letter to congress released 
last week 
sessions decision was hailed as a victory for cispes by the 
center for constitutional rights which had represented the group 
in a lawsuit that obtained documents disclosing the domestic spying 
operation 
in a separate case the national security archive a private 
notforprofit group said saturday that a new batch of fbi 
documents it received last week showed the agency ran background 
checks on people whose names surfaced during its library 
awareness program 
the fbi memo said the checks conducted after the library 
program was already under public attack were to determine 
whether a soviet active measures campaign had been initiated to 
discredit the controversial operation 
the fbi ran background checks on the more than 250 us citizens 
who protested the surveillance program to learn whether the 
protesters were backed by soviet intelligence services the los 
angeles times reported in its sunday editions 
beginning in the 1960s the fbi had asked librarians to watch 
for suspicious users and report them for fear that soviet bloc 
agents were combing the stacks for valuable technical data the 
times said citing fbi documents released saturday 
in 1987 angry librarians and others protested prompting the 
fbi to run background checks to determine whether a soviet 
campaign had been initiated to discredit the library awareness 
program according to one fbi memo 
a memo said all but eight of the 266 checks were either 
negative or of no significance to this study the names of the 
eight individuals who did not fit the negative or of no 
significance category were blacked out in the oncesecret memo 
made public 
the memo showing that the agency was looking into the origin of 
the criticism of its library program even while it was under media 
attack was among more than 1200 pages of documents turned over to 
the private archive group as part of a stipulation reached earlier 
this year in a federal court proceeding two other large batches 
had been turned over to the private group previously 
in the case involving central american protesters sessions 
conceded last year that the fbi overstepped its bounds by 
conducting domestic surveillance of political groups allied with 
cispes 
six supervisorylevel agents were disciplined and the senate 
intelligence committee sharply criticized the investigation which 
took place under former fbi director william webster now head of 
the cia 
clearly we see this as a major cavein by the fbi and a real 
important victory in the fight against surveillance said michael 
ratner an attorney at the new yorkbased center 
its a big victory for the fbi to finally concede they have no 
business snooping in these files that they belong in the national 
archives under very secure protection said ratner 
cispes also sued the fbi to force it to remove the names of 
innocent people from case files by transferring the records to the 
archives the group is appealing a federal judges dismissal of the 
lawsuit 
sessions disclosed his decision in an oct 27 letter to rep don 
edwards dcalif chairman of the house judiciary subcommittee on 
civil and constitutional rights 
transferal of the records to the archives will protect the 
thousands of innocent individuals whose names appear in these files 
even though they were not even suspected of anything illegal 
edwards chairman of the house judiciary subcommittee on civil and 
constitutional rights said in a statement friday 
this will ensure that the files will not damage someone in a 
future background investigation edwards said 
fbi spokesman milt ahlerich said the bureau has not settled on 
the terms of the records transfer 
it will take place after we are satisfied that the 
confidential relationships that the fbi had with citizens who chose 
to assist us in those investigations will be preserved he said 
in his letter to edwards sessions said any agreement negotiated 
with the archives would enable the fbi to continue to use the 
cispes files in pending litigation 
ratner said he would have no objection to that condition 
that would be fine if it can only be used for litigation 
purposes that would be acceptable assuming they protect the whole 
range of people who have been surveilled ratner said 
the cispes surveillance and infiltration that was conducted 
between 1983 and 1985 was based on tips to the fbi that individuals 
affiliated with the groups were linked with international terrorist 
organizations 
the senate select committee on intelligence in a sharply 
critical report last summer concluded that the investigation was 
based on allegations that should not have been considered 
credible 
sessions letter to edwards indicated that his decision to 
transfer the records to the national archives was in part 
influenced by recommendations from various congressional committees 
that the fbi files be purged of the material 
according to the senate intelligence committee report the 
cispes investigation resulted in the names of 2375 individuals and 
1330 groups being placed in the fbis central investigative index 
for easy retrieval 
the report found that the investigation had produced a total of 
650 volumes of investigative files containing a total of 24000 
names of people and organizations most of which were not indexed 
in congressional testimony last year sessions admitted that the 
investigation caused information on rankandfile members who had 
nothing to do with international terrorism to be included in fbi 
case files 
the fbi had previously purged its case files of material from a 
broad surveillance and infiltration of the socialist workers party 
from the late 1950s to the early 1970s

lebanese lawmakers elected parliament 
member rene mouawad as the countrys president on sunday and 
approved a peace accord defying a threat of attack by the leader 
the nations christian forces 
mouawad a 22year veteran of lebanese politics and a maronite 
catholic was elected president at a special parliament session 
that convened in syrianpoliced north lebanon 
the session got under way sunday afternoon with 57 legislators 
attending eight more than the needed quorum of 49 
the legislators reelected house speaker hussein husseini a 
shiite moslem who has held the post since 1984 for a oneyear 
term they also unanimously ratified a peace accord that was 
brokered by the arab league at a special parliament meeting last 
month in taif saudi arabia 
the accord is aimed at ending a 14year civil war that has torn 
apart this country 
the lawmakers met outside the range of the guns of christian 
army commander gen michel aoun who threatened to shell parliament 
when it initially planned to meet in beirut on saturday to ratify 
the accord 
the peace plan shifts political power to the moslem majority 
from the christians who were believed to be in the majority when 
the existing political system was devised in the 1940s aoun 
opposes the accord because it has no fixed schedule for a total 
withdrawal of the estimated 40000 syrian troops backing moslem 
forces 
husseini flew into kleiat from paris with 29 mostly christian 
deputies who had been staying in the french capital to avoid aouns 
wrath they linked up with 26 mostly moslem legislators who drove 
saturday from beirut 60 miles to the south and a 27th who flew in 
from geneva sunday 
the country has not had a head of state since president amin 
gemayels 6year term expired sept 22 1988 because parliament 
could not agree on a successor 
aoun who heads an interim military cabinet vying for power with 
a rival syrianbacked moslem government led by salim hoss branded 
the legislators approval of the peace accord last month in the 
saudi arabian resort of taif a breach of the constitution 
the general considers the syrians who control 70 percent of 
lebanon an occupying army and fought them for six months until a 
sept 22 ceasefire called by the arab league took hold 
by police count 930 people were killed and 2744 wounded most 
of them civilians in fierce artillery battles 
the taif accord increased the size of parliament from the 
current 99 seats 54 christian and 45 moslem to 108 to be evenly 
distributed between both sides and stripped the president of the 
authority to appoint and dismiss prime ministers 
but the agreement left the presidency with the maronites the 
dominant christian sect as it has been under an unwritten covenant 
dating from independence from france in 1943

police used steeltipped batons to 
break up a satirical street play held as part of an antigovernment 
strike sunday and at least 15 people were hurt witnesses said 
about 300 people were on a dhaka street watching the play a 
satire about president hussain muhammad ershad when police moved 
in and dispersed the crowd witnesses said 
the actors and audience fled in panic as police charged and at 
least 15 people suffered injuries witnesses said 
the dawntodusk strike the 61st this year was called by the 
bangladesh nationalist party and its allies to demand an end to 
ershads 7yearold government and to press for free elections 
no private vehicles were on the roads but a small number of 
rickshaws the traditional form of transportation for most 
commuters and some stateowned buses plied the streets under 
police escort 
the strike affected major cities across bangladesh including 
the southern port city of chittagong and the countrys 
thirdlargest city khulna said opposition sources 
there were no reports of major violence but police said 
students at dhaka university a hotbed of political unrest set 
fire to about a dozen rickshaws and cars that defied the strike 
in dhaka a city of 6 million people the strike began 
peacefully but paramilitary units and thousands of armed police 
patrolled the citys major streets in one of the biggest shows of 
strength seen recently 
the strike was backed by several opposition groups including the 
sevenparty alliance in which the nationalist party is a major 
component the party was toppled by ershad in a bloodless military 
coup in 1982 
ershad has dismised opposition demands for his resignation but 
indicated he would be willing to hold elections if all major 
political parties agreed to participate opposition parties 
however have refused to take part in polling under the current 
government 
in 1986 four years after seizing power ershad was elected to a 
fiveyear term as president in an election opposition parties 
charge was fraudulent 
as in the past the government ured citizens to ignore sundays 
strike and several progovernment organizations distributed 
leaflets and posters showing how strikes hurt the countrys fragile 
economy 
the government has said each strike costs this impoverished 
nation about 78 million 
bangladesh is one of the worlds poorest countries with its 110 
million people earning an average annual income equivalent to about 
150 
another antigovernment strike is planned by opposition parties

the promised land has failed to attract most of 
the new wave of soviet jewish immigrants but officials have 
created a 3 billion resettlement program in hopes of reversing the 
trend 
israeli officials want to lure 100000 soviet immigrants over 
the next three years a forecast many feel is optimistic this is 
because the new brand of soviet emigrants unlike those of the 
1970s are more interested in lifestyle than ideology 
israels message of jews come home does not work inna 
shapiro who immigrated 14 years ago and recently revisited the 
soviet union said on israels state television 
nobody asks if it feels good to be a jew in israel they just 
want a better life she said 
earlier soviet immigrants many ardent nationalists mock the 
materialism of what they call sausage emigrants those who 
seek quality food and goods that are in short supply in moscow 
mikhail chlenov chairman of the newly opened jewish cultural 
association in moscow agreed during a recent visit to israel that 
todays emigrants are different 
they are more assimilated their reasons are not specifically 
jewish he said mostly they are worried over the governments 
instability the spread of antisemitism economic crisis 
perhaps the strongest deterrent to immigration here is the 
experience of many of the 250000 who have settled in israel since 
1967 
their tribulations in finding good jobs and houses dealing with 
the tensions of the arabisraeli conflict and finding a place in an 
insular nativeborn society have filtered back to the soviet 
union influencing some future immigrants to choose the united 
states instead of israel 
israels media and society gave the immigrants of the 1970s a 
hostile reception economic incentives granted to new immigrants 
especially housing mortgages have constantly changed for the 
worse said yitzhak yuzefpolsky an electrical engineer who came 
here in 1974 
the emigration of the 1970s he said included outstanding 
scientists engineers and artists who have since left israel or who 
went directly to the united states because israel could not 
create the minimal conditions necessary for their work 
in an effort to make the jewish state more attractive the 
cabinet announced oct 30 a detailed program to build 25000 new 
housing units start vocational training programs create new jobs 
and open new classrooms 
amos rubin prime minister yitzhak shamirs economic adviser 
said israel will try to raise 1 billion in donations and loans 
abroad mostly from jews in the united states to go with the 2 
billion it plans to provide in israel 
barring an unexpected flood of immigrants he said israel would 
not seek new us government aid now 3 billion a year israel 
would however ask for us guarantees to underwrite a bond issue 
to raise 400 million for private housing 
where the immigrants will be settled is a major issue 
one controversial plan by absorption minister yitzhak peretz 
calls for channeling the flow to rundown development towns in 
remote areas where factories are closing and unemployment is high 
another proposal put forward by yitzhak david shamirs adviser 
on jewish affairs recommends soviet jews be settled in the 
occupied west bank and gaza strip 
liberal critics argue the plan would deter soviet jews who did 
not want to be thrust into the midst of the palestinian revolt and 
would complicate relations with washington the us administration 
has announced it would reject any effort to help settle immigrants 
in the occupied territories 
so far the effort to attract soviets has been a stinging 
failure in the first 10 months of this year 7275 out of 51080 
soviet jewish emigrants came to israel according to uri gordon a 
senior official in the quasigovernmental jewish agency 
he said 284550 of the 25 million soviet jews have requested 
sponsors abroad so far this year he predicts half will come here 
the united states where 162000 soviet jews have settled in the 
past two decades has become the main magnet for soviet emigrants 
businessmen from the united states told me that soviet jews 
have created many jobs there and in israel they only say that we 
take jobs from others said vladimir lifschitz who arrived two 
years ago after a long battle with soviet authorities to get an 
exit visa 
some israeli officials see hope for an increase in immigration 
to israel as a result of new us immigration restrictions that 
have put a ceiling of 50000 soviet refugees next year 
but activists say an influx should not be taken for granted 
they think the jews will come here of their own just 
because of the economic instability and antisemitism there and the 
closing doors in the united states natan sharansky an immigrant 
rights activist told the jerusalem post 
sharansky a dissident freed in 1986 after nine years in soviet 
labor camps said im very much afraid that after the first 
10000 to 15000 come there will be a catastrophe apartment 
prices will rise there will be fewer jobs the old absorption 
problems will surface anew 
israels absorption ministry is currently financing jobs for 
some 350 immigrant scientists and engineers but officials say they 
are unable to handle any more cases in addition 100 scientists 
from the soviet union and romania are here looking for work and 50 
others are in the soviet union awaiting word on job openings 
one soviet scientist who visited israel recently as a tourist 
said he abandoned emigration plans after consulting with soviets 
who had immigrated earlier 
i found out i could practice psychiatry but would have to give 
up decades of research in neurology said the scientist who 
spoke on condition of anonymity i could continue my work in the 
united states but for that i would not emigrate

a goldplated clock in a darkened hall 
of a government hospital quietly ticks it isnt marking time but 
the number of indian babies born 
after a minute the clock hits 50 within an hour 3000 by 
days end 72000 babies are born 70000 of them survive at the 
years end 17 million 
its like adding another australia said ashish bose a 
population expert and outspoken critic of the health and family 
welfare ministry the godfather of indias birth control program 
ironically india was the among the first to launch a 
governmentsponsored family planning program since 1951 when the 
program was set up the government has tried almost everything to 
check population growth from cafeterialike clinics distributing 
contraceptives to coercion during the 197577 state of emergency 
more than 18 billion has been pumped into family planning 
programs in the past decade three times the amount of the previous 
30 years but indias population has still mushroomed to 880 
million and the rapidly multiplying numbers are the single biggest 
factor inhibiting economic and social development 
according to government demographers indians average annual 
population growth peaked in 1981 at 225 percent and has since 
declined to 212 percent 
but even at the current rate the governments planning 
commission predicted indias population will hit 1 billion by the 
turn of the century and rise to 17 billion by the year 2035 
probably surpassing china as the worlds most populous country 
already india is twice as densely populated as china which has 
12 billion people the pressure is intolerable on the environment 
cities and basic services like water and electricity 
earlier this year the planning commission spelled out the 
dangers of unchecked population growth citing falling food 
production environmental damage rising illiteracy and 
unemployment and worsening social tensions 
such apocalyptic visions have little impact 
doomsday warnings dont go down in india because of their 
philosophy of life and what they have gone through said george 
walmsley of the united nations population fund 
family planning got a bad name in india during the mid1970s 
when allegations of forced sterilizations caused a scandal and a 
backlash that still lingers 
when prime minister rajiv gandhi took the helm in 1984 his 
government launched new programs with catchy slogans every year 
800 million condoms are distributed in india and up to 5 million 
men and women are sterilized but after five years there has been 
no sign of dramatic change 
opposition politicians trying to oust gandhi and his congress 
party in this months parliamentary elections have lofty proposals 
but shy away from discussing them 
talking about family planning is like singing the requiem at a 
wedding said one opposition lawmaker speaking on condition of 
anonymity if people dont want to adopt family planning and i 
force them then im finished 
the problems go much deeper than the lack of public enthusiasm 
and manpower to implement a comprehensive family program in 
ethnically and linguistically diverse india 
religious customs traditions and teachings in the 
hindudominated country reject the very concept of family planning 
most people believe the birth of a child is a gift from god and 
that to do anything against the natural course would displease god 
male superiority and the importance of a son also are factors 
i need two sons otherwise who will carry on the family name 
who will help me in the fields who will look after me in my old 
age and who will lift my funeral pyre said datta mal jain in his 
village in rajasthan state 
additional hands to work mean additional income for impoverished 
people who do not know how many of their children will survive 
one out of every 10 indian babies dies within the first year of 
tetanus diarrhea diphtheria or whooping cough 
improved health services and eradication of famines and major 
epidemics have lowered the countrys overall mortality rate the 
average indian now lives to the age of 58 compared with 32 when 
india became independent from britain in 1947 
but overall statistics disguise huge differences between regions 
the southern state of kerala where literacy and womens status 
are high has the lowest growth rate in the country at 153 
percent while northern haryana state is the highest at 256 
bihar uttar pradesh and rajasthan in the north and madhya 
pradesh in central india also have exploding populations coupled 
with some of the countrys worst poverty and social conditions 
indias social and religious traditions subordinating women are 
strongest in these states infant mortality is high female 
literacy employment and marriage age are low and acceptance of 
family planning is poor 
before the sterilization scandal 80 percent of operations were 
carried out on men today 80 percent are on women 
male vasectomies are quicker safer and cheaper than female 
sterilization but men have passed the buck and sensitivities over 
the past mean the issue is not forced bose said 
we have to find a way to play god but do it soberly he said

he wielded power like a monarch the 
prosecutors say arrogantly ruling over his fiefdom in the 
foothills of the allegheny mountains and threatening retribution 
against all who crossed him 
but on monday judge joseph okicki will sit in an unaccustomed 
position in a courtroom at the defendants table the man who 
personified the law in rural cambria county is now charged with 
violating it through bribery and extortion 
okickis trial has been the talk of central pennsylvania a 
fixture on the nightly television news and the local newspapers at 
times it has verged on soap opera with allegations that the judge 
ordered secretaries to take dictation while he was in his 
underpants or naked and that he ordered court workers to chop his 
wood and feed his dogs 
acting with okickis approval his friends paid for a fourpage 
insert in a weekly shopper last week that portrays the judge as the 
victim of a sensationhungry news media and witchhunting state 
police 
it took a week to pick the jury for the suspended cambria county 
judge and he now insists he cannot get a fair trial even with 
those selected 
most of the people who came in there had a fixed opinion 
the graybearded 59yearold okicki said last week while standing 
outside a central cambria high school classroom used to interview 
jurors 
its certainly true that feelings run high although many in the 
local legal community are afraid to discuss him 
there was just a tremendous element of fear that pervaded the 
courthouse said one attorney who like many of his colleagues 
spoke on condition of anonymity you never knew from one day to 
the next whether you were his enemy or friend 
if you go against the judge he can make it miserable for 
you said attorney edward peduzzi who is semiretired he can 
make a good case a bad case 
last march less than a year after okickis swearingin as 
president judge of a fivemember court a state grand jury 
recommended he be charged with 13 years worth of violations 
including extortion bribery lewdness and coercion 
according to the 80page presentment okicki peddled his 
influence so widely and frequently that he even had his secretaries 
prepare letters outlining his extortion demands and sent out staff 
members to solicit kickbacks 
such letters were indicative of judge okickis apparent 
belief that in his official capacity he was justified in granting 
favors to those who came before him concerning official 
matters the grand jury wrote 
among the lesser charges are allegations that he used courthouse 
employees to perform personal chores for him and his family 
more serious charges accuse okicki of writing to laurel bank 
which had a request pending before him on an estate case demanding 
that the bank lower the 145 percent interest rate on a personal 
loan he had taken out 
perhaps if my personal matters can be resolved with laurel 
bank in the near future i may be inclined to reconsider your 
request said the letter composed on courthouse stationery 
the bank cut the rate to 11 percent 
okicki claims he was merely informing bank officials that he 
would have a hard time being unbiased while the bank remained his 
personal adversary 
the grand jury also accused okicki of forcing his bailiff to 
pay 500 for a promotion that never occurred and of accepting at 
least 500 from attorney richard green who told the grand jury he 
feared retaliation from a judge who was known to be always in 
need of money 
the judge also must defend himself on charges stemming from two 
incidents in which he allegedly called his secretaries into his 
chambers once wearing nothing but bikini underwear and once 
wearing nothing at all 
in his newspaper insert okicki promised that other info 
involving the secretaries will come out at trial 
local attorneys say that despite the preponderance of charges 
okicki will be a formidable opponent for the state prosecutor 
he graduated near the top of his class at the university of 
pittsburgh law school and is known for a keen mind and a 
photographic memory 
he was elected to his first 10year term as a judge in 1971 and 
reelected in 1981 in 1983 he was voted president of the 
pennsylvania conference of state trial judges by the states 400 
judges 
although the grand jury recommended 76 charges most of those 
have been dismissed withdrawn or combined with other charges 
twentyseven remain 11 of which involve public corruption and 16 
of which involve more private charges 
okickis trial on monday concern only the first 11 he will be 
tried on the others later 
the judge insists he will return to the bench if he can get a 
fair trial 
this is the system i have practiced in that i have been a 
teacher and a judge in and to which ive devoted my entire adult 
life he said 
i feel in my heart and my mind that i shall be back that i 
shall be vindicated in a court of law

peasants in the fertile region 
around this mountain town in contra territory are unabashedly 
antigovernment 
president daniel ortegas lifting of a 19month ceasefire last 
week with the contra rebels apparently has not changed their minds 
i dont know about what mr ortega said said one 
60yearold farmer sitting in front of his tworoom house with 
some friends but you remember what they called him in costa 
rica this little man 
the farmer and his friends broke out in smiles amused at 
president bushs scornful description of ortega at a summit of 
western hemisphere leaders last month 
the farmers response showed a defiance typical of many peasants 
in this part of central matagalpa province procontra peasants 
feed the guerrillas and provide information about troop movements 
but they arent foolhardy asked for his name and permission to 
take his picture the farmer demurred better not its not 
good he said 
this farmer has a few cattle and grows corn and beans like most 
people in this rich agricultural region known for its dairy 
products 
hes not happy with 10 years of government by the leftist 
sandinistas the economy is in shambles and the young men needed 
in the fields are drafted for two years when they turn 16 
the war that began in 1981 and went into a lull for 19 months is 
now starting again and fighting means trouble in the daily lives 
of the peasants in this region whatever their political 
convictions 
now nobody buys from us theres no money he said his 
friends nodding in agreement ive gone to the bank to cash a 
check and they tell me theres no money 
me i was born here and here i stay but my boy they grabbed 
him for military service and he deserted now hes in costa rica 
i want him to stay there the man said of his 20yearold son 
the man lives a few miles from rio blanco in the middle of 
nicaragua and of a corridor the contras use to slip across the 
honduran border and head south 
most rebels left for honduras after signing the truce with the 
sandinista government in march 1988 
the attitude of this farmer and others like him is what has 
allowed other contras to survive inside nicaragua so long 
about 2500 rebels stayed behind and over the past few weeks 
about 4000 more have come back into nicaragua from their honduran 
jungle camps 
ortega said their return had been marked by bolder and more 
numerous attacks 
the sandinista peoples army is faced with fighting an elusive 
enemy in mountainous territory where many of the natives favor the 
insurgents 
they have deployed thousands of troops armed with chinesemade 
ak47 rifles machine guns grenade launchers and mortars the 
government also has sent special antiinsurgency units from the 
ministry of the interior 
they contras have 20 months in which we havent rammed them 
with a strong offensive said capt daniel jiron military head 
in this area maybe theyve kidded themselves that we lack the 
conditions to do so 
we have spent these 20 months preparing our forces he said 
for the peasants in this area 140 miles from managua the war 
never ended 
we have a great problem one peasant said the 
sandinista troops sleep here and the others contras pass by 
here and i have my family here 
the sandinistas may eventually win the battle with the contras 
but after 10 years in power they still havent captured the hearts 
of many peasants as the country prepares for feb 25 elections 
only i know what im going to put on my ballot the 
60yearold farmer said 
i didnt go to school and i dont know how to write i use 
this as my signature he said showing a calloused thumb but i 
wasnt born mute or blind i can see very clearly what i want

as he sat in his emigre daughters comfortable 
apartment gen ivan d yershov recounted how people screamed 
occupiers at the soviet troops he led into czechoslovakia in 
1968 to crush the effort to liberalize that nations communist 
regime 
we were told that we were going in at the request of the 
czechoslovakian leadership to protect socialism because 
counterrevolutionaries were preparing to take over and it was not 
excluded that the west would intervene yershov said 
yershov said he was shocked when his troops were not greeted as 
heroes 
i had doubts on the morning of aug 21 when i saw that the 
czech people were unhappy that we had come said yershov they 
screamed at us you are occupiers 
eleven years later the soviet invasion of afghanistan 
intensified those doubts 
his faith in the communist system broke entirely when his 
daughter went on a hunger strike in 1982 to win permission to join 
her husband and daughter in the united states 
that was a different time before mikhail gorbachev before 
perestroika regimes at least as liberal as the one yershov helped 
remove in prague are springing up all over eastern europe indeed 
in moscow itself 
the retired generals soninlaw now travels freely between 
washington and moscow where he is trying to establish an american 
university 
but only seven years ago when yershov won permission for his 
daughter tatyana lozansky to leave the soviet union the fight 
cost him his privileged post as a threestar general 
now on his first visit to america staying in washington with 
his daughter and soninlaw yershov told the associated press that 
he believes more than ever that he was right to question the soviet 
regime 
and he says many former colleagues in the soviet armed forces 
support gorbachevs efforts to reform their country even if it 
means a smaller role for the military 
yershovs assessment while by no means conclusive was in 
contrast to the dour view of human rights activist andrei d 
sakharov who has warned of a potential military coup 
the army supports gorbachev most of the officers and men 
support perestroika the army takes orders as it did in 
czechoslovakia and afghanistan yershov said but the line of 
command is changing 
now the army is taking orders from the supreme soviet the 
parliament that is assuming greater power 
before the army was taking orders from the politburo the 
body of a dozen or so top communists that has run the soviet union 
for most of its 72 years 
the afghan invasion was decided on the politburo level two or 
three people such decisions will not be made again by a small 
group he said gorbachev was right to withdraw from 
afghanistan 
yershov does not believe the soviet military would object to 
withdrawal from eastern europe or a diminished role for the warsaw 
pact if us forces also withdrew from europe 
the countries of eastern europe should decide whether soviet 
troops should be on their territory they should decide whether to 
be members of the warsaw pact he said i know that many 
generals feel the same way 
if yershovs life has taken some unusual turns it was for many 
years typical for his generation he came out of world war ii as a 
lieutenant colonel in the soviet army 
he rose to twostar general by 1968 and on aug 20 of that 
year was deputy commander of the soviet forces that invaded 
czechoslovakia 
while yershov and others were surprised by the hostile 
reception they kept their feelings to themselves 
among ourselves we said that it was the rightwing 
extremists the counterrevolutionaries who had made this 
necessary said yershov we never expressed doubts among 
ourselves 
when soviet forces invaded afghanistan 11 years later the 
doubts grew 
i met with many of my comrades who said it was a big 
mistake said yershov 
jeopardizing soviet lives and prestige to support an unpopular 
government was unwise he said 
only a small part of the afghan people supported the 
revolution he said 
i wouldnt have said all this 10 years ago because i had a 
big family that i had to support and protect he said 
family became politics for yershov in 1982 when his daughter 
tatyana began a highly publicized hunger strike to join her husband 
and daughter in the united states 
tatyana married edward lozansky a physicist in 1972 lozansky 
a dissident emigrated with their daughter now 17 
yershov opposed edward lozanskys departure and asked him not 
to go at first he refused to sign papers to allow tatyana to 
follow 
then tatyana began a hunger strike and yershov realized it 
was her right to come here to join her husband and child 
yershovs view of the united states changed when he arrived to 
visit his daughter now a us citizen and his granddaughter now 
a freshman at brown university 
among his impressions said yershov the most important is the 
sharp contrast in the lives of the people of the united states and 
the ussr 
we have shortages of goods long lines in stores and poor 
services he said here everything is the opposite everything 
is done for the people that is the most important difference

rival tamil guerrilla groups battled 
with guns in eastern sri lanka on sunday and at least 36 were 
killed and 15 seriously injured officials said 
the fighting in the villages of tampiluvil and tamputte both 
about 20 miles southeast of ampara was the first clash between 
rival tamil groups since indian peacekeeping soldiers left the area 
two weeks ago 
military officials said about 50 members of the liberation 
tigers of tamil eelam the largest rebel group raided two camps 
run by rivals and killed 30 men the two camps are about a 
halfmile apart they said 
six tamil tigers also were killed in the fighting said the 
officials who cannot be identified under briefing rules 
the camps aparently are run by a group known as the tamil 
national army a militia organized by former rebels to try to 
maintain order in the violencewracked area 
the officials said the attackers abducted about 30 men of the 
tamil national army 
residents in ampara 125 miles east of colombo said an 
unofficial curfew was being enforced in the town and that all shops 
were closed 
a tamil tiger leader in colombo confirmed the attack action 
has been taken to dismantle the illegal tamil national army he 
said 
the sri lankan army commander lt gen hamilton wanasinghe 
said troops were sent to the two villages the soldiers will take 
necessary action and see that there is no repetition of such 
incidents wanasinghe said 
india withdrew about 4000 soldiers from the ampara district 
last month heightening fears of renewed bloodshed between tamil 
groups 
the latest fighting marked a new phase in the 6yearold 
struggle by the tamil tigers and other guerrilla groups for a 
separate tamil homeland in the north and east 
most groups gave up the armed struggle under an indiamediated 
accord in july 1987 the tamil tigers briefly accepted the 
agreement but then turned their guns on indian soldiers who had 
been sent to sri lanka to supervise the accord 
the indians numbers swelled from 2000 to about 100000 as the 
tamil tigers began attacking them the indian force has been 
periodically withdrawn in batches and the remaining 36000 soldiers 
are scheduled to leave by dec 31 
as the deadline advances concern has been mounting over who 
will keep peace in the area sri lankas small army is tied down in 
its own battle against sinhalese radicals in the south 
tamil tigers are currently engaged in peace talks with the 
sinhalesedominated government in colombo 
their demand for a separate nation grew out of complaints of 
discrimination by the majority sinhalese in jobs and education 
tamils make up 18 percent of sri lankas 16 million people 
sinhalese make up 75 percent of the population

the head of an 82nation 
conference on population growth said sunday that fighting 
illiteracy among women is key to slowing a birthrate that could 
more than double the worlds inhabitants in 100 years 
the un population fund sponsoring the conference that begins 
monday will seek agreement on eradicating illiteracy among women 
by the year 2000 and improving the availability of contraceptives 
conference sources said 
the gathering opens the same day the us house of 
representatives debates a 15 million proposal to resume funding to 
the un agency the money was cut off in 1985 over an 
agencysupported chinese birth control policy 
nafis sadik the un agencys pakistani executive director 
told reporters the aim of the fourday forum is to thrash out a 
list of recommendations that governments can use as targets in 
their own population control programs 
those would include figures on bringing down infant and maternal 
mortality rates and improving womens education seen as a key 
factor in determining their willingness to accept family planning 
attitude changes seem to take place where education levels 
are higher particularly among women and girls she said 
women dont want to have so many children but they do because 
thats whats expected of them demographers say the worlds 
population is 52 billion and increases by 90 million a year if 
nothing is done to slow the rate the globe could contain 14 
billion people by the year 2090 
under the un agencys goals all schoolage girls should be 
enrolled in some form of education by the year 2000 said a 
conference source speaking on condition of anonymity 
the source added that the un agency was pressing for agreement 
on making contraceptives available to at least 56 percent of the 
worlds women by the year 2000 the figure today is 45 percent 
on the us funding issue ms sadik said the first priority 
to us is to get the us back in the consensus on family 
planning rather than arguing for a bigger sum 
washington withdrew its 36 million funding of the agency in 
1985 because of allegtions that an agency program in china included 
forced sterilizations and abortions 
the senate has already earmarked 15 million for the resumption 
of the us contribution but president bush has said he would use 
his veto if the measure is approved by the house 
they the us government dont really have any viewpoint on 
the chinese population program ms sadik said the us 
decision has somehow got linked to the abortion issue in the united 
states

ben nichols doesnt mind being labeled a 
socialist 
but the man who is likely to be ithacas next mayor is quick to 
emphasize that hes a democratic socialist a member and former 
chairman of the democratic socialists of america 
the key word is democratic nichols said in a recent 
interview 
the retired engineering professor defeated threeterm incumbent 
john c gutenberger by a convincing 56to44 percent margin in the 
democratic primary in september he will face jean cookingham a 
former attorney for the federal housing administration in 
tuesdays general election in this college town of 30000 
the man who was known as the only socialist mayor in the nation 
bernard sanders of burlington vt stepped down in march after 
serving four terms sanders however ran on a thirdparty ticket 
dubbed the progressive coalition while nichols is running as a 
democrat 
in ithaca where registered democrats outnumber republicans by 
more than a 2to1 margin nichols appears to have the election 
sewn up 
nichols says being a socialist wont directly affect his actions 
as mayor but the socialist label he said does indicate what my 
priorities are 
those priorities include strong support for labor the homeless 
and minorities nichols also thinks real estate developers should 
help pay for lowcost housing and wants new laws to protect 
tenants 
my interests are much more those of the working people than 
the prerogatives of business he said he said he is not 
antibusiness but doesnt think business needs his help in getting 
its voice heard 
nichols who is midway through his first term on the citys 
common council said he also hopes to establish better relations 
with cornell university his alma mater and former employer and a 
major force in ithaca 
cornell he said should pay more to the city for the services 
it receives even if the taxexempt university just paid for fire 
services he said it could trim the citys property taxes 
not that he would reduce those taxes nichols added hed 
probably use the money for something else more government takes 
more money although he would rather not raise property taxes 
which he considers regressive 
i think we have to do a very vigorous job finding sources of 
revenue other than property tax he said 
nichols republican opponent criticizes his proposal to create 
new government commissions saying she believes in less government 
not more 
i dont think with a tight budget that should be a high 
priority cookingham said i do not regard government as a 
quick fix for a problem the solutions that i have do not show a 
great deal of government involvement 
nichols socialist tag hasnt been much of an issue in the 
mayoral campaign and the candidate says he doesnt expect any mass 
defection of democrats 
i think its because they know me he said ive been 
involved in city government im a known quantity im not going to 
do anything wild or irrational

premier nikolai i ryzhkov on sunday appealed to 
striking coal miners in the soviet arctic to end a walkout that he 
said endangers winter fuel supplies 
strikers reported that the minister of the coal industry 
mikhail i shchadov arrived in the area and that they expected a 
meeting with him monday 
the situation that has arisen at present in the coal industry 
especially on the eve of winter creates an inadmissible 
situation in ensuring vital supplies for our people ryzhkov 
said his comments were carried by the officials tass news agency 
workers in the largest mine of the pechora basin in the komi 
region went on strike oct 25 to protest what they said were 
government delays in fulfilling promises it made to end nationwide 
mining strikes in july 
the pechora workers were joined last week by miners at 10 other 
mines and only two mines in the region were operating over the 
weekend miners say more than 15000 of them are on strike and the 
official media say the strike already has cost millions of dollars 
in lost production 
the workers also have advanced political demands including the 
removal of language in the soviet constitution that makes the 
communist party the leading force of society 
echoing the slogans of the bolshevik revolution which the 
country will commemorate tuesday they demanded that power be 
turned over to local governing councils land to farmers and 
factories to workers 
a local court declared the strike illegal but did not try to 
halt it 
ryzhkov said the strike could lead to extremely grave 
results he did not elaborate 
appealing to your reason and workers honor i ask you to show 
reason and a sense of civic duty for the consequences which can 
arise in the country to stop strikes to maintain the necessary 
rhythm of work to ensure a normal life for the soviet people he 
said 
he said the council of ministers or cabinet is keeping tabs on 
fulfillment of the promises of better living and working conditions 
that the government made in july 
government officials will meet with miners nov 17 to review how 
well the government has kept its promises he said 
vladimir deneka a spokesman for the strike committee in the 
komi regional capital vorkuta said in a telephone interview that 
miners knew about ryzhkovs appeal only from moscow reporters who 
had called to ask their reaction 
shchadov arrived in vorkuta but had not yet met with miners 
deneka added the coal minister was studying the workers demands 
and was in contact with moscow about them he said

the razing of colonial buildings to make way 
for a glassandsteel skyline may irritate prince charles but 
politics could keep the architectural critic in him quiet during 
this weeks royal visit 
the royal couple are coming to the colony despite a flareup of 
antibritish sentiment over the summer when london made clear it 
will allow only a small percentage of hong kong residents to settle 
in britain after china takes over the territory in 1997 
prince charles and princess diana arrive in the british colony 
tuesday 
they will spend much of their fourday official stay cutting 
ribbons and visiting social service organizations no doubt keenly 
aware they are not to upset the colonys delicate political 
situation 
charles has accused modern architects planners and developers 
of causing more harm to londons skyline than the german air force 
did during the world war ii blitz he is to officially open a 
couple of new additions to the skyline here 
in a recently published book charles says many modern buildings 
are devoid of character and fail to meet the needs of the people 
who live and work in them 
the prince tends to like classicalstyle buildings with 
porticoes columns and decorations 
david russell a senior lecturer in university of hong kongs 
architecture department believes the prince will find much to his 
dislike in the colonys architecture 
hong kongs skyline is crowded with boxlike office towers that 
create a completely dull and depressing environment russell 
said 
russell views some of the newer additions including the yawning 
waterfront hong kong convention and exhibition center the prince is 
to officially open and the prismatic 70story bank of china as 
among the colossal monsters of glass and steel going up around 
hong kong 
the human being put next to them is totally dwarfed and 
rendered quite insignificant he said 
but kellogg wong associate partner in the new yorkbased im 
pei architectural firm that designed the bank of china building 
has described it as a thing of beauty a sculpture in itself 
charles also will open the hong kong cultural center a 
lowslung windowless building that has been described as a ski 
jump and a huge skateboard ramp 
conservationists find this highly ironic because the center lies 
on the former site of a victorianstyle railroad station they had 
tried to save from destruction in the mid1970s by appealing to the 
princes mother queen elizabeth ii 
william meacham a former member of the official antiquities 
advisory board said the station was a prominent landmark 
overlooking the colonys famous harbor before it was demolished in 
1978 only the clock tower was left standing 
many other landmarks have been razed during hong kongs rapid 
growth since world war ii leaving only a few of the graceful 
colonialera buildings still standing 
but russell and meacham says the prince is not likely to say 
anything critical 
i think he was instructed to keep the visit rather lowkey 
because the british government certainly is not in very good odor 
in hong kong he said diplomatically he will probably keep 
his mouth shut so he wont put his foot in it

thai fishermen sunday rescued four 
crewmen from an american oil company ship that capsized in a 
typhoon the day before with 97 people aboard the company said 
the bodies of two others were found inside the stillfloating 
seacrest but the fate of other 91 crewmen from 13 countries was 
unknown after two days of intensive search efforts in the gulf of 
thailand seven americans were aboard 
we have not given up hope by any means and the search effort 
will continue through the night said unocal spokeswoman carol 
scott in bangkok 
two thai fishing boats picked up three thais and one indonesian 
from the overturned oil drilling vessel said officials of unocal 
thailand a subsidiary of the los angelesbased company that owns 
the seacrest 
they were identified as nico matatula of indonesia and somchoke 
noosuwan long amphairit and chavalit duangpakdee of thailand

survivors had failed to find any signs of life within the ship or 
in the surrounding sea rescue workers searched 600 square miles of 
the gulf 
a remotecontrolled underwater vehicle located the two bodies in 
the ships living quarters divers will try to recover the bodies 
scott said 
the thai navy sent divers and the special undersea craft which 
took videotape within the vessel a section or all of the living 
quarters of the ship are submerged 
the 351foot vessel capsized early saturday after being struck 
by 100 mph wind and high seas spawned by typhoon gay described by 
thai meteorologists as the countrys worst typhoon in 35 years 
the seacrest capsized in the gulfs platong field one of 
several being exploited for natural gas by unocal it is 270 miles 
south of bangkok 
after hitting the gulf typhoon gay swept inland across the 
peninsula of southern thailand killing at least 26 people and

young east german families squeezed 
into tiny sedans poured through this border town toward west 
germany early sunday abandoning a homeland in which they had lost 
trust 
east german trabant cars arrived at the rate of 30 to 40 an hour 
at the border crossing to northern bavaria almost all of them 
packed with people in their 20s or early 30s many with young 
children 
we heard the news at nine last night and by 11 we were 
gone said a 26yearold woman from schwerin in the north of 
east germany 
she her husband their two sons and a friend drove all night to 
cheb here they met several other families and young people who 
like them had leapt into their cars once they heard they could 
travel freely to west germany for the first time in their lives 
my friend woke me up at two in the morning said a 
21yearold from annaberg close to the czechosolovak border he 
were are he said with a grin 
all the people interviewed expressed no confidence in their 
communist leadership at home even if it does introduce reforms 
my wife and i are leaving because we lost any hope that the 
gdr east germany will meet our expectations in life said an 
earnest 32yearold worker from leipzig 
he recounted how his last hopes vanished the night of oct 34 
when he saw police beat children as security forces battled 
thousands of people trying to get into the dresden railway station 
they were trying to board a special train going west from prague 
through east germany 
i didnt intend to flee myself i simply brought friends there 
who wanted to leave said the man who like others interviewed 
refused to give his full name it was horrible 
before that i thought there was some future in the gdr i 
earned well but they always told us the gdr was a peaceful state 
and when you see your hopes disappointed like that you have to 
leave 
a few of the waiting young east germans said they wanted to try 
just to visit west germany for a day 
we decided in the bar last night said one of three 
welldressed youths crammed into a stylish soviet car fitted with 
western accouterments that spell money in the east bloc 
we just want to have a cup of coffe and come back again 
said one of his friends 
we dont do badly in the gdr he said while expressing deep 
skepticism about the chances of new east german leader egon krenz 
introducing genuine change 
nobody believes him really nobody said the third of the 
youths who came from the town of plauen the site of several mass 
demonstrations for democracy in recent weeks 
but the youths were disappointed in their quest an east german 
car at the front of the 50car line turned around at the border 
announcing that it was impossible just to visit west germany 
we lost our bet one of the youths shrugged as they headed 
back home 
but most of those waiting were going to west germany to stay 
one 32yearold father from weimar took two of his children and 
drove through the night leaving his wife and two more children 
behind to join the family later in west germany 
the thought of leaving was always there he said nows 
the chance we have no trust in the whole thing in east germany 
as long as those people are in power nobody has any confidence

pulse rates quicken during any aircraft 
carrier landing but the heartpounding is most intense during a 
flight students first time say fellow trainees of a pilot who 
crashed into the uss lexington 
the accident killed the student pilot ensign steven e pontell 
23 of columbia md and four people on the flight deck 
pontell stationed at meridian miss naval air station was 
making his first approach to a carrier when he crashed 
a few hours before the accident on oct 29 ensign william 
ray dyer of cookville tenn was in the same position but 
landed without incident six times 
dyer a student pilot at pensacola naval air station said he 
was calm and preoccupied with flying the t2 buckeye training jet 
the same type pontell flew until he turned into final approach 
called the groove 
i rolled into the groove and it hit me dyer said i felt 
my heart beat thats the first time in a plane ive ever felt 
that i was going oh my god its like everything the past year 
went whoosh right in front of me 
studies show landing on a carrier in which the plane is 
stopped abruptly via a hook hanging from its tail that is snared by 
a cable strung across the deck puts greater stress on a pilot 
than flying into combat said lt scott means of key west an 
instructor pilot at pensacola 
means said a fellow pilot had the best description its a 
cross between a pleasurable sex experience and a car crash 
dyer said he couldnt let the crash bother him 
accidents will happen dyer said its not an 
accidentfree environment we live in 
that realization was magnified last week the lexington crash 
was only the first of five accidents all unrelated involving navy 
ships and planes around the world that took seven lives in a span 
of four days 
of all the navys activities landing jets on ships may be the 
most hazardous but student pilots say crashing is not their 
greatest fear 
i would say the fear of failure is about 80 percent of it 
said ensign bill hiscock of fort lauderdale another 
pensacolabased student pilot who made his first carrier landing 
oct 29 
if they dont do this properly theres a chance they may not 
get their wings means explained thats where the apprehension 
comes from 
the consequences may be dismissal from the navy or getting a 
nonflying assignment historically a jet student has rarely been 
allowed to shift to helicopters or propellerdriven planes 
although the navy may have spent up to 1 million to train him 
the attitude thats taken is that the other communities 
dont want somebody elses trash so to speak means said he 
added however that the navy is loosening up a bit on this tradition 
by the time a pilot attempts a carrier landing he has about 250 
hours of flying time all must eventually make 10 landings or 
traps aboard a carrier to complete their training 
before that though they make 80 touchandgo landings on 
runways painted with the outline of a flight deck they make two 
touchandgo landings on the carrier before their first trap all 
without instructors because flying solo builds confidence means 
said 
seeing the carrier for the first time can be intimidating as it 
looks so tiny from the air 
i wanted so much to look down at the ship to see what it 
looked like and i just said i cant do it dyer recalled 
the hook hanging from the planes tail is supposed to catch one 
of four cables strung across the deck bringing the jet to a dead 
stop from about 120 mph in two seconds 
even though their ultimate aim is to stop pilots push their 
throttles to full power as soon as the wheels touch so they can 
fly off the other end of the angled deck if they miss the cables 
the first trap was a surprise i didnt think id stop dyer 
said i hit the deck and the next thing you know im stopping 
and a guys running out to me shouting power back power back 
i had froze on the controls and then finally i said ok im 
safe im down im stopped

radicals effort to turn the 10th 
anniversary of the us embassy seizure into a show of strength 
backfired badly indicating widening support for president hashemi 
rafsanjani 
the 10000 to 15000 who turned up for a rally outside the 
former embassy saturday is an insignificant number in iran where 
attendance at such protests is usually counted in the hundreds of 
thousands 
the failure of the rally to develop into a massive antius 
demonstration was all the more telling since it had been preceded 
by a week of radical exhortations for people to mark the 
anniversary more splendidly than ever 
iranians had been urged to turn the event into a day of hatred 
for world arrogance led by the united states to hail the nov4 
1979 storming of the embassy by militants 
they held 52 diplomats and other embassy personnel hostage for 
444 days in what iranians viewed as a revolutionary triumph that 
humiliated the united states 
the rally was addressed by radical leader ali akbar mohtashemi 
the former interior minister whom rafsanjani dropped from his 
cabinet 
the climax came at the end of a 50minute antiamerican diatribe 
by mohtashemi with the burning of 160 american flags 
diplomats and other observers cautioned that the relatively poor 
turnout should not be interpreted as a lessening of still 
widespread antiamerican sentiment in iran or of inflexible islamic 
doctrines 
these were imposed by the late revolutionary leader ayatollah 
ruhollah khomeini his death june 3 and the july 28 election of 
rafsanjani raised hopes that irans leadership would move the 
country away to some extent from clerical domination 
nonetheless the slogancovered banners carried by hundreds of 
students who marched from tehran university across the city to the 
former us embassy compound underlined that khomeinis spirit 
lives on 
the most striking slogan proclaimed compromise with the 
united states is religiously forbidden as the imam khomeini 
said and the imams line is to fight the united states 
this rejectionist approach contrasted with rafsanjanis 
perceived policy of seeking rapprochement with the west to end 
irans isolation and help fund reconstruction badly needed after 
the eightyear iraniraq war 
at a news conference last week rafsanjani indicated readiness 
for better relations with washington anathema to the radicals 
his approach appears to have the backing of many people 
increasingly resentful of the continuing hardships they have to 
endure resulting as much from the war as from the strict islamic 
rules imposed by khomeini 
many people believe that last years ceasefire in the war 
indicated a general improvement in irans relations with the rest 
of the world particularly the rich western countries that could 
help the postwar rebuilding 
this improvement has accelerated since rafsanjanis election as 
underlined by the flow of business and diplomatic contacts with 
western european governments eager for a share of lucrative 
reconstruction projects 
the gradual relaxation of irans international isolation 
coincides with an easing inside the country of the islamic dress 
code for women which requires them to appear in public in the 
traditional chador or headtotoe veil 
some women appear in public wearing makeup scarves that barely 
cover their heads and capes that end well above the calf it has 
already drawn the ire of radical clergymen 
recent editorials in the more radical tehran newspapers have 
criticized this lack of hejab or islamic dress code for women 
the editorials demand stricter enforcement which the rafsanjani 
government is apparently unwilling to impose 
the simmering conflict is an inseparable part of the 
confrontation between the radicals and the socalled pragmatists 
as rafsanjani is known 
in what appeared to be another divergence of opionion between 
radicals and pragmatists officials at the staterun tehran 
television station which is run by rafsanjanis brother mohammed 
censored scenes of of us flags being burned at the rally saturday 
the footage of the demonstration was being relayed by satellite 
to western stations via the tehran studios which frequently 
control what goes out

namibians of all parties and races vote 
together for the first time this week in elections that will lead 
to independence for their warscarred territory 
the united nations has mounted its most extensive and costly 
operation to monitor the week of voting and ballotcounting in 
africas last colony most of it sparsely populated desert 
the election for a constitutionwriting assembly will be 
administered by south africa which agreed last year to end its 
74year rule over namibia officials from 25 countries will observe 
the voting along with monitors from the 7650member un force 
that has been deployed in the territory since april at the cost of 
some 450 million 
voting is to take place tuesday through saturday with results 
expected early next week the 701483 registered voters will be 
choosing among 10 parties and casting ballots at 350 polling 
stations 
with an illiteracy rate of 60 percent confusing ballot symbols 
for the parties intricate voter identification procedures and the 
presence of up to 25 observers at each polling station there is a 
strong possibility of disputes or delays before the outcome is 
known 
the focus of the election is whether the southwest africa 
peoples organization or swapo which fought a 23year guerrilla 
war against south african rule will win twothirds of the 72 
assembly seats enough to write the constitution without 
compromising with other parties 
swapos leaders are known as marxists and once threatened to set 
up reeducation camps for policemen and politicians who served 
the territorial government but since returning from three decades 
of exile swapo leaders have preached reconciliation among the more 
than 13 million people including 75000 whites spread over 
318252 square miles 
martti ahtisaari of finland the topranking un official in 
namibia is charged with declaring whether the elections meet the 
un requirement of being free and fair 
many namibians mistrust the united nations because the world 
body for years designated swapo as the sole representative of the 
namibian people it lifted that designation early this year 
un resolution 435 which outlines the independence process 
calls for the constitution to include a bill of rights independent 
judiciary periodic elections multiple parties and free speech 
swapo has accepted those principles as guidelines but its 
election manifesto is contradictory and unspecific on those and 
other issues such as a free press and land redistribution 
the united nations has never specified the exact procedure for 
declaring independence and forming a new government 
if all goes well a new government will take power early next 
year ending south africas rule over the former german colony 
which also is known as southwest africa 
but all has not gone well so far 
on april 1 the first day of the unsupervised transition 
period hundreds of swapo guerrillas crossed the border from 
angola violating agreements and triggering battles that reportedly 
killed 340 men 
the united nations brought home more than 41000 refugees 
mostly swapo supporters from a dozen countries to take part in the 
election 
some of the returnees said they had been tortured in swapo camps 
and falsely accused of being south african spies a un 
investigation revealed that 315 people alleged to have been 
detained by swapo were missing and 100 were dead 
the fourmonth election campaign has been marked by 
intimidation fighting at political rallies the assassination of 
swapos only white executive member and attacks on un forces and 
journalists 
five days before the election south african foreign minister 
pik botha threatened to delay the voting and call south african 
forces from their bases to deal with another alleged incursion by 
swapo from angola swapo and the united nations said bothas 
charges were baseless

it took about 7 seconds for an eightstory 
75yearold building to collapse sunday to make way for a 
multimilliondollar mall 
some 361 charges were placed on six levels of the occidental 
building to bring the structure down the building collapsed from 
south to north as a brief chain of explosive charges went off and 
witnesses applauded and cheered 
the occidental building was imploded to accommodate the 970 
million circle centre mall project the office and retail building 
was once the home of l strauss amp co the citys oldest retail 
clothier from 1945 to 1985 
the implosion was conducted by controlled demolition inc which 
has taken down some 6000 buildings around the world since it was 
founded in the 1940s 
keeping the curious at a safe distance was one of the biggest 
concerns said company president j mark loizeaux 
people started to sneak around he said there was a bona 
fide hideandseek game the efforts by crowds to get closer was 
an aggravation for the police department and caused a slight delay 
loizeaux said 
in two nearby hotels the hyatt regency and the embassy suites 
rooms facing the occidental were sold out in anticipation of the 
big bang the hyatt regency itself stands on a site cleared by 
controlled demolition in 1973 
once the crowd was pushed back its assigned distance the 
implosion occurred the project carried 30 million worth of 
insurance loizeaux said 
the occidental built in 1914 was one of a series of 
skyscrapers built in postvictorian downtown indianapolis

visiting the site of attempts to ban his book 
being there novelist jerzy kosinski said censorship threatens 
students ability to question the world 
last spring a group of crete parents objected to descriptions 
of sexual acts in being there and tried to keep the novel out 
of an 11thgrade english class the school board didnt ban the 
book but adopted a policy calling for closer scrutiny of reading 
lists 
the first amendment is not the issue here kosinski said 
saturday at doane college instead the key need is communication 
between parents and teachers none of us wants the student to 
suffer from literary malnutrition so that he ends up with a tv 
dinner 
the author of nine novels kosinski said he doesnt want to 
restrict parents rights to express curriculum concerns but wants 
them more involved in teaching their children 
i feel that the classroom is not just a place where literature 
can be pondered it is a place where life is pondered where a 
reader can question issues kosinski said 
kosinskis visit was sponsored by the nebraska civil liberties 
union and the academic freedom coalition of nebraska

thousands of young east german 
refugees rolled into west germany at the rate of more than 100 an 
hour sunday causing a traffic jam that stretched several miles 
back into czechoslovakia 
the people will keep fleeing as long as they can said 
christian schreiber a 23yearold east german who joined 
countrymen taking advantage of the new freedom to escape their 
communist homeland through czechoslovakia 
driving their sputtering trabants and wartburgs filled with 
stereos luggage and children the refugees needed to travel only 
15 miles from the east german border to reach bavaria in west 
germany 
at least 15000 east germans had arrived in west germany via 
czechoslovakia by sunday west german border officials said they 
came by special trains from prague or drove their own cars to the 
border after learning of the new escape route schirnding was the 
closest border crossing for those using the new route 
the refugees ignored pleas by new communist party leader egon 
krenz to remain in east germany and scoffed at his promises of 
reforms so far this year about 170000 people have left seeking 
freedom in the west 
people just dont trust the government said schreiber a 
dental technician from staaken outside east berlin he and his wife 
and son had been waiting seven hours in the cold and had a long 
wait still to go 
how long will they keep coming that you have to ask mr 
krenz said uwe luethje the federal border police duty chief 
sunday afternoon 
you can see how patient these people have been luethje 
added they learn that from waiting in lines for so long outside 
shops 
on friday communist officials in east berlin agreed to allow 
neighboring czechoslovakia to open its western frontier for east 
germans seeking to go west east germany on wednesday lifted its 
monthold ban on travel to czechoslovakia the only country east 
germans can visit freely 
those who have stayed behind have demanded that the east german 
government make democratic reforms and allow freer travel as many 
as 1 million people demonstrated on saturday in east berlin urging 
reform 
in east berlin a sign prominently displayed outside the city 
hall during a debate between local officials and citizens on sunday 
said the communist party is driving the citizens out of the 
country 
like most of the tens of thousands of east germans who have fled 
west since august the majority of the latest round of newcomers 
were young people many of them with small children 
the older people just cant pick up and start a new life 
somewhere else schreiber said 
pretty soon there wont be anyone except old people in east 
germany one west german woman said as she scanned the sea of young 
faces 
many refugees milled around their cars others dozed while 
parents bravely tried to keep their children amused as temperatures 
dipped to 40 degrees like the schreiber family many had to wait 
seven hours or more at the checkpoint 
red cross workers in a tent poured hundreds of cups of steaming 
hot coffee and tea while mechanics from west germanys adac 
automobile club stood by with offers of assistance for those whose 
cars had trouble 
we have no west german marks and no gas in the car said 
marion stahl of magdeburg as she waited at the schirnding crossing 
but the 26yearold woman added grimly id never go back 
never 
earlier in the day the line of cars waiting to cross into 
bavaria had stretched back nearly six miles from the border 
in addition to the schirnding checkpoint east germans also were 
pouring into bavaria at the waidhaus crossing which is the second 
closest to east germany 
about 70000 other east germans have fled west through hungary 
poland and czechoslovakia since august when the reformminded 
hungarian government began dismantling its border barriers with the 
west 
together with a record level of legal emigration from east 
germany authorities predict more than 190000 east germans will 
arrive this year in west germany which grants automatic 
citizenship to east germans 
karl heinz horndasch a spokesman for the federal border police 
in munich said the number of temporary shelters jumped from four 
on friday to 25 nationwide as of sunday afternoon 
we are considering now whether we will have to open more 
horndasch told the associated press in a telephone interview

the el rukns dominated the streets like no other 
gang in city history controlling a thriving drug trade with 
ruthless efficiency for nearly 25 years but officials are hoping 
their reign is finally ending 
lawenforcement authorities say their latest offensive two 
sweeping federal indictments affected most of the gangs top 
ranks scores of arrests followed the oct 27 indictments charging 
65 gang members and associates with counts that include 
racketeering conspiracy and murder 
the indictments charge that gang members committed 20 murders 
attempted others and intimidated witnesses to control drug 
trafficking on the citys south and west sides with links to five 
states traffic worth hundreds of thousands of dollars a week in 
street sales 
gang members who killed on their leaders orders will testify 
for the prosecution when the case goes to trial probably next 
summer authorities say 
we have definitely put a nail in the coffin said chicago 
police capt ron jablon who led the raid on the fort the el 
rukns fortified headquarters 
several defendants have already pleaded guilty and the gangs 
roster of 250300 hardcore members already was depleted by 
convictions and criminal charges 
but the death knell has sounded before and the el rukn gang has 
been able to endure for more than two decades creating a street 
legend of violence drug traffic worth millions each year and even 
international intrigue including an attempt to help out libya 
these guys are unique said a federal official who spoke on 
condition of anonymity they grew up from little gangbangers to 
a major organized criminal enterprise that lived by shootings and 
murders 
also if the indictments cut into the upper echelons others 
could step in 
youre never going to eliminate street gangs completely and 
the sort of mystique of the el rukn organization is going to be 
hard to kick in a community where its flourished for 25 years 
said the official 
attorney james graham representing defendant michael sardin 
complained that the government is picking on a bunch of middleaged 
men who might once have been involved in the gang but are now 
associates at most 
theyre trying to clean the streets up of anybody that could 
go back and revitalize the el rukns graham said 
one of the gang associates indicted is noah robinson half 
brother of twotime democratic presidential hopeful jesse jackson 
robinson was charged with offering the el rukns money to kill two 
men one of whom was slain and with supplying narcotics to the 
gangs drug operation 
the gang began in the mid1960s on the mostly black south side 
first called the blackstone rangers it evolved into the p stone 
nation an amalgamation of several gangs whose leaders ruled 
together 
during that period of black pride activism and power two 
members attended thenpresident nixons 1969 inaugural and the 
gang received federal funds for jobtraining programs 
but the use of those funds was called into question and leader 
jeff fort received a fiveyear sentence for fraud 
fort became a moslem in prison and formed the el rukn gang upon 
his release in 1976 naming it for the cornerstone of a shrine at 
mecca 
authorities say islam did not slow gang activity though el rukn 
inmates once filed a federal lawsuit seeking permission to hold 
religious services in prison a federal judge ruled in 1986 that it 
would be too dangerous to allow them to assemble 
in 1987 fort and four other el rukns were convicted of 
conspiracy and weapons charges accused of offering to commit 
terrorist acts for libya against the united states 
fort who oversaw the effort from a texas prison in coded 
telephone conversations was sentenced to 80 years in prison 
at the time a cook county prosecutor declared the gang was 
crumbling and that all their leaders were in jail 
in november 1988 fort was sentenced to 75 years for involvement 
in the 1981 slaying of a rival drug dealer 
and still the el rukn gang rumbled on 
authorities say the gang uses hit squads to systematically 
eliminate drugtrade competitors and that the latest spate of 
arrests may help resolve as many as 50 murder cases dating to the 
late 1960s 
some officials put the toll at more than 100 
the el rukn headquarters is sealed and targeted for razing the 
site may become a playground

ended with a tentative ceasefire last year 
the source said the purported spies put valuable intelligence 
information at the disposal of the central intelligence agency

president bush warmly welcomed the election 
sunday of rene mouawad as president of lebanon and urged all 
lebanese to back his efforts to end the 14year civil war 
the state department also issued a congratulatory statement that 
singled out for criticism christian army commander gen michel 
aoun who had tried to block the session of the lebanese parliament 
that elected mouawad 
we call upon gen aoun and the armed forces to respect the 
results of parliaments action said state department spokeswoman 
nancy beck reading a written statement 
at the white house presidential spokesman marlin fitzwater said 
bush welcomes the election of rene mouawad the president also 
commends lebanons parliament for its ratification of the national 
reconciliation charter 
the state department said that we extend to president mouawad 
our sincere congratulations and best wishes we ask all parties 
to refrain from violence and intimidation and aid president mouawad 
in reunifying lebanon 
to elect mouawad parliament met beyond the range of aouns 
artillery at kleiat in syrianpoliced north lebanon the 
parliament also ratified a peace plan brokered by the arab league 
last month in taif saudi arabia 
the state department statement said general aoun with his 
confrontational tactics and threats of partition does a disservice 
to the state and people he claims to defend 
we believe that the overwhelming majority of lebanese wish for 
an end to 14 years of war and a restoration of lebanons unity 
independence and sovereignty 
the election of president mouawad and the ratification of the 
taif agreement are the first steps toward achieving those goals as 
well as the withdrawal of all foreign forces 
aoun had threatened to shell parliament when it initially 
planned to meet in beirut on saturday to ratify the taif accord 
the peace plan shifts political power to the moslem majority 
from the christians who were believed to be in the majority when 
the existing political system was devised in the 1940s aoun 
opposes the accord because it has no fixed schedule for a total 
withdrawal of the estimated 40000 syrian troops backing moslem 
forces 
mouawad is a maronite catholic parliament also reelected house 
speaker hussein husseini a shiite moslem who has held the post 
since 1984

an oregon squabble over whether the 
constitutional right to religious freedom can stretch far enough to 
allow illegal drug use will be back before the nations highest 
court monday 
the case thats making an unusual second trip to the us 
supreme court involves religious traditions substantially older 
than the us constitution itself 
the battle began after two members of the native american church 
were fired as counselors at a roseburg drug and alcohol treatment 
center because they had used peyote a hallucinogenic drug in 
religious ceremonies 
attorney general dave frohnmayer sees unsettling implications in 
the idea of giving constitutional protection to drug use lawyers 
on the other side say the existence of an ancient religion could be 
at stake in the case 
peyote also known as mescal comes from a small cactus that 
grows in mexico and the southwestern united states indians have 
used it ceremonially for centuries and attribute spiritual 
qualities to the substance 
the drug is generally illegal but the court case is a civil and 
not a criminal action because alfred smith and galen black were 
denied unemployment compensation on grounds they were dismissed for 
misconduct 
the oregon supreme court in 1986 ruled that refusing to pay the 
jobless benefits violated the mens first amendment rights to free 
exercise of religion 
the state appealed and the us supreme court last year 
returned the case to oregons top court with directions to address 
the criminal status of the drug under state law 
the state court again held that religious use of peyote is 
protected by the constitution although the drug is illegal by state 
law 
frohnmayer who planned to personally argue the states case 
before the nations highest tribunal says the oregon supreme court 
and us supreme court both overreached in injecting the criminal 
drug law vs religious freedom issue into the case 
as a result he said in a recent interview he has little idea 
about what to expect from the justices in washington 
what they have in mind is somewhat baffling to all of us he 
said 
frohnmayer said hes worried about the court setting a 
cumbersome precedent if an exception is made for peyote he asks 
what about religions that claim they need to use marijuna or other 
drugs 
the concern the state has is the specter of engaging in a 
religionbyreligion drugbydrug examination frohnmayer said 
putting the long arm of government into testing peoples 
sincerity is troubling 
and frohnmayer said the oregon constitution commands absolute 
neutrality on religions 
smith a klamath indian who lives in eugene says the use of 
peyote is a sacrament and that the substance is viewed as medicine 
the yearslong court case is unfair he said recently 
its racism and bigotry im just tired of it all said 
smith wholl turn 70 the day the case is argued 
more than 20 states and the federal government exempt religious 
use of peyote from criminal sanctions oregon has no such 
exemption and frohnmayer doubts if one for a particular religion 
could survive the state constitutions language 
craig dorsay a portland lawyer representing smith and black 
takes issue with frohnmayers reading of the constitution 
the language permits differences and certainly allows for an 
exception for the religious use of peyote dorsay said 
he said an adverse decision could severely damage and maybe 
destroy the native american church 
it cannot exist without the ceremonial traditional use of 
peyote he said its a central part of their main ceremony

israel on sunday agreed to a us plan for 
initial peace talks with palestinians but sought american 
assurances the plo will have no role in the negotiations 
vice premier shimon peres leader of the centerleft labor 
party said decisionmaking inner cabinet voted 93 to accept 
secretary of state james a baker iiis proposal but asked for 
side assurances 
foreign minister moshe arens of the rightwing likud bloc said 
the government was hopeful it would get what it wanted from baker 
the next step will be to get the guarantees from the united 
states and then to start talking about the composition of the 
palestinian delegation said avi pazner a top aide to prime 
minister yitzhak shamir he said of the assurances sought sum it 
up in one item no negotiations with the plo 
both peres and pazner said israel wanted the guarantee in 
writing 
the talks could be a long time in coming bakers plan calls for 
a palestnian delegation acceptable to israel and choosing the 
actual delegates will likely take time 
israel television reported the governments acceptance of the 
us plan was based on various assumptions 
one was that israel would only accept palestinian delegates from 
the west bank and gaza strip 
another was that washington would support israels position if 
israel were forced to leave the talks because ground rules agreed 
on with baker had been violated 
the decision comes two weeks before shamirs scheduled visit to 
the united states he could have expected a chilly reception in 
washington had israel rejected the american plan 
six months ago shamir proposed elections in the occupied west 
bank and gaza strip to choose palestinians to negotiate an 
agreement on selfrule for the 17 million palestinians in the 
territories 
bakers plan calls for a preliminary meeting in cairo with a 
palestinian delegation to discuss implementing the election plan 
sundays decision ends the wrangling over the baker plan between 
labor and the rightwing likud bloc partners in israels coalition 
government 
but it is certain to increase dissent in shamirs likud bloc 
whose hardline members oppose the baker proposal as a backdoor 
entry to peace talks for the palestine liberation organization 
israel refuses to deal with the plo which it considers a terrorist 
organization 
housing minister david levy a leader of the partys 
hardliners said the vote would put israel in a very difficult 
situation 
the plo in egypt is coordinating positions and everyone 
here is acting like blind men who dont know what is happening 
he told israel radio 
science minister ezer weizman a labor leftwinger agreed the 
vote would open the way to plo participation but complained that 
israel should openly say so 
anyhow we have indirect negotiations with the plo he told 
reporters after the nearly threehour meeting it is a bit 
hypocritical to say we are not negotiating with the plo i think we 
are still going in the right direction in the wrong way 
in cairo meanwhile the plos executive committee wound up two 
days of meetings sunday to decide if it will accept bakers plan 
committee member abdallah elharani was quoted as saying the 
15member group crystallized a united position but he would 
not say what the position was 
in the gaza strip palestinian leader assad saftawi a longtime 
associate of plo chairman yasser arafat said he and several other 
residents of the occupied territories were invited to cairo next 
week for meetings with egyptian officials 
under bakers plan egyptian president hosni mubarak will help 
form the palestinian delegation to the cairo meeting last week 
mubarak drew criticism from israeli officials when he said that in 
effect he was only acting as a middleman for the plo 
once agreement is reached on holding talks in cairo the next 
step in the us plan is for baker to meet with the egyptian and 
israeli foreign ministers on the makeup of the palestinian 
delegation

vice president dan quayle pronounced himself 
very pleased sunday with president bushs stated intention of 
keeping him on the republican ticket in 1992 but said it is too 
early to speak of his own presidential ambitions 
there are things that can happen between now and 92 and 1993 
and 1996 are a long long time away said quayle 
bush stated his commitment in response to a question during an 
interview with the dallas morning news which published the account 
this weekend 
quayle appearing sunday on the nbctv program meet the 
press said bush had not informed him facetoface of the 
decision but that i am very pleased that the president is 
pleased with the job that i am doing 
asked whether he had thought about running for president quayle 
said what has crossed my mind is just doing a good job right 
now 
the chairmen of the republican and democratic parties also 
pronounced themselves pleased sunday with bushs stated intention 
for predictably different reasons 
im very glad to hear that said democratic national 
chairman ron brown it certainly pleases me the problem with 
this administration its been an administration of symbols over 
substance dan quayle is a good symbol for the democrats to take a 
hard look at i think what we need is some strong leadership and 
not a continuation of this weather vane presidency 
appearing with brown on abcs this week with david brinkley 
gop chairman lee atwater said he was delighted with the idea of 
quayle being with bush on a 1992 ticket 
i think hes done a good job said atwater hes been 
loyal to the president hes a good man and i think the more the 
american people see him over the next few years the more theyre 
going to like him 
on his tv appearance quayle proclaimed undying loyalty to the 
president and echoed bushs lingering distrust of the soviet union 
commitment to deploy star wars antimissile defenses and opposition 
to abortion 
the vice president also blamed moscow in part for prolonging 
the strife in central america by shipping arms to nicaragua 
the fact of the matter is is that the soviet union continues 
direct shipments to nicaragua of military equipment he said 
the issue was raised by secretary of state james a baker in his 
meeting in september with the soviet foreign minister and would be 
raised again by bush in his dec 23 summit with president 
gorbachev said quayle 
at the summit gorbachev will not find a sympathetic ear if he 
tells bush the kremlin is cracking down because of instability in 
the soviet union said quayle 
if the soviet union or any other country begins to abuse 
human rights moves in a regressive direction they would not have 
sympathy from this administration said quayle 
despite gorbachevs reforms quayle said the military 
capability of the soviet union has not decreased it has increased 
furthermore let us also realize that the military spending 
contrary to all these statements that are going on in the soviet 
union has increased the united states has decreased its military 
spending not the soviet union 
and he said that the soviet should understand that 
president bush is committed to the development and deployment of a 
strategic defense system popularly known as star wars 
quayle endorsed bushs decision to veto two bills passed by 
congress that in one instance would have allowed the use of 
federal money to finance abortions for poor women who were the 
victims of rape or incest and in the other allowed the district 
of columbia to use its own money to finance abortions for poor 
women 
despite some of the public opinion polls that have been 
published i think that the majority of the people when it comes 
to public taxpayer financing of abortion want to have a very 
strict limitation on how the taxpayers money is going to be 
used for abortion quayle said

seven members of a palestinian terrorist group 
will likely be named in a scottish police report as being 
responsible for the bombing of pan am flight 103 the sunday times 
of london said 
the newspaper said the report will go to lord fraser the lord 
advocate scotlands senior law officer who is supervising the 
police investigation into the dec 21 bombing over lockerbie 
scotland 
fraser issued a statement on sunday calling on news media to 
exercise restraint in their reports lest they seriously 
jeopardize the international criminal investigation and any 
future court proceedings 
authorities have not said when the report on the investigation 
will be released 
our essential purpose is put at risk if premature disclosure 
shuts off lines of inquiry or puts potenial witnesses under 
threat he said adding i have also noted considerable 
illinformed and inaccurate speculation in relation to the federal 
german police and other international agencies 
some details in the sunday times story have been reported 
previously but the newspaper quoting unnamed western intelligence 
and security sources now claims to trace the bomb from its 
manufacture to its placement aboard the flight 
it said western intelligence agencies are convinced iran paid 
ahmed jibril leader of the popular front for the liberation of 
palestinegeneral command to bomb flight 103 as revenge for the 
shooting down of an iranian airliner by an american warship last 
year 
the newspaper said jibril ordered his top aide hafez kassem 
dalkamoni to set up the bombing team and that dalkamoni recruited 
marwan khreesat a 44yearold jordanian to make the bomb 
the radical syrianbacked popular front for the liberation of 
palestinegeneral command often has been identified as the prime 
suspect in the flight 103 bombing in a us television interview 
in april jibril denied his organization had a role in the attack 
that killed all 259 people on board and 11 on the ground 
the sunday times alleged khreesat assembled the bomb in 
frankfurt and that it was then concealed in a radiocassette player 
and smuggled to the mediterranean island of malta by a palestinian 
named ramzi diab also known as salah fiaz kwieks 
khreesat and diab were both arrested by west german police in 
raids in october 1988 but released 
fraser said sunday that the head of the british investigative 
team chief constable george esson could not substantiate reports 
about unaccompanied luggage traveling from malta to frankfurt 
let alone unaccompanied baggage with a bomb in it 
the sunday times said west german police suspected khreesat of 
being a terrorist bombmaker but freed him for lack of evidence 
even though he was being sought for two bombings of civilian 
aircraft in the early 1970s and police had found in his car a 
barometric or altitudesensitive bomb of the type used on flight 
103 
in malta diab gave the bomb to a palestinian cell operating in 
the resort town of sliema the newspaper said it said dalkamoni 
and abu talb another palestinian traveled to malta and instructed 
the cell to put the bomb on board an air malta flight to frankfurt 
where flight 103 originated 
the passengers and baggage transferred to a larger boeing 747 
during a stopover at londons heathrow airport to continue the new 
yorkbound flight 
talb is currently in custody in uppsala sweden awaiting 
separate bomb charges dalkamoni is in custody in west germany 
pending charges of attacking american military targets 
the sunday times also said investigators have questioned a 
british couple geoffrey and christine middleton who were 
vacationing in malta three weeks before the bombing 
it said they saw a blonde woman and an arab man ask western 
tourists in a cafe in sliema to carry a suitcase full of fluffy 
toys on a flight from valletta maltas capital these were 
presumably the sixth and seventh people to be named in the report 
but the newspaper did not name them 
the sunday correspondent citing unidentified police sources 
said the bomb that destroyed flight 103 began its journey in a 
suitcase loaded onto a cyprus air jet at larnaca airport 
the newspaper said at least four us intelligence agents who 
died on board flight 103 also began their journey in larnaca three 
agents were reported to have been returning from an undercover 
mission believed to be connected with the us hostages in lebanon 
it said 
one of their suitcases arrived at john f kennedy airport in new 
york three days after the bombing leading investigators to suspect 
it may have been substituted at larnaca airport for the suitcase 
containing the bomb the newspaper said

when masafumi higashi saw the images 
of toppled buildings and collapsed freeways on japanese television 
last month he was compelled to help the victims of the bay area 
earthquake 
my first reaction was to come here said the 25yearold 
english major from chuo university in tokyo i felt it was my 
duty 
higashi came along with 32 other fellow students each paying 
about 750 of their own money for air fare 
japan airlines offered the students that lowprice roundtrip 
fare when it learned of their mission to help victims of the oct 
17 earthquake higashi said toshiba donated two computers to the 
cause 
also in the student group was isao suzuki 64 who built fighter 
airplanes for the japanese air force during world war ii he said 
he wanted to repay a debt to the american people 
the younger generation today in japan has forgotten the debt 
that we owe to america suzuki said friday through an 
interpreter a big part of the reason weve been able to develop 
into the country we are today is that america helped us 
seven students arrived in california on oct 26 and the rest 
arrived wednesday after obtaining necessary passports and funds 
after talking to disaster officials in san francisco the first 
wave of students learned the big city was saturated with 
volunteers their help was most needed in hardhit santa cruz 
county to the south particularly in the small farming town of 
watsonville 
they eventually wound up at watsonvilles salvation army 
headquarters where workers last week were still distributing food 
and other essentials daily to about 300 earthquakedevastated 
families 
as soon as they arrived here from the airport they wanted to 
start work right away salvation army capt kirk suarez said of 
the students who at times have accounted for as much as half the 
volunteer staff laboring at agency headquarters near downtown 
im really fortunate to have them here suarez said 
theyve done a lot of work im amazed at their energy 
aid from japan is coming in the form of money as well as people 
japanese companies so far have pledged nearly 93 million in 
donations to the earthquake relief effort according to officials 
of the consulate general of japan 
matsushita electric industrial co and sony corp each has 
pledged 1 million with other companies offering equipment or 
relief donations from 75000 to 500000 said officials at the 
japan information center in san francisco 
the students said they have worked about eight hours a day 
seven days a week since their arrival 
they have spent their nights at a salvation army shelter in 
nearby scotts valley 
every morning suzuki wakes them up and leads them in an old 
japanese army cheer which translates as lets do our best 
their work of sorting donated clothing and packing boxes of food 
has not left the students time to see california but they said 
they have observed and learned during their short time in 
watsonville 
we came here to work not for sightseeing said nao koike a 
20yearold political science major i will go sightseeing the 
next time i come back 
working in watsonville which has a large hispanic population 
has shattered a lot of stereotypes for ms koike 
she said she once thought america was like a movie with all 
white anglosaxon protestants 
but now i know america has many kinds of people blacks 
asians hispanics she said 
for haru sato a 21yearold law student the experience has 
been important valuable interesting 
one of my biggest suprises has been to see how many people are 
working here sato said such voluntarism is unusual in japan 
where tightknit families take care of their own during crises he 
said 
also surprising has been the optimism of the american people in 
the face of disaster said sato 
the japanese people tend to withdraw in such circumstances 
the american people are just glad to be alive he said

the white house national security adviser 
predicted sunday that west germany will be able to cope with the 
thousands of east germans refugees crossing its border but called 
the situation explosive 
west germany can handle it scowcroft said on the cbstv 
program face the nation nevertheless he said were making 
plans for whatever might happen 
it would be easy for something to happen something 
unexpected which could turn what is still even despite a million 
people a relatively orderly process into chaos or an explosion 
scowcroft said 
the separation of germany into two parts since world war ii has 
been a recurrent source of eastwest tension 
the democratic reforms sweeping the soviet bloc have rekindled 
the german question because said scowcroft there is no east 
german nation they distinguish themselves only by their political 
and economic system so that to the extent that they reform they 
undercut their reason for existence 
scowcroft predicted that soviet president mikhail s gorbachev 
in his planned dec 23 summit with president bush will not ask 
the west for massive credits for poland and hungary as they move 
out of the soviet orbit 
i dont think his intention is to throw eastern europe to the 
west to bail out said scowcroft i think he is using 
developments in poland and hungary to bolster his own attempts at 
reform 
discussing administration preparations for the gorbachev 
meeting scowcroft said were anticipating anything he could 
conceivably ask 
at the summit gorbachev would meet an angry reaction if he 
informed bush the kremlin planned to crack down to restore 
stability 
what we would do is point out to him that one of the reasons 
for the more favorable attitude of the administration of the 
american people toward the soviet union is the opening up the 
tendency toward pluralism glasnost and perestroika to the 
extent that disappears our feelings will disappear said 
scowcroft 
vice president dan quayle appearing on the nbctv program 
meet the press had the same message for moscow 
if the soviet union or any other country begins to abuse 
human rights moves in a regressive direction they would not have 
sympathy from this administration said quayle

mothers who breastfeed their babies while taking 
tranquilizers or other drugs to combat the baby blues are 
subjecting their infants to unknown health risks and should check 
with their doctors says a report issued sunday 
the report a policy statement by the american academy of 
pediatrics says use of tranquilizers such as diazepam 
antidepressants such as imipramine and 17 other similar 
medications may be of concern to nursing mothers diazepam is 
marketed as valium and imipramine is marketed as tofranil 
skpramine and imavate 
the effect of such drugs on babies who ingest them through 
breast milk is unknown said the academy an organization of 37000 
pediatricians which is based in suburban elk grove village 
its a dilemma said dr cheston berlin a member of the aap 
committee on drugs and author of the report for some of these 
women nursings important to them taking their medication is also 
going to be important 
the committee stopped short of advising women against using 
antidepressants antianxiety drugs and antipsychotics 
recommending rather that women consult their doctors 
the emphasis should be that the nursing mother discuss it with 
her physician and the two of them decide whats best for both 
mother and child said berlin who heads the general pediatrics 
division at the milton s hershey medical center hershey pa 
the report is an update of the academys 1983 statement 
it lists 130 drugs and divides them into groups those that 
should not be taken by nursing mothers those known to be safe 
those that can be used with caution those that can be used if the 
mother temporarily halts breastfeeding and those whose effects 
are unknown a newly compiled section 
the committee said the vast majority of drugs a nursing woman is 
likely to take are usually compatible with breastfeeding 
physicians should always ask themselves whether the mother 
really needs the drug in question and should choose the safest 
drug the committee said 
for example nursing women who need pain relievers should take a 
nonaspirin medication rather than aspirin which can affect an 
infants chemical balance bloodclotting or can cause a rash 
the committee also suggested physicians consider doing blood 
tests on infants of nursing mothers taking drugs that may be of 
concern and the risk from a medication may be minimized by having 
the mother take it after a feeding or before the infant is 
scheduled for its longest sleep the committee said 
jeanine klaus president of the international lactation 
consultants association praised the academys recommendation that 
each woman consult her physician 
it cushions the warnings on any particular drug putting it 
into an appropriate perspective said ms klaus whose group is 
comprised of 2000 health care professionals 
what they are saying is maintain this breastfeeding 
relationship use caution but try to maintain it she said in 
a telephone interview saturday from atlanta 
estimates on the number of women who suffer severe emotional 
problems after giving birth range from 4 percent to 10 percent but 
up to 80 percent of new mothers may have milder cases of baby 
blues she said 
julie stock a spokeswoman for la leche league international a 
franklin park illbased group that offers support and information 
for nursing mothers said many women may be incorrectly prescribed 
drugs for postpartum emotional problems 
rather than counseling a woman its easy to write a 
prescription she said 
if women gave birth in a more supportive environment and came 
home with the babies to a more supportive environment i think 
fewer women would be plunged into postpartum depression stock

sen benigno zaccagnini who headed 
italys dominant christian democratic party during its brief 
historic compromise with the communists in the 1970s died 
sunday he was 77 
zaccagnini whose political career spanned five decades and 
peaked during one of the countrys most volatile postworld war ii 
periods died in a ravenna hospital after suffering a heart attack 
born in ravenna on april 7 1912 zaccagnini was elected to

democrat premier aldo moro worked out an arrangement giving the 
communists a voice in government policies but no cabinet seats 
red brigades terrorists kidnapped moro the day the pact was 
going into force in parliament on march 6 1978 moro was killed 
after 55 days in captivity and the pact collapsed after 10 months

zaccagninis widow anna recalling so many moments of work with 
your husband in circumstances that were among the most tragic of 
our nation 
the current christian democrat secretary arnaldo forlani 
described zaccagnini as one of the most exemplary figures of the 
christian democrats and a clear reference point of our political 
life 
communist party leader achille occhetto said his contribution 
to our democracy was great

made a suprise stop at this earthquake ravaged towny to offer 
encouragement to its residents who are struggling to slowly rebuild 
their lives

said jagger who flew in by helicopter saturday along with rock 
promoter bill graham two hours before the stones concert at the 
oakland coliseum

oct 17 quake saying our hearts go out to you who suffered from 
that i know that you northern californians have an incredible 
spirit so i dont have to tell you its a wonderful place to 
live

and handed him to jagger jagger handed the child back saying 
im not a politician 
with 1400 people out of work in the downtown it affects 
everyone else people dont know quite what theyll do said 
jagger whose band has pledged 500000 to be divided between 
victims of the earthquake and hurricane hugo 
the future depends on how resilient the community is its not 
a very rich community to start with thats when it really hurts 
he said 
hundreds of watsonville residents including many impoverished 
farm workers were left homeless by the 71magnitude quake which 
killed at least 66 people in northern california 
graham said they chose watsonville because so much attention had 
been focused on san francisco jagger said he toured managua

the nations roman catholic bishops gathered in 
this city where the first american bishop was named two centuries 
ago to grapple with divisive issues of the modern age aids 
abortion and the conflict in the middle east 
leaders of the nations largest religious denomination also will 
elect a new president of the national conference of catholic 
bishops at the fourday meeting beginning monday 
archbishop daniel e pilarczyk of cincinnati conference vice 
president is expected to be elevated to the presidency while nine 
other archbishops vie for the vice presidency 
on sunday the bishops held a special bicentennial mass in the 
basilica of the assumption the nations oldest cathedral marking 
the 200th anniversary of the establishment of the diocese of 
baltimore and the appointment of the rev john carroll on nov 6 
1789 as the first us catholic bishop 
two centuries later the agenda before the leaders of the 53 
millionmember church is rife with the nations hottest social 
issues and its also getting a great deal of attention from the 
public as well 
as the mass began about 75 protesters stood outside the church 
with picket signs some pressing for abortion rights others 
supporting the churchs antiabortion stance and some arguing for 
homosexual rights within the church 
aids activists charge that a statement proposed by a bishops 
committee backing off from support of condom education in public 
schools as a way of preventing aids and teaching chastity instead 
may have deadly consequences 
to deny these children this information is abandoning them to 
death said jay blotcher a spokesman for the aids coalition to 
unleash power 
the bishops proposed statement attacks condom education as a 
quickfix approach to the aids crisis 
the revised stance came after an earlier document approved by 
the conferences administrative board came under attack for giving 
conditional approval to condom education in public schools as long 
as sexual abstinence outside of marriage was presented as the only 
medically correct and morally sure way to prevent aids 
some bishops said the original statement would be misinterpreted 
as condoning extramarital sex and artificial birth control 
another draft statement by the ad hoc committee on the middle 
east has drawn criticism from several jewish groups for its 
proposal that israel negotiate directly with palestinians over 
territory and sovereignty 
it is our conviction that a truly open moment for peace exists 
in the middle east said the committees members archbishop 
roger mahony of los angeles cardinal john oconnor of new york and 
archbishop william keeler of baltimore 
but some jewish groups charge the bishops statement offers 
premature support for a sovereign palestinian homeland 
hope for progress rests on getting the parties together 
without predetermined results said the antidefamation league of 
bnai brith which said the proposal in effect calls for a 
palestinian state 
in another proposed resolution the bishops call upon catholics 
to give urgent attention and priority to the abortion issue 
following the recent supreme court decision allowing states to set 
new limits on abortion 
at this particular time abortion has become the fundamental 
human rights issue for all men and women of good will the 
resolution states 
with church custom dictating that pilarczyk will succeed 
archbishop john l may of st louis as president of the bishops 
conference interest has turned toward the vicepresidential 
election 
candidates are archbishop anthony j bevilacqua of philadelphia 
keeler mahony archbishop eugene a marino of atlanta archbishop 
theodore e mccarrick of newark nj archbishop j francis 
stafford of denver archbishop oscar h lipscomb of mobile ala 
archbishop daniel w kucera of dubuque iowa and archbishop thomas 
c kelly of louisville ky 
among other issues the nations approximately 300 bishops are 
being asked to endorse the national black catholic pastoral plan 
which calls for broadbased participation in the church by the 
nations estimated 2 million black catholics a severe clergy 
shortage also has prompted the bishops committee on the liturgy to 
submit a proposed order for sunday celebrations in the absence of 
a priest 
in conjunction with the baltimore bicentennial the vatican lent 
the walters art gallery here a collection of priceless religious 
items given to or commissioned by medieval renaissance and baroque 
popes 
included in the exhibit which opened sunday is a gold enameled 
reliquary cross said to have held pieces of the cross on which 
christ died several illuninated manuscripts and two tapestries 
designed by the renaissance painter raphael

this small town has gained a distinction it 
would just as soon not hold the thirstiest community in kansas 
figures compiled by the state showed that in 1987 each of 
rollas 423 residents used an average of 626 gallons of water a 
day compared with the perperson 139 gallonsaday average 
statewide 
the 1988 estimates had rolla residents using 599 gallons per 
person every day 
theres no way we can be using that much water said rachael 
stewart a nutritionist in the southwest kansas city which gets 
only 16 or 17 inches of rain a year when they told us that i 
didnt know whether to start rationing water or go home and see if 
i could actually use that much 
but since rolla is one of about a dozen kansas towns without 
water meters individual usage cant be measured city clerk 
dorothy banker figures water bills based on lot size and number of 
lines to a residence most folks pay 1585 a month regardless of 
how much water they use 
places that dont meter water tend to use 50 percent to 70 
percent more water a day than cities that charge according to use 
says the kansas water office and the division of water resources 
this is the first year they sent my water report back and 
just flat said justify this said banker 
there is no penalty just embarrassment for topping the water 
usage list 
we do realize we have a problem and we have taken steps to 
alleviate it said kurt waldo rollas combined city manager 
chief of police and public works superintendent 
a voluntary plan restricting lawn watering to every other day 
was put in place in may and has shown some positive results waldo 
said we got people in the habit of turning the water off 
instead of just letting it run 
average per capita consumption dropped from 793 gallons a day in 
april to 399 gallons in june thanks in part to some timely rains 
waldo said

former sailors who served aboard the uss 
lexington in world war ii joined with the aircraft carriers crew 
over the weekend to remember shipmates who died 45 years apart 
the blue ghost association of former crew members originally 
planned its reunion to coincide with the 45th anniversary sunday of 
the day a japanese suicide plane hit the carrier and killed 47 
shipmates 
but the heartache and horror of the wartime losses were recalled 
oct 29 when a t2 buckeye training jet crashed into the lexington 
the crash killed the navy pilot and four people on the flight deck 
on sunday a navy chaplain offered prayers during shipboard 
services to console crew members 
the ship now used exclusively to train naval aviators was 
given the nickname blue ghost during the war because japanese 
propagandist tokyo rose reported it sunk several times only to 
have it reappear in its unusual uncamouflaged bluegray paint 
during a day cruise saturday that was part of the reunion plans 
sailors from two eras dropped a pair of wreaths in the gulf of 
mexico about 10 miles from where the trainer crash occurred 
its ironic said roland king of westfield mass president 
of the assocation after he and the groups vice president charles 
ryberg of waltham mass dropped one of the wreaths into the sea 
about 1500 guests including family members of the 1400 
present and former crew members crowded onto the ships flight 
deck to watch demonstration flights by various navy aircraft and a 
flyover by five t2s one of the training jets peeled off to leave 
the other four in a missingman formation 
the wreaths then were dropped overboard by the former crew 
members and the ships present skipper capt c flack logan 
ryberg said his thoughts during the ceremony turned to three 
buddies he lost in the kamikaze attack and to the lexingtons 
skipper at the time capt ernest wheeler litch 
when we were hit that day i had a chance to be up near the 
bridge and thencaptain litch ryberg said he was looking up 
and there were tears coming down from his eyes 
ryberg said he knew logan must have felt the same way after the 
crash 
they are the captains and they bleed inside ryberg said 
this captain here logan bled that day for those people

the street value of the citys largest drug 
seizure could reach nearly 1 billion by the time federal agents 
finish digging cocaine from hundreds of drums in a warehouse a 
drug agent said sunday 
the work which began with the raid of the twostory warehouse 
late friday was suspended sunday because of the new york marathon 
which runs past the buildings doors in the borough of queens 
police officers and firefighters were to resume assisting agents 
from the drug enforcement administration and the customs service on 
monday in recovering the cocaine which was buried beneath a 
caustic powder inside drums marked poison 
drug smugglers apparently hoped the powder which can open 
clogged drains and cause skin burns and lung damage would keep 
authorities from detecting the cocaine 
it just shows us how innovative the drug traffickers are 
dea agent mary cooper said 
police had searched twothirds of the 252 drums by late saturday 
and uncovered 8800 pounds of cocaine worth about 700 million on 
the street cooper said agents expect to find a total of up to 
12000 pounds 6 tons of cocaine worth up to 1 billion she 
said 
at this time the seizure appears to be in the top five 
nationwide cooper said 
it was the latest in a series of large seizures on sept 29 
agents found 214 tons of cocaine in an unguarded warehouse in the 
san fernando valley near los angeles six days later authorities 
discovered 9 tons of cocaine in a house in harlingen texas and 
about 6 tons on a panamanian ship in the gulf of mexico 
no arrests had occurred by midday sunday in connection with the 
new york raid which was prompted by an anonymous tip to the 
brooklyn district attorneys office 
the drugs were believed to be the property of the cali cartel 
one of colombias largest cocaine distributors 
newsweek magazine in its nov 5 issue said cali and other 
major cartels content in the past to distribute drugs through us 
middlemen now are distributing cocaine directly in this country to 
boost their profits 
the magazine also said the cartels combined gross revenues are 
estimated as high as 5 billion a year 
cooper said the seizure would not affect sales of cocaine on new 
york streets for at least six months if at all

legislators wrapped up work over the 
weekend on an 800 million earthquake relief package approving a 
temporary quartercent sales tax increase which gov george 
deukmejian said he would sign monday 
the governor meanwhile announced the appointment of a panel of 
earthquake and engineering experts to investigate why sections of 
interstate 880 and the bay bridge collapsed 
we also need to know whether these failures were or could 
have been predicted deukmejian said in his weekend statewide 
radio address 
the republican governor will sign the bills monday during a 
visit to san francisco said spokeswoman susie trowbridge 
several northern california legislators predicted that a 
13month quartercent increase in the sales tax won t be enough 
the tax will raise an estimated 800 million the governors office 
also plans to tap the state reserve for 200 million 
those lawmakers while lacking numbers to support their 
arguments insisted the cost of the earthquake repairs will be much 
higher than the total 425 billion in approved federal aid and 
state funds 
its going to be closer to 10 billion believe me said 
sen nick petris who urged a halfcent sales tax increase this 
is no time to be pandering to the pockets of the people 
the tax hike opposed by most republicans in the assembly 
passed the lower house saturday with only two votes to spare it 
passed the senate on a 342 vote 
why would anyone want to take advantage of this disaster to 
raise taxes asked assemblyman pat nolan one of a group of 
conservative republicans who tried to block the tax 
but deukmejian who drafted the 12point relief package with 
legislative leaders said the funds combined with federal aid 
should provide the necessary resources in order to restore some 
semblance of normalcy in the bay area 
lawmakers recessed their special earthquake session saturday 
evening postponing action until january on more than 90 other 
earthquakerelated measures introduced this week 
californias statewide sales tax is currently 6 percent 
although the tax is as high as 7 percent in parts of the state 
where local voters have approved higher levies 
the tax will aid rebuilding from the 71 magnitude quake which 
struck northern california on oct 17 killing 66 people and 
injuring more than 3000 state authorities have estimated the 
damages at more than 7 billion including some 17 billion to 
state and county roads 
one quakerelated bill in the governors package approved 
saturday would supply 194 million in grants to quake victims 
other bills would earmark money to strengthen roads and bridges 
give immediate aid to people displaced by the quake and provide tax 
breaks for owners of quakedamaged property 
a mild aftershock struck the san francisco bay area sunday 
morning 
pat jorgenson a spokeswoman with the us geological survey 
said the aftershock hit at 537 am and measured 40 on the 
richter scale according to a preliminary calculation the 
seismographic station at the university of california at berkeley 
estimated the strength at 42 on the scale 
the quake occurred on the san andreas fault and the epicenter 
was in the area of loma prieta mountain located about 8 miles 
northeast of santa cruz ms jorgenson said 
there were no reports of damage or injuries a 40 richter quake 
is capable of moderate damage near the center 
meanwhile hispanic leaders and us rep leon panetta over the 
weekend blasted federal officials saying they have ignored the 
needs of the many spanishspeaking people left homeless by the 
quake 
there is a spanish population here that needs special 
attention it demands some sensitivy the democratic 
representative from monterey said during a saturday meeting in 
santa cruz 
the meeting brought together federal state and local agencies 
working on earthquake relief programs 
fema official bob stevens told the task force that the agency 
ran out of spanishlanguage applications while serving disaster 
victims in puerto rico 
mick jagger lead singer of the rolling stones made a surprise 
stop at watsonvilles ravaged downtown and a tentcity for quake 
victims before flying by helicopter back to oakland for his steel 
wheels concert tour saturday

rebel officers who tried to oust gen 
manuel antonio noriega last month and surrendered after they failed 
were killed according to the wife of one of the leaders of the 
attempted coup 
the accusation was made in a clandestine television broadcast by 
adela de giroldi the wife of maj moises giroldi 
the broadcast was transmitted for 25 minutes on channel 12 a 
channel unused by any of the five television stations in panama 
sunday morning various radio broadcasts were interrupted by 
clandestine signals telling listeners to watch channel 12 
mrs giroldi fled to miami as did some relatives of other rebels 
i feel proud of my husband and that he died with honor mrs 
giroldi said 
they lined up my husband and the others to kill them in cold 
blood because they surrendered and without any thought they were 
murdered to those they dont like death to those they like 
death and to those they dont understand death 
gen noriega is capable of any madness of anything she 
said 
twentyseven officers were arrested after the oct 3 revolt

the country or the defense forces there are still good and honest 
officers who could command the defense forces well 
she said noriega is not fighting for nationalism hes 
fighting for his own territory his survival 
noriega has shuffled leadership posts in the defense forces 
some officers close to him were involved in the uprising noriega 
has accused the united states of trying to infiltrate the military 
encouraging young officers to overthrow the general 
washington has been putting pressure on noriega to resign since 
he was indicted on drug charges last year by two grand juries in 
florida noriega has said the accusations are false and were made 
by the united states as an excuse to abrogate the panama canal 
treaties the treaties turn control of the waterway over to panama 
before the end of the century

or who was responsibile the government did not comment on the 
broadcast

lebanese lawmakers elected a new 
christian president sunday and approved a peace plan designed to 
end 14 years of civil war despite threats by a christian general 
to punish them for conspiracy 
the legislators elected deputy rene mouawad a 32year veteran 
of lebanese politics and a 64yearold maronite christian to be 
president they first stripped the presidency of some power giving 
more authority to moslems who would fill other top government posts 
fiftyeight of parliaments 73 surviving lawmakers attended the 
special session in this northern town which is under syrian 
security on the second ballot 52 voted for mouawad and six 
abstained 
lebanon has had no president since sept 22 1988 when 
president amin gemayels sixyear term expired with parliament 
unable to decide on a successor 
the legislators also reelected parliament speaker hussein 
husseini a shiite moslem for a oneyear term he has held the 
post since october 1984 
christian leader gen michel aoun whom gemayel appointed to 
head an interim cabinet until a new president could be named 
rejected mouawads election 
what happened in kleiat is an unconstitutional act and is null 
and void aoun said in a statement issued from his command bunker 
at the presidential palace in beiruts suburb of baabda 
we are determined to thwart the conspiracy which is being 
hatched to eliminate what is left of lebanons sovereignty and 
territorial integrity he said 
aoun rejected the arab leaguebrokered peace plan first 
approved by the lawmakers at a session last month in saudi arabia 
because it failed to guarantee a withdrawal of the 40000 syrian 
troops who control much of lebanon 
he considers the syrians an occupying army and fought them for 
six months until a sept 22 ceasefire called by the arab league 
police say 930 people were killed and 2744 wounded most of them 
civilians in fierce artillery battles 
the general declared saturday that he had dissolved parliament 
most legislators declared his move illegal noting that under 
lebanons constitution only the president can dissolve parliament 
aoun has called the legislators traitors and threatened to 
punish them for approving the accord without his consent 
syria was the first foreign country to react to the election of 
mouawad whose first priority is to form a national reconciliation 
government to end the civil war 
an official source in damascus syria quoted president hafez 
assad as saying i am most glad to address to you my hearty 
congratulations what was achieved today is a great 
accomplishment on the way to end lebanons long ordeal 
in washington president bush welcomed mouawads election and 
urged aoun and other lebanese to back his efforts to end the civil 
war the state department asked all parties to refrain from 
violence and intimidation and aid president mouawad in reunifying 
lebanon 
france praised the decision and urged the lebanese to write a 
new page in their history in jiddah saudi arabia king fahd 
expressed his extreme joy at the election and appealed to the 
world community to help rebuild lebanon 
the new president the ninth since lebanons independence from 
france in 1943 was immediately sworn in underscoring parliaments 
desire to start the process of reunifying the country as quickly as 
possible 
the unanimously approved peace plan stripped the christian 
president of some power to give the prime minister and parliament 
speaker both moslems a wider share in decision making 
the peace plan shifts political power to the moslem majority 
from the christians who were believed to be in the majority when 
the existing political system was devised in the 1940s 
the 58 parliamentarians were nine more than the quorum of 49 
needed to elect a president 
in a first ballot mouawad got 35 votes short of the 49 he

a generation after medgar evers and 
martin luther king jr were killed the nations first memorial to 
martyrs of the civil rights movement was dedicated sunday as 
relatives expressed hope that young people will carry on the spirit 
of that turbulent era 
several people cried as they touched the cool water that flows 
across a circular black granite slab engraved with important events 
of the era including the names of 40 people who died in the 
struggle for racial equality 
the memorial is of the same material and by the same architect 
as the vietnam veterans memorial in washington 
i hope this will vitalize the struggle keep it fresh in the 
minds for the youth said ollie gordon a chicago 
schoolteacher whose cousin 14yearold emmett till was shot to 
death in 1955 by whites angered that he had spoken to a white woman 
i talk about martin luther king and ask why we celebrate his 
birthday and many children dont know ms gordon said 
more than 400 law enforcement officers provided security for the 
dedication ceremony which was held without incident a ku klux 
klansman from georgia tried to get a police permit to lead a 
demonstration but he was blocked by the city and a federal judge 
speakers at the ceremony included rosa parks whose refusal to 
give up her seat to a white man sparked the montgomery bus boycott 
of 195556 and relatives of those honored on the monument 
including martin luther king iii 
the struggle is not over yet the son of the civil rights 
leader told a crowd estimated by police at between 5000 and 6000 
something is wrong in a nation that doesnt set its priorities to 
take care of all its people 
relatives viewed the monument before the dedication which ended 
with thousands joining hands to sing we shall overcome 
its a very moving experience said myrlie evers of los 
angeles whose husband medgar was the highestranking naacp 
officer in mississippi when he was assassinated in 1963 it says 
to me that theres hope 
julian bond the first black state lawmaker in georgia said it 
was important to remember others besides king and evers who died in 
the struggle 
without degradating dr king this was a lot more than a 
martin luther king movement he said many were ordinary 
everyday people who rose above their ordinariness to make a 
difference 
the 700000 monument also honors james chaney andrew goodman 
and michael schwerner who were shot to death during the 1964 
freedom summer and whose slayings inspired the recent movie 
mississippi burning 
poetry in granite was how goodmans mother carolyn goodman 
of new york city described the memorial designed by maya lin 
nobody who sees it cannot feel that its a moving moving 
piece of art ms goodman said it brings that period so 
vividly alive that you can almost relive it 
the monument is in front of the southern poverty law center a 
few blocks from the alabama capitol where jefferson davis took the 
oath of office as president of the confederacy in 1861 and near 
the baptist church where king launched the montgomery bus boycott 
in 1955 
the 9foothigh granite wall is inscribed with words from the 
bible that king chose for his first speech during the bus boycott 
until justice rolls down like water and righteousness like a 
mighty stream 
king a county commissioner in atlanta said he thought his 
fathers words were very appropriate 
he said the memorial focuses attention on inequalities that 
still exist and will serve as a handson history lesson for young 
people 
perhaps they can get an understanding of why people lost their 
lives king said 
also at the ceremony was his fathers top lieutenant the rev 
ralph david abernathy who has been scorned by many black leaders 
because of his recent book which portrays the elder king as having 
a weakness for women 
the two shook hands and spoke briefly after the ceremony 
he expressed the fact that he was hurt said abernathy i 
told him that i love him and hell understand someday hopefully 
abernathy joined hands with others on the podium at the end of 
the ceremony to sing we shall overcome 
afterward the law center criticized abernathys actions saying 
he was not asked to sit on the podium or make any remarks his 
ploy was simply a cheap effort to bring himself back into the fold 
of the civil rights movement after selling out its most honored 
hero the statement said 
the law center published a 104page magazine that tells the 
story of each person named on the monument and copies were sent to 
schools around the country 
mamie till mobley of chicago emmett tills mother said she 
hoped the memorial would be an awakening for youngsters too 
young to remember when whites and blacks were forced to drink from 
separate water fountains 
it shows you that you dont have to be great just be the best 
you can be she said it doesnt take shakers and movers to 
make changes everybody can do it

democrat david dinkins clashed in campaign debate with new york 
mayoral rival rudolph giuliani on sunday while gubernatorial 
contenders sought support in virginia and new jersey in the final 
days of an offyear election season focusing on race and abortion 
weekend polls pointed to a possible democratic sweep on tuesday 
in the three most closely watched races l douglas wilder of 
virginia in his bid to become the nations first elected black 
governor dinkins in his drive to become his citys first black 
mayor and rep james florio in new jersey 
democratic chairman ron brown hailed the surveys as evidence his 
party was moving in a new direction after losing last years 
presidential campaign and is able to reach voters in the middle 
of the political spectrum 
gop chairman lee atwater said im not going to concede 
anything that would suggest he anticipated defeat for giuliani 
rep james courter in new jersey or j marshall coleman in 
virginia he noted that president bush overcame unfavorable polls 
to win a pivotal republican primary election last year on his way 
to the white house 
atwater said no matter the outcome this years campaign would 
portend little for 1990 when 34 senate seats 36 governorships and 
435 house seats are on the ballot 
on the volatile abortion issue atwater said were trying to 
be the majority party and were big enough party to have differing 
viewpoints on all issues and specifically abortion he and 
brown were interviewed on abcs this week with david brinkley 
the underdog republicans in the big races in new york virginia 
and new jersey all have been thrown on the defensive by their 
prochoice opponents on the issue of abortion the subject has 
emerged as a potent issue in the wake of a supreme court ruling 
last summer permitting tougher restrictions 
in comments underscoring the importance of race brown said 
dinkins and wilder would become leaders of national status if 
they win but he also said their fortunes would have little to do 
with the future of jesse jackson far and away the nations best 
known black politician 
the offyear ballot was crowded with hundreds of city hall city 
council and other local races as well as dozens of referendums 
from maine to california 
detroits 71yearold mayor coleman young hoped to hold off an 
unexpectedly strong challenge from 40yearold rival tom barrow 
cleveland city council president george forbes was running against 
state sen michael r white in a particularly bruising fight to 
pick that citys next mayor 
in seattle norm rice is favored to become the citys first 
black mayor while state sen john daniels is heavily favored to 
become the first black mayor of new haven conn which is 70 
percent white 
in texas 11 candidates are on the ballot to fill the unexpired 
term of the late rep mickey leland killed in an airplane crash in 
ethiopia 
but the national attention was focused on virginia new york and 
new jersey where abortion race local issues and negative 
campaign commercials proved to be a combustible mix 
wilder buoyed by a richmond timesdispatch poll reporting a 
ninepoint bulge campaigned sunday in the states coal mining 
region he told voters of the regions crucial role in his upset 
victory in the 1985 race for lieutenant governor 
if my campaign had failed in southwest virginia in 85 i 
wouldnt be standing here as the gubernatorial nominee wilder 
told a rally in grundy in 85 you gave me a start 
coleman was in northwestern part of the state to conclude a 
weekend in which he charged his rival with privately pledging to 
coal miners he would sabotage the states righttowork law by 
permitting unions to collect dues from nonunion workers covered by 
union contracts wilder says he supports the righttowork law 
its not in the bag coleman told supporters at a picnic in 
front royal were coming around the corner the undecided 
are going our way overwhelmingly 
race had largely been an unspoken issue in their campaign until 
late week when coleman said wilder was benefiting from a double 
standard in press coverage 
wilder replied saturday by appearing with housewife marie moran 
who said she had intended to vote for coleman but was switching 
because of his comment about press coverage its time for 
virginia to have a black governor she said 
the dinkinsgiuliani debate was their second in less than 24 
hours and came as a new public opinion poll reported a 5438 
advantage for the democrat 
i think the people of this town want a mayor who has nothing 
to fear from a prosecutor former us attorney giuliani said of 
his rival who concedes he failed to file income tax returns 20 
years ago and has been dogged about questions of a stock transfer 
to his son giuliani told reporters after the debate that dinkins 
needs to be investigated 
but dinkins accused his opponent of distortions and 
complaints and said he had put the stock and tax questions to 
rest he noted that three of the citys four daily papers have 
endorsed him and said of giuliani if hes the greatest thing 
since sliced bread as he argues why is it that they havent turned 
to him 
florio buoyed by a poll showing him with a lead of 24 points 
called for the election of democratic candidates to the state 
assembly where republicans have a twoseat majority unless i 
have people in the assembly that are philosophically in line with 
what ive been talking about then im going to have a mission to 
carry out with one hand tied behind my back he said 
courter dismissed the star ledgereagleton poll as he made his 
way around the state in an appearance on the brinkley program he 
accused florio of running a campaign of scurrilous ads designed 
to obscure his views on possible tax increases and other issues

president bush came back sunday to his old 
school phillips academy and lauded the rich values it taught 
him in preparation for life in general and world war ii in 
particular 
he referred to it as a special even wondrous place and 
recalled a favorite history teacher his own triumphs on the 
athletic fields and even where he was when word came that the 
japanese had bombed pearl harbor 
it was right about here where that guy in the red coat is 
standing that i heard our country was at war said bush picking 
out a figure in a stadium jacket on the fringe of the crowd about 
2500 people gathered to celebrate the 200th anniversary of the day 
another president george washington visited the school it is 
formally called phillips academy but widely known as andover 
because of its location 
andovers mission excellence in education remains as true 
in 1989 as it was when washington visited said the class of 42 
alumnus 
bush borrowed words from the constitution that founder samuel 
phillips gave his academy to describe the years he spent at the 
school 
i loved those years they did indeed teach the great end and 
real business of living he said 
if the view of the ivied campus from andover hill remained the 
same much was also different than in bushs day andover with an 
endowment of 180 million put on a display of its cultural and 
racial diversity with students from several dozen nations parading 
their flags and youths from russia africa and other lands joining 
bush in bible readings 
bush speaking at a reception after the convocation said his 
alma mater has much to be proud of its minority recruitment 
and scholarship programs have brought a new vital diversity to the 
student body 
thirteen percent of the schools 1217 students are black or 
hispanic and 10 percent are asian 
washington stopped at the then 11yearold school to see his 
friend phillips a patriot and politician who had furnished 
gunpowder to the revolutionary army later two washington nephews 
attended andover on his recommendation tuition room board and 
laundry were only 2 per week at the time 
the costs have changed a little since then but the quality 
has not bush said boarding students now pay 13500 a year but 
more than a third get financial aid 
andover all male in bushs day is now almost half female 
following a 1973 merger with its sister school abbott academy 
in another development bush said in an interview published 
sunday by the dallas morning news that vice president dan quayle 
absolutely will remain on the ticket as his running mate in 
1992 
white house chief of staff john sununu asked later sunday at a 
stop at westchester county airport in white plains ny if that 
meant bush has definitely decided to run again replied i think 
theyve been thinking in terms of an eightyear team all along i 
hope thats not a surprise to anybody 
sununu added with a laugh i need the job 
bush stopped there to visit with his 88yearold mother dorothy 
walker bush for about an hour at her home in greenwich conn 
before flying back to washington 
bush made the nostalgic visit to andover without his wife 
barbara who returned to the white house directly from camp david 
because of a flulike illness 
david m underwood a houston stockbroker who is president of 
andovers trustees hailed bush as an embodiment of the spirit of 
non sibi the schools latin motto not for myself 
bush said it is in school as it was for me here at phillips 
academy that we come to understand real values 
the president recalled that at his graduation in june 1942 
just before he enlisted in the navy to become a combat pilot 
secretary of war henry stimson observed the american soldier 
should be brave without being brutal selfreliant without 
boasting becoming a part of inestimable might without losing faith 
in individual liberty i never forgot those words

the conservative new democracy party led 
in national elections sunday but narrowly missed a parliamentary 
majority throwing greece into its second period of political 
uncertainty in five months 
with 962 percent of the votes counted new democracy led by 
constantine mitsotakis had 463 percent it was followed by former 
premier andreas papandreous panhellenic socialist movement with 
407 percent and the coalition of the left and progress headed by 
communist harilaos florakis with 108 percent the rest went to 
small parties official returns were broadcast by state television 
new democracy needed 151 seats in the 300seat singlechamber 
parliament to control the government after eight years of socialist 
rule and a brief coalition administration 
government projections showed new democracy with 148 seats 128 
seats going to the socialists and 21 to the leftist coalition the 
other three seats would go to independents including one 
environmentalist 
a tough period of bargaining was expected to begin shortly on 
forming a new government the leading parties are widely divided 
over such major issues as economic policy and the presence of us 
military bases in greece 
mitsotakis told a news conference his party would act in a way 
that is best for the nation but did not spell out his plans for 
working out a coalition without a doubt our political life is 
entering a difficult phase he said 
papandreou said it gives us special satisfaction that after 
the june elections we have had such a significant rise despite 
the unbelievable barrage of attacks made against us and despite the 
fact that we were out of the government 
papandreous party did not appear to be damaged by its leaders 
indictment on corruption charges in september 
polls were open from sunrise to sunset with voting compulsory 
for the estimated 8 million citizens aged 18 and over final 
results were unlikely before monday afternoon 
in athens motorists waving green socialist party banners or 
blueandwhite new democracy flags sped through the central 
syntagma square leaning on their horns 
although a national election june 18 produced no majority the 
coalition of the left and progress agreed to team with its enemies 
the conservatives in a shortterm government dedicated only to 
investigating scandals that dogged the final years of the 198189 
socialist administration 
the coalition government resigned last month after indicting 
papandreou on charges of involvement in a multimilliondollar 
banking scandal and of ordering wiretapping of the telephones of 
friends and foes 
papandreou has said he is innocent and maintains the indictments 
were politically motivated 
the leader of the communistled coalition florakis said it 
is an undisputed fact that the coalition will be at the center of 
postelectoral developments in our country 
florakis group wants to evict us bases from greece and 
opposes extraditing a palestinian suspected of terrorism mohammed 
rashid to the united states 
mitsotakis 71 campaigned on promises to cut the governments 
heavy role in the economy and strengthen ties with nato and the 
united states he accused the former government of ruining the 
economy citing a 58 billion public debt 
papandreou 70 promised to boost pensions and other benefits if 
elected and to hold a public referendum before approving any new 
base treaty with the united states 
greeces simple proportional system makes it difficult for 
parties to gain an overall majority in june new democracy won 145 
seats the socialists got 125 seats the coalition got 28 seats and 
two went to independents 
many observers said before sundays elections that greece could 
face a period of political instability even if one party won a 
majority 
that is because parliament must elect a new president in march 
while the president is largely a figurehead and has far fewer 
powers than the prime minister greek law dictates that parliament 
must be dissolved and new elections held if no candidate can muster 
threefifths of the vote in parliament 
one voting irregularity was reported the spokesman for the 
caretaker government nikos themelis said authorities were

the newly reformed social democratic 
party ended a threeday congress sunday unable to resolve 
ideological differences that led one faction to split from the 
party the day before 
party faithful expressed hope the split would end months of 
wrangling that had paralyzed party efforts to prepare for the first 
free elections since 1948 
the roots of the partys ideological struggle go back to 1948 
when the social democratic party bowed to pressure from the 
communists and farleft social democrats and was absorbed by the 
communist party 
the party was briefly revived during the 1956 antistalinist 
revolution but disappeared again after soviet tanks invaded and 
reestablished communist domination it reformed this year 
following the nowdefunct communist partys decision to permit 
opposition parties and prepare for multiparty elections next year 
the communist party dissolved itself oct 7 and reconstituted 
itself as the hungarian socialist party but many social democrats 
mindful of the 1948 fusion remain mistrustful of the true political 
beliefs both of the new party and of those they see as seeking to 
cross over to the social democratic party 
the break occurred saturday when gyoergy ruttner a communist 
party member as recently as january walked out followed by about 
40 delegates to an alternate conference site that was rented in 
anticipation of the split 
the breakway faction has announced that it is going to organize 
the independent social democratic party which will be to the left 
of the main faction 
the split followed heated debate on whether to represent classic 
worker interests or be closer to social democratic positions found 
in western europe 
party spokeswoman anna petrasovits told reporters that social 
democratic aims included a liberal economy strong unionism 
social security 
like warsaw pact ally poland hungary has made dizzying moves in 
the past year to break with its socialist past by establishing 
democratic economic and social reforms and improve ties to the 
west 
the parliamentary elections are to be scheduled by june

the boeing co defended its new offer in the 
monthold machinists strike as an excellent package and said it 
was final but union negotiators said it actually took away from 
the aerospace giants offer made in october 
boeing will find that our members are angry and determined not 
to be insulted and degraded by takeaways and phony number games 
tom baker president of machinists union district lodge 751 said 
at a news conference 
boeings chief negotiator larry mckean said at a separate news 
conference that the company has offered all it will and the union 
should let members vote although the overall amount of money was 
unchanged mckean said the latest offer addressed employees desire 
for better lump sum payments and retirement benefits and less 
overtime 
they have our best proposal mckean said this is our 
final offer 
the union has no intention of putting the insulting offer to 
its members because reductions in costofliving increases made it 
less attractive than last months proposal baker said 
really its a takeaway he said 
baker said he didnt expect any new talks this week the 
company knows what we want he said as soon as they want to 
talk well be here 
talks broke off abruptly saturday after almost a week of daily 
negotiations federal mediator douglas hammond said no further 
talks were scheduled 
machinists international vice president justin ostro accused the 
company of raising employees hopes by talking last week even 
though it had no intention of putting more money on the table 
boeing will pay with years of lower productivity if it loses the 
faith of its workers he said 
this company is going to pay a very very terrible price by 
this strike ostro said 
union members picketing in seattle appeared split on whether the 
latest boeing offer should be sent to the membership 
that sounds like a good offer to me said barb mccallick 
65 of des moines a seattle suburb 
they can afford more than that said beatrice moreno 26 of 
seattle if we dont stand up now we wont get anything 
saturday was the sixth straight day of facetoface 
negotiations after hammond met separately with both sides last 
sunday hammond had said he hoped to keep both sides at the table 
until an agreement could be reached 
the strike began oct 4 the day after the union representing 
57800 boeing workers voted down the threeyear contract offer 
that offer included annual pay raises of 4 percent 3 percent 
and 3 percent and bonuses of 8 percent of gross pay in the first 
year and 3 percent in the second there also were costofliving 
increases to virtually cover inflation a reduction in mandatory 
overtime from 200 to 160 hours per quarter and higher benefits 
boeing spokesman paul binder said the new offer contained the 
same wage increases but boosted the lump sum payments to 10 
percent the first year 4 percent the second year and 4 percent the 
third year 
however binder said that while there were changes the overall 
value of the offer was essentially the same as that of the offer 
rejected oct 3 
the union has said all along it wants more money 
the machinists represent 43300 boeing workers inthe local 
district 751 lodge 12000 in wichita kan 1700 in portland 
ore and a few hundred at scattered sites in california hawaii

republican mayoral hopeful rudolph giuliani 
well behind in the polls with only two days to go called democrat 
david dinkins dishonest sunday and promised to investigate his 
financial dealings if elected 
dinkins bristled at what he called giulianis distortions and 
complaints and said he had put to rest questions about a stock 
transfer to his son and his failure to file income taxes 20 years 
ago 
dinkins who is seeking to become the citys first black mayor 
also pointed out that three of new yorks four daily newspapers 
have endorsed him 
those editorial boards know me and know mr giuliani and 
selected dinkins he said in the opening minutes of a lively and 
often contentious televised debate the second and final one of the 
campaign 
if hes the greatest thing since sliced bread as he argues 
why is it that they havent turned to him dinkins said 
the latest poll conducted for the daily news and wabctv shows 
dinkins leading giuliani by 54 percent to 38 percent the poll had 
a margin of error of plus or minus 5 percentage points 
the winner of tuesdays election will succeed mayor ed koch who 
lost the democratic primary to dinkins 
seeking to make up ground giuliani opened sundays debate 
aggressively hitting hard at dinkins personal finances 
the former us attorney charged that dinkins was involved in a 
coverup by failing to follow through on a promise to make public 
more details of the stock transfer to his son giuliani has 
questioned whether dinkins significantly undervalued the stock in 
the transfer 
referring to dinkins charge in their first debate saturday 
night that new yorkers need a mayor not a prosecutor giuliani 
said i think the people of this town want a mayor who has 
nothing to fear from a prosecutor 
talking to reporters afterward giuliani said he would launch a 
city investigation into dinkins finances if elected 
i think it is now quite clear that he does not have the 
honesty and integrity that commends him to the voters giuliani 
said 
told of giulianis pledge dinkins brushed it off saying i 
suppose he just cant get the prosecutor out of himself he seems 
not to realize that hes running for mayor 
during the debate dinkins accused giuliani of flipflopping on 
abortion by saying that although he personally opposed it he would 
continue city funding for abortions for poor women 
giuliani said his position was similar to that of other 
catholics like gov mario cuomo and sen edward kennedy dmass

vladimir horowitz the russianborn virtuoso who 
brought controlled thunder to the piano in a glorious career 
that spanned most of the century died sunday at his home he was 
85 
his manager peter gelb said horowitz died in the early 
afternoon of a heart attack at his home in manhattan 
he said horowitz had been in good health and as recently as last 
week was recording his living room transformed into a studio as 
was his custom less than three weeks ago hundreds of admirers 
filled a record store for an albumsigning session 
horowitzs last public performances were in the spring of 1987 
in berlin hamburg west germany and amsterdam netherlands gelb 
said the year before he had returned to moscow for the first time 
in 61 years for an emotional memorable concert shown on american 
television 
his final american performances were in the fall of 1986 gelb 
said when he played at new yorks lincoln center and the reopening 
of the refurbished carnegie hall 
he is survived by his wife of 56 years wanda the daughter of 
the famed conductor arturo toscanini 
in a letter of condolence to mrs horowitz composer and 
conductor leonard bernstein called the temperamental pianist this 
amazing man 
he was not only a super pianist but a super musician with all 
the mortal fallibilities such geniuses have bernstein wrote 
pianist andre watts said it would be hard to come up with an 
equivalent there isnt another horowitz thank god for 
recordings he likened him to a demon barely under control out 
there on the stage 
often hailed as one of the greatest concert pianists horowitz 
left russia in 1925 and came to the united states in 1928 playing 
his first american concert seven days later 
he received the presidential medal of freedom the nations 
highest civilian award in 1986 the legion of honor from france and 
italys order of merit he also was the recipient of more than 20 
grammy awards 
horowitz was the model for a generation of pianists and the 
highestpaid classical pianist in the world by 1978 he was called 
a national treasure by president carter 
indeed horowitz three times played the white house first at 
herbert hoovers request second at carters on the occasion of 
the 50th anniversary of the pianists arrival in the united states 
in 1978 and the third in october 1986 for president reagan 
we are saddened at the loss of this world renowned musician 
a white house statement said sunday we extend our sympathies to 
his family his musical legacy will continue to live on 
the honors were bestowed on the man one music critic described 
as possessing all the color resource in the world and a sonority 
that is unparalleled in the history of piano playing 
horowitz whose sartorial trademark was a sporty bow tie was 
known for his intense electric performances his technique and 
skill his rich interpretations speed and a power described as 
controlled thunder his style of playing and choice of 
repertoire led him to be dubbed the last great romantic pianist 
he himself called playing the piano as the coordination of 
mind heart and finger with emotion the key 
the brain is the control of emotion there has to be something 
to be controlled the heart is the guide the brain is the control 
what comes out had to have both he once said 
the drama that ruled his performances also guided his career 
which he often interrupted for long periods the first time from 
1936 to 1939 following an illness and the second from 1953 to 
1965 for reasons never explained 
he continued to make records during the second retirement happy 
to be away from the wearying pace of the concert circuit he also 
served as mentor to five concert pianists who later told of the 
complex relationship that evolved between them and their volatile 
teacher 
horowitz forbade his students to say they were studying under 
him he would often cancel lessons and normally taught while 
stretched on his living room couch his students also said the 
pianist was unable to transmit the secret of his techniques and 
called him a man of extremes from his music to his moods 
the demon inside me that urged him to do better and a 
desire to perform in public again brought him back to the concert 
stage when he was 61 with what critics said was a new maturity and 
a wider range 
when he returned to carnegie hall in 1965 music lovers demanded 
four encores and refused to leave the concert hall even after the 
lights were dimmed 
the pace of his concerts continued to slow as he grew older but 
his reputation was undiminished when he returned to the soviet 
union in april 1986 determined fans rushed police and stormed his 
moscow concert and open rehearsal

the pianist was born vladimir gorowicz on oct 1 1904 on 
kievs music street his father simeon was a prosperous engineer 
impoverished by the russian revolution his mother sophie bodik 
was a good amateur pianist who instilled such a love of music in 
her three children that daughter regina also became a concert 
pianist and son georg a violin teacher 
horowitz was given piano lessons when he was 6 and made moderate 
progress until age 9 when he stunned his parents by learning all 
the rachmaninoff pieces in the family library and all the piano 
scores of wagners operas he attended the kiev conservatory where 
from age 12 to 16 he studied piano and composition under felix 
blumenfeld 
he made his concert debut at age 19 seeking a way to earn money 
for his family 
in 1925 when he was idolized in petrograd now leningrad and 
even had a fan club known as the green girls for their 
cardigans horowitz left the soviet union on a sixmonth visa to 
study in the west his stay away lasted 61 years 
horowitz won international fame in 1926 during a berlin concert 
series and continued to tour europe soloing under all the great 
conductors he made his american debut in january 1928 and was an 
instant success 
in 1933 he was chosen to solo for conductor toscaninis last in 
a series of beethoven concerts toscanini also introduced horowitz 
to his daughter at the end of the year they were married in milan 
and settled in a townhouse on manhattans upper east side he 
became a us citizen 
horowitz only real rival for acclaim and popularity was artur 
rubinstein who died in 1982 rubinstein conceded that horowitz was 
the better pianist but not the better musician 
the concerts in the moscow and leningrad were part of a renewed 
ussoviet cultural exchange 
horowitz was a longtime critic of the soviet system i dont 
like the russian approach to music to art to anything and 
repeatedly said he would never return his family property was 
confiscated after his defection and it was years before a few of 
his recordings were released there 
but when he decided to return taking along his steinway it was 
obvious his countrymen had not forgotten him it was the most 
talkedabout musical event in the soviet union in years 
though the visit received sparse if positive coverage in the 
official media hundreds of students unable to get tickets charged 
into the concert hall in moscow and joined a vipladen audience in 
giving him a thundering ovation the concert was broadcast live in 
the united states by cbstv and later shown on soviet television 
in leningrad horowitz got a sevenminute standing ovation in 
the audience was the last surviving green girl 
they are very sweet to me here he said 
horowitz preferred to perform on sunday afternoons and rarely 
practiced more than two hours a day 
i have practiced enough in my life he said the most 
important thing is the spirit 
he traveled with his favorite videocassettes and occasionally 
visited new yorks trendy nightclubs not for the disco music 
which he blocked with ear plugs but for the change 
neighbors became used to seeing him strolling near central park 
those walks were once recommended by his idol and early discoverer 
rachmaninoff the russian master horowitz said once told him 
if you dont walk your fingers will not run

brazil and argentina the ailing 
giants of south america are trying to salvage their crumbling 
economies by starting a common market modeled after europe and the 
united states 
the traditional rivals say cooperation is the only way for latin 
america to head off economic disaster 
there arent many options either we work out a joint strategy 
in line with our development needs or we will be the objects of 
outside strategies argentine president carlos menem told 
brazils congress during a threeday visit in august 
burdened by stagnant growth fourdigit inflation and a combined 
foreign debt of some 170 billion brazil and argentina have 
knocked down some trade barriers and recently agreed to boost trade 
and cooperation to unprecedented levels 
the idea is not new in the last three decades an array of 
organizations the latin american association of free commerce the 
andean pact the latin american development association and most 
recently the latin american economic system were devised to 
unite latin american economies 
all failed mostly because of excessive protectionism 
nationalism and cultural antagonism 
but this time around latin american leaders say they can lick 
the problem by starting small 
tiny uruguay which borders the two giants recently joined 
brazil and argentina in the common market scheme now these three 
countries hope to attract other nations to the fold or at least 
set an example for other regional trade blocs 
its the only way for latin america to create a common 
market said helio jaguaribe director of research at rio de 
janeiros institute of political and social research the 
brazilargentina accords have become a spotlight for other 
countries to follow 
the renewed interest in a latin common market was sparked by the 
growth of trade alliances in western europe between the united 
states and canada and between japan and its asian neighbors 
analysts say 
integration is fundamental fernando collor de mello 
brazils leading presidential candidate said recently latin 
america cannot be left out of this new world order 
increasingly the regions leaders are dismantling or selling 
off the powerful but often inefficient staterun enterprises and 
turning to free market principles 
the return of civilian regimes in much of latin america also has 
helped foster mutual trust and economic liberalism that was lacking 
under military rule when generals were more concerned with 
national security 
the old military governments hardly wanted to share their 
secrets or strengths with their neighbors said paulo rabello de 
castro a private economic consultant in rio and managing editor of 
the respected financial monthly conjutora economica he said that 
mutual suspicion no longer exists 
indeed menem and sarney recently signed agreements to swap 
military space and nuclear technology and increase cultural 
exchange programs 
the growth of latin american industry also will boost 
integration economists say 
nations such as venezuela chile brazil and argentina are no 
longer as dependent on foreign technology as they were 30 years 
ago today they can trade a wide variety of products and resources 
without foreign assistance 
the integration gears are meshing de castro said by 
early next century a common market scheme could be in place 
complete with a regional judiciary system 
but large hurdles remain 
the current economic woes of argentina and brazil have left 
those countries without the funds needed to support and finance a 
continentwide market said economist carlos alberto primo braga a 
visiting professor at the johns hopkins school of advanced 
international studies 
its hard to achieve integration when the regions economies 
are in recession said economist celso furtado a former 
brazilian planning minister the last thing fragile internal 
industries will want is competition from other countries 
many analysts say economic growth needed to foster a common 
market will only start when the continents 440 billion foreign 
debt becomes less of a burden 
argentina is virtually bankrupt and 45 billion behind in 
payments on its 60 billion foreign debt 
even brazil which boasts the worlds eighth biggest economy and 
the third largest trade surplus spends most of its export earnings 
to pay interest on its 110 billion foreign debt the third worlds 
largest 
to ease the burden latin leaders are considering proposals to 
swap foreign debt to create a latin american common market fund 
according to aloizio mercadante oliva professor of economics at 
sao paulos catholic university 
another obstacle is the lack of a strong local currency the 
value of brazils new cruzado drops daily and argentinas austral 
has plummeted more than 97 percent against the us dollar in the 
last five months 
wed have a tough time trading even shoe laces with our funny 
money said rabello de castro 
to cope with the funny money problem brazil and argentina 
have a 500 million reciprocal credit agreement under which they 
import and export each others products without the use of currency 
large trade imbalances between nations and a reluctance to loan 
cash and share technology continue to impede integration analysts 
say 
indeed since south americas two largest trading partners 
announced their common market plans in 1985 brazil has run up a 
500 million trade surplus with argentina 
but that too may be changing brazil in august agreed to accept 
up to 350 million worth of argentinefinanced projects for 
transportation hospital construction and hydroelectric equipment

for all the stock markets seemingly manic 
behavior lately some analysts see a message behind its madness 
amid the controversies over program trading and corporate 
takeovers stock traders sometimes appear to have veered off on a 
throughthelooking glass digression from what is taking place 
elsewhere in the economy 
but at the same time close followers of the financial scene 
say the market has taken on an increasingly powerful role not 
just in reacting to economic trends and government policies but 
also in helping to determine them 
ever since the crash of 1987 these analysts note the federal 
reserve has been forced to give a lot of weight to the state of the 
stock market in setting its credit policies 
legislators too have effectively been put on notice that they 
cant start changing rules for instance on taxes corporate 
takeovers or foreign investment in this country without taking 
into account how stock investors might react 
the implicit penalty for a misstep on any of these matters is a 
sudden drop in stock prices that threatens farreaching trouble for 
the domestic and world economies not to mention for any 
policymakers who wind up taking the blame 
this vigilante effect first gained wide attention in the 
bond market in the early 1980s 
in the view of many analysts the large amorphous group of 
people who invest in bonds became increasingly fearful that the 
federal reserve wasnt doing enough to restrain inflation 
so they collectively refused to bid for bonds until interest 
rates reached levels that restrained the growth of credit 
their market actions encouraged or some would say compelled 
central banks to tighten to slow economic growth and prevent any 
inflation resurgence said robert barbera economist at shearson 
lehman hutton inc 
today we contend it is stock market reaction to tootight 
monetary policy that at times influences monetary policy and that 
reduces somewhat the risk of global recession 
thus in the second half of the 1980s stock market vigilantes 
have replaced the bond market vigilantes of the first half 
analysts say this shift was clearly demonstrated in the 
aftermath of black monday oct 19 1987 the fed which had been 
tightening credit before stocks crashed abruptly began to supply 
assurances of plentiful amounts of money 
in addition a bill that had been taking shape in congress to 
discourage some forms of takeover activity was shelved 
another severe selloff on friday oct 13 of this year once 
again drew signals from the fed that it would provide whatever 
liquidity was necessary to stave off a market collapse 
as time passes the fed continues to watch the stock market 
said darwin beck economist at first boston corp 
all this naturally raises several issues who appointed bond and 
stock traders to these positions of power can they be trusted to 
use it wisely or even responsibly if they dont to whom do they 
have to account 
the answer to any of those questions depends to a great extent 
on the respondents point of view 
defenders of the vigilantes say they are unlikely ever to engage 
in any sort of conspiracy given their sheer diversity and the fact 
that they compete against each other for their livelihoods 
skeptics on the other hand can cite the history of the 1980s 
as conclusive evidence of the susceptibility of unfettered markets 
to abuse of many kinds 
on one point however most observers agree the modern 
financial vigilante is a product of an era when many governments 
around the world have promoted free markets as the best means of 
making societies and economies work 
the activities of the stockmarket vigilantes now promise to be 
studied in the future as a test of whether that premise is right

starting jan 1 parents can take advantage of a 
savings bond program that will allow them to put away money for 
their childrens college education taxfree 
the program involves the us treasurys series ee savings 
bonds which have been around for years the difference is that 
federal tax on the bonds interest will be forgiven if the proceeds 
are used for tuition savings bonds always are exempt from state 
and local taxes 
the program is limited to residents at least 24 years old who 
meet certain income requirements married couples with adjusted 
gross incomes of 60000 a year and under and single people with 
incomes of 40000 and under 
for those with higher incomes the taxdeductibility is reduced 
according to a scale married couples with incomes of 90000 and 
over and singles with incomes of 55000 or more cannot participate 
the bonds may only be bought by parents for their children 
other relatives may not participate 
using savings bonds to put away money for college education has 
long been popular but the 1986 federal tax code revision made it 
less advantageous 
before the tax law changes parents typically would buy bonds in 
their childs name and declare the interest as income on tax forms 
filed for their children this way the child usually would pay no 
tax since the interest income would be lower than the childs 
minimum taxable income 
however the revised code taxes children under age 14 at their 
parents marginal tax rate instead of at the childrens rate that 
eliminated some of the tax advantage 
the new program should restore the popularity of savings bonds 
for college tuition funding said stephen meyerhardt a spokesman 
for the treasurys savings bond program 
he said the new program is simpler than the traditional way of 
putting away college funds in bonds because there is no need to 
file annual tax forms for the children 
instead the bonds will be bought in the parents names and 
interest will only be declared when a bond is cashed in to pay for 
tuition he said the internal revenue service is still working on 
rules for how this interest will be excluded from taxation 
series ee treasury bonds sell for half their face value the 
face value is paid at maturity they can be bought for as little as 
25 and are sold at most banks and savings and loans 
meyerhardt said the treasury has been deluged with inquiries 
about the program obviously the potential audience is huge 
he said last week 
while university officials generally praise the savings plan 
they say they wish it had been extended to grandparents and 
students as well 
richard f rosser president of the national association of 
independent colleges and universities agreed there should be great 
demand for the program 
its simple and its uncomplicated he said this may very 
well become an important savings program for just taking it out of 
your monthly wages people have bought ee bonds for years through 
payroll deductions 
this is not the first college bond program several states have 
marketed some of their normal state revenue bonds as tuition 
savings bonds 
these bonds like treasury bonds are zerocoupon bonds meaning 
there is no annual interest payment or coupon thats why 
theyre sold at a discount with their face amount paid at maturity 
in washington state a 50 million initial offering quickly sold 
out last year said edward palmer a first vice president at 
security pacific bank washington the lead manager for the bonds 
though a 200 million issue this year was not a sellout palmer 
said the state and the bank consider the program extremely 
successful 
you really feel like youre doing something for people 
palmer said 
among other states that have issued college savings bonds are 
illinois and north carolina

the gritty freight trains that pass by 
the office building help keep work in perspective for r redding 
stevenson jr 
the groaning engines and clatter of boxcars offer are a sharp 
contrast to the sleek design and sophisticated features proposed 
for what could be the nations fastest train network but they also 
remind stevenson of how little trains are used to carry passengers 
particularly in the carclogged sunbelt 
theres a lot of people whove never even been on a train let 
alone use one to commute or go on trips said stevenson 
president of florida high speed rail corp the only company left 
seeking the 22 billion project to connect miami orlando and 
tampa with a train capable of traveling at 150 mph 
as our roads get more congested as airport delays become more 
routine rail looks more and more like the option for the future 
the boca ratonbased consortium of more than 30 firms from 
rail designers to real estate planners appears virtually certain 
of receiving the state contract for the highspeed project after 
last weeks withdrawal of its sole competitor tgv of florida inc 
a subsidiary of the french bullet train operators 
the florida high speed rail commission has asked the company to 
develop more detailed plans for the construction and operation of 
the 300mile system the final contract should be awarded next year 
we are truly seeing history in the making said commission 
chairman malcolm kirschenbaum in orlando last week 
stevenson a former real estate developer was joined the 
project in the initial stages as a consultant and ended up 
conductor 
in the early 1980s montrealbased bombardier inc was among an 
international group of companies with interest in the florida 
project as an incentive to bidders the state offered exclusive 
real estate development rights along much of the rail line and 
bombardier sought out amerifirst development corp one of 
floridas largest home builders 
when bombardier dropped out stevenson then an amerifirst 
executive approached asea brown boveri a multinational firm 
heavily involved in highspeed rail technology the corporation was 
formed in 1986 
the companys plans call for steelwheel trains rather than the 
more experimental magneticlevitation systems used in japan that 
can exceed 200 mph but stevenson said magnetic trains could be 
used as feeders to some of the 13 proposed stations 
to promote business travel stevenson envisions officetype cars 
used on some european trains with computers telephones copiers 
and facsimile machines 
stevenson also says the rail system will court the states 
estimated 50 million annual tourists many heading for cruise ports 
or disney world where a magneticlevitation train connection to 
orlando international airport is planned for the early 1990s 
we have to make the trip enjoyable for everyone from 
tourists to business travelers or else we wont have any 
riders he said but that shouldnt be hard its no fun 
driving in most places now its not that fun to fly and i dont 
think there are many people who like taking the bus whats left 
the trains could be rolling as early as 1994 with fares from 
miami to tampa between 30 to 69 stevenson said 
meanwhile he believes rail travel will become more attractive 
as traffic snarls and gridlock worsen around florida one of the 
nations fastest growing states 
there is no way we can build enough roads to keep pace with 
traffic demands said stevenson but what we do have is an 
infrastructure of 200000 miles of track around the country ready 
to be used 
worldwide there are between 2500 and 3000 miles of highspeed 
rail including the 125 mph amtrak link from washington to new 
york said raul bravo a rail consultant working on a proposed 
european rail network that could add more than 15000 miles to the 
highspeed system by the year 2000 
amtrak last year reported a record 215 million passengers and 
similar projections are being made for 1989 said spokesman 
clifford black 
weve ignored the train for about 40 years said stevenson 
thats too long

the modern consumer movement that naders 
raiders spawned 20 years ago in washington is quietly thriving at 
the grassroots level and braced for the challenges of the next 
decade advocates say 
the movement is more diverse and has a lower profile than when 
ralph nader led 250 students from the countrys top schools to 
washington to research what if anything government was doing for 
consumers advocates say but they contend that the movement is 
every bit as strong and influential 
its not as visible its not as much here but its spread 
into the hustings said robert fellmeth one of seven lawyers 
dubbed naders raiders in january 1969 
they earned the tag after presenting a welldocumented report of 
inaction by the federal trade commission which then had primary 
responsibility for consumer protection 
the proliferation of consumer advocacy organizations since then 
is a testament to the health of their movement says veteran raider 
clarence ditlow 
were almost as big and varied as the government said 
ditlow who heads the center for auto safety which has lead the 
fight for standard safety features such as seat belts and air bags 
in cars and whose annual car report has become a mainstay for 
buyers 
naders raiders and their associates have founded or helped to 
establish more than 35 different consumer advocacy groups 
according to a statement distributed at a recent 20th anniversary 
conference 
fellmeth a law professor at the university of san diego said 
that in its infancy the movement focused on direct political and 
legislative action at the federal level 
the advocates acknowledge they made few advances after ronald 
reagan was elected president in 1980 being forced instead to 
protect the statutes and agencies they had helped create against 
his antigovernment philosophy 
we could not have envisioned reagan putting the 1980s on hold 
while he built a government of the exxon by the gm for the 
duponts said nader in a wry parody of the constitutions 
preamble 
consumer activists say legislation is needed to renew and 
strengthen the mandate of the consumer product safety commission 
which has not been reauthorized by congress since its 1972 
inception 
while calling for a stronger federal hand groups have shifted 
much of their emphasis to the state and local level 
its begun to have a grassroots kind of entity and its now 
begun to spread into state capitals and its become more of a 
direct democracy said fellmeth at the recent raider reunion 
i think youre going to be seeing the consequences of that 
groundwork in the 1990s predicted fellmeth 
some point to stricter state than federal laws against 
pesticides on foods state consumer utility boards consumer 
representation on public utility commissions and programs like 
floridas time dollarservice exchange as harbingers of the future 
efforts 
health care on the other hand has the highest priority on the 
national consumer agenda the activists say issues to be resolved 
are who delivers it who makes treatment decisions how to control 
costs and how to provide longterm and catastrophic care 
nader and others say there also needs to be a greater push for 
group buying associations and publiclyfinanced possibly elected 
consumer representation before federal and state regulatory 
agencies 
nader also points out that publiclyfinanced campaigns and an 
end to honoraria for elected officials remain on the agenda 
still others like chuck hill of the consumer law center and 
mark silberfeld of consumers union say more emphasis will have to 
be put on the concerns of lowincome people 
meanwhile traditional consumer organizations have allied 
themselves with adversaries on specific issues 
consumer federation of america and the us public interest 
research group recently joined with the association of american 
trial lawyers to warn the public about a potentially dangerous 
drain cleaner the american insurers association has joined with 
several consumers groups and is bankrolling the newlycreated 
advocates for highway and auto safety 
these shifting coalitions as silberfeld termed them are a 
part of a more sophisticated approach that consumer advocates are 
likely to continue

the government has cheated itself out of 
millions of dollars by misinterpreting legislation that specifies 
who uses federally subsidized water says a report released monday 
by the general accounting office 
the congressman who wrote the law blames the interior department 
and the gao advises congress to close loopholes that let interior 
interpret the law the way it does 
the law was written for states where water is scarce 
essentially the west farmers in california have been the greatest 
beneficiaries of the loopholes 
wealthy farmers in californias central valley have subverted 
the intent of federal water laws and top interior department 
officials aware of the abuse declined to take corrective action 
said rep george miller dcalif 
miller said he rewrote the law in 1982 governing the cost of 
federal water to western farmers so that large farms would receive 
a limited amount of cheap federally subsidized water 
only farms of 960 acres or less would be eligible 
but owners of large farms got around the law by reorganizing 
into 960acre tracts that qualified for the subsidies 
congressional expectations have not been met said the gao 
which is congress investigative arm 
for all practical purposes these smaller landholdings 
continue to be operated collectively as single large farms much as 
they were before being reorganized said the investigators 
report 
the interior department however said it is following 
congressional intent 
were carrying out the law said joe hunter spokesman for 
the interior departments bureau of reclamation hunter said he had 
not seen the gao report and did not want to comment on specifics in 
it 
however the report itself tends to back up hunters contention 
that the agency is meeting its legal requirement interior 
cautioned that it is not convinced that the congress expected to 
apply the 960acre limit to land being operated as one unit the 
report said 
the gao believes that by amending the act as gao recommends 
the congress will make clear its expectations said the report 
the interior department also told the gao it did not see the 
laws purpose as a method of enhancing government revenues 
when gao investigators looked into the books of farmers who had 
subdivided to see how much money was being saved they found four 
cases in which the owners or lessees were able to pay a total of 
about 13 million less in 1987 for the federal irrigation water 
than they would have paid if their respective multiple landholdings 
had been considered as large farms 
this 13 million represents reduced revenues to which the 
federal government would have been entitled and these reduced 
revenues likely will continue to occur annually unless the act is 
amended the gao report said

savings and loan executives gathering sunday for 
their 97th annual convention at the close of the industrys most 
traumatic year since the depression are bracing for more tough 
times ahead 
three months after congress authorized 50 billion to close or 
rescue an estimated 500 failed sampls the stillsolvent survivors 
face the prospect of shrinking balance sheets takeover by 
commercial banks and increasingly stiffer competition in what many 
economists expect will be a sluggish home financing market 
the legislation signed by president bush on aug 9 provided one 
immediate and substantial benefit to the industry it closed failed 
institutions or replaced their highcost deposits with federal 
money relieving healthy sampls of the burden of competing by 
matching the high rates 
but the new law also imposes tough new capital requirements on 
thrifts that will protect taxpayers by forcing sampl owners to back 
their lending with more of their own money but it has the industry 
scrambling 
according to james barth chief economist of the federal office 
of thrift supervision nearly 1000 of 2600 solvent sampls 
nationwide holding 60 percent of the industrys assets are short 
of capital that does not include the nearly 300 already seized by 
the government 
institutions can meet the new standards in three ways by 
retaining profits by attracting outside investors or by shrinking 
so far most capitaldeficient thrifts are choosing the third 
option 
few have profits to retain the industry as a whole lost 72 
billion in the first six months of this year following a record 
loss of 134 billion in all of 1988 in the absence of profits 
outside investors are difficult to find the result sampls 
anticipated the new capital standards by shedding 28 billion in 
assets in june july and august 
for years were going to be seeing unprecedented massive 
massive restructuring barth said then if something happens 
like a recession things will really get interesting 
the new law makes it easier for commercial banks to merge with 
thrifts or buy their deposits and branches that is causing the 
somewhat perverse result that some institutions are meeting the 
higher capital requirement by selling deposits branches and 
subsidiaries they need to remain profitable over the long haul 
barth said 
sampls by july 1 1991 also will have to devote themselves more 
exclusively to home financing 70 percent of assets up from 60 
percent currently 
thats taking effect as advancing technology is making it easier 
for competitors to enter the mortgage market and on the eve of a 
decade expected to see the housing sector weaken in response to the 
aging of the baby boom generation 
however you varnish it weak aggregate demand for housing 
is going to be part of the picture of the 1990s james w 
christian chief economist of the major sampl trade group wrote 
recently 
he estimated that new households in the 1990s will require 12 
million to 13 million new housing units down from 15 million units 
in the 1980s and 175 million units in the 1970s 
bert ely a financial institutions analyst in alexandria va 
said sampls because of developments in mortgage financing will have 
to compete harder for a piece of the shrinking pie 
the home financing business has been divided into three parts 
because an increasing proportion of mortgages are securitized he 
said large congressionally chartered companies like fannie mae and 
freddie mac buy mortgage loans and then sell securities backed by 
the mortgages 
that means the investor buying the security such as an 
insurance company or pension fund actually supplies the money for 
the mortgage reducing thrifts share of the funding part of the 
business 
that leaves two other areas of business 
mortgage servicing or collecting monthly payments from 
homeowners 
mortgage origination signing up the homeowner in the first 
place 
but since anyone can sell a mortgage to fannie mae and freddie 
mac sampls no longer have a lock on mortgage origination ely said 
and because most thrifts are too small to compete effectively 
against large computerized mortgageservicing operations they are 
losing that part of the business as well he said 
in june for the first time since the government began keeping 
track 19 years ago commercial banks originated more mortgages than 
sampls banks had 38 percent of the market followed by 35 percent 
for sampls and 19 percent for mortgage companies 
all this is causing problems for the us league of savings 
institutions the savings industrys largest trade association its 
membership is down 2758 institutions in august compared to 2990 
at the beginning of the year attendance is down at this years 
convention 3595 versus 5500 in honolulu last year 
the league has cut its staff by 50 positions to 430 its budget 
shrank by 11 percent this year and will shrink another 11 percent 
to 27 million next year 
frederick l webber president of the league says the group 
isnt threatened by the changes if banks buy sampls our programs 
our seminars are there to help them open up new markets he 
said 
meantime the associations immediate goal is to change what it 
considers the most objectionable provisions of the sampl law he said 
even though the league justified asking taxpayers to pay for the 
bailout by portraying sampls as providers of the american dream of 
home ownership it would like to keep the mortgage test at 60 
percent of assets 
the group also would like to reduce the industrys contribution 
to the bailout the 12 regional federal home loan banks which are 
industry owned and provide lowcost loans to member sampls are being 
tapped for 26 billion in retained earnings through 1991 and 
theyre supposed to contribute 300 million a year to help pay the 
interest on government borrowing for the bailout 
were not trying to weasel out of it were trying to remain 
viable webber said we are confident there will be a 
successful thrift industry provided we can correct some of the more 
onerous parts of the sampl bill

when m danny wall took over as the nations 
top savings and loan regulator on july 1 1987 he swiftly ordered 
the heavy glass door leading to his office propped open 
a trim balding man with a neatly trimmed beard and a fondness 
for threepiece suits wall intended his move to be a symbolic 
change from the way his predecessor edwin gray conducted affairs 
at the federal home loan bank board 
but the gesture instead has become a symbol of the turbulence 
wall has encountered during his tenure at what is now the office of 
thrift supervision three times in 16 months the man who walked 
through the door was phoenix ariz millionaire charles h keating 
jr head of a californiabased savings and loan that collapsed at 
an expected cost to the taxpayers of 15 billion to 2 billion 
my method of operation is if somebody wants to talk to me 
im going to listen to them wall said defending his handling of 
lincoln savings and loan association you cant close your 
door to your constituents added the 50yearold regulator who 
came to washington as an aide to gop sen jake garn of utah 
but even leaving the lincoln case aside wall has absorbed his 
share of criticism first for refusing to admit the need for a 
multibillion dollar bailout until after george bush had won the 
1988 presidential election 
second critics fault the sampl rescue deals wall put together in 
a headlong rush at the end of last year committing the government 
to spending some 40 billion congress had not yet appropriated 
but it is his handling of the lincoln case the nations largest 
thrift failure that has generated the fiercest attacks including 
a call to resign from house banking committee chairman henry b 
gonzalez dtexas wall says he wont quit and is expected to 
testify later this month before the house panel 
in three hearings this fall the committee has compiled reams of 
testimony focusing on walls decision to ignore a 1987 
recommendation by his agencys san francisco office to take control 
of lincoln a decision that ultimately delayed the seizure until 
april of this year 
wall in a recent interview said he realizes now that lincoln 
executives were engaged in an intentional effort to hide their 
allegedly fraudulent activities but he said his decision to meet 
with the politically influential keating a heavy contributor to 
the election campaigns of five senators four democrats and one 
republican was proper 
m danny wall the m stands for melvin arrived in washington in 
1975 as the top aide to the newly elected garn his fortunes rose 
with garn and when republicans took control of the senate in 1980 
garn became chairman of the senate banking committee and wall 
became staff director 
in the senate wall acquired a reputation as energetic bright 
accessible and straightforward willing to meet with the financial 
industry interest groups even when he and his boss were pushing 
legislation they opposed 
you could always go out with danny and have a drink with 
danny he did a good job recalled kenneth a guenther 
executive vice president of the independent bankers association of 
america 
after republicans lost control of the senate in 1986 wall began 
to look for a command of his own with grays term ending the 
white house was looking for someone with the political skills 
necessary to deal with congress and the sampl industry in the rough 
period ahead 
wall was confirmed with bipartisan support but it didnt take 
long for the honeymoon to deteriorate he became known for his 
everescalating estimate of the scope of the savings and loan 
debacle and his credibility in congress suffered 
bert ely a financial institutions analyst in alexandria va a 
persistent and ultimately accurate critic of walls assessment 
of the industrys condition said wall is unsuited by temperament 
and professional background for the tough cop role of top 
regulator 
you have to really be a tough person and you have to be 
willing to sit down with a guy eyeballtoeyeball and say im 
going to take your business away from you ely said i dont 
think danny had that in him 
indeed according to barton naylor a former democratic aide on 
the banking committee democratic staffers discovered when wall 
left that the first number on his telephone speed dial was to a 
lobbyist for the us league of savings institutions 
gonzalezs committee plans at least three more hearings on 
lincoln and has scheduled an appearance from wall on nov 21 
despite the steady drumbeat of negative publicity wall has no 
plans to resign and said he will be vindicated by the public when 
he gets a chance to tell his side of the story 
im not saying were lily white in the situation not at 
all wall said but fair play clearly has not been evident 
much less due process 
ely predicted wall will hang on as long as he has garns support 
jake is very loyal to people who have been loyal to him he 
said i dont think the administration is going to lean on danny 
to resign because they dont want to offend the ranking minority 
member on the senate banking committee they need him too much 
garn in a telephone interview said house democrats who bowed 
to lobbyists by refusing to force the sampl industry to pay for its 
own bailout in 1986 are looking for a scapegoat 
in all the years ive been in washington ive never known 
anybody whos been more honest than dan wall its too bad some of 
his detractors dont show equal devotion to the truth he said

like two armies nervously peering at each 
other across a nomans land tobacco state members of congress and 
their antismoking colleagues are not resting easily these days 
with the senate poised to send president bush a bill forbidding 
smoking on virtually all domestic airline flights probably on 
tuesday cigarette opponents say they are ready to move on to 
other restrictions yet in the same breath they warn that the 
wellheeled tobacco lobby cant be counted out yet 
theyve got lots of money and there are members from tobacco 
states with important positions to keep legislation from reaching 
the floor says rep michael andrews dtexas who has introduced 
legislation to boost the federal levy on cigarettes 
tobacco industry supporters insist that approval of the airline 
smoking ban does not translate into retreats on other issues where 
they say they are stronger but they caution that the other side is 
motivated and gradually gaining steam 
the success of the ban was certainly a psychological blow but 
not a significant economic blow because there just arent that 
many cigarettes smoked on airplanes says rep h martin 
lancaster dnc whose district is one of the nations leading 
tobacco growers but support here for the tobacco industry is 
steadily eroding you dont have to be a rocket scientist to figure 
that out 
the nations 36billionayear cigarette industry loses few 
fights on capitol hill congress enacted a ban on smoking on short 
airline flights in 1987 required a series of warning labels on 
cigarette packs in 1984 and in 1982 doubled the excise tax to its 
current 16 cents per pack 
the question now becomes whether the industry whose lobby is 
one of the bestfinanced in the capital stands to lose more 
battles 
the hoppers in the house and senate are overflowing with bills 
aimed at smoking and the industry that profits from it 
some would limit cigarette print advertising to words with no 
models scenery or color permitted radio and television 
advertising is already banned others would boost the excise tax 
in one case using some of the extra money for public service 
announcements on the evils of tobacco 
still other bills would limit the placement of cigarette vending 
machines ban smoking by students in federally supported schools 
halt government efforts to improve tobacco exports and give the 
food and drug administration authority to regulate the substance 
this is the only legal product in america that when used 
according to the manufacturers directions will kill you rep 
richard durbin dill sponsor of the airline smoking ban bills 
says to explain why tobacco products have become such a legislative 
target 
durbin and his allies say their other measures are likely to get 
a boost from the success of the airline smoking legislation a 
public that is gradually purchasing fewer cigarettes is also making 
such efforts more acceptable in congress 
theres a changing political atmosphere on the tobacco 
issue andrews says 
the range of bills is wide but few if any of them appear likely 
to move out of congressional committees in the near future 
tobacco state lawmakers including chairman ernest hollings 
dsc of the senate commerce committee and chairman charles rose 
dnc of the house agriculture tobacco subcommittee have 
strategic positions that let them stifle anticigarette measures 
congressional leaders are also loath to move too strongly 
against tobacco interests knowing they need the votes of lawmakers 
from those states on other issues house democratic whip william h 
gray iii dpa made a crucial speech when housesenate 
negotiators were working on the new airline smoking ban that helped 
preserve smoking on a handful of flights 
another obstacle confronting cigarette foes is the broader range 
of enemies they face in their more ambitious efforts on the 
airline smoking issue ban supporters had just one opponent the 
tobacco industry 
but any effort to raise excise taxes runs into opposition from 
the alcohol fuel telephone and other industries that face similar 
levies advertising restrictions are opposed by publishers 
advertisers and civil libertarians who say the move would violate 
constitutional free speech protections 
i dont see anything coming at us with the speed or intensity 
that airline issue represented says spokesman walker merryman of 
the tobacco institute the cigarette industrys trade group 
yet neither does anyone expect the tobacco opponents to stop 
trying 
youve got enough zealous people in the two houses of congress 
who see great political gain in this says sen terry sanford 
dnc we have to continue to resist this but theres no 
question theyre motivated

broadcasting service 
the overcrowding problem has gotten bad enough that executives 
from some 50 public tv stations that compete in the same cities met 
in dallas in september under the auspices of pbs to talk about 
their grievances 
downey said the meeting the first of its kind was designed to 
cool tensions that have been simmering over new stations in a 
number of cities 
the situation seems to have been getting worse in the last 
four or five years downey said in a recent interview the pot 
just seemed to boil over a bit 
downey said much of the problem stems from the public 
telecommunications facilities program which makes federal matching 
funds available to help build nonprofit communications projects 
such as public tv stations the fund is administered by the 
national telecommunications and information administration a 
commerce department agency 
the fund was designed to encourage broadcasters to build public 
stations in areas previously unserved downey said two to four 
stations per year are being created but mostly in larger 
population centers 
over the years theres been a lot of talk about birth control 
to change ntias policies to discourage establishment of more 
stations particularly in markets already served downey said 
there are about 40 cities in which two or more public tv 
stations compete and although there arent any hard statistics 
available on what kinds of bites these stations are taking out of 
one anothers audiences and donations they all feel the pressure 
public tv executives say 
we end up on the air asking the same people for donations 
said fred esplin general manager of kued a salt lake city utah 
public station that competes with kbyutv in nearby provo a few 
people give to both of us but most people give to one or the 
other 
its something that we think about all the time said joyce 
campbell senior vice president and station manager of weta in 
washington where viewer donations comprise 66 percent of the 
stations budget 
at the dallas meeting station executives discussed pooling 
facilities and staffs pbs officials also urged them to 
differentiate their programming so everyone doesnt show the same 
pbs workhorses such as masterpiece theater and nova 
for example it was pointed out that whmm in washington which 
shares the greater washingtonbaltimore market with weta and 
maryland public television shows many programs aimed at 
washingtons predominantly black audience 
in utah kbyutv which is owned by the morman church has tried 
to distance itself from the mainline pbs programming shown by kued 
we really have a childrens niche and a family niche in this 
market station manager mel rogers said lassie and 
flipper might be found on kbyu and rogers said the stations 
lawrence welk show is the most popular public tv program in utah 
kued aims more for the yuppie market 
kybu and kued have agreed to hold regular summit meetings to 
discuss differences and sometimes divvy up programs 
one sore point that competing public stations havent resolved 
is program costs stations buy programs from pbs based upon their 
ability to pay which means newer stations usually pay less for the 
same programs than their more entrenched competitors 
don johnson president of krmatv in denver estimated that his 
station pays three to four times as much per program for the 
same programs as denvers smaller public station kbditv there is 
nearly 50 percent duplication of programming between the two 
stations johnson said 
he said pbs was working on a new payment formula for programs 
as for local fundraising the presence of two stations makes 
it very difficult to go out into the business community to attempt 
to get underwriting johnson said 
corporation for public broadcasting figures show that viewer 
donations to public tv stations nationwide grew from about 75 
million in 1980 to more than 220 million in 1987 not counting 
inflation 
the number of subscribers grew from about 23 million to 45 
million in the same period 
total public tv income grew from a little under 600 million in 
1980 to over 1 billion in 1987 unadjusted for inflation

a 305 billion defense bill that takes a chunk 
out of president bushs request for star wars but leaves other big 
programs mostly intact comes under congressional scrutiny this week 
amid some grousing over the compromise package 
a handful of republicans and democrats have expressed opposition 
to the military blueprint for fiscal 1990 some complain that the 
legislation is a jobs bill while others say two types of 
landbased nuclear missile is too many 
on nuclear weapons we produced a strategic mush that decides 
absolutely nothing rep charles bennett dfla a member of the 
house armed services committee said friday we need a strategic 
diet that cancels some nuclear weapons to end duplication 
all the same indications are that the defense bill for the 
fiscal year that began oct 1 will win approval in the house and 
senate and receive the presidents signature the house may take 
up the legislation this week 
also this week democrats and republicans will continue their 
efforts to nail down an agreement that would allow congressional 
passage of a debtlimit extension and a deficitreduction bill 
the government has reached its borrowing limit of 28 trillion 
and default will occur unless the ceiling is extended early in the 
week 
agreement also could allow congress to try to roll back the 
161 billion in cuts in most federal programs imposed under the 
grammrudman deficitreduction law on oct 1 
sen john warner of virginia ranking republican on the senate 
armed services committee said thursday that the defense bill 
reflects support for the president particularly in those areas 
where he felt it essential at the bargaining table in the arms 
control arena 
the bill adopted by house and senate conferees after nearly two 
months of wrangling slashes 11 billion from bushs request of 
49 billion for the strategic defense initiative commonly known 
as star wars 
the cut represents a 7 percent drop from the amount spent on the 
program in fiscal 1989 and marks the first year that sdi has 
suffered a decrease in spending 
on the other strategic programs the mx nuclear missile the 
midgetman missile and the b2 stealth bomber the administration 
experienced limited cuts the defense bill trimmed 150 million 
from the approximately 12 billion bush sought for the two 
landbased missiles and provided money for two b2 bombers one 
less than the administration sought in fiscal 1990 
the most contentious issues were bushs proposal to cancel 10 
programs including the navys f14d tomcat jet fighter and the 
marine corps v22 osprey 
the congressional negotiators decided to continue two programs 
the f14d and the ahip helicopter for one more year before 
killing the program and postponed a decision on the v22 osprey 
and the phoenix missile the conferees accepted the 
administrations plan to kill six other programs including the 
ssn688 submarine the f15 aircraft and the m88 tank recovery 
vehicle 
conservative organizations including the center for peace and 
freedom have called on bush to veto the bill because of the cut in 
star wars spending defense secretary dick cheney said he would 
have preferred a higher level of funding for sdi 
but lawmakers have contended all along that support for the 
program is diminishing and defense analysts said the 
administration was clearly concerned about other issues 
its significant that the administration did better on b2 mx 
and midgetman than it did on sdi john isaacs head of the 
liberal group council for a livable world said friday the 
priority for this administration is other issues not sdi 
among the other provisions of the defense bill is the barring of 
any money for the f16 aircraft one of the air forces top 
programs until it shapes up and takes close air support 
seriously said the house armed services committee in its report 
on the legislation the administration had sought 34 billion for 
the program 
the bill trims about 500 million from the troubled trident ii 
missile provides only about 900 million of the 11 billion the 
administration requested for the advanced tactical fighter and adds 
848 million for the national guard and reserves 
the bill also eliminates 14500 positions in europe associated 
with the intermediaterange nuclear missiles banned under the 
ussoviet treaty signed in december 1987 and includes 
senatepassed burden sharing provisions 
were saying to our nato allies the percentage of us forces 
in europe is not going to increase if you reduce your forces ours 
are going to be reduced too unless some other country makes up for 
it sen sam nunn dga chairman of the senate armed services 
committee said thursday 
the bill also eliminates a senateapproved provision that would 
have given federal agents the authority to shoot down a plane 
suspected of transporting illegal narcotics into the united states

casino gambling supporters fresh from a 
victory in a citywide referendum plan to emphasize economic 
development and local control when they ask a skeptical gov evan 
bayh and the indiana general assembly to approve gambling 
legislation 
voters in this economically depressed steel town endorsed casino 
gambling by a 60 percent to 40 percent margin on saturday setting 
the stage for a legislative battle in the 1990 general assembly 
over the proposal to allow casinohotels to be built on the lake 
michigan shore 
an opportunity for jobs and economic revitalization thats 
going to be the pitch said rep earline s rogers a democrat 
from gary in the absence of the state coming up with a way to 
solve our problems weve come up with something ourselves 
bayh said he believed the referendum result is important but not 
compelling given a voter turnout of just 323 percent 
im opposed to casino gambling but im willing to sit down 
and look at all the arguments for and against and i have yet to do 
that said bayh you never say never 
when youre in public office you have to hear people out and 
see if they have a compelling argument that hasnt been 
considered the governor said 
mayor thomas v barnes and other gary casino advocates 
including representatives of the gambling industry believe the 
city could support five lakefront casinohotels which would 
produce 25000 casinorelated jobs and an additional 10000 jobs 
for construction workers 
those figures coupled with the support shown in the nonbinding 
referendum make a strong case casino advocates believe 
the decline of the steel industry in the early 80s caused the 
loss of thousands of jobs once the states secondlargest city 
gary dropped to fourth as its population declined from 190000 to 
135000 
the more we tell our story the more people look at the 
numbers the more inclined they are to look at the opportunity 
favorably said robert spolyar a lobbyist for resorts 
international a casino operator 
rogers said she also plans to appeal to the traditional hoosier 
belief in selfhelp and selfdetermination 
this is a state that believes in local determination that 
believes in home rule and were going to make the legislators 
prove that thats what they believe in she said 
but the casino advocates know the battle wont be easy like 
bayh several legislative leaders say theyre not convinced casino 
gambling is best for gary and for the state 
asked what she would say to the governor who carried the 
heavily democratic gary area by wide margins last year rogers 
said one word count count the supporters of this issue count 
the jobs count the revenue 
im certain wen he balances that with his personal 
reservations that will outweigh his personal beliefs she said 
other legislators predicted the governors position will 
determine what the legislature does 
i dont think youre going to see a lot of people both in his 
party and in the republican party feel theres any necessity to 
send a bill down there thats going to be vetoed said house 
republican speaker paul s mannweiler of indianapolis the house 
evenly divided between republicans and democrats has a speaker 
from each party 
that decision could involve questions about the morality of 
gambling more than arguments over jobs and local control said 
mannweiler because of the morality issue he argued the casino 
issue is different from past economic development appeals made by 
legislators other parts of the state 
even though gary says this is a localoption issue that we 
ought to help gary help themselves casino gambling is not somthing 
i look very favorably on seeing in the state of indiana anywhere 
said mannweiler 
if we in indianapolis would have asked for legalized 
prostitution i would certainly see why somebody someplace else in 
the state would want to vote against it he said 
but other lawmakers contend garys problems are so urgent that 
some people who would normally oppose casinos might be persuaded 
to give it a try said senate assistant minority leader louis j 
mahern a democrat from indianapolis 
i believe that anybody in the legislature who rejects the idea 
because of the moral issue of gambling almost has a burden on them 
to come up with their solution to garys problems said mahern

the savings and loan industrys largest trade 
group sunday announced the formation of a foundation designed to 
get thrift institutions more involved in housing loans to people of 
modest means 
the housing opportunities foundation established with 500000 
as an affiliate of the us league of savings institutions will 
provide howto information to savings institutions and track 
trends and issues related to home ownership 
but its main focus will be advising the 12 regional federal home 
loan banks on how to administer a new affordable housing program 
established by sampl legislation enacted in august 
the regional banks created by congress but owned by sampls are 
required to provide 50 million a year from 1990 through 1993 75 
million in 1994 and 100 million a year thereafter 
robert b obrien jr a new jersey savings and loan executive 
who will be chairman of the foundation says he believes the money 
should be used to provide discounted mortgages for people who would 
not otherwise be able to own their homes

oilproducing gulf countries are linking 
up with refineries and retailers around the world in an effort to 
ensure secure outlets for their crude said a study released sunday 
the trend could make the 13nation organization of petroleum 
exporting countries less relevant at least in its ability to fix 
crude oil prices said the study conducted by gulf international 
bank 
the study contended that integrated producers will focus more on 
the prices of refined products rather than crude 
as the countries with large excess capacity make more inroads 
into global integration they will find their interests 
diverging from the rest of opec and more in common with the major 
oil companies said the study by the bahrainbased bank 
for example last year saudi arabia signed a 50 percent 
partnership deal with us oil giant texaco inc that covers three 
refineries and 11450 retail stations in 23 states the venture 
guarantees an outlet for an estimated 615000 barrels per day of 
saudi crude the study said 
kuwait a pioneer in spreading out to downstream ventures is 
guaranteed some 250000 barrels per day through refineries and 
retail stations it purchased outright in the united states and 
northern europe 
the study also said that abu dhabi has embarked on a similar 
path with its acquisition of a 10 percent stake in spains largest 
private oil refiner cia espanola de petroleos cepsa and a 10 
percent stake in the french company total 
kuwait saudi arabia and the united arab emirates are members of 
the 6nation gulf cooperation council along with bahrain qatar 
and oman the study predicted the latter three would follow a 
different pattern by linking up with local oil producers 
the study cited reports that these countries were pushing for 
more involvement either through joint ventures or direct 
purchases in america europe and asia 
gulf oil and refining strategies will be discussed at a gcc oil 
ministers meeting scheduled for nov 19 in abu dhabi the following 
day the ministers will be joined by the rest of the members of the 
11nation organization of arab petroleum exporting countries which 
has long sought to integrate arab oil operations
