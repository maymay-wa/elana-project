a jail inmate who made his second escape in 
two months by pulling a gun carved from soap was captured sunday in 
a pecan grove 
roy kenneth sanford 23 was caught while walking in the grove 
south of perry said houston county sheriff cullen talton he 
escaped saturday after he pulled what looked like a semiautomatic 
weapon on three guards and ordered another inmate to open a 
cellblock door 
the gun had been carved from two bars of soap and painted black 
talton said 
at first glance it looked like the real thing talton said 
of course when you looked close you could tell it wasnt he 
even used an eye from a shoe like you run shoelaces through to 
make the barrel look real 
sanford serving time for armed robbery and kidnapping was one 
of seven inmates who escaped from the county jail two months ago 
he was making a phone call saturday when he asked jailer clarence 
cash if he could get a drink of water from a cooler outside the 
security door talton said 
cash let sanford through talton said sanford went to the water 
cooler then pulled what appeared to be a gun forced jailers to 
lie on the floor and made his escape talton said 
its a situation that never should have happened talton 
said sunday its a case of jailers being negligent and not 
following the rules of the jail 
talton said authorities would consider disciplinary action 
against cash monday

janie hayes wears a mask and goggles at work 
otherwise her job would drive her to tears 
the lab technician at the university of georgias coastal plain 
experiment station peels and grinds samples of vidalia onions and 
then conducts chemical tests that may someday enable consumers to 
identify the strength of an onion 
the gourmet onions have a reputation of being the sweetest 
mildest in the world but when there are 50 to 60 vidalias to slice 
in a day her lab fills with eyeburning fumes and a pungent odor 
i have to wear a mask and goggles mrs hayes said 
otherwise my eyes burn and my sinuses throb 
she and horticulturist doyle smittle are collecting information 
on sugar and pungency levels in vidalias 
were trying to develop a rapid objective method of measuring 
quality in onions said smittle wed like to have a technique 
simple enough that a grower or group of growers could measure 
the quality in at least every field of onions they have 
this summer food scientist robert shewfelt will convene a taste 
panel at the experiment station in griffin to sample some of the 
same onions that have been tested 
smittle who has been studying the compounds in onions since the 
mid1970s hopes to establish a relationship between the chemical 
composition of vidalias and the onions preferred by the taste panel 
onions have virtually no odor until their tissue is damaged by 
slicing at that point an enzyme triggers a chemical reaction that 
produces ammonia and other substances that cause tears 
chemical tests give a good indication of an onions pungency 
but theyre too complicated and costly for routine use by growers 
said smittle 
taste buds arent as reliable as laboratory tests because humans 
tend to forget how bad or good a sample was he said members of 
the taste panel will sample six onions a day then theyll come 
back a week or two later and evaluate the same onions 
the horticulturist foresees use of an infrared device that would 
scan onions in the packing sheds and determine their mildness 
since sugars absorb infrared light there may be a correlation 
between taste and the amount of light that passes through onions 
he said 
smittle believes growers eventually will be able to place 
stickers on each onion with a picture of a thermometer showing the 
degree of mildness his tests have shown that onion mildness varies 
from field to field and season to season 
with a pungency rating consumers could use the hotter onions in 
dishes that require more flavor the rating also would help 
consumers adjust the thickness of slices to specific needs 
georgias 260 registered growers and packers have turned the 
vidalia onion into a 30millionayear crop protected by state 
law onions bearing the vidalia label have to be a yellow granex 
hybrid the growing region encompasses 13 counties in southeastern 
georgia and parts of six other 
growers claim vidalias are sweetest because of the variety and 
the lowsulfur soil around vidalia a town of 10000 residents 
about 80 miles west of savannah

norbert rillieux and jan matzeliger helped 
revolutionize american history with their inventions but the two 
men scarcely rate a footnote in the annals of yankee ingenuity 
simply because they were black 
historian portia james is setting matters straight with an 
ambitious new smithsonian institution exhibition that celebrates 
the genius of americas unsung black inventors 
the show which opens sunday pays belated tribute to 40 
inventors whose creations include a trouserstretching device for 
eliminating wrinkles a machine for producing paper bags a press 
for baling cotton and a mechanical traffic signal patented in 1923 
the exhibition says a lot about their urge to create and how 
important it was for blacks to feel they were part of the growth of 
american technology said ms james the shows curator it was 
their assertion of black participation in the yankee innovative 
spirit 
the exhibition at the smithsonians anacostia museum of 
afroamerican history and culture is titled the real mccoy 
african american invention and innovation 16191930 
the shows name is taken from an invention by mechanical 
engineer elijah mccoy a grease cup designed for lubricating rail 
locomotives while they sped down the tracks admiring train 
engineers nicknamed it the real mccoy 
on display are the two devices created by black inventors which 
probably have had the greatest lasting impact on american society 
said ms james a native of detroit who is the anacostia museums 
resident historian 
one of them developed by the new orleans inventor rillieux in 
1830 is a vacuum evaporation machine that made refined sugar 
widely affordable it later was used to produce such foods as 
evaporated milk and cocoa powder 
the other is matzeligers shoelasting machine patented in 1883 
by the inventor from dutch surinam the machine radically changed 
the american shoe industry by eliminating the need for costly 
handstitching of soles to the soft leather uppers of shoes 
the museum duly recognizes one of the few prominent black 
inventors george washington carver with a sampling of the 
products he derived from peanuts soybeans and sweet potatoes in 
his laboratory at alabamas tuskegee institute 
but it also highlights such unknowns as lewis latimer of queens 
ny the only black associate on thomas edisons laboratory team 
who patented a carbon light bulb filament another is garrett 
morgan of cleveland who invented both the stopgo traffic signal 
and an industrial safety hood or gas mask which he used to 
rescue workers trapped by a tunnel explosion under lake erie 
ms james notes that african slaves introduced the banjo to 
american music and that boston clergyman cotton mather learned of 
inoculation against smallpox from his north african slave onesimus 
the exhibition honors new york tailor thomas jennings the first 
black believed to have received a patent for his dry cleaning 
process in 1821 on display are three wood planes designed in the 
1770s by cesar chelor a freed slave from wrentham mass who is 
believed to be the earliest black toolmaker in america 
ms james said her research for the exhibition took three years 
because of the scarcity of historical records 
material came from old newspapers and magazines published for 
the black community and from an exhaustive record of pre1900 
patents awarded to black inventors that was compiled by henry 
baker an early black us patent examiner she said 
ms james research yielded the tale of oscar je stuart a 
mississippi planter who tried to obtain a patent in 1857 for a 
laborsaving double cotton scraper invented by his slave ned 
stuart argued that the master is the owner of the fruits of 
the labor of the slave both intellectual and manual but the 
federal government granted neither man a patent 
undaunted stuart began manufacturing neds creation and issued 
advertising circulars containing this testimonial from a fellow 
plantation owner 
i am glad to know that your implement is the invention of a 
negro slave thus giving the lie to the abolition cry that slavery 
dwarfs the mind of the negro when did a free negro ever invent 
anything 
as for the ingenious slave ms james says ned disappeared 
from history and nothing is known of what became of him

a top house democrat says an arrangement that 
earned him 6882 in four months through buying junk bonds with 
other peoples money wasnt worth the trouble in light of the 
current focus on ethics 
with the benefit of hindsight i now regret having made this 
transaction rep tony coelho dcalif said sunday as he 
released his lawyers report on the bond purchase 
as house majority whip coelho is the thirdranking democrat and 
chief votecounter for house speaker jim wright dtexas who has 
been charged by the house ethics committee with violating rules in 
his personal financial dealings 
coelho who could move up in the house leadership if wright 
falls said sunday he would be amending his 1986 financial 
disclosure to include a previously unreported 50000 loan that 
financed half of a 100000 investment in junk bonds in 1986 
his lawyers report said the chief executive of the savings and 
loan that provided that financing had suggested the junk bond 
investment to coelho and then purchased the bonds on coelhos 
behalf when the congressman needed more time to raise the money 
junk bonds are highrisk highyield bonds often used to finance 
corporate takeovers 
according to his lawyers report coelho first considered 
investing his 1986 campaign funds in the 12 12 percent bonds 
based on a suggestion by thomas spiegel chief executive officer of 
the columbia savings and loan association of beverly hills calif 
after coelho decided against that investment for his campaign 
treasury spiegel suggested that coelho himself could make an 
investment in the bonds which were being issued for a takeover of 
beatrice foods arranged by drexel burnham lambert 
when coelho could not come up with the 100000 by the required 
purchase date of may 5 spiegel bought the bonds himself and held 
them for a month while coelho completed his financing half the 
money came from spiegels thrift institution and the rest from two 
other banks 
at that point coelho bought the bonds from spiegel and paid him 
interest equivalent to what the bonds made during the period of the 
loan when the congressman sold the bonds in october 1986 he was 
able to repay the loans and realize a 6882 profit 
in his report attorney robert f bauer concluded that coehlo 
did not violate house rules in his arrangement with spiegel 
because the congressman paid interest and thus accepted no gift 
which might have been improper 
the fact that the investment was issued at first to coelhos 
campaign committee instead of the congressman was a clerical 
error bauer said errors in the reported dates of the transactions 
might require coelho to amend his 1986 tax returns he said 
we believe that the appearances presented by the transaction 
can be properly addressed by a full disclosure of all surrounding 
circumstances he said 
there is no indication whether the ethics committee is 
considering or plans to review the bond purchase 
coelho insists spiegel has asked for no legislative favors and 
none were granted coelho said in his statement he was accepting 
without reservations the conclusion of my legal counsel that the 
purchase of the bonds was totally above board 
but he said public officials are today however living in a 
period of intense questioning 
with the benefit of hindsight i now regret having made this 
transaction he said i dont like it when my public decisions 
or private actions raise questions as this investment did and the 
6882 profit wasnt worth the trouble 
coelho last year put all of his holdings into a blind trust 
coelho did not disclose the bond transaction with spiegel or the 
loan from spiegels financial institution when the washington post 
last month first reported on his junk bond investment 
david dreyer coelhos press secretary said the congressmans 
staff had taken a month to understand fully and reconstruct this 
transaction 
he said that effort did not include checking whether spiegel had 
any interest in legislation since that indicates a violation of 
house rules only if spiegel had conferred a gift

members of the house and senate must soon 
disclose how much outside income they earned from speeches and 
other activities that have fueled debate over a congressional pay 
raise and created a preoccupation with ethics 
on friday senators and on may 22 members of the house of 
representatives will make public their financial disclosure forms 
which all highlevel people in the government must file 
although the forms reveal such matters as what stocks the 
members of congress bought sold and own and how much they got in 
reimbursements when they went on the road to make a speech 
attention this year as never before is apt to focus on the fees 
paid members of congress for giving speeches 
common cause the public interest membership group which has 
campaigned for tougher ethical standards says it has counted 245 
newspaper editorials demanding an end to these honoraria calling 
the fees legalized bribery legislative prostitution and 
lobbyists payola 
under congress own rules members are permitted to take 2000 
for giving speeches writing articles or sometimes merely putting 
in an appearance the fees are often paid by groups or companies 
with a vital interest in legislation before the speakers 
committees 
last may members of congress reported getting 98 million in 
honoraria fees in 1987 a 30 percent increase over 1986 
because house rules restrict outside earned income to 30 percent 
of salary and senate rules restrict senators from taking honoraria 
fees worth more than 40 percent of salary many members get more 
than they can keep and give the overflow to charity 
last year members of congress kept 75 million and gave away 
23 million 
the average senator kept 23200 and the average house member 
kept 12200 
the defense industry alone paid more than 500000 in speaking 
fees to members of congressional committees that deal with defense 
issues 
president bush in endorsing a 51 percent pay boost in january 
that had been recommended by a commission appointed by former 
president ronald reagan also endorsed a simultaneous ban on 
honoraria 
when a public outcry caused congress to vote down the pay raise 
it also rejected the honoraria ban but the issue didnt go away 
a commission appointed by bush to recommend tighter ethics rules 
for government proposed a ban on all honoraria and more stringent 
limits on how much outside income can be earned by someone in 
government 
more recently house speaker jim wright was charged with ethics 
violations stemming in part from his earnings on a book the house 
ethics committee charged he used bulk sales of the book 
reflections of a public man to circumvent restrictions on 
outside income 
former attorney general griffin bell a member of the 
commission said honoraria fees present the appearance of a 
conflict of interest 
people wonder whos paying all these honoraria he said 
it undermines confidence in government 
the financial disclosure requirement grew out of the 
watergatespawned demand for higher ethical standards in 
government congress adopted an ethics code in 1977 and put it into 
law in 1978 
bush adopted most but not all of his commissions 
recommendations he called for banning honoraria for judges but not 
for members of congress 
he said he would deal with an honoraria ban when he again 
approaches the delicate issue of proposing a pay raise for congress 
rep barney frank dmass chairman of the house judiciary 
subcommittee that will consider bushs ethics recommendations said 
he favors a ban on congressional honoraria fees although he would 
allow members to continue earning some outside income for such 
activities as teaching a course in law school 
frank refuses honoraria as do a number of freshman congressmen 
congress is also required to disclose reimbursement for the 
actual and necessary travel expenses incurred when engaged in 
speechmaking 
but common cause says many in congress have used creative 
interpretations of these rules 
the organization cited a report by sen james exon dneb that 
he and his wife accepted round trip airfare to hawaii and eight 
nights food and lodging paid for by the american association of 
airport executives as necessary travel expenses or the report by 
rep herb callahan rala that he got 3948 in travel and 
lodging reimbursement for three days at las vegas nev paid by 
the national moving and storage association

the bush administration cant afford to be 
complacent about warming relations between the soviet union and 
china but neither must it fear the shift is taking place at 
washingtons expense say analysts of sinosoviet ties 
soviet leader mikhail gorbachevs fourday pilgrimage to 
beijing which begins today is unlikely to result in a renewal of 
the 1950s military alliance of communist giants says seweryn 
bialer a soviet specialist and professor of international 
relations at columbia university 
i dont think its a military alliance but it is a 
summit of major significance because both countries need each 
other again bialer said at a recent luncheon hosted in 
washington by the eastwest forum 
bialer predicted that economic cooperation between china and the 
soviet union will grow extensively now that the 30year rift 
between moscow and beijing has been healed 
economic cooperation is in the interest of both countries 
he said 
and he noted chinese officials have taken pains to let the 
united states know that renewed sinosoviet links will not come at 
the expense of the expanding uschina relationship 
an invitation to us warships to visit shanghai delayed until 
a day after gorbachev tours the port city is designed as 
reassurance for america because the chinese are very worried 
that this summit would be received very badly in the united 
states the professor said 
andrew brick an analyst at the conservative heritage 
foundation argues that a military pact doesnt appear to be in the 
offing because neither gorbachev nor deng xiaoping wants to risk 
access to vital western financial and technological assistance 
he points out that americans can hardly criticize the chinese 
for following the pattern of warming ussoviet relations also 
he argues the summit comes at a time when us and chinese ties 
have deepened on so many fronts industrial trade military 
cooperation shared technology and vast cultural and educational 
exchanges there is almost no possibility that a rapprochement 
with the soviets would come at the price of cooler relations with 
the us 
but the administration must be wary of any renewed military 
cooperation and let both nations know that such a development could 
cause the president to reassess his support for the normalization 
of relations brick said 
if the soviets and chinese iron out their socalled three 
obstacles to improved ties tensions along their 4670mile 
border as well as soviet involvement in afghanistan and vietnam a 
more stable asia could result brick said a development that would 
benefit the united states 
rand corp analyst jonathan pollack in an essay on the summit 
written for the asia society points out that the summit occurs 
at a time when the sinoamerican relationship is on a vastly more 
diversified footing than when soviet initiatives toward beijing 
first began 
pollack points to the growth in uschina trade which in 1988 
surpassed 13 billion or more than four times the level of 
sinosoviet trade us investment in china has topped 3 billion 
more than any other single country and more than 30000 chinese 
students are in the united states as technological and military 
exchanges are growing 
american interests would not be well served by an attempt to 
curry favor with either state in the aftermath of the summit the 
basis for good relations with both moscow and beijing can and does 
exist independent of their relations with each other says the 
think tanks specialist on chinesesoviet ties 
most analysts agree the summit may mark the symbolic end of the 
strategic triangular relationship that gave birth to the notion of 
the united states playing the socalled china card or the idea 
that the antagonistic relationship between moscow and beijing 
offered the united states leverage in dealing with either nation 
there is no more triangle it is a quadrangle said bialer 
who points to the entrance of japan as the major economic power in 
asia 
the shift does present a new and more complex challenge pollack 
says especially since there no longer seem any illusions about 
the ability of the united states to manipulate sinosoviet 
differences to the advantage of american interests

one million metric tons of wheat would fill 
11100 covered hopper cars used by railroads to move grain 
if towed by a single locomotive the train would be about 116 
miles long according to figures supplied by the association of 
american railroads 
the agriculture department says the soviet union has already 
bought enough wheat and corn this fiscal year to fill about 20 of 
the millionton trains 
if those were lined up one behind the other they would stretch 
2320 miles roughly the distance from washington dc to twin 
falls idaho 
specifically moscow has bought a record 193 million tons of 
us wheat and corn for delivery through sept 30 and has been 
cleared to purchase a maximum of 24 million tons by then 
and the soviet union is only part of the huge annual export flow 
of us farm commodities that move by railroad truck and river 
barge to seaports and then to overseas points 
japan is the biggest single foreign customer of american 
farmers and china this year at least is the largest buyer of 
us wheat 
but moscows grain needs coupled with historic secrecy in the 
early dealings with soviet buyers are paramount in the way usda 
and farmers look at the export situation 
crop failure in the ukraine or even the hint of significant 
losses can send tremors through the us and world commodity 
markets its something thats watched closely by farmers private 
traders and usda analysts 
by law private exporters must report all big sales 100000 
tons or more to usda within 24 hours all sales regardless of 
size are reported weekly 
jean nollmeyer of the departments foreign agricultural service 
has updated her records showing the high marks for oneday grain 
sales no specific countrys are listed however 
the public announcements of large grain sales go back to early 
1977 although weekly disclosures go back several more years 
when very large grain sales are announced there are sometimes 
inquiries about their relative size and whether a record has been 
reached nollmeyers list helps answer those questions 
the biggest days activity on nollmeyers list was on july 6 
1979 when exporters reported sales totaling nearly 248 million 
tons of grain including 186 million tons of corn and 616200 tons 
of wheat but because of a provision in the law the exporters 
reported the grains foreign destination as unknown 
often however the grain in the initial unknown category is 
changed in later reports to the soviet union china or some other 
buyer 
unofficially since nollmeyers oneday records go back only to 
april 14 1977 there were a few sales larger than the one she 
cites this requires a bit of history 
the export reporting system was ordered by congress in the early 
1970s following huge secret dealings between moscow and private 
grain companies the soviet union in 1972 for example secretly 
bought about a fourth of that years us wheat crop plus corn 
barley and soybeans 
in all more than 16 million tons of those commodities were 
contracted in a few weeks of dealing in the summer of 1972 about 
threefourths of the grain was wheat 
the huge anticipated soviet purchases of us wheat and corn 
that year produced a sizable runup in us food prices and depleted 
us reserve stocks the usda says in a background report 
and there were charges that some usda insiders had played along 
with the soviets that fat export subsidies were involved and that 
there was even a commodity spy at work 
congress stepped into the fray in 1973 ordering an export sales 
reporting system to help bring order and accountability to the 
business 
but there was still turmoil and moscow periodically faced with 
huge food deficits continued to be an erratic customer of the 
american farmer 
in 1975 after another round of large sales further shipments 
were embargoed by president ford in july and finally lifted the 
following october after a longterm agreement was worked out with 
the soviets to buy annual amounts of us wheat and corn 
the pact took effect on oct 1 1976 and has been renewed or 
extended since then 
even so sales to the soviet union sometimes were huge on april 
28 1976 for example usda announced sales of corn totaling 14 
million tons later the same day officials announced a further 
sale of 17 million tons of corn plus 300000 tons of wheat 
in all the oneday flurry involved the sale of 34 million tons 
of grain to the soviet union 
nowadays with exporters and the kremlin accustomed to the 
longterm agreements terms and the reporting requirements a sale 
of a million tons or so in one day is considered unusual 
in fact according to nollmeyers list oneday total grain 
sales to all foreign buyers including the soviet union have 
exceeded 2 million tons only three times since 1977

leaders of corporate america say 
business is surprisingly good and theyre prepared to weather the 
sharp downturn that looms ahead 
members of the business council made up of chief executives 
from 65 major corporations gathered at the posh homestead resort 
this past weekend for their semiannual country retreat 
the business councils economists are projecting that economic 
growth as measured by the gross national product will fall from 
last years strong 39 percent pace to 14 percent by the end of 
the year and rebound late in 1990 
but many executives were generally more bullish than their own 
analysts 
we really see that as good news not bad news said david t 
kearns chairman of xerox corp when you get a slowing of growth 
it should keep inflation down 
signs of an economic slowdown have proliferated in recent 
months in weak retail sales flat industrial production plunging 
home sales and construction and slower overall spending by 
consumers 
still even among leaders of industries most affected by the 
slowdown there were few furrowed brows over the weekend or 
admissions that trouble lies ahead 
philip hawley chairman of carter hawley hale stores said 
general merchandisers are seeing somewhat better sales than 
anticipated 
hawley did acknowledge the onset of a slowdown in spending on 
bigticket durable goods such as major appliances but he said 
companies are doing a good job of keeping their inventories under 
control 
a similarly bright outlook for the auto industry which has 
experienced sluggish sales so far this year came from roger smith 
chairman of general motors corp and of the business council 
any time that our industry is looking at car and truck sales 
up in the 15 million area why its got to be a good year for us 
smith said 
he conceded that sales are being propped up by big rebates and 
cutrate financing but said surveys showing that consumer 
confidence remains high bode well for future sales 
john f welch chairman of general electric co said business 
leaders are making few plans to retrench because the slowing 
economy still offers the prospect of reasonable growth 
we dont see at least in front of us today any precipitous 
drop welch said capital spending will remain about where it 
is and productivity will continue to improve 
said walter v shipley chairman of chemical banking corp my 
view is that theres a little stronger undercurrent to the economy 
than this forecast and i think there will be higher inflationary 
pressures 
shipley said he believes gains in american productivity have 
been underestimated and favorable exchange rates are making us 
products more competitive overseas 
sd bechtel chairman of the giant engineering and construction 
company that bears his name had a similarly positive outlook for 
the economy overall although he said the construction business 
remains weak 
weve been down for several years and the economy got its 
strength without us he said 
several chief executives said a possible jinx to the bright 
outlook lies in the risk of interest rates rising further 
that changes currency rates and starts a whole set of things 
going that are difficult to plan for kearns said 
the federal reserve board for a year has been pushing up 
interest rates in an effort to rein in inflation by restraining 
economic growth 
a growing number of analysts are expressing concern that the fed 
could push interest rates so high and slow growth so much that it 
unintentionally pushes the country into a recession 
the biggest thing that we would fear would be hype on the 
economy that would lead to fed quicktrigger action welch said

arrives monday for the first sinosoviet summit in 30 years the 
official beijing daily announced the central square will be cleared 
of all pedestrians and traffic on monday

the people adjoining the square that the government is seriously 
considering ways to promote democracy and end official corruption 
both are student demands 
about 3500 students from more than a dozen universities all 
wearing white headbands to signify participation in the fast 
converged on the square saturday afternoon and evening however by

pedestrians from 830 am to 830 pm monday 730 pm edt

zhao told the workers saturday that democratic changes and 
corruption will be discussed next month when the standing committee 
of chinas legislature meets 
every patriotic chinese citizen should safeguard the dignity 
of the motherland and its international image the official 
xinhua news agency paraphrased zhao as saying nobody should do 
anything to impede or jeopardize the summit 
zhaos remarks followed a meeting of the ruling politburo last 
week that endorsed his moderate line toward student demands 
according to sunday editions of the new york times 
the newspaper quoting three unidentified chinese familiar with 
the proceedings said the result of the meeting held wednesday and 
thursday was to bolster zhaos faction and its calls for economic 
and political reform 
leading activist wang dan of beijing university said fasting 
students may still be in the square when the soviet leader arrives 
monday for the first chinesesoviet summit in 30 years as for 
whether we will disrupt mr gorbachevs visit to china that 
depends on the government he said 
we will persist to the end said fasting graduate students 
from qinghua university this is a last resort 
early sunday hundreds of students and workers began flocking to 
the square with banners and posters to express support for the fast 
beijing mayor chen xitong arrived at the square shortly before 3 
am sunday but was shouted down when he tried to address the 
crowd chen was accompanied by state education committee minister 
li tieying and they left 15 minutes later 
about 30 students met earlier with yan mingfu head of the 
communist partys united front work department he was the 
highestranking party official to confer with the demonstrators 
two student leaders reported that he told them that some party 
members want to use the turmoil as a reason to stop reforms 
the hunger strikers wearing white headbands and sashes sat 
inside a protective cordon of several thousand nonfasting students 
in the vast square that is the symbolic center of power in china 
as temperatures dropped after sunset saturday to below 50 
degrees many pulled on jackets or covered themselves with 
blankets while others wrapped themselves in their red and white 
banners 
shortly before midnight four trucks and two buses of police 
pulled up to the square and security forces stood watching they 
did not intervene 
the fast began saturday evening after the students marched 
several hours from their campuses to the square it is the latest 
in a monthold student campaign for a free press human rights an 
end to official corruption and other reforms 
after repeated student marches sitins and a class boycott the 
government made a major concession friday by offering to meet 
monday with an independent student group 
however students said they were still discussing with officials 
the terms of a possible dialogue they were dissatisfied with 
government conditions that include a limit on the number of student 
delegates and insistence that students from statesponsored 
organizations also attend students also said they wanted the talks 
to be broadcast live 
if talks are held the students want the government to guarantee 
not to punish students who have protested to observe 
constitutional guarantees of free speech and to reinstate a 
liberal newspaper editor fired for resisting censorship

in shanghai so the event does not coincide with gorbachevs planned 
visit to the port city the foreign ministry said saturday the 
ships will make the port call may 19 the day after gorbachevs 
visit 
the announcement appeared to defuse a major source of diplomatic 
friction between the soviets and the chinese

san berndardino calif the braking systems were faulty on two 
locomotives of a freight train that thundered down the steep cajon 
pass smashed into 11 homes and killed four people investigators 
said saturday 
national transportation safety board acting chairman james 
kolstad told reporters saturday night that the socalled dynamic 
brakes failed to work but it was too early to tell if that caused 
the wreck he said 
locomotives have air brakes which apply pressure to the wheels 
dynamic brakes reverse the direction of the wheels he explained 
it appears a great majority of the cars were braking at the 
time of the accident he said 
the search of the wreckage ended saturday afternoon and heavy 
equipment began removing the twisted train cars that flew off 
curved tracks into the homes friday 
the body of a crewman was found at 230 am hours after a man 
was pulled alive from his crumbled home no one else was reported 
missing 
twentynine families were evacuated from their homes because the 
wrecked cars lay over an underground gas line by saturday night 
19 families still had to remain out of their houses including 
those houses hit in the derailment said theresa schroeder of the 
local red cross 
the 69car southern pacific freight hauling a sandy mineral 
raced down 4109foot cajon pass between the san bernardino and san 
gabriel mountains derailed on a curve and hit 11 homes about 740 
am friday 
the crew radioed to a dispatcher that it was out of control at 
90 mph 
the train was all over the place said a witness al dorame 
it looked like a toy in a sandbox some of the people thought 
it was an earthquake 
the dead were identified as stepbrothers jason thompson 9 and 
tyson white 7 conductor everett s crown 36 a 17year southern 
pacific employee and brakeman allan r reiss 44 an 18year 
employee whose body was not found until saturday morning 
three trainmen and six other people were injured 
one of the injured christopher shaw 24 survived for hours 
under the wreckage he was found friday evening later in a pocket 
of air under rail cars and the sandy cargo that crushed his home 
he had surgery to have a pin put in a broken leg and was in 
serious condition at san bernardino county medical center said 
nursing supervisor helen ramirez 
officials of the ntsb southern pacific the federal railroad 
administration and the brotherhood of locomotive engineers met to 
coordinate the investigation said ntsb spokesman ted lopatkiewicz 
plans included onsite investigations and study of three event 
recorders that monitored train functions they will certainly 
tell the speed of the train and might tell about brake 
application lopatkiewicz said 
investigators will also examine the train crews history of work 
performance and whether there was evidence of alcohol or drug use 
he said surviving crewmen will be interviewed but probably not 
saturday he said 
shaw was halfasleep when his home was flattened he lay there 
all day and into the night before he was found still conscious 
beneath the rubble 
rescuers extended an oxygen tube and encouraged him during the 
1 hours it took to free him debris had apparently formed a cave 
with enough oxygen to sustain him said gene brooks a rescue 
supervisor 
shaws mother maryann shaw watched nervously during the rescue 
i was so confused mrs shaw said i told him that his 
mama was outside and i was out here for him 
the train was going from mojave in the high desert to long beach 
with a load of sodium carbonate and sodium bicarbonate components 
of potash a mineral used to make fertilizer and soap railroad 
spokesmen said 
the tracks were expected to remain closed at least a day 
forcing the detour of 15 freights and two passenger trains

israels cabinet on sunday approved prime 
minister yitzhak shamirs longawaited plan for elections in the 
occupied west bank and gaza strip the vote was 206 
the fourpage 20point shamir plan passed easily largely 
because it sidestepped controversial points such as foreign 
supervision of elections participation of 140000 arabs in east 
jerusalem and a timetable for the balloting 
industry minister ariel sharon led rightwing opposition to the 
proposal he was joined in voting against the plan by two other 
ministers from the likud bloc members two from the centerleft 
labor and one from the national religious party 
sharon was quoted by an aide as telling the cabinet it was a 
sure recipe for more violence and terror and one that could raise 
a danger of war 
he was quoted by an aide as proposing his own sevenpoint plan 
which calls for extending israeli law to jewish settlements in the 
occupied lands an act equivalent to annexation 
sharon a member of shamirs likud bloc accused the cabinet of 
rushing into a decision because of the presence of a us state 
department delegation led by dennis ross chief of policy planning 
ross met with four moderate palestinians but 11 others boycotted 
the meeting in jerusalem the key topic was the elections proposal 
which palestinians made clear would have to be endorsed by the 
palestine liberation organization 
five palestinians who did not attend sent a letter to us 
officials criticizing the shamir plan as grossly deficient 
the daily yediot ahronot said us officials pushed for a 
timetable on elections it said shamir believed elections could be 
held within one year while defense minister yitzhak rabin estimated 
six months were needed 
in addition to the timetable the united states urged israel to 
allow 140000 east jerusalem arabs to vote and to permit 
international supervision of balloting 
shamirs plan does not refer to either issue it reportedly 
calls for electing 10 palestinians from the occupied territories to 
negotiate with israel on an interim period of autonomy with talks 
to begin after three years on the final status of the territories 
israel hopes the plan will help end the 17month palestinian 
uprising in the occupied territories in which at least 472 arabs 
and 21 israelis have been killed 
israel captured the west bank arab east jerusalem and the gaza 
strip from jordan and egypt in the 1967 middle east war israel 
later annexed east jerusalem

secret service was involved in south african efforts to obtain 
british missile technology 
the sunday telegraph a conservative weekly attributed its 
report to unidentified security sources in london it said the 
sources claimed mossad and the south african arms manufacturer 
armscor were linked to an operation that led to the arrests of five 
men in paris last month in an arms deal 
the report said the ultimate goal of the paris operation is 
thought to have been for south africa and israel to undertake joint 
development of a series of highspeed missiles for use by both 
ground and air forces 
it claimed three of the men arested in paris were northern 
ireland protestants who allegedly were negotiating with a south 
african diplomat and a us arms dealer to exchange british missile 
parts made in northern ireland for south african arms 
according to the newspaper the plan involved smuggling parts of 
the shoulderlaunched blowpipe missile to south africa to enable 
armscor to develop its own missiles it said mossad wanted to 
acquire the technology for britains starstreak missile 
both the blowpipe and starstreak missiles are made at the short 
brothers factory in belfast northern ireland 
the sunday telegraph said britains mi6 intelligence service was 
trying to determine how protestant activists in northern ireland 
received arms believed to have been purchased with south african 
money and shipped through militia groups in lebanon 
it is here that sources believe mossad actively assisted with 
the south african operation the newspaper said 
protestant and roman catholic militants have been battling in 
northern ireland for nearly 20 years the catholics want to unite 
the british province where protestants outnumber caholics 32

human rights activist andrei sakharov said 
sunday that the reforms of soviet president mikhail s gorbachev 
have not gone far enough to cure an ailing economy or bring 
democracy 
the 1975 nobel peace prize winner flew to italy on saturday with 
his wife yelena bonner to speak at an italian socialist party 
congress in the northern city of milan 
sakharov who was recently elected to the new soviet parliament 
said that while gorbachevs reforms were moving in the right 
direction in foreign affairs there are many aspects that are 
causing profound distress 
economic reforms go ever more slowly and the people are losing 
interest in their work because they cant buy anything he said 
he said the stagnation was occurring because the government 
dismantled old bureaucratic structures but has not created new ones 
the 67yearold physicist criticized gorbachev for emergency 
measures he had taken to limit demonstrations in the wake of 
nationalist uprisings 
we are in a blind alley and there have been various political 
decisions taken lately which i will not hesitate to define as 
antidemocratic he said 
sakharov was detained for nearly seven years in the northern 
city of gorky after he criticized the soviets 1979 military 
intervention in afghanistan

antigovernment activities was tortured to death by authorities

pathologists were helping cover up police involvement we cannot 
trust them he told the news conference

scottish nationalists blew up a stonecrushing 
plant because the quarry where it was located was going to be used 
as a nuclear waste dump an anonymous telephone caller claimed on 
sunday 
police have not commented on the cause of the fire saturday 
night that destroyed the fourstory plant at the glensanda granite 
quarry near the scottish town of oban on the movern peninsula 
there were no injuries 
press association the domestic news agency said it received a 
call at its london office from a man who claimed the plant was 
bombed by the scottish national liberation army

be used for the disposal of civilian and military nuclear waste 
the scottish group is a shadowy nationalist organization that 
has sent letter bombs to government ministers in recent years 
including prime minister margaret thatcher and secretary for 
scotland malcolm rifkind

the meeting between mikhail s gorbachev and deng 
xiaoping will alter a 30yearold constant in the geopolitical 
equation the sinosoviet split the result will be a more complex 
world with hazier alliances 
for gorbachev the dynamic 57yearold leader of the soviet 
union the visit is one step of many on his way into history 
he will bring his people peace on their southern flank said 
one asian diplomat he will also show the world that having dealt 
with the west he can now deal with the east 
for the 84yearold deng the summit could constitute the last 
waltz of a tumultuous 60year career as a soldier of the revolution 
and guiding force of the worlds most populous country 
a successful summit will be the icing on the cake of dengs 
career as a revolutionary said a western expert it will 
cement chinas standing as an international force 
the united states has welcomed the summit as a development 
destined to reduce international tensions but it also has been at 
pains to emphasize to beijing the importance washington attaches to 
its ties with china 
us officials reacted with glee when president bush managed a 
hurried visit in february months ahead of gorbachev they also 
expressed satisfaction that the us 7th fleet will arrive in 
shanghai on the heels of gorbachevs departure 
china for its part emphasizes that the summit does not mean a 
new socialist bloc on thursday foreign ministry spokesman jin 
guihua said china would not enter into alignment or develop 
strategic ties with any big power or power groups 
the summit will not be without drama both international and 
domestic 
chinese students who have been demonstrating for a month for 
democracy and freedom are planning a special welcoming session 
for the soviet leader wellregarded in this tightlycontrolled 
country for redefining the boundaries of dissent in his country 
coinciding with gorbachevs arrival soviet troops in mongolia 
begin their withdrawal as part of moscows promise to cut tensions 
on the sovietchinese border 
knowing gorbachevs penchant for unexpected gifts the meeting 
will not likely lack surprises 
two possibilities according to xing shugang a soviet expert at 
the chinese academy of social sciences would be to give ground on 
the border or provide a timetable for pledged withdrawal of 200000 
troops stationed near china 
hanging over the summit is a 10year war in cambodia that both 
nations say they want to end vietnam a soviet client state 
invaded cambodia and ousted the chinesebacked khmer rouge in 
december 1978 
china will attempt to keep cambodia in the foreground while the 
soviets will try to avoid the issue diplomats said 
the critical point according to diplomats is whether moscow 
will accept beijings desire to be the main peace broker thereby 
recognizing chinas traditional claim to influence in the region 
cambodia is the touchstone of the summit for the chinese 
said an asian diplomat speaking on condition of anonymity they 
will stop any communique until the last minute so they can get what 
they want 
for the russians he said the main goal is the symbolism 
of these meetings they are in a better position because they dont 
want anything specific 
solutions to other problems such as a border dispute and their 
world views depend on cambodia he said 
when communist china was founded in 1949 the soviet union was 
the first country to recognize it and china relied on soviet 
assistance to develop 
moscow and beijing signed a strategic alliance and thousands of 
soviet advisers flooded the country setting up industrial projects 
but relations soured in the late 1950s and early 1960s because 
of an ideological split centering around soviet leader nikita 
khrushchevs policy that socialist countries could peacefully 
coexist with countries in the west a personality clash between 
chinese leader mao tsetung and khrushchev added to the problem 
officials are optimistic this summit will be an improvement on 
the last one between khrushchev and mao in october 1959 when the 
soviet leader stormed to the airport with a dour look on his face 
relations hit a low point in 1969 when the two clashed 
repeatedly on the border 
but following political changes in both countries ties began to 
improve in the late 1970s trade began again and is now worth about 
325 billion a year

voters sunday chose from among writers a 
weightlifter a popular investigator and many others across the 
political spectrum in a secondround election to fill the remaining 
198 seats in a new parliament 
more than 1200 candidates an average of six per district were 
vying for seats in the congress of peoples deputies left open 
after march 26 elections the seats being contested were those in 
which no candidate received a majority of the vote 
in march voters rejected dozens of top government and party 
leaders in moscow kiev and leningrad most officials embarrassed 
on march 26 did not run again 
on sunday one district in leningrad fielded 34 candidates 
another in kiev had 33 in many districts another runoff election 
was likely before a winner was decided 
results were expected to trickle in monday or tuesday 
candidates included such figures as vitaly korotich the editor 
of ogonyok magazine in the ukrainian city of kharkov prosecutor 
nikolai ivanov an anticorruption crusader in leningrad olympic 
weightlifting champion yuri vlasov and playwright mikhail shatrov 
in moscow commentator alexander bovin and anatoly ivanov editor 
of the ultraconservative monthly molodaya gvardiya in zagorsk 
the new 2250member parliament was created by soviet president 
mikhail s gorbachev in a reform that he said will strengthen the 
legislature it will choose the president and the new ruling 
supreme soviet but less than two weeks from the may 25 first 
meeting many of its functions and procedures have yet to be 
decided 
in moscows kunsovsky district a retired army colonel said he 
and many other veterans voted for afghan war hero alexander 
rudskoy we fought during the last war and understand the man 
well said the colonel who refused to identify himself 
in leningrad prosecutor ivanov who led a broad anticorruption 
probe was a favorite among 33 candidates seeking a seat 
in kiev another 33 candidates were seeking the seat that local 
communist party leader konstantin masyk lost march 26 among them 
was theater director les taniuk a leader of the peoples front 
group that seeks greater independence for the baltic republics 
in the baltic republics there were eight races one candidate in 
the latvian capital of riga was prosecutor janis djenitis a party 
hardliner who topped the list of most unpopular latvians in a poll 
conducted last year by a youth newspaper another was political 
reformer mavrick wulfson 
the first vote on march 26 hurt the communist partys prestige 
gorbachev said it showed soviets were enthusiastic about reforms 
but frustrated that local leaders were lagging behind 
of the 198 seats up in sundays election 195 were in districts 
were voters rejected the choices given them in march in three 
districts in armenia repeat elections were held because fewer than 
half of the voters participated the first time

when president bush looks for votes on capitol 
hill to sustain a minimum wage bill veto or win passage of his 
savings and loan bailout plan his clout is limited by the fact 
most congressmen ran far ahead of him in their districts last 
november 
house members and political analysts differ among themselves on 
the impact of bushs lack of coattails 
but there is no argument that while bush was carrying 40 of the 
50 states voters by the millions were opting for divided 
government by choosing a republican president and a democratic 
congress 
there was a big message in this election and george bush 
picked it up said rep tony coelho of california the house 
democratic whip 
coelho praised bush for trying to establish a level of trust 
that hasnt existed for 12 years 
you run independent of everyone said republican rep lynn 
martin of illinois 
but she insisted that a presidents persuasive ability is not 
tied to the results of the last election 
if the president calls you and asks you to vote for something 
any living member of congress who says it is easy to say no is 
absolutely saying that for a press statement she said after 
the election it isnt democrat or republican its the president 
an analysis of the 1988 election results published in the 
national journal found that bush ran ahead of the successful house 
candidate in only 56 of the 435 house districts 
bush out polled only 26 republicans and 30 democrats half of 
the democrats were from the south bushs strongest region in the 
presidential vote 
while those numbers might be viewed as a sign of the presidents 
electoral weakness they might more accurately reflect the strength 
of house members of the 435 house winners in 1988 only 63 
received under 60 percent of the vote 
by contrast when ronald reagan was elected in 1980 he ran 
ahead of 59 republican winners in addition his coattails were 
credited with giving republicans control of the senate for the 
first time in a quarter century and with a gop pickup of 33 house 
seats 
did that make a difference 
it was very easy to deal with reluctant republicans or 
persuadable democrats during reagans first two years in office 
said rich bond a republican consultant who was involved in trying 
to generate support for reagans agenda 
reagans clout on capitol hill diminished sharply after the 1982 
midterm election when the democrats won back 26 house seats 
it was back to business as usual said bond 
ive always been the republican in whose district our 
presidential candidates did least well said rep bill green of 
new york whose district runs along the east side of manhattan 
green was reelected with 61 percent of the vote while bush was 
receiving only 33 percent against democrat michael dukakis 
i was the only republican elected in a district reagan didnt 
carry in 84 said green 
green describes himself as a progressive republican and his 
support for reagan in house votes declined from a high of 55 
percent of the time in 1981 to 38 percent in 1986 according to 
congressional quarterly 
the new york congressman said plainly in 1981 one of the 
things reagan had going for him in winning votes in congress was 
the ability to persuade marginal democrats in certain parts of the 
country that if they didnt come along theyd be very vulnerable in 
1982 
obviously that kind of capacity is lacking for bush at this 
point 
tom mann director of governmental studies at the brookings 
institution said were getting to the point where there will be 
zero correlation between presidential and congressional returns 
it reinforces the view on capitol hill that their electoral 
fates are not shared with the president and therefore there are no 
electoral ties that bind whatever incentives they have for working 
with the president elections are not one of them 
not many members of congress are going to quake in their boots 
when presidents try to force them to do things said norman 
ornstein a political scientist at the american enterprise 
institute 
presidents win by big margins presidents win by small 
margins members of congress go marching on he said 
stephen hess who served on the white house staffs of presidents 
eisenhower and nixon said members of congress get a sense of a 
presidents clout in their districts from polls and letters and 
from their trips back home 
they dont need to look at last novembers election returns to 
know how well george bush stands in their district and of course 
george bush probably stands in their district better than he did on 
november 8 
a president is not a hapless giant said hess there are 
appointments members want there are grants that they want there 
are an awful lot of symbolic things that they want 
lynn martin echoed that view 
what the president has to offer members is not really 
electability she said its coming in for fundraisers it is 
the white house it is members feeling they are working with the 
president of the united states to accomplish something

emigration from the soviet union is soaring to 
new heights sending thousands of germans armenians pentecostals 
as well as jews on their way to new lives in other countries 
in the first four months of this year 57000 exit permits were 
granted while the soviets also moved closer to adopting laws that 
will ease most of the restrictions of the past 
richard schifter director of the state departments human 
rights office was shown drafts of some of the legislation in 
moscow where he worked on the human rights issue before and during 
the twoday visit last week of secretary of state james a baker 
iii 
beginning in september soviet lawyers and judges will be coming 
to the united states for extended visits to study american legal 
procedures another sign of the changes brought about by soviet 
president mikhail s gorbachev 
jewish emigration from the soviet union reached an alltime high 
in 1979 as superpower relations were improved during the period 
known as detente that year 51320 left the country with visas for 
israel but most of them wound up in the united states 
last month 4557 jews left the highest figure for any single 
month since october 1979 the peak year 
the issuance of 57000 permits this january through april points 
to a new record though actual departure generally lags for a few 
months behind receipt of a permit 
schifter said the figures break down this way 27000 ethnic 
germans were granted permits to go to west germany 17500 jews for 
israel 3500 pentecostals for israel 5000 armenians for the 
united states and 4000 others for the united states and elsewhere 
if past practice is a guide nearly 90 percent of the jews with 
permits for israel will revise their destinations once they have 
left the soviet union and most of them will come to the united 
states 
pentecostals who also contend authorities severely restrict 
their religious practices are invariably given permits for israel 
and also wind up elsewhere 
schifter was encouraged by the projected changes in soviet law 
as well as by the rise in emigration 
while in moscow he was shown a draft of a decree that would 
repeal a requirement that a wouldbe emigrant have an invitation 
from a close relative 
the restriction had been applied to german ethnics seeking 
permission to go to west germany and to jews and pentecostals 
schifter also was shown a draft of another legal directive 
abolishing the right of parents to block the departure of wouldbe 
emigrants 
the soviets he said also are lowering another barrier 
involvement in the past in sensitive work 
all prospective emigrants who were engaged in securityrelated 
occupations will be eligible for permits five years after leaving 
the job 
there will be special exceptions but only highlevel officials 
rather than bureaucrats in the security agencies will have the 
power to invoke them 
the easing of the restriction will not be retroactive but 
schifter said soviet authorities said they would consider old 
applications in light of the new rules 
the state department official said a new law assuring freedom of 
religion would leave the ukrainian catholic church as the only 
problem 
he said soviet authorities consider the church a source of 
ukrainian nationalism 
generally though most of the signs are positive 
one example all the jewish refuseniks invited to the us 
embassy for a passover seder in 1987 attended also by 
thensecretary of state george p shultz some 40 of whom 
previously had been denied visas have since been permitted to 
leave the country

the battle of the breakfasts when 33869 locals turned out to dine 
on thousands of pounds of pancakes washed down with 600 gallons of 
coffee 
springfield claimed the title of worlds biggest breakfast 
saturday morning when volunteers who had spent 12 hours mixing 
pancake batter served up a fourhour meal that would not have won 
approval from weight watchers 
the pancake recipe included 3000 pounds of flour 600 egg yolks 
and 400 gallons of water the final product was drenched in 200 
gallons of maple syrup 
were getting it down to a science said amy barron a 
spokeswoman for the event 
but the citys claim to glory could be fleeting battle creek 
mich citizens will try to reclaim the title next month when they 
convene to share their own mass breakfast 
the springfield eatathon marked the 14th time that the city 
which is celebrating its 353rd birthday has gone up against battle 
creek

bicentennial bid to wrest battle creeks record for the world 
largest breakfast table 
last year battle creek claimed a turnout of 32000 and 
springfield had 31279 
the michigan city had established its claim during celebrations

two soviet trade officials arrived in 
taiwan on sunday for an international economic meeting the first 
known visit by soviet officials to this staunchly anticommunist 
island 
yuri v akhremenko and vladimir ivanov are to attend as 
observers the threeday annual meeting of the pacific basin 
economic council which promotes economic cooperation in the 
pacific rim 
during a stopover in tokyo the two were quoted by taiwanese 
reporters as saying the soviet union intended to become a member of 
the council 
their arrival came as soviet president mikhail s gorbachev flew 
to china for the first sovietchinese summit in three decades 
about 300 bankers and business leaders from 14 countries and 
territories are to attend the taiwan conference which begins 
tuesday 
akhremenko is executive secretary of the soviet unions national 
committee for asia pacific economic cooperation ivanov is chairman 
of the pacific region research department of the institute of world 
economics and international relations 
taiwan has issued special travel permits instead of entry visas 
to the soviet representatives foreign ministry officials said the 
ministry would not stamp official seals on their passports to avoid 
giving the impression that taiwan recognizes the soviet union 
the nationalist government on taiwan has no diplomatic ties with 
the soviet union and has long considered it a hostile nation 
the nationalists who fled to taiwan in 1949 after losing a 
civil war to communist forces on the mainland have claimed the 
soviets aided the chinese communists victory 
however taiwans indirect trade with the soviet union has grown 
significantly in the past year as the government adopted a more 
liberal trade policy to promote trade exchanges with countries in 
eastern europe 
last year taiwans indirect exports to the soviet union totaled 
35 million up about fivefold from 1987 while imports from the 
soviet union increased threefold in the same period totaling 31 
million 
in march two soviet women were allowed to participate in an 
international beauty pageant in taiwan they were the first soviet 
citizens to be issued entry visas to taiwan

baltic activists sunday called for 
economic independence from moscow by next year and demanded a trial 
of soviet officials blamed for killing or deporting thousands of 
countrymen 
the first gathering of grassroots peoples fronts groups from 
the baltic republics of estonia latvia and lithuania stopped short 
of demanding independence for their oncesovereign homelands 
but the 400 activists meeting in the house of political 
education in the estonian capital urged moscow not to obstruct 
the restoration of state sovereignty in their homelands some 
said the wording was a legal prelude to independence 
in the final session of the twoday meeting the baltic assembly 
said president mikhail s gorbachevs political reforms failed to 
halt economic decline and the assembly called for economic 
independence from moscow by early next year 
the resolution said the republics have the right to choose any 
economic system that would meet material needs protect the 
environment and break the stranglehold of moscowbased planners 
and officials 
the assembly rejected a kremlin plan that would concede control 
over food and consumer products to the republics but retain control 
over energy and at least half of regional heavy industry 
another resolution demanded that national leaders recognize the 
stalinist genocide in estonia latvia and lithuania and convene 
a trial of its perpetrators similar to the nuremberg trials of nazi 
war criminals after world war ii 
the baltic republics were absorbed by the soviets in 1940 in a 
secret deal between the nazis and dictator josef stalin hundreds 
of thousands of baltic residents were deported or killed under 
stalin including 80000 in 1941 alone the assembly draft charges 
in a separate closeddoor meeting 61 baltic representatives 
elected in march to a new soviet parliament the congress of 
peoples deputies hammered out a common platform to take to the 
inaugural session that begins may 25 
in four resolutions including an appeal to all congressional 
deputies the baltic lawmakers called for radical perestroika 
and asserted each republics right to selfdetermination and choice 
of its own historical path perestroika refers to gorbachevs 
policy of political reforms 
the appeal was designed to rally all progressive deputies 
wherever they may come from in order to find a common path to solve 
economic social and ecological problems in the soviet union 
said estonian popular front leader marju lauristin 
she told the assembly that the lawmakers also discussed 
formation of a coalition with other progressive congress deputies 
so the struggle for perestroika can go on 
such a coalition would be the first faction created in the new 
parliament

grief returned sunday to this closeknit 
community which marked the first anniversary of a fiery bus crash 
that killed 24 teenagers and three adults returning from a church 
outing 
anniversaries are always bad mayor joseph hutcherson said 
and of course its mothers day too that will have quite an 
impact im afraid 
hutcherson said thousands of people were expected for 
observances that were to include the unveiling of a monument 
listing the victims of one of the worst bus crashes in us 
history a memorial service also was scheduled at a high school 
stadium 
because of parking limitations those attended the observances 
were being brought in from local shopping centers on school buses 
the irony was not lost on the rev mark denney who heads the 
community memorial committee 
i dont think there ever will be a bus outing in this 
community that is planned without concern for that carefree outing 
that became so tragic denney said 
the old school bus owned by the radcliff first assembly of god 
was carrying 67 passengers home for a trip to a cincinnati 
amusement park when it was hit by a pickup truck going the wrong 
way on interstate 71 near carrollton ky on may 14 1988 
the truck driver larry mahoney of owen county will be tried in 
november on 27 counts of murder and count of driving while 
intoxicated 
the tragedy has prompted some in the community to campaign 
against drunken driving 
this is a crusade for me said army sgt lee williams who 
lost his wife and two daughters in the crash 
others said their goal has been simply returning to a normal 
life 
drunk driving might be the worst thing in the world but i 
cant do anything about it now said david voglund whose 
13yearold daughter was killed in the smashup 
im still trying to distance myself from the whole thing 
because i feel better that way he said although he still thinks 
about his daughter every day voglund said he has found an ally in 
the passage of time 
you dont feel nearly as lousy as you did six months ago he 
said were probably eventually going to be in pretty good shape 
life does get better or at least it has for us

warner records is betting on zvuki mu even though 
its flashy lead singer peter mamonov insists on singing in 
russian columbia is going with boris grebenshikov a rock n roll 
switchhitter who can belt em out in both russian and english 
its all part of a rush by major entertainment companies to 
bring out albums by soviet rock musicians 
the companies hope the curiosity of americans about contemporary 
russia will sell records they say the gorbachev era has made 
soviet culture a hot product 
but record executives have widely varying views of how authentic 
a sound the public will pay to hear some are deliberately 
westernizing the music prompting critics to say americans are 
missing the real soundtrack of glasnost 
at one end of the spectrum is grebenshikovs solo album radio 
silence which columbia records plans to release in june ten of 
the 12 songs are in english and were written especially for the 
album all were recorded in the west by a successful british 
producer david stewart of the rock group the eurythmics 
it has poetic dreamy lyrics that are not overtly political or 
even distinctively russian in content aside from the raspy voice 
of the chainsmoking ponytailed grebenshikov radio silence 
bears little resemblance to his wildly popular leningrad band 
akvarium aquarium which has sold 35 million official albums and 
countless underground tapes in the soviet union 
jack rovner columbia vice president for marketing said 
grebenshikov himself decided to do the album in english because 
otherwise the musics appeal obviously would have limitations 
some record companies however are taking the plunge into 
russian lyrics 
in late april opalwarner bros released an album entirely in 
russian by zvuki mu a moscow band whose name means sounds of 
mu a tongueincheek tribute both to the sound of music and 
to the mooing of cows 
like columbia opalwarner used a bigname western producer 
brian eno but the recording was made in a moscow studio and 
preserved zvuki mus homegrown flavor a blend of intellectual rock 
and funk the initial 50000 records cassettes and compact disks 
have just reached the stores 
zvuki mu is scheduled to bring its rambunctious stage act to new 
yorks lincoln center in july grebenshikov also is planning a us 
tour probably in the fall 
of all the new releases perhaps the most authentic is gruppa 
krovi blood type a collection of russian protest songs and 
dance numbers by singerpoet viktor tsoi and his punk group kino 
cinema the album was recorded in the apartment of one of the 
band members 
joanna stingray an american singer married to kino guitarist 
yuri kasparyan said she recently sat in a plush leningrad 
restaurant with a group of soviet rock performers reminiscing 
about the old days when they literally went hungry 
today she said top soviet stars travel back and forth to the 
west and earn tens of thousands of dollars from record contracts 
as well as commanding thousands of rubles per concert in the soviet 
union 
it used to be they couldnt afford a taxi ride home at 
night stingray said now they are getting rich at least by 
soviet standards 
kinos fourtrack recording was released in april by gold castle 
records a small los angeles label but has the muscle of capitol 
records distribution network behind it 
we wanted to make sure it was the real russian stuff said 
gold castle promotion director jeff heiman that seemed like the 
hippest thing to do 
it is also the smallest release at 10000 copies an example of 
the tradeoff between artistic integrity and commercial success 
that worries stingray and others on both sides of the rapidly 
parting iron curtain 
artemy troitsky a moscow rock impresario has warned that the 
newfound respectability of soviet groups is fraught with peril not

congress offers a classic example of the 
fickleness of politics this week as it considers a federal budget 
worked out in advance with president bush and a minimum wage 
increase that sets lawmakers and the white house on a collision 
course 
the house and senate will demonstrate how cooperative they can 
be with the bush administration when they consider the 117 
trillion budget for fiscal 1990 negotiators from the two chambers 
completed work on a final version of the plan last thursday and 
final passage of the spending plan is expected to be little more 
than an exercise in rubberstamping 
the budget for the fiscal year that begins oct 1 would hold 
natural resources transportation agriculture and veterans 
programs to growth rates below the rate of inflation it would also 
limit defense spending to 2992 billion 42 billion below what 
would be needed to keep up with natural cost increases 
but it would boost beyond inflation federal efforts for science 
education and health programs a looming dispute between bush and 
democrats over how to collect 53 billion in additional tax 
receipts has been postponed until later 
overall the spending blueprint claims to compress the federal 
deficit to 997 billion just within the 100 billion limit set 
in the grammrudman balancedbudget law 
the harmony between the two branches was set in motion by a 
deficitreduction deal they reached last month but when it comes 
to their views on the minimum wage bush and the 
democraticcontrolled congress are anything but in harmony 
last thursday the house passed legislation that would increase 
the 335perhour minimum wage to 455 by october 1991 the 
senate is poised to pass a similar measure this week and bush is 
already threatening veto 
the white house prefers a version that would limit the increase 
to 425 by january 1992 its version would also impose a 
subminimum wage for six months as opposed to the 60day training 
wage congressional democrats prefer 
democrats seem unlikely to be able to muster the twothirds 
majorities in both houses that would be needed to override a veto 
but they are pressing the issue anyway in an attempt to position 
themselves politically as the friend of the countrys working class 
more fireworks could come when congress considers a domestic 
spending bill with money for this year most of the money in it is 
for veterans and for college loans but the most controversial 
provision would provide about 300 million this year for antidrug 
programs 
rep neal smith riowa chairman of the appropriations justice 
subcommittee has said he wants to pay for the spending by using 
part of the 650 million fine drexel burnham lambert inc is 
scheduled to pay for securities violations other lawmakers 
however believe spending cuts must be made in other programs to 
offset the drug spending 
if the entire package contains too much new spending 
administration officials have said bush might veto the measure the 
final size of the bill will not be known until early this week 
the senate also plans to vote on a resolution aimed at halting a 
proposed deal between the united states and japan to jointly 
produce a new warplane 
president bush wants to move ahead with the 7 billion 
arrangement under which general dynamics and mitsubishi heavy 
industries would jointly produce the fsx fighter the plane a 
modernized version of the american f16 would be deployed by japan 
in the late 1990s 
the question has sparked debate between supporters who stress 
the importance of usjapanese cooperation and opponents who say 
the proposal would cost american jobs and constitute a giveaway of 
us technology 
a similar disapproval resolution has been introduced in the 
house if the measures are passed and vetoed by bush it would take 
a twothirds vote in each chamber to block the deal

in the upper room a plotless ballet 
choreographed by twyla tharp to music by philip glass is an 
exhilarating athletic work that doesnt give its american ballet 
theater dancers a moment to stop 
the dancers at the metropolitan opera are forever twirling 
traveling all over the stage 
watching in the upper room one can be reminded of a time 
when male dancers lifted women hands on their waists and set them 
down again 
in saturday nights company premiere of in the upper room 
miss tharp has choreographed seven ways to sunday to lift 
ballerinas including one in which the dancer rolls around the back 
of her partners neck and slides down his other side 
one of the most interesting variations has three ballerinas put 
their arms over each others shoulders facing the audience like a 
chorus line their partners pick them up their legs dangling 
without breaking the lineup 
the dance has nine parts tempos vary one has to be familiar 
with glass music to discern melodies but two of the sections 
sounded like his opera akhnaten 
the stage seemed to be in a fog which sometimes poured from the 
wings and at other times was done by gray lighting by jennifer 
tipton 
at first the dancers were dressed in light gray with accents of 
red red shoes red socks and red belts as in the upper room 
progressed costumes designed by norma kamali became all or 
mostly red 
twyla tharp is artistic associate of the american ballet 
theater having disbanded her twyla tharp dance troupe 
the evening began with les sylphides with elegant 
effortlesslooking dancing by andris liepa a guest artist from the 
bolshoi ballet his partners were cheryl yeager julie kent and 
leslie browne the corps de ballet dancing like a dream in 
floating white chiffon is prominent in this 1908 ballet 
choreographed by michel fokine to chopin music 
george balanchines prodigal son choreographed in 1929 from 
the bible story to prokofiev music had danilo radojevic dancing 
the title role with power and naivete cynthia gregory was 
glitteringly cold as the siren who tempts him then tosses him to

the new executive director of the john 
birch society insists that his conservative groups relocation to 
the birthplace of the late sen joseph mccarthy is nothing but a 
happy coincidence 
community leaders who have long dissociated themselves from 
mccarthys reckless anticommunism agree that its a coincidence 
although not one that makes everyone happy 
it was more of an accident that joe mccarthy was born here and 
its more of an accident that the john birch society is moving 
here said michael obrien a university of wisconsin professor 
who has written a book on the activities that led to mccarthys 
censure by the senate in 1954 
the birch society a conservative political organization that 
emphasizes anticommunism and reducing the size of us government 
announced in march that it was closing its headquarters in belmont 
mass and san marino calif and moving them to appleton a city 
of 65000 on the banks of the fox river in eastcentral wisconsin 
employees are due to begin moving in this week 
since the announcement city officials have repeatedly denied 
that the arrival of the society will affect the citys image 
i dont think anyone is frightened and certainly no one is 
alarmed mayor dorothy johnson said i dont think anyone will 
be much affected by the coming of the john birch society its 
fairly esoteric we have people of all persuasions 
mccarthy who was born in nearby grand chute is not the only 
appletonarea native who has gained the town some notoriety in 
addition to the annual memorial at mccarthys grave in st marys 
cemetery there is a seance each halloween for the late magician 
and escape artist harry houdini who was born and raised here 
but those events city officials say are oddities in what is 
otherwise a typical midwest community a republican stronghold 
that is gradually shedding its rural roots for a more urban 
economy johnson who has been mayor since 1980 calls it the 
best of middle america 
g allen bubolz 52 who stepped down as an executive at secura 
insurance in appleton to become executive director of the birch 
society said the group chose appleton as its new headquarters 
because he lives there not because of the citys ties to 
conservatism or mccarthys legacy 
however he said the fact that mccarthy was born there is a 
happy irony 
were quite pleased because sen joe mccarthy was a great 
american a stalwart of patriotism a warrior of the evils of 
communism its a happy coincidence he said 
the society was founded in 1958 by 11 men including william j 
grede founder of grede foundries in milwaukee and robert welch a 
retired candy company executive it was named after john m birch 
a baptist missionary and us army captain who was killed by 
chinese communists a few days after world war ii ended 
the organization now claims several tens of thousands of 
members who meet in local chapters around the nation bubolz said 
he said the organizations militant anticommunism has given way 
to a less aggressive style although he stressed that the societys 
underlying philosophy hasnt changed 
outagamie county supervisor ronald vandervelden who led a 
futile fight to remove a lifesize bust of mccarthy from the 
courthouse in appleton three years ago said hes worried that the 
birch society leaders might try integrating their philosophies 
into state and local government 
but william j welch president of the fox cities chamber of 
commerce and no relation to the birch society founder dismissed 
such worries 
the last time i checked the john birch society wasnt 
advocating the violent overthrow of the united states government 
welch said and quite frankly if they have any problem it is 
that people dont take them quite that seriously

when federal investigators open 
hearings this week into the nations largest oil spill they will 
be looking for answers to fundamental questions that so far have 
stymied authorities 
coast guard personnel exxon executives and crew members from 
the tanker exxon valdez all face scrutiny as the national 
transportation safety board in five days of hearings beginning 
tuesday tries to solve these mysteries 
why did the 987foot tanker stray far from estabished shipping 
lanes and rip its singlesheath bottom open on bligh reef a 
wellcharted obstacle about 25 miles from valdez 
was the captain joseph hazelwood 42 of huntington ny 
intoxicated at the time of the crash 
how long was the vessel stranded before the crew reported the 
accident to the coast guard 
did the crews frenzied attempts to free the ship by 
rocking it off the reef widen the gash in the hull spilling 
still more oil into the icy water 
did the coast guard the oil industry exxon and state 
officials react promptly to the emergency 
the boards final report wont be completed for nine to 12 
months board spokeswoman drucella anderson said we hope to 
determine the probable cause and make some safety 
recommendations she said 
although the focus of attention shifts from valdez to the 
hearings in anchorage this week the hard work continued sunday in 
prince william sound where the accident took place and where crews 
are still trying to clean fouled beaches 
the coast guard continued its reconnaissance flights over the 
spill the flights were ordered to help halibut fishermen avoid 
polluted areas on monday when their 24hour commercial season 
opens 
oil sightings will be relayed to fishermen by radio coast 
guard spokesman dennis hubbard said sunday whatever weve got 
were using c130s helicopters whatever 
it has been nearly two months since the catastrophe changed life 
in what had been a quiet fishing village 
the trouble began shortly after midnight on march 24 when the 
exxon valdez its 13 tanks filled with north slope crude from the 
transalaska pipeline slammed into a reef shrouded in darkness 
the crippled vessel quickly began hemorrhaging oil by latest 
estimate 109 million gallons into the pristine waters of prince 
william sound 
the sound named after the third son of englands king george 
iii is one of alaskas most popular and scenic recreational areas 
teeming with animals fish and birds 
the huge vessel apparently maneuvering to avoid the glittering 
ice chunks cast into the sound by columbia glacier swerved from 
its outbound lane and across the incoming zone then continued 
miles off course toward the submerged jagged outcropping 
minutes before the crash the crew apparently aware that their 
vessel was at risk frantically tried to avoid the reef according 
to an analysis of radio traffic between the exxon valdez and the 
coast guard 
then in the words of helmsman robert kagan the exxon valdez 
went for a bumpy ride 
as its massive hull scraped along the reef it scooped up 
boulders the size of automobiles and stuffed them into its huge oil 
tanks 
weve fetched hard aground were leaking oil were going 
to be here a while i just wanted to make a report hazelwood 
radioed shortly after 1220 am as he spoke the crude gushed into 
the water 
in the more than seven weeks since the crash oil has spread 
some 450 miles southwest of valdez fouling shorelines throughout 
prince william sound and along the alaska coast to wide bay near 
kodiak island the oiled beaches include those of the spectacular 
katmai national park 
to probe the accident the transportation board has assembled 
what it describes as a panel of inquiry one board member to 
conduct the proceedings staff members and investigators to sift 
the evidence and representatives of each ofthe four parties having 
a direct interest in the proceedings 
those are the state of alaska exxon the coast guard and 
alyeska the oil industrys jointly owned company that operates the 
800milelong transalaska pipeline 
the chairman for the hearings is lee dickenson the only member 
of the board who will be present in anchorage later in 
washington dc the full board will consider the evidence 
developed from the anchorage testimony 
unlike a court of law the ntsbs rules specifically bar lawyers 
from posing questions instead representatives of each of the four 
parties at interest directly question the witnesses as does 
dickenson 
crew members from the exxon valdez are scheduled to testify 
first followed by coast guard personnel representatives of exxon 
and alyeska and winding up on the final day with more coast guard 
officials 
one person who wont be at the hearings is hazelwood who 
declined to testify but who offered information in writing to the 
board hazelwood has been charged in an alaska court with three 
misdemeanor counts that include operating a vessel while drunk and 
his trial is scheduled to begin june 20 in valdez

first lady barbara bush urged graduates 
of tiny bennett college on sunday to heed the example set by 19th 
century black activist frederick douglass and help people 
enslaved by ignorance to become educated members of society 
someday in your lives the walls will part and youll see a 
little frederick douglass mrs bush said in a commencement 
address at the predominantly black liberal arts college for women 
i hope that you will remember the abiding principles and 
values that we learned when we were young and i hope you will say 
i want to be fair and i want to share it can be done and i want 
to help you do it 
mrs bush was awarded an honorary doctorate of humane letters by 
the college which was founded in 1873 in her speech said 
douglass had been one of her heroes since she read the 
autobiography of the onetime slave who became a scholar and writer 
she said she was particularly struck by douglass account of 
overhearing his owner admonishing his wife not to teach slaves how 
to read because doing so would make them impossible to control 
frederick douglass revelation holds true today mrs bush 
said there are many types of slavery and education is the key 
to freedom 
the first lady who is active in literacy programs and is 
honorary chairperson of the national advisory council of literacy 
volunteers of america challenged the 92 graduates to help the 
young modern frederick douglasses out there today who are enslaved 
by ignorance help them learn their abcs and escape she said 
the ceremony was held beneath overcast skies on the schools 
grassy quadrangle lined with oak trees 
mrs bush walked at the rear of the procession wearing a black 
academic gown and cap and a triple trand of pearls as she 
approached the dais a child handed her a dozen red roses 
mrs bush the mother of five and grandmother of 11 said her 
honorary doctorate was a wonderful mothers day present for me 
her speech was laced with jokes about children but she said the 
basic lessons learned in early childhood form the basis of adult 
character 
she also challenged the graduates to follow the example of 
dorothy brown who despite being an orphan graduated from bennett 
college in 1941 and went on to become a surgeon and tennessee 
legislator she quoted mrs brown as having said i havent 
accepted defeat not my entire life 
the speech was the only commencement address mrs bush will 
deliver this year according to press secretary anna perez the 
first lady chose to accept bennetts invitation because she met the 
colleges president gloria r scott in a white house rose garden 
ceremony earlier this year

after maines swollen rivers gave residents in lowlying areas a 
scare without causing major damage 
while spectators lined riverbanks to gawk and take pictures of 
the high water meteorologists continued to keep a close watch on 
levels of the rainfilled waterways said george wiseman of the 
national weather service 
several families living along the androscoggin river in auburn 
and lewiston had been asked to evacuate their homes as water filled 
basements and forced the shutoff of electric utilities on saturday 
on sunday police said they had no reports of evacuations having 
taken place 
its nothing major at all said lewiston police officer john 
moyer its not nearly what it was back in 87 when floods 
caused tens of millions of dollars in damage across maine 
this weekend spectators casually watched the androscoggins 
waters rush over great falls and cascade onto rocks below in 
lewistons downtown section 
rising waters flooded several roads in central and southern

the oldest mother whos a regular at the 
international mothers day shrine is easy to shop for this time of 
year 
usually they send flowers but i told them if i couldnt eat 
it or wear it dont send it said carrie marshall who at 98 was 
the oldest mother attending sundays services at the church where 
mothers day began in 1908 
mrs marshalls 71yearold son charles jr is a member of the 
grafton mothers day committee 
the committees roots go back 81 years to the time when anna 
jarvis of grafton wanted to set aside a day to honor her mother 
also named anna jarvis who had organized a mothers friendship day 
after the civil war to unite families who had split because of the 
conflict 
when mrs jarvis died on may 9 1905 anna became determined to 
establish mothers day 
on may 10 1908 the first mothers day service was held in 
andrews methodist church which has since become the international 
mothers day shrine and is used only for mothers day services and 
an occasional wedding 
this year the sunday services attracted about 200 visitors not 
quite enough to fill up the church said betty hayhurst the 
director of the shrine for six years 
this year marks the 75th anniversary of federal recognition for 
mothers day and if the holiday seems overly commercialized today 
its interesting to note that its founder was concerned about that 
decades ago 
like mrs marshall the younger anna jarvis didnt want to see 
flowers deliverered on mothers day 
theyre commercializing my mothers day she once wrote to 
newspapers i wanted it to be a day of sentiment not of profit 
flowers are about halfdead by the time theyre delivered you 
ought to give your mother something useful something permanent 
a maudlin and insincere printed card or a readymade telegram 
means nothing except that youre too lazy to write to the woman who 
has done more for you than anyone else in the world

claims of clairvoyance to charm mexicos elite and attract drug 
traffickers and cultists willing to do anything for their 
godfather a newspaper reported 
constanzo who ordered his own execution and that of companion 
martin quintana rodriguez as police closed in may 6 on his mexico 
city residence has been linked to as many as 24 slayings 15 that 
were discovered last month outside matamoros mexico and many that 
included ritualistic sacrifices 
those who knew him said constanzo built a career as a reader to 
the stars the dallas morning news reported in sundays editions 
his clients included topranking police and government officials 
and popular entertainers according to statements last week by his 
family followers and authorities some clients paid as much as 
8000 a session for his predictions and ritual cleansings that 
promised good luck family members told the newspaper 
he would tell rich people what to do how to make things 
better and since what he would say would happen they would pay 
him 30000 or 40000 said constanzos brother fausto 
rodriguez 21 of miami 
authorities depict constanzo 26 as a bisexual who had affairs 
with several members of his cult and wore rubies sapphires and 
diamonds on every finger drove a 1989 mercedesbenz and twice 
bought a boyfriend 10000 worth of clothes in brownsville texas 
constanzos mother delia gonzalez del valle of miami described 
her son as a homebody who kept a neat house cared about his family 
and had few close friends as a youngster but she said constanzo 
had striking good looks charisma and what appeared to his admirers 
to be an everincreasing clairvoyance 
people were always asking whos that everybody believing 
he was somebody and asking if hes a movie star mrs gonzalez 
told the morning news he had cachet 
and she said he knew things 
a high school dropout constanzo predicted former president 
reagan would be shot in 1980 but would survive mrs gonzalez

pop singer oscar athie actress irma serrana and renowned 
hairstylist alfredo palacios all of them have denied any link to 
the cult 
athie said constanzos followers harassed him for more than a 
year because he rejected their requests to perform in concert and 
pay for a ritual cleansing

powers and for 2000 or 3000 i could be cleansed for good 
luck athie told the newspaper when he refused athie said

rival drug gangs and feuding family members in return for 50

rep tony coelho acknowledged sunday that a 
california savings and loan executive set him up in a junk bond 
investment that netted the congressman a 6882 profit without him 
having to put up any of his own money 
coelho released a detailed report of the arrangement in which 
the sampl executive purchased the 100000 in bonds for coelho and 
held them until coelho could raise money to pay for them in part 
with a loan subsequently obtained from the executives sampl 
except for some reporting errors coelho said the 1986 deal was 
totally above board 
the california congressman as majority whip the no 3 democrat 
in the house released his attorneys review of the financial 
transaction the review was begun after the washington post last 
month first reported on coelhos investment in the high yield bonds 
according to the report coelho first considered investing his 
1986 campaign funds in 12 percent bonds based on a suggestion by 
thomas spiegel chief executive officer of the columbia savings and 
loan assn of beverly hills calif 
although coelho ruled out that type purchase for his campaign 
spiegel suggested that coelho himself could make an investment in 
the bonds which were being issued for a corporate takeover 
when coelho could not come up with the 100000 by the required 
purchase date of may 5 spiegel bought the bonds himself and held 
them for a month while coelho completed his financing half of 
which came from spiegels bank 
at that point coelho bought the bonds from spiegel and paid him 
interest equivalent to what the bonds made during that period when 
the congressman sold the bonds in october 1986 he was able to pay 
back his loans and realize a 6882 profit in four months 
coelhos lawyer robert f bauer concluded that spiegels role 
could not be construed as a gift which would violate house 
rules since coelho paid him interest he also said the original 
issuing of the bond to coelhos campaign committee instead of the 
congressman was a clerical error 
coelho spokesman david dreyer said the report was given friday 
to the house ethics committee which routinely reviews house 
financial reporting compliance he said the amended financial 
disclosure was to be filed monday 
there is no indication whether the ethics committee is 
considering or plans to review the bond purchase 
coelho insisted in his statement that the deal was proper but 
said he regretted it 
the report shows that although my purchase of the bonds was 
lawful appropriately financed and that no questions about gifts 
can be fairly raised my 1986 financial disclosure form was 
incomplete and contained some reporting errors coelho said 
i am accepting without reservations the conclusion of my legal 
counsel that the purchase of the bonds was totally above board 
he said 
public officials are today however living in a period of 
intense questioning with the benefit of hindsight i now 
regret having made this transaction 
coelho who has ambitions of climbing higher in the house 
leadership last year put all of his holdings into a blind trust 
my greatest regret is not having gotten into the blind trust 
sooner he said sunday 
dreyer said the congressmans staff had spent a month to 
understand fully and reconstruct this transaction instead of 
releasing details piecemeal he said the effort did not include 
checking whether spiegel had any interest in legislation because 
that is only an issue if spiegel had conferred a gift 
we dont think its going to end up as a big deal he said 
of the transaction

concerns over radiation poisoning

scott camp announced last month it would permanently close the 
retreat near the federal governments fernald uranium plant 
residents of the area surrounding the camp have filed a 300 
million classaction lawsuit against the former operators of the 
plant contending they allowed radioactive dust to contaminate 
local land water and air for three decades

years measuring the amount of radiation were too low it is 
revising them

and provided recreation for more than 150000 campers over the 
years

marine colonel and national security council staffer guilty of 
three felony counts and acquitted him of nine others

alienated from the other jurors 
a lot of times i would come back to my hotel room shut the

important and we had some good conversations and good 
arguments 
she said the jurors saw north as a scapegoat who followed the 
orders of his bosses she admitted she was concerned about the 
stiff sentence north faces including 10 years in jail and 750000

israels coalition cabinet on sunday overcame 
deep divisions and endorsed prime minister yitzhak shamirs 
20point plan for elections in the occupied west bank and gaza 
strip 
the plan passed by a 206 vote after an intense sevenhour 
debate 
it calls for palestinians to elect representatives to negotiate 
on a plan for eventual selfrule but specifically rules out 
negotiations with the palestine liberation organization and says 
israel will oppose creation of a palestinian state 
many palestinian leaders rejected the plan 
plo spokesman ahmed abdulrahman said in tunis tunisia that 
the plo executive committee would meet and then we may have a 
response to the plan the plo leadership must look over the main 
points before we will have any comment 
shamir spokesman avi pazner called the vote a great victory 
for the 73yearold premier it is the first time the likud and 
labor have been able to unite behind one plan pazner told the 
associated press 
observers suggested one reason for the positive vote by the 
fractious coalition was that the plan sidestepped controversial 
issues such as palestinian demands for international supervision 
of elections and for the participation of the 140000 arabs in east 
jerusalem 
another shamir spokesman yossi ahimeir said approval of the 
knesset the israeli parliament was not necessary for the plan 
the likudlabor coalition has a majority in the knesset 
pazner said the key question is whether an arab partner could be 
found for negotiations he said this would be the focus of us 
state department envoy dennis ross forthcoming trip to egypt and 
jordan shamir briefed ross for 45 minutes after the cabinet 
session 
pazner said ross would return to israel tuesday and confer with 
shamir on arab reactions 
most prominent palestinians reacted negatively to the plan 
although shamir picked up support from bethlehem mayor elias freij 
freij considered a moderate told israels arabic tv that 
shamirs plan is a worthy idea if it is fairly conducted under 
international supervision with the consent of the plo and the 
participation of the residents of east jerusalem 
the plan calls for elections in the west bank and gaza strip 
with candidates chosen from districts those elected would 
negotiate selfrule for the 17 million palestinian residents of 
the territories 
israel radio said that under the plan the occupied territories 
would be divided into 10 districts with each district represented 
by one person in the elected body 
after three years talks would start on a permanent settlement 
of the israelipalestinian dispute with the same local negotiators 
playing a central role the settlement would be in the context 
of a treaty between jordan and israel 
ziad abu ziad a leading palestinian criticized the plan 
because it called for a treaty with jordan not with palestinians 
five prominent palestinians sent a letter to us consulgeneral 
phillip wilcox opposing the plan we find the shamir proposal 
grossly deficient in as much as it is not part of a political 
process that leads clearly to the establishment of an independent 
palestinian state they wrote 
the democratic front for the liberation of palestine a 
hardline faction of the plo called the plan a false 
enterprise aimed at undermining the palestinian uprising and 
plans for an international middle east peace conference 
defense minister yitzhak rabin a leader of the leftleaning 
labor party and author of key elements of the plan said the 
cabinet vote meant that after a long period of paralysis israel 
had a serious and practical plan 
communications minister gad yacobi also of labor said i 
think the palestinians would be crazy not to accept the possibility 
of electing representatives a delegation to talk to israel about 
their own future 
the daily yediot ahronot said shamir believed elections could be 
held within one year while rabin estimated six months were needed 
industry minister ariel sharon led rightwing opposition to the 
proposal arguing it would intensify the palestinian uprising 
divide jerusalem and lead to creation of a palestinian state 
this plan carries a clear recipe for more violence more 
terrorism and even a danger of war he said on israel army radio 
at least 474 palestinians have died in the 17month palestinian 
uprising against israeli occupation of the west bank and gaza 
strip twentyone israelis have died 
two palestinians accused of collaborating with israeli officials 
were found dead sunday and arab hospital reports said israeli 
soldiers wounded at least 22 arabs including a 10yearold boy hit 
with a plastic bullet

arm bands and established a firstaid squad 
the first symptoms will be headache said one young man who 
like many others feared to give his name because of possible 
reprisal he and his colleagues set up shop amid boxes containing 
aspirin packets of chinese medicines and bottles of glucose 
well be needed they predicted early in the first full day 
of the hunger strike and they were as a strong sun blazed down on 
the square the firstaid team moved among their fellow students and 
handed out pills 
if they fall down fainting and they are in real danger well 
send them out said one member but if someone insists on 
persisting and wont go we have to accept it

what some people call gorbachev fever has yet 
to invade china but the chinese media and public are praising the 
soviet leader in connection with this weeks summit 
we hope our leaders will learn from him said a middleaged 
man who lauded president mikhail s gorbachevs policy of glasnost 
or openness 
the soviets even had election protests the man said we 
havent come that far 
the summit symbolizes the end of a 30year rift between the two 
communist giants 
the chinese government however has maintained a lowkey 
attitude toward the historic meeting it appears determined to 
assure western countries that china has no intention of restoring 
the close ties it had with the soviets in the 1950s 
in the week leading up to the summit staterun newspapers began 
publishing a few articles on the soviet union and on gorbachev and 
his wife raisa but little was said of the summit 
the peoples daily the communist party newspaper carried a 
glowing profile of mrs gorbachev on sunday writing of her beauty 
intelligence and vivacious personality 
national television broadcast a program sunday night on 
gorbachev and his family but on the national evening news 
gorbachevs departure from moscow followed reports on a steel 
conference and a student hunger strike at beijings tiananmen 
square 
despite the lack of coverage beijing residents are aware of the 
summit and the soviet leaders experiments in allowing greater 
political and cultural debate 
demonstrating students who are demanding a free press and 
greater political freedom view gorbachevs reforms with special 
interest 
about 6000 students signed a letter delivered saturday to the 
soviet embassy inviting gorbachev to speak to them at beijing 
university the embassy said it would deliver the letter to 
gorbachev but his schedule during the threeday beijing visit is 
tight 
qinghua university students at the tiananmen square protest 
referred to the soviet union and some east european countries as 
examples of a worldwide trend toward democratization they said 
china will be affected 
the mainstream is moving toward economic liberalization and 
political democratization they declared in a manifesto read at 
the square the peoples congress of the soviet union has 
realized a relatively high level of democracy compared to other 
socialist countries 
there seems to be little public animosity or suspicion toward 
the country that the official chinese media lashed for many years 
as a warmongering territory grabber 
if they demobilize some of the troops from their border and we 
demobilize some of ours well reduce the burden of military 
spending said a young man on a bicycle 
of course in foreign relations two countries always use each 
other dont they he addeds im sure were willing to use the 
soviets if we can

involving a powersharing junta 
however he rejected the ideanothing doing no playing with 
the popular will of the people he declared 
the only solution begins with recognition of the may 7 
election nothing more nothing less he said 
the opposition has said it will negotiate only with the 
military because it does not recognize the current government it 
has said noriega can join talks but only with the understanding 
that any agreement will call for him to leave

remained hospitalized recovering from injuries sustained when he 
arias calderon and ford were beaten by noriega supporters wednesday

broadcast 
mcgrath did not appear at the service as he usually does but 
the letter was read by a lay person mcgrath was celebrating mass 
at an undisclosed location a spokeswoman for the church said 
church support for fair elections is a new factor in the 
political equation here where the church has not been as 
influential as it is in nicaragua or el salvador 
noriega has been indicted for drug trafficking in the united 
states which has been trying to remove him for more than a year 
wednesdays general strike is to coincide with a meeting of the 
organization of american states in washington to discuss the

for toughness that has earned her the nickname iron lady 
im driven to be confrontational she told vanity fair i 
have had to learn to be combative to get it across of course when 
youre a woman and youre combative they say youre an iron lady 
let me tell you if you hadnt got a spine which was strong and 
firm and a will which was strong and firm we would never have got

hundreds of trucks on sunday rumbled 
along a dirt road built to bypass a section of the major supply 
route to the capital that is frequently cut by anticommunist 
rebels 
the 18mile detour runs across flat planes unlike the main 
salang highway that weaves through the mountains between kabul and 
the soviet border 260 miles away 
soldiers stationed at a checkpoint on the outskirts of kabul 
said the new road was opened wednesday and it has been used by more 
than 1000 privately operated trucks they said about 200 trucks 
reached kabul sunday 
there are government checkpoints every 15 miles along the 
detour according to the soldiers 
guerrillas in the mountains north of kabul often attacked 
convoys on the salang highway causing a shortage of food fuel and 
other essential supplies in the capital 
the government controls this road said one driver 
42yearold ghulabb as his truck passed through the checkpoint to 
enter kabul the truck was hauling three cars and auto parts with 
firewood bags of rice and cans of gasoline piled on top 
ghulabb who uses only one name said he left the soviet border 
friday and made the journey to kabul in two days 
but finding drivers to make the hazardous trip is difficult and 
owners must pay high wages to ge supplies delivered 
ghulabb said he earns the equivalent of about 500 per month 
which is more than double the average annual income in afghanistan 
ghulabb the father of five children said he does not worry 
about getting caught in the crossfire between rebels and government 
troops 
ive been driving for 16 years and havent been fired on 
yet he said someone controls the road and someone wants to 
use the road and its how you make your deal 
when the rebels intensified their attacks on the salang highway 
in january the soviet union began an airlift to kabul to overcome 
severe shortages 
the airlift is continuing with as many as 50 military transport 
planes flying into kabul daily with food fuel weapons and 
ammunition 
the soviet union sent military personnel into afghanistan in 
december 1978 to help the marxist government battle the rebels and 
for several years had more than 100000 soldiers in the country 
the soviets agreed to withdraw under an afghanpakistani 
agreement and soviet officials said all of their soldiers had left 
the country by feb 15

a 28yearold button collector says he was kicked 
off an eastern airlines jet after he put on a bust lorenzo hat 
but airport officials say he was arrested for criminal trespass 
atlanta police lt eugene bell said john zaubler 28 of new 
york was arrested on the misdemeanor charge following the incident 
thursday and later released on bond 
mark coates a supervisor with airport operations at hartsfield 
atlanta international airport said zaubler was arrested after he 
refused to sit in his assigned seat on the eastern flight from new 
york to florida 
coates said eastern personnel asked him to sit in the seat and 
he didnt want to sit there then he refused to leave the 
airplane 
eastern officials called the police who arrested zaubler coates 
said 
coates said he did not believe the incident was related to the 
ongoing strike against eastern airlines which has been 
characterized by bitter disputes between union workers and frank 
lorenzo chairman of easterns parent texas air corp 
zaubler however gave a different version of events in an 
interview sunday in new york city 
zaubler said he had gotten off the jet during a layover in 
atlanta at the airport terminal zaubler saw pickets with bust 
lorenzo buttons and as a collector of about 50000 political 
buttons he asked for and was given one then he said he paid a 
picket 5 for a bust lorenzo cap 
zaubler a real estate executive said he wore the button and 
cap into the eastern terminal and finally took them off after 
repeated objections from eastern personnel 
when he got back on the plane he said someone was sitting in 
his seat and some passengers had taken his three bags from the 
overhead compartment and were going through his possessions 
he said eastern ticket agents on the plane refused to help him 
and ordered him to sit somewhere else telling him the flight now 
had open seating so the seat assignment on his boarding pass from 
new york no longer was valid 
i put the lorenzo cap back on for 15 seconds he said 
at that point he said one of the ticket agents told him 
thats it youre off the plane 
zaubler who described himself as a conservative republican who 
thinks ill of unions and has tremendous respect for frank 
lorenzo said he apologized but was taken off the plane by police 
officers and arrested

young survivors of a bus crash that left 24 
children and three adults dead helped unveil a black granite 
monument on mothers day the first anniversary of the fiery 
tragedy 
the rev w don tennison whose radcliff first assembly of god 
church owned the bus prayed for an end to drunken driving and for 
the passage of laws to make it too costly to get into an 
automobile drunk 
the aging school bus was carrying 67 passengers home from a 
cincinnati amusement park on may 14 1988 when it was hit by a 
pickup truck going the wrong way on interstate 71 near carrollton 
about 100 miles northeast of here it was the nations worst 
alcoholrelated highway accident and one of the worst bus crashes 
in us history 
the truck driver larry mahoney of owen county will be tried in 
november on 27 counts of murder and one count of driving while 
intoxicated 
the monument raised triangular slabs sloping away from a 
benchlike centerpiece stands in north hardin memorial gardens 
where many of the victims are buried it bears the names of the 27 
dead and the 40 survivors as well as the emblem of mothers 
against drunk driving 
we felt a positive statement must be made said roy keith 
owner of the company that built the monument the idea was for a 
memorial that would remind viewers of the terrible blight of 
drunken drivers he said at the ceremony 
the monument was unveiled by survivors aaron conyers 16 carey 
aurentz 15 katrina muller 14 and harold dennis 15 as well as 
sons of two of the adults who died john robert pearman jr whose 
father drove the bus and charles j kytta iii whose father was 
the churchs youth minister 
the rev gene waggoner pastor of stithton baptist church in 
this northern kentucky city of about 14000 people prayed for 
inner peace for those mourning the victims but said we have 
every reason to be bitter 
kentuckys top state highway official said the government was 
trying to ensure that the tragedy will not be repeated 
kentucky transportation secretary milo d bryant renewed his 
criticism of the state school boards refusal 11 days earlier to 
require more stringent training of school bus drivers 
that was a recommendation of a bussafety task force appointed 
by gov wallace wilkinson and chaired by bryant the school board 
balked because the state did not provide the 250000 the panel 
estimated would be the cost of the extra training 
i say that you cannot put a price on the safety of our 
children said bryant who did not mention the board by name 
bryant said he would fight to have another emergency door 
on the left side of all new school buses a move also opposed by 
the state department of education 
the dedication was to be followed by two other ceremonies 
members of a survivingfamily support group planned a community 
appreciation service in the gymnasium of nearby north hardin high 
school which overlooks the cemetery 
that was to be followed by a public prayer and memorial service 
in the football stadium behind the high school

teachers cast aside any chances for a 
lastminute resolution of their lengthy labor dispute with the 
school district and spent sunday readying picket signs and rallying 
the troops 
weve got our people all across the district making phone 
calls to their teachers telling them to be ready for the picket 
line said catherine carey spokeswoman for united teacherslos 
angeles 
board of education president roberta weintraub said the district 
would make no lastditch contract offer 
despite the consensus that a strike was imminent ms weintraub 
said she expected teachers to back down and settle before the 
midnight strike deadline 
the reality of the offer which is one of the best in the 
nation quite frankly is what makes me optimistic ms 
weintraub said with the variety of things we see on the table 
it is very unusual to have a strike 
the walkout was set to begin monday with hastily hired 
substitutes crossing picket lines to teach the districts nearly 
600000 students 
with five weeks remaining before summer vacation the strike 
threatened to create havoc with students final grades but 
teachers stood by their demands for higher pay and more say in how 
schools are run 
we have not received any indication from the school district 
that they want to come to the bargaining table ms carey said 
teachers have been adamant in their demand for a twoyear 
contract with a 21 percent pay hike they also want elimination of 
unpaid nonteaching duties like school yard supervision and 
afterschool meetings and more influence in how their schools are 
run an issue known as teacher governance 
the district has offered teachers a 215 percent pay raise 
spread over three years and a teacher governance plan that union 
leaders have dismissed as tilted in favor of administrators 
no formal bargaining talks took place during the weekend union 
and district officials talked informally but were unable to arrange 
any formal resumption of negotiations leading to gloomy 
predictions about any hope of settling the dispute 
it looks like its going to happen said pat spencer 
spokesman for the los angeles unified school district we have 
been preparing and planning for this for two months 
the district conducted mass hirings of substitutes as teachers 
marched outside recruiting centers carrying picket signs bearing 
messages such as this is no way to begin a teaching career 
hundreds of people responded to the districts call for 
emergency substitutes but the number fell far short of 
replacements needed for the thousands of teachers expected to 
strike 
ms weintraub warned teachers that their benefits would lapse 
monday if they strike unless they paid 27083 a month from their 
own pockets 
los angeles unified school district with about 800 schools 
serving 594000 students is second only in size to new york city 
and hasnt been struck by teachers since a 23day walkout in 1970 
united teacherslos angeles which represents about 22000 of 
the districts 32000 teachers nurses and counselors has been 
locked in the contract battle with the district for more than a 
year 
state and local elected officials stayed out of the dispute 
until last week when senate president pro tem david roberti dlos 
angeles said the district would get at least 34 million and 
possibly as much as 60 million in new revenue that could be used 
for higher teacher salaries 
but district officials refused to raise their offer based solely 
on projections of funds that might be received 
in march teachers overwhelmingly rejected a 20percent pay 
raise over three years effectively stalling negotiations despite 
the efforts of a state mediator 
teachers salaries start at 23440 and can go as high as 43319 
administrators salaries range from 37000 to 95600 district 
superintendent leonard britton who has been criticized by union 
leaders for his perceived hardline attitude receives an annual 
salary of 141000

shakespearean actors took to a makeshift stage 
sunday in a bid to block construction of an office building at the 
site of a 16th century theater where the bard himself once 
performed 
the players entertained a rally that attracted hundreds of 
supporters to the remains of the rose theater on the south bank of 
the river thames 
its like the greeks knocking down the parthenon to make a car 
park sir peter hall former director of the national theater 
said at the rally 
i do not believe any other country at this moment in the world 
would do this and its a terrifying example of a situation in 
our country where cash is more important than the soul of the 
country itself he said 
on the makeshift stage a few yards from the rose members of the 
royal shakespeare company read from william shakespeares henry 
vi which they now are performing in london 
shakespeare is thought to have acted in henry vi at the 
rose his early plays were staged there 
bulldozers were scheduled to begin work on an office building at 
the site monday morning construction has been postponed for five 
months since the remains of the theater were found 
archaeologists pressed ahead with their excavation sunday and 
protesters declared they would conduct an allnight vigil

one with pragmatic marketoriented economic policies 
living standards have improved for millions of chinese but the 
modernization drive has led to serious problems of inflation and 
corruption

diplomacy must be used if panamanian leader 
gen manuel antonio noriega is to be removed from power defense 
secretary dick cheney said sunday 
cheney adopting a moderate tone a day after president bush 
urged the panamanian people to drive noriega from power said 
support from other south american leaders would help the 
administrations efforts to encourage the generals departure 
i think whatever you do is going to have to be done 
diplomatically the former wyoming congressman said at 
commencement exercises at the university of wyoming 
it would help if the other latin american nations would come 
together and make it clear that they wont deal with a panamanian 
government headed by mr noriega 
the organization of american states will meet next week if 
they take a tough strong position and join in supporting for 
example the us economic sanctions those kinds of things might 
conceivably ultimately result in his departure he said 
cheney praised bush for his decision to send us troops to 
panama in the wake of noriegas efforts to nullify the results of 
an election in which the generals handpicked candidates were 
defeated 
i think it was a necessary move it was a step that a prudent 
man would take he said weve got some 40000 americans who 
live in panama weve got major obligations under the panama 
canal treaty 
hopefully the situation will be resolved peaceably mr 
noriega should obviously step down and let the people of panama 
prevail in terms of the election he said 
cheney said the united states would like to avoid violence but 
added that the country has a commitment to protect the panama canal 
under the treaty 
that commitment runs to the end of the century and the 
president as commanderinchief has an obligation to carry out 
the treaty responsibilities and also to safeguard american lives 
he said i think it is important that noriega understand that we 
are there specifically to see to it that we enforce our rights 
under the treaty 
cheney who was honored as a distinguished alumni of the 
university also said he hopes congress will increase defense 
spending in the future 
everybody has this myth in mind that somehow we had this 
massive arms buildup in the 1980s and its been growing year by 
year he said it did grow in the early 1980s but its been 
stable to downhill ever since if you keep cutting the defense 
budget well end up sooner or later with less military 
capability

young survivors of a bus crash that left 24 
children and three adults dead helped unveil a black granite 
monument sunday one of three ceremonies marking the first 
anniversary of the fiery tragedy 
in some ways today is worse than others its the first 
anniversary combined with mothers day of all things rev david 
a seamands of asbury theological seminary told a televised 
community memorial service 
more than 1000 people attended the service at north hardin high 
schools football stadium which overlooks the cemetery where many 
of the victims of the may 14 1988 accident are buried 
about the same number of people attended the first service 
dedicating the monument at the cemetery as well as the second 
ceremony at the high school to thank those who helped victims 
families through the past year 
the aging school bus was carrying 67 passengers home when it was 
hit by a pickup truck going the wrong way on interstate 71 near 
carrolton about 100 miles northeast of here it was the nations 
worst alcoholrelated highway accident and one of the worst bus 
crashes in us history 
the truck driver larry mahoney of owen county will be tried in 
november on 27 counts of murder and one count of driving while 
intoxicated 
at the football stadium sunday the rev w don tennison whose 
radcliff first assembly of god church owned the bus read the names 
of the 27 victims whose lives were cut short so suddenly by a 
drunk driver 
as each name was called a family member placed a yellow rose on 
one of 27 wreaths of yellow carnations gov wallace wilkinson and 
his wife martha then placed roses on a larger wreath of yellow 
roses and white carnations 
wilkinson promised to take any action necessary to prevent a 
recurrence where stronger penalties are needed then stronger 
penalties we will impose he said 
tennison pleaded for all to refrain from drinking and driving 
president bush who attended a republican fundraiser the night 
before in woodford county nearly 70 miles to the east declined an 
invitation to attend the service but sent a lengthy telegram which 
was read aloud 
the telegram called drunken driving a national tragedy and 
said laws against drunken driving must be strictly enforced 
the monument dedicated in north hardin memorial gardens consists 
of raised triangular slabs sloping away from a benchlike 
centerpiece it bears the names of the 27 dead and 40 survivors 
as well as the emblem of mothers against drunk driving 
we felt a positive statement must be made said roy keith 
owner of the company that built the monument the idea was for a 
memorial that would remind viewers of the terrible blight of 
drunken drivers he said at the ceremony 
the monument was unveiled by survivors aaron conyers 16 carey 
aurentz 15 katrina muller 14 and harold dennis 15 as well as 
sons of two of the adults who died john robert pearman jr whose 
father drove the bus and charles j kytta iii whose father was 
the churchs youth minister 
the rev gene waggoner pastor of stithton baptist church in 
this northern kentucky city of about 14000 people prayed for 
inner peace for those mourning the victims but said we have 
every reason to be bitter 
kentuckys top state highway official said the government was 
trying to ensure that the tragedy will not be repeated 
kentucky transportation secretary milo d bryant renewed his 
criticism of the state school boards refusal 11 days earlier to 
require more stringent training of school bus drivers 
that was a recommendation of a bussafety task force appointed 
by gov wallace wilkinson and chaired by bryant the school board 
balked because the state did not provide the 250000 the panel 
estimated would be the cost of the extra training 
i say that you cannot put a price on the safety of our 
children said bryant who did not mention the board by name 
bryant said he would fight to have another emergency door 
on the left side of all new school buses a move also opposed by 
the state department of education

the solar calendar is 365 days long the lunar 
calendar 354 but only in detroit can you have a year 638 days 
long or 371 days starting the day after christmas 
for a range of reasons automakers create their own calendars 
and call them model years its may 1989 look how many 
advertisements are on the air and in print pushing 1990 model cars 
now in dealer showrooms 
to outsiders just when a model year starts is anybodys guess 
technically automakers open their books on a model year on oct 1 
and close it the following sept 30 all during that time new cars 
and trucks are rolling off assembly lines and into showrooms 
ford motor co recently has tilted toward introducing cars on 
the day after christmas ford started that in 1985 with the 
taurussable and did it most recently with new cougars and 
thunderbirds 
what about the chevy that replaces the general motors corp 
divisions celebrity line right now its possible for a newcar 
buyer to pick up an 89 celebrity or the car that replaces it a 
90 lumina at the same dealership on the same day a few new 88 
celebrities are still around too 
gm spokeswoman ruth bouldes said marketing was the driving force 
behind introducing lumina in april 
the spring market is the most important market for the 
calendar year she said the lumina should be available for 638 
days figuring that the car will be around on dec 31 1990 
marketing is just one factor in decisions on when to introduce a 
car others involve retooling factories for the new model and 
working out unforeseen problems 
all the preplanning in the world cant take care of things 
that need to be done to coincide with a date that was established 
years before said ford spokesman dave krupp with the growing 
concern for satisfied customers it just doesnt make sense to put 
a car in the marketplace if we are not certain it was ready 
the government pretty much steers clear of model years 
passive restraint regulations which call for automatic seat 
belts and air bags for instance are keyed to date of the 
vehicles manufacture said national highway transportation safety 
administration spokesman tim hurd 
it doesnt matter what the manufacturer calls it hurd said 
at the environmental protection agency which governs fuel 
economy and emissions the law reads 
the term model year with reference to any specific calendar 
year means a manufacturers annual production period as 
determined by the epa administrator which includes jan 1 of such 
calendar year if a manufacturer has no annual production period 
the term model year means the calendar year 
volkswagen united states inc a subsidiary of the west german 
automaker has still another interpretation it markets wolfsburg 
limited editions cars to test consumer reaction to new colors and 
options 
that annual practice started with a car officially christened a

even though the trading board for high 
fructose corn syrup futures at the minneapolis grain exchange has 
been without a regular pulse for nearly two years the originator 
refuses to declare it dead 
occasionally there is a seller and occasionally there is a 
buyer but it seems that never the two can meet said richard 
rhodie who led the exchanges effort to become the worlds only 
licensed hub for the trading of high fructose corn syrup futures 
contracts 
after a sweet debut in the spring of 1987 the giant millers and 
prolific soda pop bottlers who were expected to feed off the market 
departed with a sour taste to their dismay they discovered in july 
of that year that shipping routes for the sugar substitute included 
stops not authorized by quality control experts at pepsi and 
cocacola bottlers rhodie said 
handling the raw material had not been contemplated by many of 
the traders but a group of sellers suddenly exercised their right 
to make deliveries rhodie said one contract buys 48000 pounds of 
the corn syrup the equivalent of a tank truck 
a sudden liquidation of contracts occurred and trading slammed 
to a halt the shipping snafu has been corrected rhodie said but 
trading never recovered months go by without a trade leaving 
players with no assurances that they can buy and sell as they need 
the fact is obvious that it isnt trading well said james 
lindau president of the exchange its safe to say that it 
hasnt made any money for the grain exchange 
rhodie thought he had a natural when he picked high fructose 
corn syrup as a diversification tool for the commodity exchange 
the industry includes big suppliers like ae staley archer 
daniels midland and cargill inc who are used to futures markets 
and there is a booming demand for the product 
an estimated 14 billion pounds of the material is consumed every 
year as an ingredient in soda pop and baked goods rhodie said it 
has a consistency and taste that make it an increasingly attractive 
substitute for granular sugar rhodie said 
more important its price is low ranging from eight or nine 
cents a pound up to 26 cents a pound 
rhodie said he envisioned more than 100 contracts a day changing 
hands bottlers he thought would be driven to lock in the 
cost of their most expensive ingredient to ensure profitability in 
longrange marketing plans 
for instance a bottler could buy a contract to set the cost at 
17 cents a pound for syrup needed three months later 
if the price drops below 17 cents a pound in three months the 
bottler still makes a profit on the sale of the pop if the price 
increases the bottler makes an additional gain on the sale of the 
futures contract 
the market is there if they want to use it he said right 
now theyre just living within the traditional constraints of their 
business they pay cash for the product if they guess right 
theyre lucky 
the highest volume ever recorded on the exchange was 286 
contracts on may 20 1987 rhodie said but volume was dismal in 
the second half of 1987 and 1988 was miserable rhodie could name 
only a few dates in 1988 when more than 10 contracts traded hands 
and activity this year has been nil 
its unfortunate but you know you do your best and you hope 
it works rhodie said i guess i cant take it personally 
lindau said there has been no talk of discontinuing the futures 
market like rhodie lindau said another drought or other 
significant event could jar a response from the industry 
there is still scattered interest rhodie said but 
everybodys still on the sidelines and saying ill trade it if 
you trade it
