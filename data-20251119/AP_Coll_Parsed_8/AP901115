men with clogged heart arteries and mild chest 
pain can be safely treated with medicines alone and bypass surgery 
does not help them live any longer a 10year study concludes 
the study released wednesday shows that doctors need not rush 
to perform this common form of surgery to save the lives of those 
with relatively nonsevere disease 
the results are part of the coronary artery surgery study an 
experiment in which 780 people with chest pain and clogged arteries 
were randomly assigned to get bypass surgery or drug treatment 
bypass surgery has long been used to relieve angina the chest 
pain that results when the arteries that feed the heart become 
plugged with fatty buildups surgeons use pieces of vein or artery 
to reroute blood around the clogged sections 
at the time the study began in the mid1970s doctors wondered 
whether the surgery would improve the outlook of people with bad 
arteries who had only mild pain 
the first data from the study released five years ago showed 
that people treated with drugs lived just as long as those getting 
bypass and the latest data shows that there is no longerterm 
advantage to bypass in these people either 
its remarkable that there was no difference in total 
survivorship of these patients after 10 years said dr lawrence 
s cohen of yale university a coauthor of the study about 80 
percent of both groups were still alive 
despite their heart disease these peoples hearts beat 
normally the study showed that bypass does improve lifespan for 
those angina victims whose hearts pumping power has been weakened 
by heart attacks 
the results were released at the annual scientific meeting of 
the american heart association 
its fair to say it is not necessary to have an intense 
movement to surgery people can watch patients and make judgments 
based on a variety of factors commented dr william b kannel a 
founder of the longrunning framingham heart study in suburban 
boston 
bypass is one of the most common forms of major surgery in the 
united states an estimated 353000 of the operations were 
performed in 1988 
since the study began the treatment of angina has changed 
considerably doctors now have a new class of drugs called calcium 
channel blockers as well as another way of improving the hearts 
blood flow a procedure called angioplasty in this common 
treatment doctors use balloons to squeeze open the clogged 
arteries 
angioplasty is less expensive and far easier to recover from 
than bypass new studies are under way to see how the two kinds of 
therapy compare over time 
the new options have given doctors the opportunity to try less 
drastic ways of controlling chest pain and reserving bypass surgery 
for when these approaches fail 
most cardiologist would agree that it is possible to control 
the symptoms of the vast majority of angina patients medically 
said kannel

bernardo bertolucci admits putting his cast and 
crew through an ordeal to make the sheltering sky a film about 
an american couple seeking to revive their marriage deep in the 
sahara 
the film was to have a gala premiere tonight at the yearold 
operabastille 
based on paul bowles bestselling novel by the same name the 
film stars debra winger and john malkovich as kit and port moresby 
sophisticated new york artists who go into the african desert to 
save their failing marriage 
it is due to open in the united states in middecember 
bertolucci told reporters after an advance screening wednesday 
that the cast and crew of 120 battled desert heat and flooding 
caused by the first rains in the region in two years 
the storms swept away roads and bridges stranding equipment 
trucks the cast crew and even bertolucci himself 
it was a hard movie to make the sweat isnt makeup its real 
sweat he said the dust is real dust and the flies are real 
flies 
ms winger said filming on location in the desert added a 
special quality to the movie 
i had always felt a pull to the desert whether in south 
western united states or the negev ms winger said but the 
sahara was really something different it was much rougher than i 
expected 
she said she was unable to return to the united states when 
filming ended last january instead she put a pack on her back and 
traveled through niger for three weeks 
only then could i face coming home i had the desert inside of 
me she said 
bertolucci said he was attracted to the sheltering sky 
which became something of a cult book when published in 1949 
because after the last emperor i was really interested in 
doing something that didnt have a lot of actors and a lot of 
costumes 
he cast bowles in a small role in the film 
its exotic locations included the dusty mudbuilt town of 
agadez niger fifty tuareg tribesmen nomads who spend their lives 
in constant search of water and pasturage traveled 3000 miles to 
be cast as extras 
most of them had never seen a camera or automobile and were not 
able to digest the productions butter and mayonnaisesmeared 
sandwiches 
despite the exotic landscape malkovich said the sheltering 
sky involved common themes 
the film is set in a different place in a different time yet 
its a common story of the human condition in terms of the way 
people live he said 
when the book was published bertolucci recalled bowles said 
kit and port were a couple from the future but their malaise is 
something very modern its something i see around me all the 
time 
the film is not about the impossibility of love they love 
each other deeply rather its about the impossibility of finding 
happiness inside a love relationship he said

the andaman sea abut 410 miles southwest of thailands southern 
island of phuket the department said 
it said it had received reports that tremors were felt in 
highrise buildings in phuket and nearby songkhla province as well 
as in bangkok 
the richter scale is a gauge of the energy released by an 
earthquake as measured by the ground motion recorded on a

next monday in a glittering ceremony in 
paris the united states the soviet union and their military 
allies plan to sign the most sweeping agreement in history to 
reduce weapons arsenals 
but the treaty to slash arms across the vast expanse of europe 
from the atlantic ocean to the ural mountains in the soviet union 
is simply not ready 
confident bush administration officials only four days short of 
the deadline expect to have all the details cleared up in time 
and yet they have been flashing the same confidence for months 
and come up short 
some of the unresolved issues are technical and a few are more 
than that for instance officials still have not agreed on how to 
verify that the north atlantic treaty organization and the warsaw 
pact eliminate the tanks antiaircraft artillery and other 
nonnuclear arms they have agreed to junk in the interest of a 
calmer europe 
also not settled is how much the hardpressed soviets will pay 
to melt down tanks and inspect stockpile reductions 
they are up against the wall financially a sympathetic us 
official told the associated press on wednesday i dont see a 
big problem out there 
the official who spoke on condition of anonymity was unable to 
say how the verification issues would be resolved by the time 
president bush soviet president mikhail s gorbachev and the 
leaders of the 15 other nato and five other warsaw pact nations 
sign the conventional forces in europe agreement 
last week secretary of state james a baker iii left his senior 
arms control experts behind in moscow when he could not crack the 
final issues with soviet foreign minister eduard a shevardnadze 
those experts managed to clear up differences over the aircraft 
to be eliminated 
but verification problems still hang over the paris ceremony 
also even though baker worked out with shevardnadze new figures 
for the number of tanks and other nonnuclear weapons to be left on 
the flanks of europe the terms still must be ratified by turkey 
and norway 
the lastminute shift in weapons quotas for the outermost of the 
four european zones is based on a reduction of tensions in germany 
once considered the likeliest flashpoint the region now is 
basically serene east germany the staunchest soviet ally has 
merged with west germany 
the soviets meanwhile gave way to pressure from their own 
allies last week and agreed they could have larger quotas of the 
arms permitted the warsaw pact under the treaty 
the differences are minor for instance the soviets now will 
have 13150 tanks instead of 13300 
this pleases the bush administration because it considers 
hungary czechoslovakia poland bulgaria and romania unlikely to 
fight alongside the soviets in the nowremote possibility of war 
us officials are remarkably serene in their confidence the 
treaty will be ready by monday basically its buttoned up its 
going to be signed an official said 
also due for signing by the members of the two alliances is a 
nonaggression declaration it will in a sense bury the cold 
war hatchet baker said at a white house news conference 
wednesday 
far from complete meanwhile is another treaty that was 
destined for signing at a ussoviet summit in moscow next month 
that one would reduce the two superpowers longrange nuclear 
bombers missiles and submarines by about 30 percent 
bush had hoped to sign the accord with gorbachev but there 
seems to be no hope remaining for an accord by years end 
baker and shevardnadze and their arms control experts have 
been unable to resolve three major issues 
they are 
the kinds of testing and other restrictions to impose on the 
154 heavy groundbased ss18 intercontinental ballistic missiles 
the soviet will retain under the strategic arms reduction treaty 
whether the soviet backfire bomber is to be classified as a 
strategic weapon as the united states demands that would mean 
counting backfires against numerical weapons limits established in 
the treaty 
the restrictions to be imposed on us and soviet transfers of 
weapons barred under the treaty to allies this issue primarily 
concerns arms washington would like to turn over to britain outside 
the treatys limits

to celebrate the 300th anniversary of 
newspaper journalism in america historians took a look at this 
countrys first newspapers and found them to be bad role models 
elitist racist venomous biased and worshipful of kings 
outrageously partisan is how david paul nord associate 
professor of journalism at indiana university characterized them 
at a daylong discussion on the roots of the american press 
wednesday 
and troublemaking when the people of this continent looked for 
treason sedition fragmentation dissension disintegration 
degeneration disunion anarchy or chaos he said they usually 
saw it first in the newspaper 
he said the new york evening post forerunner of todays new 
york post was founded in 1801 by alexander hamiltons faction of 
the federalist party for a single purpose to destroy thomas 
jefferson who won the presidency in the election of 1800 
if that purpose required the editor to vilify his partys 
opponents as liars and traitors to attack the president as a moral 
degenerate with a slave harem or to shoot a republican dead in the 
street in a duel so be it said nord that was what newspaper 
work was all about in 1801 
moreover said historian charles e clark of the university of 
new hampshire the earliest newspapers written for the elite by 
elitists shared some assumptions that were far from democratic 
they believed he said in the superiority of the white race 
over the colored races of the english over other nationalities 
especially the french of protestantism over catholicism in 
capital punishment and in male governance of the family as 
necessary for effective social order and they adored the 
king 
the session for scholars and journalists was sponsored by the 
gannett foundation and the american antiquarian society to 
commemorate the appearance of the first american newspaper 
publick occurrences both forreign and domestick 
it was issued in boston by printer benjamin harris on sept 25 
1690 eight decades before the american revolution 
publick occurrences promised to come out once a month or if 
any glut of occurrences happen oftener but didnt live up to 
the promise issue no 1 was the last the authorities of 
massachusetts colony suppressed it as unlicnsed printed without 
the least privity or countenance of authority 
whats more they said it contained sundry doubtful and 
uncertain reports no more newspapers were published here until 
1704 
for all the early press weaknesses two contemporary 
journalists author patricia obrien former political 
correspondent for knightridder newspapers and les payne 
assistant managing editor at newsday found some useful linkages 
between early and contemporary journalism 
ms obrien said benjamin harris could serve as a model because 
of his audacity in printing without government permission in 
the first place and his lack of reliance on official sources a 
lack she said barely exists in washington journalism today 
payne said journalists always have liked to say their mission is 
to comfort the afflicted and afflict the comfortable but it 
isnt necessarily so 
he said newspapers in the 18th century and those published today 
have in common a tendency to comfort the comfortable and ignore 
the afflicted

congressional democrats are counseling 
president bush to give international sanctions against iraq as much 
as 18 months to take effect before considering military moves in 
the persian gulf crisis 
at a white house meeting wednesday house speaker thomas foley 
and others asked bush to be patient foley suggested that the 
economic embargo may take many months longer to force iraq to 
withdraw from kuwait according to a senior congressional source 
afterward house majority leader richard gephardt dmo issued 
a statement calling for a policy of patient strength permitting 
the economic sanctions to work 
but sen bob kerrey dneb said im terribly worried about 
the direction theyre going in the administration 
the sanctions were imposed with broad international support 
following iraqs aug 2 invasion of kuwait they have largely shut 
down commerce in food oil weaponry and other goods 
in separate closeddoor briefings senators and house members 
heard from secretary of state james a baker iii and from defense 
secretary dick cheney but some left with fears the administration 
is edging ever closer to war 
rep david obey who attended the white house meeting said 
im pessimistic about the possibility of avoiding war based on 
the tone of conversation coming from administration officials 
if were going to be the champions of impatience were going 
to send our kids into a lot of bloody battles obey dwis 
added 
sen wendell ford of kentucky the newly elected no 2 
democratic leader in the senate said war would only split america 
apart i think theres no question about it this is not a 
grenada or a panama its a vietnam with sand 
ford added i would prefer to let the sanctions run for a 
year and win without bloodshed 
baker said the sanctions are beginning to bite but asked 
whether they would be enough to force iraqi president saddam 
hussein to withdraw from kuwait he answered i dont think we 
can say that today with certainty 
analysts say iraqs civilian factory production has been sharply 
curtailed and some food shortages are occurring but sanctions have 
been slow to affect the military they point out that iraqis 
having just lived through an eightyear war with iran are used to 
finding substitutes for goods in short supply and making do 
without 
following the briefing by baker and cheney sen jim sasser 
dtenn said the embargo appears to be holding but is taking 
longer than expected to show signs of impact 
the embargo is not a quick solution sasser said my 
counsel is patience that we continue the sanctions with the full 
realization that it may take months perhaps even a period of a 
year or two 
but some republicans balked at such a long commitment saying 
americans would have no patience for leaving troops in place 
through 1991 
that is far beyond the time frame i thought appropriate 
said house republican leader robert michel of illinois such a long 
wait would require shoring up the american publics attitude 
toward the gulf deployment 
senate gop leader bob dole of kansas added if the american 
people are frustrated already after threeplus months what 
are they going to be a year from now 
michel said bush justified his latest military buildup the 
neardoubling of the us force in the gulf region by pointing to 
saddams potential stranglehold on oil and on the economies of many 
nations 
bush told the lawmakers that we havent crossed any particular 
rubicon here with the latest troop deployment michel said 
reading from his notes of the meeting 
this was no petty aggression on the part of saddam hussein 
bush told congressional leaders if we dont take heed now well 
pay dearly later 
the administration and congress also clashed over the 
presidents obligation to seek permission before undertaking any 
offensive military moves lawmakers reiterated their constitutional 
right to declare war baker said bush would follow the 
constitution but pointedly added its a question of what the 
constitution requires 
with house and senate hearings on gulf policy scheduled as early 
as next week the idea of calling congress back into an emergency 
session appeared to have fallen from favor 
meanwhile a nationwide poll of 1020 americans that was 
commissioned by arms control advocates found that most oppose going 
to war with iraq even if the standoff continues early next year 
the poll conducted by icr survey research group of media pa 
said 44 percent favor continuing the sanctions and 14 percent want 
us troops withdrawn from saudi arabia an additional 30 percent 
would choose war but only if allies and the united nations 
approved first and 8 percent chose war even without approval 
the poll financed by the professionals coalition for nuclear 
arms control was conducted friday through tuesday and had a margin 
of error of plus or minus 3 percentage points

when prime minister margaret thatcher set off to a 
european summit in rome last month it looked like business as 
usual another spat with the continentals more maggie isolated 
headlines and home 
but the oct 27 meeting of the european community leaders was 
for mrs thatcher the crest of a slippery slope and provoked the 
most serious challenge to her leadership through 11 years in power 
now mrs thatcher is fighting for her political survival 
former defense secretary michael heseltine announced wednesday 
that he will challenge her on tuesday for the leadership of the 
conservative party and the prime ministership 
things of course had not gone that wrong that quickly for the 
iron lady 
the crisis is a culmination of economic troubles at home and a 
questioning of what was once a major thatcher asset the gritty 
nationalism she calls batting for britain 
mrs thatcher returned from rome in a feisty mood saying the 11 
other leaders were living in cloud cuckoo land for agreeing to 
set up a single currency perhaps by the year 2000 
it is a move she rejects as undermining national sovereignty and 
leading to a federal united states of europe 
no no no she shouted oct 30 in the house of commons 
about proposals for greater political union of the 12nation 
community 
two days later her deputy prime minister sir geoffrey howe 
veteran of more than 30 summit meetings by her side resigned 
he said he could take it no longer 
as thatcher loyalists waited with trepidation for howe to 
elaborate the tories were driven into a humiliating third place in 
a special parliamentary election in the northern city of bradford 
bradford which the tories had held since 1983 was the latest 
in a string of electoral drubbings it came just weeks after the 
conservatives lost a previously safe south england district 
eastbourne 
then on tuesday howe unleashed one of the most scathing attacks 
ever delivered on a british prime minister by a senior colleague 
he accused mrs thatcher of creating a nightmare image of 
britains european partners and said life in her 22member cabinet 
was an intolerable struggle between loyalty to her and to britains 
interests in the european community 
the time has come for others to consider their own response to 
the tragic conflict of loyalties with which i have myself wrestled 
for perhaps too long howe said 
the howe move tipped heseltine into the challenge 
he is the first political heavyweight to run against mrs 
thatcher since she became party leader in 1975 she led the tories 
from opposition to government in 1979 and on to two more election 
victories 
europe was the catalyst 
but when did things really start to go wrong was it last year 
when she sacked howe as foreign secretary leaving him to brood 
with a big title and no apparent job 
or in october 1987 when the government fearful of a postblack 
monday recession sparked a credit boom and set off inflation with 
lower interest rates 
or was it as howe claims mrs thatchers refusal five years 
ago to link the pound to europes other major currencies as a curb 
on inflation 
at the root of the thatcher crisis is the sense that her 
freemarket revolution isnt working any more and disaffection in 
a party facing the prospect of defeat by the revamped labor party 
at the next general election it must be held by mid1992 
inflation the ill mrs thatcher set out to conquer with her 
austere economic policies is at nearly 11 percent while high 
interest rates persist for 16 months the tories have trailed labor 
in polls 
the prime minister is also being blamed for a major voteloser 
a new per capita local government tax known as the poll tax 
which heseltine has promised to review 
heseltine claims more than 100 sure votes from among the 372 
conservative legislators who elect the party leader thatchers 
campaigners say shell roll up the 214 votes needed for an outright 
win on the first ballot and more 
but nobody knows and a second ballot nov 27 would attract more 
contenders possibly from within the cabinet shattering what unity 
is left and deeply wounding mrs thatcher even if she survives

here is the text of this years thanksgiving 
proclamation issued wednesday by president bush 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
in the first presidential thanksgiving day proclamation george 
washington observed that it is the duty of all nations to 
acknowledge the providence of almighty god to obey his will to be 
grateful for his benefits and humbly to implore his protection and 
favor as a people who have long enjoyed unparalleled material 
prosperity and the priceless blessings of peace and freedom we 
americans cannot fail to fulfill this great yet joyous duty 
thus we pause each year on thanksgiving day to express our 
gratitude for the goodness and generosity of our creator and to ask 
his continued protection and guidance in all our endeavors both as 
individuals and as a nation 
the observance of thanksgiving was a cherished tradition in 
america long before george washington called his countrymen to 
the service of that great and glorious being who is the beneficent 
author of all the good that was that is or that will be 
indeed we trade the tradition of giving thanks back to some of the 
earliest settlers in this country not only the pilgrims at 
plymouth but also early colonists at jamestown new amsterdam and 
st augustine with hands clasped in prayer and hearts full of 
gratitude these men and women gave public thanks to god for having 
been sustained through times of hardship and peril 
william bradfords account of the experience of the settlers at 
plymouth colony is not only a moving description of the trials of 
emigration to a wilderness but also captures their profound faith 
and contains a timeless exhortation to succeeding generations 
being thus passed the vast ocean they had now no friends 
to welcome them nor inns to entertain or refresh their 
weatherbeaten bodies no houses or much less towns to repair to 
and for the season it was winter and they that know the winters of 
that country know them to be sharp and violent besides what 
could they see but a hideous and desolate wilderness neither 
could they as it were go to the top of pisgah to view from this 
wilderness a more goodly country to feed their hopes for which way 
soever they turned their eyes save upwards to the heavens they 
could have little solace or content what could now sustain them 
but the spirit of god and his grace they cried to the lord and he 
heard their voice and looked on their adversity let them 
therefore praise the lord because he is good and his mercies 
endure forever 
the historic observance of a day of thanksgiving at plymouth in 
1621 was one of many occasions on which our ancestors paused to 
acknowledge their dependence on the mercy and favor of divine 
providence today on this thanksgiving day likewise observed 
during a season of celebration and harvest we have added cause for 
rejoicing the seeds of democratic thought sown on these shores 
continue to take took around the world in central and eastern 
europe in latin america and elsewhere courageous men and women 
are beginning to reap the blessings of freedom and selfgovernment 
peoples who once suffered under the heavy yoke of totalitarianism 
have begun to claim the liberty to which all are heirs 
our gratitude for the rights and opportunities we enjoy as 
americans may be measured by how carefully we use the preserve 
these gifts as when we cultivate in our children a love of freedom 
and an understanding of the responsibilities that freedom demands 
of us we tend the precious blossom of our liberty when we recall 
the example of our ancestors and strive to ensure that our own 
lives are firmly rooted in faith like our forebears we must 
cherish the values and beliefs that are the foundation of strong 
loving families and caring communities and recognize the importance 
of learning and hard work because these are the wellspring of 
progress and prosperity 
the great freedom and prosperity with which we have been blessed 
is cause for rejoicing and it is equally a responsibility 
indeed scripture tells us that much will be asked of those to whom 
much has been given our errand in the wilderness begun more 
than 350 years ago is not yet complete abroad we are working 
toward a new partnership of nations at home we seek lasting 
solutions to the problems facing our nation and pray for a society 
with liberty and justice for all the alleviation of want and 
the restoration of hope to all our people 
this thanksgiving as we enjoy the company of family and 
friends let us gratefully turn our hears to god the loving source 
of all life and liberty let us seek his forgiveness for our 
shortcomings and transgressions and renew our determination to 
remain a people worthy of his continued favor and protection 
acknowledging our dependence on the almighty obeying his 
commandments and reaching out to help those who do not share fully 
in this nations bounty is the most heartfelt and meaningful answer 
we can give the timeless appeal of the psalmist o give thanks to 
the lord for he is good for his steadfast love endures forever 
finally on this thanksgiving day let us also remember all 
those americans abroad who labor to advance the ideals for which 
this great nation stands whether peace corps volunteers or 
military or diplomatic personnel these selfless individuals often 
accept great personal risks and sacrifices to serve our country 
let us remember in particular those americans held hostage and 
members of the armed forces serving in the persian gulf region on 
this day let us pray for their wellbeing and their safe return to 
the united states and let us be thankful that such fine men and 
women are still willing to answer the call of duty to country and 
to defend the cause of liberty 
now therefore i george bush president of the united states 
of america do hereby call upon the american people to observe 
thursday november 22 1990 as a national day of thanksgiving and 
to gather together in homes and places of worship on that day of 
thanks to affirm by their prayers and their gratitude the many 
blessings god has bestowed upon us 
in witness whereof i have hereunto set by hand this fourteenth 
day of november in the year of our lord nineteen hundred and 
ninety and of the independence of the united states of america the 
two hundred and fifteenth

a 63yearold former teacher accused of 
molesting two generations of his male students drew 20 years in 
prison and a 25000 fine 
douglas marks who was sentenced wednesday had pleaded guilty 
to molesting four elementary school boys between 1985 and 1989 the 
fathers of two of those boys said they too had been victims of 
marks years ago 
court records cited 22 instances of molestation dating to 1956 
most too old to prosecute prosecutor richard llewellyn said he has 
found 45 victims 
last week i spared you a minitrial i cant spare you any 
longer judge frank davis said at a hearing last week the judge 
refused to let some of marks victims testify saying i wasnt 
going to embarrass this poor man any more 
the former teacher is a member of a prominent local family that 
owns substantial ranch property and a sawmill about 40 people 
watched the sentencing including marks brother former speaker of 
the montana house bob marks 
marks had built a reputation as a devoted and selfless teacher 
in boulder though questions about his behavior were raised as long 
ago as 1959 
he was forced to resign a high school post that year after three 
boys said he molested them he later taught at nearby clancy and 
returned to boulder in 1965 at an elementary school he resigned 
after the latest charges surfaced 
the onetime student whose tip led to the educators prosecution 
said he was satisfied with marks punishment paul myrhow 24 was 
molested by marks in 1980 and reported him five years later it was 
only last year that marks was charged 
im not pleased that the delays took place myrhow said 
but i am very pleased with todays results i think theyre 
fair 
myrhow said he felt some townspeople knew marks was molesting 
students and did little or nothing to prevent it but that he 
wasnt bitter about the handling of the case 
i have to live in that town he said i spend a lot of 
time there and have a lot of friends 
marks should be eligible for parole in about five years 
llewellyn said while on parole he will be forbidden from contact 
with anyone under 18 
the fine will pay for counseling for marks victims and other 
young people involved in sex crimes

scientists today reported finding what may be the 
best evidence yet that an abnormality in the brain causes 
hyperactivity an inability to pay attention sit still and behave 
the study found it may be hard for hyperactive people to 
concentrate because the parts of their brains that control 
attention dont work as hard as normal 
this is the first large study of hyperactivity that shows some 
sort of metabolic abnormality said dr alan j zametkin who 
directed the research at the national institute of mental health in 
bethesda md 
brain scans of adults afflicted with the disorder since 
childhood showed that their brain cells were 8 percent less active 
than those of normal people the reduction was especially dramatic 
in the parts of the brain that control attention and inhibit 
behavior 
hyperactivity known technically as attention 
deficithyperactivity disorder is the most common mental illness 
of childhood afflicting 2 percent to 4 percent of schoolage 
children 
the disorder makes children inattentive and impulsive they tend 
to blurt out answers in school run into the street without looking 
and fidget squirm and jump about their hot tempers and 
disobedience make them difficult for parents and teachers to 
handle 
about half the time the disorder persists into adulthood and 
victims are more likely to have runins with the law and abuse 
drugs and alcohol 
about threequarters of victims improve when given mild 
stimulant drugs such as ritalin that help them concentrate just 
why these medicines work is unclear 
zametkin said he hoped the latest findings will reduce the 
stigma attached to being treated for this disorder by showing that 
it involves a biological abnormality 
his research published in todays new england journal of 
medicine was conducted on 25 adults who had been hyperactive since 
childhood they were also parents of hyperactive youngsters 
the researchers compared the metabolism the rate at which 
energy is used in the brains of the hyperactive adults and 50 
normal people they found that brain activity was significantly 
lower among hyperactives in 30 of 60 regions of the brain 
in particular they noticed reductions in the premotor cortex 
and the superior prefrontal cortex these parts of the brain 
control attention damage to them can result in distractibility 
inattention and difficulty controlling inappropriate behavior 
in an accompanying editorial dr gabrielle weiss of montreal 
childrens hospital said the findings represent a clear advance 
in our understanding of hyperactivity but whether low metabolism 
is the ultimate cause of hyperactivity is still unclear 
im not going to say its the cause said zametkin we 
have to look at young kids and people with the nongenetic form of 
the disorder but its possible this has something to do with the 
cause 
dr paul h wender of the university of utah said a biological 
abnormality may not turn out to be the basic cause of 
hyperactivity instead the cortex may be sluggish because of 
faulty control signals from a more primitive part of the brain 
if the more primitive centers dont tell the guys upstairs to 
wake up they wont have attention he said but the problem is 
not in the cortex its the guys downstairs

us officials say they will oppose a proposal 
to make antarctica a world park permanently off limits to mining 
urging instead a limited moratorium on oil drilling and other 
minerals development 
the issue will be debated at talks opening monday in santiago 
chile among the 24 countries with voting rights under the 1959 
antarctica treaty 
environmental activists said they regretted the us decision to 
line up against the world park idea backed by france australia and 
new zealand 
the head of the us delegation assistant secretary of state 
eu curtis bohlen said wednesday that a longterm moratorium was 
the likely middle ground between those nations wanting to block 
mining forever and those like the united states unwilling to rule 
it out 
at the moment we have no legally binding controls bohlen 
said in a telephone interview a legally binding moratorium of 30 
years is clearly a big step forward 
will martin director of the wilderness societys antarctica 
project said the united states should be seeking the greatest 
possible protection for antarctica a frozen but fragile continent 
larger than the united states and mexico put together 
the proposal for a 30year moratorium would appear to be in 
favor of the antarctic environment but when you examine the 
proposal it turns out to be footdragging rather than leadership 
martin said 
the antarctica treaty nations held a minerals convention in 
wellington new zealand in 1988 aiming to impose international 
controls on any prospecting and development 
but opinion turned against the wellington convention which 
environmentalists argued would encourage mining australia and 
france led a campaign for a permanent ban on minerals development 
instead 
just before adjourning last month congress passed two bills 
opposing any minerals development in antarctica president bush has 
not said whether he will sign them 
the interior department prefers a moratorium as short as five 
years and has urged bush to veto the legislation department 
spokesman steve goldstein said 
we have environmental and national security concerns 
goldstein said if we sign a moratorium for a longer length of 
time then that could hamper us in our work with other countries 
because of the huge expense of operating in antarctica minerals 
development is not expected to be worth the effort for decades to 
come it is not even clear how much oil precious metals or other 
minerals might be found there 
a key issue in santiago is likely to be what happens once a 
moratorium ends 
bruce manheim a lawyer and scientist with the new yorkbased 
environmental defense fund said he hoped the countries will not 
approve a road map to development that kicks in after 30 years 
some nations he said were likely to propose that a moratorium 
be extended automatically unless all the treaty members agree to 
lift it manheim is a member of the us delegation for the talks 
opening monday 
the 24 nations that are consultative parties to the treaty with 
voting rights are australia argentina brazil belgium britain 
chile china finland france germany india italy japan south 
korea new zealand norway peru poland south africa the soviet 
union spain sweden the united states and uruguay

it used to be that couples striving for 
parenthood said so with a blush and a demure were trying now 
three iowa couples are forgoing such niceties in a radio contest to 
see who conceives first 
its not really anything different than what other people do 
its just that were telling the whole world that were trying to 
have kids said roger fouche 
fouche is one of three husbands entered in the breeders cup 
contest sponsored by krnqfm which has offered prizes to the first 
couple to conceive a similar competition is being run by a radio 
station in pensacola fla 
the iowa contestants efforts are being performed behind closed 
doors thank goodness but every friday morning the couples go on 
the air to talk about their experiences and the women take 
pregnancy tests at the station 
when a pregnancy is confirmed by a doctor the winner will 
receive a 1000 savings bond six months diaper service and a 
crib 
we had been trying for about five months so we figured we 
might as well win some prizes while were trying said fouches 
wife ann 27 
i called my dad hes from illinois he thought it was a riot 
my inlaws got into town they were gone over the weekend and 
their best friends handed them the newspaper article they were 
shocked everyones found out one way or another 
its the nontraditional way 
the breeders cup kicked off last friday each woman took a 
pregnancy test in the morning and the couples all had a free stay 
in a hotel that night 
the whole thing started when the morning guys started talking 
about connie chung said scott schubert krnq sales manager we 
thought why not have a contest to see who can beat connie chung 
the cbs newswoman said earlier this year she was cutting back 
her onair duties to concentrate on getting pregnant 
the breeders cup was open to married couples without children 
nearly 20 applied the fouches who live in des moines lisa and 
james machamer of des moines and wayne and colleen tendall of 
johnston were chosen by lots 
i wanted something that was just kind of wacky said 
machamer 22 weve been trying for five six months now not that 
it will spur us on or anything i just thought it would be fun 
fouche 27 said hes not embarrassed to talk about his efforts 
i dont know if we really get into sex habits but if youre 
having kids or want kids youre obviously having sex he said 
asked if the contest has made any difference in his trying 
fouche said things have definitely improved 
in florida two weeks ago wtkxfm said it would award its gulf 
coast breeders cup and 1000 to the first of three couples to 
conceive

natos military planners face a 
curious task as member nations extend a hand of friendship to 
moscow the planners are mapping a new strategy for defending 
against the red army 
the soviets remain europes biggest military power 
emerging details of the new nato strategy show an emphasis on 
smaller more flexible integrated armies and on rapid deployment 
capabilities to areas that might be threatened nuclear weapons 
will play a smaller role 
the strategy ordered by nato leaders at a london summit in 
july remains largely under wraps 
it assumes that soviet forces do not pose the threat they did 
under mikhail s gorbachevs predecessors but emphasizes that the 
western alliance must remain strong in case of a sudden change in 
policy by moscow 
nato is not on the rocks said gen hannshenning von 
sandrart who commands more than half a million nato troops in 
central europe 
the military threat may have lessened but nobody says that as 
a consequence of what happens in the east we should abandon nato 
the german general told reporters recently in his home near his 
headquarters in this southern dutch town 
the new planning comes amid unprecedented changes 
next week nato and the nations of the disintegrating warsaw 
pact are to sign a treaty in paris limiting battle tanks armored 
combat vehicles artillery combat planes and assault helicopters 
across europe 
under the treaty the 16 allies of the north atlantic treaty 
organization will remove 8000 pieces of military equipment the 16 
warsaw pact nations about 100000 
deployments on each side are likely to ultimately fall below the 
20000 tanks 30000 armored vehicles 20000 artillery pieces 
2000 combat aircraft and 6800 attack helicopters allowed under 
the treaty 
moscow has already promised to withdraw all its forces from the 
soil of its former allies by 1994 
and because of changed deployments in eastern europe nato 
planners believe the warning time the alliance would have of an 
attack from the east is now days or weeks rather than the minutes 
it counted on previously 
the new defense strategy will reflect a reduced reliance on 
nuclear arms 
the united states will not modernize its shortrange lance 
missiles and nuclear artillery shells leaving only aircraft 
carrying freefall bombs in europe chances of deploying a new 
airtosurface missile are seen as slim 
in the alliances new plans no nato commander will feel the 
changes more than von sandrart 
the german general commands eight army corps 560000 troops on 
what was once armageddons doorstep the area including germany 
luxembourg belgium and the netherlands that was expected to bear 
the brunt an armored warsaw pact assault 
but his eight corps in natos central region three german two 
american and one each from britain belgium and the netherlands 
have become anachronistic 
i can see the central region going down to four maybe five 
corps within three years von sandrart 
the remaining corps 300000 troops would each comprise three 
multinational divisions of 25000odd troops most would be 
guard forces others would be divisionstrength rapid 
reaction forces 
von sandrart said there is a strong case for more 
multinational integration of forces currently nato operates a 
layer cake of national forces deployed sidebyside 
with more multinational integration of forces would come a 
greater integration of arms a goal that has long eluded nato 
the alliances members make four different main battle tanks 
that fire different shells 
half a dozen make communications systems unable to speak 
with each other none are compatible with natos own communications 
system 
key to natos new strategy remains the notion enshrined in the 
nato treaty that an attack against one ally shall be considered 
an attack against them all 
military planners do not see the end of the cold war undermining 
natos relevance as an outfit for military and political 
consultations one that links the united states to europe and is a 
guarantee against a military mobilization in any one country 
while the allies agree events outside natos borders notably in 
the middle east affect their interests the alliance is unlikely 
to engage in joint operations although the issue is under debate 
that is a highly political question said von sandrart 
first our political masters will have to come to grips with 
that 
at any rate natos new strategy does not foresee an 
outofarea presence of nato troops under allied command 
joint outofarea operations do not enjoy much support in nato 
capitals said simon lunn deputy secretary general of the north 
atlantic assembly a consultative body of lawmakers from the nato 
nations

the number of americans who developed 
repetitive motion disorders on the job jumped 28 percent in 1989 
accounting for nearly all of the increase in workplace injuries 
last year the government says 
about 147000 repetitive trauma disorders among american workers 
were reported last year 32000 more than in 1988 the labor 
department said wednesday 
repetitive motion disorders include illnesses such as carpal 
tunnel syndrome which causes pain in the wrists and forearms the 
disorders often are suffered by workers on assembly lines who 
repeat the same motions with their arms and hands throughout the 
day 
the labor department said there were 284000 reported cases of 
occupational illness and 63 million jobrelated injuries among 
workers in private industry in 1989 that was 136000 more than the 
241000 illnesses and 62 million injuries in 1988 
although total injuries and illnesses increased by about 2 
percent last year their rate of occurrence in the labor force 
86 per 100 fulltime workers was the same as in 1988 the bureau 
of labor statistics said the increase in numbers of injuries and 
illnesses tracked the increase in employment and hours worked 
proportionately 
the survey found about 3600 workrelated deaths but the agency 
cautioned that the estimate is probably understated because its 
survey was not large enough to accurately track all fatalities 
the aflcio which represents 142 million unionized workers 
estimates that 10000 american workers are killed on the job each 
year and 70000 are permanently disabled 
assistant labor secretary gerard scannell who heads the 
occupational safety and health administration said he was 
disappointed there had been no decrease in the rate of onthejob 
injuries and illnesses 
these results highlight the challenges that continue to face 
employers employees and osha scannell said 
injuries from accidents at work are reportable if they result in 
death loss of consciousness restricted work activity a transfer 
to another job or medical treatment beyond first aid 
almost half of the 63 million injury cases were serious enough 
for the injured worker to have work activity restricted or to lose 
work time those cases resulted in about 57 million lost workdays 
in 1989 the labor department said 
manufacturing had about 20 percent of the private sector 
employment in 1989 but slightly more than 33 percent of total 
reported injuries in contrast the services industry had nearly 30 
percent of the employment total but only 16 percent of the injury 
cases 
nine individual industries reported at least 100000 injury 
cases each they were motor vehicle manufacturing eating and 
drinking establishments wholesale groceries retail grocery 
stores hospitals trucking and overtheroad couriers nursing and 
personal care facilities department stores and hotels and motels

television manufacturers broadcasters and a 
prestigious university plan to square off next year over whose 
stateoftheart technology will bring highdefinition tv to 
america by the mid1990s 
the federal communications commission on wednesday announced an 
april 8 1991 start date for a yearlong series of tests to 
determine which of five competing systems should be the us 
standard for hdtv the fcc should decide the issue by june 1993 
the applicants include the japan broadcasting corp and europes 
major tv manufacturers which already are beginning to implement 
their own systems overseas 
the commission also said it will test a sixth proposal a 
partial hdtv system being proposed by a david sarnoff research 
center consortium that includes thomson consumer electronics and 
nbc 
hdtv promises crystalclear pictures and compact discquality 
sound by cable satellite or through traditional broadcasters such 
as abc cbs and nbc its advocates say it could be a 
multibilliondollar industry on its own by the year 2000 and 
possibly revitalize a lagging us electronics sector 
hdtv entertainment programs are expected to appear by 1995 for 
those able to afford it in japan where hdtv already is being 
delivered an hour a day to satellite dishes hdtv sets cost 17800 
and up 
besides giving the public a sharper view of roseanne the 
advanced television has potential military educational and medical 
applications 
us testing originally was to have begun this year but the 
schedule slipped because of changing proposals from nearly a dozen 
interested companies and unexpected difficulties in developing 
proper testing equipment 
fcc chairman alfred sikes said the test schedule was ambitious 
but realistic 
he cautioned however that the fcc should not rush to judgment 
on an hdtv standard at the same time he said the nation cannot 
afford to wait too long to launch hdtv 
japan expects to have fulltime coverage in 1992 and europeans 
are expected to be able to watch the 1992 olympics on a european 
hdtv system 
the testing will take place at the advanced television test 
center in alexandria va it will run for about two months for each 
proposal in conjunction with cable labs the cable industrys 
research arm viewertesting of the proposals will follow in 
canada along with field testing here 
five of the six applicants are proposing to completely or 
partially use the computerprecise technique of digital 
electronics as opposed to the current analog systems 
the six applicants in the order of testing are the david 
sarnoff research center japan broadcasting corp general 
instrument corp zenith electronics corp na philips consumer 
electronics co and the massachusetts institute of technology 
sikes said other applicants could be considered in the testing 
if they come up with different technology that appears to offer 
important benefits to the public 
in order not to make millions of existing tv sets obsolete the 
commission says the winning hdtv system must use a simulcast 
technique tv stations would have to broadcast two signals one on 
its regularly assigned channel in todays format known as ntsc and 
the other in highdefinition on a separate channel 
although congress has provided some money for us hdtv research 
through the defense department and other agencies the american 
electronics industry is basically going it alone against foreign 
competitors that are being heavily subsidized by their governments

education reforms of the past decade sparked a 
move toward greater equality rather than greater excellence the 
head of the nations largest testing organization says 
gregory r anrig president of the educational testing service 
released a series of reports wednesday that showed considerable 
reductions in the educational achievement gaps between 
17yearold black students and white students however they showed 
little progress in reducing gaps between hispanic and white 
students 
paul barton director of ets policy information center said 
officials plan to investigate whether immigration trends had 
anything to do with the difficulty of closing the gap between 
17yearold hispanics and whites 
the hallmark of the decade was a move toward greater equality 
rather than a move toward greater excellence said anrig 
its going to take some time for the results of reform efforts 
undertaken in the 1980s to appear said anrig the declines of 
the 1970s were the result of a loosening of standards in the 1960s 
thus for most students improvements that may result from reforms 
of the 1980s probably wont appear until the mid1990s 
minorities however can be justifiably proud of their 
steadily improving academic achievement during this period of 
sweeping change he said 
the assessment was based on results of the national assessment 
of educational progress a congressionally mandated exam of 
children age 9 13 and 17 and on results of the scholastic 
aptitude test taken by students who plan to go to college 
between black and white 17yearolds taking the naep tests the 
report found that in reading the gap declined from 506 scale 
points in 1980 to 203 in 1988 a 60 percent drop the scale is 
from 0 to 500 
in science the gap narrowed from 574 scale points in 1977 to 
447 in 1986 a 22 percent decline in mathematics there was a 23 
percent decrease in the gap from 375 scale points in 1978 to 289 
scale points in 1986 
in sat scores from 1980 to 1990 the blackwhite gap narrowed by 
22 points in verbal and 16 points in math a decrease of 20 percent 
and 13 prcent respectively 
the report said there now is little difference in the percent of 
16 to 24yearold blacks and whites getting a high school diploma 
the 6 percentage point gap in 1980 was reduced to 2 percentage 
points in 1989 however far fewer blacks went on to college ets 
said 
the report said hispanic 13yearolds were the only age group 
that showed improvement on the naep test the gap between their 
performance on the test and that of 13yearold whites was reduced 
by 43 percent in math and by 22 percent in science 
with the sat scores there was about a 10 percent reduction in 
the gap between mexicanamerican and white students in verbal and 
math results and a 11 percent reduction in the gap between puerto 
rican and white students on the verbal test there was virtually no 
reduction in the gap on the math test 
barton noted that throughout the decade females continued to 
outperform males in reading in mathematics males led females but 
the gap was small the gap favoring males continued in science and 
females outperformed males considerably in writing although the 
gap narrowed a little 
the performance gap between the southeast and northeast also 
narrowed by 57 percent in mathematics 44 percent in civics and 30 
percent in science said barton 
in other findings the report said that by the end of the 1980s 
42 states raised high school graduation requirements and 47 states 
had installed statewide student testing programs in addition 
sweeping changes in teacher standards were adopted in 39 states 
many states also adopted statewide education accountability 
systems 
stricter attendance policies were adopted by 73 percent of high 
schools 61 percent of middle schools and 46 percent of elementary 
schools longer school days also were reported in 40 percent of 
high schools

about us interest rates 
market players have been expecting the us federal reserve to 
lower interest rates in an effort to boost the nations weakening 
economy 
many participants tried to push the dollar as high as 12980 yen 
so that they can take profits while they were also afraid of a 
demand for the dollar as a safe haven dealers said 
investors are more interested in the european currencies 
said masato hayashi a dealer at the bank of tokyo 
the yen was gradually strengthening against the german mark 
dealers said 
on the stock exchange traders said share prices were lower 
across the board due to selling by market players discouraged by 
the yens weakness

by raising the spectre of a declaration of 
nearwar against iraq congressional republicans are pressuring 
democrats to stop carping and share some political responsibility 
with president bush 
its time to put up or shut up was how senate minority 
leader bob dole put it making clear that shut up was his 
preferred option 
as public support for bush and americas persian gulf operation 
has softened democrats have become increasingly bold in finding 
fault with the presidents handling of the crisis 
democrats have been supporting the overall policy but taking 
shots at bush for new troop increases failure to justify his 
actions and failure to consult adequately with congress 
i think the president must explain more completely his policy 
to the american people and he has a constitutional responsibility 
to consult more widely with congress house majority leader 
richard gephardt dmo said wednesday adding that democrats 
otherwise support a policy of patient strength 
to republicans the democratic position is to look good for 
supporting the president and provide themselves political cover in 
case the whole operation turns sour and republicans are tired of 
it 
almost daily theres some senator out there saying or some 
member of the house saying well hes not doing this right or we 
didnt know this or we should have been consulted on this dole 
said we cant have it both ways 
the appearance of partisan divisions prompted sen richard 
lugar rind an influential foreign policy expert to suggest 
this week that congress come back into special session to consider 
the equivalent of a declaration of war 
so long as saddam hussein and the rest of the world have any 
doubt about the unified resolve of the united states in this 
matter the chances for miscalculation and tragic mistakes loom 
much too large he said 
democrats seeking to maintain their current advantages 
answered lugars proposal by announcing they would hold hearings 
but that wouldnt accomplish the same purpose 
if you could have hearings and have a consensus with everybody 
agreeing on it fine said mark helmke a consultant and former 
top aide to lugar but the issues been aired out pretty 
heavily what we want is a resolve 
bush will consider after thanksgiving whether to call for such a 
session dole said wednesday after meeting with the president 
dole himself however expressed doubts about the idea he and 
other gop and democratic leaders expressed worry that a special 
session would only enhance political gamesmanship harming us 
efforts to present a united front to the world and maintain 
pressure on saddam 
how do you have a consultation in the american tradition 
without sending the wrong signal to saddam hussein i think thats 
the 64 question dole said 
i have been concerned that our position could be greatly 
weakened by a growth of partisanship on this issue said sen 
phil gramm rtexas 
despite the democrats sniping gramm said he did not believe 
they would risk undermining troops in the field for partisan gain 
many democrats are biting around the edges but theyre not 
willing to bite off a big chunk he said 
democrats didnt argue with that assessment and leaders of both 
parties were steering away from lugars idea wednesday unless 
things change 
i dont think you could pass a pro or antiwar 
resolution said a top aide to house speaker thomas s foley 
dwash 
and since congress would be pressured to pass something the 
result likely would be some high lofty resolution the 
interpretation of which is left up in the air he said 
foley said he would not put democrats in a position where they 
could potentially embarrass themselves 
helmke said those misgivings made it all the more imperative 
that congress vote on the matter 
if members dont have the guts to say what they think then 
that should be revealed to the public he said

the new chairman of the us league of 
savings institutions was once shunned by the trade groups leaders 
for warning correctly that the government fund protecting the 
industrys deposits was bankrupt 
that was in 1985 now five years later the organization has 
turned to toughtalking donald shackelford to lead the industry 
next year when it will be fighting for its very survival 
shackelford chairman of state savings bank in columbus ohio 
one of the nations strongest sampls closed the groups 98th annual 
convention wednesday by declaring the era of the fast buckaroos 
to be over 
in the mid1980s when shackelford was feuding with league 
leaders the group was fighting to keep its members from paying to 
clean up the mess now he told sampl executives our policy has to 
be defined to be totally consistent with public policy 
shackelford praised provisions in last years law requiring 
thrift owners to invest more of their own capital that has 
succeeded in curbing the irresponsible growth of the industry he 
said 
we want capital standards that are as high as anybody who 
takes your mothers money depositors money he said the new 
guys coming in the fast buckaroos thats over 
however the new law has failed to attract the investors needed 
to reduce the governments risks shackelford said and surviving 
sampls must attract new capital if taxpayers are to be insulated from 
future losses 
the only way to get government out is to get private capital 
in there arent three sources its either private money or the 
governments money there is no tinkerbell coming to put money 
in he said 
in an interview after his speech shackelford criticized rules 
which force thrift institutions to concentrate 70 percent of their 
assets on housing even when real estate markets are in the 
doldrums 
and he said wouldbe investors have been scared off by 
uncertainty over whether the government will try to take a bigger 
share of the profits from the industryowned federal home loan 
banks which supply funds to sampls 
in addition regulation of sampls has gone from tough to mean in 
some cases he said 
weve got a regulatory climate now that people are running 
around trying to cover their rear ends so much theyre going to get 
diaper rash he said youve got to learn to distinguish 
between double parkers and rapists you dont have to be for either 
one but you have to treat them differently 
shackelford is vaulting over robert b obrien chairman of 
carteret savings bank morristown nj who asked to remain as 
league vice chairman while he works to solve the debt problems of 
carterets holding company 
meanwhile postmaster general anthony m frank former chairman 
of first nationwide bank a san francisco sampl warned that the cost 
of dealing with failed sampls is still growing 
i believe were facing a problem north of 500 billion he 
said i believe the thrift situation has the potential and even 
the probability to make our country a secondrate power 
frank unlike many at the convention said thrifts must remain a 
separate industry from commercial banks supervised by their own 
regulator and dedicated to providing financial services to 
households as opposed to businesses

a texan faces up to eight years in 
prison and a 1 million fine for bilking two banks by posing as a 
nobleman from frances wealthy rothschild family 
a federal jury deliberated an hour wednesday before convicting 
maur rothschild 38 of fraud rothschild who changed his name 
from mario cortez jr and had claimed to be a baron faces 
sentencing jan 30 
defense attorney matthew martin said the banks were partly to 
blame 
dont you know the folks at these institutions began to 
salivate when they heard a member of the internationallyknown 
family of rothschild had come to durham martin said the banks 
were involved in his fantasy as well 
the charges involved credit and creditcard applications at the 
duke federal credit union and wachovia bank amp trust co in 1987 and 
1989 rothschild signed applications as baron maurice de 
rothschild once listing his mother as baroness maurie de 
rothschild 
the prosecution refused to say how much money rothschild 
obtained but it was believed to be thousands of dollars 
rothschild testified that he was a psychologically troubled man 
who got caught up in his fantasies he said that the banks 
pressured him into taking loans and never verified his identity 
but assistant us attorney john stone said rothschild was 
nothing more than a con man who finally got caught 
rothschild said that while he was a student at duke university 
in 1987 he began to believe he was a member of frances 
rothschilds he said he had been abused as a child and had 
undergone extensive therapy and basically it got to a point where 
i lived out my fantasies 
rothschild also faces state charges that he fraudulently 
obtained 1200 from a cancer fund in durham in 1989

the security council and israel have 
agreed that a un envoy will visit israel to discuss ways of 
protecting palestinians the us ambassador says in an apparent 
end to a bitter standoff 
israels refusal to allow a un visit after police killed at 
least 17 palestinians during last months temple mount riot had 
threatened arabus unity in the persian gulf crisis 
us ambassador thomas r pickering said wednesday after meeting 
with the 15 council members that i detected a very strong note of 
interest in the council in the mission going ahead so i assume it 
will go ahead 
israels international isolation has increased since it refused 
to cooperate with a security council request to send un 
investigators to check on the oct 8 slayings at temple mount in 
jerusalems walled old city 
the united states joined the other 14 council members in voting 
unanimously oct 12 to condemn israeli security forces for firing 
on palestinian demonstrators and again a week later to criticize 
israel for refusing to receive the un mission 
last weekend israel suggested that un envoy jeanclaude aime 
could visit israel but only if he discussed the palestinian 
problem as he did in june not probe the killings on the temple 
mount 
the position of the government of israel was read out to the 
council in private on wednesday said pickering speaking in his 
capacity as president of the security council during november 
everybody concluded that that didnt set any conditions for 
the mission he said 
secretarygeneral javier perez de cuellar will have to approve 
of sending aime earlier this week a spokeswoman for the 
secretarygeneral said the un chief does not accept conditions on 
missions he sends to foreign countries 
if the security council does not see israels invitations as 
setting conditions presumably aimes mission can proceed 
aime was in israel in june to investigate the killings of seven 
palestinians by an israeli in the tel aviv suburb of rishon lezion 
on may 20 and subsequent riots in the occupied territories in which 
the army shot and killed 20 palestinians 
israel has argued that accepting a security council 
investigation on the temple mount incident would threaten the 
countrys claim to sovereignty over predominantly arab east 
jerusalem where the temple mount is located 
the jewish state captured the eastern sector of the city from 
jordan in the 1967 arabisraeli war and later annexed it the 
annexation is not recognized by the united states united nations 
or most other nations 
israel also seized the west bank and gaza strip in the war but 
did not annex them for nearly three years palestinians have been 
in revolt in the territories seeking to end israeli occupation

mcdonalds corp is hoping the healthconscious 
will want to sink their teeth into a new superlean hamburger that 
replaces some of the fat with an algae product 
the oak brook illbased fastfood giant announced wednesday it 
is test marketing the 91 percent fatfree burger in 54 franchises 
in the harrisburg pa area 
were excited about it and are very optimistic said chuck 
rubner a mcdonalds spokesman they like the taste of the 
product and they like the fact that its a lowfat alternative 
the lean deluxe quarterpound burger with condiments has a 105 
percent fat content and 310 calories that compares to a 207 
percent fat content and about 410 calories in the mcdonalds 
regular quarter pounder 
thats unbelievable said michael jacobson director of the 
center for science in the public interest a consumer group in 
washington obviously id have to taste it but it could be the 
best burger on the market in terms of fat content 
the patty is composed of 90 percent lean beef 9 percent water 
and 1 percent seasonings rubner said carrageenan a gumlike algae 
product used in meats and other foods to bind ingredients is 
listed as one of its seasonings 
the secret to the hamburger is the carrageenan hailed by the 
beef industry as revolutionary because it binds the patty 
together much as fat would said mary adolf of the beef industry 
council of the meat board 
the board funded auburn university work to develop the lowfat 
beef and mcdonalds was the first to testmarket it 
its very similar in taste and texture to a standardtype 
ground beef patty adolf said 
nutrition experts welcomed the development but cautioned that it 
is one new product in a menu loaded with fat and cholesterol 
one has to look at a foods place in relation to the total 
diet said karen millerkovach spokeswoman for the american 
dietetic association 
if you go into a restaurant order the fatfree burger and 
an extralarge order of fries then you may not be doing yourself 
any favor 
the new hamburger also does little to reduce sodium content 
said jacobson

bottles of beaujolais popped open across france 
today as this years production of the fruity red wine was released 
to rave reviews 
experts hailed the 1990 beaujolais as among the best thanks to 
grapes with a high sugar content because of a drought 
its a very good year with a very good aroma said michel 
pouilhis an accountant after a few glasses of the rubyred 
vintage at le lutin wine bar and restaurant but whats most 
important is the tradition the french love tradition 
that tradition dictates that sales of beaujolais are embargoed 
until midnight of the third thursday in november 
the japanese usually the first in world to taste beaujolais 
because of the time difference eight hours ahead of france will 
have to wait until nov 22 before raising beaujolais in a 
kampai cheers 
the tokyo government has suspended cargo flights into japan for 
the next week as a security measure for a series of enthronement 
rituals for newly crowned emperor akihito 
philippe girard owner of le lutin near the arc de triomphe 
lives and breathes by the beaujolais tradition even bottling it 
himself after buying it by the barrel 
i spent six hours washing 70 bottles yesterday girard said 
i take it seriously the proof is that while i was bottling i 
didnt drink a single drop and then at one past midnight clack 
i offered a glass on the house to every customer here now 
thats tradition 
a widespread and highly orchestrated advertising blitz heralds 
beaujolais arrival each year its the biggest commercial 
publicity operation ever invented in the world said girard 
its big business 
but there is nevertheless a genuine eagerness surrounding its 
arrival 
its like a nationwide festival a second july 14th said 
wine merchant patrice marcoue referring to national celebrations 
marking the french revolution 
marcoue who owns the caves mermoz wine cellar in paris chic 
st honore district was delighted with beaujolais 1990 
like the last two years it is superb he said its 
fruity low in alcohol and rolls on the tongue 
other oenophiles are describing this years vintage in gallic 
sensual terms racy tender fullbodied and 
wellformed 
the wine is named after the beaujolais region in eastern france 
near the swiss border where 8900 acres of vineyards yield the 
unassuming wine with a worldwide following 
its not a noble wine said marcoue it goes well with 
sausage 
yet more than half of the 75 million bottles produced this year 
will be exported to 80 countries led by germany britain japan 
and the united states according to the interprofessional union of 
beaujolais 
american wine lovers almost missed beaujolais this year because 
of the presence of the banned fungicide procymidone washington and 
paris haggled briefly before agreeing on the exports 
the wine costs 4 to 7 per bottle in france but a whopping 27 
per airlifted bottle in tokyo prices in the japanese capital tend 
to sink to about 8 for later arrivals 
the very good vintages are this year 1985 and 1989 1987 
was considered average and 1984 below par 
bistros and restaurants across france prepared for their annual 
deluge of longtime clientele and old friends wanting to taste the 
wine on its first day

complaining that the selection process 
too often puts personality ahead of grades some high schools 
around the country are dropping or considering eliminating their 
national honor society chapters 
hampshire regional high school last week joined those that have 
withdrawn from the 22000chapter nhs a program that high school 
students with a b average have listed on their college 
appliations for the past 70 years 
the school complained that entrance requirements of character 
leadership and service are too subjective 
too often selection becomes a matter of personality said 
deborah niswonger chairwoman of the school board that oversees 
645student hampshire high she said the nonscholastic criteria 
rule out too many serious students 
at the urging of teachers including the nhs adviser the board 
voted to install its own honor society with grades the only 
criteria our faculty really cares about kids and not just one 
kind of kid niswonger said 
hampshire was the only school in the past year to quit the 
society said dale hawley director of student activities for the 
national association of secondary school principals the 
association has overseen the nhs since a group of high school 
principals in pittsburgh started the student recognition group in 
1920 
although schools have wide latitude in using the selection 
criteria they cannot base their decision soley on academics 
hawley said we are looking for the total child who is 
outstanding both in and out of the classroom he said 
and deportment counts 
local faculty councils tolerate different levels of 
behavior hawley said but there are a lot of smart people who 
may be working hard but not chosen because they have not 
demonstrated strong character 
its those criteria that moved hampshire and other schools to 
opt out of the society 
cony high school in augusta maine hasnt had an nhs chapter 
for at least seven years and hasnt missed it said principal 
charles adams 
people felt the issues of leadership character service and 
whatever were too difficult to quantify he said 
instead the top 10 percent of each class at the 1000student 
school are cony scholars and get a pin and a gold cord at 
graduation 
roger lonbaker principal at t f riggs high school in pierre 
sd said if i was a betting man id bet there isnt a school 
that has a national honor society chapter that hasnt at some point 
in time considered changing 
his 550student school will continued in the organization 
until we really find it is too frustrating lonbaker said 
the move to buck the nhs at hampshire high began after a parent 
wanted to know why a child had been rejected the fivemember 
faculty selection committee had no written records and said it 
couldnt recall why 
hawley said national guidelines call for secret elections with 
no explanation for why students are rejected there is no 
opportunity for appeal 
the student president of hampshires nhs chapter said she was 
disappointed to see it go i just feel they are taking away an 
honor said amy christienson its a distinguished group and 
people in the school know that 
but aaron domina another nhs member said he supported the 
move 
the way it is now there are people who have high averages 
who arent honored he said

an ink image of summer fields sketched by 
vincent van gogh with a reed he cut from the banks of a french 
canal sold at auction for 86 million the highest price ever 
paid for a drawing 
garden of flowers was sold wednesday to an anonymous bidder 
at christies auction of modern and impressionist art the bid 
topped the auction houses presale estimate of 5 million to 7 
million 
the sale of the van gogh came in the midst of what art experts 
say is a slumping art market 
the previous record for a drawing was for a raphael sold at 
christies london in 1984 for 477 million 
van gogh drew the work in 1888 with a reed cut by the banks of 
one of the canals near arles in the south of france at the time 
he needed to save money on the more expensive oil and canvas 
supplies 
in a letter to his brother theo the artist wrote about the 
energetic ink strokes he used to draw a field and houses in arles 
i have just sent off three big drawings and the little cottage 
done vertically is i think the best 
the rest of christies auction wednesday was further proof of 
the softening art market many of the finest works of the late 19th 
and early 20th centuries sold below the presale estimates or not 
at all 
one surprises was the failure to sell van goghs oil vase with 
cornflowers and poppies which was estimated to be worth 12 
million to 16 million the highest bid was about 9 million below 
the minimum price 
the grim reaper has taken his toll said christies 
president christopher burge areas of the market that have been 
pushed to extraordinary heights have been eliminated were 
seeing speculators disappearing and other traditional collectors 
reappearing 
the highest price of the evening was paid for fernand legers 
oil houses beneath the trees which sold for 99 million to an 
unidentified american dealer the estimated presale price was 10 
million to 12 million 
of 47 works offered 15 failed to sell because they didnt meet 
the confidential minimum price set before the auction of the 32 
works that sold 17 matched or surpassed the presale price 
estimates christies said 
the total sale for wednesday night was 923 million

a new 583 million pipeline linking the 
northeast to canadian natural gas fields could start trimming the 
regions dependence on imported oil within as little as a year its 
developers say 
after four years of contentious debate among environmentalists 
homeowners and rival energy suppliers the federal energy 
regulatory commission on wednesday unanimously approved the 
iroquois pipeline project 
canada is going to play a role in our natural gas supply in 
the future and i think the iroquois pipeline is going to be an 
integral part of that said ferc board member jerry langdon 
ultimately tight energy supplies in new england new york and 
new jersey outweighed the concerns of pipeline opponents they 
ranged from wildcat oil drillers in the southwest to psychologist 
dr joyce brothers whose hudson valley estate in new york would be 
crossed by the line 
nearly half of new englands primary energy needs are now met by 
oil the region for example uses oil to generate nearly a third 
of its electricity compared to only 28 percent nationwide 
according to iroquois 
existing gas pipelines to the northeast from us gas fields 
have been running at capacity for years ferc is considering many 
applications to expand existing pipelines but iroquois is the only 
totally new line proposed for the region 
robert j reid president of the iroquois gas transmission 
system a consortium of us and canadian gas companies and 
utilities based in shelton conn said the consortium hopes to 
have gas flowing to new york and new england by november 1991 and 
to complete the line by january 1992 
the pipeline will extend 370 miles from the st lawrence river 
through the woodlands of upstate new york beneath the hudson 
river into affluent sections of western connecticut and across 
long island sound to long island 
it is designed to deliver 575 million cubic feet of gas daily 
or enough to meet the energy needs of 15 million homes some of 
the gas will go toward electricity generation rather than home 
heating and industrial uses 
transcanada pipelines ltd one of iroquois several owners 
estimated the new line will generate 1 billion per year in exports 
for canada canada has been supplying natural gas to the united 
states since the 1960s but mostly in the west and midwest

members of a scientific panel that drafted 
guidelines for adding steroids to the treatment of a killer 
pneumonia in people with aids disagree over whether they took too 
long to come up with teir findings 
in retrospect it should have happened more quickly paul 
meier professor of statistics at the university of chicago and 
vice chairman of the 17member panel said wednesday 
however dr henry masure the panels chairman and chief of 
critical care at the national institutes of health called the 
three months for the review a relatively short period 
i dont think it will ever get much faster he said since 
steroids weaken the immune system the whole concept of giving 
steroids to someone with aids is very novel and controversial 
aids activists had charged that the panel organized by the 
national institute of allergy and infectious diseases and the 
university of california at san diego took too long 
the broad outline of a consensus on the steroid issue was 
reached may 15 but it wasnt until late august that the panelists 
agreed on technical details such as who should get the therapy and 
in what doses 
on oct 10 the institute sent an alert to 2600 physicians 
informing them that recent studies had found benefits among some 
patients with pneumocycstis carinii pneumonia whose treatment was 
supplemented with steroids 
dr samuel bozzette assistant professor of medicine at the 
university of california at san diego and a panel member said that 
in a perfect system it could have been shorter but it was not 
an unreasonable amount of time

a soviet man who claimed he had a bomb 
hijacked an aeroflot passenger jet on a domestic flight and forced 
its crew to fly to helsinki where he surrendered to police on 
thursday national radio reported 
none of the 66 passengers or six crew members aboard were hurt 
the report said the hijacked aircraft landed at 530 am 
police chief commissioner kauko karhuviita said the tupolev 
aircraft had been en route to moscow from leningrad when the 
hijacker threatened to blow it up 
the hijacker wanted to fly to stockholm but the plane landed 
here the situation is under control now karhuviita said in a 
radio interview 
all the passengers are out of the plane and we are holding the 
hijacker it seems he will want to apply for political asylum 
karhuviita said 
three soviet planes have been hijacked to finland this year 
the government extradited two hijackers and refused political 
asylum for a third who is in police custoday 
three planes have been hijacked to sweden where authorities 
returned two to the soviets and allowed one to stay 
finlands practice has always been to return hijackers to the 
soviet union sweden previously allowed hijackers to stay 
the return of two men this year reflected swedish recognition of 
human rights gains in the soviet union and a desire to deter other 
hijackers

a lawyer for an antismoking group has blocked the adoption of 
national ventilation standards that he said could have caused 
thousands of deaths from secondhand cigarette smoke in public 
buildings 
the proposal misrepresents the available scientific evidence 
misleading engineers developers and building code authorities into 
believing that they can permit moderate amounts of smoking 
while avoiding significant adverse health effects from 
secondhand smoke attorney richard daynard wrote in an appeal to 
the american national standards institute in new york 
the standards institute said wednesday it sustained daynards 
appeal and did not adopt the standards 
daynard charged that the proposal reflected the aims of the 
tobacco industry which had sought to soften ventilation 
requirements in buildings where smoking is allowed 
the tobacco industry almost succeeded in pulling off a 
tremendous coup said daynard chairman of the tobacco products 
liability project in boston they were using the standards to 
cast doubt on the evidence that environmental tobacco smoke causes 
disease 
the tobacco institute has been sending employers a letter that 
says in part where ventilation is adequate and ventilation 
systems are properly maintained tobacco smoke is not a problem 
the letter bases that conclusion on the proposed ventilation 
standards 
brennan dawson a spokeswoman for the tobacco institute in 
washington denied that the institute had tried to influence the 
standards and she dismissed daynards concerns 
daynard would have us with a smokefree society she said 
his position has always been that you cannot protect people from 
anything daynard is really out in left field on this issue 
the dispute over the standards represents a major battle over 
smoking that took place almost entirely outside the publics view 
daynard said 
its an interesting glimpse into a hidden government which 
nobody elected and was not appointed by anyone we elected but sets 
the standards which govern the way we live the air we breathe 
he said 
the standards were written by a committee appointed by the 
american society of heating refrigerating and air conditioning 
engineers in atlanta 
ashrae then submitted the standards for adoption by the american 
national standards institute a private group that establishes a 
wide variety of industrial and consumer standards its standards 
are often written into law 
the institutes adoption of the ventilation standards would have 
enabled employers to defend themselves against charges they were 
endangering employees by allowing smoking in their buildings 
daynard said 
he said it is now likely the standards will be changed to 
reflect concerns about the toxic effects of cigarette smoke that 
could force many employers to ban smoking or face liability for the 
harm that tobacco smoke causes daynard said 
the environmental protection agency and the national research 
council have estimated that secondhand smoke causes 3800 deaths 
in nonsmoking americans each year 
a study presented earlier this year by stanton glantz and 
william parmley of the university of california at san francisco 
estimated that passive smoking causes 32000 heart disease deaths 
in nonsmokers each year and 53000 deaths overall 
the chairman of the ashrae committee that drafted the standards 
john janssen a honeywell engineer in minneapolis denied that the 
tobacco industry influenced the standards they arent all that 
interested he said 
janssen said the committee included three nonvoting members who 
have done business with the tobacco industry including a 
consultant hired by the tobacco institute to represent industry 
concerns one voting member also reviews grants for the center for 
indoor air research a tobaccoindustry supported organization in 
linthicum md 
members of antismoking groups did not regularly participate in 
the deliberations janssen said

slain by 33yearold david gray before police killed him in a 
shootout two children were wounded by gray who wiped out nearly 
half of aramoanas population 
gray began his killing spree tuesday night by setting a 
neighbors house on fire then opening fire on people who arrived 
to try to extinguish the blaze the motive for his actions remains 
unclear 
police kept the town cordoned off today except for forensic 
experts government officials and journalists 
gray who holed up in his home before fleeing to a house on the 
edge of town used highpowered rifles to shoot neighbors and keep 
police from reaching victims scattered on the lawn of his house and 
a nearby street 
detective chief inspector peter robinson told a news conference

kuwaiti officials say resistance fighters 
have smuggled out computer records on kuwaits entire preinvasion 
population helping frustrate iraqi efforts to erase all traces of 
their society 
the 25 computer discs are said to contain the names and 
fingerprints of the entire population before iraqs assault 
they are in new york and kuwaiti officials want the united 
nations to take custody of a set until the current crisis is over 
the ambassador of kuwaits governmentinexile mohammad a 
abulhasan said wednesday 
we have discovered from the first two weeks of the iraqi 
aggression that there is a deliberate plan for changing the 
demographic status of kuwait by destroying records he said 
abulhasan began circulating the text of a proposed resolution on 
wednesday which would call on un secretarygeneral javier perez 
de cuellar to take possession of a copy of the tapes for 
safekeeping 
us ambassador thomas r pickering said the proposal for the 
united nations to take possession of the records seems to us a 
very good idea 
one mainframe computer had all kuwaits demographic records 
abulhasan said armed with that fact we were able through the 
resistance movement to get out these records which are electronic 
discs he said 
the records were hidden during the first week of the occupation 
abulhasan said fifteen days ago we managed to get them out of 
kuwait 
iraq invaded kuwait on aug 2 and later annexed the oilrich 
emirate 
kuwaits governmentinexile and the un security council are 
concerned over iraqs attempt to convert occupied kuwait into a 
province of iraq and to move 150000 iraqis into buildings vacated 
by fleeing kuwaitis 
exiled kuwaitis accuse the baghdad government of trying to 
repopulate their country with supporters of president saddam 
hussein 
the underground movement salvaged information on all 175 
million residents of kuwait abulhasan said he said the 
information was current with names addresses and fingerprints 
the records will help to differentiate between the kuwaitis 
and the nonkuwaitis when the crisis is over and might be the 
basis for compensation claims he said

northern part of indonesias sumatra island and shook highrise 
buildings in thailand and malaysia today but officials said no 
casualties or damage were reported 
the quake caused momentary panic during the morning rush hour in 
the north sumatra capital of medan police there reported 
it struck at 934 am and was measured at 62 on the richter 
scale by monitors in indonesia and malaysia and at 69 by 
seismological agencies in thailand and the united states 
monitors put its location in the andaman sea between sumatra 
and the peninsula on which malaysia and southern thailand are 
located 
in bangkok thailands meteorological department received 
reports that tremors were felt in highrise buildings in phuket and 
nearby songkhla province as well as in bangkok about 430 miles 
north of phuket 
in kuala lumpur the tremors sent office workers scurrying down 
to the street from many highrise buildings

earthquake as measured by the ground motion recorded on a 
seismograph

the inventor of the intermittent windshield wiper 
says hes ready to take on nearly two dozen other automakers after 
accepting a 102 million settlement with ford motor co for 
infringing on his patents 
maybe i got to first base robert kearns 63 of houston 
said after agreeing to the settlement wednesday 
intermittent wipers now standard or optional equipment on 
nearly all cars sold in the united states automatically start and 
stop at intervals 
kearns is claiming in separate lawsuits that 19 automakers 
infringed on his patents for the intermittent wipers the inventor 
patented the device in 1967 and shopped them around to automakers 
he started the lawsuits 12 years ago 
i dont think the goal was the magnitude of the money 
kearns said what i saw as my role was to defend the patent 
system if i dont go further there really isnt a patent 
system 
chrysler corp may be the next defendant up for trial but a 
spokesman indicated the automaker may settle 
because of the ford settlement were encouraged that we will 
probably be able to reach agreement with mr kearns without 
extended litigation said tom houston 
originally kearns sought 141 million from ford in july a 
jury ordered ford to pay 52 million plus interest for patent 
infringement for a total of 85 million to 115 million kearns 
appealed the award the settlement came before the appeal could be 
decided 
were pleased to be done with the litigation said ford 
attorney malcolm wheeler we still believe that if we had another 
shot at it the patents would have been held invalid 
bill durkee one of kearns attorneys said ford got away with 
more than they should they made a profit from their 
infringement 
ford motor co dealers have sold an estimated 20 million ford 
lincoln and mercury cars with intermittent wipers after legal 
defense costs the settlement nets kearns 33 cents per car 
if the ford settlement pattern were followed with chryslers 
estimated 13 million cars with intermittent wipers it would work 
out to about 43 million without legal fees 
durkee said chrysler probably would be the next legal target 
durkee said chrysler has agreed not to contest the validity of 
kearns patents an argument that took up time in the ford trial 
kearns had claimed he installed a set of intermittent wipers on 
a ford and took it to the automaker kearns a professor at wayne 
state university in detroit at the time said he was led to believe 
ford would buy his invention by the number of questions engineers 
asked 
when that failed to happen he sued 
kearns said he plans to pay off some legal debts and perhaps 
buy a house in texas and hell continue the legal battles to 
protect his patent 
they lawyers are running a business he said im 
running a cause

is there a movement under way to keep 
pete rose out of the hall of fame 
some members of a committee recently formed to review the halls 
eligibility guidelines certainly think so one committee member 
called the action taken by the hall of fame a little 
suspicious and another said its a thinly veiled attempt to 
keep rose out 
william guilfoile the halls associate director said a 
ninemember panel of baseball executives and writers will meet in 
december or january to look at the way the writers and veterans 
selection committees choose hall of famers 
the timing of the move raised suspicions among the baseball 
writers association of america whose 450 members elect players to 
the hall rose the games alltime hit leader is eligible for 
election in 1992 five years after his last game as a player 
weve been voting since 1935 and there have never been 
questions about the way weve been conducting our elections jack 
lang executive secretary of the bwaa said wednesday suddenly 
a year before pete rose comes up for election they want to review 
our process it makes us a little suspicious 
guilfoile said the panel was not being convened exclusively to 
consider the rose case but if someone on the committee wants to 
discuss it im sure they will be able to he said 
sportswriter frank dolson of the philadelphia inquirer selected 
by the sportswriters group to serve on the committee disagreed 
saying the committee is just a thinly veiled attempt to keep rose 
out 
hes eligible in 92 nd you have to ask yourself how it 
would look if they have to give a plaque to someone whos been 
banned from the game dolson said what theyll probably do is 
make it impossible for us to vote on someone whos banned from 
baseball 
rose is serving a prison term in marion ill for cheating on 
his taxes and has been banned from the game for life for gambling 
nothing in the current rules excludes him from being elected to the 
hall of fame guilfoile said 
rose set several records in a 24year career with cincinnati 
montreal and philadelphia including most hits 4256 most 
singles 3215 most games 3562 and most seasons with 200 or 
more hits 10 
he was considered a shooin for the hall until 1989 when 
thencommissioner a bartlett giamatti banned him from the game

chancellor helmut kohl said today that 
germany is ready to send the soviets emergency supplies in case of 
a food crisis and a newspaper said washington is drawing up plans 
to provide food and medical aid 
there is concern that the soviet union could face serious 
shortages of food and other essentials this winter causing extreme 
hardship and possibly provoking civil unrest 
kohl in a speech to parliament said eastern european nations 
also could face severe problems this winter and that he would like 
wealthy industrial states to be ready to help out 
the german leader said that in his talks last weekend with 
soviet president mikhail s gorbachev he promised that germany 
would assist the soviet union financially to the best of our 
powers 
he said germany will be sending a group of highranking 
experts to advise the soviets as they attempt the transition from 
a socialist command economy to a freemarket system 
kohl noted that germany has already promised massive amounts of 
assistance for the soviets so far about 195 billion 
he promised that germany will send emergency shipments of food 
to the soviet union in case of acute supply crises 
the chancellor said that in his talks with president bush this 
sunday at kohls home in oggersheim he will urge that all western 
industrial nations be ready to help out the economically embattled 
former soviet bloc 
i will discuss with president bush how the western industrial 
lands can effectively and jointly support the reform processes in 
eastern europe especially in view of the severe winter standing 
before the reform states said kohl 
britains leading business daily the financial times said 
today that the united states already has made plans to aid the 
soviets 
the times without revealing its sources said that reports this 
week that moscow and leningrad may have to introduce food rationing 
before christmas heightened white house concern about internal 
instability in the soviet union 
the paper said us officials have spoken with allies about the 
possibility of international humanitarian aid such as food 
medicine and clothing this winter but that the means of 
coordinating the effort remains unresolved 
in his speech kohl appealed for people who were east germans 
until last month the have patience with the huge presence of red 
army troops that are to be pulled out over the next few years 
we want the soviet soldiers and their families to feel good 
during their remaining time here said kohl 
there has been growing intolerance for the troops among germans 
in the eastern part of the country in addition there are reports 
of rising crime and desertion among the soviet soldiers 
the soviets have agreed to withdraw their army in eastern 
germany by 1994

mccully said he and others were told by a representative of 
securex the kentucky security firm that recruited them your job 
is to get documentation on film of union members breaking your 
necks

palestinians flew their outlawed national flag 
from rooftops today and marched through villages chanting 
antiisraeli slogans defiantly celebrating the second anniversary 
of their declaration of independence 
army curfews covered most of the gaza strip and more than half 
of the west bank confining more than 1 million palestinians to 
their homes 
the army closed all schools and declared the gaza strip and all 
west bank cities sealed military areas to keep journalists out 
for the past two days soldiers have fired tear gas and rubber 
bullets to break up marches and demonstrations that were held early 
in anticipation of the curfews they also reportedly carried out 
widespread arrests of activists 
the underground leadership of the nearly 3yearold palestinian 
uprising called for three days of celebrations starting today 
they mark the declaration of independence issued nov 15 1988 by 
the parliamentinexile of the palestine liberation organization 
in the west bank village of tamoun nationalist songs sounded 
from a loudspeaker in the main square we will challenge the army 
and its tanks with our war of the knive and the war of the 
street one lyric said 
twelve masked activists wearing black and khaki uniforms marched 
through the village they brandished knives unfurled palestinian 
flags and sprayed graffiti 
the proplo leadership of the uprising allowed shops to stay 
open all day during the celebrations giving respite to a 
population worn down by the numerous general strikes that are part 
of the intefadeh or uprising 
many cars flew balloons in the palestinian national colors army 
radio said 
in bethlehem one of the few west bank towns not under curfew 
palestinian flags fluttered from rooftops near the church of the 
nativity where tradition says jesus was born shoppers crowded the 
outdoor market taking advantage of allday shopping 
the independence declaration which implied recognition of 
israel gave palestinians in the occupied lands a psychological 
boost but brought few changes in their daily lives 
the declaration was recognized by arab and many third world 
countries but rejected by israel and western nations 
army radio reported that in the past week troops raided more 
than 400 west bank villages and arrested scores of palestinians 
seen as potential inciters 
an army official said the report was exaggerated 
certainly there was an effort to go into many villages over 
the past couple of months to look for wanted people said the 
official speaking on condition of anonymity 
but i dont know anything about the army going into 400 
villages he said 
the official said the army viewed widespread curfews as the most 
effective way of preventing violence and insisted they were not 
collective punishment 
curfews are not intended to wear down the population that 
type of claim could have been made two years ago but that is not 
at all the case today he said 
troops dynamited three homes in gazas bureij refugee camp of 
palestinians suspected of participating in the stoning death of an 
israeli soldier in the fall the demolitions brought to 15 the 
number of houses destroyed as punishment for the soldiers killing 
during the uprising the army has destroyed or sealed more than 
500 palestinian homes to punish uprising suspects western 
countries and international organizations have condemned the tactic 
as a human rights violation 
at least 773 palestinians have been killed by israeli soldiers 
or civilians in the uprising which began dec 8 1987 
fiftytwo israelis have died in the violence 
in addition 299 palestinians have been killed by fellow arabs 
most on suspicion of collaboration

the man who tried to shoot at soviet leaders 
during last weeks revolution day parade had been planning to kill 
president mikhail s gorbachev for more than two years soviet news 
reports said today 
alexander a shmonov a 38yearold unemployed man from 
leningrad was charged with attempted terrorism in the nov 7 
shooting on red square 
police say shmonov managed to fire two shots but was prevented 
by police from targeting gorbachev and other soviet leaders who 
were observing the traditional military parade from atop lenins 
mausoleum no one was hurt 
col pyotr sokolov a top kgb investigator told the newspaper 
glasnost that a body search of shmonov turned up a note confirming 
that gorbachev was his intended victim 
the note was prepared in advance in case of his death during 
the assassination attempt sokolov was quoted as saying in a tass 
news agency report of the interview in the note shmonov 
explicitly set out his criminal intentions as regards to the soviet 
president 
according to glasnost the shooting took place just 46 yards 
from the mausoleum police said an officer had noticed shmonov 
pulling out a hunting rifle and aim at the soviet leaders on the 
mausoleum 
the officer forced the gun barrel skyward before shmonov fired 
the two shots he was then grabbed by more security men 
shmonov said he had been preparing this assassination attempt 
for more than two years sokolov told the newspaper during 
that time he acquired an imported doublebarreled hunting rifle 
and practiced rapid firing 
another newspaper rabochaya trybuna said shmonov had a hunting 
license and bought the weapon legally for 1600 
he went to a public library to read about the correct way to 
prepare a cartridge and asked some questions of hunters who were in 
the store the newspaper said 
to carry the gun into red square he sawed off the butt and 
fixed a kind of pocket made of rubbery material inside his 
jacket the report said quoting an official in the state 
prosecutors office 
the newspaper said shmonov who is being held in a kgb 
investigation ward arrived in moscow on nov 6 and rented an 
apartment 
the owner told him it wouldnt be easy to get into red square 
so he spent the night reading newspapers describing meeting places 
for people participating in the parade the newspaper said 
sgt andrei mylnikov the policeman who subdued shmonov during 
the shooting said in an interview with moscow news on wednesday 
that the gunman told investigators i wanted to kill gorbachev 
shmonov joined a delegation from the bauman region during the 
parade marking the 73rd anniversary of the 1917 bolshevik 
revolution 
the shooting took place five minutes after gorbachev yeltsin 
and other officials returned to the mausoleum after marching with 
procommunist demonstrators 
the last reported attempt to assassinate a soviet leader was in 
1969 when a red army officer tried to kill party chief leonid 
brezhnev 
the gunman lt viktor ilyin missed and killed a chauffeur and 
wounded three other people he spent 21 years in a psychiatric 
hospital and was released in february

people as it swept across the central philippine islands 
cebu the countrys second major port city remained without 
drinking water telephones and electricity two days after the storm 
struck said sen john osmena who returned from the stricken area 
350 miles southeast of manila 
nearly 50 passenger cargo and philippine navy ships sank during 
the storm most of them in cebus port typhoon mikes ferocious 
winds also blew a panamanian cargo ship causing it to slam into 
the mactan bridge and making it unpassable to truckloads of 
supplies in and out of the city 
its like we were hit by an atomic bomb osmena said after 
returning to manila there is not a single electric pole nor tree 
still standing up everything was blown down 
osmena complained that there has been no help from the central 
government despite president corazon aquinos declaration of a 
state of calamity in cebu and other provinces

a man who claimed he had a bomb 
hijacked a soviet airliner to finland today and surrendered without 
incident to authorities most of the passengers slept through the 
ordeal 
it was at least the seventh time a soviet jet was commandeered 
to scandinavia this year by young soviet men trying to flee their 
country 
finnish police said the 31yearold hijacker who turned out to 
be unarmed offered no resistance at helsinki airport and asked for 
political asylum 
none of the aeroflot jets 65 passengers or six crew members was 
injured two americans were among the 15 westerners aboard the 
plane 
everything was very quiet when we left leningrad at 5 am and 
i had no idea we had been hijacked until i saw flashing lights and 
police cars outside on the runway said jack mclaughlin a 
businessman from boston 
i did see a young fella in red sneakers going up and down the 
aisle a couple of times but he looked no different from any normal 
passenger said charles erven of racine wis 
most people were asleep anyway so we didnt really know what 
was going on until after we landed he said 
police said the soviet man hijacked the twinengine tupolev 134 
while on a flight from leningrad to moscow threatening to explode 
a plastic bomb 
criminal police inspector pertti lehtonen said in an interview 
that the hijacker had demanded to go to stockholm sweden it was 
not immediately clear why the plane landed in helsinki instead at 
530 am 
lehtonen said the western passengers had been heading for moscow 
to make international flight connections 
substitute flights were arranged in helsinki and most of the 
nonsoviet passengers had left by midday the americans were 
heading for prague 
we were very fortunate i guess things could have turned 
out really differently erven said 
lehtonen said the soviet passengers and crew members would take 
the tupolev to moscow after police questioned them 
erven and mclaughlin said they did not know about the repeated 
hijackings of planes to finland and sweden this year by young men 
trying to flee the soviet union i was in a rush and would not 
have taken the train in any case mclaughlin said

firefighters hoped lighter winds and 
lower temperatures would linger long enough to help them battle a 
34000acre timber and grass fire near the missouri river 
about two dozen hunters fled their backcountry camps late 
tuesday when the windwhipped fire raged through the remote gates 
of the mountains wilderness and adjacent beartooth game range in 
western montana 
lorraine parrish a spokeswoman at the interagency dispatch 
center near helena said the wind died down unexpectedly wednesday 
and snow was falling on some areas of the fire 
the fire broke out late tuesday in the rugged big belt mountains 
about 35 miles northeast of helena officials said recordhigh 
temperatures extremely dry conditions and winds as high as 30 mph 
helped the fire spread before the situation improved wednesday 
gov stan stephens on wednesday called out the national guard to 
help the 400 firefighters and support personnel fight the blaze 
the cause hasnt been pinpointed but officials think the blaze 
may have started in a hunting camp 
lewis and clark county authorities said all the hunters known to 
have been in the area were accounted for and no injuries had been 
reported 
several hunters at the elkhorn creek campsite had no time to 
leave and spent several hours lying in a creek waiting for the 
flames to pass 
others fled on horseback leaving behind most of their 
belongings and spent the night trying to keep ahead of the blaze 
we had a big fire going behind us to lighten things up said 
hunter gary phillipe that baby it was like a full moon 
butch hestekin of great falls said a wall of flames just 
whipped across the tops of the trees at his hunting camp in the 
rush to save their lives hestekins hunting party abandoned five 
pickups and all their belongings 
the cinders were falling on us said lynn dumas another 
hunter we had five minutes warning just about enough time to 
saddle a horse 
at least 30 homes were evacuated east of wolf creek and the 
fire got within about two miles of the small town of craig which 
is protected by the missouri river

president mikhail s gorbachev is prepared for a 
political battle when he addresses the legislature on friday but 
is confident his views will prevail the leader of italys 
communist party says 
achille occhetto who met for 2 hours with the soviet leader 
said today that gorbachev was candid about the problems both 
economic and political facing the country and predicted that the 
next 18 months would be crucial to the program of perestroika as 
gorbachevs reform program is called 
on wednesday angry members of the national legislature 
abandoned the agenda set by the supreme soviets presidium and took 
to the floor with demands that gorbachev report to them on his 
attempts to hold the country together and his recent meeting with 
russian federation president boris n yeltsin 
after 362 legislators out of 378 present voted in support of the 
demand gorbachev agreed to address the supreme soviet on friday 
tass said 
i feel gorbachev is selfconfident and ready for political 
battle occhetto told reporters i feel he will be the master 
of the situation 
occhetto said that gorbachev told him that the next 18 months 
would be extremely important for his economic and political reforms 
and play a decisive role in the future of the country 
tass in a political commentary said fridays speech was 
tantamount to a moment of truth and that gorbachev would most 
likely offer specific remedies to put new life into the moribund 
economy 
will gorbachev justify the expectations the official news 
agency said the most radicalminded critics express doubt on 
that score pointing out that gorbachev a consumate master at 
subtle multioption moves lacks resoluteness when hard decisions 
need to be made 
on the other hand tass said gorbachev is making some headway 
in his reform program given the many vital tasks that he must 
perform including time consuming foreign affairs and domestic 
disputes with the restive republics

the risk to health care workers exposed to 
aids through cuts is low but nine of 10 people who receive 
aidstained blood through transfusions will become infected by the 
deadly virus two studies say 
the studies compare the minuscule amount transmitted through a 
needle puncture to the relatively high amount of the aids virus 
found in blood transfusions 
in one study researchers found that 90 percent of 124 people 
who received tainted transfusions became infected with hiv the 
aids virus within three years 13 percent developed aids 
researchers said 
in a second study scientists reported that health care workers 
had a 056 percent chance of infection after they were injured and 
exposed to the aids virus 
the studies are published in todays annals of internal 
medicine 
as of october 154917 americans had contracted aids of those 
3826 or 24 percent were infected through transfusions three of 
37 health care workers infected through occupational exposure have 
developed the disease said the federal centers for disease 
control 
for up to four years researchers tracked recipients of blood 
later found tainted by the aids virus 
of the 111 who became infected nine have developed aids three 
died almost half received transfusions for surgery 
its important not to have any illusions about how infectious 
hiv is if its there in the transfusion youll get it said 
the studys lead author dr elizabeth donegan of the university of 
california at san francisco 
today experts estimate one in 150000 units of blood is 
contaminated with aids 
the risk to healthcare workers is much smaller according to 
the second study of the 1344 national institutes of health 
workers reporting 179 cuts or punctures over six years only one 
became infected said the study by nih and johns hopkins 
university 
the study said 243 workers were exposed to the aids virus 
usually through splashes of patient fluids to the mouth or eyes 
none has shown signs of infection 
there is a risk but you have to keep that risk in 
perspective said the studys lead author dr david henderson of 
the nih 
health care workers who have begun wearing gloves masks and 
gowns for certain procedures should continue to do so henderson 
said 
and while health care officials may find the low risk 
reassuring they should not make light of those workers who fear 
the risk 
while the risk is small there is some risk and the risk is 
real said aids researcher dr robert klein coauthor of an 
editorial accompanying the two studies

a government commission today ordered the railroad 
ministry to cancel a plan that would have charged passengers hard 
currency rather than rubles for train trips out of the country 
the new pay schedule had been scheduled to begin today the 
policy would have been a hardship for many soviets because the 
official exchange rate makes it difficult for them to afford hard 
currency 
the governments foreign economic commission part of the 
council of ministers said the plan was unfounded and told the 
railroad minister to rescind it a tass report on the development 
gave no further explanation 
the dispute between the two government bodies is another sign of 
the growing dissension in the kremlin 
the railroad ministry had said it would take the step because it 
had to pay foreign companies in hard currency for using their 
railways 
it said it had no foreign currency of its own to pay the bills 
so it was forced to ask passengers to pay in hard currency 
at the same time the state airline aeroflot is considering 
accepting only hard currency for trips abroad

war against iraq could be a lesser evil than 
allowing saddam hussein to get away with his aggression against 
kuwait the archbishop of canterbury said today 
the world faces a very somber situation the archbishop 
robert runcie told the general synod of the state church of 
england 
if it comes to war in the gulf crisis noncombatants will 
most certainly be killed and maimed and bereaved we must set 
aside romantic ideas of a surgical strike said runcie who was a 
tank officer decorated for bravery in world war ii 
he said the economic sanctions on iraq must be given time to 
work but he added despite all the horrors and misery that war 
would certainly involve we have to face the fact that it could be 
the lesser of two evils 
of one thing i am quite sure whilst we must use every means 
short of war to enforce the un policy it would be foolish to 
rule out the use of force in the last resort 
the archbishop spiritual head of the church of england and 
leader of the worlds 70 million anglicans was a scots guards 
officer when he led a tank unit across the rhine and into the 
german heartland in 1945 
he won the coveted military cross for rescuing one of his 
crewmen who was trapped in a burning tank and the next day he blew 
up a german gun emplacement which had knocked out five tanks 
in his presidential address to the synods regular november 
session runcie acknowledged that some members of the synod of 574 
bishops clergy and laity disagreed over whether military action 
against iraq was justifiable 
though war is only rarely just it can be justifiable he 
said 
he said that threatening saddam with a war crimes trial as 
prime minister margaret thatcher has done would not encourage him 
to leave kuwait

countries whose economies are suffering because of their adherence 
to a trade embargo against iraq

resolution as permanent members of the security council they could 
have killed it with their veto

then go to colombia the following weekend to confer with president 
cesar gaviria colombia also is a member of the security council 
this month 
at his news conference wednesday baker said the administration 
had not decided to use force but wanted that hypothetical 
option to be credible in hopes of persuading iraqi president saddam 
hussein to give up kuwait 
saudi arabia egypt bahrain egypt turkey and the exiled 
government of kuwait all assured baker during his recent eightday 
trip to the persian gulf and europe that they would not oppose the 
resolution 
in the meantime king hassan of morocco is trying to organize an 
arab summit to head off war with diplomacy 
we are in favor of any diplomatic approaches that can move us 
in the direction of a political and peaceful settlement baker 
said but we are not in favor of diplomatic approaches that call 
for partial solutions 
baker was referring to the longstanding us demand that iraq 
withdraw its troops unconditionally from kuwait before any 
discussion on related issues are held saudi arabia a key us 
ally against saddam has taken the same position with regard to an 
arab summit

a new law requiring states to suspend the 
drivers licenses of all convicted drug offenders or lose some 
federal highway funds may not help the war on drugs an official of 
the national governors association says 
there is no data proving that mandatory license suspensions 
imposed first in new jersey prompts people to turn away from 
drugs said nolan jones staff director for the associations 
justice and public safety committee 
it sounds like a good idea but lets see if its working 
before forcing every state to enact similar rules jones said 
the measure included in the fiscal 1991 transportation 
appropriations bill applies to all states and all illegal drugs 
including the 10 states where possession of small amounts of 
marijuana has been decriminalized but is still considered an 
infraction of the law 
the legislation drew little attention when it was approved 
during a flurry of activity oct 27 as congress rushed to leave 
town president bush signed it into law nov 5 
the bill calls for withholding 5 percent of federal highway 
funds starting oct 1 1993 from states that fail to require 
sixmonth drivers license suspensions for everyone convicted of 
any drug offense the cut would increase to 10 percent on oct 1 
1995 
numerous states have drivers license revocation laws but 
they dont go as far as this calls for jones said in an 
interview that points to why we are against the whole issue of 
mandates when looking at this sort of problem 
about half the states allow suspension of drug offenders 
licenses but only four require such suspensions for drivers of all 
ages and only new jersey has a sixmonth minimum according to the 
american legislative exchange council the minimum is four months 
in georgia and three months in colorado and pennsylvania 
the legislation does have a way out for states that want all 
their federal highway funds but dont want to require license 
suspensions their legislatures must vote specifically against 
requiring the suspensions and their governors must go on record in 
agreement with that position 
this forces the states to be accountable said a bush 
administration source who spoke on condition of anonymity were 
not going to force you but if you dont want to do it youll have 
to be public about it 
in states where they cant agree for example the governor 
wants to suspend licenses but at least one chamber of the state 
legislature does not the federal highway funds would be cut 
the measures sponsor rep gerald bh solomon rny said 
his main targets were new york and california which have 
decriminalized minor marijuana possession 
both states also have splits in party control in california 
the democrats control the legislature and the governor is a 
republican in new york the governor is a democrat and his party 
controls the state assembly while republicans control the state 
senate 
arnold s trebach president of the drug policy foundation and 
an american university professor of public affairs said the 
measure is only one of many passed during recent antidrug war 
hysteria that is creating a police state in america in the name of 
controlling drugs 
people are soon going to realize that what their legislators 
have created for them under the drug laws is an absolutely 
intolerable situation said trebach whose foundation urges 
treating drug abuse as a medical issue not a law enforcement 
problem 
solomon said he pushed the measure to crack down on casual drug 
users 
seventyfive percent of the drug purchases in america are done 
by casual drug users and thats white uppermiddleclass 
americans that drive their pontiac firebirds into the ghetto and 
buy these killer drugs solomon said 
you dont see the murders take place out in the suburbs but 
its the casual drug user who supplies the demand for these 
drugs he said if you do away with the demand for drugs then 
the drugs will dry up in this country when it starts to affect 
their livelihoods maybe then theyll stop using these drugs 
the license suspensions wont necessarily affect their 
livelihoods however because they could receive limited permits 
enabling them to continue commuting to work solomon said 
the money at stake is substantial 
the federal highway administration will distribute some 123 
billion to the states this year of that total california will get 
the biggest slice some 11 billion new york will get 666 
million

a minor earthquake shook pictures off 
walls in two central oklahoma communities early today but experts 
said there was no connection with a potential major quake on the 
new madrid fault 
the oklahoma geological survey said the quake registered 36 on 
the richter scale of ground movement a quake of magnitude 35 can 
cause slight damage a quake of magnitude 2 is the smallest 
normally felt by humans 
the national weather service said it had received reports of a 
tremor about 545 am that was felt in rush springs about 40 
miles southwest of oklahoma city and lindsay about 28 miles south 
of oklahoma city the geological survey said the quake was centered 
5 miles north of lindsay 
police departments in those areas indicate that pictures fell 
from walls objects were knocked off tables and out of cabinets and 
many residents were awakened the weather service said in a 
statement 
geological survey director charles mankin said earthquakes are 
common in oklahoma with a couple a week detected by sensitive 
seismographs 
we rarely record them as high as 36 he said but a small 
earthquake in that area is not unusual 
larry thompson of kblp radio in lindsay said the station was 
flooded with calls after the tremor was felt 
at the police department dispatcher lois knapp said the shaking 
lasted about two seconds 
this police department is cement and brick and rock and it 
moved she said 
there has been increased concern about a midwestern earthquake 
since a new mexico climatologist projected that there could be a 
major one in early december along the new madrid fault which runs 
from cairo ill to marked tree ark the projection based on the 
fact that tidal forces will be particularly strong early next 
month is disputed by most scientists 
mankin said there was no link between todays quake and the new 
madrid fault 
most of the earthquakes in oklahoma we have not been able to 
relate to faults mankin said theyre very shallow earthquakes 
and we know theyre from some ground adjustment obviously but we 
cant relate them to some fault 
in 18111812 a series of quakes estimated at up to 8 on the 
richter scale struck the new madrid fault ringing church bells in 
washington dc more than 850 miles away 
jim lawson chief geophysicist at the geological survey said 
earlier this week that even if a major quake occurred along the new 
madrid fault its effect in oklahoma would be negligible

us and saudi forces today began a sixday amphibious exercise 
in the persian gulf codenamed imminent thunder and involving 
1000 us marines 1100 aircraft and 16 ships 
iraq has termed the exercise a provocative act because it is 
being held close to occupied kuwait 
also today syria and egypt rejected a proposed arab summit on 
the persian gulf crisis effectively killing chances for the 
gathering that moroccos king said was possibly the last chance for 
peace 
presidents hafez assad of syria and hosni mubarak of egypt 
became the latest arab leaders to join saudi arabia in rejecting 
the summit they said they were doing so because baghdad insisted 
upon keeping kuwait 
saudi arabia said on wednesday it would not participate in the 
summit unless baghdad promised beforehand to leave kuwait which it 
invaded aug 2 
in other developments 
two american diplomats arrived in amman jordan on todays 
regularly scheduled flight from baghdad the state department said 
on wednesday two americans were to leave iraq but did not release 
their identities or further details 
im not a hostage said one who was carrying an orange bag 
that looked like a diplomatic pouch two other americans arrived 
from iraq on wednesday 
hundreds of americas most powerful tanks began rolling into 
the saudi desert adding more power to the growing us deployment 
in saudi arabia as washington seeks un authorization to wage war 
on iraq 
a poll sponsored by an armscontrol group found that most 
americans oppose going to war without a congressional declaration 
and nearly half prefer to give a unordered embargo on trade with 
iraq more time 
the state iraqi news agency announced that president bush will 
go on trial in absentia next month in algeria for inhuman 
policies and planning aggression against the people of iraq 
the trial will begin dec 10 in algiers in an international 
court of justice ina said it quoted the secretarygeneral of the 
arab jurists federation shibeeb almaliky as saying the trial 
would be held in accordance with rules used by the nuremberg courts 
that tried nazi war criminals 
the exact location of imminent thunder was not revealed because 
of military policy and a news blackout was imposed for the initial 
phases of the operation 
no live ammuniton will be fired in the operation but it will 
involve the largest use of aircraft in a single training exercise 
since us forces were deployed in the region in august 
there have been three previous amphibious exercises in the 
persian gulf but they were believed to have been held further 
south the washington times reported on wednesday that imminent 
thunder would be held 10 miles from kuwait iraq called that a 
provocation 
the first of several hundred khakicolored m1a1 abrams tanks to 
be repainted in desert camouflage rolled off a ship in saudi 
arabia on wednesday night the tanks will replace m1 tanks in all 
frontline army units in the country with better protection from 
chemical and biological warfare a larger gun and thicker armor 
they will face iraqs sovietmade tanks 
the m1 is better than anything the iraqis have said army 
spokesman maj douglas bidle 38 of arlington heights ill the 
m1 gave us an edge this is a better tank so obviously this is an 
even better edge 
janes defense weekly reported last month that 350 m1s would be 
swapped for m1a1s the pentagon has said all tanks will be switched 
by the end of the year 
about 230000 us troops have massed in the region joined by 
about 100000 soldiers from more than two dozen other nations 
standing up to iraq 
the iraqi foreign minister tariq aziz on wednesday accused the 
united states of seeking to dominate the world oil market 
the main us objective in the region is to control oil wells 
and dictate oil policies the official iraqi news agency quoted 
aziz as saying 
secretary of state james a baker iii said tuesday that a 
worldwide recession could result if iraq is permitted to gain 
control of the persian gulfs vast oil reserves 
last week baker won qualified support from the soviet union 
china and france for a un resolution authorizing the use of 
force to drive iraqi forces from kuwait they are permanent members 
of the security council with britain and the united states and as 
such could veto any resolution 
chinese diplomatic sources said last week the chinese foreign 
minister visiting baghdad told iraqi officials china would not 
veto a resolution authorizing force 
but today the chinese foreign ministry said it had not told 
baghdad how it would vote it said the issue was not even raised 
it was not clear whether the chinese government was simply 
unwilling to show its hand in keeping with its usual policy or 
whether the diplomatic sources were incorrect 
some congressional democrats are counseling bush to give 
international sanctions as much as 18 months before considering an 
attack 
the new poll sponsored by the professionals coalition for 
nuclear arms control indicates most americans are opposed to going 
to war even if the standoff has not changed by january 
it found that 62 percent of the 1020 people interviewed approve 
of bushs handling of the crisis but that 71 percent think 
congress must approve sending us troops into battle 
the national telephone survey found that 44 percent favor 
continuing the economic sanctions even if the situation remains 
unresolved by february fourteen percent favored a us withdrawal 
thirtyeight percent believe the united states should attack 
iraq 
the survey conducted friday through tuesday had a margin of 
error of 3 percentage points

a summary of the christian heritage in america 
was modified by us roman catholic bishops today to recognize 
abuses that occurred in the early days 
the document heritage and hope evangelization in america 
was drawn up to mark next years 500th anniversary of christopher 
columbus landing on these shores 
archbishop edward a mccarthy of miami head of a committee that 
drafted the pastoral letter commemorating the coming of europeans 
to america said it has undergone major revisions 
it deals with concerns of native americans hispanics blacks 
asians he said adding that putting it together has been a 
learning experience 
we do not glorify every act of the church he said we do 
not excuse our mistakes but the document also brings out 
christianitys positive contributions in early america 
mccarthy said it is urgent that the positive side be heard in 
marking the anniversary he told the annual meeting of the national 
conference of catholic bishops 
already strong forces have gathered to characterize 
christianity in the ugliest terms while the reality of the churchs 
commitment in the americas is unparalleled in the annals of human 
history 
for good or bad our history is as it was but the future 
opens before us and beckons us to bring christ into generations 
born and unborn 
the bishops yesterday adopted their first comprehensive 
guidelines on human sexuality calling it a wonderful gift and 
emphasizing chaste disciplines to nurture it 
we do not fear sexuality we embrace it the bishops said in 
both lauding that universal human endowment and reaffirming 
traditional church restraints in expressing it 
in the 185page assessment of sexuality approved wednesday to 
guide education on the subject the national conference of catholic 
bishops added 
we are dealing with a divine gift a primal dimension of each 
person a mysterious blend of spirit and body which shares in 
gods own creative love and life 
what we fear at times is our own inability to think as highly 
of the gift as does the god who made us sexual human beings 
while maintaining longestablished church disapproval of 
premarital and extramarital sexual intercourse the document does 
so in gentle reasoned tones and somewhat tempers past strictures 
against homosexuality 
such an orientation because not freely chosen is not 
sinful said an amendment added in a motion by cardinal joseph 
bernardin of chicago and several others 
it came after bishop raymond w lessard of savannah ga sought 
unsuccessfully to insert a 1986 vatican declaration calling 
homosexuality a strong tendency toward intrinsic moral evil 
and an objective disorder 
archbishop john r quinn of san francisco called that a 
philosophical analysis that has been misunderstood as meaning such 
people were intrinsically disordered and bad 
every human being has some disordered tendency such as 
toward anger and greed quinn said 
the vatican statement was put in a footnote along with an 
explanation that it was not meant to demean individuals it has 
caused untold damage pushing many over the brink to confront 
the church headon said auxiliary bishop peter a rosazza of 
hartford conn 
another flurry erupted over the documents reiteration of the 
church ban on contraception surveys indicate that a large 
proportion of catholics reject the ban 
bishop kenneth e untener of saginaw mich noting that 
dissenters are asked to prayerfully reconsider said they might 
respond we will if you will 
he said the holy spirit acts through people the sense of the 
faithful and the bishops had better listen to them to maintain the 
churchs credibility if we dont it will cause great damage to 
the church at large he said 
several bishops sharply criticized the guidelines saying 
parents had not been widely consulted and predicting that many 
would pull their children out of catholic schools because of them

pilot error is suspected in the crash 
of an italian jetliner trying to land at zurichs international 
airport killing all 46 people aboard including six americans 
authorities said today 
the alitalia dc9 arriving on a 50minute flight from milan 
skimmed treetops before its fiery crash into a wooded hillside on 
wednesday night five miles short of kloten airport police said 
josef meier a spokesman for swiss air traffic control 
authorities told a news conference that witness accounts suggested 
several causes for the crash and that no possible theories 
including terrorism were being ruled out 
but meier said radar data suggest the pilot misjudged his 
altitude he said the plane was flying about 1000 feet below the 
normal altitude during the landing approach 
he said the plane was not yet within reach of an airport radar 
beacon enabling it to lock onto a landing path 
radio contact was normal until two minutes before the crash and 
controllers received no distress signal officials said 
the swiss federal meteorological office said visibility at the 
time of the crash was good up to 10 miles with light rain and 
light winds 
investigators reported finding one of the two flight recorders 
or black boxes which track flight data and cockpit 
conversations and hoped to learn more about the crashs cause from 
them 
about 300 police and rescuers worked at the muddy crash site 
today salvaging wreckage and retrieving charred bodies for 
identification 
officials said all 40 passengers and six italian crew members 
were killed in rome a preliminary count by the airline said six 
us citizens were among the dead but the passenger list it 
released gave only last names and first initials without 
nationalities 
the jet cut a swath into the forest and broke up on impact 
witnesses said smoking pieces of wreckage covered with 
firefighting foam were strewn around a muddy hillside 
the plane was burning like a volcano said hanni steffen a 
resident and medic who rushed to the crash site 
debris was strewn over an area of 50 by 120 yards police said 
alitalia identified the american victims as karel forman 
stephen ritter john stuckey paul vaughan william briggs and 
jerry bass it had no further information 
three of the americans worked for the mobil corp in macedon 
ny briggs 52 of newark forman 32 of clifton springs ny 
and vaughan 38 of fairport ny the company provided their ages 
and hometowns 
a team of italian investigators sent by interior minister 
vincenzo scotti arrived early today to help in the inquiry at 
linate airport in milan where the flight originated officials set 
up a crisis unit to provide information and take calls from worried 
families and friends 
alitalia said the dc9 was built in 1974 and was last inspected 
nov 4 
flight commander raffaele liberta 47 was a 20year alitalia 
veteran who had flown more than 10000 hours during his career 
the last major crash involving an italian airliner occurred oct 
15 1987 when an atr42 turboprop of the carrier ati an alitalia

lebanons most influential shiite moslem 
cleric renewed his appeal today for the release of all hostages 
held in lebanon calling their detention inhumane 
sheik mohammed hussein fadlallah spiritual mentor of the 
iranianbacked hezbollah or party of god spoke to reporters after 
meeting the relatives of four iranians missing in lebanon 
the fundamentalist hezbollah is believed to be the umbrella for 
the shiite extremist factions holding most of the 13 western 
hostages in lebanon including six americans 
fadlallah made several such statements in the past that appeared 
to have had no immediate impact on the kidnappers despite the 
weight of his religious position 
however when a group calling itself the organization of islamic 
dawn released former american hostages robert polhill and frank 
reed in april it said its reasons included the behests of senior 
religious leaders 
the longestheld hostage is terry anderson chief middle east

a federal judge today sentenced jose dionisio 
suarez esquivel to 12 years in prison for conspiring to assassinate 
onetime chilean ambassador orlando letelier 
suarez admitted in september that he gave a blasting cap to 
former chilean intelligence agent michael v townley who allegedly 
masterminded the assassination 
letelier and an associate ronni moffitt were killed sept 21 
1976 when a bomb exploded beneath his car on embassy row 
letelier chiles ambassador to washington from 1971 to 1973 was 
an outspoken critic of the rightwing military government of gen 
augusto pinochet 
defense attorney paul goldberger asked the judge to show some 
leniency in sentencing suarez noting that he has a wife and an 
infant son this is not the type of case in which the parole 
board would give him an early parole goldberger said 
but us district judge aubrey robinson jr said the victims 
should be remembered 
i could not forget them robinson said dont think his 
leteliers family didnt love him any less i also could nt 
forget ronni moffit and her husband 
under a plea agreement approved by robinson suarez 51 faced a 
maximum 12 years in prison for his role in the crime under the 
agreement authorities dropped charges against elizabeth gongora 
suarez his wife of concealing a fugitive officials said 
goldberger argued that townley the alleged mastermind behind 
the plot received only 10 years and former chilean army maj 
armando fernandez larios received just seven years goldberger told 
the court it would not be fair to give suarez more time than the 
others 
fernandez defected from chile in 1987 and pleaded guilty to 
being an accessory after the fact in the conspiracy fernandez 
implicated two of his superiors in the chilean intelligence agency 
and pinochet in the coverup of the chilean militarys involvement 
in the crime 
the two chilean military officials have been charged with 
participating in the killing but the chilean government has refused 
to extradite the men 
pinochet remains head of the chilean army and military courts 
have jurisdiction over the two officials gen juan manuel 
contreras sepulveda and retired lt col pedro espinoza bravo the 
former head of the chilean intelligence agency 
outside the courtroom goldberger said the appropriate 
sentence would have been no more than townley got however he 
added that robinson was a fair judge who merely decided on the 
maximum prison term

nigerian jets from a west african 
task force bombed liberias rebelheld port of buchanan and the 
rebels said several people were killed and a us relief ship 
destroyed 
nigerian ambassador joshua iroha the chief political 
representative of a fivenation west african army in liberia 
confirmed wednesdays bombing he said the raid was to stop weapons 
shipments to rebels led by charles taylor 
the task force is not obliged to tell anyone when it is 
carrying out military operations and whoever was at the port of 
buchanan when the bombing was carried out was just unlucky iroha 
said in an interview 
there are more weapons in the containers at the port of 
buchanan than food any international relief organization that 
wants to help liberians must use the free port of monrovia he 
said at his base in freetown 
the us ship was carrying relief supplies of food it was not 
immediately known how many people were aboard the ship or what 
happened to them 
the west africans have forced taylors rebels out of monrovia 
where there are between 150000 and 200000 civilians most people 
in liberia are behind the lines of taylors guerrillas and 
buchanan has the largest concentration of civilians after monrovia 
humanitarian organizations like the us catholic relief 
services and the belgian branch of doctors without borders have 
been working on both sides to aid people dying of starvation 
disease and lately from the west african bombing raids 
three warring liberian armies have killed about 10000 civilians 
since rebels invaded from ivory coast on dec 23 more than half of 
the population of 23 million has fled the country or is displaced 
inside liberia 
it was not possible to get independent confirmation of the 
casualties in wednesdays bombing

the quake measured 52 on the richter scale according to leo 
bautista a spokesman of the philippine institute of volcanology 
and seismology she said the epicenter was about 31 miles northeast 
of manila 
an earthquake that measured 77 on the richter scale on the same 
fault line the philippine fault line killed nearly 1700 people 
and caused widespread destruction in the northern philippines in 
july 
the richter scale is a gauge of the energy released by an 
earthquake as measured by the ground motion recorded on a 
seismograph every increase of one digit means the ground motion is 
10 times greater a magnitude of 6 can cause severe damage in 
populated areas

two opinion polls published today indicate the 
general public prefers michael heseltine over margaret thatcher 
but the prime minister said that after 11 years in office she is 
not intimidated by his challenge 
speaking in the house of commons mrs thatcher attacked 
heseltines proposals for education funding and expressed 
confidence that she would win the leadership vote on tuesday if 
she does she remains prime minister if heseltine does he takes 
over the top job 
paddy ashdown leader of the small liberal democratic party 
teased the prime minister by holding up a 5yearold newspaper 
interview headlined maggie ill go in five years 
what made her change her mind ashdown asked 
mrs thatcher said 
i confess that that wasnt the foremost thought in my mind at 
this present time after three general election victories 
leading the only party with clear policies resolutely carried out 
i intend to continue 
heseltine a former defense secretary is the first serious 
challenger to mrs thatcher since she became conservative party 
leader in 1975 and prime minister in 1979 
zeroing in on heseltines proposal that the national government 
assume the costs of education she said that would either mean a 
huge increase in income tax or a substantial reduction in monies 
available for other services 
two opinion polls published in newspapers today showed that 
heseltine was more popular than mrs thatcher with the general 
public 
however one poll published in the guardian newspaper showed 
that mrs thatcher is still the overwhelming favorite of 
conservative party voters 
heseltine who submitted his nomination papers to party 
officials this morning argues he is more likely to lead the 
conservatives to victory in the next general election which must 
be held by mid1992 
a poll of 1084 people published in the independent newspaper 
showed the conservatives trailing labor by 14 percentage points 
with mrs thatcher at the helm but when the poll asked how people 
would vote if heseltine were conservative leader the gap shrank to 
five points 
the poll conducted wednesday by national opinion polls had a 
margin of error of plus or minus three percent 
the guardian which polled 1446 people found that heseltine 
was favored when respondents of all political stripes were 
questioned but that mrs thatcher came out ahead when only 
conservatives were asked 
heseltine was the first choice of 29 percent of the whole 
sample four points ahead of mrs thatcher among conservatives 
however mrs thatcher was chosen by 59 percent to heseltines 18 
percent 
the poll underlines the cruel choice facing tory mps the 
guardian reported if they vote to keep mrs thatcher they will 
persevere with a leader who among the electorate attracts much the 
greater hostility of any contender if they ditch her they will 
deeply disappoint many committed supporters 
the margin of error for the poll conducted last weekend by 
international communication marketing research ltd was not 
reported 
a third poll of 240 of the 373 conservative lawmakers taken 
between monday and today by press association the british news 
agency found that heseltine faces defeat tuesday 
press association forecast that mrs thatcher would win 533 
percent of the vote and heseltine would get 192 percent but 275 
percent of the members of parliament questioned refused to reveal 
their positions

premier li peng has called for emergency measures 
to handle grain overflowing storage spaces after chinas record 
harvest an official report said thursday 
li urged the mobilization of all social forces and 
suggested building new permanent storage facilities putting up 
temporary grain storage tents and renting warehouses and empty 
buildings from other enterprises 
the official chinese media have reported for months that 
mountains of grain have been left out to rot throughout the 
country 
official statistics indicate that 30 million to 40 million tons 
of grain representing 7 percent to 9 percent of this years 
harvest is unsheltered because of a severe shortage of granaries 
and other storage space 
at the moment the lack of granaries is a glaring problem the 
grain departments alone cannot solve this problem a report on 
the front page of the peoples daily paraphrased li as telling 
local officials at a national conference on grain production in 
beijing on wednesday 
li also said farmers should be encouraged to find ways of 
storing their own grain 
more than half of chinas granaries are over 20 years old the 
government says it plans to build new grain depots capable of 
storing 25 million tons of grain over the next five years 
already this year the state has allocated 126 million to build 
granaries to store 8 million tons of grain official reports said 
storage is only one problem created by the bumper crop which is 
expected to top 462 million tons chinas largest previous grain 
harvest was 407 million tons in 1984 
farmers also are confronting low prices and in some cases no 
buyers for their grain 
chinese farmers can sell their harvest on the free market after 
meeting a stateset quota but two consecutive years of bumper 
harvests have caused free market grain prices to drop 
the state has raised its purchasing price for grain but not 
enough to cover the rising costs of fertilizer and other outlays 
to help make up for the drop in the market price the state this 
fall started buying grain in excess of the quota at a slightly 
higher price than it paid for grain due to the state

leaders of the 250000 high school students who 
marched this week for a better education today demanded the 
government immediately spend millions of dollars in an emergency 
fund on the overcrowded school system 
education minister lionel jospin met with a delegation of 20 
students representing the two main moderate and leftist 
organizations that have emerged in four weeks of protests 
delegates said before the talks started that 1 billion that 
premier michel rocard earmarked on wednesday from the 1990 budget 
wouldnt be enough 
leaders of the moderate federation independant des lyceens said 
they would ask for an additional 777 million during the talks 
another organization led by the communist partys youth movement 
also declared a higher sum would be necessary 
both groups basically seek more teachers smaller classes more 
innovative education and better security at schools in tough 
neighborhoods where crime and drugs are growing problems 
a march on monday by 250000 students in paris and the provinces 
deteriorated into widespread vandalism in the capital 
several hundred members of youth gangs exploited the crowd on 
the left bank to break windows loot shops and burn or otherwise 
damage 190 cars 
at least 140 police officers were injured in rock and teargas 
battles with the rioters special courts on wednesday jailed or 
fined 53 youths arrested during the incident 
though jospin and president francois mitterrand promised monday 
to take steps to meet student demands their leaders have vowed to 
keep up pressure until concrete measures are approved 
the students plan to stage what they hope will be a peaceful 
sitin friday before the national asssembly they had earlier 
planned a march but changed their tactics after mondays rioting 
the marches and accompanying violence are putting pressure on 
rocards government which already faces a noconfidence test next 
week over plans to reform social security 
his quick cash injection targeted specifically at high schools 
will add an extra 444 million dollars to this years 20 billion 
budget deficit 
the students won broad public support as accounts emerged of 
graffitiscarred high schools with holes in the roofs exposed 
wires shortages of desks violence against teachers and pupils 
extortion and drug use 
the marches began last month after a student was raped in a 
lavatory in the gritty paris suburb of st ouen most of the nearly 
daily protests have been peaceful

president bush met today with leaders of some 
of the nations largest corporations and banks as part of a series 
of private sessions to help him gauge whether the economy is in a 
recession 
the president is trying to decide what steps he might be able to 
take to help soften the impact of the current slowdown said a 
white house official 
the official speaking on the condition of anonymity said 
todays meeting follows a meeting on wednesday between the 
president and bank regulators and administration economic 
officials 
john g medlin jr president and chief executive officer of the 
first wachovia corp said that the group of executives gave bush a 
generally gloomy assessment of the economy with many expressing the 
belief that the country has either slipped into a recession or is 
on the verge of a downturn 
medlin said that bush gave no indications of what the 
administration may be proposing in an effort to lessen the severity 
of any downturn and spent most of the session listening to what the 
business executives had to say in describing economic conditions 
the president just listened he didnt give us his views 
medlin said he was very sincerely looking for views out in the 
real world 
the white house officials said that bush likely will hold 
another meeting with executives on friday 
the white house refused to release a list of those meeting with 
bush saying the sessions were private its an opportunity for 
the president to hear them the business leaders these are 
listening sessions the official said 
the sessions are an outgrowth of a meeting bush had over the 
weekend at the presidential retreat at camp david md with 
treasury secretary nicholas brady chief white house economist 
michael boskin budget director richard darman and vice president 
dan quayle 
the president at a news conference last thursday said he was 
concerned about an economic slowdown in the economy 
i want to be sure that to the degree a president can do 
something to soften the blow or to stimulate economic growth that 
he tries to do it bush said at the time 
white house officials today referred to those news conference 
remarks when asked about the series of meetings 
todays session is one of a series of private meetings the 
president is having to discuss the status of the economy with 
inside and outside experts the white house official said 
he likes to keep in touch the official added 
although administration officials have not used the word 
recession to describe the current slowdown many private 
economists have suggested that the economy may already be in a 
recession or at least teetering on the edge of one 
and boskin chairman of the presidents council of economic 
advisers has offered far gloomier assessments of economys 
condition in private meetings than in his public appearances 
administration sources said

four protesters were charged with misdemeanor 
trespassing after being caught on the nevada test site minutes 
before a british nuclear weapon was to be detonated deep beneath 
the desert floor 
the four were released on their own recognizance after an 
appearance wednesday before us magistrate lawrence leavitt 
scientists detonated the nuclear after a delay of more than two 
hours which government officials attributed both to technical 
problems and the search for the infiltrators near ground zero 
the device with an explosive punch up to 12 times the force of 
the world war ii atomic bomb dropped on hiroshima was detonated at 
1117 am wednesday after the four were removed by security 
officers 
were very pleased with the success of the protest said 
junior bridge a spokeswoman for the greenpeace environmental 
organization 
it was the second time in three years that antinuclear 
activists have infiltrated the sprawling secret desert site to 
delay a nuclear test 
motion from the blast was felt at las vegas city hall about 105 
miles away and atop the citys highrise hotels it measured 51 on 
the richter scale at the national earthquake information center in 
golden colo 
energy department officials rejected greenpeace claims that the 
four protesters were near ground zero until they popped into view 
of cameras monitoring the blast site during a technical hold in the 
countdown six minutes before detonation 
the nuclear device was buried 1900 feet deep in a shaft filled 
with concrete 
doe spokesman jim boyer said intruders could be nearly on ground 
zero and the blast would just shake them up a lot but energy 
department spokesman chris west has said that someone standing on 
ground zero could receive a jolt from the blast strong enough to 
break their legs 
all british nuclear tests are conducted in nevada under a mutual 
defense treaty with the united states 
wednesdays test was the eighth this year at the nevada site and 
the 707th since testing began there in 1951 the last previous test 
was oct 12

increased forest fires less snow warmer 
lakes and fewer trout in ontario may give a glimpse of what will 
happen if the earth warms as a result of the greenhouse effect 
canadian researchers say 
scientists at the canadian department of fisheries and oceans 
report friday in the journal science that lakes monitored for more 
than 20 years in northwestern ontario have been slowly changing as 
temperatures rise snowfall declines and fires ravage nearby 
forests 
d w schindler leader of the group said the study does not 
claim that the changes are due to the greenhouse effect but that 
the changes could be a preview of what is to come if the earth does 
warm up 
this is by no means the only period that has warmed for a 
prolonged time or at the rate that were seeing said schindler 
our point isto show what increasing warming and drying which 
we would see with a greenhouse effect would do to lakes and their 
watersheds 
the greenhouse effect refers to global warming that is caused 
when the atmosphere is enriched with carbon dioxide and some other 
manmade gases that affect the movement of solar radiation and heat 
the socalled greenhouse gases allow sunlight to pass through the 
atmosphere and strike the earth but the gases can prevent heat 
from radiating back out into space thus trapping thermal energy 
about the planet 
an increase in carbon dioxide is related to the burning of 
fossil fuels such as coal and oil 
the canadian study shows that snowfall and other precipitation 
has decreased since the mid1970s in the lakes in the ontario study 
area as a result water runoff into the lakes has declined and 
this in turn has affected the lake chemistry the waters have 
become clearer 
drier weather has led to more forest fires some burning over 
millions of acres in the watershed feeding the lakes this also 
changed the chemistry of the lakes and caused an increase in 
evaporation by allowing winds to more directly blow on the lakes 
schindler said air and water temperatures have increased on the 
average about 36 degrees during the study period 
snow which once blanketed the area from fall to spring now is 
sparse with midwinter melts occurring most years 
the lakes also lose their ice cover about 20 days earlier in the 
spring said schindler this allows the lakes to absorb more solar 
radiation in the spring and thus warm up sooner and reach a higher 
temperature 
plant life has increased and changed in the lakes due to the 
clearer water and warmer temperatures this could provide more food 
for some fish and small organisms but the warmer water may also 
cause major shifts in the types of fish said schindler 
we may have increased productivity from the lakes but there 
may be some pretty dramatic species changes he said what may 
be good trout lakes now may become good bass lakes but we would 
have to stock them because the bass would not invade naturally 
schindler emphasized that his group is only reporting the 
observed effects of temperature and precipitation changes not 
guessing on what is causing it 
im not going to speculate if this is due to increases in 
carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases or if it is a natural 
phenomenon at this point he said 
but schindler said that the study does show that the changes 
brought about by the greenhouse effect will be many varied and not 
altogether predictable 
our record indicates that it will not be a simplistic 
response he said 
schindler was on the staff of the department of fisheries and 
oceans when the study was conducted but is now a researcher at the 
university of alberta in edmonton 
science which published the study is the journal of the 
american association for the advancement of science

earths beauty and environmental threats to 
its survival are vividly displayed in blue planet a 5 
million giantscreen movie filmed by astronauts aboard seven space 
shuttle flights 
the 42minute film is opening this month at imax and omnimax 
theaters in 14 us and canadian cities it will be shown in at 
least 11 other cities during the next four months before being 
shown internationally next spring 
we hope the audience will come out of the film feeling 
concerned about protecting the earth its our only home said 
graeme ferguson producer of blue planet and cofounder of imax 
systems corp of toronto 
the movie gives viewers a real good feel for the perspective 
shuttle crew members have from low earth orbit said astronaut 
james buchli 45 a marine colonel who helped shoot the film during 
discoverys march 1989 mission 
its hard not to appreciate the grandeur of our earth from 
that perch buchli said by phone from johnson space center in 
texas you have a powerful feling of how insignificant each of 
us is with respect to the world as a whole 
the camera used to make blue planet was invented in 1967 
imax film has a frame size 10 times larger than conventional 35mm 
movie film providing intense detail and a widefield view that can 
be projected onto a giant screen 
blue planet depicts the natural and human forces that shape 
earths environment using imax and still photography from space 
and a variety of film shot on the planets surface and beneath the 
sea 
from space the movie shows peaceful almost alien scenes of 
volcanoes eerie lightning flashes puffy thunderclouds and giant 
swirling hurricanes then the film moves to the ground capturing 
the violence of those natural processes with help from a powerful 
sound system 
the movie was directed by fourtime oscarwinning sound designer 
ben burtt who did sound effects for the stars wars trilogy and 
indiana jones films 
the main message of blue planet deals with human damage to 
the environment topsoil from farms washing down the mississippi 
and yangtze rivers destruction of madagascar forests vast 
stretches of city lights gobbling energy and a pall of smoke 
obscuring the amazon basin as rain forest goes up in flames 
the space scenes in blue planet were shot during seven 
shuttle flights between 1984 and april 
ferguson 61 also produced the dream is alive the 1985 
film that has been seen by more than 25 million people worldwide 
and was the first to use imax cameras aboard shuttles he 
coproduced hail columbia the 1982 imax film about the first 
shuttle mission an imax camera wasnt aboard that flight 
lockheed corp paid most of the 5 million cost of blue 
planet other sponsors were the smithsonian institutions 
national air and space museum imax systems and the national 
aeronautics and space administration 
ferguson said the next imax film is a bit less cosmic a 
90minute feature on the rolling stones concert tour

the bush administration is preparing a plan to 
cut public power subsidies but expects strong opposition from 
beneficiaries of the lowcost energy lawmakers say 
the proposals explore selling public power to the highest 
bidder as well as including a surcharge to bring prices up to 
market levels in areas where the subsidized power is sold below 
cost 
auctioning off federal power at market rates is a radical 
radical notion said paul reiten an energy expert for sen mark 
hatfield rore for instance southern california could come in 
and outbid the northwest and leave the northwest with a power 
shortage 
the office of budget and management offering suggestions for 
president bushs new national energy strategy outlined the 
moneysaving options last week in recommendations to the energy 
department 
omb and doe officials declined comment on the plan but the 
american public power association provided a copy of the memo to 
the associated press it was confirmed by aides to hatfield 
this proposal eliminates multibillion dollar energy 
consumption subsidies at a time when doe is expanding energy 
conservation subsidies the omb memo said 
the agency acknowledged the plan would not be accepted by 
interest groups receiving the subsidies the beneficiaries have a 
wellorganized and strong nationwide constituency and are 
represented by powerful lobbying organizations 
presidents reagan and bush previously have recommended saving 
money by raising interest rates or speeding up debt payments for 
the nations five public power marketing administrations 
the biggest the bonneville power administration provides about 
half the pacific northwests power serving about 8 million 
consumers 
hatfield said he believes the plan would boost wholesale public 
power rates in his region by more than 30 percent and residential 
rates by nearly 20 percent 
this isnt a budget deficit measure this is a proposal for 
social and economic disaster in the pacific northwest hatfield 
said 
rep al swift dwash a member of the house energy and 
commerce committee said any federal gains through reduced 
subsidies would be more than offset by shortfalls in tax receipts 
as a result of the economic impact on the northwest 
it is a shortsighted stupid monomania idea in the mind of 
some troll in omb swift said 
the omb memo said the power administrations provide subsidies 
for the welltodo at the expense of the taxpayers in cities and 
poorer areas of the country the belowcost sales have cost the 
federal treasury 4 billion since the dams were built the agency 
said 
bpa has the greatest installed generating capacity among the 
five administrations 22900 megawatts 
but the plan also would address western area power 
administration 10400 megawatts southeastern power 
administration 3090 megawatts southwestern power administration 
2150 megawatts alaska power administration 108 megawatts 
it takes about 1000 megawatts to meet the energy needs of a 
city the size of seattle

most americans are disillusioned with the 
current health care system and favor rationing although no one 
strategy has majority support according to a survey released 
thursday 
the poll conducted for northwestern life insurance company 
found just 30 percent of those surveyed agreed that the countrys 
health care system is working well while 67 percent disagreed 
more than 9 in 10 agreed that health care costs expected to 
reach 650 billion for the nation this year are rising out of 
control and that the countrys health care system needs major 
changes to control costs 
while more than twothirds of those surveyed said they were 
confident their health care costs would be taken care of if they 
became seriously ill today 60 percent worried that would not be 
the case in the future 
ninetyfour percent said health care should be available to 
everyone regardless of ability to pay but 52 percent said people 
who can pay should be able to buy extra care if they want it 
michael conley senior vice president for group insurance at the 
minneapolisbased northwestern life said this seeming 
contradiction is probably because americans are still forming 
their values on rationing 
but panelists who spoke after the poll results were presented 
said they were surprised that people think rationing is a new 
concept they suggested that people have different interpretations 
of what it means 
we really do ration health care now by limitations on 
access to health care said john golenski president of the 
bioethics consultation group inc of berkeley calif and an 
architect of oregons plan to revamp its medicaid program 
an estimated 31 million to 37 million americans are uninsured 
the survey focused on beliefs about rationing in general and did 
not ask more broadly what kind of changes in the current system 
people would like to see 
the poll found that 85 percent agreed with at least one of six 
rationing concepts presented but a majority could not agree on any 
one strategy 
the strongest support 44 percent was for idea that treatments 
or procedures that are rationed or denied should be denied to 
everyone regardless of ability to pay 
forty percent said availability of publicly funded health care 
should be based on the chance of success of the treatment and 29 
percent said smokers should be denied public funds for health care 
for treatment of illness caused by smoking 
more than a quarter said children should be given priority for 
services and 16 percent said rationing should apply only to those 
using public funds 
also half said they would trust a panel of medical 
professionals to make rationing decisions 
the poll conducted by project research inc of minneapolis 
involved telephone interviews with 500 adults in august and 
september the margin of error was 45 percent officials said

thrift regulators are demanding a record 68 
billion from drexel burnham lambert inc for alleged junk bond 
fraud the collapsed investment firm says its being made a 
scapegoat for the savings and loan debacle 
the claims filed in federal bankruptcy court on wednesday accuse 
drexel and its former junk bond chief michael milken of 
plundering more than 40 failed thrifts through racketeering 
fraud bribery and numerous other crimes 
the allegations brought by the federal deposit insurance corp 
and the resolution trust corp are by far the largest damages 
sought in the sampl crisis which is expected to cost taxpayers more 
than 500 billion over 30 years 
they also for the first time pin much of the blame for the 
crisis on drexel 
the 60page court filing released today claims drexel starting 
in 1982 spread a gospel of greed and illegally made billions of 
dollars by inducing sampls to use their federally insured deposits to 
buy junk bonds 
the exposure of drexels and milkens criminality destroyed 
the illusions surrounding junk bonds that drexel and milken had 
sought to create the filing said 
the agencies charged drexel manipulated junk bond prices 
arranged secret securities parking deals ran sham 
transactions bribed favored customers and controlled a network of 
sampl customers to sustain a fictitious market 
the filing lists 41 failed thrifts with junk bond losses 
totaling more than 330 million and seeks 125 million more in 
damages for the lost value of current holdings an additional 18 
failed thrifts have separate nonjunk bond claims institutions 
from 18 states and the district of columbia are included 
the alleged damages sought are tripled under federal antitrust 
and racketeering laws for a total of 6 billion the agencies also 
seek 800 million for the alleged illegal activity unrelated to 
junk bonds 
a separate claim for more than 45 billion was filed on behalf 
of columbia savings and loan association of los angeles which has 
not been taken over by the government 
the largest claimed loss is 562 million by imperial savings 
association of san diego and the smallest 27500 by charter 
savings bank of newport beach calif the filing seeks 150 million 
for alleged securities fraud by drexel against capital bank amp trust 
co of washington dc 
fdic and rtc chairman l william seidman said the agencies 
still have much more to do to ensure that we identify and recover 
all the losses caused by drexel the american taxpayers expect 
no less from us 
drexel said in a statement that it has become a convenient 
scapegoat for the sampl crisis as various agencies and branches of 
the government attempt to deflect their own responsibility 
regardless of the number of zeros in the claims drexel 
intends to vigorously defend against them the firm said in 
court the conduct of regulators and others chiefly responsible for 
the sampl debacle will be the real issue 
drexel which sought chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in 
february already faces billions of dollars more in claims in more 
than 100 lawsuits filed by investors shareholders and former 
clients 
milken has pleaded guilty to securities violations and is 
awaiting sentencing next week 
the fdic insures deposits for the nations savings and loans 
resolution trust oversees the thrift bailout and has taken over 
more than 100 failed sampls 
drexel handled most of the 15 billion in junk bonds bought by 
thrifts but the junk bond market collapsed about a year ago 
devastating the securities value 
the claims are far larger than a 11 billion racketeering 
lawsuit filed by the government against lincoln savings and loan 
head charles keating and others 
but the fdic and resolution trust are not expected to get 
anything near 68 billion 
lawyers for drexel and those who have sued the company are 
negotiating a fixed amount to be set aside to settle more than 100 
lawsuits and the federal claims 
in addition drexels assets not counting the value of its junk 
bond portfolio and certain stock investments total only about 3 
billion against 285 billion in liabilities 
drexel and milken have denied any role in the sampl collapse and 
a march 1989 report by the congressional general accounting office 
concluded that junk bonds had not contributed to the sampl crisis 
but the sampl industry was criticized for dealing in junk bonds 
which offer high yields at high risk under last years federal 
thrift bailout bill savings and loans must sell their junk bond 
holdings by 1994 
the fdic and rtc alleged among other things that drexel made 
misrepresentations about the bonds and gave payoffs to managers of 
some sampls 
drexel also allegedly engaged in anticompetitive practices and 
threatened companies that did not retain drexel as an investment 
banker

winstonsalem nc ap a woman found guilty of murdering a 
former boyfriend by spoonfeeding him food laced with arsenic 
just loves people and shouldnt be put to death her daughter 
told a jury today 
blanche taylor moore 57 was convicted wednesday in the death 
of raymond reid in 1986 
as mrs moores sentencing hearing got under way this morning 
vanessa woods said her mother cared for ms woods premature baby 
when it was born several years ago like its mother 
my mother is just the same today as she always is she said 
she just loves people 
mrs moore also is charged with murder in the poisoning of her 
first husband in 1973 and with assault for allegedly poisoning her 
current husband after their honeymoon last year no trial dates 
have been set in those cases 
another character witness at the hearing jailer carolyn 
hinshaw told jurors today that she and mrs moore get down on her 
knees every morning and evening and pray during in the 1 years 
mrs moore has been in jail 
all i knew about her is what i read in the paper mrs 
hinshaw said she wasnt there very long before her concerns for 
other people became very evident 
the only options before the jury were life in prison or death 
which is carried out by injection or gas in north carolina 
the only woman executed in the united states in the last 15 
years was also a north carolina woman convicted of fatally 
poisoning a boyfriend with arsenic velma barfield was put to death 
in 1984 
the jury convicted mrs moore on wednesday after six hours of 
deliberations over two days 
prosecutors said mrs moore killed reid to gain part of his 
estate feeding him spiked homecooked food while he lay dying 
from arsenic poisoning in the hospital his symptoms had been 
mistakenly diagnosed as a rare nerve and muscle disease 
mrs moore testified last week that she is lovingly cared for 
the three men she is accused of poisoning 
i know arsenic was found in these three people but i know 
that i didnt do it she said ive never physically harmed 
other people 
mrs moores estranged husband the rev dwight moore who was 
hospitalized for arsenic poisoning last year told a newspaper 
wednesday that he was against execution i would be more at peace 
with a life sentence than the death penalty moore told the 
roanoke va times amp worldnews 
moore who is living on disability and had to resign from his 
position at the carolina united methodist church of christ near 
burlington because of the effects of the poisoning said he had 
been confident that mrs moore would be found guilty 
i felt the jury could have made the decision walking down the 
hall to the jury room he said 
defense attorneys tried to blame an acquaintance of mrs 
moores garvin thomas who is now dead 
they produced a rambling fivepage letter in which he allegedly 
confessed to the crimes but handwriting experts differed on 
whether mrs moore or thomas could have written the letter 
officials exhumed five bodies while investigating the case 
including those of mrs moores father a former motherinlaw of 
hers and a former coworker 
they found arsenic in the remains of mrs moores father but 
she was not charged in his death

business inventories grew 05 percent in 
september the government said thursday leading some analysts to 
express concern the buildup could lead to further production cuts 
and loss of jobs 
economist evelina tainer of the first national bank of chicago 
noted that industrial production in october already dropped 08 
percent its sharpest cutback in nine months 
its consistent with the idea that the economy is sliding into 
a recession and growth will be negative in the fourth quarter 
she said 
analysts said the inventory level itself had not reached a 
dangerous level although continued vigilance was needed to prevent 
an even deeper reduction in output 
the commerce department said inventories held on shelves and 
backlots in september totaled a seasonally adjusted 8115 billion 
up from 8075 billion the previous month 
but the accumulation slowed from a 07 percent gain in both july 
and august the largest increases since an 08 percent advance in 
july 1989 
business sales dipped 05 percent to a seasonally adjusted 
5487 billion down from 5515 billion a month earlier 
it was the first decline in sales since a 04 percent drop in 
july and the largest since a 10 percent decrease last april 
august sales had jumped 21 percent 
the ratio of inventories to sales edged up to 148 from a 146 
level in august the ratio means it would take 148 months to 
exhaust the backlog of goods at the september sales pace 
still the ratio was down from its recent peak of 154 in july 
1989 and economist michael p niemira of mitsubishi bank in new 
york said businesses are now able to react more rapidly to economic 
developments and avoid serious buildups 
the ratio reached a high of 174 in january 1982 during the last 
recession 
i think youll see inventories coming down but coming down 
coincident with a slowdown in sales niemira said noting that 
retail purchases last month slowed to a 01 percent increase from a 
13 percent advance in september 
in both months however the sales gains were fueled by high 
gasoline prices rather than volume when the gasoline component 
was excluded retail sales actually fell 01 percent last month 
while rising just 09 percent in september 
all categories posted inventory gains manufacturers up 06 
percent and wholesalers and retailers up 04 percent each 
at the same time manufacturers sales fell 07 percent while 
wholesalers posted a 18 percent decline sales at the retail level 
jumped 13 percent

a cubanborn man who pleaded guilty to 
conspiracy in the 1976 assassination of former chilean ambassador 
orlando letelier was sentenced thursday to 12 years in prison 
us district judge aubrey robinson jr called the deaths of 
letelier and an aide ronni moffitt a cold ruthless act of 
terrorism before sentencing jose dionisio suarez esquivel to the 
maximum prison term allowed under a plea agreement 
suarez a member of the cuban national movement was described 
by his attorney as an anticastro cuban 
in all his political zeal he turned to one of the few 
countries in the world that could have given him freedom 
robinson said referring to suarezs move to the united states but 
he chose not to be as free as everyone else the judge said 
letelier and moffitt were killed here sept 21 1976 when a 
bomb exploded beneath the former ambassadors car letelier 
chiles ambassador to washington from 1971 to 1973 was an 
outspoken critic of the rightwing military government of gen 
augusto pinochet 
suarez who had been a fugitive for a dozen years in september 
admitted giving a blasting cap to former chilean intelligence agent 
michael v townley who allegedly masterminded the assassination 
in exchange for suarezs plea authorities agreed to drop 
charges of concealing a fugitive against his wife elizabeth 
gongora suarez officials said 
suarez 51 will be eligible for parole after serving nine 
years 
two other people have been convicted in connection with the 
bombing townley was sentenced to 10 years while former chilean 
army maj armando fernandez larios received seven years 
fernandez defected from chile in 1987 and pleaded guilty to an 
accessory after the fact he implicated two of his superiors and 
pinochet in the coverup of the chilean militarys involvement in 
the crime 
the two chilean military officials have been charged with 
participating in the murder but the chilean government has refused 
to extradite them

slapping or spanking children only encourages them 
to think violence is an acceptable form of behavior says a social 
workers group 
the national association of social workers which previously 
opposed corporal punishment in schools has passed a resolution 
rejecting physical punishment for children in the home 
since the policy was passed in august the silver spring 
mdbased group with 130000 members has been promoting its 
resolution nationwide 
beating a child whipping a child spanking a child is really 
not a rational way of teaching a child how to change his or her 
behavior said isadora hare staff director of the groups 
commission on education 
what you do is breed resentment in the child and anger towards 
you which is going to come out in more undesirable behavior what 
is important is to teach a child why behavior is unacceptable 
the no spanking policy and alternative means of child discipline 
is being discussed the groups annual meeting this week in boston 
nineteen states ban corporal punishment in schools hare said 
but dissuading parents from hitting their children will be tough in 
a country where such discipline is widespread largely because of 
religious beliefs she said

award fred had been performing in shows at the park for the last 
six years

trained animals for the parks show the company provided the 
cockatoos for the baretta series and brought fred to the wild 
animal park an affiliate of the san diego zoo in 1984 hanscom

president bush invoked emergency powers 
thursday authorizing the pentagon to undertake military 
construction projects in the persian gulf without advance approval 
from congress 
without the waiver the pentagon would have had to go through a 
lengthy process of requesting authorization from congress for each 
construction project and then seeking an appropriation from 
lawmakers to finance it 
operational requirements do not permit such an extended 
process for construction of muchneeded facilities bush said in 
a letter to leaders of the house and senate 
bush said his action will enable secretary of defense dick 
cheney to undertake military construction projects that he deems 
necessary to respond to the threat caused by the iraqi invasion of 
kuwait 
bush granted the waiver in an executive order under the 
authority of the national emergencies act

a teenager identified as a suspect in 
the slayings of five gainesville college students was sentenced 
thursday to 22 months in a prison mental hospital for beating his 
elderly grandmother 
edward lewis humphrey who has a history of mental problems 
also faces an assault charge in gainesville and a 1988 attempted 
rape and burglary case in indian river county 
public defender jr russo told circuit judge theron yawn that 
he could find no public treatment center willing to accept the 
19yearold university of florida student private psychiatric 
hospitals wanted 600 to 1000 per day to treat him more than his 
family could afford russo said 
hospitals run by the universities of florida miami and south 
florida refused to accept humphrey for private commitment 
partially because of his notoriety russo said 
humphrey was convicted oct 10 on a charge of battery on a 
person over age 65 
the judge imposed the maximum prison term and recommended to the 
state prison system that humphrey serve it in the corrections 
mental health institution at florida state hospital in 
chattahoochee 
i look at it as a psychiatric care sentence russo said 
adding that he doesnt think humphrey will serve any of his time in 
a regular prison 
humphrey has been labeled a suspect in the slayings of five 
students some of them mutilated near the university of florida 
campus in gainesville during the last week in august but he has 
not been charged in those cases 
he had been jailed in lieu of 1 million bond since the beating 
aug 30 at his home in indialantic two days after the last two 
bodies were discovered in gainesville 
humphreys grandmother elna hlavaty told a deputy that night 
that her grandson had beaten and choked her but at the trial she 
testified she had fallen and hurt herself in the dark 
russo had argued for probation with temporary commitment to a 
mental hospital but the judge said he wanted a sentence somewhere 
between probation and prison 
humphreys family reacted angrily to the sentence with his 
79yearold grandmother calling it a charade of justice 
it should have been thrown out i was never beaten she 
said that boy has done nothing wrong 
any hope ed had of being a normal person has been washed 
away said humphreys 22yearold brother george choking back 
tears 
its sad to see ed sacrificed george humphrey said 
edward humphrey nodded when his grandmother blew him a kiss as 
he entered the courtroom but generally appeared oblivious to the 
proceedings and mostly stared off into space 
the judge also placed humphrey on probation for 14 months after 
his prison term with the condition that he continue psychiatric 
treatment if needed 
humphrey was to transferred to an orlando hospital for a 
psychiatric evaluation and then to the state prison systems mental 
health hospital within the next three days russo said

equivalent to the same increase in the 12 european community 
countries it said 
worldwide price reductions of at least 10 percent for wheat 
and 9 percent for coarse grains would be necessary to absorb the 
additional output the panel added 
coarse grains are normally fed to farm animals 
the soviet union produces large quantities of oil and coal 
poland is also a big coal producer winters saw world supplies 
increasing as eastern european factories become more efficient and 
use less energy and as new drilling methods increase soviet oil 
production 
world oil prices could tumble perhaps by as much as 
onefifth squeezing highcost producers such as britain mexico 
and texas and reducing opecs market power the report said 
opec is the organization of petroleum exporting countries 
similarly increases in east european output of coal and gas 
will put downward pressure on world prices even allowing for some 
output reductions for environmental reasons such as in east 
germany it added 
members of the panel came from britain switzerland italy 
sweden norway and belgium it was organized by the centre for 
economic policy research in london 
the center is a network based on european universities its 
report the first of an annual series was titled monitoring 
european integration the impact of eastern europe 
portes aid it was presented last week to authorities of the 
european community he presented it to reporters thursday under the 
auspices of the brookings institution a major private research

gen norman schwarzkopf 
commander of us forces in the middle east saluted american 
troops on wednesday for defending freedom just as the pilgrims did 
in 1620 
in a thanksgiving message released eight days early he said the 
americans defending saudi arabia in operation desert shield have 
shown the same courage as the pilgrims who celebrated the first 
thanksgiving the operation he said has become a symbol of 
freedom around the world 
here is the text of schwarzkopfs message 
in 1620 a group of courageous and determined men and women 
traveled halfway around the world to restore their freedoms and 
return to peaceful just lives three hundred seventy years later 
another group of courageous americans has again traveled halfway 
around the world to the arabian gulf region to defend those same 
eternal principles 
as we take a brief respite from our important mission in order 
to celebrate a harvest of blessings i want all of you to know that 
you have the countrys deepest gratitude for the superb job you are 
doing making desert shield a symbol of freedom around the world 
for those of you deployed away from home this will not be a 
traditional thanksgiving but for everyone it will certainly be a 
meaningful one as each of you does your part to defend the ideals 
that americans have held so dear for generations i salute and

polands postcommunist army has been 
trimmed by 100000 soldiers and will be nearly halved to transform 
it into the defensive force of a neutral country the defense 
ministry announced thursday 
meanwhile troops are being reoriented to defend the eastern 
border with the soviet union as well as the western frontier as 
they had before officials said at a news conference 
military officials of the old regime are being replaced with 62 
percent of the defense ministry administration changed since 
solidarity took over the government last year the officials said 
they said any military role of the warsaw pact already has been 
frozen 
we hope that military power will never again be the weightiest 
argument in european or world politics said vice adm piotr 
kolodziejczyk the defense minister who in july replaced the 
longtime communist defense chief gen florian siwicki 
poland always maintained the largest army in the warsaw pact 
after the soviet union 
now it will undergo a thorough transformation as it shifts to a 
defensive orientation and sheds its political role kolodziejczyk 
told reporters at his first news conference as defense minister 
troops will number 305000 by the end of december down from 
more than 400000 in 1988 he said 
planners have started intensive work on a new military model 
dubbed armed forces 90 that envisions an army of 230000 to 
250000 highly mobile welltrained wellarmed troops 
polands defense will no longer be focused only on its western 
border the officials said however permanent redeployment of 
divisions to the eastern border is too expensive now although it 
will be considered if budgets allow in the future 
kolodziejczyk said it would take no more than a day to move 
troops to eastern poland adding despite the absence of people in 
uniform in those regions we care about assuring security and 
people should be assured 
he rejected claims from candidates in polands nov 25 
presidential election that democratic change has been too slow in 
the military he said 56 generals will have left by jan 1 when 
there will be a total of 88 compared with 188 in 1984 and 96 in 
polands last independent army on the eve of world war ii in 1939 
deputy defense minister janusz onyszkiewicz a civilian formerly 
known as the spokesman for the longbanned solidarity movement 
predicted that two military groups will exist after the demise of 
the warsaw pact nato and the soviet union or at least the 
russian republic 
poland will be a neutral country not aligned with either 
he said 
poland will remain neutral in the sense that it does not 
plan in the future to join nato or to get into some kind of 
military alliance with the soviet union which would make it 
impossible for poland to keep close to both the west and the 
east he said 
onyszkiewicz said the warsaw pacts military role has 
essentially ended 
at the moment these institutions do not function they are 
completely frozen and our armed forces are under absolute control 
of the polish command and the polish political authorities he 
said 
poland sees the warsaw pact having a brief second life as a 
consultative body we think it is something relatively 
shorttermed and this pact is of a transitional character but we 
think it can fill a certain political void which otherwise would be 
created in central europe onyszkiewicz said

most cystic fibrosis cases occur because cells 
single out and block a crucial protein when it is misformed 
suggests a study that boosts prospects for developing treatment 
scientists had already linked cystic fibrosis to a malfunction 
on the surface of cells but the finding that the malformed protein 
simply never shows up on the surface where it belongs was a big 
surprise to us said researcher alan smith 
the finding supports the idea that cystic fibrosis may be 
treatable by having patients inhale an aerosol to deliver the 
protein into its proper place he said 
cystic fibrosis is a genetic disorder that affects about 30000 
children and young adults in the united states their lungs produce 
a thick sticky mucus that sets the stage for fatal lung 
infections mucus elsewhere interferes with digestion 
the abnormal mucus appears because cells cannot expel charged 
particles called chloride ions while they absorb other particles 
called sodium ions too rapidly 
that results from defects in the gene that tells cells how to 
make a protein called cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance 
regulator or cftr the genetic defects lead to faulty versions of 
cftr 
the new study suggests that most cases of cystic fibrosis occur 
because these versions never reach their proper place on the cell 
surface 
the work is reported in fridays issue of the journal cell by 
smith and colleagues at the genzyme corp of framingham mass 
its a beautiful piece of work that allowed them to make 
an important new hypothesis about what causes cystic fibrosis 
commented dr michael welsh of the university of iowa college of 
medicine in iowa city and the howard hughes medical institute 
the work was done in monkey cells and the hypothesis should now 
be tested in cells from cystic fibrosis patients and healthy 
people he said 
for the research scientists injected cells in the laboratory 
with genetic material that carried specific mutations some of 
which mimicked defects in the cftr gene that cause cystic fibrosis 
the mutation responsible for about 70 percent of cystic fibrosis 
cases led to a version of cftr that was incompletely processed by 
the cell scientists found 
normally the cell adds carbohydrates to the backbone of the 
cftr protein that is a twostep process but the defective version 
of cftr completed only the first step smith said 
apparently it was recognized as abnormal by some sort of 
quality control mechanism he said in a telephone interview 
the abnormal protein failed to continue on to take up its normal 
position on the surface of the cell he said 
genzyme scientists are studing the possibility of treating 
cystic fibrosis by replacing the missing cftr at the cell surface 
he said this finding very much encourages us he said 
the idea would be to use a virus or some other targeting system 
to deliver normal cftr to lung cells he said 
that strategy had been discussed before along with others such 
as delivering normal cftr genes to the cells noted robert beall 
the cystic fibrosis foundations executive vice president for 
medical affairs 
the new work suggests that protein replacement may be a very 
important option he said 
smith said that the absence of cftr at the cell surface does not 
cause all cases of cystic fibrosis the study found that two very 
rare genetic mutations that cause the disease do not keep cftr from 
getting to the surface he said

more than 100 americans and their foreignborn 
family members are expected to leave kuwait on sunday aboard a 
uschartered iraqi airways flight the state department said 
thursday 
most are women and children who have been eligible to leave for 
some time but decided only recently to do so said deputy spokesman 
richard boucher 
iraq has forbidden american men to leave iraq and kuwait except 
for those with arab ancestry more than 100 american men have been 
taken to military and industrial installations to deter a possible 
us attack on iraq 
after leaving kuwait the plane is scheduled to stop in baghdad 
before proceeding to london it was not clear when the americans 
and their family members would arrive in the united states 
earlier charter flights have taken more than 2000 americans out 
of iraq and kuwait according to us estimates there are fewer 
than 1000 americans left in the two countries 
some americans responding to an iraqi invitation are making 
plans for holiday visits to family members trapped in iraq and 
kuwait the state department is opposed to such travel saying the 
safety of the visiting americans cannot be assured

doctors may be giving bad advice about the dangers 
of heart disease by not considering the interaction of risk factors 
such as high blood pressure high cholesterol and smoking a doctor 
said thursday 
based on single factor determinations they may be needlessly 
alarming or falsely reassuring patients said dr william b 
kannel of boston university 
kannel is one of the principal investigators with the framingham 
heart study a 40yearlong study of 5209 people in framingham 
mass 25 miles west of boston 
the study has provided the information researchers use to 
determine how much an elevated cholesterol level for example or 
hypertension increases a persons risk of heart disease 
kannel and the american heart association announced the 
development of a risk factor prediction kit that will enable 
doctors to better estimate patients heart disease risks 
the kit based on the framingham data allows doctors to 
calculate the heart disease or stroke risk associated with a given 
combination of risk factors kannel said 
we need a more efficient profile to pick out the ones who are 
truly in jeopardy kannel said at the heart associations annual 
meeting 
he said 30 percent to 40 percent of americans for example have 
cholesterol levels high enough to require treatment 
many of those might not have substantially increased 
heartdisease risks however kannel said 
a patient with mildly high cholesterol and no other risk factors 
may have only onetenth the increased risk of a patient with the 
same cholesterol level who also has high blood pressure is 
overweight and smokes kannel said 
the problem everybody hasnt fully appreciated is that the 
risk varies over a 10fold range for each single risk factor 
depending upon what other risk factors are found in combination 
with it he said 
the major controllable risk factors for heart disease are 
cigarette smoking high blood pressure and high cholesterol the 
heart association says 
other risk factors cant be changed increasing age raises the 
risk as does a family history of heart disease and men have 
substantially higher risks than women 
the risk factor prediction kit takes into account age sex 
cholesterol blood pressure smoking and the level of highdensity 
lipoproteins the socalled good cholesterol 
it shows for example that a 60yearold man whose only risk 
factor is an elevated cholesterol level of 240 has a 13 percent 
chance of having a heart attack during the next 10 years 
if his blood pressure is high that risk could jump to 18 
percent or 20 percent and if he smokes it would be even higher 
the risk factor prediction kit which is intended for use by 
doctors will be followed by a similar kit intended to give 
patients some idea of their risks so they can decide whether to see 
a doctor for a better evaluation 
feeling well is no guarantee against a heart attack kannel 
said one in five men have heart attacks before age 60 and one 
in three of them arent going to make it out of the room he 
said

pilot error and technical failure 
were cited thursday as possible causes of the crash of an alitalia 
dc9 jetliner that killed all 46 people aboard when it slammed into 
a wooded hillside 
seven americans were identified thursday as being among the 40 
passengers killed when flight az404 from milan crashed late 
wednesday five miles outside zurichs international airport six 
italian crew members also died 
pope john paul ii sent a message of condolence to the victims 
families 
bodies remained trapped inside the firegutted wreckage 24 hours 
after the crash police said identification could take weeks as 
most victims were burned beyond recognition 
white sheets concealed human remains scattered among charred 
plane wreckage and scorched tree stumps on the rainsoaked ground 
thursday 
a notepad that survived the inferno lay open among the debris 
the green red and white alitalia emblem was still visible through 
ashes covering the jetliners tail which was lying upside down 
rain hampered efforts to retrieve the victims and inspect the 
wreckage 
eugen thomann a zurich police official said it appeared all 
victims were killed on impact 
zurich airport spokesman andreas meier said witness accounts 
suggested several causes for the crash 
but he said radar data indicated the pilot misjudged his 
altitude he said the plane was flying about 1000 feet below the 
normal altitude during the landing approach 
alitalia officials told italian television that failure of the 
planes electronic navigation system was also a possibility 
meier said terrorism was being considered but stressed there 
were no indications the airplane was the target of an attack 
most of the passengers on the lateevening flight linking two 
financial centers were probably businessmen and people on personal 
visits rather than tourists he said 
investigators found both the aircrafts flight recorders or 
black boxes one recorder tracks flight data and the other 
tapes cockpit conversations 
meanwhile italian government investigators arrived to assist in 
the inquiry 
witnesses in villages near the scene of the crash said something 
appeared wrong with the approaching aircraft 
i ran outside because the plane was so loud said one 
resident who insisted on anonymity then i saw that the plane 
was flying unusually low and seemed to be swaying 
other witnesses said the pilot seemed to rev the planes engine 
just before the crash it sounded like a sudden roar one 
villager said but then there was a thud and it turned deathly 
quiet 
there were also accounts of fire and apparent explosions 
before the plane went down but officials were unable to confirm 
those accounts 
i shudder every time i think how near the village the plane 
crashed said a shocked woman in stadel about half a mile from 
the crash site 
the twoengine jetliner was on schedule on its 50minute flight 
from milan the swiss meteorological office said visibility at the 
time of the crash was good with light wind and light rain 
josef meier cq a spokesman for swiss air traffic control 
authorities told reporters radar records showed the plane was 
horizontally on course but flying about 990 feet below the correct 
altitude 
traffic was heavy at the time and controllers did not 
continuously monitor the jets height he said adding that this 
was normal procedure 
radio contact was normal until two minutes before the crash and 
controllers received no distress signal officials said they said 
the investigation could take months 
alitalia said the dc9 was built in 1974 and was last inspected 
on nov 4 
the flight commander raffaele liberta 47 was a 20year 
alitalia veteran who had flown more than 10000 hours 
the us embassy in bern identified the american victims as 
karol forman paul vaughan and william briggs of new york state 
john stuckey and jerry bass of north carolina robert anderson an 
american resident of switzerland and stephen ritter for whom they 
had no further information

the republican national committee is cutting 
its staff 25 percent a reduction party officials say is normal for 
the start of a nonelection year 
we gear up in the even years and we gear down in the odd 
years said mary matalin rnc executive director the committee 
has about 270 fulltime employees 
bj cooper communications director for the committee said a 
comparable staff reduction occurred four years ago after the 1986 
midterm elections 
matalin and cooper denied published reports the cutbacks were 
forced by a disappointing fundraising year or were ordered by 
white house chief of staff john sununu 
were 100 percent supportive of their effort to shift gears 
said ed rogers white house political director there was no 
instruction to do anything out of here its part of a longstanding 
plan the white house was informed of it on an fyi basis the day 
before yesterday 
the rnc had an operating budget for 1990 of 26 million and 
raised more than enough to cover it 
at the democratic national committee spokeswoman ginny terzano 
said no immediate cutbacks are planned but the dnc is a much 
leaner operation with only 100 fulltime employees 
the democrats raised just over 10 million in 1990 including a 
record 27 million wednesday night at the partys annual gala

mikhail s gorbachev will be ready for political 
battle when he addresses the legislature friday and is confident 
his views will prevail said an italian leader who met the soviet 
president thursday 
the official tass news agency in a commentary said gorbachev 
would face a moment of truth when he speaks to lawmakers on the 
crumbling economy and on campaigns by separatistminded republics 
gorbachev agreed to address the legislators after lawmakers 
angered by the slow pace of reform demanded a report on the state 
of the union 
they similarly wanted a report on gorbachevs weekend meeting 
with russian federation president boris n yeltsin yeltsin also 
will speak to the national legislature friday tass said 
achille occhetto leader of the italian communist pary met in 
moscow with gorbachev on thursday and said gorbachev was candid 
about the countrys economic and political problems 
gorbachev predicted that the next 18 months would be crucial to 
his political and economic reforms occhetto said during that 
time the country will be trying to switch from a centrally planned 
to a market economy 
soviet economists have predicted unemployment and inflation will 
worsen during the transition some goods have disappeared from 
stores and prices have risen fast squeezing retirees and other 
people with fixed incomes in many cases food is being rationed 
i feel gorbachev is selfconfident and ready for political 
battle occhetto said at a news conference i feel he will be 
the master of the situation 
soviet television said thursday that gorbachev would speak to 
the legislature about the sharply worsening conditions in the 
country 
according to tass legislators at the supreme soviet became 
rebellious wednesday and refused to discuss bills suggested from 
above until a new treaty on relations between the kremlin and the 
republics is concluded 
many of the countrys 15 republics especially russia are 
disregarding laws passed by the national legislature and decrees 
adopted by gorbachev and the council of ministers or soviet 
cabinet 
the legislature of russia on thursday heard a report on the 
economic and political situation in the republic from government 
leaders tass said it said the session was held behind closed 
doors and no details were released 
a day earlier the russian government said a soviet decision to 
lift price controls on luxury goods would not be implemented in 
the republic the moscow city council seconded the russian 
governments action 
one prominent soviet politician said the military might have to 
be called in to restore order 
if the constitution is trampled upon and some forces 
separatists or other antisocialist associations attempt to 
dismember this country or change its social system by force or 
other anticonstitutional means the armed forces can be used 
marshal sergei akhromeyev a member of the national legislature and 
gorbachev adviser wrote in the daily sovietskaya rossiya 
moldavias leaders also balked at freeing prices deputy premier 
konstantin tampiza told the moldavian parliament the measure was 
not even worth discussing let alone ratifying until action is 
coordinated with other republics tass said 
the central asian republic of kazakhstan similarly decided to 
defy the kremlin its parliament said the resolution freeing prices 
would have no effect in the republic the independent news agency 
interfax reported 
prices are rising but wages stay the same said deputy lev 
trybnikov its not a market but downright robbery 
the leaders of all soviet republics were invited to attend 
gorbachevs speech but one republic declined the invitation the 
estonian news agency said arnold ruutel president of the estonian 
republic would not attend because the soviet constitution is not 
valid on estonian territory 
battles were also raging within the kremlin 
a national government commission ordered the railroad ministry 
to cancel plans to stop accepting rubles as payment for trips 
abroad 
the ministry had said passengers leaving the country would have 
to pay in foreign currency starting the governments foreign 
economic commission part of the council of ministers told the 
railroad minister to rescind it 
tass said the confrontations were part of the progressing 
paralysis of power 
the news agency said gorbachevs speech was expected to include 
specific proposals to reverse the deteriorating situation in the 
country 
will gorbachev justify the expectations tass asked the 
most radicalminded critics express doubt on that score pointing 
out that gorbachev a master at subtle multioption moves lacks 
resoluteness when hard decisions need to be made 
but the news agency said gorbachev supporters in the supreme 
soviet blame his heavy workload for delays in reaching accord with 
the restive republics 
he tries to reduce to the minimum even major visits abroad and 
makes them mainly over weekends leaving weekdays for tackling 
domestic problems tass said such visits are essential it said 
because gorbachev remains the soviet unions only politician with 
whom western leaders agree to do business

the senate ethics committee today opened 
politicallycharged hearings into links between five senators and 
the owner of a failed savings and loan and the panels chairman 
bluntly told the lawmakers that many people believe you sold your 
office 
four of the socalled keating five looked on as sen howell 
heflin said many of our fellow citizens apparently believe that 
your services were bought by charles keating that you were bribed 
that you sold your office that you traded your honor and your good 
names for contributions and other benefits 
sens john mccain a republican from arizona and democrats john 
glenn of ohio donald w riegle jr of michigan and dennis 
deconcini of arizona each listened intently as heflin spoke in his 
gravely southern accent sen alan cranston dcalif who is 
undergoing prostate cancer treatment did not attend all five deny 
any wrongdoing 
committee counsel robert bennett jostled a boxed puzzle before 
the committee members as he began his opening statement saying he 
would provide them with a picture that later pieces of evidence 
would fill in 
bennett said cranston deconcini and riegle were important 
players in helping keating in his allout war with federal 
regulators he said mccain and glenn played lesser roles 
bennett said he did not contend it was improper for the senators 
to hold meetings with federal regulators but that it was up to the 
panel to decide whether their actions were improper he said 
there can be no doubt that the intent of each of the five 
senators was to help keating when they met with federal regulators 
in 1987 
the five senators received a total of 13 million in campaign 
contributions or donations to their favored causes from keating and 
his associates all contacted federal regulators on behalf of 
keating at a time when the government was considering whether to 
seize the lincoln savings and loan association an irvine 
califbased thrift institution 
the thrift later collapsed at an estimated cost to the taxpayers 
of 2 billion 
heflin told the five they would have the chance to say whether 
the donations influenced your actions in any way 
he said lawmakers activities legitimately include helping their 
constituents and overseeing government institutions and added that 
there is room for disagreement about conclusions in the case 
bennett said the evidence will be clear despite the refusal of 
keating to answer questions during the senate inquiry keating has 
been indicted in california on state securities fraud charges and 
is awaiting trial 
one could ask the question if mr keating were here would 
you believe what he had to say anyway bennett said 
the five senators have become a symbol of the massive savings 
industry collapse and the outcome of the ethics hearings could 
intensify the political ramifications of what so far has been a 
bipartisan scandal 
in addition the case has highlighted a political system that 
gives lawmakers great latitude in contacting federal regulators on 
behalf of constituents at the same time they are dependent on 
campaign contributions to mount their political campaigns 
the hearings stemmed from a complaint last year by the citizens 
group common cause its not just the five senators but the whole 
senate whose integrity and credibility is on the line said fred 
werthheimer the organizations leader 
heflin and others on the panel said the case should not create a 
standard that bars members of congress from intervening with 
federal agencies on behalf of constituents or campaign

a standard of conduct which would preclude members of congress 
from intervening on behalf of individuals who happened to have 
contributed to or raised funds for their campaign is nonsensical 
and unworkable under existing law said sen warren rudman 
rnh 
sen trent lott rmiss another member of the committee 
complained that panel has taken too long with the case we should 
have already taken certain actions he said 
heflin dala defended the panels decision to hold the 
hearings against charges of partisanship on all the votes taken 
by the committee not one was divided along partisan lines he 
said 
with documents stacked several inches high on a table covered 
with green felt heflin framed the issue that the ethics panel will 
have to grapple with 
the allegation in this case that an individual used his 
wealth to get preferential treatment from government officials in 
the performance of their official duties raises questions which 
are as old as history and issues that bear on the balance of power 
among the branches of the federal government 
the committee could vote to rebuke any of the five or recommend 
a more serious punishment to the full senate 
each senator has denied any connection between keatings money 
and their meetings with regulators the basic issue is whether any 
violated senate rules against exerting improper influence in return 
for compensation 
all except riegle attended an april 2 1987 meeting with ed 
gray then the top thrift regulator all five attended another 
meeting a week later with san franciscobased bank examiners who 
revealed that potential criminal actions by lincoln were involved 
mccains top aide chris koch said mccain would make the case 
that he ended his friendship with keating on march 24 1987 when 
keating asked the senator to negotiate with regulators on his 
behalf 
theres no smoking gun on don riegle the michigan senators 
lawyer thomas green said before the hearing he contended that 
riegles meeting with regulators was unrelated to a fundraising 
effort keating directed for riegle 
deconcini wrote a letter to about 5000 supporters this week 
denying wrongdoing 
you may hear derogatory statements about me and my office but 
i can assure you that i have not betrayed my public trust nor do i 
intend to be intimidated from assisting constituents in their 
dealings with our government deconcini said 
glenn has said in the past that he had no discussions on behalf 
of lincoln after the 1987 meeting when regulators said criminal 
charges were possible 
cranstons spokesman murray flander said cranston contends 
i pocketed no money i broke no law i violated no senate rule 
those are undisputed facts

the citys coalition government collapsed thursday 
in a dispute over a violent police crackdown on hundreds of leftist 
squatters living in abandoned buildings 
the environmental greens party said it was bolting the twoparty 
coalition led by social democrat mayor walter momper 
the greens say they were outraged by the massive police 
crackdown over a threeday period that led to a series of violent 
clashes resulting in more than 260 injuries and about 450 arrests 
since monday 
gerd poppe a greens candidate for the bundestag the lower 
house of the german parliament said the unbelievable police 
presence triggered the violence 
but momper and other officials blamed the leftists veteran 
radicals from former west berlins anarchist scene who are adept at 
making firebombs and staging urban guerrilla attacks 
hundreds have moved into rundown vacant tenements in former 
east berlin 
berliners will elect a new city government on dec 2 when 
elections will also be held to elect a united german government 
momper likely would govern with a minority until then the 
greens move is seen as largely a symbolic gesture of protest 
city officials began evicting leftist radicals on monday a huge 
protest turned into a rockthrowing spree that resulted in 160 
injuries and 20 arrests 
on wednesday police moved into mainzer street where radicals 
were living in 12 large tenement buildings 
police bolstered by crack paramilitary troops from the federal 
border patrol rolled in wednesday morning with armored personnel 
carriers and bulldozers and evicted the radicals 
the radicals responded with firebombs and rocks about 325 
people were reported arrested and more than 100 were injured 
tens of thousands of people marched through berlin on wednesday 
night to protest the raid and the lack of affordable housing in 
berlin later some protesters began throwing rocks and firebombs 
at police police said about 100 people were arrested 
the crackdown on squatters in berlin triggered sympathy protests 
in other cities wednesday night police reported a rash of window 
smashings and other vandalism along with graffiti expressing 
sympathy for the squatters in the cities of cologne wuppertal 
duesseldorf and muenster during the night 
affordable housing has long been a problem in wealthy western 
germany where people who make lowerthanaverage wages often have 
a difficult time finding adequate housing germany has one of the 
highest standards of living in the world 
many of eastern berlins squatters are westerners who have taken 
advantage of the general laxness of government and law enforcement 
in the eastern side of the city since east germans overthrew their 
communist rulers last year 
momper on wednesday accused the conservative federal government 
of chancellor helmut kohl of neglecting berlins housing problem 
made worse as west germany assumed responsibility for decayed 
housing in the east 
also thursday the government said it planned to send more 
police into former east germany to curb growing violence at soccer 
games 
the clashes which began after unification oct 3 came after 
years of relatively peaceful league matches disturbed only by 
occasional rightist skinheads in the west 
earlier this month however police shot and killed a soccer fan 
during one rampage in leipzig last weekend riots erupted in two 
eastern german cities after league matches 
chief of staff rudolf seiters did not say how troops would be 
dispatched to try to maintain order but the disappearance of the 
germangerman frontier has freed up hundreds of specially trained 
border guards for other law enforcement duties

the sovietled warsaw pact will stop 
functioning as a military alliance next july a hungarian foreign 
ministry official said thursday 
there is now consensus to end the sixnation organizations 
military functions july 1 said the official istvan koermendi 
this includes ending the multilateral agreements on the basis of 
which the pact functioned 
the pact which began to crumble with last years democratic 
changes in eastern europe has lost any real role as a 
counterweight to the north atlantic treaty organization 
polands deputy defense minister janusz onyszkiewicz said in 
warsaw that the common position of poland czechoslovakia and 
hungary was to work toward abolition of the pacts joint military 
command and staff 
at the moment these institutions do not function 
onyszkiewicz said they are completely frozen and our armed 
forces are under absolute control of the polish command and the 
polish political authorities 
but he said at a news conference that no date had been set to 
disband the alliance this does not mean a verdict on the 
warsaw pact has been issued that it will be dissolved within the 
next few months 
onyszkiewicz said a date could be fixed at an upcoming pact 
summit koermendi said top leaders from the pact nations would 
probably meet in budapest before the end of the year possibly in 
early december 
hungarian officials had earlier said in private that the pact 
would disband as a military alliance by next summer describing its 
future role as a loose political forum 
but koermendi appeared to be the first warsaw pact official to 
publicly announce a date for the end of its military role he first 
mentioned july 1 on wednesday to parliaments foreign relations 
committee and then again in an interview thursday 
the pact formed in 1955 in the early years of the cold war 
menaced the west into the late 1980s 
originally comprised of the soviet union albania bulgaria 
czechoslovakia east germany hungary poland and romania it was 
reduced to seven nations after albania withdrew in 1968 following 
the pact invasion of czechoslovakia and a long ideological feud 
with moscow 
the unification of the germanys left only six member nations 
that often advocate positions closer to the west than moscow 
the 16nation nato and the warsaw pact formally plan to end 
their adversarial relationship next week at a 34nation summit of 
the conference on european security and cooperation 
secretary of state james a baker iii said wednesday the 22 
countries belonging to the two alliances will sign a 
nonaggression declaration which will in a sense bury the cold 
war hatchet 
another treaty to be signed in paris reduces nonnuclear forces 
in europe

leningrads city council voted thursday to join 
the growing list of soviet cities rationing food while the united 
states and other western nations considered sending emergency aid 
starting dec 1 leningrad will ration meat poultry butter 
flour and other staples for the first time since the nazis 
blockaded it during world war ii 
rationing also had been under debate in moscows city council 
but it decided thursday to delay taking action 
as the countrys economic crisis deepens the list of cities 
rationing food and the number of goods they restrict has been 
increasing rapidly 
ration coupons are now in use in many cities across russia and 
the ukraine meat sugar and vodka are the mostly commonly 
restricted items eggs butter and flour are also rationed in some 
areas 
in kharkov a ukrainian city of 16 million people 
demonstrators blocked streets this week to protest rationing and 
the lack of basic foods in state stores the government newspaper 
izvestia said thursday 
no starvation or even chronic hunger has been reported but as 
the country moves toward a market economy goods have disappeared 
from state stores and prices in private farmers markets have risen 
fast squeezing retirees and other people with fixed incomes 
in a public opinion poll published wednesday in the weekly 
moscow news 62 percent of those questioned said they fear hunger 
will begin in the soviet union in the next few months 
the survey was conducted in october by the allunion center for 
study of public opinion one of the nations most respected 
pollsters it queried 1356 people in 11 regions no margin of 
error was given 
in germany chancellor helmut kohl said thursday his country was 
ready to send emergency supplies if needed he also said he would 
urge all western industrial nations to prepare to help the soviet 
union and eastern european countries especially in view of the 
severe winter looming 
in washington officials said the us government was 
considering airlifting food and medical supplies to the soviet 
union 
leningrad mayor anatoly sobchak one of the nations leading 
reformist politicians pushed hard for his citys rationing 
program without it he warned monday the city of nearly 5 million 
people could face hunger and civil unrest this winter 
in recent weeks leningrad residents have had to stand in 
twoand threehour lines for bread many other necessities 
including eggs sugar cheese and sausage have virtually 
disappeared from stores according to maxim korzhov a leningrad 
journalist covering the city council session 
people here are upset and worried about food korzhov said 
the atmosphere is tense 
hunger is an intensely emotional and politically volatile 
subject in leningrad because of the 19411944 siege when an 
estimated 600000 people died many from starvation 
korzhov said public support for rationing increased after stores 
throughout the city ran out of bread on nov 5 and 6 when 
residents stocked up for the nov 7 holiday the 73rd anniversary 
of the bolshevik revolution 
for decades bread has been cheap wholesome and plentiful 
throughout the soviet union ensuring that even the poorest 
segments of the population students pensioners and the disabled 
would not go hungry 
this year bread has periodically become scarce in many cities 
including moscow 
the soviet unions food problem stems not only from inadequate 
harvests but also from inefficient transportation packaging and 
distribution by some estimates 15 percent to 20 percent of many 
crops is lost to spillage spoilage and theft 
food supplies to big cities particularly in the north also 
have been disrupted this year by the countrys political 
fragmentation some of the most fertile republics including 
armenia georgia and the baltic states have stopped shipping meat 
dairy products citrus or other items outside their borders 
the leningrad soviet or city council voted 296 to 10 with 68 
abstentions to allot each resident a monthly ration of 26 pounds 
of meat 11 pounds of poultry and 22 pounds of sausage 
in addition each person will be allocated 10 eggs 11 pounds 
of butter 22 pounds of dry cereal or pasta 11 pounds of flour 
and 11 ounces of vegetable oil 
leningrad the nations secondlargest city already issues 
coupons for 44 pounds of sugar two bottles of vodka and two 
bottles of wine per person those rations will remain in effect 
residents will be able to buy their allotments at state 
subsidized prices which are quite low 45 to 650 for every 22 
pounds of meat 2 for 10 eggs 650 for 22 pounds of butter 
if leningrad residents want more than their rationed amounts 
they will have to pay market prices which are often 10 times 
higher the city council voted to remove price restrictions on food 
sold in state stores without ration coupons

nato and warsaw pact negotiators reached 
agreement thursday on a treaty cutting nonnuclear weapons in 
europe ending decades of cold war discord between the military 
alliances 
senior diplomats said negotiators from the 22 nations comprising 
both alliances had agreed on a final text for the most sweeping 
weapons accord in history and had sent the treaty to their capitals 
for approval 
lastminute objections from home were not expected the 70page 
english text was to be translated into the five other official 
languages for initialing sunday by delegation heads the officials 
said 
the texts were to be formally signed a day later by heads of 
states gathered in paris for the 34nation conference on security 
and european cooperation the monday deadline had put the vienna 
negotiators under the gun 
we actually had consensus on the big issues since the 
beginning of october said hungarys chief negotiator ambassador 
istvan gyarmati but some relatively minor details needed ironing 
out 
the treaty covers an area from the atlantic ocean to the ural 
mountains in the soviet union it sets ceilings on nonnuclear 
weapons systems regulates troop movements and permits mutual 
inspections to verify that the terms of the treaty are not being 
contravened 
negotiators originally had also sought agreement on troop 
reductions but participants agreed to suspend that track so the 
treaty could be ready for signing at the paris summit 
delegates were to reconvene in vienna nov 29 to discuss cuts in 
personnel 
but a formal pledge in september by germany to maintain no more 
than 375000 troops after unification on oct 3 eased fears of the 
soviet union which lost millions of people during world war ii 
delegates in vienna said the issue of troop cuts had become 
relatively unimportant 
the importance of numbers of soldiers declines if they dont 
have a gun to fire said a negotiator with one nation in the 
16member north atlantic treaty organization he spoke on condition 
of anonymity 
the treaty limits each side to 20000 main battle tanks 30000 
armored combat vehicles 20000 pieces of artillery 6800 combat 
aircraft and 2000 attack helicopters 
those ceiling were agreed on earlier and a negotiator from a 
warsaw pact country said lastminute differences were relatively 
arcane 
there were things like a clearer definition of the southern 
leningrad military district another delegate said on condition 
of anonymity 
the negotiations formally known as the conventional force 
europe talks began march 9 1989 after nato and the warsaw pact 
decided to scrap earier negotiations aimed at cutting conventional 
troops and arms in central europe 
those talks were a victim of the cold war little substantive 
progress was reached in 17 years of wrangling over a wide range of 
issues including existing troop strengths and means of 
verification 
nato figures published two months before the new talks began 
listed the following figures for the two military alliances 
main battle tanks warsaw pact 51500 nato 16424 
armored combat vehicles warsaw pact 22400 nato 4153 
artillery warsaw pact 43400 nato 14458 
helicopters warsaw pact 3700 nato 2419 
combat aircraft warsaw pact 8250 nato 3977 
but at the new talks the two sides decided to concentrate on 
target strengths and ignore how many soldiers and weapons each side 
had in an effort to avoid past deadlocks 
soviet political and economic reforms which fed warming 
superpower relations in the past year gave the current talks even 
more impetus and led to the swift progress that had eluded previous 
attempts to limit weapons 
the end of communist rule in moscows former european satellites 
this year also hastened the vienna negotiations with former soviet 
vassal states acting with increasing independence 
hungarian officials said thursday that the warsaw pact reduced 
to six members with the unification of germany would cease its 
military activities by july

president bush saying every american 
deserves to breathe clean air on thursday signed an extensive 
overhaul of the nations antipollution law to curb acid rain 
urban smog and toxic chemicals 
susan merrow president of the sierra club described the clean 
air act of 1990 as a breath of fresh air after a 10year smog 
alert 
bush said the bill which updates and tightens federal air 
pollution standards for the first time since 1977 was simply the 
most significant air pollution legislation in our nations 
history 
this bill means cleaner cars cleaner power plants cleaner 
factories and cleaner fuels and it means a cleaner america 
bush said at a packed white house ceremony 
the goal of the legislation is to cut acid rain pollutants by 
half sharply reduce urban smog and eliminate most of the toxic 
chemical emissions from industrial plants by the turn of the 
century 
the cost of adhering to the regulations is expected to be as 
much as 25 billion a year 
environmental groups temporarily put aside their differences 
with the president on other issues to praise his effort on clean 
air but they said the effectiveness of the legislation would 
require aggressive implementation and enforcement by the federal 
government 
richard ayers chairman of the national clean air coalition 
called the legislation cause for celebration and hope 
but ruth caplan executive director of environmental action 
said bushs signature marked only the first step toward cleaning 
up our air there are dozens of provisions that must be implemented 
through regulation 
industry representatives facing large compliance costs were 
more muted in their approval 
while business supports the acts clean air objectives its 
costs to american consumers and workers cannot be sugarcoated 
said william d fay administrator of the clean air working group 
a coalition of 2000 businesses and trade associations 
bushs signature capped a decadelong debate over antipollution 
rules the legislation was the product of 16 months of intensive 
wrangling among administration and congressional negotiators over 
myriad technical provisions 
the new law requires tougher emission controls on cars and 
requires service stations to sell cleanerburning gas it mandates 
new equipment in thousands of businesses and factories to capture 
smogcausing pollutants and toxic chemicals 
it also requires coalburning power plants to cut in half sulfur 
dioxide emissions which cause acid rain 
some of the new requirements will begin to be phased in within a 
few years but most wont be fully in place until the end of the 
decade some cities with the worst smog problems have as long as 15 
to 20 years to meet federal air requirements 
bush fulfilling a campaign promise proposed in july 1989 a 
broad rewrite of the clean air laws earlier efforts to revamp the 
laws had been blocked by strong opposition from economic and 
regional interests and the reagan administration 
no american should have to drive out of town to breathe clean 
air bush said every city in america should have clean air 
with this legislation i firmly believe we will every american 
expects and deserves to breathe clean air 
but while some environmentalists praised the president for the 
clean air legislation others were harshly critical of his 
opposition to designating antarctica a wilderness preserve such 
action would bar mineral and oil explorations 
the alliance for antarctica urged the united states to change 
its position as a multination conference began in antarctica

the number of people with diabetes rose 17 
percent in the united states during 198087 an increase federal 
health researchers attributed thursday to the aging of america 
the largest increase was among white males though diabetes 
remains most prevalent among black females the centers for disease 
control said in its weekly report 
in a related report by the cdc a study of diabetes in 198889 
found that it was most prevalent in eastern states with the 
highest rate in the district of columbia diabetes was least 
prevalent in montana 
the 38state study of prevalence by race and sex found that 
during the sevenyear period the number of white males with 
diabetes mellitus the most common form of the condition increased 
33 percent from 21 million to 28 million the increase among 
black females was 24 percent and black males 16 percent white 
females remained unchanged 
minorities continue to be more susceptible to diabetes the cdc 
said in 1987 for example the prevalence among black females was 
more than twice that among white females 509 cases per 1000 
black females compared with 234 per 1000 white females 
prevalence among black males was about onethird higher than for 
white males the cdc said 
for the nation as a whole the cdc said diabetes increased from 
58 million people in 1980 to 68 million people in 1987 
the cdcs estimates were based on selfreported cases which 
health officials believe is about half the total cases the report 
was based on a household survey of 120000 us residents who were 
asked if anyone in the family had diabetes during the previous 12 
months 
most of it the increase is explained by the aging of the 
us said david olson a statistician with the atlantabased 
cdcs center for chronic disease prevention and health promotion 
which prepared the report 
now theres a higher proportion of people with greater age 
olson said with increased age there is a higher frequency of 
diabetes 
olson said health officials are not sure why diabetes occurs 
more among minority groups though some believe it is because 
blacks hispanics and indians tend to have less access to 
preventive medicine 
dr jeff newman an epidemiologist at the cdcs chronic disease 
branch said the higher incidence of diabetes among minorities 
probably explained the regional differences in the statebystate 
study 
the states that have large proportions of these groups do have 
a higher prevalence he said 
newman said the state study was primarily for help in planning 
local prevention programs and he cautioned against drawing any 
conclusions about anything in the states themselves that might be

as the most sweeping arms reduction treaty in 
history awaited president bushs signature us officials on 
thursday registered concern about the transfer of thousands of 
soviet tanks to siberia from eastern europe 
the officials stressed that the tanks and other equipment 
shifted east of the ural mountains could not be excluded from the 
cutbacks required by the conventional forces in europe treaty 
but they said the soviets had given assurances that some of the 
weapons were destroyed and most of the rest would be put to the 
torch 
the treaty is to be signed on monday in paris by bush soviet 
president mikhail s gorbachev and the leaders of 20 other nato and 
warsaw pact countries 
it is the most ambitious arms control accord in history and was 
aimed at reducing cold war tensions between east and west even 
before the treatys conclusion the soviets under gorbachev 
undertook major reductions in eastern and central europe the 
treaty makes many of these cutbacks legally binding 
with the signing deadline only four days away us officials 
said some details still had to be ironed out they mostly concern 
procedures to verify that the reductions in tanks antiaircraft 
artillery armored personnel carriers aircraft and helicopters are 
carried out 
diplomats in vienna said however that negotiators for the two 
military alliances had reached tentative agreement on treaty terms 
the treaty will allow nato and the warsaw pact each to keep 
20000 battle tanks 30000 armored combat vehicles 20000 pieces 
of artillery 6800 combat aircraft and 2000 attack helicopters 
the cutbacks are far deeper on the warsaw pact side and in that 
sense represents a triumph for the bush administration 
but the transfer of soviet tanks and other arms east of the ural 
mountains beyond the 25 million square miles covered by the 
treaty drew attention here even though the main us goals had 
been accomplished 
this is not a new issue a senior us official told 
reporters at the white house we have made it clear to the soviet 
union from the beginning that since the treaty deals only with 
europe we wanted to ensure there would be no buildup in the soviet 
union east of the urals that would circumvent the treaty 
at the same time the official said the bush administration had 
put pressure on the soviets to withdraw their forces from eastern 
europe as a result tanks and other weapons were pulled back to 
siberia 
that positions them beyond the area where eastwest tensions 
were high and where the united states wanted soviet weapons held to 
a minimum 
on sunday the day before the treaty signing the two alliances 
will exchange information about the size of their nonnuclear 
arsenals assigned to europe then over 40 months they will be 
obliged to destroy all weapons above the ceilings set by the 
treaty 
the restriction applies to material assigned to the european 
arsenal that may have been moved elsewhere including the tanks in 
siberia and tanks and other nonnuclear weapons the united states 
has sent to the persian gulf in a military buildup designed to 
force iraq to withdraw from kuwait 
obviously we are concerned about movements to the east of the 
urals said the senior official whose identity was shielded 
under white house briefing rules the soviet union has assured us 
that some of the equipment has already been destroyed and that much 
of the rest will be destroyed 
the treaty will establish inspection procedures and other ways 
of monitoring the cutbacks are carried out the official 
acknowledged that soviet territory east of the ural mountains would 
not be covered but he said the united states had other detection 
means of making sure the soviets do not store tanks and other arms 
in excess of treaty ceilings

the son of interior secretary manuel 
lujan jr was ordered held without bail thursday on a charge of 
raping a woman whose apartment he was accused of entering while 
armed with a shotgun 
prosecutor randy sengel argued during a brief court hearing that 
robert jeffrey lujan 28 posed a danger to society and should not 
be allowed to remain free on bond 
sengel also said lujan known as jeff had been convicted in 
1983 on a federal charge of cocaine possession 
alexandria judge daniel oflaherty revoked the 2000 bond on 
which lujan had been released several hours after his arrest 
wednesday night 
the judge scheduled a preliminary hearing for friday 
lujan who did not enter a plea is charged with raping a 
48yearold woman who lives in the same highrise apartment 
building where he resides with his parents police said 
the woman told police she was awakened about 430 am sunday by 
a man carrying a shotgun authorities said there was no sign of 
forced entry into the womans apartment according to the police 
report 
defense lawyer robert stanley powell said jeff lujan was invited 
to the womans apartment for a drink on saturday night and the two 
had sex 
they had both been drinking they met up in the elevator and 
she invited him in for a drink powell said the only issue 
here is one of consent 
interior department spokesman steve goldstein said lujan was 
with his parents at their apartment when he was arrested at 8 pm 
wednesday 
the younger lujan a house painter had recently moved back into 
his parents apartment in this washington suburb goldstein said 
lujan kept to his normal schedule thursday 
goldstein said the secretary didnt go to the jail wednesday 
night or to thursdays hearing because he didnt want to be seen as 
trying to influence the outcome of the case 
it is difficult for the lujans goldstein said any other 
parents would have the opportunity to plead for their child the 
secretary recognizes that he is not any other parent 
the lujans love their son and they are going to stand by 
him goldstein said 
jeff lujan one of the secretarys four children was sentenced 
in 1983 to an unspecified term as a youthful offender for 
possession of cocaine and use of a telephone in a drug transaction 
in new mexico at the time his father was a republican congressman 
from the state 
he served was imprisoned for several months at a federal 
facility in englewood colo goldstein said 
he originally had been charged with two counts each of cocaine 
possession and trafficking but pleaded guilty to the two 
possession charges under a deal with federal prosecutors 
his lawyer said jeff lujan also was convicted in 1987 of driving 
while intoxicated and driving with a suspended license and served a 
oneyear prison term 
at the time of the 1983 sentencing lujan said his son was being 
treated for a big alcohol problem that came to light when he 
was arrested on the drug charges

presidents hosni mubarak of egypt and hafez 
assad of syria on thursday effectively killed efforts to bring arab 
leaders together in an emergency summit aimed at averting war in 
the persian gulf 
the two leaders said they rejected king hassan of moroccos call 
for a summit because iraq insisted on holding onto kuwait on 
wednesday saudi arabia said it would not participate unless 
baghdad promised beforehand that it would leave kuwait 
hassan proposed the summit sunday as a possible last chance 
for peace 
mubarak returning thursday from a visit to libya and syria 
stressed that no one wants war and he said he would continue 
to make every effort to find a peaceful solution to the crisis 
rather than open the doors of hell 
the egyptian leader also said he had asked president bush to 
wait for three months before turning to military action to force 
iraq out of kuwait he did not say when he made the request 
in damascus a statement released by assads office said the two 
presidents expressed their regret for iraqs rejection of any 
political settlement that aims at restoring the situation in kuwait 
to what it was prior to aug 2 
both egypt and syria have contributed to arab forces among the 
usled multinational force confronting iraq which numbers about 
300000 
assad and mubaraks statement effectively killed any chance of 
the summit taking place despite the fact the fact that a few arab 
league members including sudan and the palestine liberation 
organization had agreed to moroccos proposal 
kuwaits governmentinexile also rejected the idea thursday 
egypts middle east news agency said mubarak told editors 
traveling with him that he would undertake every possible 
effort to find a peaceful solution to the crisis 
hassans proposal had raised interest in moscow and soviet 
president mikhail s gorbachev sent envoys to the region to sound 
out leaders on the idea 
but mubaraks chief political aide osama elbaz said after a 
meeting thursday in cairo with soviet envoy alexander bologonov 
that the possibility of a peaceful solution is getting smaller 
every day 
iraq itself has said it would attend a summit on condition that 
earlier arab league calls for its withdrawal from kuwait be 
scrapped 
twelve arab league members including egypt and the gulf states 
voted at a summit in august to condemn the invasion of kuwait and 
approve the dispatch of foreign forces to defend saudi arabia 
iraq libya and the plo voted against the resolution jordan 
sudan and mauritania had reservations and algeria and yemen

a classical music radio station asked its listeners to bust 
your butt for bernstein in honor of the late conductor a heavy 
smoker who died last month and folks with smokes nationwide tried 
to stop their tokes thursday 
as part of the 14th annual great american smokeout the first 50 
listeners to call new york city station wncnfm and pledge to quit 
for the day received a compact disc of leonard bernsteins 
greatest hits 
antismoking advocates maintain that the effort to get people to 
kick the habit for a day has seen such romantic images as the 
marlboro man and teenage rebels fall into historys ashtray 
its a day of celebration surgeon general antonia novello 
said in washington because its a time when smokers can realize 
that the road to good health begins with one smokefree day and 
then one more and one more 
it also was a day for rallies and other events from coast to 
coast 
the american cancer society again estimated that 18 million 
smokers more than onethird of the smoking population would 
attempt to quit at least for the day of that number last year 5 
million made it through the day and 3 million managed not to smoke 
for four days or more ms novello said 
the surgeon general has called for a smokeless society by the 
year 2000 and in recent years numerous cities and counties have 
enacted restrictive smoking laws taboo too is smoking on 
domestic airline flights 
youre more socially acceptable if youre a heroin addict 
complained patty prickett a california environmentalist whos 
tried to quit smoking six times but still consumes two packs a day 
antismoking advocates and smokers rights activists staged 
separate rallies about an hour apart thursday on opposite sides of 
the ohio statehouse in columbus neither session drew large crowds 
antismoking groups objected to the philip morris cos 
sponsorship of a national tour of the bill of rights which is 
going on display monday in boston 
here you have philip morris which is literally a drugpushing 
organization profiting from drug addiction wrapping itself in the 
bill of rights ed sweda head of the bostonbased group against 
smoking pollution said in testimony before a massachusetts 
legislative committee 
philip morris is running an extensive advertising campaign and 
transporting an original copy of the bill of rights to all 50 
states to highlight the 200th anniversary of the documents 
ratification 
female doctors wearing lab coats and stethoscopes and health 
advocates in tennis whites planned to picket thursday night at 
madison square garden to protest virginia slims sponsorship of the 
womens tennis tournament there 
in north carolina the nations largest producer of fluecured 
tobacco the great american smokeout constitutes the great american 
fizzle year after year 
its always been our position that the american cancer society 
should be spending its money on cancer research and cancer 
treatments rather than public relations stunts said maura payne 
a spokeswoman with rj reynolds tobacco co in winstonsalem 
i think a lot of other states approach tobacco differently 
than we do said lisa poovey a spokeswoman for the north 
carolina chapter of the american cancer society in raleigh 
i hear of some of the things the happen in other states 
particularly with antismoking groups and think gee wed get 
mobbed if we did that here 
its been our practice in north carolina to approach smoking 
as a prohealth issue and not an antismoking issue 
one raleigh radio station gave out cold turkeys as a way of 
promoting the smokeout 
and in charlotte a smokeout supporter dressed as an 
oldfashioned cigarette girl was taking cigarettes rather than 
dispensing them smokers who handed over their cigarettes got a 
balloon gum or some other item in exchange 
for some diehards however all the hoopla was a drag 
george follman vice president of a hang glider and windsurfing 
company in newport beach calif has smoked for 20 years hes 
even smoked while hang gliding 
he quit a decade ago but returned to it after a 1981 accident 
while riding an ultralight airplane he crashed in a rice paddy but 
was unhurt 
the first thing he did when rescuers came borrow a cigarette 
his plans for the great american smokeout 
i intend to smoke my brains out he said

chancellor helmut kohl said thursday that 
germany will send emergency supplies to the soviet union in case of 
a food crisis this winter 
in washington us officials said the bush administration is 
also developing contingency plans to provide emergency food and 
medicine to the soviet union to tide it through the winter 
the announcements came on the same day that leningrads city 
council voted to begin widescale food rationing on dec 1 for the 
first time since the nazi siege in world war ii 
kohl spoke during a special session of parliament in which he 
summarized his talks last weekend with soviet president mikhail s 
gorbachev the opposition convened the session to discuss the 
persian gulf crisis 
the chancellor told legislators that during talks with gorbachev 
on friday he promised that germany would assist the soviet union 
financially to the best of our powers the talks followed the 
signing of a farreaching cooperation and nonaggression treaty 
between the two countries 
specifically he said germany would send emergency shipments of 
food to the soviet union in case of acute supply crises 
concern has grown that the soviet union could face serious 
shortages of food and other essentials this winter causing extreme 
hardship and possibly provoking civil unrest 
european commission president jacques delors earlier this week 
said the fear of famine in the soviet union is one of the european 
communitys biggest concerns a european source said it will be one 
of the main topics at an ec summit in rome on dec 1314 
in oxford england foreign secretary douglas hurd announced 
thursday that britain will provide 39 million worth of expertise 
to the soviet union over the next two years 
he said help would be given in the areas of food distribution 
and agriculture energy small business formation and financial 
services 
the foreign office also said a similar fund for eastern europe 
will be doubled to 585 million in fiscal 19912 
us officials said they are considering using us emergency 
disaster programs to help the soviets airlifting food and 
medicine and dispatching technicians to help solve transportation 
problems there is no decision yet to go ahead the officials 
stressed 
president bush is expected to discuss the situation with 
gorbachev next week during a 34nation summit meeting in paris 
the us officials said their plans for emergency aid were 
prompted in large measure by fear that internal strife may escalate 
in the soviet union its a tense moment and its anyones guess 
whether there is going to be some outandout confrontation one 
official said on condition of anonymity 
kohl also said germany would send a group of highranking 
experts to advise the soviets during the transition from a 
centrally planned socialist economy to a freemarket system 
he noted that germany has already pledged 195 billion in 
assistance to the soviet union 
kohl added that eastern europe cold also face severe shortages 
this winter and urged wealthy industrial states to be ready to 
help out he said he would raise the subject of aid during a 
meeting sunday with bush in oggersheim in southwest germany 
i will discuss with president bush how the western industrial 
lands can effectively and jointly support the reform processes in 
eastern europe especially in view of the severe winter he 
said 
kohl also appealed to residents of what used to be east germany 
to be patient with the large number of soviet troops still deployed 
there under an agreement last summer that cleared the way for 
german unification the troops are to stay until 1994 
we want the soviet soldiers and their families to feel good 
during their remaining time here kohl said 
intolerance has been growing toward the red army troops amid 
reports of rising crime and desertion among the soviet soldiers 
during the debate on the gulf crisis members of the governing 
coalition urged greater support for the us position on ending the 
conflict 
has one so quickly forgotten the solidarity the united states 
showed toward german unity asked michaela geiger a member of 
the christian social union the conservative bavarian sisterparty 
of kohls christian democrats 
the opposition social democrats led by former chancellor willy 
brandt proposed a resolution calling for maintaining international 
political and economic pressure on iraq but disavowing any use of 
force the proposal was sent to committee for study

americas dwindling grizzly bear population 
suffers from a public relations problem but can be saved from 
extinction by concerted federal and state efforts a government 
bear expert said thursday 
certainly we can do it said christopher servheen 
coordinator of grizzly bear recovery for the us fish and wildlife 
service 
timber and livestock groups have been cool to the recovery 
program he said largely because grizzly bears have a public 
relations problem they are big they are dangerous and they are 
direct competitors with man 
but servheen of missoula mont told reporters after a meeting 
designed to gather public comment on the recovery program that the 
criticism will not block efforts to save the bears 
the grizzlies went on the endangered species list in 1975 and 
the government is required to fight to save them 
theres no question that we are going to recover bears he 
said what were interested in now is public comment on how we 
plan to do that 
the grizzly bear ursus arctos horribilis once roamed western 
north america from the arctic circle into northern mexico the us 
population was once estimated at 50000 to 100000 
but the number of grizzlies in the united states has shrunk 
drastically fewer than 1000 remain 
the main reason for the decline according to federal officials 
is the shooting of bears for furs sport predator control and 
fear another is loss of habitat to farming grazing human 
settlements and water projects 
the government has no intention of placing bears in areas where 
they dont live now servheen said 
grizzlies live in yellowstone the northern continental divide 
area of montana the cabinetyaak area of montana the selkirks 
vicinity of idaho and washington and the northern cascades area of 
washington bears also might be living in the bitterroot mountains 
of idaho and the san juan mountains of colorado but none has been 
sighted lately 
one female was recently brought into the yellowstone area where 
scientists are concerned about expanding the genetic pool servheen 
said adding that the service would like to take in three more 
the service plans to keep gathering public comment on its plan 
until february and produce a final version next spring it will 
decide then whether to start fullscale recovery operations in the 
north cascades and bitterroot vicinities and whether to consider 
such action in the san juan mountains 
the 151page plan envisions differing specific goals for each of 
the ecosystems involved 
in yellowstone for example the objectives are 15 females with 
cubs over a sixyear average with the animals spread out over 15 of 
the 18 bear management units and annual known bear deaths not 
to exceed a total of seven or two adult females 
grizzlies are one of three types of bears found on this 
continent the others are the north american black bear and the 
polar bear kodiak bears close relatives of grizzlies are found 
on three islands off alaska

former contra rebels exchanged gunfire 
with police and holed up in churches in several towns thursday in a 
fastrising wave of violence that has left four police officers 
dead and 23 people wounded 
police in managua arrested a former contra leader believed to be 
involved in directing the violent rebellion that began oct 31 in 
southeastern nicaragua 
aristides sanchez herdocia a rightwing hardliner was 
political adviser to the nowdisbanded usbacked nicaraguan 
resistance and a former member of its directorate 
an interior ministry spokeswoman who demanded anonymity said 
police who raided sanchezs office early thursday found a great 
quantity of weapons and hand grenades and had other evidence 
involving him in the commission of grave crimes 
the casualties occurred late wednesday in sebaco 50 miles north 
of managua during a shootout between excontra rebels and police 
it was the most violent incident yet in a series of protests that 
appeared to be converging on the capital 
camouflaged army units with machine guns and rocket launchers 
were called in late wednesday to rout the rebels it was the first 
time the sandinista peoples army has been deployed to try to quell 
the twoweek protest 
the demobilized rebels their supporters and the mayors of 16 
towns in the region are demanding aid and land promised to the 
former contras as part of their agreement to lay down arms after a 
decade of war against the former sandinista government 
they are also demanding that president violeta chamorro who 
defeated the sandinistas in a february election fire her 
sandinista army chief and two ministers 
mrs chamorro and interior minister carlos hurtado maintained 
this week that there were dark forces manipulating the rebels 
for political purposes this was a veiled reference to mrs 
chamorros vice president virgilio godoy 
godoy whose relations with mrs chamorro have been severely 
strained has denied any behindthescenes involvement in what he 
called a beautiful civic protest 
the government said wednesday it had already distributed land to 
most of the 20000 contras who completed their demobilization in 
late june 
sebaco is an important junction connecting large towns in 
northeastern nicaragua with the panamerican highway the most 
important northsouth artery in central america 
regional police chief sergio gomez said the violence in sebaco 
began after about 300 rebel protesters placed boulders and trash 
across the panamerican highway late wednesday 
he said police tried for more than three hours to persuade the 
former rebels to clear the road an interior ministry communique 
said the talks were conducted in the presence of representatives of 
cardinal miguel obando y bravo and the organization of american 
states regional mission 
gomez said police began throwing tear gas at the blockade when 
the negotiations failed the protesters responded by throwing two 
hand grenades and then opened fire with combat weapons 
four police officers were killed and 16 wounded in the ensuing 
shootout seven civilians also were wounded gomez said 
he said an undetermined number of the former rebels fled west of 
the town and army units were called in the 200 soldiers gained 
control of the town thursday while additional army units chased 
the rebels through the brush 
an army intelligence source said an estimated 500 former contras 
had also gathered in the area around waslala a town in northern 
nicaragua near the honduran border 
also thursday radio stations reported that demobilized contras 
were holed up in a church and the city hall building in granada 
nicaraguas secondlargest city 30 miles southeast of managua 
another group had taken over a church telephone building bank 
and other public offices in nagarote 30 miles northwest of 
managua

the head of the national conference of 
catholic bishops on thursday told president bush that a military 
offensive against iraq at this point could violate the churchs 
just war standards 
in a letter delivered to the white house archbishop daniel e 
pilarczyk of cincinnati wrote 
because of the serious moral and human factors involved we 
ask you to intensify the determined and creative pursuit of a 
peaceful solution that seeks to bring justice to the region without 
resort to war 
the letter was dispatched after a closeddoor discussion of 
issue at the annual meeting of us bishops here 
citing the churchs ageold criteria of just war that its 
probable gains outweigh the resulting costs in lives that civilian 
areas not be targeted and that war be a last resort pilarczyk 
said 
i fear that in this situation moving beyond the deployment 
of military forces in an effort to deter iraqi aggression to the 
undertaking of offensive military action could well violate these 
criteria especially the principles of proportionality and last 
resort 
repeating earlier condemnation by the annual meeting of bishops 
here of iraqs aggression hostagetaking and violation of human 
rights and support for peaceful pressure on iraq pilarczyk wrote 
we urge our government and our allies to continue to pursue 
the course of peaceful pressure and not to resort to war 
he said that considering the dangers and human costs which 
could be the result of war in the persian gulf the nation needs 
to continue to assess and discuss the ethical dimensions of this 
difficult situation

simon amp schuster on thursday for the publishers 11thhour decision 
to ax his new novel about a serial killer who mutilates women 
saying it smacks of censorship 
if all this had been brought up 11 months ago i would not say 
that ellis said but when it comes this late in the game and 
it seems that it was done just because marvin davis does not 
respond to this kind of fiction then it is censorship 
ellis was referring to the head of paramount communications 
inc simon amp schusters parent company the publishing house 
announced wednesday it would not print ellis third novel 
american psycho 
simon amp schuster spokeswoman barbara reno said the company would 
not comment on ellis charges 
chairman richard e snyder told the washington post he was not 
pressured by paramount he said he learned of the violent contents 
of the book only recently and said editors who bought it made an 
incorrect decision 
it was i who decided we should not put our name on this book 
its a matter of taste snyder said he said paramount agreed 
with his decision 
i think it would have been a matter of taste if this had been 
raised or discussed 12 months ago when the final draft was first 
handed in not after jackets were printed up the book typeset 250 
bound galleys made said ellis whose previous novels less 
than zero and the rules of attraction were also published by 
simon amp schuster 
american psycho had a january publication date and was 
scheduled to be shipped to stores next month 
ellis book which includes graphic passages of women being 
dismembered and cannibalized was criticized recently in spy and 
time magazines 
my response to both those pieces was that they verged on the 
hysterical mostly because the reviewers concentrated on 40 or less 
pages of a 400page novel concentrating on 10 percent of the book 
while ignoring the other 90 
i think it distorted what the book is really about and in some 
strange way gave the impression that i was endorsing this kind of 
violence which if you read the book is clearly not the case 
said the 26yearold author 
ellis said simon amp schusters action means the end of their 
relationship its kind of sad ive been with them since 1984 
and im very close friends with my editor there but i dont think 
there is any chance i would ever publish another book there 
again 
ellis publicist amanda urban said she is negotiating with 
several other publishers who expressed interest in the book she 
would not elaborate 
urban said ellis gets to keep his advance a source involved 
with the contract who spoke on condition of anonymity said the 
advance was 300000

a proposal to change the butterfat formula 
used in determining milk prices paid to farmers is under 
consideration the agriculture department said thursday 
daniel d haley administrator of the departments agricultural 
marketing service said the proposed change is based on the 
unanimous wishes of major sectors of the dairy industry that 
testified a national hearing on july 31 in alexandria va 
the proposal if adopted would reduce the value of butterfat in 
the pricing formula used under all federal milk marketing orders 
paying dairy farmers less for the butterfat in the milk they 
sell to processors will recognize the lowered value of butterfat in 
todays marketplace caused by consumers changing preferences 
haley said 
currently butterfat in milk is given a value according to a 
butterfat differential based on a fat content of 35 percent 
milk with a higher percentage of butterfat gets a higher prices 
and milk with a lower percentage gets a lower price 
the differentials are gauged in increments of onetenth of 1 
percent 
haley said the new formula would benefit milk wholesalers or 
handlers under federal milk marketing orders the handlers now 
are paying farmers one price for the butterfat in their milk but 
can only sell surplus butterfat to butter plants at a lower price 
under the new formula handlers would pay less for the 
butterfat but would increase the value of skim milk haley said 
the overall net income to dairy farmers will remain the same 
but use of the new formula is contingent on milk producers 
approving the plan he said producer approval will be determined 
through six federal marketing order referendums 
the federal marketing orders are a system used to set minimum 
prices for milk that dealers must pay farmers although the orders 
do not set retail milk prices the minimums specified at the farm 
are felt throughout the marketing chain 
officials said details of the proposed pricing formula will be 
published in the federal register the governments rulemaking 
document on nov 19 
the agency said copies of the proposal are available from any 
federal milk marketing order office or from ams usda dairy 
division order formulation branch room 2968 po box 96456

an italian official told a parliamentary inquiry on 
thursday that the soviet bloc learned years ago about a network of 
secret resistance groups in europe reportedly set up with nato and 
cia aid 
the western public is only learning now about the anticommunist 
network 
adm fulvio martini chief of military intelligence service 
testified on the opening day of the inquiry that the other side 
found out about the operation through its own spies 
they surely knew about gladio for a simple reason because of 
an espionage operation that had a certain importance in a nato 
country martini said without going into specifics 
martini is in charge of operation gladio the italian branch of 
the guerrilla network established at the dawn of the cold war in 
case of a soviet invasion gladio is italian for the doubleedged 
swords used by roman gladiators 
premier giulio andreotti revealed the existance of the group 
last month many european governments have admitted similar 
organizations were formed in their countries sometimes with cia 
help several groups were later put under north atlantic treaty 
organization command 
the parliamentary committee on massacres is examining whether 
operation gladio was linked to rightwing terrorism martini 
strongly denied that it was the admiral did not say exactly when 
the soviets learned about the guerrilla network 
he told the commission that warsaw pact members themselves had a 
form of operation gladio he identified it as spetnas an acronym 
for spetsialnovo naznacheniye or special forces 
but he said that unlike gladio it relied not on civilians but 
on military forces who could form a kind of fifth column in 
case of western invasion 
in poland deputy defense minister janusz onyskiewicz said that 
we did not prepare for a guerrilla fight in case of invasion by 
our country by the nato army he is a civilian appointed by the 
postcommunist government 
revelation of the european networks has prompted an outcry in 
italy 
some politicians and news media speculated gladio may have been 
behind a series of unresolved terrorist bombings that occurred from 
1969 through the early 1980s when the italian communists came to 
the brink of power most of the attacks were blamed on rightwing 
groups 
martini admitted under questioning that gladio documents 
mentioned defending against internal subversion as well as 
foreign invasion 
but he denied any gladiators were involved in illegal 
conspiracies 
the structure and national breakdown of gladio would be of 
very little use for a coup or other internal subversion he said 
of a total of 622 gladiators 70 percent were based above 
the po river near italys northern borders he said 
not one of the 622 was ever involved in any conspiracies or 
plots he said 
he said operation gladio was frozen a month ago on 
andreottis orders but that authorities had let it decline for 
years because of the reduced soviet threat 
some members were apparently being recruited even in recent 
years however the italian newsweekly europeo on thursday 
published what it said was a partial list of gladio members among 
them were a 22yearold and a 23yearold 
members of the commission said they were told the list was 
genuine 
in britain the guardian newspaper quoted gen sir anthony 
farrarhockley a former commander of nato forces in northern 
europe as saying a british group was formed to resist an invasion 
by communist forces 
the original plan was to establish a network to arm guerrillas 
from the civil populace while conventional forces were occupied 
elsewhere he was quoted as saying 
the network is said to also have had branches in germany 
france belgium the netherlands denmark norway austria spain 
greece and portugal 
in italy the resistance group was set up through a 1956 accord 
between italian secret services and the us central intelligence 
agency martini and parliamentary deputies said thursday it came 
under nato coordination three years later 
among questions raised by gladio is what happened to some of its 
139 arms caches hidden around italy martini said the contents of 
two of them were stolen 
the hearing thursday was closed to the public but reporters were 
allowed to follow the proceedings on closedcircuit television 
the broadcast was interrupted five times when the commission 
decided that certain testimony involved state secrets

the private group public citizen on thursday 
issued what it described as a clarification of a recent critical 
report on the insurance industry saying it did not mean to imply 
that the american international group was in danger of insolvency 
in a letter to aig chairman maurice r greenberg public citizen 
president joan claybrook also reiterated that public citizen finds 
no need for policyholders to switch companies because of the 
findings in its report 
aig released the letter along with a statement describing the 
public citizen report as irresponsible and objecting to any 
suggestion that its financial condition was to any degree 
imperiled or impaired it said the consumer group had 
acknowledged that any such suggestion in the report was 
neither intended nor accurate 
public citizen has previously acknowledged that it was mistaken 
in saying in the report that the property and casualty surpluses of 
aetna and the itt hartford insurance group had declined 
public citizen spokesman bob dreyfuss said the letter to aig 
however did not acknowledge any error 
we didnt make any additional changes or corrections or 
retractions at all in the report he said it was really a 
simple clarification 
the report issued on oct 15 said that five of the nations 
top 20 property and casualty companies would be subject to possible 
insolvency in the event of a severe economic downturn 
it said none of the companies was on the edge of insolvency but 
the underlying weakness in their financial condition is clearly 
evident 
the five were aetna aig hartford liberty mutual and united 
states fidelity amp guaranty the study said they each triggered four 
of six factors that by public citizens analysis would make them 
vulnerable to insolvency in an economic downturn 
one of the tests was whether they held less in surplus in 1982 
than in 1972 aetna and hartford were both listed in this category 
but the group said a later recalculation showed that their 
surpluses had actually increased during the decade consequently 
it said they should not have been on the list 
in response to a question at a news conference when the report 
was released ms claybrook said she would not advise people 
holding policies with any of the companies to change to another 
insurer instead she said they should write to their companies 
and urge corrective action 
in her letter to greenberg ms claybrook said aig has 
objected to references to it in the report public citizen did not 
suggest or intend to imply that aigs financial condition is such 
that it is in danger of becoming insolvent nor did we intend to 
cast doubt upon aigs ability to meet its obligations as public 
citizen explicitly stated when the report was released it finds no 
need for policyholders to switch companies and does not dispute the 
ratings that aig has received from moodys standard and poors and 
am best 
aigs statement said it had previously received and still holds 
the highest rating provided by each of these organizations

congress should require the alcohol and 
tobacco industries to pay for advertising to discourage teenage use 
of the gateway substances a national panel said thursday 
the national commission on drugfree schools said the campaign 
is needed because while schoolchildren have curbed their use of 
cocaine marijuana and other illegal drugs they stubbornly resist 
calls to abstain from drinking and smoking 
the panel suggested in a report that congress enact a ban on 
advertising and promotion of either or both of these products if 
the industries fail to stop targeting youth by 1992 
the report presents final conclusions of the 26member 
commission cochaired by education secretary lauro cavazos and 
william bennett the outgoing director of the national drug control 
policy on the problems of drugs in the nations school 
the key finding after nationwide field hearings involving more 
than 1700 witnesses was that while prevention efforts have had 
some impact on the use of illegal controlled drugs there has not 
been the same success in discouraging use of alcohol and tobacco 
for the past year our commission has talked to hundreds of 
students teachers and prevention specialists and all of them 
agree that alcohol is the drug of choice for young people said 
rep michael dewine rohio a commission member 
most of the kids dont realized that alcohol and tobacco are 
often gateways to other drug use he added 
the report authorized as part of the antidrug abuse act of 
1988 said illegal drug use decreased from 1981 when 66 percent of 
seniors acknowledged use of an illicit drug to a 51 percent rate 
in 1989 
marijuana use within the previous 30 days among high school 
seniors declined from 37 percent in 1978 to 17 percent in 1989 
cocaine use within the previous 30 days among high school seniors 
declined from a high of 67 percent in 1985 to a low of 28 percent 
in 1989 
alcohol use within the previous 30 days among high school 
seniors declined from 72 percent in 1978 to 60 percent in 1989 the 
report said children as young as thirdgraders have used alcohol 
and tobacco 
data from recent national surveys of high school seniors 
indicate that about 19 percent reported having smoked cigarettes 
and about 9 percent reported having drunk alcoholic beverages by 
the sixth grade about 33 percent of these students reported 
having been drunk by the sixth grade 
alcohol and tobacco pose serious health hazards to young 
people said the report alcoholrelated traffic accidents are 
the leading cause of death among young people 
among its recommendations it said the amount of funds from 
the alcohol and tobacco industries should be sufficient to develop 
and operate a substantial public education program to balance the 
messages that have the effect of encouraging young people to drink 
and smoke 
the counteradvertising campaigns could serve as remedial 
education for young people who have been influenced to use these 
drugs by exposure to advertising and promotion from these 
industries over the years

senelect paul wellstone has made it clear 
that the senate tradition of sidestepping personal attacks on 
fellow senators will not affect his antagonism toward his new 
colleague jesse helms 
wellstone a liberal democrat from minnesota said he has been 
an opponent of the conservative north carolina republican since he 
first heard helms while studying at the university of north 
carolina in the 1960s 
i have detested him since i was 19 and moreover i think he 
won against harvey gantt on a blatantly racist campaign period 
its true wellstone said at a news conference thursday helms 
won reelection last week by narrowly defeating gantt a black 
i didnt come here to washington to start talking differently 
than i did in minnesota 
wellstone could be serving on at least one committee with helms 
a possibility that wellstone acknowledged would be interesting 
one of wellstones top priorities is a seat on the agriculture 
committee helms is the panels former chairman and now its no 2 
republican 
i think people in minnesota expect me to come to the united 
states senate and every single time its appropriate on the floor 
of the senate or wherever to take on jesse helms and present a very 
different kind of vision of politics wellstone said 
helms who has never met wellstone responded thursday i hope 
that he will prove to be somewhat more stable otherwise hes 
going to have a difficult time in the senate 
helms bristled at wellstone remarks that helms had minimized 
the assassination of president kennedy in 1963 he went off the 
deep end helms said of wellstone

thursday they will appeal a federal agencys decision to approve 
the 370mile pipeline 
at least four groups planned to challenge the project by 
questioning the procedures used by the federal energy regulatory 
commission

western connecticut and under long island sound to long island 
the line will bring canadian natural gas to utilities and gas 
companies in new england new york and new jersey

oil and provide a cleanburning energy alternative for heating and 
electricity 
leading the opposition are domestic gas and oil prospectors and 
suppliers who say the project has been given an unfair competitive 
advantage over us energy sources 
a citizens group opposes the decision on environmental grounds 
and because of the disruption it may cause to property owners in

panel opens keating five hearing told senators helped sampl owner 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
the senate ethics committee opened triallike 
public hearings thursday on the keating five with the panels 
lawyer declaring the lawmakers helped the owner of a failing 
savings and loan fight an allout war with federal regulators 
the senators also heard committee chairman howell heflin say 
many americans believe that you were bribed that you sold your 
office that you traded your honor and your good names for 
contributions and other benefits 
special counsel robert s bennett said in his opening statement 
that sens alan cranston and dennis deconcini were important 
players in charles j keating jrs strategy to stave off federal 
rules and that sen donald w riegle jr played a much greater 
role than he now contends 
speaking in a packed hearing room bennett said sens john 
mccain and john glenn played lesser roles the lawyer spoke for 
about five hours thursday and will resume friday morning 
before bennett spoke the chairman of the sixsenator committee 
alabama democrat heflin somberly told the subjects of the inquiry 
many of our fellow citizens apparently believe that your services 
were bought by charles keating that you were bribed that you sold 
your office that you traded your honor and your good names for 
contributions and other benefits 
keating contributed 13 million to campaigns of and causes 
favored by the five senators 
while bennett denied his role was prosecutorial sen david 
pryor dark testily told him youre beginning to reach 
personal conclusions and deciding what is relevant and what is not 
relevant 
bennett responded its less my conclusion and more the 
objective evidence 
in his detailed comments bennett told the panel 
despite riegles statements that he doesnt remember such 
events keating offered to host a fundraiser for riegle at the 
businessmans detroit hotel the senator set arrangements in motion 
for an april 2 1987 meeting between the four other senators and 
the former top thrift regulator and riegle hid from his own aides 
his role in arranging that meeting and the fundraising purpose o 
a trip to keatings phoenixbased company 
cranston continued to contact federal regulators even though 
former arizona gov bruce babbitt told the senator that keating was 
a crook 
evidence shows that deconcini offered a deal on behalf of 
keating to former top thrift regulator edwin j gray despite 
deconcinis denial of a quid pro quo three other senators at the 
meeting refused to say flatly that deconcinis version was 
correct 
on glenn the lawyer knew of no evidence linking keatings 
contributions to intervention by the ohio senator 
glenn arranged and attended a lunch between keating and 
thenhouse speaker jim wright in january 1988 to discuss sampl 
problems some time after the meeting a keating aide sent glenn a 
thank you note saying speaker wrights interest was fantastic 
on mccain was there anything improper about sen mccains 
conduct the evidence discovered by the special counsel suggests 
not 
four of the five senators were present for the opening of the 
hearing in the senate hart office building cranston who said last 
week that he will undergo treatment for prostate cancer was not 
there 
the committee could vote to rebuke any of the five or to 
recommend a more serious punishment to the full senate or to take 
no action against any of them all have denied wrongdoing 
while keating was enlisting the five senators and other 
lawmakers as soldiers in his battle he was liberally doling out 
political contributions bennett said it is the committees role 
he said to determine whether that money was driving the senators 
to intervene with regulators on keatings behalf or whether they 
were providing normal constituent service 
bennett said i will give you many instances where acts and 
money were discussed at the same time and indeed hundreds of 
thousands of dollars in the case of sen cranston passed in an 
office in this building 
the lawyer held up jumbled pieces of a jigsaw puzzle and 
promised to piece together evidence in the case just as someone 
would complete the puzzle 
the committee members and bennett repeatedly described the 
hearings as a factfinding effort to determine whether the five 
senators helped keating because of the 13 million they received 
from the former thrift operator and his associates 
all five senators have contended they were helping keating as 
they would anyone whether a contributor or not who complained 
of unfair treatment by federal regulators 
for months the news media have reported that bennett 
recommended to the committee of three democrats and three 
republicans that mccain rariz and glenn dohio be dismissed 
from the case and that the investigation be intensified against 
cranston dcalif deconcini dariz and riegle dmich 
in the mid1980s when keating was fighting a rule by regulators 
limiting risky thrift investments he enlisted the support of the 
five senators and many others 
placing his hand on stacks of documents bennett said it is 
clear from the paper and testimony that cranston and deconcini were 
important players in keatings strategy 
riegle bennett said told the committee he played a minor and 
largely passive role in helping keating fight the regulators but 
he said there was substantial evidence riegle played a much 
greater role than he now recalls 
bennett said mccain and glenn did not play such large roles in 
organizing the meetings with regulators in april 1987 nor did 
they play meaningful roles following the meetings 
bennett also appeared to back previous statements by gray the 
former chief thrift regulator that the senators had offered gray a 
dealon behalf of keating 
the regulators were asked to withdraw a regulation limiting 
risky investments by thrifts at the request of a single company 
and the company would do certain things in return bennett said 
gray has testified an offer was made at the april 2 1987 
meeting he held with all of the senators except riegle according 
to gray deconcini made the offer but deconcini cranston mccain 
and glenn all denied such a quid pro quo was offered

tens of thousands of romanians rallied 
against the government thursday turning an anniversary of the 
first major protest against communist dictator nicolae ceausescu 
into a denunciation of his successors 
the rallies across romania continued late thursday night 
they were sparked by the protest three years ago in this 
southern transylvanian town 
but they were fueled by unrest over government reforms that have 
tripled food prices and by resentment over president ion iliescus 
having served as a communist official years ago under ceausescu 
demonstrators also took to the streets of the capital bucharest 
timisoara constanta ploiesti iasi and sibiu demanding iliescus 
resignation 
in bucharest up to 50000 demonstrators converged on palace 
square where protesters died in last years uprising and marched 
to government headquarters 
the protesters including many students shouted antiiliescu 
slogans and jeered the price increases thousands remained on the 
streets thursday night and about 300 demonstrators blocked traffic 
on the main boulevard 
more than 50000 people rallied in the western city of 
timisoara site of the massacre that spurred the revolution 
the center of ploiesti 38 miles north of bucharest was also 
blocked by demonstrators late thursday night 
but the focus of the rallies was brasov where thousands of 
workers marched through the city center to commemorate the nov 15 
1987 riot against ceausescu 
three years ago in brasov a man set himself afire on a hilltop 
to protest ceausescus rule workers and others later attacked and 
ransacked city hall the dread securitate secret police suppressed 
the rallies 
scores of people accused of instigating the protests were 
arrested tortured and jailed 
at thursdays rally former dissident doina cornea among the 
first to support the 1987 protests joined crowds calling for 
iliescus resignation 
we do not need hypocritical violent demagogues cornea told 
demonstrators 
sorin rosca said the newly established civic alliance opposition 
group would organize committees nationwide to seek out remaining 
securitate agents and publish names 
we are not dealing with the communist phantom but with a 
neocommunist reality he told the crowd 
iliescu promised gradual reforms and social protection after he 
won a landslide victory in may elections 
but many romanians accuse him and his national salvation front 
government of allowing oldregime officials to remain in the 
bureaucracy and of personally harboring communist tendencies 
both president and government insist they have shed their

prime minister margaret thatcher pledged thursday 
to stay on in office while fellow conservative michael heseltine 
the man who seeks to oust her said he can unify their partys 
deep divide 
they traded campaign rhetoric on the day heseltine formally 
submitted his bid for leadership of the conservative party and the 
government 
heseltine once mrs thatchers defense secretary will stand 
against her in a ballot tuesday of the 372 conservative 
legislators it marks the first serious challenge to her leadership 
since she took office 11 years ago 
after three general election victories leading the only party 
with clear policies resolutely carried out i intend to 
continue she declared in the house of commons 
she was responding to an opposition lawmaker who held up a 
5yearold newspaper in which he said shed promised to quit in 
1990 
mrs thatcher also attacked a heseltine proposal on education 
saying it would either mean a huge increase in income tax or a 
substantial reduction in monies available for other services 
heseltine has suggested education should be paid for by the 
national government not through the unpopular new percapita tax 
on property dubbed the poll tax he said thursday he would review 
the tax 
the selfmade millionaire said in an interview that he was 
inspired to make his challenge by former deputy prime minister 
geoffrey howes scathing attack on mrs thatcher in the house of 
commons tuesday 
after geoffrey made the speech you couldnt say go on 
business as usual heseltine told independent television 
there was a deep divide we have to find a way of unifying 
the party i think i could do it 
he said that despite what mrs thatcher achieved in the 1980s a 
growing number of people felt it was time to ask questions about 
the 1990s and it will need a new voice a new language a new 
approach 
earlier he was heckled at a meeting of conservative party 
workers in paisley scotland but by apparent outsiders who 
carried socialist worker placards 
heseltine snapped at them you will never solve scotlands 
problems if your only contribution to the debate is a loud mouth 
and an empty mind 
a poll of 240 conservative lawmakers conducted monday to 
thursday by press association the british news agency found 
heseltine facing a defeat it reported mrs thatcher winning 533 
percent of the vote and heseltine 192 percent but 275 percent 
refused to reveal where they stood 
heseltine needs 159 votes in the first secret ballot to force a 
runoff and says 100 lawmakers have pledged him support mrs 
thatcher needs 214 votes to win outright 
the guardian newspaper published a poll of 1446 people 
indicating mrs thatcher was still the overwhelming favorite of 
conservative party voters 
a poll of 1084 people published in the independent newspaper 
had conservatives running closer to the opposition labor party with 
heseltine as leader 
the poll indicated the tories now trailed labor by 14 percentage 
points when the poll asked how people would vote with heseltine as 
conservative leader the gap shrank to five points 
much of mrs thatchers crisis is rooted in her partys 16month 
lag behind the labor party in opinion polls mainly because of high 
inflation high interest rates and the poll tax 
division in her cabinet over her attitude toward europes moves 
toward economic integration helped precipitate the crisis in the 
party as it looks nervously toward a general election which must be 
held by mid1992 
heseltine left mrs thatchers cabinet in 1986 in a 
europerelated dispute

us and saudi arabian forces 
thursday began a sixday amphibious exercise in the persian gulf 
codenamed imminent thunder iraq called it a provocative 
act because it was close to kuwait 
the exercise involved 1000 us marines 1100 aircraft and 16 
ships including the aircraft carrier uss midway which arrived in 
the region earlier this month 
it was the largest use of aircraft in a single training exercise 
since american forces began being deployed in the region under 
operation desert shield in early august 
there have been three previous amphibious exercises in the gulf 
since iraqs aug 2 invasion of iraq but they were believed to 
have been held farther south 
while the exact location of immninent thunder was not revealed 
under military policy and a news blackout was imposed for the 
initial phases a pentagon spokesman said the exercise is centered 
in eastern saudi arabia about 100 miles from kuwait 
it is not right next to the kuwaiti border lt cmdr edward 
lundquist said late thursday in washington press reports have said 
the exercise would be 10 miles from the iraqikuwaiti border 
no live ammunition will be fired in imminent thunder 
the exercise was not intended to provoke the iraqis said us 
navy spokesman cmdr jd van sickle 
the purpose is to give participating forces training in oint 
and combined operations and to enhance amphibious warfare skills 
he said exercise imminent thunder is part of our desert shield 
training 
military officials said there was no particular significance to 
the name of the operation and that its timing was not linked to any 
operational plans 
but it is being held as the united states doubles the number of 
aircraft carriers in the gulf region to six and sends in 150000 
additional military personnel to join the estimated 230000 already 
deployed the entire usled multinational force arrayed against 
iraq numbers more than 300000 
the exercise was launched one day after british defense 
secretary tom king visited saudi arabia to discuss what 
reinforcements britain might send 
the british have 16000 personnel in the region including the 
9000man 7th desert rats armoured division which became 
operational wednesday 
king warned iraqi president saddam hussein on wednesday time 
is running out were not going to sit around forever 
adm frank b kelso the chief of naval operations who was in 
the gulf visiting the destroyer uss obrien as part of an 
inspection tour refused to answer questions about imminent 
thunder 
we dont discuss details of future operations kelso said 
he flew by helicopter out to the obrien operating off bahrain 
to help enforce un trade sanctions against iraq to force it out 
of kuwait 
kelso said the additional three aircraft carriers on their way 
means fundamentally you have doubled your firepower 
the exercise included units of the army navy air force and 
1000 members of the 4th marine expeditionary battalion it also 
included the royal saudi air force and naval and marine units 
training will consist of an amphibious landing in eastern saudi 
arabia with air cover and close air and naval support of ground 
forces 
army sgt 1st class mickey kershaw 37 of west islip ny 
said he felt it would be better to get on with the real fighting 
if there was to be any instead of doing more training 
its a waste of time he said of imminent thunder 
he said he would rather fight saddams force now than do it 
five years from now when this guy nukes me and the family i might 
have

a small earthquake early thursday in 
central oklahoma rattled nerves and caused some minor damage 
the earthquake at 545 am shook pictures off walls and knocked 
objects off tables and shelves in the area of lindsay about 35 
miles south of oklahoma city no serious damage or injuries were 
reported 
it felt weird because you could feel the building shaking i 
looked over on the wall and saw my calendar shaking said larry 
thompson program director at kblp radio in lindsay 
the oklahoma geological survey said the quake registered 36 on 
the richter scale of ground movement and was centered 5 miles north 
of lindsay a quake of magnitude 35 can cause slight damage a 
quake of magnitude 2 is the smallest normally felt by humans 
geologists said interest in the temblor could have been fueled 
by a quake projection for the new madrid fault in the midwest in 
early december 
theres no correlation whatsoever said charles mankin 
director of the oklahoma geological survey in norman 
its a completely different fault system added ken luza an 
engineering geologist at the survey 
new mexico inventor iben browning has said theres a 5050 
chance of a major earthquake along the new madrid fault which runs 
from cairo ill to marked tree ark hundreds of miles east of 
oklahoma 
most geologists have denounced brownings forecast but the 
resulting controversy has kept earthquakes on the public mind 
throughout the midwest 
mankin said quakes are common in oklahoma with a couple 
detected each week 
we rarely record them as high as 36 but a small earthquake 
in that area is not unusual he said

president bush said thursday that he ordered a 
massive increase in us military power in the persian gulf instead 
of digging in for a prolonged standoff because it is hard to keep 
public support for a longterm struggle 
i think holding public opinion forever in any country is very 
difficult to do bush said in an interview with cable news 
network on the eve of his departure for europe and the persian 
gulf 
he was answering the question why had he decided on developing 
a huge offensive capability for the possibility of a war rather 
than laying preparations for a long stay in saudi arabia while 
economic sanctions crippled iraq 
bush said he would not put it in terms of time as to how 
long he would wait for iraq to withdraw from kuwait 
i dont think this matter is going to go on forever as far as 
im concerned its not 
observing that he has probably not communicated to the public 
his objectives in the persian gulf very well bush pledged not to 
involve the country in a vietnamlike war 
i will not as commanderinchief ever put somebody into a 
military situation that we do not win ever and theres not going 
to be any long drawnout agony of vietnam so i reject the 
parallel but i can understand why people say that because theyre 
thinking we dont want to have a drawnout vietnam 
the president spoke only hours after the chairman of the house 
armed services committee rep les aspin dwis said bush has 
been inept in explaining his persian gulf policy to the american 
people and must build a consensus for possible us military 
action 
recent congressional criticism of bushs decision last week to 
deploy an additional 200000 us troops to the gulf region to 
provide offensive capabilities has called into focus the absence of 
such a consensus said aspin who supports the presidents policy 
bush said has not decided yet to use military force against 
saddam and wants to preserve all options 
and one way to have a credible option is to have enough force 
there to fulfill ones responsibilities if one has to exercise that 
option and that is what was behind my decision to move this amount 
of force he said 
he said furthermore he wanted to send a signal to saddam that 
we are deadly serious about getting iraq out of kuwait 
and that message i hope will get out loud and clear to him 
when he sees another hundred and some thousand of the best 
equipped best trained best motivated forcs in the world up 
against him bush added 
even if saddam does withdraw from kuwait and the rulers there 
are restored bush said there would have to be some international 
guarantees against saddams chemical weapons and his attempt to 
develop a nuclear capability 
i dont think the rest of the world would say this is good 
enough just what they call the status quo ante going back to 
where things were before the invasion he said without 
specifying what the guarantees should be 
asked about public opinion surveys showing that public support 
for his gulf policy was dwindling bush chalked it up in part to 
an enormous economic equation he said the country is going 
through an economic slowdown a disproportionate increase in 
the price of oil that stems from what saddam hussein has done 
and it does mean jobs he added 
reiterating that his motive is also to stand against iraqs 
agression bush said if i havent done as clear a job as i might 
on explainihng this then ive got to do better in that regard 
because i know in my heart of hearts that what we are doing is 
right 
bush who has declined to say whether he would first go to 
congress before undertaking a military strike said that he 
recognizes congress constitutional right to declare war 
and i have the right as commander in chief to fulfill my 
responsibilities and im going to safeguard those executive powers 
and they have every right in the world to safeguard the powers of 
the congress he said 
president bush has proven to be an inept communicator and has 
failed to convey to the public why we are in saudi arabia aspin 
said 
aspin said the president seemed on wednesday to have allayed 
lawmakers concerns that he had decided to attack iraqi forces 
now aspin said somehow weve got to in congress and in the 
country come to the consensus with how were going to deal with the 
iraqi invasion of kuwait and that will require better 
communication from bush he indicated 
in other gulfrelated developments 
iraqi president saddam hussein interviewed by abc news said 
he was holding hostages because their presence may help distract 
anybody who may opt for war 
hussein called on bush to pledge not to attack iraq and added 
an open pledge of this nature a declared statement of this 
nature would be sufficient for us to allow all foreigners to leave 
iraq 
the state department said no spokesman was available to comment 
on husseins remarks 
bush invoked emergency powers authorizing the pentagon to 
undertake military construction projects in the gulf region without 
advance approval from congress 
the house banking finance and urban affairs committee 
announced that it will hold hearings on the economic impact of us 
involvement in the middle east on nov 27 and nov 28 
aspin made his comments at a capitol hill news conference in 
which he released an interim report card on the contributions us 
allies and other nations have made toward the gulf effort 
the american people wont stand for our allies sitting out the 
fighting while americans are dying aspin said his committee 
will hold gulf hearings sometime after the thanksgiving holiday he 
said 
aspin gave turkey aplus for its prompt response in shutting 
down the oil pipeline from iraq that runs through turkey to the 
mediterranean sea and for providing base facilities for us 
military units 
egypt also received an aplus for its troop contributions 
aspin gave a grade of b to saudi arabia complaining that 
based on the amount of money the country has realized since the 
crisis now 150 million a day from increased oil prices 
some other grades 
japan c for its financial contribution the soviet union 
b kuwait a syria bplus yemen libya and sudan

the pentagon said tuesday the gulf states have contributed 6

a year after soldiers killed 
six jesuit priests in a massacre that received world attention the 
trial of those accused in the slayings has yet to start 
the soldiers who pulled the triggers have confessed and are 
likely to go to jail but the senior officer charged in the deaths 
may well go free and the question of whether higherups were 
involved is likely to remain a mystery 
state department spokesman richard boucher said thursday in 
washington 
this brutal crime shocked the conscience of el salvador and 
the world the united states insists on a full investigation 
and prosecution there is no issue regarding el salvador to which 
the ambassador and our embassy have devoted greater effort than the 
pursuit of justice in the murder of the jesuits 
the killings have cost el salvador half of its 85 million in 
american military aid planned for 1991 and called into question a 
long tradition of substantial military impunity in human rights 
cases so far no officer has ever been convicted of killing 
civilians though a few enlisted men have been 
those priests are causing us more problems dead than they did 
alive an army colonel said commenting privately he is one of 
more than a dozen highranking officers who testified before judge 
ricardo zamora the magistrate investigating the slayings and their 
aftermath 
the jesuits also professors at the jesuitrun central america 
university were killed five days after leftist rebels launched the 
biggest offensive of their decadeold war against a succession of 
usbacked governments 
the radical right and much of the military considered the 
priests leftists for arguing that misery injustice and repression 
were the causes of the civil war conservative forces saw the war 
as part of communist expansion 
the killings took place before dawn last nov 16 about 40 
soldiers from the elite atlacatl infantry battalion tramped across 
the campus pounded on the door and smashed windows of the jesuits 
dormitorylike residence 
according to statements by the soldiers they roused the 
educators and marched five of them to the yard behind the building 
the soldiers forced the five including university rector ignacio 
ellacuria to lie face down 
the soldiers said in their statements that lt jose espinoza 
walked over to pvt antonio avalos who along with pvt oscar 
amaya stood guard over the prostrate men 
when are you going to proceed espinoza asked avalos 
avalos said he took that as the signal to commence so he and 
amaya fatally shot the priests in the head with their assault 
rifles 
the sixth priest father joaquin lopez had been wounded in his 
bedroom he was finished off with four bullets when he grabbed the 
foot of a soldier walking past him 
elba ramos the jesuits housekeeper and her 15yearold 
daughter celina were murdered as they hugged each other on the 
floor of a small bedroom espinoza said he was ordered by a colonel 
who sent him to eliminate witnesses 
eight military men including col guillermo benavides are 
under arrest and charged with the priests murder another soldier 
is a fugitive 
benavides did not take part in the killings but is accused of 
ordering them 
father jose maria tojeira the jesuit provincial for central 
america says the order maintains a hypothesis of guilt going 
beyond benavides he said the jesuits suspect a group of colonels 
pressured benavides to order the slayings 
during 10 years of civil war salvadorans have suffered a wide 
variety of right and leftwing violence archbishop oscar arnulfo 
romero was gunned down by suspected rightwing triggermen as he 
said mass security forces raped and murdered three us nuns and 
their layworker companion soldiers and civilian death squads have 
slain many common folk unknown beyond their hamlets and marxist 
rebels have carried out their own killings 
last month the us congress which has bankrolled a succession 
of salvadoran governments halved military aid for fiscal 1991 it 
said the remaining aid would be cut if those responsible for the 
jesuit murders were not punished 
representative joe moakley dmass heads a us congressional 
delegation monitoring the investigation in august he said 
salvadoran military officers have withheld evidence destroyed 
evidence falsified evidence and repeatedly perjured themselves in 
testimony before the judge 
judicial sources say those who committed the murders likely will 
get the maximum 30 years in prison 
the only hard evidence incriminating benavides is the testimony 
of two lieutenants among those charged with the murders but under 
salvadoran law testimony from a defendant is inadmissable as 
evidence against a codefendent 
one judicial source said that if the case were to go to trial 
tomorrow and if the law were respected benavides would be 
acquitted 
but the salvadoran judiciary is subject to political pressure 
the slain priests colleagues predict benavides will be convicted 
simply because it is politically impossible to let him off 
the armed forces need a scapegoat said father rogelio 
pedraz who runs the campus publishing house and who was not at the 
residence the night of the massacre he had left to pick up some 
laundry 
until recently judge zamora had hoped to start the trial this 
year then a wrench landed in the works 
moakley on oct 18 revealed that us army maj eric buckland 
the adviser to the salvadoran military who originally incriminated 
benavides told fbi investigators in january that members of the 
salvadoran high command knew at least 10 days before the priests 
were slain that benavides intended to harm them 
col rene emilio ponce then chief of the joint chiefs of staff 
and now the defense minister allegedly sent an envoy accompanied 
by buckland to calm down benavides regarding the jesuits 
the affidavit containing that information which buckland later 
recanted and which ponce rejects as a lie was not made available 
to moakley or zamora until october 
zamora is planning to recall for further pretrial testimony 
some of those named by the us major

through an economic slowdown a disproportionate increase in 
the price of oil that stems from what saddam hussein has done 
and it does mean jobs he added 
reiterating that his motive is also to stand against iraqs 
agression bush said if i havent done as clear a job as i might 
on explainihng this then ive got to do better in that regard 
because i know in my heart of hearts that what we are doing is 
right 
bush who has declined to say whether he would first go to 
congress before undertaking a military strike said that he 
recognizes congress constitutional right to declare war 
and i have the right as commander in chief to fulfill my 
responsibilities and im going to safeguard those executive powers 
and they have every right in the world to safeguard the powers of 
the congress he said 
president bush has proven to be an inept communicator and has 
failed to convey to the public why we are in saudi arabia aspin 
said 
aspin said the president seemed on wednesday to have allayed 
lawmakers concerns that he had decided to attack iraqi forces 
now aspin said somehow weve got to in congress and in the 
country come to the consensus with how were going to deal with the 
iraqi invasion of kuwait and that will require better 
communication from bush he indicated 
in other gulfrelated developments 
iraqi president saddam hussein interviewed by abc news said 
he was holding hostages because their presence may help distract 
anybody who may opt for war 
hussein called on bush to pledge not to attack iraq and added 
an open pledge of this nature a declared statement of this 
nature would be sufficient for us to allow all foreigners to leave 
iraq 
the state department said no spokesman was available to comment 
on husseins remarks 
bush invoked emergency powers authorizing the pentagon to 
undertake military construction projects in the gulf region without 
advance approval from congress 
the house banking finance and urban affairs committee 
announced that it will hold hearings on the economic impact of us 
involvement in the middle east on nov 27 and nov 28 
aspin made his comments at a capitol hill news conference in 
which he released an interim report card on the contributions us 
allies and other nations have made toward the gulf effort 
the american people wont stand for our allies sitting out the 
fighting while americans are dying aspin said his committee 
will hold gulf hearings sometime after the thanksgiving holiday he 
said 
aspin gave turkey aplus for its prompt response in shutting 
down the oil pipeline from iraq that runs through turkey to the 
mediterranean sea and for providing base facilities for us 
military units 
egypt also received an aplus for its troop contributions 
aspin gave a grade of b to saudi arabia complaining that 
based on the amount of money the country has realized since the 
crisis now 150 million a day from increased oil prices

trip to the middle east and europe becoming the first us 
president to visit frontline troops since lyndon johnson in 
vietnam before his thanksgiving stop in saudi arabia hell sign a 
historic eastwest arms control agreement in paris 
the persian gulf crisis will dominate the tour even while the 
president is in paris attending a 34nation european summit 
aides said bush would seek to coordinate his gulf policies when 
he meets with leaders of the soviet union britain and france at 
the threeday paris gathering 
in particular us officials said bush plans to sound out 
these and other members of the 15member un security council on 
wording of a proposed resolution to authorize force to drive iraq 
from kuwait 
although the european summit is largely a celebration of the end 
of the cold war bush is more than a onetopic president said 
a senior administration official 
he understands the significance of what is going to go on in 
paris by the same token i am sure he will use opportunities as 
they come along to discuss the gulf with others who are 
attending said the official briefing reporters at the white 
house on condition of anonymity 
secretary of state james a baker iii flew to europe ahead of 
bush on thursday to help lay groundwork on gulf policy he was 
meeting with foreign ministers of security council members 
including three african countries ethiopia zaire and the ivory 
coast 
before leaving washington baker said that while economic 
sanctions against iraqs saddam hussein seem to be working the 
real question is are they working to achieve the goal of 
saddams unconditional withdrawal from kuwait 
baker and bush will link up again on monday in paris at the 
beginning of the european summit 
the centerpiece of the paris session is a treaty sharply 
reducing nonnuclear forces that both nato and the warsaw pact 
maintain in central and eastern europe 
it is the first major eastwest agreement on conventional arms 
since the end of world war ii 
in his session with gorbachev early next week bush is likely to 
discuss the condition of the troubled soviet economy the 
administration is developing contingency plans to provide emergency 
food and medicine to the soviet union to help it get through the 
winter officials said 
the planning is based more on concern that disorders may 
escalate than on food shortages although they are severe said the 
officials who spoke on the condition of anonymity 
bush was to leave washington friday evening for the trip which 
will begin with a oneday state visit to prague czechoslovakia on 
the first anniversary of the velvet revolution that ended years 
of communist control

foley dwash house minority leader robert michel rill senate 
majority leader george mitchell dmaine and senate minority 
leader bob dole rkan would make the trip 
the white house will not discuss specific sites for security 
reasons but bush is expected to visit forces both on a naval 
vessel and in desert encampments in saudi arabia 
it will mark the first visit of a us president to frontline 
troops since president johnson visited forces during a halfday 
visit to vietnam in 1967 
bush will wind up the eightday trip with a stop in cairo

atlantis lit up the sky in a rare 
launch in darkness thursday as it streaked into orbit on a secret 
military mission that reportedly will send a satellite to spy on 
iraq 
the shuttle thundered from its oceanside launch pad at 648 pm 
est trailed by a 700footpillar of flame on board were five 
astronauts who will deploy the satellite during the flight 
mission controls jeff carr described the launch as picture 
perfect absolutely no anomalies to report he said the mission 
commander described the liftoff as spectacular 
this was really just about as smooth a count and liftoff and 
early few minutes of a mission as ive ever seen said nasa 
administrator richard truly 
the 100ton spaceship was visible for miles as it rocketed into 
the nighttime sky 
it was the fifth afterdark launch in 37 shuttle flights it 
also was nasas fifth launch for 1990 and the seventh and probably 
last pentagon mission to be shrouded in secrecy 
two minutes into the flight atlantis two solid fuel rockets 
burned out and dropped into the atlantic ocean the shuttle reached 
an undisclosed orbit 6 minutes later on the thrust of its three 
main liquid fuel engines and all public communications with the 
craft were cut off 
throughout the day high crosswinds and low clouds threatened to 
delay the launch but the weather improved the countdown also was 
unaffected by a lastminute problem with a unit at the launch pad 
used to cool the shuttle 
a news blackout has been imposed on atlantis fourday flight 
during which the astronauts will deploy a satellite that sources 
said is to spy on iraq experts believe it is either a photographic 
imaging or an eavesdropping spacecraft 
atlantis carried a spy satellite into orbit during its last 
flight in march 
the shuttles allmilitary crew commanded by air force col 
richard covey has been waiting for months to fly this mission the 
flight was scheduled for july but was delayed indefinitely when 
atlantis was found during a fueling test in june to have dangerous 
hydrogen leaks 
it was the second shuttle to be crippled by leaking hydrogen 
columbias astronomy mission was scrubbed in may when the spaceship 
sprang leaks during fueling 
we finally got there fixed the leaks which is again a 
testimony to the team said launch director bob sieck we do 
find problems they do occur but we fix them and well get on 
with what were supposed to do which is flying these machines 
safely and successfully 
during the grounding the national aeronautics and space 
administration replaced atlantis external fuel tank plumbing 
between the orbiter and tank and valve seals in addition 
atlantis military cargo reportedly was modified for gathering 
information in the persian gulf 
atlantis like columbia was cleared for flight during a fueling 
test last month 
nasa set a nov 9 launch date for atlantis but the air force 
delayed that mission because of undisclosed cargo problems that 
trouble quickly was resolved clearing the way for thursdays 
liftoff attempt 
also on the crew are navy cmdr frank culbertson jr pilot and 
army capt charles gemar air force lt col carl meade and marine 
col robert springer all mission specialists 
the pentagon has imposed a news blackout on the flight similar 
to its six previous missions because of the expense in maintaining 
secure operations officials said this would be the last military 
shuttle mission to be conducted in secrecy 
the pentagon plans to use the shuttle two more times in 1991 
but the cargoes in each instance will be unclassified military 
officials will rely on unmanned rockets primarily the giant titan 
4 to carry other payloads into orbit 
so far the air force has sent up three titan 4 rockets the 
most powerful unmanned launcher in the united states the third one 
blasted off monday night from cape canaveral 
air force col frank stirling who heads the titan 4 program 
said a fleet of unmanned rockets will offer greater reliability 
than nasas shuttle 
we had in a sense committed all our resources for space access 
to one program the space shuttle with only four orbiters 
stirling said 
with titan we have a continuing production line with many 
titans available so that if we should ever have a problem or an 
outage with the vehicle we would still be able to recover and 
continue operations he said

the navy has agreed that the portsmouth 
naval shipyard must observe maine environmental laws and that fines 
and fees for past violations will total more than 1 million state 
officials said thursday 
still pending was whether the state has the authority to collect 
the money from the federal government 
the agreement is part of a consent decree that settles nearly 
all of the issues in the states lawsuit against the navy stemming 
from violations of maines hazardouswaste laws at the shipyard in 
kittery maines southernmost town 
while the two sides agree on the fine total the navy still 
reserves the right to have the 1st us circuit court of appeals 
decide whether it actually has to pay maine assistant attorney 
general dennis j harnish said 
certainly the decision at the 1st circuit will have a 
substantial impact and this consent decree sets the stage for 
that harnish said 
at stake would be civil penalties of 887200 and total 
hazardous waste generator and licensing fees of 267886 for a 
total of nearly 116 million 
officials at the portsmouth atomic submarinerepair facilitys 
public affairs office did not return telephone messages left 
thursday 
maine filed two lawsuits in 1986 asking that the shipyard be 
required to clean up inactive solid waste and hazardous waste 
dumps including a landfill and a mercury disposal area 
the state in the suit that originated in york county superior 
court claimed that the navy dumped hazardous wastes into a 
treatment plant that could not handle them gave wastes to 
unlicensed handlers illegally accepted wastes from other 
installations and expanded its waste storage yard without the 
states approval 
the state also charged that the shipyard was responsible for 14 
oil spills and that it had not paid fees to the state for 
generating hazardous wastes 
in november 1988 us district judge gene carter rejected the 
navys argument that the federal government had not waived its 
immunity allowing the state to impose its fines and fees 
the navy is appealing that ruling to the 1st circuit court said 
harnish

a group of us industries formally asked the 
government thursday to penalize thailand for tolerating piracy of 
american movies music books computer software and trademarks 
an unfair trade complaint was filed with the office of the us 
trade representative that could bring formal hearings and lead to 
new penalties against thai exports to the united states 
the action was brought jointly by the recording industry 
association of america the motion picture export association of 
america and the international intellectual property alliance 
representing more than 1600 companies that produce and distribute 
motion pictures computers and software television programs and 
home videocassettes music tapes records and discs books and 
professional journals 
the industries said the thai government ignored an october 
warning that the complaint would be filed unless the thai 
government met their demand for measures against unhindered 
piracy which they say will cost them 70 million to 100 million 
this year 
thai embassy commercial counselor wisitsee chintana said the 
october warning had been sent immediately to bangkok and the 
government was doing its best to solve the problem including 
drafting legislation for submission to parliament she said she 
could not comment further without knowing more about the complaint 
after thai prime minister chattichai choonhavans white house 
visit in june there was some hope for a crackdwn against known 
thai manufacturers turning out tens of thousands of pirated music 
audiocassettes daily said jay berman president of the recording 
industry association of america 
but obviously the thai government does not consider the issue 
of sufficient importance to take action he added 
jack valenti president of the motion pictur export association 
called thailand the worst offender of intellectual property 
rights in asia 
we regret the need to go to these lengths to get thailand 
simply to enforce its existing copyright law he added the 
thai government must be made to realize that we now have no 
alternative but to ask our government to close the us market to 
important thai exports like jewelry textile products or blank 
videotape if immediate action is not taken to stem the more than 
130 million in losses our members have suffered over the last 10 
years 
according to valenti illegal copies of american movies are on 
sale throughout thailand within days of their release in the united 
states and well before their legitimate release in thailand 
american movies are increasingly screened without license by 
illegal thai cable tv systems outside of bangkok 
in 1989 the us government put thailand on a priority watch 
list because of the issue and withheld duty concessions on 165 
million worth of thai exports to the united states no further 
action was taken however and thailand enjoyed a 14 billion 
trade surplus with america for the year

convicted murderer lawrencia 
bambi bembenek and her fiance dominic gugilatto have asked 
permission to marry canadian jail authorities said 
the milwaukee couple remained in jail thursday following their 
arrest last month in this canadian tourist city they had lived and 
worked here after ms bembeneks escape from a wisconsin prison 
thunder bay jail superintendent john mackenzie will make a 
decision on the marriage request friday morning hours before 
gugliatto is scheduled to be deported to the united states deputy 
jail superintendent michael coons said 
if their request is approved ms bembenek and gugliatto will be 
married in a large office at the maximum security jail coons said 
gugliatto 35 faces charges in wisconsin of allegedly aiding 
and abetting ms bembeneks escape in fond du lac in southeastern 
wisconsin the deportation was ordered after canadian immigration 
authorities determined that gugliatto had worked in the country 
without authorization 
a hearing to determine whether ms bembenek will be deported was 
set for nov 22 
ms bembenek a former model milwaukee police officer and 
playboy club waitress created a media sensation when she escaped 
from the taycheedah correctional institution on july 15 canadian 
police captured her and gugliatto on oct 17 
ms bembenek 32 was serving a life sentence for the 1981 
murder of her former husbands exwife 
coons said the couple made the request to get married while in 
custody earlier this month 
a husbandwife privilege that prevents spouses from being 
compelled to testify against each other probably would not apply in 
the case of gugliatto and ms bembenek because all the alleged 
crimes occurred before marriage said fond du lac county sheriffs

the centers for disease control said thursday the 
risk of getting aids from contact with medical waste is relatively 
small but it recommended hospitals try to reduce the amount of 
waste generated 
the waste report was based on a study presented to congress 
earlier this fall by the agency for toxic substances and disease 
registry like the cdc an arm of the department of health and human 
services 
the report which measured the health impact of medical waste 
estimated that a maximum of four aids cases a year occur among 
health care workers who suffer injuries from needles or other sharp 
objects in waste from hospitals and doctors offices 
that would represent 01 percent of the 35238 us aids cases 
reported to the cdc in 1989 
the study also estimated that as many as 160 hepatitis b cases a 
year about 1 percent of the total may occur because of contact 
with medical waste 
the cdc said the risk of these diseases from medical waste is 
particularly small for the general public which usually is not in 
contact with these materials federal health officials in the past 
have urged health care workers to take precautions such as wearing 
protective clothing when dealing with medical waste 
though the report downplayed the health risk it and the cdc 
stressed the need for better management of medical waste which 
comprises about 3 percent of the 158 million tons of municipal 
solid waste created each year in the united states 
the most effective way of reducing medical waste is to reduce 
the amount of waste created on a small scale in homes and on a 
large scale in health care operations the cdc report said 
the cdc urged more emphasis on recycling reuse and reclamation 
of medical waste

helicopters made repeated water drops 
thursday on a 34000acre wildfire nea the missouri river in 
rugged mountain timber considered too dangerous for fire crews to 
operate on the ground 
its not a safe situation to try to put people in so were 
going to try to drown that stuff out said bob krepps of the us 
forest service 
the aerial assault concentrated on the southern flank of the 
fire near the boundary between the gates of the mountains 
wilderness and adjacent beartooth game range in the western montana 
rockies 
it was a cool windy day in western montana with temperatures 
near 40 and gusts up to 30 mph 
stiff westerly winds fanned flames on the fires eastern flank 
as well and crews were sent in to battle flareups said dave 
turner a fire information officer at the interagency dispatch 
center near helena 
thats the most remote the furthest area of fire away from 
the fire camp and fire managers were considering setting up an 
auxiliary or spike camp to put firefighters closer to the 
action turner said 
officials expressed satisfaction thursday at progress toward 
containing the unusual lateseason blaze 
turner said it was 20 percent contained by thursday afternoon 
krepps said that about 10 percent to 15 percent of the total fire 
area still was burning actively while the fire had burned itself 
out on most of the rest of the 34000 acres 
were down to the dirty stuff now of making sure things are 
secure krepps said in a telephone interview from the fire 
command post near wolf creek were hitting the hotter areas 
today then its going to be cleanup for the next couple of days 
about 400 firefighters were called in to combat the blaze which 
broke out tuesday in the rugged big belt mountains about 35 miles 
northeast of helena authorities said it appeared to have started 
accidentally at a hunting camp 
at least 30 rural homes were evacuated and about two dozen 
hunters fled the area tuesday night many on horseback one group 
of hunters survived the flames by jumping into a mountain creek 
firefighters have been hampered by limited daylight and 
nighttime temperatures that dipped below freezing but those same 
temperatures helped to limit the spread of the fire turner said 
what continues to be the problem are the dry conditions he 
said 
elsewhere firefighters were sent home thursday after containing 
a 33000acre grass and timber fire on the fort belknap indian 
reservation about 190 miles northeast of the missouri river fire

the nations roman catholic bishops were told 
on thursday that their long sidetracked struggle to delineate 
church rights of women still is alive and well 
after seven years the work continues said bishop joseph l 
imesch of joliet ill head of a committee striving to shape a 
pastoral letter on women that would be fair to them 
past drafts of the proposed teaching letter have been widely 
criticized as contradictory in asserting equal standing of women 
yet reiterating that they remain ineligible for the most 
influential role the priesthood 
in a discussion of the difficulties with the letter at the 
annual meeting of the national conference of catholic bishops 
auxiliary bishop francis p murphy of baltimore said 
this is a very unhappy time but he commended the continued 
grappling with the issue 
it has raised the consciousness of the church in this country 
and thrown light on the equal or unequal experience of women in the 
church and society he said 
action on the letter initially had been scheduled at this weeks 
meeting of the bishops but this was postponed in september by an 
administrative committee 
in a closing session of their fourday meeting the bishops 
also 
approved principles for more gender neutral language in a new 
lectionary the cycle of bible readings for worship service 
terms such as brethren would be rendered brothers and 
sisters and man as people also blanket pejorative 
references to the jews become the jewish authorities or 
leaders 
modified a planned pastoral letter on the 1992 observance of 
the coming of columbus and europeans to america to recognize 
abuses inflicted on american indians and blacks 
as for the pastoral letter on women imesch said i want to 
erase any doubt about the future of the project he said 
suggested changes were continuing to be received and would be 
considered 
asked afterward if there was any discomfort among the bishops 
one of the countrys last exclusively male organizations in trying 
to define the place of women he said 
theres a great deal of uncomfortability 
he added that there has been much input from women in hearings 
across the country but he said it would be a miracle if the 
drafters were able to overcome the hurdle of reconciling the 
principle of womens equality with church rules barring their 
ordination 
but miracles can happen he added 
dropping of the letter from the bishops current agenda came 
after the vatican suggested prior consultation with bishops 
conferences in other countries before taking action 
imesch told reporters some suggestions about the letter from 
rome might or might not be accepted adding we may not accept 
all those locally or from rome 
pope john paul ii at one point ordered no more discussion of the 
idea of womens ordination

stripping manuel noriega of his fortune and forcing 
him to accept courtappointed lawyers would be unfair and make the 
us judicial system look bad some of the nations top legal 
scholars say 
us district judge william hoeveler has set a friday deadline 
for noriegas private attorneys to work out payment and resume 
working on the drugsmuggling case otherwise the judge will 
appoint governmentpaid counsel for the deposed panamanian 
dictator 
the criminal justice act which governs such appointments 
allows for only two or three relatively lowpaid lawyers and a few 
thousand dollars for investigating the case 
noriegas current lawyers object saying the government reneged 
on president bushs pledge to give noriega a fair trial some legal 
experts agree 
its made it an unfair and unbalanced prosecution said 
harvard university law professor alan dershowitz its extremely 
unfair to take a case where the united states has put incredible 
resources and ask someone to defend it on the basis of the cja 
budget 
cable news network asked supreme court justice anthony m 
kennedy on thursday to let it broadcast tape recordings of 
noriegas telephone conversations with his lawyers 
network lawyers asked kennedy to set aside a federal judges 
order banning such broadcasts kennedy referred the matter to the 
full court and ordered lawyers for noriega and the bush 
administration to file responses by noon saturday 
the fbi meanwhile said it had obtained cnn tapes taken from an 
atlanta hotel lostandfound to see if they include portions of the 
material involved in the court battle the network protested that 
the tapes were obtained without a warrant 
the defense estimates that the justice department is using 25 to 
30 lawyers and will spend up to 30 million to prosecute noriega 
university of michigan law professor yale kamisar said the 
cases investigative phase is often more important than the trial 
in a complicated prosecution like noriegas and thats precisely 
where courtappointed lawyers are at a disadvantage 
neal sonnett who recently ended a term as president of the 
national association of criminal defense lawyers said the laws 
allowable budget makes the case a mismatch 
he noted that the case already has shown it is forging new law 
in many areas the us invasion of panama noriegas status as a 
prisoner of war and a head of state the frozen accounts and the 
battle over cable news networks broadcast of taped telephone 
calls 
in a case of this magnitude with all the issues at stake the 
united states should be bending over backward to ensure noriega has 
the lawyers of his choice said sonnett who once worked on the 
noriega case 
william greenhalgh a georgetown university law professor said 
the cases prestige may allow the judge to find toplevel lawyers 
prepared to take the case even at a fraction of their normal 
rates 
but he agreed that the investigative resources are inadequate 
and worried that hoeveler is insisting on a trial by jan 28 or 
shortly thereafter 
i think it would be most unfortunate if the judge pushes 
whoever he appoints to go to trial before theyre ready 
greenhalgh said if i got appointed to it i would be filing a 
huge motion for continuance 
another issue disturbing the experts is that noriegas pauper 
status was created by the government soon after the invasion of 
panama the justice department asked foreign nations to freeze 27 
bank accounts holding about 20 million in money allegedly 
controlled by noriega 
hoeveler ordered that money freed in june but prosecutors 
responded that the foreign governments stepped in with their own 
confiscation procedures tying up the money indefinitely 
justice department spokesmen refused to comment about 
courtappointment law because of its application to the case 
one of the few organizations favoring the laws use in noriegas 
case is the conservative washington legal foundation 
the sixth amendment entitles him to adequate counsel said 
the foundations chief counsel richard samp it doesnt entitle 
him to the best counsel he can get in the country 
but even samp said he has doubts about freezing noriegas assets 
in the first place 
i have qualms about any pretrial procedures in which the 
government takes away peoples assets he said noriega ought 
to have a chance to contest that 
one lawyer who knows the resources the government will use is 
jose quinon who unsuccessfully defended colombian drug lord carlos 
lehder rivas now serving a life sentence 
quinon immediate past president of the florida association of 
criminal defense lawyers estimates noriegas lawyers would need 
750000 for investigations alone but will be lucky to get 5000 
or 10000 under the court appointment law 
theyll convict him not because of the evidence but because 
the defense had inadequate resources said quinon 
most of the experts agreed that using courtappointed lawyers in 
the highprofile case will look bad in the glare of international 
publicity 
this is the kind of case we should be showing the world how 
fair we are and what kind of criminal justice system we have 
quinon said but this whole thing is now an embarrassment not 
only for the government but the courts and society as a whole

key national leaders on thursday rejected a proposed emergency 
arab summit to resolve the persian gulf crisis despite iraqi 
protests us and saudi forces launched imminent thunder a 
sixday amphibious exercise near kuwait 
president bush who leaves for europe and the gulf friday said 
he ordered the big buildup in us military power in the area 
instead of waiting out iraq because it is hard to keep public 
support for a longterm struggle 
bush was replying to a query in an interview with cable news 
network on why he chose to develop a major offensive capability for 
possible war instead of planning a long stay in saudi arabia while 
economic sanctions cripple iraq 
two more americans arrived in amman jordan on a regularly 
scheduled flight from baghdad a us embassy spokesman said the 
two were us diplomats but it was unclear whether they had worked 
in kuwait or iraq 
the americans arrived along with 24 other foreigners 22 irish 
citizens one dutch national and one briton they all were medical 
personnel from a foreignrun hospital in baghdad 
saddam hussein said in an interview with abctv he would release 
the foreign hostages he is holding as human shields in iraq and 
occupied kuwait only if bush promises not to attack his country 
such an open pledge of this nature a declared statement of 
this nature would be sufficient for us to allow all foreigners to 
leave iraq the iraqi president said 
iraq says it is holding hundreds of foreigners at strategic 
locations such as military installations to protect against attack 
saddam interviewed in a government guest house in baghdad the 
iraqi capital said he regrets holding the hostages 
this is the only decision which we have taken which rather 
chokes us up he said 
however he again asserted that the hostages were his best 
protection against attack 
the only justification for this situtation is that the 
presence of these people may help distract anybody who may opt for 
war it may make them hesitate a little before jumping into a 
decision of this nature he said 
as for dialogue with the united states saddam said he was 
unwilling to meet bushs demand that iraq unconditionally withdraw 
from kuwait 
this is not dialogue these are preconditions imposed to 
insure our capitulation he said we reject such 
preconditions 
the official iraqi news agency announced thursday that bush 
would go on trial in absentia next month in algeria for 
inhuman policies and planning aggression against the people of 
iraq 
the trial will begin dec 10 in algiers ina said in what it 
called an international court of justice 
it said the verdict would be relayed to un secretarygeneral 
javier perez de cuellar and international groups concerned with 
human rights 
iraq first spoke of putting bush on trial in september after 
western leaders said saddam should be tried for war crimes 
presidents hafez assad of syria and hosni mubarak of egypt 
became the latest arab leaders to reject the emergency arab summit 
which was billed by the king of morocco as perhaps the last 
chance for peace 
saudi arabia said wednesday it would not participate in the 
meeting unless baghdad promised beforehand to leave kuwait which 
it invaded aug 2 iraq made it clear that no such promise was 
forthcoming 
in a joint statement released in damascus assad and mubarak 
said they also rejected the idea because of iraqs intransigence 
and in jiddah saudi arabia kuwaits governmentinexile also 
objected citing iraqs refusal to withdraw 
the objections effectively killed chances for the summit a few 
arab league members including sudan and the palestine liberation 
organization had agreed to moroccos proposal 
both syria and egypt have contributed troops to the 
300000strong usled multinational force confronting iraq 
the appeal on sunday by king hassan ii of morocco for arab 
leaders to gather provoked a flurry of diplomatic activity among 
those trying to promote the summit was the soviet union which sent 
highlevel envoys to the middle east this week to discuss the idea 
while the exact location of imminent thunder which began 
thursday was not revealed and a news blackout was imposed for the 
initial phases of the operation a pentagon spoesman said in 
washington the exercise was based in eastern saudi arabia about 
100 miles from kuwait 
the operation involves 1000 us marines 1100 aircraft and 16 
ships iraq has termed it a provocative act because it is being 
held close to occupied kuwait 
there have been three previous amphibious exercises in the 
persian gulf but they were believed to have been held farther 
south on wednesday the washington times reported imminent thunder 
would be held 10 miles from kuwait no live ammunition will be 
fired in the operation us officials say but it will involve the 
largest use of aircraft in a single training exercise since us 
forces were deployed in the region in august 
imminent thunder is not intended to provoke the iraqis said 
us navy spokesman cmdr jd van sickle 
the purpose is to give participating forces training in joint 
and combined operations and to enhance amphibious warfare skills 
he said 
military officials said there was no particular significance to 
the name of the operation and that its timing was not linked to any 
operational plans 
the united states has doubled the number of aircraft carriers in 
the gulf region to six and ordered in about 200000 additional 
military personnel to join the estimated 230000 already deployed 
the multinational force arrayed against iraq numbers more than 
300000 
in other developments secretary of state james a baker iii 
headed thursday to brussels on his way to yet another round of 
consultations with foreign leaders 
baker was to meet friday with the 12nation european community 
which is providing aid to countries that have been hit hard by the 
trade embargo against iraq 
over the weekend he was to meet with the foreign ministers of 
three african countries as well as romania and finland 
elsewhere on the diplomatic front iranian foreign minister ali 
akbar velayati was in iraq on thursday meeting with saddam and 
visiting moslem shrines 
velayati the highestranking iranian to visit iraq since the 
1979 islamic revolution in iran said he had made it clear to 
saddam and other senior officials that tehran wanted iraq to 
withdraw from kuwait 
the two countries fought each other for nearly a decade during 
the 198088 iraniraq war

the national council of churches voted 
friday to urge the united states to halt its military buildup in 
the persian gulf and begin withdrawing troops from the region 
the only us troops that should stay are those which might be 
required and explicitly recommended by the security council of the 
united nations the church council said in a policy statement 
approved at its convention 
we stand at a unique moment in human history when all around 
us seemingly impregnable walls are being broken down and deep 
historical enmities are being healed the council said and 
yet ironically at such a moment our own nation seems to be poised 
at the brink of war in the middle east 
the council said president bush and congress should use every 
means to try to reach a peaceful settlement in the persian gulf 
including direct negotiations with iraq 
the council also expressed support for the holding of a un 
international conference aimed at reaching a comprehensive peace in 
the middle east 
and it reiterated its opposition to the withholding of food and 
medicine from iraq but added that it generally supports the un 
sanctions against iraq 
the council urged iraq to release immediately all foreigners 
held against their will in kuwait or iraq and called on iraq to 
immediately withraw its troops from kuwait 
the vote came after the head of a group of christian churches in 
the middle east urged the council to launch a united effort to seek 
peace in the middle east 
many people forget that christianity came from the middle 
east said gabriel habib general secretary of the middle east 
council of churches how can we say to other people love each 
other live in peace if we dont have peace where christianity 
began 
the middle east council is a sister group of the national 
council which represents more than 42 million members of 
protestant and eastern orthodox denominations in the united states 
habib also urged president bush to talk directly to iraqi leader 
saddam hussein bush risks taking the blame for any war if he 
appears unwilling to exhaust all peaceful ways to remove iraqi 
troops from kuwait habib said 
the best route to a settlement he said lies with the united 
nations because it involves a cooperative effort among all nations 
in other business the national council nominated a new york 
city minister to become the first woman to lead the council since 
it was founded 40 years ago 
the rev joan brown campbell 58 was chosen by a 29member 
search committee to become general secretary she was formally 
nominated for the post wednesday an election was expected to 
approve the nomination thursday or friday

tough 
in new york workers at the daily news have been on strike since

spread to include about 2100 employees the news has continued to 
publish since the violenceplagued strike began using replacement 
workers newspaper guild members who crossed picket lines and

gov jim florio said thursday he will 
cut 8 percent from the new jersey budget this year instead of 
waiting a year 
the governor said results of the nov 6 election in new jersey 
showed him he needs to demonstrate state government will cut back 
immediately if a 28 billion tax increase is to prove palatable 
florios fellow democrats performed poorly or lost on election 
day which analysts saw as a voter protest to the tax hike 
the 8 percent cut will affect all 19 state departments and could 
include layoffs florio said he would not speculate on how many 
layoffs could occur among the 87000 state employees or which 
departments if any might be eliminated 
we need to accelerate that cutting process if were going to 
respond to the peoples challenge florio said we need to 
start saving money right now and not just be talking about it 
florio asked officials gathered for a luncheon of the new jersey 
league of municipalities to keep local spending down in conjunction 
with the states effort to cut costs 
florio suggested regionalization the combining of services 
provided by separate localities as one way of cutting expenses and 
thus reducing property tax increases 
property taxes soared by 108 percent during the last decade 
he said thats intolerable it destroys communities and drives 
people out of the neighborhoods they helped build

hal holbrook is a towering king lear an old 
man who slips in and out of sanity but who never forgets that he is 
king and accustomed to having every word obeyed 
one doesnt see holbrook or his portrayals of mark twain or abe 
lincoln in shakespeares king lear on the offbroadway 
roundabout stage one sees lear 
in the play which opened thursday holbrooks lear sometimes 
pulls himself back from madness through strength of will his hand 
shakes at moments of anxiety and he shouts with authority when he 
has lost power 
but when when cordelia is killed he lays her down gently 
smooths her hair and makes the audience share a parents unbearable 
pain at the death of a beloved child 
the production directed by gerald freedman doesnt have a 
static moment audience attention cant flag somebody or something 
on stage is always moving 
the evenings second most interesting performance is by margery 
murray as regan john woodson is on target as the earl of kent 
disguised as a hearty servant of king lear ron randell is the 
other unwise old father gloucester christopher mccann is a 
sharpbeaked brighteyed chicken of a person as lears fool gary 
sloan properly insolent as gonerils steward 
the words explain the duplicity of gloucesters son edmund john 
hutton but one doesnt feel the evil personality underneath when 
hes lying to his father edgar the brother edmund is trying to 
kill is called too good to suspect evil but michael jamesreed 
though he hops around effectively in edgars nearnude disguise as 
poor tom plays edgar as too much of a wimp 
gloria biegler looks right as cordelia the excellent costumes 
are by robert wojewodski but has a bit of debutante manner

saddam hussein said thursday he would release 
his foreign hostages only if president bush promises not to attack 
his country and claimed that he needs nuclear weapons to balance 
what he said were israels 
such an open pledge of this nature a declared statement of 
this nature would be sufficient for us to allow all foreigners to 
leave iraq the iraqi president said in an interview with abctv 
the iraqi government says it is holding hundreds of foreigners 
at strategic locations such as military installations to protect 
against attack hundreds also have also been released 
intermittently the past few months many at the request of 
individual envoys 
saddam interviewed in a government guest house in baghdad the 
iraqi capital said he regrets holding the hostages 
this is the only decision which we have taken which rather 
chokes us up he said not for fear of anybody but out of this 
sense of respect for humanity 
however he again asserted that the hostages were his best 
protection against attack 
the only justification for this situtation is that the 
presence of these people may help distract anybody who may opt for 
war it may make them hesitate a little before jumping into a 
decision of this nature he said 
on other topics saddam was asked why he sought nuclear weapons 
because israel is in possession of chemical biological and 
nuclear weapons and israel is following a policy of expansion at 
the expense of the arabs he replied through an interpreter 
so the way we see it is that peace sometimes dictates for a 
kind of balance to be drawn 
iraq has made several attempts to acquire equipment and 
technology useful for producing nuclear weapons in two notable 
instances us and british authorities blocked a shipment of 
fastacting electrical switches and us authorities seized 
hightemperature ovens that authorities said could have been used 
for nuclear devices 
though many analysts have concluded that israel either has or 
could quickly produce nuclear weapons israel has never admitted 
having them and has said israel will not be the first to introduce 
them into the middle east 
the arab fight against israel also formed the basis of saddams 
defenseof sheltering two men accused of many terrorist attacks 
abu nidal and abu abbas 
though the two may make mistakes he said our view of 
them is different from the way we view the same mistakes made by 
someone whose land has not been occupied these are freedom 
fighters and not highwaymen 
bush has been leading the international stand against iraqs 
aug 2 takeover of neighboring kuwait more than 300000 soldiers 
from 26 nations including 230000 from the united states have 
massed in the gulf region last week bush ordered in another 
200000 us soldiers 
asked whether he was willing to discuss the mideast crisis with 
other leaders saddam said we have been ready all along 
as for dialogue with the united states saddam said he was 
unwilling to meet bushs demand that iraq unconditionally withdraw 
from kuwait before any discussions 
this is not dialogue these are preconditions imposed to 
insure our capitulation he said we reject such 
preconditions 
asked whether his position in kuwait is negotiable he said 
when i say something i mean it he did not elaborate

nasa lost contact with magellan for 40 
minutes thursday halting the spacecrafts venusmapping mission 
for most of the day as a nagging malfunction resurfaced for the 
third time in three months 
engineers sent new commands to the spacecraft successfully 
pointing its main antenna toward earth so it could resume its 744 
million mission to make radar pictures and maps of venus said 
steve saunders magellans chief scientist at jet propulsion 
laboratory 
magellan normally loses contact with earth during part of each 
orbit of venus but shortly after 9 am pst a ground tracking 
station failed to regain magellans radio signal meaning contact 
was lost completely the national aeronautics and space 
administration said in a statement 
contact was restored 40 minutes later when engineers locked onto 
a radio signal that gives them information about the spacecrafts

the main dishshaped antenna still was pointed away from earth 
by a scant 1 degrees the antenna must be aimed precisely at earth 
so magellans pictures of venus can be transmitted to earth at a 
very high speed using a narrowbeam radio signal 
mapping was halted for most of the day until the new commands 
made magellan point its antenna properly mapping resumed thursday 
night 
magellan was launched from space shuttle atlantis on may 4 
1989 and went into orbit around venus on aug 10 nasa lost 
contact with the spacecraft for roughly 11 hours starting aug 16 
just hours after magellan made its first test pictures of venus 
communications broke down for another 17 hours beginning aug 21 
engineers repeatedly warned they might lose touch with magellan 
again but thursdays blackout was the first since magellan 
formally started its mapmaking mission sept 15 
i always get really worried about these things but i know in 
my heart we can expect this to happen and its going to happen 
again saunders said adding that the engineers deserve a lot 
of praise for restoring contact with magellan so quickly 
thursday 
engineers still havent learned the cause of the previous radio 
blackouts but a similar event probably caused thursdays loss of 
contact nasa said 
however thursdays blackout lasted only a short time because of 
improvements in magellans safety systems that were made following 
the august breakdowns nasa said 
at the time of thursdays malfunction magellan had orbited 
venus 713 times and made pictures of the planet during 338 of those 
orbits experiment representative steve wall said

a replacement greyhound bus driver 
who told passengers he hadnt killed anybody yet as the bus 
hurtled across western montana and northern idaho has pleaded 
guilty to inattentive driving 
nick f eisenbarth 29 of spokane had been scheduled to stand 
trial wednesday on a charge of reckless driving but pleaded guilty 
to the lesser offense in an arrangement with prosecutors 
eisenbarth was fined 300 and sentenced to two days in jail with 
credit for one day served 
the plea bargain was reached because all the witnesses were from 
out of state and it would have been too expensive to bring them to 
idaho for eisenbarths trial said robyn dvorak kootenai county 
deputy prosecutor 
greyhound lines fired eisenbarth after learning of the incident 
which occurred july 19 on a run from missoula mont to seattle a

tight curve along lake coeur dalene at 20 mph over the posted 
speed limit passengers said 
passengers also said the driver got the bus stuck in a driveway 
and cursed riders who complained about his driving

the united states is expected to circulate 
a security council resolution by the end of november to authorize 
collective un force to drive iraq from kuwait diplomats said 
thursday 
a senior us official traveling with secretary of state james 
a baker iii in europe said if other nations react favorably to the 
idea during a new round of consultations the bush administration 
will seek such authority from the united nations 
however yevgeny primakov the soviet unions top middle east 
envoy said later thursday the world should do everything 
possible to encourage iraq to leave kuwait including agreeing to 
hold talks on the palestinian question 
primakov speaking in new york reiterated the kremlins desire 
to avoid a military conflict in the persian gulf he said iraq 
should be given the opportunity for a facesaving withdrawal 
from kuwait 
baker is on a diplomatic trip to shore up support for such a 
use of force resolution with foreign ministers from countries 
on the security council 
white house spokesman marlin fitzwater said wednesday that no 
decision has been made on submitting a resolution 
however the official with baker saidif what we hear is 
favorable from the countries that have been contacted so far and 
then the ones that will be consulted that would be enough for us 
to make the decision to go forward 
he said the united states would like to introduce the resolution 
this month while it still presides over the security council 
the official who spoke on condition of anonymity said the 
united states was still awaiting responses from two major 
countries he declined to identify them 
we are obviously not talking about something that would 
involve a united nations command of our forces he added 
the official said the resolution would ask for authority to use 
force if peaceful measures fail 
he spoke to reporters thursday aboard bakers plane to brussels 
belgium a transcript of his remarks was made available there 
graham green first secretary at canadas un mission said of 
a resolution authorizing force you are likely to see it this 
month but probably with a reference to a time limit on letting 
sanctions work 
canadian ambassador yves fortier added you dont need a road 
map to envision an 11th resolution 
other diplomats concurred with that assessment speaking on 
condition of anonymity 
the united nations has passed 10 resolutions directed against 
iraq since president saddam husseins troops invaded tht small 
emirate aug 2 
the ideal timing would be for the united states to introduce the 
resolution just before the month ends and then press aggressively 
for its adoption when it is no longer president 
in december the ambassador of yemen the only arab member of 
the council assumes the presidency followed by zaire in january 
and zimbabwe in february 
the united states and soviet union both have drawn up proposals 
for a use of force resolution diplomats in new york and 
washington officials say 
european diplomats who have seen the soviet document say it 
would put heavy reliance on the sofar passive military staff 
committee of the security council they spoke on condition of not 
being identified 
that committees function under the un charter is to 
advise and assist on its military requirements including the 
employment and command of forces placed at its disposal 
since america has the great majority of troops in a 
multinational force now in the persian gulf it would be likely to 
dominate any command structure 
baker now is seeking consensus on when to use force green said 
the secretary meets saturday in geneva with the foreign 
ministers of ethiopia ivory coast and zaire all security council 
members 
last week he lined up the soviet union china britain and 
france permanent members of the council who could have vetoed the 
resolution 
baker flies to paris to meet sunday with the foreign ministers 
of romania and finland two more council members and meet again 
with soviet foreign minister eduard a shevardnadze and british 
foreign secretary douglas hurd 
saudi arabia egypt bahrain egypt turkey and the exiled 
government of kuwait assured baker during his recent trip to the 
gulf and europe that they would not oppose the resolution

the fbi said thursday it had obtained cnn tapes 
and was checking whether they are related to the manuel noriega 
recordings at the center of a court battle the network protested 
the tapes were obtained without a warrant 
cable news network said the tapes were in a box of materials 
related to the noriega case that was removed from a hotel room that 
had been occupied by one of its reporters the room was in the omni 
hotel which is part of a complex that houses cnns offices 
it was not immediately clear whether the tapes taken were audio 
recordings or videotapes cnn president tom johnson and cnn chief 
counsel steve korn said they didnt know the contents of the box 
fbi spokesman scott nelson confirmed that authorities obtained cnn 
tapes without a subpoena but he didnt know what kind of tapes 
they were 
we were made aware of the tapes and merely picked them up for 
analysis nelson said 
the network demanded that the materials be returned 
cnn is seeking to overturn a federal judges order blocking it 
from airing taped jailhouse conversations between the deposed 
panamanian dictator noriega and his lawyers 
turner security which provides security for the complex had 
notified fbi agents about the box of materials the network said 
the network said the fbi had no warrant and acted over the 
objections of a cnn attorney who was present when the material was 
taken by the agents korn said the attorney asked for a warrant 
and was not given an answer and certainly not given a warrant 
johnson said he personally protested the fbis action in the 
strongest terms to agency officials in washington 
the network said a turner security official called the fbi 
because agents had told him they were looking for stolen 
government property the network said the material was not 
stolen 
hotel security officers believing that cnn reporter marlene 
fernandez had vacated the hotel room removed the box monday and 
turned it over to turner security cnn spokesman steve haworth 
said 
turner security returned the box to the hotel security office on 
thursday and then brought fbi agents to the office and gave them 
the box according to haworth and hotel officials 
the box contained some papers and at least one videotape said 
omni general manager bill thompson who saw the box handed over to 
the fbi 
johnson said its in dispute whether the room was vacated by 
fernandez who normally anchors cnns spanishlanguage telecasts in 
washington but had been working on the noriega case 
haworth also said the people who needed to know did not know 
that turner security another subsidiary of cnns parent firm 
turner broadcasting systems inc had the box of materials in its 
possession 
the new york times citing a cnn source who spoke on condition 
of anonymity said the tapes taken were not the noriega tapes 
the fbi did not get the main course he said 
the tapes at the center of the court battle are recordings of 
phone conversations between noriega and his lawyers on nov 8 
us district judge william hoeveler in miami barred cnn from 
broadcasting at least some portions of the seven tapes it has until 
hoeveler can determine whether the broadcasts would endanger 
noriegas right to a fair trial by compromising privileged 
attorneyclient discussions 
cnn has refused to hand over the tapes to hoeveler on thursday 
the network asked a us supreme court justice anthony m kennedy 
to let it broadcast the noriegalawyer tapes 
earlier this week lawyers for cnn and noriega struck an 
agreement under which the network will not broadcast tapes of 
noriega talking to his lawyers until receiving some word from the 
supreme court 
noriega is accused of accepting 46 million in bribes from 
colombias medellin cocaine cartel he has been held at a federal 
prison outside miami since his surrender to us forces shortly 
after the us invasion of panama in december 
federal prison officials say inmates telephone conversations 
routinely are monitored except when the prisoners state they are 
talking to their lawyers but cnn said it has tapes that include 
conversations between noriega and his defense team

yevgeny primakov the top soviet envoy for the 
middle east said thursday the world should do everything 
possible to encourage iraq to leave kuwait peacefully including 
agreeing to talks on the palestinian question 
primakov a member of the presidential council that advises 
soviet president mikhail s gorbachev reiterated the kremlins 
desire to avoid a military conflict in the persian gulf he said 
iraqi leader saddam hussein should be given the opportunity for a 
facesaving withdrawal from kuwait 
but its very difficult to make a distinction between 
facesaving and rewarding him he said at a news conference 
before receiving an award from the citizens exchange council for 
promoting better ussoviet relations 
in a later speech to the council primakov proposed a flexible 
linkage between iraqs withdrawal and a conference to resolve the 
israelipalestinian dispute 
we could inform him about our intentions to take steps toward 
an international conference he said 
saddam has demanded that a withdrawal from kuwait be linked to 
establishment of a palestinain homeland president bush has 
rejected placing specific conditions for an iraqi withdrawal but 
said other issues could be discussed after a pullout 
bush recently has bolstered us forces in saudi arabia saying 
the troops must be capable of launching an offensive action us 
officials say they intend to add about 200000 soldiers to the 
230000 already there 
the soviet union is the past has indicated it might approve of 
military action against iraqi forces under a un command if 
peaceful measures fail 
but primakov said thursday that we must do everything possible 
to force a withdrawal everything in our power for a political 
solution 
the alternative is a military solution that would have 
terrible consequences not only in loss of life but in further 
destabilizing the region said primakov who has made two trips to 
baghdad to meet with iraqi officials 
as part of arranging a political solution to the gulf crisis 
primakov also proposed establishing a scheme of regional 
security that would include limits on iraqs chemical weapons 
arsenal and the withdrawal of the multinational military force 
opposing iraq 
meanwhile the united states is expected to circulate a un 
security council resolution by the end of november to authorize 
collective un force to drive iraq from kuwait diplomats said 
thursday 
in an interview with the new york times on thursday primakov 
said the security council should not be pushed into adopting such a 
resolution while negotiations with iraq are being pursued 
iraq invaded its tiny oilrich neighbor on aug 2 in a dispute 
over oil money and land

an infinite series of rooms rolls by a man and 
woman levitate in the vaulted interior of the chartres cathedral 
and wheel in a somber aerial pas de deux mc eschers 
mathematical illusions come to life 
these images are the hyperreality of highdefinition television 
or hdtv and its here now so youd better get used to being 
massaged by a new medium 
hdtv pictures are alive stunning in the complexity of their 
color and detail somewhere marshall mcluhan is laughing 
television the cool medium with its lowresolution picture is 
suddenly very very hot 
theres a sense of being there a sense of nowness a 
certain believability about it that film or television just cant 
do said david niles a new york citybased producer who 
specializes in hdtv 
were really sure now that were looking at a whole new 
medium not just better television better cinema niles said 
the way that you see it is totally different 
we dont know too much about perception with this 
technology said zbigniew rybczynmski a video artist based in 
hoboken nj and winner of an academy award for his short film 
tango 
the technology is a lot more than big television said barry 
rebo who heads the first hdtv production company in the united 
states were not in the television business he said were 
in the widescreen highdefinition imaging business 
the work of these men and their collaborators is on exhibit at 
the museum of broadcasting here through nov 24 they and their 
works are at the cutting edge of a new technology whose owners 
manual still is being written 
it boils down to resolution the horizontal lines that 
constitute a video image a standard tv picture has 330 lines a 
typical vhs videocassette recorder has 240 lines thats why vhs 
images have a soft look 
a topofthe line super vhs vcr or a laservision disc player put 
out 425 lines of resolution thats about 60 percent sharper than 
vhs the most advanced tv monitor you can buy displays about 700 
lines of resolution 
an hdtv signal is at least 1125 lines of resolution formated 
with the 169 widescreen aspect ratio instead of the 43 
proportions of our comfy old boob tube 
in addition the highresolution electronic image is much easier 
to manipulate than film or videotape special effects can get 
spectacularly surreal 
since high definition is so new there really arent any rules 
about what you can or cant do said niles 
the analogy is that hdtv is to conventional tv as oldtime 
silent movies are to todays giantscreen theatrical movies shot on 
70mm stock 
that analogy breaks down however when cinema and tv 
technicians try to use the new technology as media maestro mcluhan 
prophesied eyes accustomed to the old media have trouble adjusting 
to the new 
it takes a long time to learn how to make high definition 
simple things like making people laugh or scaring them is different 
on high definition niles said the jokes are bigger in 
highdefinition television timing that worked on television 
doesnt work in high definition 
hdtvs startling reality leads to an unwilling suspension of 
disbelief a lessening of the intellectual distance between the 
viewer and what is viewed niles said 
its changing the way you tell a story he said it 
becomes more impressionistic like something you dream 
elsewhere in the world hdtv is a multibilliondollar industry 
japans nhk the national broadcasting company airs a daily 
hour of hdtv programming and is gearing up for eight hours a day 
there are 78 highdefinition theaters in japan the united 
states has none but niles who has refurbished new yorks old ed 
sullivan theater said hell open an hdtv theater there with a 
40foot screen within months 
right now i can count on two hands the number of 
highdefinition producers in the world niles said in the united 
states there are six and their output is small he said 
here hdtv is a buzzword for the united states ceding to japan 
the leadership in electronic technology and consumer goods that 
was a decision made by us industry and its not really the 
problem niles and rebo said 
weve made such a political battle out of it that the public 
has a perception of high definition that is more myth than 
reality niles said 
whos going to make the tv sets he said who cares whos 
going to make the programming thats important 
 
elsewhere in television 
american chronicles tackles hef the life and times of hugh 
marston hefner the man who created playboy magazine in 1954 are 
the subject of saturday nights american chronicles on fox 
broadcasting co 
for the generation of american males who grew up within 
playboys fantasy its good to see how well hef has aged for the 
american woman theres not much of interest here 
theres an interview with hefner that reveals very little 
theres footage and stills of him in younger days remarkable 
mostly for the startling style changes in hair makeup and ladies 
foundation garments 
like playboy and hefner the program is saucy in its use of 
attractive young women in varying states of undress and like 
playboy and hef it is sadly irrelevant to the sporadic firefights 
of the waning sexual revolution

anticipated as if it were an impending earthquake or volanic 
eruption but when it actually occurs it provides no sign of any 
sort by which it may be recognized 
it is recession a subject that would leave a gaping hole in 
news reports if it couldnt be forecast discussed warned about or 
looked back on but when it comes and when it goes nobody knows 
and it makes no difference anyway 
yet if there were an economic question of the day so to speak 
the question of whether were in a recession would win by default 
no other economic question is posed more often or more often left 
unanswered 
making the situation even harder to understand is that the 
questions and the answers really have little or no significance 
other than to satisfy the nagging desire for perfection in a very 
imperfect economic science 
the word recession is really just a technical word for a 
weakened economy it is not a scientific term in the same sense as 
for instance superconductivity or hypertension two other terms 
used quite often today 
it is very important to almost everyone when the economy 
weakens there is no question about that but it matters little to 
everyone or even anyone that the economy has crossed a somewhat 
arbitrary line and entered recession 
the definition most often used in declaring a recession to exist 
is when the total output of goods and services the socalled gross 
national product shrinks for two straight threemonth periods 
using that definition you are of course in recession before you 
realize it but so what all along you might have thought the 
economy was merely weak as indicated by your paycheck your job 
security your companys declining profits your neighbors layoff 
the decline of state tax revenues and so on 
and essentially you were correct the mere passing of a 
technical line on the way down didnt change the economy a bit it 
didnt alter its appearance or its ingredients or make it any 
better or any worse not at all 
what it might have done is please those who had forecast a 
recession was coming displease those who said it wasnt satisfied 
economic technicians who made the discovery endangered the 
political future of some elected officials 
but unless the decline was abrupt the declaration that a 
recession existed probably had no greater impact on your wallet 
than a comparable nonrecessionary economic weakening 
the occasion leaves not a trace there is no great change in the 
monthtomonth appearance or performance of an economy still 
advancing at an annual rate of onetenth of one percent and one 
declining by the same amount 
crossing the recessionary line is a nonevent an odd contrast 
to all the hulaballoo that precedes it far more important is 
whether the decline continues and for how long and whether it 
deepens or weakens 
events on the way up from recession are similar nobody really 
knows that the line is crossed until months afterward and nobody 
should really care the important thing is that growth has resumed

its only 90 miles from cuba to florida but 
its taken cuban jazz trumpeter arturo sandoval thousands of miles 
and many years to make that short trip between two different 
worlds 
considered cubas foremost jazz artist sandoval defected while 
on tour in italy with dizzy gillespies united nation orchestra he 
turned up at the us embassy in rome on july 22 with a small 
suitcase and trumpet requesting political asylum 
at the same time his wife marianela and 14yearold son 
arturo jr who had been allowed to join him in europe sought 
asylym at the american embassy in london within days they were 
settled in miami with its large cuban population 
i didnt want my son to grow up there with all the problems 
sandoval said the principle thing is to feel free thats 
no 1 
one of my dreams in life has been to come here to the united 
states the land of jazz the music that i love 
as a jazz artist sandoval suffered for playing americas 
indigenous music in a country whose communist government is 
staunchly antiyankee while performing his compulsory military 
service almost 20 years ago he was imprisoned for four months 
after he was caught listening to a us jazz broadcast 
they said i was a jazz lover which meant that i was 
proamerican sandoval said in a telephone interview from his 
home in miami 
i felt that i was losing my life my time and my talent 
because there were so few opportunities to play he said 
since coming to the united states the 41yearold sandoval is 
furiously making up for lost time 
he has formed his own sextet with cubanamerican musicians in 
miami and is currently touring europe again with dizzys 
multinational big band he recorded a trumpet solo for dave 
grusins soundtrack for havana the soontobe released film 
about 1950s cuba starring robert redford 
in march he plans to perform a haydn trumpet concerto with the 
london festival orchestra he also has appeared with the bbc 
symphony in london and the leningrad symphony 
but what distinguishes him is his latinstyle jazz trumpet 
blending blazing afrocuban and salsa rhythms with bebop 
influences spiced with earbursting highnote playing 
on a recent monday night in new york sandovals cheeks puffed 
out and turned bright red as he hit stratospheric notes in guest 
appearances with two fellow cuban expatriates veteran conga player 
mongo santamaria and saxophonist paquito d rivera at the village 
gate 
standing backstage enjoying the proceedings was gillespie 73 
who befriended sandoval during a visit to cuba in the 1970s and 
later introduced him to american audiences 
hes one of the real phenomenons of these times hes 
unbelievable its a pleasure to work with the guy gillespie 
said of his younger protege 
hes the definitive cuban trumpeter of the 1990s he has that 
real cuban soul and he has the knowledge of the work of all the 
major trumpet players of the last 40 or 50 years 
gillespie is widely credited with pioneering the marriage of 
jazz and afrocuban music when he recruited the legendary cuban 
conga player chano pozo to play in his bebop big band in 1947 
sandoval was born in 1949 in the town of artemisa about 30 
miles outside havana his father was a car mechanic his mother a 
housewife at the age of 12 he began playing trumpet in his towns 
marching brass band often performing at political rallies in the 
early days of the cuban revolution 
his life changed when he heard a 1947 bebop recording featuring 
dizzy and saxophonist charlie bird parker 
it was around 1964 sandoval recalled i got crazy when i 
heard that i said its impossible to play like that that 
bebop music infected me in my brain 
dizzy will be my hero forever i admire him as a genius 
musician and a great person to play with him and have the 
chance of being his friend is the most important thing that has 
happened in my life 
but it wasnt easy for sandoval to pursue his passion for jazz 
there was no jazz on the radio and the us trade embargo and 
travel restrictions made records hard to come by 
he and a small circle of friends shared the treasured jazz 
recordings brought back by the occasional traveler to the west and 
he managed to be influenced by louis armstrong clifford brown 
woody shaw miles davis and other american jazz trumpeters 
sandoval studied classical trumpet at the national school of art 
in havana and in the late 1960s began performing with the cuban 
orchestra of modern music using it as a cover to play some jazz 
in 1973 after completing his army service he joined drivera 
and other young musicians in founding irakere a seminal band which 
modernized the link between jazz and cuban music using electronic 
instruments along with traditional cuban drums the grammywinning 
band became one of cubas most popular musical exports winning 
acclaim in europe and the united states 
sandoval left irakere in 1981 to form his own jazz group because 
he wanted to play more of his own compositions the ministry of 
culture gave him little support because it wanted him to stay in 
irakere 
i had to fight for everything even getting the instruments 
was hard he said the government buys instruments and parcels 
them out among preferred musicians sandoval had to buy most of his 
equipment abroad 
sandoval planned his escape for years stashing some of his 
possessions with friends in europe whenever he had the opportunity 
to tour but he waited for the opportunity to get his wife and son 
out of cuba before defecting 
before he began a sixmonth european tour in may he told the 
ministry of culture he wouldnt go and they would lose their 
share of his earnings unless his family could join him for a 
vacation 
the cuban government reacted to his defection by issuing a 
statement in times of danger rats abandon the ship to drown 
themselves in a sea of infinite shame 
sandoval is trumpeting his freedom vowing to blow harder than 
ever now that he has the chance to play his music anywhere he 
wants 
i play with all my head and my heart said sandoval i put 
all my life into the hole of the mouthpiece i explore my life 
through my trumpet 
when i play i always think im going to die the next day so 
i put out everything ive got

george esper who covered the vietnam war for 
the associated press from 1965 until its end in 1975 interviewed 
former red cross worker cherie rankin before her return to vietnam 
here are her reflections of her journey into the past 
 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
like a growing number of americans who 
served in vietnam cherie rankin returned there after 20 years to 
help rebuild a small part of what the war destroyed 
in doing so she also restored a part of her life 
i think what it means is theres been enough distance from the 
trauma to make it safe for people to deal with it she said it 
means relations between our two countries are going to improve 
for six weeks ms rankin a former red cross worker labored in 
the punishing sun mixing mortar to help build a medical clinic near 
hanoi destroyed by us bombers 
at the end of october she came home to the united states for 
the second time a twiceinalifetime experience she cried 
for the living she left behind this trip the last time in 1971 
it was for the dead 
two decades ago she brought back with her the images of war 
orphans scorched by napalm and blinded by bombs this time she 
came back with images of carefree curious clinging children who 
followed her wherever she went 
returning home she clutched a hat full of love the conical hat 
her vietnamese coworkers signed as a remembrance on the day the 
clinic was finished and they parted with warm embraces and tears 
there was a lot of crying that day she recalled 
in a sense her return was part of a broader pilgrimage by 
americans in recent years their return is a sentimental journey a 
reconnecting with their past when they were young men and women 
undergoing a transcendent experience 
ms rankin was only 24 then for more than 10 years after she 
came home the first time in september 1971 after a years tour 
thinking about vietnam made her sick to her stomach she threw up 
at a reunion of red cross workers in 1984 
today at age 44 she said vietnam revisited has probably 
exorcised the demons from her mind that even counseling couldnt 
capture ms rankin herself is a psychotherapist 
i think it has probably put a closure on it in a way that it 
hadnt before she said i probably will never use the word 
resolve its not something i want to have resolved i dont ever 
want to forget the pain of the war because i might become 
complacent about war 
her return helped change the images in her mind of napalmed 
babies starving children and the poverty and sadness she read in 
the faces of the vietnamese when she was there two decades before 
what i see now is happy children sparkle and twinkles in 
the eyes of the people going on with their lives ms rankin 
said theres still incredible poverty but its not so dirty 
theyre not starving because they grow their own food and are able 
to do that now 
they still dont have things still live in small homes and 
they dont have access to good medical care but its not the same 
kind of thing that happened during the war when they were displaced 
from their ancestral roots and their agricultural attachment to the 
land 
ms rankin was part of a group of seven american civilians and 
military veterans who paid their own way to vietnam to build badly 
needed medical facilities they were the third team of americans to 
return under the auspices of the veterans vietnam restoration 
project in garberville calif 
only nongovernmental american organizations can give vietnam 
humanitarian aid since the two governments have no diplomatic 
relations and the united states has imposed a trade embargo on the 
country 
ms rankin said most of the vietnamese expressed interest in 
restoring relations so there could be free trade communications 
and travel 
they really are puzzled by our continued boycott of them and 
they were constantly in wonder of us she said it was 
impossible to walk down the street without being surrounded by 
adults as well as children 
i think that i and its probably true for the other veterans 
that went with me represented something bigger to the vietnamese 
the people we met saw us as representatives of our government so 
there was a sense that things were softening fifteen years 
is long enough to hold a grudge 
kevin bowen a veteran and codirector of the william joiner 
center for the study of war and social consequences at the 
university of massachusetts at boston said americans returning to 
vietnam are finding it a way of healing some of the mental wounds 
of the war 
i think for veterans in this country its important to get 
this episode behind us said bowen who has made five trips back 
to vietnam we need to have different relations with vietnam and 
with our past and not an angry vindictive relationship were not 
just punishing vietnam were punishing ourselves 
ms rankin returned to vietnam with the intention of mourning 
the men whose hands she held as they lay dying and the vietnamese 
orphans she embraced the blind the legless the retarded 
she had detached herself from her feelings during the war in 
order to do the job of building morale among the gis 
this time work got in her way 
i didnt really have a lot of time she said the work was 
very exhausting we also had a lot of demands on our afterhours 
time going to meet their governing bodies to functions and to 
cultural events 
but she cried when she said goobye to her vietnamese friends at 
the clinic and when she visited the grounds of the sacred heart 
orphanage in da nang where she had tended the children in her free 
time 
the orphanage was almost exactly as she remembered it but the 
children had been moved to another home south of da nang in one of 
the many ironies of vietnam sacred heart now is home for old 
people who have nobody their children killed in the war 
after the clinic was built ms rankin spent two more weeks in 
vietnam she retraced her wartime steps in what was then south 
vietnam basking in the moments that almost seemed unreal and 
remembering 
the sites stepped out of history to meet her marble mountain 
monkey mountain china beach 
she recognized them all

gloom has replaced the euphoria 
that enveloped czechoslovakias peaceful revolution a year ago 
economic worries abound and slovak nationalism threatens to split 
the country 
ordinary people are fearful without the economic security the 
old communist system provided economists forecast that 
unemployment and inflation will rise rapidly as the nation converts 
to capitalism 
president vaclav havel the former dissident playwright who 
personified the velvet revolution has acknowledged the 
national malaise 
a question is looming over this state whether it is dying due 
to its own faults he said in a television speech oct 28 the 
72nd anniversary of czechoslovakias birth we do not have too 
many reasons to be satisfied 
such national uncertainty has seldom been matched since the 
czechs and slovaks joined in 1918 after centuries of domination by 
the austrohungarian empire to create czechoslovakia 
the two nations were separated by the nazis during world war ii 
and afterward czechoslovakia spent 40 years as part of the soviet 
bloc 
now with the disintegration of the communist empire slovak 
separatism is resurgent and the threat of another separation has 
become real 
slovaks make up about onethird of the 155 million people and 
occupy the more rural eastern part of czechoslovakia under the 
centralized communist government nearly all slovak affairs were 
decided in prague the federal capital 
discord between czechs and slovaks seemed nonexistent a year 
ago they filled the streets together to bring down the old regime 
czechoslovakias revolution began nov 17 1989 when police 
brutally beat thousands of students demonstrating for more rapid 
democratic change of the kind that was transforming poland hungary 
and east germany 
the police brutality inspired street protests that toppled the 
communist party politburo seven days later before the end of the 
year havel and fellow dissidents were in power 
havel visited several countries in the ensuing months back 
home the mood remained euphoric with rising crime and increasing 
nationalism seen as relatively minor problems accompanying the 
revolution 
because about 5 million czechoslovaks were at least indirectly 
beholden to the communists the interim governments campaign 
against the party was not entirely successful 
in elections june 8 havels civic forum and public against 
violence its slovak sister organization won 57 percent of the 
vote the turnout was 97 percent 
the first economic shocks came after the elections food prices 
were raised gasoline prices went up 50 percent and train fares 
doubled disillusionment spread and many people had a sense of 
betrayal 
we disregard our everyday worries for the sake of discussing 
privatization leaving the spiritual values aside daniela 
kolarova an actress and member of parliament said earlier this 
year we keep hearing the argument that once the economy starts 
functioning there will be time for the soul 
slovak nationalists have held mass demonstrations for months in 
midnovember thousands of slovaks marched in bratislava capital 
of slovakia demanding secession they were angered by their 
regional governments efforts to reach agreement on power sharing 
with the czech and fed administrations 
some members of the slovak parliament also have demanded a 
separate nation 
the resurgent slovak separatism cast a cloud over the 72nd 
anniversary ceremonies and led havel to appeal for cooperation 
i believe our reason our sense of togetherness our 
responsibility culture as well as the instinct for 
selfpreservation will prevail he said in the televised address 
some people old enough to remember the two separate nations seem 
to be preparing for the memory to become reality again 
it just may be that the end of the communist excursion into 
history could bring the end of the czechoslovak experiment too 
a 78year old czech told a reporter who asked his opinion

a landmark arms treaty cutting nonnuclear 
forces in europe is far from the final step in disarmament but it 
offers one overarching reward the end to fear of a massive 
surprise ground attack 
it also may open the way for the eventual elimination of us 
and soviet nuclear weapons from europe some analysts believe 
although that issue is strongly debated 
the conventional forces in europe or cfe treaty scheduled to 
be signed monday in paris alters the military balance in europe 
mainly by erasing moscows ability to mass huge numbers of tanks 
and other heavy armor in central europe 
it is the definitive end of the surprise attack option for 
the soviets said jonathon dean a former us representative to 
eastwest conventional arms negotiations 
nato and warsaw pact negotiators in vienna reached tentative 
agreement thursday on the last details diplomats said 
hungarys chief negotiator ambassador istvan gyarmati said the 
last minor disagreements were worked out at a plenary meeting of 
the 22 nations belonging to the two military alliances 
other diplomats who spoke on condition of anonymity also said 
a tentative agreement had been reached 
from the start of the cold war and the creation first of nato in 
1949 and then the sovietled warsaw pact alliance the military 
landscape of western europe has been dominated by fear of a bolt 
from the blue communistbloc ground assault 
to eliminate that perceived threat the cfe treaty limiting 
the weapons of 22 countries and covering european territory from 
the atlantic ocean to the ural mountains requires the soviets to 
drastically reduce their forces includin 
tanks from about 41000 before the treaty negotiations began 
in 1989 to 13150 moscow already has reduced its tank holdings in 
the territory covered by the treaty to about 21000 mainly by 
moving its best models east as replacements for older ones 
the allowable number tanks for all of eastern europe will be 
20000 the united states and its nato allies also will be allowed 
20000 tanks that will require a cut of about 4000 for nato 
although more than 1000 of the topoftheline american m1a1 
tanks already are being moved from europe to saudi arabia 
armored combat vehicles from the 32300 now deployed by the 
soviets to 20000 nato will not have to make any cuts in this 
category which includes such warfighting machinery as the us 
bradley fighting vehicle used to move infantry protect maneuvering 
tanks and help consolidate gains in an offensive 
artillery pieces providing the essential firepower for a 
combat operation from about 52000 for the soviets before the cfe 
negotiations began to 13175 the soviets already have reduced to 
18300 nato will stay at its current level of 18500 
those three weapon categories tanks armored combat vehicles 
and artillery are especially important to the military balance in 
europe because they form the core of nonnuclear offensive 
capability for both the soviets and nato 
once the treaty is implemented neither side will be able to 
marshal enough firepower within striking range of the other to 
launch a land invasion without setting off warning bells months or 
even years in advance analysts say 
because most of the cuts will be made by the soviets no 
significant cost savings will be felt immediately by the nato 
countries according to the institute for defense and disarmament 
studies a research group based at brookline mass 
the treaty does not include cuts in military personnel in 
europe a ussoviet agreement last february to limit each side to 
195000 foreign troops in central europe plus an additional 30000 
us troops elsewhere in europe has been abandoned the plan was 
overtaken by events including the soviets declared intent to 
withdraw all their forces from central europe within four years 
the newly unified germanys agreement to limit the size of its 
armed forces and the dissolution of the warsaw pact as a coherent 
military force 
just last month washington announced it would unilaterally 
withdraw 40000 troops from western europe and close some of its 
bases there then on nov 8 president bush ordered about 100000 
us army combat forces from europe to saudi arabia as 
reinforcements against iraq that cuts us army strength in europe 
by onehalf although it was presumed that some of those troops 
would later return to europe 
most of the weapons to be withdrawn from europe under the cfe 
treaty will be destroyed although the treaty permits some to be 
converted to nonmilitary or military support purposes 
neither the soviets and their warsaw pact partners nor the 
united states and its nato allies will be required to destroy any 
attack helicopters limited by the treaty those in excess of the 
2000 permitted by the treaty can be converted to noncombat roles 
for other combat aircraft the soviets will be required to 
eliminate about onethird of their inventory in the area covered by 
the treaty no cuts are required of the nato countries because they 
already are well below the treaty limit of 6800 combat aircraft

wendie jo sperber had misgivings about taking 
the leading part in the fox networks babes shes always been 
a supporting player and it was the first time her weight had any 
bearing on a role 
the series about three overweight sisters sharing an apartment 
began with a heavy emphasis on fat jokes but has become the story 
of three women who could be any size trying to juggle their lives 
and relationships in close quarters 
fat is not really what its about now ms sperber said 
during a recent rehearsal break the original script for the 
pilot had a lot of fat jokes but it was rewritten and by the time 
we did the pilot i said wow this is great then when i saw it 
i realized there were still fat jokes in there 
but its really about their love and struggle and survival 
its a more sensitive subject than i realized its like gee can 
i laugh at her 
in the thursday night comedy series ms sperber stars as middle 
sister charlene susan peretz plays the oldest sibling darlene 
and lesley boone is the youngest marlene 
in the pilot darlene pours a whole box of cereal into a 
bowl ms sperber said an overweight person would laugh at 
that maybe a thin person wouldnt think it funny even the bed 
collapsing theyre all things that could happen you dont have 
to pound people over the head but you cant ignore the fat jokes 
and we do make the jokes ourselves its not someone else joking 
about us 
the actress points out that valerie harpers rhoda is fondly 
remembered from the mary tyler moore show yet all of the 
laughs were at fat jokes until miss harper lost weight 
ms sperber previously played somewhat offbeat supporting 
characters in such tv series as bosom buddies freestyle 
women in prison and private benjamin 
i was in the army in prison and lived with two men in drag 
she said i was an evil troll with a rose nose in a pbs show for 
children freestyle weve all had those kind of roles in 
babes i seem to have broken my stream of strange things 
nonetheless playing the straight lead for a change took a 
little getting used to 
the producers wanted me to play the role im now playing but 
i wanted to read for darlene she said i felt it was more like 
what i was used to playing id always been the character who comes 
on says her lines and leaves 
charlene is kind of set up as the leading lady thats more 
pressure on my shoulders than im used to but charlene is like the 
mary tyler moore whos at the center im really like a straight 
man shes the stable one the logical one i said how boring 
but its a sitcom and everybodys funny now im having a great 
time 
ms sperber is married and has two children both born since 
her last series women in prison she identified her husband 
only as richard whos in public relations 
charlene is really happy really content she said she 
has a great boyfriend a great job shes probably happy her 
sisters have moved in with her she has a lot of confidence and 
selfesteem and a good selfimage i wish i had more of her 
contentment about myself 
everyone is so wrapped up in looks today come on its our 
lives its ridiculous the way people will wreck their day or week 
about their looks calm down dont be suicidal over such things 
raised in the san fernando valley area of los angeles ms 
sperber began her career appearing in theatrical films after she 
was spotted by a casting director in a hollywood play while still 
in high school 
a casting director came around and thats how i got grease 
she said i was a dancer and i worked one day then i got 
corvette summer i never went back to grease 
she was a fanatic beatles fan in i wanna hold your hand a 
manhungry woman at a uso dance in 1941 and appeared in such 
other movies as moving violations bachelor party and 
used cars 
in bosom buddies ms sperber was the only one who knew tom 
hanks and peter scolari were in drag so they could live in an 
allwomen residence 
she was one of lorna pattersons barracks buddies in private 
benjamin 
lorna patterson said the lines and i did the facial 
expressions on private benjamin she said my last series was 
women in prison i lived in a cell i had a lot of power i was 
the leader of the pack i had a tv a vcr a microwave 
when i talk about it it sounds like a funny show but it 
wasnt when youre doing a show you dont know if its good or 
not

hosts of olive ridley turtles crawl 
from the thundering surf in a season more peaceful than the last 
to lay their eggs on a beach that stretches to the horizon 
olive ridleys were butchered by the tens of thousands a year 
ago but in may the government forbade the killing 
fishing boats no longer prowl the waters off the main nesting 
beach the slaughterhouse 12 miles away is silent and abandoned 
its roof collapsed inside the concreteblock walls 
not all the danger is gone however 
biologists working out of a nearby camp still race egg thieves 
to the nests authorities recently confiscated 944 skins 
representing half as many dead turtles in a village up the coast 
known in the past for clandestine slaughter 
fishermen who lived by killing sea turtles have few 
alternatives 
those in the cooperative at san agustinillo where the 
slaughterhouse sits derelict were well off last season now they 
wonder how to feed their families 
we all know the ecologists have money to take food home every 
day without any problem and theyve put us on a diet silverio 
alvarez said of the pressure to stop the killing of sea turtles 
by all accounts there are more turtles this year in part 
because of the ban and in part it seems because its just a good 
year for turtles 
i think i could definitely say the death toll has decreased 
said georgita ruiz a veterinarian who has studied turtles for 13 
years 
there are more turtles nesting on the beach than in previous 
years they have natural surges in nesting activity but i think 
its logical that if there isnt as much disturbance where theyre 
going to nest youre going to see more 
she added however people are still people and theyre still 
hungry theyre going to beg borrow steal or kill to get what 
they need 
ms ruiz runs the pronatura conservation organizations turtle 
program at escobilla 300 miles southeast of mexico city on the 
pacific coast of oaxaca state 
elpidio marcelino lopez said the 10 to 15 boats he saw capturing 
turtles 200 yards off the beach last year arent there this season 
marcelino is a biologist from oaxaca state university who has spent 
several seasons at the escobilla camp 
conservationists say some killing continues despite the ban 
decreed by president carlos salinas de gortari 
we know there are two clandestine slaughterhouses said 
homero aridjis president of the group of 100 environmental group 
he said they were discovered on secondary nesting beaches one 
of which also is used by leatherback turtles aridjis said there 
was no indication how many turtles were being processed there 
biologists move the eggs from nests on the beach to nursery 
areas at the camp 
if we had 200 nests theyd steal 201 marcelino said of the 
egg thieves 
mexico was the worlds leading killer of sea turtles and japan 
its biggest customer 
the victims generally were olive ridleys the most numerous of 
the seven species of sea turtles six of the seven species are 
found in mexico 
what makes olive ridleys special are their arribadas mass 
nestings that occur about once a month from july to december 
biologists estimate 75000 nested on 1 miles of the escobilla 
beach during the october arribada more than in all of 1988 and 
more than half the 1989 total 
marcelino also said more are nesting between arribadas this 
year 
pairs of turtle tracks make stripes on the beach one from the 
water the other returning their edges scrolled like ocean waves 
the tracks going up the beach are a bit deeper because of the 10 
pounds of eggs in a 100pound turtle 
if there is only one track a turtle is at the end of it her 
back flippers curled like hands scoop out a hole where she lays 
100 or so eggs the size of pingpong balls then she fills the hole 
tamping down the sand and heads back to the sea 
olive ridleys have nine other major nesting beaches worldwide 
but the level of killing wiped out the two or three other major 
sites in mexico 
there was no reason to think oaxaca wouldnt go the same 
way ms ruiz said 
an estimated 70000 turtles were killed in 1989 the legal 
limit divided among licensed cooperatives was 23000 
in addition to forbidding the olive ridley kill the 
presidential decree increased the government commitment to enforce 
bans on killing other turtle species and the taking and selling of 
eggs shells skins and other products it also supports research 
in san agustinillo there were two things to do capture turtles 
or work at the slaughterhouse both stopped at the end of may 
sometimes we borrow money or you dont eat beans you eat 
tortillas just to buy school supplies for the children said 
alvarez the idle fisherman 
he said he had earned about 140 from turtles during peak 
months as much in five days as fish brought the rest of the month 
with their minds on nesting turtles are easy to grab 
shark fishing a likely alternative means going so far to sea 
you can lose sight of land he said more fuel and maintenance for 
the boat and without a radio more danger 
new boats motors trucks and nets the government fishing 
department gave cooperatives do not make up for the loss alvarez 
said 
fishermen contend there are plenty of turtles those outside 
cooperatives are blamed for much of the illegal killing before the 
ban and now 
even with all the vigilance we have the nesting beaches are 
very extensive said myrna wong of the fishing department you 
cant cover all of it at the same time 
todd steiner director of the sea turtle project of earth island 
institute agreed the ban had been effective but also said i 
think if the international environmental community goes to sleep 
all the turtles will get is a temporary reprieve 
on a busy saturday in mexico citys tepito market famous for 
contraband four vendors hawked turtle eggs a delicacy at three 
for the equivalent of 170 
businesses were required to register their turtle products after 
the decree but there was no deadline on selling nonperishable 
products that makes tracing new stock an indication of poaching 
more difficult 
authorities have confiscated large amounts of tortoise shell a 
product of the hawksbill but homero aridjis president of the 
group of 100 environmental organization said it still is available 
in stores 
two men selling partturtle boots were certain they wouldnt run 
out 
theres always clandestine trade hector guevara said 
making a gesture under the table

elpidio marcelino lopez cut the lights 
of his red threewheeled dune cycle amd skimmed over the dark sand 
in friendly pursuit of olive ridley sea turtles 
any day the turtles were expected to have an arribada a 
nesting on the beach at night by the tens of thousands marcelinos 
mission was to learn whether it had begun 
theres one laying eggs he said gesturing toward loose 
sand above the hightide mark without breaking speed theres one 
covering the nest 
another olive ridley climbed from the rolling surf 
marcelino is one of 10 biologists from universities the 
pronatura conservation organization and federal fishing department 
who work at escobilla site of 80 percent to 90 percent of the 
olive ridley nesting in mexico 
after turtles lay their eggs and return to the sea marcelino 
and the others dig into the sand elbow deep remove the eggs and 
rebury them in a nursery area at the camp otherwise looters will 
get them by morning 
in 42 days slatecolored hatchlings the size of silver dollars 
will emerge and head for the sea it will be the last time on land 
for most of the males which will grow larger than dishpans but may 
not reproduce for 20 years 
because moving the eggs cuts the survival rate by about half 
some biologists favor leaving them alone and putting even more 
patrols on the beach 
besides counting the nests every hour and moving the eggs 
biologists check adult turtles for tags and attach new ones 
our function here is to see that the greatest number possible 
get to the sea marcelino said 
he is from a farm near jamiltepec 125 northwest of escobilla 
the fifth of 11 children and understands the people who take eggs 
or used to capture turtles 
i want very much to save the turtle but to help people at the 
same time marcelino said he favors allowing some killing 
because there arent sources of jobs on the coast 
three miles down the beach marcelino turned the dune cycle 
inland taking a trail back to camp through morning glory vines and 
seaside cactus 
the turtles arrived for their arribada six days later

every few months lenny 
labensohn digs his olivedrab uniform and army boots out of the 
closet he packs a shaving kit tosses in a deck of cards and 
becomes a soldier again 
miluim reserve duty is the backbone of the citizen army 
that defends the jewish state every ablebodied israeli male up to 
age 55 is obliged to give a month or two of active service a year 
most israelis see it as a mixed blessing while it disrupts 
their lives and exposes them to physical danger it also offers an 
escape from job and family pressures into the clubby embrace of old 
army buddies 
it is common to see graying men in army fatigues hitchhiking 
home toting m16 rifles but israelis insist theirs is no garrison 
state if anything they feel it gives the army a more human face 
makes it reflect societys values 
nowadays society is deeply divided by the palestinian uprising 
the schism inevitably has reached the reservists who are called 
increasingly into confrontation with unarmed arab rioters 
few have refused outright to do the job but newspapers report a 
new trend called gray refusal finding excuses to avoid 
postings in the occupied territories yedioth ahronoth newspaper 
quoted officers as saying thousands of miluimniks had taken 
this route 
israeli men serve three years in the regular army women serve 
two years but few do reserve duty 
according to the jaffee center for strategic studies the army 
can triple its size by calling up 370000 reservists within a few 
days 
in wartime reservists are summoned at a moments notice but 
otherwise the brown envelope containing the miluim notice 
usually arrives six weeks in advance along with instructions on 
limbering up for army life 
reservists may be posted anywhere from the guerrillaprone 
lebanese border to a palestinian refugee camp in the occupied gaza 
strip 
since the armys philosophy is to treat reservists like 
grownups it isnt particular about long hair or shabby boots 
i enjoy putting on a uniform and stopping being a couch 
potato and going out there and living in nature knowing my body 
can still do it said labensohn a paratroop sergeant who 
immigrated from canada 25 years ago 
at 47 he could ask for a less demanding task like guard duty 
but labensohn feels hes delaying a midlife crisis 
the minute they tell me they dont need me anymore then what 
the hell good am i he said 
labensohn who in civilian life makes promotional films for 
jewish fundraisers sees reserve duty as a social leveler 
you have hotshot lawyers from big corporations in tel aviv 
simple salesmen and bus drivers all in one unit he said i 
would never meet with these kind of people otherwise everybody 
feels good about everybody 
in quiet periods reserve duty averages 30 to 40 days a year 
but an old saying defines the israeli citizen as a soldier on 
extended leave and many served unbroken tours of up to six months 
during and after the 1973 middle east war 
at the height of the palestinian uprising an average of 10000 
men were on duty in the west bank and gaza and reserve tours were 
extended 
natti gefen a 37yearold decorator said palestinians find the 
reservists easier to get along with than young regular army 
soldiers he spoke of arabs who would make a halfhour detour to a 
roadblock manned by reservists 
they see us as suckers he remarked while on duty in gaza 
they told me they think we are weak soldiers because we are too 
good to them 
the transformation from office desk to field post is abrupt 
miluimniks do hard physical work sleep in tents eat army chow 
between patrols gefens comrades relaxed in their small base on 
a hillock overlooking 60000 palestinians crowded into the jabaliya 
refugee camp 
bank teller ephraim dekastro played mahjongg with computer 
operator miki amir they have been in the same unit for 17 years 
on average the the gaza troops were a 90minute drive from home 
and could expect two furloughs a month 
miki amir said the men can talk openly about intimate problems 
because they have been comrades for so long 
our fences come down and it lets us share things that you 
dont even tell your neighbors sometimes even your wife he 
said 
on some tours the men patrol the syrian border or spend a dusty 
month training in tanks like most israeli men they have fought at 
least one war but their four reserve tours in three years have 
been spent chasing stonethrowing palestinians 
they man roadblocks and patrol jabaliyas alleys in jeeps 
dodging firebombs and stones 
nine of the 12 soldiers killed in the uprising were reservists 
death is always on your mind said dani bental a 
freelance writer who recently spent 30 days on the syrian border 
that is the reality of life in israel it is because of this 
reality that we are in miluim 
reservists are compensated for lost earnings but not for 
overtime and perks gefen the decorator said he had to stop 
accepting new commissions two weeks before every tour 
callup dates can be negotiated and exemptions are available to 
those who can prove severe financial or family problems but men 
liable for reserve duty need their commanders permission to travel 
abroad students find their studies severely disrupted 
after the average reserve tour was raised from 40 to 62 days in 
1988 wives mounted an organized protest duty time has been 
trimmed to 42 days 
i learn to function very well without him said labensohns 
wife judy 
i can finagle the bank manager to increase our overdraft i 
can kick the washing machine into doing a rinse i can take the 
puppy to the vet with all three kids and no crying and i can even 
convince the crooks at the garage that consumer awareness has hit 
israel 
lenny goes to the army and comes home and then goes to the 
army again she said it has a rhythm like the seasons but 
the encounter with death snickers from every little brown 
envelope

there is a growing perception within the bush 
administration that soviet president mikhail s gorbachevs power 
is ebbing leading us officials to open lines of communication to 
other levels of the soviet system 
some us officials are searching for ways to shore up 
gorbachevs beleaguered regime while at the same time trying to 
position the united states for a possible realignment of political 
power in the soviet union 
the evidence is clear that power is now moving out of the 
central government to other levels or even out of government 
altogether said one us official who agreed to discuss the 
issue on condition his name not be used the focus now is in the 
republics 
another official said the administration is not worried at 
least not at this point about the soviets ability to live up to 
their international agreements or about any desire to change their 
strategic posture 
international confidence in the kremlins peaceful intentions 
will be on display this week when president bush gorbachev and the 
leaders of 32 other nations gather for the signing of a longsought 
agreement to reduce conventional forces in europe and end the 
military faceoff that divided east and west throughout the cold 
war 
the bush administration doesnt doubt the soviet regimes will 
one source explained but added the danger is that gorbachev may 
lose the ability to make decisions and carry them through 
that official who also spoke on condition of anonymity said 
the united states is now working with reform leaders in the russian 
federation the baltics and elsewhere partly in hopes of shoring 
up gorbachevs political standing at home 
by helping the reform movement at various levels we help 
gorbachev the official said it gives us other access more 
information about whats going on plus its neutraltobeneficial 
for gorbachev because were supporting gorbachev it doesnt 
undermine him 
fourteen of the soviet unions 15 constituent republics have 
declared sovereignty or in a few cases their intention to seek 
complete independence from soviet rule boris yeltsin president of 
the russian federation which accounts for roughly half the soviet 
population is threatening to institute his own reforms that could 
establish an economic system independent of the central government 
the deteriorating soviet economy is at the root of much of the 
publics unhappiness with the central government 
in one sense the shift of power away from the center is quite 
consistent with democratization which the us government has 
supported wholeheartedly one analyst observed but he added that 
it complicates western efforts to support reform 
we recognize that imbalances and uncertainty can lead to 
instability the source said there is a potential for a very 
high level of frustration public indignation a volatile situation 
if economic deterioration continues 
demonstrators from both the left and right showed their anger 
with gorbachev and the economic calamity in revolution day 
demonstrations nov 7 marking the 73rd anniversary of the russian 
revolution 
john hardt a specialist in soviet affairs at the library of 
congress said gorbachev does not appear in imminent danger he 
retains control of the police the military and the kgb the secret 
police agency responsible for state security hrdt noted 
the levers of power are quite clearly in gorbachevs hands 
he said adding that the soviet leader was able to implement 
massive military reductions and set a new course for soviet policy 
in the middle east neither of which could be expected to garner 
strong support from the military establishment or government 
bureaucracy 
but hardt acknowledged that gorbachev is threatened by crises 
rippling through soviet society and that his popularity inside his 
own country is extremely low compared to his status elsewhere in 
the world 
gorbachevs power is becoming more diffuse said a state 
department official also speaking on condition of anonymity but 
we want to be careful not to sell him short hes shown he can 
accomplish a great deal even against tremendous inertia and 
resistance 
time will tell the source said whether this master of 
the old political system can master the new one he has installed 
a source familiar with foreign policy strategy discussions at 
the top levels of the administration said there does not appear to 
be an imminent threat to gorbachev 
there is no apparent challenger no alternative no reason to 
expect military intervention the source said what is more 
likely is that it will become harder for him to exert influence 
to a degree thats a natural result of increasing pluralism 
and we applaud that but whats difficult is the institutional 
structures have not had much time to develop and that makes for an 
unstable situation 
the united states several sources said is continuing to 
support gorbachev while trying to establish contacts at other 
levels particularly where it can encourage economic reform and 
creation of market forces 
arms control agreements still have to be negotiated at the 
central government level one source explained but we can 
provide technical cooperation and support economic activity at both 
levels 
the soviet republics are in some ways similar to the states of 
the united states in that they have government structures that 
mirror the one in moscow under gorbachevs predecessors the 
kremlin dictated practically all policy to the republics but it 
clearly can no longer do that today under pressure from 
nationalists and malcontents in almost every republic it is 
struggling to keep the union from splintering along republic or 
ethnic lines while it negotiates a new balance of power between the 
center and the republics 
the shift in power complicates the effort to back gorbachev and 
his reforms one source said no one has much experience in 
making changes of this sort 
gorbachevs ace in the hole is that he is the only soviet 
leader who has made it on the world stage said another official 
true that doesnt put food on the table but many realize they 
need the west if theyre going to improve and modernize their own 
situation 
much of the soviet leadership recognizes this even if they 
dont like it so gorbachev has a strong card to play in foreign 
relations

cattle producers have said for years they care 
about the environment and do a lot to protect the soil water 
grass and crops that keep them in business now they are seeking to 
prove it 
the national cattlemens association which represents 250000 
producers throughout the country says a new survey shows a growing 
number of cattlemen are active conservationists who care about 
land and water resources 
but that does not mean all cattle producers are in a single 
herd 
critics contend that many cattle producers overgraze pastures 
and ranges allow feedlot runoffs to pollute streams and have poor 
track records in the use of agricultural chemicals 
they also say wrongly according to cattlemen that eating 
red meat is unhealthy besides being hard on the animals 
since 1980 the survey found that about 30 percent of the 
producers have increased the number of manmade stock ponds areas 
with newly planted trees wells and other water developments areas 
that support wildlife and dikes levees and waterways 
in addition the report said 27 percent of the producers plan 
to increase their use of such conservation practices in the next 
five years 
the private survey done for the association was conducted in 
july and august among a random sample of 700 producers in 48 
states the sampling involved cattle producers with more than 100 
head and did not include large commercial feedlots 
john lacey association president said the survey showed that 
conservation and protection of land and water are a part of the 
cattlemans way of life as well as a business venture 
a cattleman depends on the land for his livelihood and to 
assure a livelihood for future generations he must protect and 
improve the environment for which he is responsible lacey said 
the survey shows that 86 percent of cattle producers grow crops 
or hay used as feed of these according to the report 60 percent 
have held the line on use of feed crop production in the past 10 
years and 25 percent have reduced the amount of chemicals they 
use 
as for wildlife habitat 80 percent of those surveyed have areas 
on their farms and ranches that support wildlife and 31 percent 
have increased those ares in the last decade further 39 percent 
plan to increase wildlife areas in the next five years 
the association whose organizational roots go back to 1898 has 
gone on the offensive on a broad front in recent years to defend 
the cattle industry against what many of its members consider 
unfounded and stupid allegations 
as a result the association has distributed information aimed 
at dispelling what it considers falsehoods or slanted claims about 
the beef industry for example 
on the average only 45 pounds of grain are used in producing 
one pound of beef retail weight not the 16 pounds often cited by 
critics who claim fattening cattle on grain is a waste of food 
needed by hungry nations 
world hunger is not caused by shortage of grain in the world 
but rather is a result of poverty lack of buying power and 
problems in food distribution 
cattle are efficient users of resources grazing cattle more 
than doubles the us land area that can be used to produce food 
ruminants grazing animals with four stomachs allow food to be 
harvested from more than one billion acres of range and pasture 
land in the united states 
at least 85 percent of this grazing land is too high too 
rough too dry too wet or too cold to grow cultivated crops 
additionally cattle consume crop residues and food byproducts that 
otherwise would be wasted 
the total amount of water used in onfarm production of 
grainfed beef averages 200 gallons per pound of carcass beef not 
the 2500 gallons often cited by critics 
water for cattle production is not used up it is quickly 
recycled as part of natures hydrological cycle 
most of the energy used in cattle production is solar energy 
used in growing grasses and forage crops as well as feed grains 
grazing alone supplies 57 percent of the feed energy used in 
producing beef cattle 
the fossil fuel energy used to produce 70 pounds of beef 
retail weight the average us per capita consumption is 
equivalent to 1225 gallons of gasoline per year this is just 
onefifteenth of a gallon for four ounces of beef one serving 
beef production accounts for less than 05 percent of total 
energy use in the united states 
one of the thorniest criticisms comes from animal rights 
advocates who contend livestock producers subject animals to 
unnecessary hardships and inhumane practices 
in its pamphlet myths and facts about beef production 
printed on recycled paper and complete with footnoted references 
the association said inhumane practices are not only morally 
wrong they are not economic for producers 
any type of abuse or neglect or harmful practice is 
counterproductive the association said if cattlemen are to 
remain in business and remain on their farms and ranches they must 
be efficient producers 
it added that requires proper feeding health maintenance 
care and handling management of cattle involves handson care 
cattlemen and cattlewomen not machines monitor feed and care for 
their livestock

when democratic leaders looked at the prospect 
of an emergency session of congress on the persian gulf crisis 
they saw an old intractable dilemma over warmaking power so 
congress will investigate instead of trying to legislate 
a question of presidential and congressional powers that has 
gone unresolved for 200 years isnt about to be settled in a 
special session while us forces are at risk against iraq 
there have been repeated attempts to amend the creaky usually 
irrelevant war powers system that already is on the lawbooks none 
successful and what couldnt be done in tranquil times when the 
issues were hypothetical can hardly be accomplished in the midst 
of a giant military buildup in the middle east 
when congressional leaders reminded president bush that congress 
has the power to declare war he took out his own copy of the 
constitution said he understood that and reminded them that it 
also makes him commander in chief 
he also said he has made no decision to take military action and 
would consult with them before using force while he made no 
commitment to seek congressional action in advance of a response to 
iraqi provocation his assurances satisfied the democrats at least 
for the time being 
so the push for a special session of congress to debate and act 
on the gulf crisis an idea launched by republicans has been 
shelved there will be congressional hearings on the 
administrations military and diplomatic policy toward iraq and 
the administration has repeated its promise of continuing 
consultation with house and senate leaders 
the escalated debate last week was prompted by the presidents 
plans to nearly double the size of the us force deployed in saudi 
arabia and the gulf reinforcements the administration said would 
provide an offensive capability for use if needed 
that seemed to be a threat aimed at saddam hussein to turn up 
the pressure for iraqi withdrawal from kuwait but the message 
stirred concern in congress where democrats like sen sam nunn of 
georgia chairman of the armed services committee said there had 
been a fundamental change in policy to an offensive mission of 
liberating kuwait 
he said that was a casebook example of a situation in which 
congress should be called upon for a declaration of war something 
that has happened only five times in us history 
republican sen richard lugar of indiana took the lead in 
proposing a special session of congress which he said should act 
to authorize us operations in a manner that would display 
american unity and staying power 
the white house said a special session was unnecessary because 
there is no war and the president wants to avoid one 
and the democrats werent enthusiastic about the idea either 
sen george j mitchell dmaine the majority leader said there 
should be no special session without a clearly defined purpose 
speaker of the house thomas s foley said he wasnt going to put 
democrats in a potentially embarrassing position 
congress already has voted its overwhelming approval to the 
persian gulf operation in resolutions adopted in october that 
declare support for continued action by the president to deter 
iraqi aggression and protect american lives and vital interests 
in accord with united nations decisions and with us legal 
requirements 
mitchell said there was no way to read into the october 
resolutions any approval for offensive military action they were 
adopted only after repeated declarations that congress was not 
approving anything like the gulf of tonkin resolution the 1964 
measure later cited by the white house as the equivalent of a 
declaration of war in vietnam 
the democratic preference is to wait while international 
economic sanctions take their toll on iraq and presumably force 
saddam to yield it takes 18 months or more 
while republican congressional leaders say thats too long the 
white house isnt talking about specific time frames only about 
maintaining the pressure on saddam hussein and as mitchell said 
that doesnt take congressional approval 
obviously a president need not get a prior act of congress 
to issue a threat mitchell said 
he is supposed to get approval for deployment of american forces 
in hostilities or into situations where imminent involvement in 
hostilities is clearly indicated thats the 1973 war powers law 
enacted over presidential veto opposed by every administration 
since that measure requires congressional approval in order to 
keep us forces in such circumstances for more than 90 days but 
it never has been enforced 
in this case bush advised congress that he did not believe 
involvement in hostilities was imminent that stands although the 
troops involved are receiving the additional pay that goes with 
facing possible hostilities 
force after all is an administration option a clear and 
unmistakable signal according to secretary of state james a 
baker iii the challenge to bush is to keep the pressure on by 
making that worry iraq without shaking his backing at home

caves were a cinch to 
carve in the soft volcanicash face of bandelier meaning these 
centuriesold indian ruins are just as easily erased by fire and 
erosion 
the erosion itself is starting to threaten some of the ruins 
in the back country and that is unacceptable said roy weaver 
superintendent of bandelier national monument the park in the 
jemez mountains 45 miles west of santa fe 
the park boasts 3000 to 5000 archaeological sites dating from 
1100 to 1760 including remnants of threestory pueblos that had as 
many as 400 rooms but time weather and the effects of mans 
encroachment are slowly eating away at bandeliers building blocks 
outside the visitors center in frijoles canyon are the ruins of 
a village called tyuonyi an ellipse of dwellings around a central 
religious chamber or kiva into which people descended by ladder 
tourists may stroll through tyuonyi on an asphalt path and peer 
down into the excavated kiva they also may visit dwellings carved 
into the soft volcanic ash or tuff on the north wall of frijoles 
canyon 
with primitive tools like a good hard oak stick you could 
literally hack yourself a cave into the walls said bob powers a 
national park service archaeologist who is heading a study of 
bandelier 
ladders are provided for visitors to climb into some caves one 
series of ladders leads to a restored kiva cut 140 feet high in the 
cliffs face visitors may enter the kiva 
last year 322000 people wandered through weaver said 
in contrast frijoles canyon had a population of probably no 
more than 700 people at its peak around 1300 to 1550 powers said 
around 1550 tyuonyi was abandoned the reasons remain unclear 
my gut feeling is that a combination of overhunting overuse 
of natural resources a growing population and a lot of competition 
from other pueblos throughout the rio grande valley may have made 
the area not very viable economically powers said 
cochiti pueblo still flourishing nearby is believed to have 
evolved from this settlement a cochiti indian first led swissborn 
anthropologist adolf bandelier into cavestudded frijoles canyon in 
1880 who called it the grandest thing i ever saw 
his 150th birthday aug 6 was celebrated this summer at the 
park which will be 75 years old in february 
powers crews completed their fourth year of field work here in 
august and return in the spring for their final year their 
findings have yet to be analyzed 
our major focus is to try and figure out why the big pueblos 
that appear in the early 1300s why those were built said 
powers why did they all move in together in these big communal 
pueblos 
that was a major change in their cultural habits he said 
one factor almost certainly is a growing population he 
said as population increases there are not as many resources 
the crews have been mapping the thousands of caves and other 
ruins that dot the monuments 32737 acres trying to stay ahead of 
the erosion that periodically sheers off pieces of the cliff 
we have two kinds of erosion one is visitorinduced the 
other is based on previous landmanagement abuses he said 
this goes back over 100 years because of the overgrazing and the 
elimination of fire the natural grasses which were quite extensive 
at the time have been eliminated 
he said overgrazing stopped 60 years ago but much of the damage 
already was done 
the ground is uncovered and erosion is occurring were 
losing in some areas a tenth of an inch of soil per year right 
now he said 
a management statement published last april said the erosion 
problem must be addressed immediately or severe irreversible 
damage will occur to the parks pinonjuniper ecosystems and 
possibly to thousands of associated archaeological sites 
weaver said he doesnt know what the federal budget has in store 
for him so he doesnt know what crews will be able to do about 
erosion 
controlled burning thinning of toodense trees and replanting 
grasses all take money 
firesuppression has caused an overproliferation of pinon and 
juniper scrub trees that actually heighten fire danger weaver 
said 
in 1977 a fire burned through ruins on nearby escobas mesa the 
intense heat and firefighting efforts that included heavy equipment 
turned much of the ruins into dust said judy miles field director 
for the archaeological study 
those ruins like tyuonyi and the other ancient villages of 
bandelier had been made of bricks of tuff powers and miles said 
the tuff was created by two series of cataclysmic eruptions 14 
million and 11 million years ago that formed the nearby valles 
caldera tuff is a mixture of frothy glass bubbles glass shards 
crystal fragments and bits of rock said wolf elston a geologist

thousands of americans are too afraid to 
get into their cars shop at the mall or even venture out of the 
house worried theyll suffer a panic attack 
its a horrible feeling said ann a 51yearold richmond 
real estate agent i feel like im losing control i feel like 
the world around me doesnt exist and i feel like im going to 
die 
ann who asked that her last name be withheld said the panic 
attacks began when she was about 8 but she was too afraid to tell 
anyone 
i didnt even tell my parents she said were very good 
at faking things i didnt know whether i was mentally unbalanced 
people with panic attacks are good liars good excusemakers 
ann had trouble going to the beauty parlor or sitting through a 
sunday church service she started avoiding the places where she 
had the attacks places where she felt closed in 
about 3 million people suffer from panic attacks said dr 
william t riley codirector of the anxiety disorders clinic at 
the medical college of virginia 
most people have experienced at least one or two panic attacks 
in their lifetime he said for it to be something that we 
consider a disorder that we need to treat people need to 
experience about one a week 
the symptoms often mimic a heart attack they include chest 
pain shortness of breath dizziness trembling and sweating 
nausea and abdominal distress 
the disorder is known as agoraphobia when people start avoiding 
places where they experience the attacks 
panic disorders seem to develop primarily in people in their 
20s riley said it can strike anywhere anytime evidence suggests 
people inherit a predisposition to panic attacks othe factors 
indicate outside stress contributes to the problem 
a lot of the people who have panic disorders had problems with 
separation from mom and dad early on he said they had 
difficulty with being left at the baby sitter difficulty going to 
school by themselves 
the attack can last 15 to 30 minutes and more often than not 
people can disguise the fact that theyre having one 
on the outside all theyll usually see in these folks is that 
they look hotter more sweaty theyll shake a little bit and have 
some difficulty talking 
a lot of time they can keep working or hold it together 
the two most frequent things people with panic attacks avoid are 
driving and shopping malls 
theyre real afraid of being trapped and having this panic 
attack happen in front of a bunch of people where they cant get 
out riley said malls are very crowded and there arent a lot 
of exits theyre ok in a shopping center they can get to the 
doors quick 
this month the food and drug administration approved the first 
medication for the treatment of panic disorders xanax known 
generically as alprazolam had been used to treat clinical anxiety 
and anxiety associated with depression 
the drug is manufactured by upjohn co of kalamazoo mich 
executives there said a biochemical malfunctioning in the brain is 
believed to be one of the causes of panic attacks xanax can block 
the attacks by interacting with several different systems in the 
brain 
patients also must learn how to control their behavior riley 
said they learn relaxation techniques they learn how to talk 
themselves out of the episode then they begin to try to tackle 
the things theyre most fearful of 
if theyre fearful of driving because they started to have 
these panic attacks we start working on the drive he said if 
theyre fearful of going to the mall a first step may be nothing 
more than driving there sitting in the parking lot for five 
minutes and going back home 
agoraphobics also attend support group sessions for example in 
richmond about 700 people belong to agoraphobics building 
independent lives 
the treatment is effective about 70 percent to 80 percent of the 
time riley said 
ann who has been working closely with riley said she has 
gotten to the point where she can go to the grocery store a 
discount store and even the beauty salon 
i took my car through the carwash by myself two weeks ago 
she said im still having trouble with the interstates because 
you cant get off of them until the exits 
her most recent assignment was to drive the interstate a little 
each day 
you take a little bit at a time she said if you do it 
without anxiety youve really done something

scientists are searching for ways to improve 
the humble sweet potato a nutritious vegetable that may have a 
future beyond the thanksgiving table in fancy restaurants and 
outer space 
melvin hall a horticulturist at the university of georgias 
coastal plain experiment station in tifton said scientists in 
several states are trying to develop new varieties that give 
growers higher yields and are more resistant to insects and 
diseases 
sweet potatoes a subterranean relative of morning glories are 
high in carbohydrates and vitamins and hall believes they could 
appeal more to healthconscious consumers 
a lot of time people think sweet potatoes are things you eat 
when youre about to starve to death he said wed like to 
think of the sweet potato as something you can find in a fancy 
restaurant 
hall tries to develop improved varieties through genetics 
research each year he plants 10 to 12 acres and then evaluates 
the results he bakes and tastes the most promising sweet potatoes 
he said its difficult to conduct genetics research with sweet 
potatoes because they have six sets of chromosomes compared to 
only two in humans 
its complicated to mathematically figure out what will 
happen he said we have to have thousands and thousands of 
seeds to come up with new genetic combinations that might be better 
than what we already have 
scientists in north and south carolina louisiana mississippi 
and alabama are conducting similar breeding tests researchers in 
other states share information on yields and quality 
hall said scientists at tuskegee university in alabama are 
working with the national aeronautics and space administration on a 
sweet potato for space 
the sweet potato is one of the few plants that is 100 percent 
edible and space travelers could eat the stems and leaves leaving 
no waste 
we dont normally think of the vines but in some parts of the 
world theyre considered a delicacy hall said 
the most popular variety is the jewel a sweet potato that has 
been around for at least 20 years scientists released the 
beauregard a few years ago in louisiana but growers are still 
evaluating it 
north carolina is the nations top producer louisiana is 
second and georgia california and texas vie for third 
with the emphasis on health foods hall said people are 
beginning to see the benefits of eating sweet potatoes which are 
used in soups souffles and ice cream 
i think the interest in health will at least keep the 
consumption level stable and hopefully people will come to see 
these as not only healthy but delightful he said

ben franklin wanted the turkey to be our 
national bird for some reason finding it more respectable than the 
eagle he failed but americans are gobbling up turkey like never 
before 
it now appears as sausage ground up as cutlets or as boned 
roasts cooked into meatloaf cut up in salads tossed with pastas 
or piled onto sandwiches 
thirty years ago 90 percent of all turkey sold in the united 
states was consumed in november and december according to the 
national turkey federation today healthconscious consumers are 
drawn to turkeys low fat content as little as a third that of 
beef and 60 percent of our turkey is eaten during the other 10 
months of the year 
annual consumption has jumped from 10 pounds per person in 1980 
to an estimated 19 pounds this year 
at this time of year however it is the groaning thanksgiving 
table that the turkey most often graces rick rodgers author of 
the turkey cookbook estimates 45 million whole turkeys are 
eaten that one day 
rodgers offers 14 recipes for cooking the whole bird including 
texas turkey with chili powder peppers and onions a bayoustyle 
roast turkey and an italian version with lemon rosemary and 
roasted potatoes 
but he says the juciest crispest turkey is roasted unstuffed 
with herbs and aromatic vegetables placed in the cavities 
november is the busiest month for the us department of 
agricultures meat and poultry hot line with 16000 calls last 
november about half the callers talked to a person the rest heard 
recorded messages on food safety said the hot lines manager 
susan d templin 
the privately operated butterball turkey talkline already has 
had just a deluge of calls this year said marge klindera 
assistant supervisor 
she cites a few reasons for the early calls the popularity of 
turkey troubles getting through when the line was busy last year 
and a calendar butterball is giving away 
in its 10th year the turkey talkline could receive its 
millionth call this season klindera said it is staffed by 44 
nutritionists and home economists 
some recommendations for handling turkey 
to thaw a frozen turkey keep it refrigerated one day for each 
five pounds or place it in its wrapping in a sink and cover with 
cold water change the water every halfhour planning on 30 
minutes per pound 
fresh turkeys should be bought only one to two days before 
cooking whole frozen turkeys will last a year frozen at zero 
degrees 
wash hands utensils counters and sinks that have come in 
contact with raw turkey whenever youre handling a raw product 
you need to be worried about bacteria said templin around the 
holiday pople are preparing larger amounts of food preparing 
ahead putting food out for large groups so theres a lot of areas 
where people can make mistakes 
stuff a turkey just before it is cooked 
do not roast turkey overnight in a lowtemperature oven 
turkey should be cooked at 325 degrees or higher to prevent 
bacteria growth 
remove stuffing right after cooking do not leave a cooked 
turkey at room temperature for more than two hours 
to cook a turkey ahead cook to internal temperature of 180 
degrees carve meat except legs thighs and wings refrigerate 
reheat in 325degree oven 
after dinner cut meat from bones and refrigerate meat up to 
four days or freeze 
 
the usda meat and poulty hot line can be reached at 
8005354555 within washington dc call 4473333 in november 
it operates weekdays and 9 am5 pm est on nov 1718 and 8

exercise is one of those good things that you 
can get too much of and beginning exercisers should realize it 
experts say 
the new demands on their bodies may unmask hidden medical 
problems or break something that had been ok until they suddenly 
put too much stress on it they say 
beginners often dont know how they dont know how much is 
too much or how to progress with it said dr douglas b mckeag 
professor of family practice and coordinator of sports medicine at 
michigan state university 
experts say people should ease into exercise increasing their 
regimen by no more than 10 percent in time or distance each week 
exercise should start with a warmup in an effort not to jump 
start the body and rip a muscle thats unprepared for maximum 
exertion he said if you want to stretch do it slowly and gently 
he said adding that hes more and more convinced that stretching 
is less and less important 
similarly a beginner can exercise too frequently too long or 
too intensely mckeag recommends every other day t a heart rate 
of at least 60 percent of your maximum the maximum is computed 
from the number 220 minus your age for at least 15 minutes a day 
pushing beyond that he said can lead you into injuries that 
strike the area you use the most bicyclists get knee pains 
runners get shin splints tennis players get tennis elbow swimmers 
get sore shoulders they all are listed as overuse injuries 
mckeag said 
the doctor strongly recommends a cooldown a slow easing off 
from your exercise peak 
when major cardiac events occur as a result of exercise it 
happens right after exercise he said quitting cold sends your 
blood pressure bouncing like a yoyo as your body reacts to the 
changes in blood pressure that result 
another problem is that people who didnt know they had heart 
disease may find it when they add the stress of exercise said dr 
william l haskell professor of medicine at stanford university 
school of medicine 
a fair number of middle aged men or older have underlying 
atherosclerosis not evident on a daytoday basis he said 
people who most need to be aware of this have high blood 
pressure high cholesterol tobacco addiction or a family history 
of heart disease he said 
if you are middle aged and dont have those risk factors you 
shouldnt have a problem with an exercise program that starts 
slowly and progresses haskell said 
but he still advises a visit to the doctor before starting an 
exercise program 
a stress test in which a patient commonly exercises on a 
treadmill while medical experts monitor the bodys response is a 
common method to identify people with increased risk but one 
researcher says its overdone 
as a cardiologist thats a financial boondoggle said dr 
paul e thompson of miriam hospital in providence ri 
only a few people die because exercise triggered some underlying 
condition he said 
in a 1982 study of deaths while jogging thompson an associate 
professor of medicine at brown university concluded rhode island 
was averaging one man dead for every 7620 men who jogged per year 
after eliminating the cases in which the joggers knew they had 
heart disease the study found only one death for each 15600 men 
based on those figures the stress test may not be worth the 
300 or so that it costs he said 
on the other hand he said pay attention to a tightness or 
choking feeling in your chest its a sign of heart trouble

a chemical cousin of teflon is showing promise as 
a blood substitute in animals and may one day help stroke patients 
a researcher says 
its chemically pretty inert pretty nontoxic and could 
be stored fairly easily without fear of contamination with virus or 
bacteria or dirt said robert a linsenmeier associate professor 
of biomedical engineering and neurobiology and physiology at 
northwestern university 
the blood substitute is made of a class of chemicals called 
fluorocarbons teflon is also a fluorocarbon a carbonbased 
compound in which most or all hydrogen ions have been replaced by 
fluorine atoms linsenmeier said 
different fluorocarbons have different physical properties he 
said adding that the blood substitute he and his colleagues are 
testing is a thick milky fluid made by alliance pharmaceutical 
corp of san diego 
in stroke patients doctors may one day be able to inject some 
of the artificial blood soon after the stroke and boost the oxygen 
supply to affected brain tissue 
the findings in tests on eight cats by linsenmeier and thomas k 
goldstick professor of chemical engineering and biomedical 
engineering were to be presented this month by their 
coresearcher rod braun at the annual meeting of the american 
institute of chemical engineers in chicago 
now only one form of artificial blood is approved by the food 
and drug administration for use in humans a fluorocarbon emulsion 
called fluosol said gary schaer director of the cardiac 
catheterization laboratory at rushpresbyterianst lukes medical 
center in chicago 
but fluosol is not effective in general transfusions he said 
it is only useful in tiny quantities to keep heart muscle supplied 
with oxygen during cardiac angioplasty 
schaer cautioned that any type of artificial blood still 
undergoing only animal tests is years away from potential use in 
humans

about 40 percent of people probably carry a genetic 
susceptibility to the most common forms of skin cancer no matter 
how fair their skin is researchers reported 
scientists from the university of miami and the veterans 
administration medical center in miami reported in the journal of 
investigative dermatology that there is a genetically distinct 
group inclined to develop skin cancer 
scientists have known for some time that too much sun can cause 
skin cancer but the research team concluded a genetic 
predisposition in tandem with overexposure also may play a role 
dr howard koh associate professor of dermatology and medicine 
and public health at boston university was not familiar with the 
study but noted the importance of such research 
skin cancer is the no 1 cancer in the united states estimated 
at up to 600000 cases a year koh said nonmelanoma skin 
cancer rarely kills a person but its impact on quality of life and 
the morbidity of it is really considerable 
dr j richard taylor and colleagues studied people using 
ultraviolet light exposure and a drug to test the bodys immune 
response neither the drug nor short bursts of ultraviolet light 
exposure were harmful to study participants he said 
study subjects who never had skin cancer developed a rash that 
showed they had the immune system cells needed to fight a 
cancercausing assault none of the volunteers who previously had 
cancer developed the rash taylor said

kuwait airways soon plans to resume service into 
the united states as it expands symbolic efforts to keep flying 
even though occupying iraqis have pirated most of the oilrich 
emirates jet fleet 
its a minioperation said gerard tateossian manager of 
the governmentowned airlines us offices we can still run our 
airline and have the kuwaiti flag flying all over the world 
after iraqi troops invaded kuwait on aug 2 they seized the 
airport in kuwait city along with 15 planes from the fleet of 23 
once held by kuwait airways tateossian said the eight jets still 
in the fleet are the ones that happened to be out of the country 
fifteen of them have been looted by aggressors taken away to 
baghdad tateossian said there is no place else they can go 
we have indications that there is nothing at the kuwait airport 
kuwait airways announced through newspaper advertisements 
wednesday that it soon would resume service to new york one of its 
key foreign destinations 
until were able to welcome you to kuwait welcome aboard 
the ad states it calls the new service a symbol of the 
perseverance of kuwait 
we resumed operations already out of cairo to the gulf on the 
18th of october tateossian said in a telephone interview we 
will be resuming out of the united states sometime at the end of 
this month or the beginning of december 
the new york flights will include twiceweekly trips from 
kennedy airport to london bahrain and bombay he said there will 
be an additional flight leaving once a week that goes from kennedy 
to london cairo bahrain and bombay 
the flights will be handled by crews who were with the planes 
that escaped the invasion as well as some workers who got out on 
their own tateossian said 
kuwait airways said its ticketing offices in washington 
houston chicago los angeles and toronto remain open those cities 
were never destinations 
the staterun carrier is now an airline without a country as 
its corporate offices are set up in cairo and its hub is now 
bahrain 
previous service into various african european and asian 
destinations has not been restored 
kuwait airways hopes it can make its skeletal service turn a 
profit but the us manager said the most important consideration 
is to just show that it can still fly 
the first operations were up to 54 percent occupancy

twa chairman carl icahn usx corps largest 
shareholder is threatening to seek seats on the giant steel and 
energy companys board if it ignores his latest call for 
restructuring 
in a letter to usx corp chairman charles corry icahn praised 
plans announced last month to transfer its steel operations into a 
separate company those plans could result in a sale of the steel 
division the biggest steelmaker in the country 
but icahn called on usx to distribute the proceeds from the sale 
of the steel business to shareholders as a special dividend 
my usx stock is not for sale and i will not even consider 
selling it until usx supports a meaningful restructuring plan that 
benefits all shareholders icahn said in his letter 
the letter dated nov 13 was disclosed wednesday in an icahn 
filing with the securities and exchange commission in washington 
a spokesman for usx don herring said the company had no 
comment on the matter 
usx stock closed at 3212 up 37 cents at the end of trading 
wednesday 
icahn a takeover strategist who runs trans world airlines has 
been a thorn in the side of usx management for years he had been 
laying low since last may when his proposal to spin off most of 
the usx steel business in the form of a shareholder dividend was 
rejected by other stockholders 
icahn has said he considers steel a drain on usxs marathon oil 
co and texas oil and gas co 
icahn who controls 133 percent of usxs common stock said he 
was creating an independent committee to assist all stockholders 
of the company in having meaningful input on issues such as 
separating the steel and energy businesses dividend policy and 
corporate governance 
the committee consisting of law government and business 
professors at harvard and stanford universities and the university 
of chicago would seek election to the board of directors at the 
1991 annual meeting unless the usx board adopts a meaningful 
restructuring plan and corporate governance changes according to 
icahns fivepage letter to corry 
icahn also said the committee would seek a shareholders list 
and begin canvassing usx shareholders as soon as practical about 
its proposals which include the possible sale of all or part of 
its energy operations and eliminating the shareholder rights plan 
or poison pill defense against possible takeovers

a federal judge gave john a mulheren jr a 
366day prison term and a 168 million fine for stock 
manipulation saying the former friend of famous wall street felon 
ivan boesky deserved incarceration 
anyone who tampers with the integrity of the stock market will 
go to prison judge miriam cedarbaum decreed wednesday in 
pronouncing sentence on mulheren a flamboyant 41yearold 
speculator convicted with boeskys help 
when asked for his reaction to the sentence mulheren responded 
in the same easygoing manner with which he conducted himself 
during his trial nobody likes to go to jail right 
mulherens prosecution received widespread attention because it 
featured boeskys first public testimony in wall streets insider 
trading scandals he was freed pending appeal of the charges 
he was the only person implicated by boesky the exspeculator 
whose admissions led to several prominent indictments to go to 
trial rather than strike a plea agreement 
a jury in july found mulheren guilty of charges he helped boesky 
drive up the price of gulf amp western inc stock in 1985 he faced a 
maximum of 20 years in prison 
if his conviction is upheld it is unlikely mulheren will serve 
the entire sentence because he will be eligible for parole after 
serving four months cedarbaum also gave mulheren credit for time 
served in 1988 in connection with an alleged plot to shoot boesky 
mulherens attorney thomas puccio said he believed mulheren 
was in federal custody for about two months for that incident 
which later was settled with mulheren agreeing to three years of 
probation 
mulheren did not address the court before sentencing he relied 
on statements by puccio who asked for leniency because mulheren 
suffered from manic depression and because of his many charitable 
acts 
the most we have here is someone who momentarily strayed and 
committed one act on one day against a lifetime of honesty and 
respectability puccio said 
prosecutors had charged that mulheren bought 75000 gulf amp 
western shares at boeskys behest driving the stock to 45 a 
share the price at which boesky wanted to sell about 35 million 
shares back to the company 
cedarbaum said the fine of 168 million represented the losses 
sustained by investors who bought gulf amp western stock during the 
time of the manipulation 
boesky agreed in november 1986 to plead guilty to one count of 
lying to federal investigators and pay 100 million in fines he 
was released from federal custody in april after serving two years 
of a threeyear term 
the high point of the trial came when boesky was called as a 
prosecution witness against mulheren his former business associate 
and friend boesky admitted in testimony that he traded suitcases 
stuffed with cash for confidential information about imminent 
takeovers 
mulheren a laidback multimillionaire who often flew by 
helicopter to his trial flouted convention in court as he had in 
his wall street career during testimony mulheren wore a tennis 
shirt blue jeans and boat shoes 
at sentencing mulheren also dressed casually in an opennecked 
pink shirt and khaki pants 
in 1988 after learning boesky had implicated him mulheren was 
arrested leaving his rumson nj mansion carrying a loaded 
assault rifle and army fatigues police said he planned to shoot 
boesky 
state authorities in new jersey last year dropped weapons 
possession charges against mulheren as a part of the settlement 
that included probation mulherens lawyers blamed the incident on 
his failure to take lithium prescribed to treat manic depression 
some criminal charges against mulheren remain because the jury 
was unable to reach a verdict on 26 additional counts of securities

us automakers reported a 24 percent rise in 
the number of north americanmade cars and trucks sold in early 
november despite a big decline posted by chrysler corp 
within hours wednesday of chrysler reporting a 213 percent 
decline in its vehicle sales during the period the struggling 
automaker issued a new incentive package including cash rebates on 
all of its minivans its the second time in history thats been 
done 
chryslers car sales fell 91 percent while sales of its trucks 
including the companys minivan line plummeted 33 percent 
general motors corp and ford motor co meanwhile said their 
car and truck sales during the nov 110 period rose 74 percent 
and 47 percent respectively compared with the same time last 
year 
combined the big three and the seven japanese companies selling 
cars and trucks made in north america said their average daily 
sales rate rose to 26817 vehicles during the period this year 
compared with a rate of 26194 a day in early november last year 
car sales jumped 8 percent over a relatively weak period last 
year but truck sales dropped 64 percent mainly because of the 
sag in chrysler sales 
chrysler spokesman tom jakobowski said wednesday the truck sales 
declines were noted acrosstheboard with no one particular 
vehicle suffering a significantly larger slump than others 
shortly after reporting its car and truck sales chrysler issued 
a new incentive program that included rebates on standardwheelbase 
minivans chrysler has commanded a lions share of the minivan 
market ever since it introduced its popular vehicles in late 1983 
but recently as the number of companies marketing minivans in 
the united states has grown chryslers share of the market has 
shrunk nonetheless the company still controls more than 45 
percent of the market 
chrysler said it would offer a 1000 discount on 1989 and 1990 
models of its popular minivans between now and dec 16 previously 
the company offered 500 cash rebates on extralength minivans 
that incentive also was boosted to 1000 
jakobowski said as much as 40 percent of the minivans sold 
during the earlynovember period were 1989 or 1990 models chrysler 
shut down its two minivan assembly plants for a month apiece to 
retool for 1991 models which cut supplies of the newly redesigned 
models 
also on wednesday chrysler boosted rebates on its jeep line of 
sportutility vehicles and some of its jeep and dodge pickup 
trucks 
the only other time chrysler has offered a rebate on its 
minivans which were introduced in late 1983 was during a sixweek 
period beginning in middecember last year sales of the popular 
light trucks soared during the rebate period but plummeted when 
the rebates expired 
the earlynovember sales period last year was one of the weakest 
of 1989 many consumers who had planned to buy cars in the fourth 
quarter of last year pushed up their purchases to the third quarter 
to take advantage of incentives and avoid price increases due with 
the 1990 models 
incentives still are in effect but they dont have the drawing 
power they once had 
so far this year car and truck sales by the 10 companies have 
dropped 36 percent compared with last year with car sales down 
38 percent and truck sales 33 percent

gilbert hyatt the engineer who was granted a 
patent last summer for the computer microprocessor after a 20year 
battle says hes done it again 
hyatt announced wednesday at the comdex computer show that he 
recently received a patent for a technology that triples the speed 
of one of the most widely used types of computer chips 
hyatt said his modification of dynamic random access memory 
chips or dram eliminates unnecessary operations in the chips to 
achieve the greater speed 
drams are among the most common types of computer chips used in 
products ranging from personal computers to printers to some home 
electronics equipment 
they temporarily store bits of data that are needed to perform 
various operations 
by speeding them up computers could perform calculations more 
quickly thats because the speed of microprocessors the 
brains of personal computers has outpaced the ability of drams 
to feed them data 
hyatt said he plans to license the technology to the computer 
industry much like he is seeking licenses for his 1968 invention 
of the microprocessor 
one industry analyst millard phelps of the san francisco 
brokerage hambrecht amp quist said hyatts latest invention could be 
a major advance provided his chips dont have too many drawbacks 
it sure makes you wonder what is the tradeoff phelps said 
hyatt however said he achieved the speedup without sacrificing 
any other characteristics of the chips he said he uses 
offtheshelf drams in his technique 
hyatt said he plans to use any royalties he receives from his 
two patents to help other small inventors he said small inventors 
tend to get trampled by major companies and overlooked by the 
government 
i hope to do my part in helping the little guy from what i 
learned in my 20year fight he said 
hyatt of la palma calif fought with the us patent office 
and major computer chip makers until he was granted his 
microprocessor patent in july 
the patent award called into question the computer industrys 
official history which says the microprocessor was invented by 
several intel corp scientists 
hyatt declined to comment on the amount of royalties he was 
seeking on the patent beyond calling them significant 
industry analysts estimate he could get several million dollars a 
year from major microprocessor makers 
hyatt has said that he sought his patent more to set history 
straight than for riches he said he has earned a living by 
consulting to the aerospace industry while continuing to work on 
inventions in his home lab and seeking the patents 
despite his long ordeal with the microprocessor hyatt supports 
the cumbersome us patentgranting system 
its to the credit of the patent system that eventually right 
prevails he said

pan am corp finalized its deal to sell 
important transatlantic routes to ual corp in a 400 million 
package that will give united airlines a strong presence flying 
across two oceans 
now united might run into troubles with the british bureaucracy 
as it seeks to keep flying the old pan am routes into heathrow 
airport the most desirable destination in london some airline 
analysts believe the british will insist that united fly into 
gatwick airport instead 
the teamsters union at pan am had also voiced objections to the 
deal saying the struggling carrier was not getting enough cash for 
the london routes but pan am said the deal also involved a 
marketing agreement through which the rival airlines will 
coordinate some flights and attempt to feed passengers to one 
another 
the two carriers signed the final papers on the deal late 
wednesday night the deadline for its completion pan am spokesman 
jeff kriendler said the airlines did immediately release details 
of pact as it was announced early today 
the agreement was put in question over the weekend when it was 
announced that twa had proposed merging with pan am if the 
arrangement with united fell through if the papers hadnt been 
signed by wednesday the united deal could have been terminated and 
twas offer might have come into play 
twa chairman carl icahn offered pan am securities with a face 
value of 300 million and 150 million in cash if it didnt sell 
the routes to uniteds parent ual corp 
completing the deal marks a major expansion by ual united 
bought pan ams prized pacific routes five years ago for 750 
million and has since become a key airline in that part of the 
world 
the deal originally announced late last month provides for ual 
to acquire pan ams uslondon routes except for those from miami 
and detroit 
it also provides for ual to buy gates hangar and office space 
at san francisco and washingtons dulles international airport two 
boeing 747 jumbo jets and spare parts 
also wednesday federal transportation officials gave final 
approval to uniteds planned new routes between chicago and tokyo 
the department of transportation approved the routes over the 
objections of american airlines which had sought to offer the 
service 
pan am has said it will concentrate on one major european hub 
frankfurt as well as strengthen schedules to other european 
cities including oslo zagreb hamburg amsterdam and nuremberg 
in addition pan am has said it will increase its miami presence 
by adding longhaul flights from that city to latin america 
the agreement with ual also includes reciprocal participation in 
each others frequent flier programs and coordination of their 
schedules at miami as well as to central and south america from 
the west coast

general motors corp is in a dispute with the 
us treasury department over whether its canadianbuilt geo 
tracker sportutility vehicle or the geo metro subcompact car 
should be subject to tariffs 
at issue is whether the tracker or metro built at a joint 
gmsuzuki motor co ltd plant in ingersoll ontario have more 
than 50 percent of their value attributable to us or canadian 
labor 
if the vehicles comply and have more than 50 percent north 
american content they enter the united states without tariffs 
most of the engines and transmissions for gms geo line of small 
vehicles come from japan 
the treasury department said the tracker and metro dont comply 
with the north american content rule gm disagrees saying the 
content level should include the costs of borrowing money for the 
factory 
its very real and in our case it was borrowed from a 
variety of institutions in canada and in the us said james 
cameron a spokesman for the cami automotive inc joint 
manufacturing plant in ingersoll 
if the tracker is classified as having less than 50 percent 
north american content it would be subject to a 25 percent truck 
tariff and the metro could be hit with a 25 percent car tariff 
if the levies were applied it could cost gm 75 million for the 
29000 trackers and 27000 metros it brought into the united states 
from canada during the 1990 model year according to john simpson 
a deputy assistant secretary for the treasury department 
other automakers vehicles made in ontario contain have more 
than 50 percent north american content they include the civic made 
by honda motor co ltd in allison the corolla made by toyota 
motor corp in cambridge the ford crown victoria and mercury grand 
marquis made by ford motor co in st thomas and the dodge monaco 
and eagle premier made by chrysler corp in bramalea

the newest gadgets that box sort tape and 
buffer are on display at a packaging industry trade show that looks 
grassgreen in its support of sound environmental policies 
its the environmental revolution said craig todd district 
manager of better packages everybodys gotten on the 
bandwagon 
better packages isnt offering a new product at the show but is 
exhibiting new packaging for its old products 
the shelton conn companys tape machines which use glue 
rather than adhesives which dont decompose just happen to be 
the right thing at the right time todd said 
more than 55000 people were on hand wednesday for the packaging 
industrys pack expo which ends friday at mccormick place 
dozens of this years 900 exhibitors included environmentally 
sensible products which ran from mailing envelopes made of 
recycled materials to packaging peanuts made nearly entirely of 
cornstarch 
the new peanuts manufactured by american excelsior co of 
arlington texas will give the environmentally conscious consumer 
an alternative to the standard polystyrene packaging peanut the 
company said 
the product called ecofoam is more than 95 percent 
cornstarch and the rest is a watersoluble organic polymer said 
robert asselin of national starch and chemical co of bridgewater 
nj it handles the peanuts production for american excelsior 
the product dissolves in water and is safe enough to eat said 
asselin who did just that while chatting with a reporter 
american excelsior will keep making polystyrene peanuts said 
company vice president ken starrett 
weve serviced this market for about 30 years or more said 
starrett were not competing with ourselves and we dont see a 
conflict by making both products ecofoam is still the newcomer to 
the market 
some companies said thir customers arent fully converted to 
the idea that environmentally sound is best 
theyll buy it if the cost is the same and the qualitys the 
same but if the price is higher or the qualitys affected forget 
it said peter dauphinais whose company polyair corp 
introduced ecolite mailing envelopes this year 
the envelopes are made from 100 percent recycled paper and 
plastic and while they cost the same as nonrecycled theyre less 
strong said dauphinais sales man for the toronto company 
cantech industries inc of johnson city tenn introduced a 
new unbleached masking tape at the show 
the new tape is free of caustic chemicals used in other tape 
manufacture but is not quite as white as its bleached counterpart 
said cantechs jim petruzzi 
petruzzi said manufacturers tend to have a natural inclination 
toward packaging materials which are the newest and whiteest of 
whites a tendency that dies hard 
you spend your whole life on making things look good then 
environmental issues come up said petruzzi not that theyre 
not good issues

book publisher simon amp schuster said today it 
will not release american psycho a violent new novel by 
critically acclaimed author bret easton ellis 
chairman richard e snyder released a statement saying the book 
which was scheduled to be shipped to stores next month would not 
handle be handled by simon amp schuster ellis publicist said the 
decision smacks of censorship 
american psycho is not a book that simon amp schuster is 
willing to publish even though mr ellis is a serious author whose 
work simon amp schuster has previously published snyder said 
ellis 26 is the author of the critically praised novel less 
than zero which depicts a morally decadent lifestyle among 
children of upperincome families in los angeles it was made into 
a movie in 1987 
the statement offered no further explanation for the books 
cancellation but snyder told the washington post in my opinion 
there was an incorrect decision by editors who bought the book 
and approved its publication 
american psycho the story of a young successful wall 
street businessman who cant stop killing people was criticized 
for its vivid descriptions of violence against women 
ellis publicist amanda urban said refusing to publish a 
book at this 11th hour without explanation raises the question 
whether there was a form of censorship going on here 
what is involved here is a giant corporation responding to 
prepublication controversy and strongarming its publishing 
division into abandoning its own tradition of fearless 
publication urban said 
snyder denied he was pressured into canceling the book by the 
publishing houses parent company paramount communications inc 
it was i who decided we should not put our name on this book 
its a matter of taste snyder told the washington post he said 
paramount agreed with his decision 
through the press i became aware of this book and then aware 
of its contents snyder said and it was i who decided we 
should not put our name on this book its a matter of taste 
urban said other publishers have expressed interest in the book 
she declined to give names while negotiating she said ellis does 
not have to give back his advance which todays wall street 
journal put at 300000 
snyder said martin davis chairman of the publishing houses 
parent company paramount communications inc agreed with the 
decision 
ellis was quoted by the washington post as conceding that some 
scenes in his novel are appalling but added that some magazine 
accounts of it verged on the hysterical and gave a false sense of 
what the book is about the violence is there because the 
character is crazy he said 
the book is 400 pages long and there are less than 40 pages 
with the type of mayhem they quote ellis said

washington states automobilelemon law designed 
to protect consumers who purchase defective new motor vehicles was 
upheld today by a unanimous state supreme court 
the law had been challenged by the ford motor co which 
contended it violates the equal protection and due process 
provisions of the state and us constitutions 
the states interest in protecting consumers in the purchase 
of motor vehicles under the motor vehicles warranties law outweighs 
the due process considerations justice charles smith wrote for 
the court 
the case stemmed from fords appeal to the king county superior 
court of a new motor vehicle arbitration board ruling in favor of 
gary barrett 
barrett bought a ford thunderbird from mossy ford in bellevue in 
september 1985 he went to the arbitration board after the dealer 
was unable to repair a steering problem that caused the vehicle to 
pull to the left 
the board ordered ford to buy the vehicle back from barrett 
ford conceded that the steering defect constituted a serious 
safety defect 
but the automaker appealed asking that barretts claim be 
denied on merits and contending the requirement that it repurchase 
the vehicle was unconstitutional 
superior court judge patricia aitken disagreed she ordered ford 
to pay barrett 7125 representing the repurchase cost less offset 
for use 7000 for fords failure to provide free use of a 
comparable loaner vehicle pending resolution of the appeal and 
1750 for attorneys fees 
in its appeal of tht decision to the states high court ford 
contended that requiring it to pay attorney fees and a 
loanervehicle fee constituted the singling out of a class of 
litigants and subjecting them to onerous penalties as a condition 
of seeking redress within the court system 
ford also complained that if had prevailed in its superior court 
appeal barrett could not have been forced to pay attorney fees 
the company said that represented denial of equal protection under 
the law for ford and discouraged the filing of appeals 
smith noted however that the law designates two classes 
manufacturers and consumers and that the consumer class is not 
held liable for fees incurred in an appeal 
smith held that the separation of classes was rational and he 
brushed aside fords argument that the law might discourage all 
appeals by manufacturers 
he said ford had not effectively demonstrated that the law was 
not rationally related to its purpose 
equal protection does not require that legislative efforts be 
perfect smith wrote adding the states interest in consumer 
protection outweighs any deterrent effect on manufacturers

the head of eastern airlines predicted today 
that the embattled carrier would strengthen soon and he denounced 
the creditors who sought to choke off its lifegiving supply of 
cash in a bankruptcycourt brawl 
their actions in public and in the media are nothing short of 
reckless and shameful they have set back our recovery efforts 
eastern trustee martin r shugrue jr told a news conference a day 
after he convinced a bankruptcy judge to release more money from a 
2736 million escrow fund to keep eastern operating 
shugrue also said he believed that eastern one of the countrys 
oldest biggest and most troubled airlines will stay on the path 
to profitability and will continue to maintain the support of the 
court 
the airlines creditors wanted us bankruptcy judge burton r 
lifland to deny eastern any more money force it to close and 
auction off whatever assets remain to help pay its enormous debts 
analysts say eastern has a total accumulated debt of some 25 
billion 
at a packed hearing that lasted nearly nine hours wednesday 
night the creditors and eastern officials sparred over whether the 
airline could survive especially in view of the nations economic 
downturn and a dramatic rise in fuel prices caused by the 
3monthold persian gulf crisis 
burton finally ruled eastern could have 15 million immediately 
half of what it requested through late december the judge said 
hed release another 15 million if easterns projections were on 
track as of early december 
burton said he was making a close call with his ruling he 
also said eastern could revise performance estimates to account for 
any harm that comes from news stories written about creditor 
attempts to liquidate the airline 
theres a great sense of relief eastern spokesman jim 
ashlock said wednesday night after a judge approved the lifesaving 
infusion this was the big one 
eastern was taking steps today to assure its 18000 employees 
that they would still be flying at least for now 
the brush with near death was the latest in a history of trauma 
at eastern which has been operating under bankruptcy court 
protection since march 1989 when most employees struck in a bitter 
dispute with management over concessions to save money eastern 
hired strike replacements and is a much smaller airline now but it 
is still suffering staggering losses of about 1 million a day 
in addition to the 30 million shugrue requested for december 
he also said during the hearing that the airline probably will need 
another 40 million in late december and an additional 10 million 
in january before it can turn the corner and halt losses that have 
come to about 1 million daily 
shugrue said eastern will be able to repay the fund with even 
more cash by february but the unsecured creditors committee said 
it put no faith in his plans for resurrecting the carrier 
the creditors say easterns plans are based on an assumption 
that fuel prices will drop as well as shugrues contention that he 
will be able to take business away from his more healthy 
competitors through a program that offers firstclass service at 
coach class rates 
the creditors said fuel costs are likely to keep rising but the 
judge faulted them for making a court filing on tuesday that 
included news stories about a dramatic rise in oil prices late last 
week the creditors left out subsequent news stories that showed 
oil falling sharply over the next couple of days 
eastern even pointed out that one of the creditors expert 
witnesses has even been quoted in at least two recent news stories 
as saying oil prices are likely to fall 
your speculation and your arguments about prices may be no 
better than theirs the judge told lawyers for the creditors who 
include banks airplane companies and labor unions 
the creditors said easterns competitors will find ways to 
compete with the firstclass program and they are particularly 
motivated to do so as the airline industry endures hard times amid 
high fuel prices and a sluggish economy 
shugrue said eastern has failed to meet his previous projections 
for business improvements because of the unpredictable downturn in 
the us economy and iraqs invasion of kuwait in august 
alan s boyd chairman of the creditors committee and chairman 
of airplanemaker airbus industrie holdings of north america 
stopped short of saying the judges ruling will delay the 
inevitable death of eastern 
how this process will work out god only knows boyd said 
speaking to reporters outside the courthouse 
the judge said in issuing his ruling that shugrue had shown 
reasonable business judgment in asking for the additional money 
im not sure the creditors committee has exercised business 
judgment superior to that of the trustee lifland said 
the hearing coincided with the release of easterns earnings 
statement for the third quarter of 1990 which showed the airline 
lost 2528 million bringing its total loss for the year to 4249 
million

insurance companies and not the polluters 
they insure must pay the costs of governmentordered toxic waste 
cleanups the state supreme court ruled today 
the unanimous decision was a major victory for corporate 
policyholders over insurers who argued cleanup costs were excluded 
from coverage a lawyer for the manufacturer whose waste dump sites 
were at issue in the case said the ruling would also protect the 
public 
by providing insurance coverage for a companys own cleanup 
costs in response to government orders the ruling should encourage 
a quicker cleanup and a less costly one and the likelihood of a 
more complete one said david steuber an attorney for fmc corp 
otherwise he said companies might wait until government 
agencies performed the cleanup and sued them for the costs 
fmc a chicagobased chemical and weapons company had been sued 
by federal and local agencies for allegedly polluting the land and 
water at 79 toxic waste sites in at least 22 states 
the costs of those projects have been estimated at 250 million 
or more insurance company lawyers in the case have said more than 
2 billion in similar costs was at stake in 17 pending toxic 
cleanup cases in california 
the ruling resolved a split in lower state courts over whether a 
polluter or the insurers who provide coverage for property damage 
should pay for the costs of removing hazardous substances from the 
environment 
standard insurance policies require insurers to cover all costs 
that the policyholder shall become legally obligated to pay as 
damages because of property damage 
fmcs insurers argued the policies did not cover costs of 
cleaning up pollution in response to government orders issued under 
environmental laws or costs of repaying the government for its own 
expenses the insurers said damages referred only to money 
awarded for injuries in a jury trial and not to remedial costs 
paid under government order 
the supreme court disagreed chief justice malcolm lucas wrote 
that the plain and ordinary meanings of damages and other 
words in the policies covered all types of expenses incurred in 
response to government orders to repair property damage caused by 
toxic discharges 
rejecting a key argument of the insurers lucas said the fact 
that fmc was a large sophisticated company did not affect the 
usual principle that unclear language in an insurance policy must 
be interpreted against the insurer who drafted it and in favor of 
coverage

us trade representative carla hills 
warned on thursday that a failure of world trade talks would 
increase tensions among trading partners and could even spill over 
into foreign policy areas 
we would be headed into a period of much greater friction 
she said shortly after her arrival in brussels for a series of 
talks with european community officials 
she said it would be very difficult to maintain 
international cooperation on issues ranging from the environment 
to the persian gulf crisis if you are at each others throats 
over trade issues 
mrs hills will join us secretary of state james a baker iii 
and other american officials on friday in a fresh attempt to break 
an impasse with the european community over proposals to reduce 
agricultural subsidies 
weve got a stalemate and weve got a problem she said 
earlier frans andriessen the communitys top trade official 
said the trading blocs proposal to trim farm subsidies on major 
crops by 30 percent was negotiable 
we never said gentlemen this is the communitys proposal 
take it or leave it we want to negotiate the ec is ready to take 
these negotiations to a successful result andriessen told 
reporters 
the offer falls far short of the subsidy cuts being sought by 
the ecs key trade partners notably the united states and has 
raised questions about whether the uruguay round of world trade 
talks can be completed in early december as scheduled 
andriessen spoke after european community trade ministers 
discussed the trade talks involving 105 nations under the auspices 
of the general agreement on tariffs and trade the negotiations 
which began in 1986 in punta del este uruguay are designed to 
overhaul the world trading system 
the ec wants a 30 percent cut in farm subsidies over 10 years 
while the united states and other farmexporting nations want to 
slash payments by 75 percent 
washington also wants to reduce agricultural export subsidies by 
90 percent over a decade while the ec has not addressed export 
subsidies 
ec officials sought to play down the dispute on farm subsidies 
pointing out there are also disagreements in the 14 other areas 
under negotiation in the talks 
our commitment is to negotiate seriously what is at stake 
economically and politically is quite a lot said renato 
ruggiero the italian trade minister and the meetings chairman 
otto schlecht germanys deputy trade minister said a 
successful end of the gatt round is extremely important to 
safeguard an open world trading system

president bush proclaimed a new era for 
clean air today as he signed farreaching legislation placing new 
curbs on air pollution from automobiles factories and businesses 
every american expects and deserves to breathe clean air 
bush said signing the clean air act of 1990 
he called the measure the centerpiece of our environmental 
agenda and the most significant air pollution legislation in 
our nations history 
bush signed the measure at an east room ceremony standing with 
key lawmakers involved in the long and contentious fight over the 
measure 
this is a true red letter day for all americans bush 
declared we begin a new era for clean air 
no american should have to drive out of town to have to 
breathe clean air every city in america should have clean air and 
with this legislation i firmly believe we will he said 
mission defined mission accomplished he added 
the bill 748 pages long will affect virtually every american 
it was approved by congress easily last month belying 16 months of 
debate and long hours of behindthescenes negotiations on a myriad 
of provisions 
in advance of todays billsigning environmental groups were 
hailing the bills enactment the clean air act of 1990 is like a 
breath of fresh air after a 10year smog alert said sierra club 
president susan merrow 
the law will require new pollution controls for automobiles 
electric utilities factories and thousands of businesses it 
eventually is expected to cost the economy as much as 25 billion a 
year according to white house estimates 
the legislation aims to cut acid rain pollutants by half 
sharply reduce urban smog and eliminate most of the toxic chemical 
emissions from industrial plants by the turn of the century 
many environmentalists although highly critical of the 
president on an array of issues from wetland protection to global 
warming acknowledge the bill would have had little chance of 
passage without bushs support 
federal air pollution controls have not been changed since 1977 
over the last 10 years attempts to impose new requirements 
repeatedly were stymied by strong opposition from various economic 
and regional interests and the reagan administration 
bush changed much of that by proposing in july 1989 a broad 
rewrite of the federal clean air laws that set the stage for the 
congressional debate 
the act approved by the senate 8910 and the house 40125 
will require automakers to install tougher emission controls and 
service stations to sell cleanerburning gasoline blends force 
thousands of businesses and factories to install new equipment to 
capture smogcausing pollutants and toxic chemicals and require 
coalburning power plants to cut in half sulfur dioxide emissions 
which cause acid rain 
some of the new requirements will begin to be phased in within a 
few years although most will not be fully in place until the end 
of the decade some cities with the worst smog problems have as 
long as 15 to 20 years to meet federal air requirements 
the signing of the historic bill is expected to do little to 
help bush mend fences with an environmental community that has 
become increasingly critical of the president 
bush has yet to prove hes an environmentalist said mike 
clark president of friends of the earth 
the clean air bill is his one and only significant 
environmental achievement and he certainly is not entitled to take 
sole credit for it added george frampton president of the 
wilderness society 
environmentalists have been critical of bush for not moving more 
aggressively to deal with global warming an issue the president 
maintains steadfastly has not had a thorough scientific 
examination 
while many industrial nations have established goals for 
reducing global warming pollutants primarily carbon dioxide from 
the burning of fossil fuels the administration has refused to 
make any specific commitments 
environmentalists point to other issues on which they say the 
administrations policies have been a disappointment 
they cite the presidents strong support for opening the arctic 
national wildlife refuge in alaska to oil exploration slow 
progress in developing a formal policy to protect wetlands and 
hints of wanting to reexamine the endangered species act to take 
economic issues more heavily into account 
last summer bush expressed irritation with environmentalists 
and declared that their grading system is absolutely 
absurd 
william reilly a longtime conservationist and head of the 
environmental protection agency staunchly defends bushs 
environmental record and suggested the critics often judge bush 
against an unfair standard of perfection

soybeans futures prices staged a moderate 
comeback thursday on the chicago board of trade amid rumors of new 
export business grains were mostly lower 
soybean prices firmed as speculation grew that a useuropean 
food aid package to the soviet union would come out of president 
bushs upcoming trip to europe 
soybeans futures were boosted later in the day after rumors 
began circulating that the united states was preparing to offer 
subsidized soybean meal to pakistan said dan cekander an analyst 
with rodman amp renshaw inc 
but the gains probably will be only shortterm cekander said 
weve had so many rumors of aid and they never pan out he 
said i expect to see further liquidation because the market 
wants to see business not hear rumors 
soybeans continued to face pressure from a government report 
issued last week that found larger stocks of the crop than had been 
expected 
followthrough selling in wheat and corn came from wednesdays 
sharp losses little export activity and bountiful crops were 
blamed for another session of significant losses 
at the close wheat futures were 8 cents to 4 cents lower with 
the contract for delivery in december at 247 a bushel corn 
futures were 2 cents to cent lower with december at 222 a 
bushel oats were 1 cents to 2 cents higher with december at 
109 a bushel soybeans were 4 cents to cent higher with 
november at 558 a bushel

commerce secretary robert mosbacher pledged 
thursday to enforce tariffs in an existing trade agreement that 
helps americans compete with canadian softwood lumber producers 
events in canada suggest that the government of canada may be 
under increasing pressure to renegotiate or eliminate the 
4yearold memo of understanding between the two countries 
mosbacher said 
we are firmly committed and will take any action necessary 
and appropriate to enforce the terms of the agreement he said in 
a letter thursday to rep ron wyden dore chairman of the house 
small business subcommittee on regulation energy and business 
opportunity 
canada agreed in 1986 to impose a 15 percent surtax on lumber 
exports to the united states to help offset subsidies canadian 
producers receive from their government canada supplied about 28 
percent of the softwood lumber consumed in the united states last 
year worth nearly 28 billion 
but northwest lawmakers are afraid the export duties will be 
weakened allowing canadians to undercut prices for us softwood 
lumber and eventually costing jobs 
mosbacher said the 1986 agreement has become a political 
target in canada because of saw mill closures a stronger 
canadian dollar and fear of a market downturn 
its not a matter of if its a matter of when said steve 
jenning staff director of wydens subcommittees their 
political advisers are urging their people in ontario to take 
action prior to the return of congress in january 
but mosbacher said in the letter that while canadas economic 
problems have an impact on its lumber industry they dont affect 
the subsidies the agreement offsets

eastern airlines got a cash infusion that should 
keep it alive for a few weeks but the struggling carrier faces 
another test next month when it tries to persuade a bankruptcy 
judge to hand out more money 
easterns fight for survival is made even tougher by wounds 
suffered in the boisterous battle with creditors who want the 
airline shut so its assets can be sold off industry analysts said 
thursday 
courtappointed trustee martin r shugrue jr agreed easterns 
prospects for recovery had been harmed by a reckless and 
shameful attack from the unsecured creditors 
they told us bankruptcy judge burton r lifland that eastern 
has no chance of regaining financial strength which has withered 
relentlessly since a strike and bankruptcy filing in march 1989 
threw the airlines future into doubt 
but shugrue said eastern has a reasonable hope of growing 
stronger through its marketing of firstclass seats at coachclass 
prices despite a likely loss of overall bookings following 
widespread publicity of the creditors claims that eastern was 
dying 
america loves an underdog and we are an underdog shugrue 
told a news conference thursday we are the underdog in this 
indutry 
shugrue persuaded the judge during a hearing wednesday night to 
keep eastern flying for now with an immediate withdrawal of 15 
million from an escrow account that the creditors wanted to 
preserve on thursday shugrue said he had the courts support 
even though lifland would not give eastern the entire 30 million 
it had sought 
the judge said he wants to see how well eastern is doing early 
next month before it can tap into the account for another 15 
million 
shugrue predicted thursday that eastern will be able to show 
enough of an improvement to get the money but soon hes going to 
have to ask for more with an anticipated request for 40 million 
coming in late december to be followed by a request for 10 million 
in early january 
after that eastern thinks it can turn the corner toward 
profitability even though the creditors fear the airline is 
throwing good money after bad 
analysts also have their doubts about easterns future 
raymond e neidl at dillon read amp co inc said eastern might 
encounter troubles just showing the judge it is doing well enough 
to get the next 15 million 
neidl said that when the judge gave eastern some but not all of 
the money shugrue wanted wednesday he may have sent a signal that 
the airline should start selling what it can before the inevitable 
occurs 
it could be kind of a push saying maybe its time to sell 
the assets while youre a going concern neidl said an active 
business can generally expect to get a better price for assets than 
a business forced to liquidate 
creditors said they stood by their view that eastern cannot 
become a viable standalone airline at a time when fuel prices 
seem out of control and the united states is displaying symptoms of 
a recession 
the unsecured creditors who include banks airplane companies 
and labor unions said they had not yet plotted their next move 
however 
we have some ideas but the committee will be meeting to talk 
about that attorney joel b zweibel said thursday so at the 
moment there isnt any public statement on their intentions 
miamibased eastern meanwhile was assuring its 18000 workers 
they are still in business while checking with travel agents to see 
how much damage the airline had incurred 
one of the problems we have to address is we did lose a 
significant amount of business said eastern spokesman jim 
ashlock we have to regain now that public confidence its very 
difficult to get back cancellations because that usually means 
theyve booked somewhere else 
some travel agents say they are advising people against booking 
flights on eastern others are suggesting that travelers use their 
credit cards for tickets so if eastern goes under the customers 
can refuse to pay the credit card company 
ej breen spokesman for the eastern pilots union said the 
fatal damage has been done because of the likelihood travel agents 
will book away from eastern 
i really and truly think that this whole process has put the 
final nail in the coffin breen said

lawyers representing most of the defendants in 
criminal proceedings against eastern airlines and several of its 
managers withdrew from the case thursday because their clients 
dont have money to pay legal bills 
the lawyers had entered the case believing the air carrier would

however us bankruptcy judge burton r lifland who is 
overseeing the finances of the embattled airline last week refused 
to approve the payments 
eastern which is struggling to regain the confidence of the 
flying public especially business travelers is currently losing 
about 1 million a day 
an eastern spokesman said the carrier would try to help the 
employees possibly using voluntary contributions 
whatever we might be able to do at the company to assist them 
were going to explore and pursue said james r ashlock an 
eastern spokesman in miami 
theres been already a movement to obtain from the 18000 
eastern employees voluntary funds to underwrite the defense for 
these people the employees here do feel an affiliation and in 
many respects whats happened to them is unfair he said 
at a hearing thursday us district judge i leo glasser of 
brooklyn granted the lawyers request to be removed from the case 
the defendants who said they would seek courtappointed counsel 
were directed to return to court on nov 26 with their new lawyers 
the lawyers were dismissed hours after lifland granted eastern 
more time and money to show it could recover at least some of its 
past strength the airlines unsecured creditors had asked the 
bankruptcy judge to shut down eastern and liquidate it 
eastern once one of the nations top airlines was struggling 
to remain solvent when the airline and nine of its managers were 
indicted in august on criminal charges that they falsified 
maintenance and safety records to keep their jetliners in the air 
and carrying passengers 
the 60count indictment unprecedented in the airline industry 
charged a pattern of pressure and intimidation from the airlines 
headquarters in miami to keep the aircraft in flight at all 
costs 
two eastern foremen at kennedy airport have pleaded guilty to 
ignoring needed aircraft repairs and then falsifying records to 
make it appear the work had been done 
the foremen who are cooperating with prosecutors said the 
scheme was orchestrated by executives at the airline who coerced 
them into altering the documents 
the highest ranking executive charged was edward upton 40 a 
former vice president because of an earlier agreement eastern 
will pay his legal fees and his attorney stephen e kaufman will 
remain as his lawyer 
the law firm retained by eastern will also continue in the case 
one of the former defense lawyers edward j little said the 
trial is expected to last up to four months with legal fees for 
each of the defendants totalling 300000 or more little 
represented jacques jean a former maintenance supervisor accused 
of falsifying aircraft records 
the start of the trial originally scheduled for jan 28 1991 
will likely be postponed

campbell soup co on thursday said 
higher sales and a worldwide reorganization boosted firstquarter 
earnings 28 percent for the best quarter in the companys history 
for the three months ended oct 28 net earnings climbed to 
1051 million or 82 cents a share on sales of 16 billion in 
the first quarter last year earnings were 83 million or 64 cents 
a share on revenues of 15 billion 
we are pleased with the progress we have made during this 
first quarter and remain confident about the rest of the year 
campbell chief executive officer david w johnson said at a 
shareholders meeting 
johnson said campbells which has been struggling to improve 
its sluggish performance in the industry has turned the corner to 
profitability he said the 28 percent increase was the best 
quarterly performance in the companys 121year history 
the quarter was better than expected said john m mcmillin 
a food industry analyst with prudentialbache securities inc in 
new york they certainly got their fiscal year off to a good 
start 
in fiscal 1990 campbells profits dropped sharply as the 
company continued a twoyear restructuring and corporate makeover 
earnings for the year were 44 million or 3 cents per share 
compared with a profit of 13 million or 10 cents per share in 
1989 
the 90minute shareholder meeting was the first for johnson who 
was brought in last january as the first outsider to hold the ceo 
position in the companys history johnson who had run gerber 
products co was known for turning around beleaguered companies 
johnson announced that the board of directors had approved an 
increase in quarterly dividends from 25 cents to 29 cents per 
share payable jan 31 1991 
the higher earnings were seen as a first step toward pacifying 
disgruntled members of the founding dorrance family who own a 
major stake in campbells and have urged selling off the company 
the rift in the dorrance family and campbells depressed stock 
price had made the company the target of frequent takeover rumors 
campbell north america the companys largest division reported 
a 30 percent increase in operating earnings to 1777 million 
compared with 1372 million the year before 
strong volume gains in two new condensed soups cream of 
broccoli and the teddy bear line boosted sales for the period to 
11 billion from 109 billion last year 
operating earnings in campbells biscuit and bakery division 
were up 16 percent to 257 million from 221 million the year 
before boosted by a strong performance from pepperidge farm sales 
increased 9 percent to 212 million from 195 million in 1989 
favorable exchange rates boosted sales for campbell 
international by 18 percent to 307 million from 261 million last 
year operating earnings for the quarter were 41 million 
compared with 27 million last year 
johnson said campbell plans to boost its earnings per share by 
20 percent annually over the next few years he said the company 
also plans to achieve at least a 20 percent return on equity and a 
20 percent cash return on assets

health experts restaurant giants and the meat 
industry are all watching a mcdonalds corp consumer test of a 
superlean beef developed by replacing fat with an algae product 
called carrageenan 
analysts and industry insiders say if its successful the new 
product could reshape a beef industry often criticized by health 
experts for its fatty output 
if its really palatable its revolutionary said phil 
sokolof a millionaire industrialist from omaha who ran fullpage 
advertisements in several major newspapers accusing fastfood 
chains of selling too many highfat foods 
were talking about a complete change in american diet he 
said 
last year for the first time ever more chicken than beef was 
consumed in the united states a worried beef industry has sought 
for nearly half a decade to develop leaner beef for 
healthconscious consumers 
the answer may have come with carrageenan a gumlike substance 
used to bind ingredients together much as fat would said mary 
adolf a spokeswoman for the chicagobased beef industry council of 
the meat board 
i think whats interesting about this product is the lean 
patty itself has a taste and a texture similar to a product that 
has significantly more fat ms adolf said this product has a 
lot of potential 
carrageenan is widely used in pharmaceuticals and ice cream 
products but now is expanding into other areas including possible 
use in all processed meats to reduce fat said alan mathis a 
spokesman for national food processors in washington dc 
but national marketing of the beef or any other 
carrageenanbased product probably is a long way off said charles 
levitt a senior livestock analyst with shearson lehman brothers 
inc 
superlean beef is certainly not going to hurt beef demand 
any levitt said its not going to change overnight 
obviously and will take time to filter its way into the market 
but its a positive 
the food service industry is watching to see if the public will 
sink its teeth into the product 
mcdonalds said wednesday it is testmarketing in restaurants in 
the harrisburg pa area a lowfat hamburger that has carregeenan 
as an ingredient 
the quarterpound burger called lean deluxe and its condiments 
have 10 grams or 2 teaspoons of fat mcdonalds quarter pounder 
in contrast has 20 grams of fat 
dieticians recommend that a person eat no more than 67 grams of 
fat a day 
nutritionists hesitant to praise the lowfat beef outright 
expressed optimism 
the impact on a nation that loves its fatty hamburgers could 
be extremely dramatic said bonnie liebman nutrition director at 
the center for science in the public interest in washington dc 
the agriculture department also is considering buying the 
lowfat beef for the national school lunch program said dale 
huffman an auburn university meat biochemist who helped develop 
the meat 
obviously if the usda accepts the leaner meat it will be a 
boost and it would help immeasurably if kids like it since the 
majority of hamburger eaters are younger people huffman said 
his research and that at two other universities was funded by 
the meat board which since 1986 has collected 1 per head of 
cattle from ranchers to find ways to produce leaner beef

crude oil prices finished slightly lower 
thursday after seesawing in brisk trading in the absence of 
significant news from the persian gulf 
on the new york mercantile exchange the decemberdelivery 
contract for benchmark light sweet crude oil swung in a wide range 
rising as much as 69 cents a barrel and falling as much as 101 
before rallying to close at 3112 down 4 cents from a day 
earlier contracts for later months mostly rose 
the markets behavior reflected what traders called an 
underlying tendency to weaken unless theres a profound increase in 
persian gulf tensions that could provoke a longawaited fight 
between the united states and iraq 
the market tumbled nearly 2 a barrel wednesday as traders 
focused on the fundamentals of supply and demand which show that 
petroleum stockpiles are plentiful oil now is nearly 10 lower 
than the panicdriven highs reached during the tense stages of the 
3monthold iraqi occupation of kuwait 
basically what happened today is just a continuation of what 
weve been seeing said james fiedler a broker and vice 
president at edampf man international futures inc a new york 
trading concern ample supply falling demand and if there is a 
war it wont be soon 
traders said the markets rebound late in the day was 
accelerated by shortcovering in which traders who had sold 
borrowed oil contracts on the mistaken hunch they would fall in 
price scrambled to buy them back 
some traders said the markets late rally may have been a 
reaction to a rumor that the united states had formulated a 
specific attack date to retake kuwait from iraq but others said 
that rumor was stale speculation and had no influence on prices 
among refined products traded on the mercantile exchange 
wholesale homeheating oil for december delivery rose 3 cent to 
8667 cents a gallon contracts for more distant months also closed 
higher 
wholesale gasoline for december delivery fell 23 cents a gallon

using computers sophisticated imaging 
equipment and genetic mapping university scientists are trying to 
discover supercows in the laboratory 
if you look at genetics weve made so much more progress in 
the last 15 years than we made in the last 100 said mike brown 
of the national milk producers federation 
theres certainly more interest in it because its getting a 
little tougher to make a living in dairy he said 
economics is a driving force in the science of breeding a better 
bovine experts said 
the quest for the supercow has some real important management 
implications said william graves state dairy specialist at the 
university of massachusetts farmers are going to have to look 
for alternate ways to try and stay in business and still produce 
what they produce at less cost 
at the university of massachusetts professors abel ponce de 
leon and james robl are mapping part of the cows genetic package 
with the help of a threeyear 210000 grant from the usda the 
project also is supported by the eastern artificial insemination 
cooperative 
using existing studies that showed a variation in dna is related 
to milk production the researchers plan to isolate a particular 
chromosome called bovine chromosome 23 
we are going to concentrate on one chromosome where there is a 
high likelihood that there will be genes that participate in the 
control of milk production ponce de leon said 
what were doing is were using a direct approach to be able 
to select animals on their dna rather than on production traits or 
physical characteristics said robl 
the advantages of using molecular biology to track down good 
milkers is that it takes the trialanderror out of the equation 
said caird e rexroad a research physiologist with the us 
department of agriculture 
before we had to depend on the animals milk production and 
evaluating the production of the daughters of specific bulls 
rexroad said 
other scientific advances in dairy production include the 
process of selling frozen embryos from highyield cows to be 
implanted in surrogates 
genetic research is going on at various laboratories across the 
country said rexroad who said that ponce de leon and robl are the 
only team he knows of working to isolate a specific chromosome 
probably in the future we will have a few less cows on the 
farms than we do now these techniques will make it possible for 
the most efficient farmers to survive said rexroad

the bush administration is considering cuts in 
popular government benefit programs such as social security and 
medicare as part of the budget it will submit to congress in 
february an administration official said thursday 
the official who spoke on the condition his name not be used 
said the cuts being considered would reduce benefits for affluent 
recipients with the savings used to provide tax cuts to the poor 
and middle class 
such an action is clearly being contemplated very seriously 
said the official who also stressed that all planning for the new 
budget was in a very preliminary stage with final decisions a long 
way from being made 
meanwhile president bush received a gloomy assessment of 
economic prospects from a group of business executives on thursday 
they told the president they believed the country had probably 
entered a recession 
commenting later bush stopped short of saying the country was 
already in a downturn 
im not an economist but most seem to feel that if we have a 
recession that meets these technical terms that it will not be 
deep and that well come out of it relatively soon six months at 
most bush said in an interview on the cable news network 
in the past the administration and congress have both shied 
away from proposing cuts in social security and medicare because of 
the firestorm of protests such changes could raise 
the benefit cuts are receiving a second look the official said 
because the administration believes that the new deficitreduction 
agreement passed by congress conferred added authority 
in the past the administration shied away from proposing tax 
cuts and benefit reductions for fear that congress would pass the 
tax cuts and leave the benefit levels unchanged 
however the deficitreduction law passed last month includes a 
payasyougo mechanism that will trigger automatic benefit 
cuts unless congress reduces benefits in line with any tax 
reductions approved by lawmakers 
the possibility of the benefit cuts was first disclosed in 
thursdays wall street journal 
in his meeting with executives bush received a generally gloomy 
report on the prospects for the economy with the general consensus 
of the group being that the country was probably in a recession 
john g medlin jr president and chief executive officer of 
first wachovia corp a leading bank holding company told 
reporters afterward that the general consensus among the executives 
was that the country probably has entered its first recession in 
eight years 
i think there was probably a view that we may have slipped 
into a recession said medlin whose bank is headquartered in 
winstonsalem nc there was not much argument that we were 
somewhere in that area between a little growth and a little 
decline 
medlin said the executives representing banks and industrial 
firms noted in particular the problems besetting the construction 
and real estate industries which have been hard hit by 
overbuilding and slumping prices 
besides bush administration officials participating in 
thursdays meeting were treasury secretary nicholas brady budget 
director richard darman and john sununu bushs chief of staff 
a white house official who spoke on the condition he not be 
named said the president was trying to decide what steps to take 
to soften the impact of the current slowdown 
last week bush and michael boskin his chief economic adviser 
came close to saying the country is in a recession 
bush spoke of tough times and said he wanted to insure that 
to the degree a president can do something to soften the blow or 
to stimulate economic growth that he tries to do it 
the white house official said thursdays meeting followed a 
session bush had wednesday with federal reserve chairman alan 
greenspan and other top banking regulators 
at that meeting according to another administration source who 
also spoke on the condition of anonymity sununu and commerce 
secretary robert mosbacher talked about a slowdown in bank lending 
which they blamed on regulatory overkill in the wake of the savings 
and loan crisis 
mosbacher has complained for months about a credit crunch 
choking off the flow of credit needed to keep the economy healthy 
greenspan and other banking regulators however have argued 
that the slowdown in lending reflects current weak loan demand 
rather than bank examiners being over zealous 
administration officials have said that the president was 
reviewing various proposals to stimulate economic growth and would 
likely submit a set of recommendations as part of the 1991 budget 
which he will send to congress in early february 
medlin said neither the president nor any of the other 
administration officials gave any hint of what progrowth 
initiatives they may propose 
the president just listened he didnt give us his views 
medlin said he was very sincerely looking for views out in the 
real world 
the wednesday and thursday meetings were an outgrowth of a 
meeting bush had over the weekend at the presidential retreat at 
camp david md with brady boskin darman and vice president dan 
quayle 
boskin last week said that at best the economy was in a 
lull which he predicted would last through the first half of 1991 
he said that a new administration economic forecast due to be 
completed soon envisioned the possibility of the economy 
slipping into negative territory by years end 
boskin said it was possible that the economic contraction could 
last into early 1991 the traditional definition of a recession is 
two consecutive quarters in which the gross national product the 
total output of goods and services declines 
the white house refused to release a list of those meeting with 
bush saying the sessions were private 
its an opportunity for the president to hear them the 
business leaders these are listening sessions the white house 
official said

an industry committee told the food and drug 
administration on thursday that the agency needs more regulatory 
power over generic drugs including the ability to ban from the new 
drug business people who violate its regulations 
the panel established by the generic pharmaceutical industry 
association also said the agency should extend some regulations 
that apply to newly branded drugs to generic drugs and generic 
manufacturers trade associations should establish a code of ethics 
for members 
the blue ribbon committee on generic medicines was established 
in the wake of disclosures that some generic companies had faked 
test results and accusations that some company executives had 
bribed fda employees 
a new drug if patented may not be manufactured by anyone 
except the holder of the patent or a company licensed by a patent 
holder when the patent expires however anyone may make the drug 
as a generic and those drugs are generally cheaper than the 
original 
approval for patented drugs is a long and difficult process that 
takes years and requires the manufacturer to show that the drug is 
both safe and effective 
approval for generic drugs is much simpler the manufacturer 
generally has to show only that the drug reaches approximately the 
same concentration in the bloodstream that the original does 
in those equivalence tests some companies did not actually test 
their own drug but tested the branded original against itself a 
form of cheating practically guaranteed to show what the industry 
calls bioequivalence 
the committee believes generic medicines make a major 
contribution to consumers the panel of five physicians and two 
lawyers said in a statement summarizing its recommendations 
the committee recognizes that its recommendations may increase 
some companies costs but nonetheless believes that the increased 
benefit to the public associated with a reliable supply of generic 
drugs justifies the additional expense 
the summary gave no examples of what the increased costs might 
amount to 
congress the committee said should 
permit the agency to debar individuals who commit certain 
offenses from participating in the development application for 
approval manufacture or sale of products regulated by the food and 
drug administration 
increase criminal penalties and require a return of profits 
resulting from criminal misconduct 
require corporations whose employees are convicted of 
misconduct in the approval process to prove that their products are 
still safe and effective 
give the fda additional subpoena powers 
the committee said fda should 
require public disclosure of any financial arrangements outside 
of feeforservice contracts between applicants for approval of 
generic drugs and testing laboratories 
impose the same standards of responsibility for generic 
applicants that currently pertain to applicants sponsoring 
experimental drugs 
try to identify and resolve controversial issues before 
beginning review of new generic drugs 
issue additional guidance to the industry on how to demonstrate 
bioequivalence

wall streets struggling securities firms face 
weak profits and more consolidation in the 1990s as they regroup in 
an increasingly competitive world market moodys investors service 
said thursday 
in its annual report on the securities industry moodys said 
reversing the mammoth buildup in the heyday of bigfee mergers and 
active stock markets in the 1980s will be the focus of the current 
decade 
this overcapacity will take years to reduce and will put 
fundamental downward pressure on securities firms returns said 
the report written by moodys vice president john kriz 
the securities industry has struggled since the october 1987 
stock market crash more than 45000 jobs have been erased and the 
key business lines of investment banking leveraged buyouts and 
mergers and acquisitions have nosedived 
the outlook now is that those three areas will be much much 
smaller and in some cases nonexistent said moodys vice 
president christopher mahoney who helped prepare the report 
the street was subsidizing a lot of growth domestically and 
internationally from lucrative businesses that are drying up or 
diminishing he said 
moodys predicted further consolidation leading to domination by 
firms created through acquisition by wealthy companies 
ultimately there may be few if any large independent wall 
street securities firms the report said 
the power of diversified strong owners has been a theme of the 
industrys woes this year in which several major securities firms 
have been bailed out of severe financial difficulty by 
deeppocketed parents 
most recently cs first boston inc this week received a 300 
million equity infusion from its swiss parent cs holding which 
took majority control of the investment banking firm cs first 
bostons main us subsidiary is first boston corp 
mahoney said a problem with the trend is that the survival of 
the fittest is thrown on its head wall streets failed firms used 
to be acquired by the successful ones 
one impediment to that now is that a lot of weak firms are 
owned by strong parents so they dont die a natural death 
mahoney said theyre not absorbed by strong firms theyre 
maintained as independent entities 
the moodys report said intense competition continued 
overcapacity and the decline in major business segments mean weak 
prospects for profitability on wall street through the end of the 
century 
additional risks are the temptation for managements to ease 
profit pressure by taking greater risks and the likelihood of more 
aggressive involvement in us and overseas securities markets by 
powerful foreign securities firms and banks moodys said 
the report also cited a recent erosion of the depressionera 
glasssteagall act that prevented commercial banks from entering 
the securities industry 
it said several us bankholding companies including jp 
morgan citicorp and bankers trust are eager to expand further 
into the securities business and they pose important competitive 
threats to us securities firms 
a similar trend is occurring in japan moodys said increasing 
the challenge to us firms core businesses and markets 
firms across the board face costcutting pressures moodys 
said likely targets for reductions are reducing the ballooned 
compensation of the 1980s eliminating whole businesses and exiting 
from unprofitable foreign markets 
the 1980s goal of becoming a global player in a broad range of 
products is fading for many firms moodys said managements 
are refocusing on core business in which they can build sustainable 
competitive advantages 
mahoney said the street lost a lot of money in london and 
tokyo

lawyers for investors and companies that bought 
junk bonds from drexel burnham lambert inc filed claims thursday 
for well over 10 billion alleging rampant lawbreaking by the 
collapsed wall street firm 
the claims in us bankruptcy court are in addition to 68 
billion sought by two federal thrift bailout agencies and by far 
exceed the amount drexel can dole out in its chapter 11 
reorganization 
attorneys were still calculating the total but said litigation 
claims against drexel would exceed 20 billion 
one new york law firm alone filed 11 cases seeking 928 billion 
on behalf of shareholders and companies that assert they were 
defrauded by drexel the once highflying investment firm that 
sought bankruptcy court refuge in february 
thursday was the filing deadline for claims against drexel 
after a lengthy hearing us bankruptcy judge frank conrad denied 
a government request for another 90 days to examine the junk bond 
holdings of more savings and loans 
more than 100 civil lawsuits have been filed against drexel 
lawyers for the firm plaintiffs and the government are negotiating 
to estimate how much drexel will set aside to pay all the 
litigation claims 
drexel would use that figure in devising a reorganization plan 
and claimants could receive a fixed percentage based on the amount 
of their claims a negotiated estimate would be presented to us 
district judge milton pollack for approval 
in bankruptcy size frequently prevails over quality said 
david berger a philadelphia lawyer who is heading a mass of cases 
against drexel its convicted junk bond financier michael milken 
and others 
the estimate is not expected to come close to meeting the 
claims drexel has only about 3 billion in assets plus various 
investments and a long list of creditors who might take 
preference but the enormous claims could carry negotiating 
leverage and potentially dilute the pot for others 
the creditors who actually loaned money and bought bonds 
in what was then a very solvent company it seems very unfair to 
them said steven felderstein lawyer for californias public 
employees retirement system a large drexel creditor 
everybody sees drexel as a place where theres a lot of money 
and everybody wants their oar in the water he said 
most claims are related to drexels 1989 guilty plea to six 
felony counts involving illegal trading the thrift claims involve 
allegations that drexel ran a corrupt junk bond network that helped 
push dozens of savings and loans to collapse 
all the damages sought have been tripled to reflect alleged 
racketeering violations 
in a 60page bankruptcy court filing the federal thrift bailout 
agencies claimed drexel preached a gospel of greed that 
defrauded savings and loans by peddling inappropriate and risky 
securities from 1982 
the federal deposit insurance corp and resolution trust corp 
alleged that drexel made billions of dollars by inducing sampls to 
use their federally insured deposits to buy junk bonds 
the exposure of drexels and milkens criminality destroyed 
the illusions surrounding junk bonds that drexel and milken had 
sought to create the filing said 
the agencies charged drexel manipulated junk bond prices 
arranged secret securities parking deals ran sham 
transactions bribed favored customers and controlled a network of 
sampl customers to sustain a houseofcards market 
the filing presents the most vivid picture yet of allegations of 
impropriety in drexels dominance of the 200 billion market for 
the securities which compensated for the risk of default by 
offering high yields 
it lists 41 failed thrifts with junk bond losses totaling more 
than 330 million and seeks more than 125 million more in damages 
for the lost value of current holdings another 18 failed thrifts 
have separate nonjunk bond claims institutions from 18 states and 
the district of columbia are included 
the alleged damages are tripled under federal antitrust and 
racketeering laws for a total of 6 billion the agencies seek 
800 million for alleged illegal activity unrelated to junk bonds 
a separate claim of more than 45 billion was filed on behalf 
of columbia savings and loan association of beverly hills calif 
a major drexel customer which has not been taken over by the 
government 
drexel said it was targeted as a convenient scapegoat for the 
sampl crisis by the federal agencies other creditors also said the 
blame was misplaced and that the government claims likely would 
face challenges in court 
the fdic monitored the operations of all these thrifts while 
they were in business and did not take any steps to stop it while 
the actual conduct was going on said barry dichter attorney for 
one of drexels largest creditors

jurors on thursday ordered lockheed corp to 
pay 453 million in damages to three former employees who claimed 
they were wrongfully fired for questioning the safety of the giant 
c5b military cargo plane 
lockheed said it will appeal 
we believe the punitive damages are an injustice and come as a 
result of appealing to the passions and prejudice of the jury 
said lockheed attorney gordon krischer the evidence doesnt 
warrant this verdict 
the plaintiffs asserted that four c5bs built with defective 
mainframes continue to fly and are currently transporting troops to 
saudi arabia said herbert hafif lawyer for two of the 
whistleblowers 
our next move is to ask the congress to investigate this 
hafif said asserting that evidence in the trial proved the planes 
are seriously flawed 
the superior court jury announced the award after six days of 
deliberations and a sixweek trial 
the verdict speaks for itself hafif said it is the first 
opportunity that regular citizens have had to speak to the faulty 
inspections violations specifications and other transgressions 
that permeate this industry and consume so much of the taxpayers 
dollars 
clyde w jones jr 62 now of tennessee terrence f schielke 
40 of lancaster and thomas e benecke 48 of thousand oaks said 
in their lawsuit they were dismissed in 1985 after they wrote 
letters to lockheeds second highestranking official demanding 
that the c5b be grounded until tests could be made 
the three said they were concerned about deficiencies in the 
mainframe of the cargo plane 
krischer claimed that jones had already elected to retire before 
lockheed officials learned of the trios concerns schielke and 
benecke were dismissed for circumventing company policies and audit 
procedures he said 
schielke an auditing supervisor on the project said he 
repeatedly tried to warn the company that flawed parts were being 
used 
the frames were cracked warped twisted he said thursday 
and instead of scrapping them they went ahead and used them 
because it would have put them so far behind schedule to scrap them 
that the defense department would not have bought the planes 
each plaintiff was awarded 15 million in punitive damages 
awards for compensatory damages and emotional distress totaled 
202065 for benecke 91660 for jones and 82789 for schielke 
the amount of punitive damages is grossly disproportionate to 
the actual damages found by the jury and is insupportable factually 
and legally said the lockheed vice presidents statement 
eric julber who represented benecke said the jury award sends 
a message that you shouldnt fire people for raising safety 
concerns 
he said lockheed lawyers had informed the plaintiffs they will 
move for a new trial and failing that will appeal the case 
this could go all the way to the supreme court because of the 
size of the punitive damages julber said 
however hafif noted that the jurys award on actual damages was 
far less than what the plaintiffs had requested they had asked for 
about 15 million and were given a total of about 376000

community newspapers inc said thursday it 
will repurchase a big chunk of troublesome junkbond debt which 
was believed to play a role in the departure of publisher ralph 
ingersoll ii earlier this year 
the newspaper chain which publishes three dailies in ohio said 
it had reached agreement with holders of about twothirds of its 
junk bonds to repurchase for 130 million in cash a batch of the 
risky securities with a face value totaling about 240 million 
the move is a good one for community newspapers because it 
alleviates the companys obligation to pay the high rate of 
interest on the bonds said ned p zachar an analyst with duff amp 
phelps inc in chicago 
community newspapers said in a statement that it expects to 
complete the transactions by the first week of january 
the holders of the outstanding 13 percent senior subordinated 
notes due july 1 1997 would get 95 million in cash holders of 
subordinated discount debentures would get 35 million in cash 
these were some of the same bonds that troubled ingersoll a 
prominent publisher who used extensive junkbond financing to 
expand his usnewspaper holdings in the 1980s but encountered 
difficulty making the interest payments as advertising revenue 
weakened 
in july community newspapers said it couldnt make an interest 
payment on some of these bonds after ingersoll sought 
unsuccessfully to repurchase them at the same time ingersoll 
traded his us properties and their debt burden to investment 
partner em warburg pincus amp co in exchange for control of a 
smaller group of european newspapers 
ingersoll said the deal was driven by a desire to get more 
involved in european publishing but bankers and investors said his 
newspaper buying spree had left him with too much debt 
robert jelenic chief executive officer of the journal register 
co said thursday night he was pleased with the deal 
this transaction is supposed to close in january and ill be 
extremely happy im pleased with the deal as it is structured 
jelenic said in a telephone interview from new jersey 
community newspapers publishes the morning journal in lorain 
the news herald in lake county and the dovernew philadelphia times
