police said friday 
police in chiclayo said a report from bagua a river town 435 
miles north of lima said the four were shot to death and their 
bodies dumped into the maranon river the report said the bodies 
were seen in the river oct 10 near santa maria de nieva 600 miles 
north of lima but they were not retrieved 
the victims were on a filming expedition of aguaruna indians on 
the maranon in the northeastern state of amazonas according to 
julio quispe a telephone company official in chiclayo 465 miles 
north of lima 
quispe said in a telephone interview that he was in radio 
contact with wilder sanchez a telephone company employee and 
brother of ramiro sanchez the mining engineer 
quispe said wilder sanchez went to the area after hearing his 
brother had been killed and gave the following account 
the frenchmen all in their 20s were on a canoe trip following 
the maranon from its source in the andes to the amazon basin when 
they met ramiro sanchez a 23yearold engineer working at a gold 
mining project 
the engineer who spoke french and was familiar with the area 
agreed to accompany the students on their expedition after being 
briefly detained oct 6 at an army outpost at puerto imazita 495 
miles north of lima the four continued down the river and on oct 
7 stopped at puerto nativo de chipe a village of aguaruna indians 
near santa maria de nieva 
he said the indians apparently attacked when the group tried to 
film members of the tribe 
the lima newspaper el comercio said reports broadcast by a radio

students was shot when some indians tried to steal the groups film 
equipment it said the three other victims tried to escape in a 
boat but were pursued and slain by the aguarunas 
victoria pita spokeswoman for the french embassy in lima said 
officials there had no information on the reports and were 
investigating there were conflicting versions of the names of the 
students and she said the embassy was attempting to determine the 
identities 
in the same area in 1979 a group of aguaruna indians attacked 
and burned the camp of german film director werner herzog during 
the filming of the movie fitzcarraldo 
the aguaruna are a branch of the jivaro tribe known for its 
poisondart blowguns and history of headhunting most of the 
indians who are believed to number about 30000 are fisherman or 
smallplot farmers 
quispe said sanchez told him over the radio that the names of 
the frenchmen were jaime terry paul 24 joseph trichpo olarf 28 
and jean christophe monviale 24

nicaraguan president daniel ortega 
said friday night he is ending the 20monthold ceasefire with the 
contras because of savage attacks by the rebels 
ortegas pronouncement threw a shock wave into the celebration 
of democracy he was attending in this latin nation with president 
bush and leaders of more than a dozen other countries from 
throughout the western hemisphere 
the sandinista leader in a speech to 3000 students and others 
at the university of costa rica charged that the contras have 
stepped up fighting in an effort to interfere with the elections 
scheduled for feb 25 
ortega addressing 3000 people at the university said the 
drop of water that made the glass spill over was the attack that 
the mercenaries launhd on oct 22 the last day of voter 
registration when campesinos who wanted to vote were assassinated 
according to our security information 19 campesinos were 
assassinated and six others were injured this means that the 
contras are trying to deny the nicaraguan people their right to an 
electoral process he said 
after these savage attacks i met with the army high command to 
analyze the situation and the result of the analysis was that the 
ceasefire could not be maintained said ortega 
we have to guarantee the safety of the nicaraguan people and 
the electoral process which means we have to organize the army 
better and means it is unacceptable for us to disarm ourselves 
the nicaraguan said before departing for a formal dinner with 
presidents and prime ministers 
earlier ortegas press secretary manuel espinosa said the 
sandinista leader would make the official announcement on saturday 
that he was calling off the ceasefire espinosa said tuesday oct 
31 will be the last day of the ceasefire 
the ceasefire has been in effect since march 1988 but the two 
sides never came to a formal agreement and the sandinistas have 
unilaterally extended it on a monthly basis 
secretary of state james a baker iii fielding questions from 
reporters about the days diplomacy said i hope its not true 
when asked about ortegas reported intentions he said it would be 
a step back from peace 
he said the nicaraguan leader had not mentioned the subject 
during the closeddoor sessions with other leaders gathered in 
costa rica and said that if ortega does intend to end the 
ceasefire maybe hes too ashamed to have said so at the meeting 
on aug 7 five central american presidents agreed to disband 
the contras in exchange for democratization in nicaragua 
the contras were not a party to that agreement and their field 
commander israel galeano said that his troops would move back 
into nicaragua with their weapons rather than disband 
galeano known as commander franklin said his troops would not 
launch offensive operations before the feb 25 vote but would 
defend themselves if attacked 
nicaraguan defense minister humberto ortega daniels brother 
said in september that his troops would do the same 
the contras have been based at camps in honduras since the 
united states ended military aid to the movement formally known as 
the nicaraguan resistance in february 1988

president bush sat down with latin 
american leaders on friday for a celebration of democracy but the 
occasion was marred by nicaraguan president daniel ortegas 
decision to end a 20month ceasefire with usbacked contra rebels 
bush and ortega exchanged a friendly handshake before 
joining the other leaders gathered to celebrate a century of 
democracy in costa rica 
and secretary of state james a baker said nicaraguas leftist 
leader made no mention of his plans during lengthy talks with heads 
of 16 north and south american countries that focused on drugs 
latin american debt and eagerness to see panamas manuel antonio 
noriega removed from power 
maybe if he does intend to do that he was too ashamed to 
bring it up with the other heads of state in attendance baker 
said but certainly it would be a step backward in the peace 
process 
but in between the closeddoor diplomatic sessions and the 
dinner with fellow leaders ortega told a college audience that 
contras had committed savage attacks against peasants earlier 
this month in a move to disrupt elections scheduled for february 
he said he had concluded the cease fire could not be 
maintainedwe have to guarantee the safety of the nicaraguan 
people and the electoral process which means we have to organize 
the army better and means it is unacceptable for us to disarm 
ourselves 
salvadoran president alfredo cristiani said ortegas decision 
was a serious blow to the central american peace plan we should 
all understand that the solution isnt easy 
ortegas decision spread throughout the delegations as the 
leaders turned their attention from closeddoor diplomacy to an 
evening of dining and socializing the twoday costa rican 
conference ends on saturday with the dedication of a plaza marking 
a century of democratic government 
host president oscar arias said that three hours of private 
talks at a resort outside town gave his latin guests a chance to 
express their preoccupations their worries their frustrations 
at their inability to give our people more prosperity because of 
debt because of war because of an unjust international commercial 
system 
baker said the talk turned to the possibility of a drug summit 
panamas noriega not in attendance and foreign debt 
rodrigo borja president of ecuador said the leaders discussed 
the decline in coffee prices that has affected his country brazil 
colombia el salvador and costa rica among others 
but whatever diplomacy there was the attention was on bush and 
ortega one the head of a government that has spent millions 
trying to unhorse the other 
im not going to miss this said venezuelan president carlos 
andres perez leaning in to catch the small talk that bush and 
ortega exchanged when they shook hands before the first session 
i told president bush that my government supports the 
electoral process and that we are working for peace in nicaragua 
ortega told reporters afterwards 
bush arrived in this capital to cheers when he declared i 
believe we can create here in the americas the worlds first 
completely democratic hemisphere 
an extraordinary security force 4000 strong was deployed to 
protect the leaders at the twoday celebration of democracy 
arranged by arias a nobel peace prize winner for his efforts to 
promote democracy in the region 
the secret service imported a twoinchthick 75foot long sheet 
of bulletproof glass in front of the national museum for saturdays 
inauguration of democracy plaza to protect bush colombian 
president virgilio barco and the others barcos life has been 
threatened by drug barons in his country 
we must do away with all the dictatorships in america because 
there will be no peace among us while even one of them remains 
arias said in welcoming remarks 
there can be no tranquililty for our people when one 
government lends itself to hiding corruption and distributing 
drugs he said in an apparent reference to panamas noriega 
baker said salvadoran president cristiani appealed directly to 
ortega to stop shipping arms to rebels in el salvador but the 
nicaraguan president gave no reply 
ortega said 17 or 18 sandinista soldiers were killed in an 
attack by contra rebels last week baker said 
however baker made clear that the united states does not regard 
the reported killings as justification for abandoning the 
ceasefire there have been deaths on both sides as the result of 
skirmishes baker said 
he said ending the ceasefire could be seized upon as a 
desperate effort to cancel the elections scheduled for feb 25 in 
nicaragua 
he acknowledged that several thousand contras have moved back 
into nicaragua from neighboring honduras and said we are 
opposed and let the resistance know we are opposed to any offensive 
action on their part 
bush and ortega traded barbed comments from afar before the 
facetoface meeting and the president made a point of giving 
nicaraguan opposition candidate violeta chamorro a kiss when they 
met she and panamanian opposition leader guillermo endara were 
invited guests and bush planned to confer with both over coffee on 
saturday 
the white house issued a brief statement saying bush and ortega 
met momentarily and shook hands in a friendly manner but 
decided not to release a photo of their encounter 
bush began his journey saying today there are only a few 
lonely holdouts against the sweep of democracy through this 
hemisphere 
he arrived to a bear hug from arias and officials announced a 
tentative agreement that will allow osta rica to reduce its 45 
billion foreign debt burden by 1 billion arias called it the 
best gift we could possibly make to future generations of costa 
ricans 
two days before traveling here bush extended trade sanctions 
against nicaragua the united states continues to supply nonlethal 
aid to the contras despite a central american agreement to disband 
their forces in exchange for democratization in nicaragua 
other leaders here in addition to bush arias and ortega are 
alfredo cristiani of el salvador michael manley of jamaica brian 
mulroney of canada jose sarney of brazil jose azcona hoyo of 
honduras carlos saul menem of argentina carlos andres perez of 
venezuela julio maria sanguinetti of uruguay george price of

despite their toughguy image army drill 
sergeants have emotions like anybody else you dont believe it 
the army says so and it also says drill sergeants can suffer from 
jobrelated stress 
we have the image of drill sergeants as rough dominant 
harddriving who can bite nails in half that guy is also a human 
being said sgt maj james williams of the infantry training 
center at fort benning 
now the army is trying to help the sergeants cope with 14hour 
days family responsibilities and job pressures through a stress 
management program that started at fort benning on oct 11 
two other training posts fort sill okla and fort leonard 
wood mo have similar programs 
at fort benning 51 drill sergeants and 18 wives spent most of 
one recent day discussing problems in group sessions the meetings 
were moderated by mental health professionals assisted by the 
chaplain 
williams said the wives learned about the dedication and 
responsibilities of drill sergeants and the husbands learned about 
the importance of communicating with their wives 
the seminars will be scheduled quarterly for drill sergeants who 
have been on the job between nine and 12 months williams said 
wives are encouraged to attend 
we want to know if were doing anything wrong or if there is 
something we can do to assist them said williams we try to 
find out if there are stress factors a person could have stress 
and not know it we make them aware of the indicators 
staff sgt chester bullard 29 who is in the 10th month of a 
twoyear tour as a drill sergeant said he and his colleagues have 
to be stern to maintain discipline and ensure that recruits meet 
training goals 
bullard and two other drill sergeants are responsible for 56 
recruits who may turn to them for help resolving personal problems 
that could affect their performance in basic training 
the image is a tough guy said bullard a bachelor but 
there are times you have to talk to them oneonone and tell them 
hey im human too ive been through those problems i was a 
private 
bullard said drill sergeants watch each other for signs of 
stress and try to help by working longer than usual so that their 
buddies can catch up on sleep or spend a few extra hours with their 
families 
about 22000 recruits arrive at the infantry training center 
each year for basic and infantry training the center has a staff 
of 7800 including 440 drill sergeants 
during the 13 weeks the drill sergeant probably sees his 
soldiers more than his family said williams the wives become 
the family figures to the kids the wife has to take the kids to 
the doctor get gas in the car take the dog to the vet do the 
shopping and take care of the mail while dad is away 
williams said there is no evidence of any special spouse abuse 
problems among drill sergeants although some carry their problems 
home with them and worry about the performance of their trainees 
during the two years he is a drill sergeant he molds a lot of 
people said williams that soldier may not remember his high 
school teacher but hell remember that first drill sergeant 
thats the guy who gets your attention right away you see him when 
you wake up and you see him when you go to bed a lot of soldiers 
who go through say thats what i want to be like i want to be 
like my drill sergeant

alexander solzhenitsyns longbanned chronicle of 
soviet prison camps and political repression the gulag 
archipelago is now recommended reading in at least one 
11thgrade moscow history class 
as recently as last year highschool history textbooks made no 
mention of dictator josef stalins mass repressions in 1989 the 
new 10thgrade text states tentative estimates put the total 
number of deaths in the repressions at about 40 million people 
glasnost or openness is rapidly rewriting soviet history 
sometimes faster than the soviets can rewrite their childrens 
textbooks 
in june 1988 educators were ordered to cancel secondary school 
history exams because the tests would have required parroting of 
communist party dogma at odds with dramatic disclosures in the 
press about the nations recent past 
a prodigious effort began to rewrite soviet history and the 
editors work has begun appearing in classrooms 
the inclusion of solzhenitsyns work on a recommended reading 
list is one sign of how quickly barriers are falling a soviet 
magazine published the first portions of the documentary study in 
august the full book has yet to appear 
a teachers guide produced by the moscow city education 
committee charges that stalin imprisoned millions of people because 
his crash industrialization program required that workers move to 
harsh environments 
since there werent enough volunteers there appeared dozens 
of camps in the necessary places with hundreds of thousands of 
prisoners the guide says 
inmates were turned into a mute labor force requiring 
practically no expenses easily commanded and easily transferred 
it continues at least 5 million people had their property 
confiscated and were shipped off to siberia and other remote places 
the book admits that whole regions died in famines during 
the early 1930s caused by stalins forced collectivization of 
farms 
we dont know the exact number of deaths caused by the 
authorities the book says western scientists estimate 3 
million to 10 million people 
back in 1974 when leonid brezhnev was in power a 10thgrade 
history text described the 1930s as a period of rapid 
industrialization rife with victories for labor 
the revised text blames stalin once credited with saving the 
motherland from nazi annihilation for making disastrous mistakes 
it says stalin repressed a word used to mean imprisoned or 
killed in the purges those who favored preparation for war 
including five directors of army intelligence it notes that on 
june 22 1941 when german troops invaded many soviet border 
guards had the day off 
this mistake in calculating the time of the attack resulted in 
great loss of life the textbook says 
the new books candor in describing the purges and the terrible 
price exacted by stalins belief that adolf hitler would never 
attack the soviet union has startled adults accustomed to dull 
recitations of the party line 
if they wrote this five years ago they would be in a camp 
said one former political prisoner who asked not to be identified 
by name 
but teaching the real past still poses risks just last spring 
according to the exprisoners son a civics teacher disappeared 
from his eighthgrade class after using recent magazine articles to 
teach about stalins repressions even though officials had advised 
teachers to do so 
he was the first guy who wanted us to really know the history 
of our country the 15yearold said the new teacher went back 
to rote memorizing 
the rush to rewrite history has left todays high school 
students with a strange mixture of old and new texts 
our journalists are continuously publishing new information 
about our history but textbooks must be finished and released for 
school said alexander samsonov history editor for the education 
publishing house in moscow 
that leaves him in the difficult position of figuring out which 
reports are sufficiently supported both by facts and politicians 
for presentation to students he said 
the new 10thgrade history text walks a fine line between 
western and traditional soviet versions of the events that 
triggered world war ii 
what the baltic republics consider a soviet invasion of their 
countries is explained with the euphemism soviet power was 
restored in latvia lithuania and estonia 
the book does not state that the nazisoviet nonaggression pact 
of 1939 divided the baltics and poland into soviet and nazi spheres 
of influence as a kremlin official only recently admitted 
but the textbook does say the treaty was unjust because it 
took place behind the back of the polish people 
the textbook acknowledges abuses of power and violations of 
law in the baltics but doesnt explain that tens of thousands of 
baltic residents were deported to camps in the frozen wastelands of 
siberia and the far north estonias government is now considering 
paying damages to the victims and their families

iris knorrs late husband put something 
away for a rainy day and forgot about it 
the rainy day came with hurricane hugo which badly damaged the 
hotel mrs knorr runs in the caribbean an unexpected windfall 
arrived shortly thereafter 3547569 in stock that her husband 
had left behind 
mrs knorr found out about the unknown assets thanks to an ohio 
state agency now spending the money will be easy she said 
thursday from the caribbean island of nevis where expensive 
repairs to her hotel are underway 
warren g knorr sr had purchased 897 shares of united cable 
television co stock while the couple lived in mansfield ohio 
in 1980 the knorrs moved to nevis in the leeward islands of 
the caribbean they bought a 14room inn the old manor hotel on 
an old sugar plantation shortly after they bought the hotel knorr 
died 
mrs knorr didnt know about the stock sitting in a brokerage 
account in 1987 the account was declared inactive and the stock 
was turned over to the ohio department of commerces division of 
unclaimed funds 
the division takes responsibility for bank accounts investments 
and other assets left behind by people who move away or die without 
claiming the money the division sold the stock and placed the 
money in an account in knorrs name where it continued to earn 
interest 
in some states such accounts are maintained for a few years and 
then revert to the states general fund if no heir is found in 
ohio such an account could theoretically keep accumulating 
interest forever the division has 22 million accounts worth more 
than 77 million its oldest account was started in 1865 and was 
held by a bank until the division was established in 1968 
mrs knorr knew nothing of the stock when hugo slammed into the 
caribbean on sept 1617 with winds blowing at 140 mph it killed 
an estimated 56 people in the caribbean and 29 more on the us 
mainland 
mrs knorr said the storm was unlike anything she had imagined 
i thought it would never stop she said ive never been 
in a tornado but theyre over in a few minutes but this hurricane 
 
the hotel suffered extensive exterior damage also losing a part 
of the roof a poolside cabana and exterior light fixtures some of 
the damage was covered by insurance but not all she said 
the check from her late husbands stocks arrived a week ago and 
will help with repairs to the roof and electrical system 
thomas gerace director of the division of unclaimed funds said 
mrs knorr initially learned of her windfall from her son who saw 
it listed in advertisements prepared by the division and published 
in ohio newspapers 
being able to return the money to mrs knorr under such 
unusual circumstances makes this one of the most interesting cases 
we have handled gerace said 
janet peoples a division spokeswoman said mrs knorr never 
knew of her husbands dabbling in the market 
she was elated about getting it in the first place and 
ecstatic about getting it to rebuild ms peoples said 
the division has paid 20000 claims this year worth more than 7 
million 
i never even knew there was a division of unclaimed funds 
mrs knorr said im amazed that they were so diligent in finding 
me

military jets scream across this 
lonely island near marthas vineyard and pepper it with dummy bombs 
but environmentalists dont mind because wildlife is thriving in 
spite of the noise 
the important factor is that there are no people on the island 
the island owned by the navy since 1952 is a crucial resting 
spot for migratory birds on their way from canada and the northeast 
to central and south america to protect the rare species found on 
the island the us department of interior established the 
northeastern third of the island as a wildlife sanctuary in 1975 
but the rest of the 640acre island is a target range used by 
pilots from the navy reserves marine corps reserves and the air 
national guards of massachusetts new york and connecticut 
its the only air target range in this region said ensign 
edward matlock a spokesman for the weymouth naval air station 
which runs the island the closest alternatives are in maryland or 
canada he said 
pilots are supposed to aim orange practice bombs bearing no 
explosives at a 200foot ring of tires with a center point of 
large tractor tires arranged like a bullseye 
earlier this month teams had to go tidy up the site because 
kneehigh grass made it hard for pilots to see the target said 
capt john g kuchinski jr who commands the weymouth station 
they end up dropping them bombs elsewhere in the island 
kuchinski said 
a recent inspection by a team of environmentalists military 
personnel and engineers did find one bomb inside the sanctuary 
kuchinski has warned pilots that they could be stripped of their 
wings if they are caught violating the sanctuary boundaries 
and civilians on marthas vineyard a couple of miles away 
across the ocean keep watch on nomans occasionally reporting 
when they see a b52 or an f111b straying over the sanctuary 
kuchinski said 
flight crews are like everybody else kuchinski said 
occasionally you get somebody who thinks he has a license to do 
anything 
despite the jets and bombs leading wildlife officials say they 
actually welcome the navys stewardship of the island 
if the public were not wary of unexploded ordnance left on the 
island live bombs were used in the past and the penalties 
threatened trespassers on government property people would swarm 
over the island they say 
in a very short time the island would be trashed said 
augustus ben david ii director of the felix neck wildlife 
sancutary on the vineyard 
if it were turned over to the fish and wildlife service its 
enforcement against trespassers would go down rather than up 
said tom french head of the states natural heritage and 
endangered species program 
when ben david and french visited the island with the military 
cleanup crew they saw 41 species of birds and eight kinds of 
butterflies 
ben david said he spotted three species of turtles canada 
geese swarms of herring gulls and a wonderful muskrat 
population 
the vegetation is so rich that crossing a cranberry bog is like 
walking on a mattress he said 
wildlife is all over even in the target zones said ben 
david its absolutely an incredible place from a naturalists 
standpoint an incredible place 
french said he saw canadian forest birds birds of prey and 
even a few peregrine falcons nesting in the 80foot bluffs along 
the shore 
i understand that it sounds terrible to have people bombing 
the island said french but what you expect to see and what 
reality is are worlds apart

two more victims of a phillips petroleum 
co plastic plant explosion were discovered thursday night and the 
search continued for 15 more workers missing since the blast 
the two bodies were found in the rubble outside a reactor 
control room said phillips spokesman scott carlberg a total of 
seven bodies have been found so far 
carlberg also said that one of the bodies has been identified as 
jeffrey l harrison 36 of houston none of the others have been 
identified yet 
the search process was slowed earlier in the day when officials 
discovered a hydrocarbon leak near the blast site 
officials temporarily halted recovery work and ordered reporters 
several hundred yards from the scene so other workers equipped with 
monitors could determine if the level of vapor was dangerous 
this is the kind of material we said we might encounter 
said carlberg were taking an extremely conservative safety 
measure 
phillips spokesman george minter later said authorities believed 
there was no danger 
a series of explosions ripped through the plant monday injuring 
more than 100 people 
crews manning bulldozers and cranes in the second day of 
roundtheclock search work were moving thursday toward a control

healthy women who dont smoke should be able 
to take birth control pills until menopause without significantly 
increasing their risk of heart attack or stroke a government panel 
of experts says 
though these women could face an increased risk of 
cardiovascular problems with pill use this would be outweighed by 
the risks of not taking the pill namely abortion or carrying a 
pregnancy to term panel members agreed thursday 
older women need contraception and you have to weigh the 
risks and the benefits said barbara hulka panel chairwoman and 
head of the epidemiology department at the university of north 
carolina school of public health 
with the hormone levels in currently prescribed pills far lower 
than they were in the early birth control pills medical 
researchers believe the risks found with the highdose pills are 
reduced 
additionally studies have shown that pill use offers some 
protection against cancer of the uterus and ovary 
when you look at the whole picture oral contraceptives may be 
the best bet for some older healthy women hulka said she 
added though that more research is needed to better determine the 
risks of pill use in older women 
the food and drug administration will consider the 
recommendation thursday by the fertility and maternal health drugs 
advisory committee to scrap the current practice of advising 
healthy nonsmoking women to stop taking the pill the most 
effective contraceptive when they turn 40 
but the panel said the warning against pill use for women over 
35 who smoke should remain because of an increased risk of blood 
clots the committee said 
an estimated 3 million to 4 million women could be affected if 
the fda accepts the committees recommendation to remove the age 
ceiling advisory on pill use by nonsmokers 
panel members noted that their decision was based on little new 
data on incidence of disease among pill users instead it was 
based primarily on informed opinion and the assumption that the 
lower doses prescribed now will carry lower risks 
increased risk of cardiovascular problems including heart 
attack and stroke are the primary concerns for older women on 
birth control pills 
breast cancer has been linked with use of oral contraceptives at 
all ages but not specifically to use by older women hulka said 
adding theres so little data on breast cancer we cant really 
address that 
six of the eight panel members attending the meeting agreed on 
the recommendations a single dissenter susan ar mckay 
associate professor at the university of wyoming school of nursing 
said she could not go along with changing the current caution 
against women over 40 using the pill because i dont think we 
have adequate information 
the national womens health network opposed lifting the age 
ceiling citing inconclusive studies on health risks and saying 
safer contraceptive alternatives are available for this group 
there is no pressing reason to change current prescribing 
practices adriane fughberman of the network told the panel 
judith a fortney an epidemiologist from the family health 
international in durham nc estimated that 3 million to 4 
million women over 40 might be candidates for the pill she cited a 
survey that estimated that as many as 500000 women over 40 now are 
taking the pill but she said she doubts the figure is that high 
of women 40 to 44 using reversible contraception she said 
about 3 percent are using the pill while 35 percent are using 
condoms 19 percent are using intrauterine devices or iuds 13 
percent are using diaphragms and 12 percent are using the rhythm 
method the rest use other forms 
but more women use sterilization which is irreversible than 
all of the reversible methods combined fortney said some of these 
women might have opted for the pill if it were available as an 
option

an agriculture department economist says a 
worldclass foot race could develop among farmers in 1990 to see 
who gets to the fields first if grain supplies tighten further and 
prices go up 
gregory gajewski of the departments economic research service 
said us farmers have millions of idled acres that could be 
brought quickly back into production if prospects brighten 
other countries also have the potential to expand agricultural 
production he said canada the ec european community 
brazil argentina thailand and others could substantially boost 
output if producer prices rose enough 
in the united states land used to grow us crops this year is 
estimated at 342 million acres up 14 million acres from 1988 
gajewski writes in the november issue of agricultural outlook 
magazine 
slightly more than 29 million acres were idled this year under 
the usdas annual crop programs that does not count around 30 
million acres of highly erodible cropland held out of 
production under the longterm conservation reserve program 
should crop supplies tighten further and prices rise the 
acreage idled under the annual programs could quickly return to 
production gajewski said 
but at the moment the need for a large crop production increase 
is in some doubt he added 
wheat exports continue to be subsidized by both the united 
states and the 12nation eec and prices of soybeans and coarse 
grains corn sorghum oats and barley have come down from 
earlier high levels 
moreover such a surge in worldwide production could come at 
some environmental cost gajewski said but the higher prices 
and profits would help farmers absorb the costs of shifting to more 
environmentally sustainable farming practices 
gajewski said the experience of us farmers in the 1970s and 
early 1980s may temper plans for expansion in the near future 
it was a combination of declining supplies and rising commodity 
prices that triggered larger production and a rise in global 
stockpiles of grain 
but world production growth outpaced demand growth in the 
early and mid1980s and stagnating prices touched off the farm 
financial crisis he said land values plummeted as farmers 
returns did not keep up with earlier expectations 
gajewski said that a few years ago us grain surpluses were 
so big that much effort went into devising new ways to store it 
now some analysts are worried about the low levels of food 
reserves 
farm income has risen dramatically from the ebb of the early 
80s after allowing for inflation 1989 income is expected to be 
up about 35 percent from 1984 when farmers were struggling 
through their worst financial crisis since the great depression 
he said 
land values have been rising the last couple of years although 
gajewski noted new survey information showing that farmland prices 
are expected to rise much more slowly in 1990 
because land values embody profits expected for the next decade 
gajewski said the recent slowing could reflect concerns about 
longterm trends in commodity prices new farm legislation due in 
1990 negotiations under the general agreement on tariffs and 
trade and future policies under the 1992 european unity plan 
but he added on a more basic level the slowing likely 
reflects farmers more cautious attitudes following the financial 
crisis earlier this decade

a proposal by president bush to overhaul 
federal pesticide regulations including faster action to take 
chemicals off the market has drawn generally favorable reaction 
from major farm and commodity organizations 
the president said thursday that the plan was partly in response 
to publics concern over stories alleging the presence of 
dangerous levels of pesticides 
while claiming the nations food supply to be safe he said 
some of the publics perception is based on valid concerns about 
the governments slow and cumbersome process for removing 
pesticides from the market 
bush mentioned a high degree of awareness by americans of news 
stories earlier this year on the presence of the cancercausing 
chemical alar on some apples and more recently concern about the 
widespread use of the fungicide ebdc on fruits and vegetables 
dean kleckner president of the american farm bureau federation 
paid tribute to a provision in bushs plan that would impose a 
negligible risk standard on pesticides 
some had advocated a zero tolerance standard which would 
ban all traces of suspected chemicals in food 
those who favor zero tolerance and farmers disarming 
themselves and surrendering to all pests probably wont be happy 
with this kleckner said but they wouldnt be happy with the 
disruptions in the food supply and distribution system that would 
result from such policies either 
five major commodity organizations said in a joint statement 
that they supported bushs effort as a commitment to building 
consumer confidence in our food supply which is already the safest 
food supply in the world 
the statement was issued by the american soybean association 
national association of wheat growers national corn growers 
association national cotton council and us rice producers

congress is taking action in an effort to 
resolve the 8monthold eastern airlines strike 
we are delighted that the senate has approved this 
laborsupported proposal which provides a process that should lead 
to a fair and equitable settlement of the eastern airlines 
strike aflcio president lane kirkland said about thursdays 
vote 
president bush has refused to involve the government in the 
dispute despite his wellestablished power under the railway labor 
act bush has said he wants management and the employees to resolve 
the dispute 
the senate on a 6535 vote approved its version of a bill to 
create a commission to resolve the strike affecting about 30000 
machinists flight attendants and pilots who have been off the job 
since march 3 
the house earlier approved a similar measure 
the senate version would create a fourmember bipartisan 
commission consisting of one house member and one senator from each 
party appointed by the respective party leaders in congress 
fiftyfive senate democrats were joined by 10 republicans in 
supporting the bill no democrats voted against it 
bushs republican allies have tried for almost as long as the 
strike to forestall a vote but senate democrats voted earlier this 
month to close debate 
on thursday sen howard metzenbaum dohio said bushs 
inaction was incomprehensible 
mr president nobody is asking you to come down on the side 
of the workers the strikers metzenbaum said nobody is asking 
you to come down on the side of management 
metzenbaum cited 34 occasions in which presidents have appointed 
emergency boards settling 26 strikes 
the panel created by the senate bill would make recommendations 
on how to settle the strike and make further recommendations on 
maintaining competiveness in the airline industry the panel also 
would make recommendations on how to protect employee collective 
bargaining rights in bankruptcy proceedings involving air carriers 
the report would be due in 45 days after enactment 
five days after the strike began eastern filed for protection 
under the us bankruptcy act the company has continued efforts to 
reorganize in bankruptcy court and has said it plans to emerge as a 
carrier twothirds its former size

mikhail s gorbachevs offer to reduce nuclear 
weapons in the baltic sea carries little military risk for the 
soviets and fits into their plans to reduce global tension and 
justify needed defense cuts at home say bush administration 
officials 
gorbachev faces huge economic problems and needs to reduce 
military spending to help solve them assistant secretary of state 
raymond g seitz said thursday 
and one pentagon source speaking on condition of anonymity 
said the soviets can use nucleararmed ballistic missiles bombers 
or cruise missiles to hit the same european targets as the missiles 
carried aboard the submarines gorbachev proposed eliminating 
gorbachev said the soviet union had removed two golfclass 
submarines from the baltic and would destroy the remaining four by 
the end of the year 
white house spokesman marlin fitzwater said gorbachevs proposal 
made in finland appeared wellintentioned but might require greater 
cuts by the atlantic alliance than by the soviet bloc 
we do not believe nuclearfree zones contribute to security in 
europe he said 
despite the brushoff to the proposed nuclear reduction in the 
baltics the bush administration notified the soviet union it is 
willing to discuss an offer by foreign minister eduard shevardnadze 
to curtail military bases in europe 
we support that aim and are willing to work with them to 
preserve their security through political rather than military 
means the state department said in a statement the statement 
noted that previous proposals have appeared aimed at the 
elimination of us bases on foreign soil which the department 
said we cannot accept 
seitz addressing a conference organized by the washington 
journalism center withheld final judgment of gorbachevs baltics 
statement but he noted that in 1986 and 1987 the soviet leader 
made a number arms control proposals turned out to be sleights of 
hand 
there hasnt been much of this in the last six months or so 
seitz said in the year or two preceding that there was almost 
an arms control initiative a week and a lot of them were made for 
rather propagandist political purposes rather than with the 
serious intention of dealing with the hard arms control issue 
serious arms control proposals made by gorbachev designed to 
cut conventional forces or move forward on a proposed strategic 
arms reduction treaty reflect his need to cut the soviet defense 
budget said seitz 
gorbachev is driven by two considerations the first being the 
sheer weight of military expenditure said seitz 
if you had to pick one single explanation for the huge budget 
deficit in the soviet union and for the arthritic economic pace in 
the soviet union it would be the disproportionate amount of 
military expenditure and that simply has got to be gotten under 
control seitz said 
the soviet military consumes up to 17 percent of gross national 
product about twice the ratio spent by the pentagon according to 
the central intelligence agency that means that because the us 
economy is about twice the size of the soviet the superpowers 
spend about the same amount on defense 
gorbachevs second consideration said seitz has a broader 
political purpose attempting to go through with what is a 
massive effort to restructure not only the soviet economy but 
soviet psychology requires nonthreatening relatively safe 
stable predictable external circumstances so that all the energy 
and attention can be devoted to attempting to change the soviet 
union 
gorbachev addressing a group of finnish politicians and 
businessmen said thursday we are prepared to come to agreement 
with all the nuclear powers and the baltic states on effective 
guarantees for the nuclearfree status of the baltic sea 
according to the pentagon the soviets had four of the aging 
dieselpowered golf2 submarines in the baltic each can deliver 
three ssn5 ballistic missiles on targets in europe according the 
pentagon book soviet military power 
pentagon officials declined to say whether the us military had 
any nuclear weapons in the baltic sea

an earthquake more deadly than last weeks 
jolt is 50 percent likely near san francisco and a catastrophic 
big one is at least 60 percent probable in southern california 
by the year 2018 scientists say 
overall odds for such quakes which could kill thousands of 
people were listed in a 1988 us geological survey study they 
remain unchanged by the oct 17 upheaval that claimed at least 63 
lives in the san francisco bay area said usgs geophysicist jim 
dieterich the reports lead author 
the report predicted a 30 percent chance by 2018 for a magnitude 
65 quake on the segment of the san andreas that caused last weeks 
quake that jolt measured 71 on the richter scale suggesting the 
forecast was conservative 
the earthquake makes one realize these forecasts are serious 
and reliable said california institute of technology geologist 
kerry sieh one of 12 coauthors of the study which represented a 
scientific consensus 
the report said a repeat of san franciscos magnitude 83 great 
earthquake of 1906 is less than 10 percent within 30 years the 
1906 quake ruptured the san andreas fault and killed at least 2500 
people according to recent studies 
the next magnitude 7 major quake will be much more devastating 
than the recent jolt because it will be located closer to the city 
on either the san andreas or hayward faults dieterich and others 
said 
the chance of another destructive or more destructive 
earthquake in the bay area is still high and the chances in 
southern california are even higher sieh said 
the study listed overall 30year probabilities of 50 percent for 
a magnitude 7 quake in the bay area and 60 percent to perhaps 70 
percent odds that the big one measuring 75 to 83 on the 
richter scale will rupture the san andreas fault in southern 
california 
last weeks quake raised the chance of an earthquake on the san 
andreas fault between los gatos and daly city closer to san 
francisco it slightly lowered the chance of a quake on the segment 
south of los gatos which is where last weeks quake was centered 
but the overall odds for a magnitude 7 quake in the bay area 
remain 5050 by 2018 dieterich calculated 
a magnitude 7 earthquake on either the san andreas or the 
hayward faults closer to san francisco would be much more 
devastating than last weeks earthquake dieterich said wednesday 
by telephone from menlo park 
damage for a hayward fault magnitude 7 earthquake would be 
comparable to a great earthquake occurring along the san andreas 
fault in southern california he said the hayward runs right 
through oakland berkeley and the rest of the east bay 
a 1980 report by the federal emergency management agency 
estimated a magnitude 74 quake on the hayward fault could kill 
3000 to 7000 people hospitalize 13000 to 27000 and cause 44 
billion in damage no estimate exists for a magnitude 7 quake 
the same report said a repeat of the 1906 catastrophe could kill 
3000 to 11000 people hospitalize 12000 to 44000 and cause 38 
billion in damage a quake of magnitude 83 in southern california 
could kill 3000 to 14000 people hospitalize 12000 to 55000 and 
cause 17 billion in damage 
everybody who lives in california should be ready for an 
earthquake at any time and that means tomorrow said don 
anderson director of caltechs seismological laboratory just 
because someone says there is a 30 percent probability of a big 
earthquake in the next 30 years doesnt mean it wont happen 
tomorrow

armenian youngsters who survived a 
crippling earthquake in their country relived the horror after 
coming here for treatment of physical and emotional problems 
fifteenyearold gayana kaloustian whose hometown of leninagan 
was heavily damaged in the december 1988 quake in the soviet 
republic said she was more frightened when the bay area quake 
struck oct 17 
i didnt realize what was going on in armenia but i did 
here she said through an interpreter 
but after the quake here ended she said her fears vanished 
because i was waiting for everything to fall down but it 
didnt her right leg was crushed in the armenian quake which 
left thousands dead injured and homeless 
the children are staying at homes of armenians who live in th 
san francisco bay area and are undergoing treatment at the 
shriners hospital here they were flown here by the armenian 
relief society an international organization that collected 5 
million in donations after the armenian quake 
shriners hospital spokeswoman mary murphy said hospital 
staffers and armenianamericans who have the children in their 
homes feel theyre responding very well emotionally theyre 
doing extremely well 
the youngsters are feeling very safe since nothing fell down 
on top of them she said thats what they associate with we 
just had a couple of lights fall on the floor at the hospital look 
at the scene in armenia it was total devastation 
but for many of the children the first reaction to the bay area 
quake was panic 
one boy bolted outdoors and wouldnt enter a building for 
several hours another couldnt eat and others cried expecting the 
worst 
when the earthquake happened here i was very frightened and i 
cried meher pahahlavian 12 said i was so scared i couldnt 
eat 
his 10yearold sister was killed in the 1988 quake which 
leveled their hometown of spitak he was brought here oct 1 for 
treatment of a bone infection that developed from injuries suffered 
when he was trapped in rubble for about two hours 
over there it was horrible he said over there 
everything tumbled down but over here nothing came down i 
wasnt half as scared as i was over there 
still the oct 17 quake and many aftershocks made a big 
impression on the boy when im alone i really worry about 
earthquakes he said but when you guys are with me i seem to 
forget 
soviet psychiatrists who studied the emotional problems of 
armenian quake victims visited the children thursday and said they 
were doing well 
dr yuri alexandrovsky director of the national center for 
neurotic and borderline psychiatric disorders in moscow said 
through an interpreter the kids who experienced the armenian 
earthquake first were shocked much more than kids of similar age in 
america 
they were afraid the houses here couldnt stand the earthquake 
and they were waiting for the roofs to fall down he said 
but they returned to a normal state sooner than american kids 
because the most fear for them was the collapse of buildings 
said alexandrovsky who was one of four soviets here to attend a 
meeting of the international society for the traumatic stress 
studies 
its nice to see the smiling faces of armenian kids because 
it was awful to see the masks of horror on their faces during the 
1988 earthquake when they were taken out of the ruins of their 
houses

the sight of the earthquakecollapsed 
section of interstate 880 had a particularly devastating impact on 
the man who designed the structure in the early 1950s he watched 
it crumble on television 
im looking at a sandwich and theyre looking at a freeway 
clayton r giroux 63 said in an emotional telephone interview 
wednesday with the tribune of oakland 
watching footage filmed from the goodyear blimp when the 
earthquake struck oct 17 giroux knew before newscasters announced 
it that the doubledeck freeway had collapsed 
i said my god the blimp is panning over that and theres 
got to be cars between there he continued i saw that it was 
collapsed and i was horrified 
the days since the tragedy have been particularly trying for 
giroux who has been in seclusion pacing the floor and 
fretting over what he considered one of his greatest engineering 
achievements the states first elevated freeway 
i dont have guilt over it just a stong sense of 
disappointment and tragedy he said i cared very deeply about 
doing a good engineering job and doing a job for an outfit that 
serves people 
giroux retired from the state department of transportation three 
years ago he began his career as a state bridge and highway 
designer in 1948 
amid the flurry of criticism that the freeway was not built to 
the engineering standards of its day giroux defended his creation 
we were very proud of what we did he said 
groux went on to explain that engineers included several 
structural details in the design that quake experts now believe 
contributed to the freeways collapse 
steel hoops were placed in the structures concrete columns to 
stabilize the support system but they ultimately make the pillars 
vulnerable to buckling and collapse experts say numerous 
crisscrossed ties are now used 
the fraternity of engineers never knew that earthquakes 
behaved in a way that would burst these columns giroux said

the bush administration says it wont mind if 
congress forgives interest and penalties on an obscure liquor tax 
that many tavern and restaurant owners on the deadbeat list say 
theyve never heard of 
a treasury department official told a house ways and means 
subcommittee thursday that the administration does not oppose a 
house plan to erase interest and penalties that accrued before july 
on the 123yearold tax 
but kenneth w gideon assistant treasury secretary for tax 
policy stopped short of endorsing a waiver of the tax debts 
themselves 
protests over the tax grew after a pennsylvania elks lodge got a 
9776 bill last year for 50 years of nonpayment and a california 
pizza shop owner received a 2911 bill four weeks ago 
owners of both establishments said they had never heard of the 
special occupational tax on liquor retailers 
about 600000 beer wine and distilled spirits dealers who sell 
directly to the public must pay the annual tax which was increased 
in january 1988 from 54 to 250 per retailer 
accompanying the increase has been a vigorous enforcement effort 
by the bureau of alcohol tobacco and firearms which took 
responsibility for collections from the internal revenue service in 
1986 
although we continue to believe that taxpayer amnesty programs 
are generally inappropriate this case involves a tax that for 
years before 1987 was insignificant and not well publicized 
gideon said in prepared testimony before the subcommittee on select 
revenue measures 
it appears that noncompliance in years before 1987 was due to 
the fact that many taxpayers were simply not aware of the tax 
there is no evidence that dealers were attempting to avoid the 
tax 
only about 40 percent of retailers paid before 1987 gideon 
said adding that the compliance rate has risen to 80 percent 
rep ed jenkins dga proposed earlier that interest and 
penalties on the tax accruing before july be forgiven rep paul 
kanjorski dpa told the subcommittee thursday that it should 
also forgive tax debts on the books before 1985 
the national restaurant association and the national grocers 
association which blamed the large debts on lax enforcement by the 
government backed kanjorskis approach 
it was in kanjorskis district that elks lodge 109 of 
wilkesbarre pa received a 977698 tax bill the lodge settled 
for less than onetenth that amount after saying it had not been 
open and functioning for part of the period for which it was 
charged

advisers are recommending that energy 
secretary james d watkins order a longer test period before 
opening the nations first permanent dump for longlived 
radioactive waste from nuclear weapons plants 
the proposed changes if accepted by watkins would force the 
energy department to arrange temporary storage of nuclear 
wastes for a much longer period than planned said leonard slosky 
one of five members of a blueribbon advisory group watkins 
impaneled two months ago to study the problem 
watkins already is having trouble persuading any of seven 
selected states washington idaho nevada colorado new mexico 
tennessee and south carolina to store extra nuclear weapons waste 
for about 2 years starting in april 
the waste had been going to idaho but gov cecil andrus banned 
further shipments sept 1 watkins had hoped to have a permanent 
dump opened in new mexico by now but environmental and other 
problems have delayed it indefinitely 
watkins told congress earlier this month that he expected to 
start operations demonstration of the permanent waste dump 
known as the waste isolation pilot plant by september 1992 that 
would involve loading shipping unloading depositing and 
retrieving drums of the nuclear waste to demonstrate that the 
system the first of its kind in the world can work safely 
the plant is near carlsbad nm 
on tuesday however four of the five advisory panel members 
told watkins in a private meeting that the operational testing 
should be put off for at least four years slosky said thursday 
that would mean the dump could take only a small amounts of 
waste equal to about 1 percent of its capacity for the next four 
or five years said slosky an environmental scientist based in 
denver 
robert bishop representing a nuclear industry group said he 
was the lone dissenter on the advisory group he added however 
that all members agreed the energy departments plans for opening 
the repository are probably too optimistic 
rep david skaggs dcolo said in an interview that the 
advisory groups conclusions would intensify the political pressure 
on watkins to solve the waste problem 
it removes any pretense that the operational testing was 
anything other than a device for getting waste into the ground 
to relieve the waste storage problem skaggs said 
the panel wrote no joint report but instead the members 
presented their own recommendations in separate papers for watkins 
on tuesday slosky and bishop said in telephone interviews 
energy department officials familiar with the reports did not 
return a reporters phone calls thursday the department has not 
published the papers 
an environmental group said in response to the advisory panels 
recommendations that watkins faced further delays and political 
fights over the dump 
for political and technical reasons its not going to open 
any time soon said elizabeth kassen a senior lawyer for the 
environmental defense fund 
the panel members also told watkins they saw serious management 
problems that should be corrected before the dump is opened 
in his written report to watkins slosky stressed the importance 
of completing tests to show the repository can handle the wastes 
and remove them in the first few years if major problems are 
discovered 
however given the current degree of uncertainty regarding the 
ability of the repository to meet regulatory requirements it is 
not prudent to transport large quantities of waste to the site

the international association of fire chiefs 
is trying to make the american ritual of resetting the clocks into 
an annual lifesaving event 
the occasion is the switch from daylight to standard time which 
occurs officially at 2 am sunday 
for the record turn the clock back one hour 
for all but a few americans this is an event they cannot ignore 
without the risk of being an hour early for everything until next 
spring 
the fire chiefs are promoting it as an occasion to make sure 
they are safe as well as on time by putting a new battery in smoke 
detectors 
change your clock change your battery is the simple 
message 
while 80 percent of the homes in america have smoke detectors 
as many as half dont work because the batteries are either old or 
missing a lack of the warning that smoke detectors can give is a 
major factor in fire deaths and injuries fire chiefs say 
while people are concerned about fires and will buy and install 
smoke detectors its easy to forget about them the chiefs warn 
and the batteries will die eventually leaving the home unprotected 
checking and replacing batteries is also a good idea in states 
where the clocks dont have to be changed those few which didnt 
change to daylight time in the spring include arizona hawaii 
parts of indiana puerto rico the virgin islands and american 
samoa

the bush administration is leading the charge 
for german reunification an issue that conjures up memories of 
world war ii and makes some of the allies in western europe quite 
nervous 
the division of 80 million people between east and west was 
never likely to be permanent but the liberalization that soviet 
president mikhail s gorbachev has fostered in eastern and central 
europe and a flood of east german refugees puts the issue on 
the front burner 
president bush dealt with it this week in an interview with rw 
apple jr of the new york times and he did not hedge 
i dont share the concern that some european countries have 
about a reunified germany because i think germanys commitment to 
and recognition of the importance of the alliance is unsinkable 
he said 
bush was referring to trends to neutralism among the german 
people many of whom recoil in horror from what they heard or 
remember about world war ii and from the nuclear age it ushered in 
i dont see germany in order to get reunification going off 
into what some are concerned about and that is a neutralist path 
that puts them at odds or potentially at odds with their nato 
partners bush said 
referring carefully to the unspeakable helmut sonnenfeldt a 
berlinborn analyst and former state department official said 
recently if one means reestablishing the previous german reich 
even in a somewhat smaller territory i think that is probably not 
in the cards for any time soon 
but sonnenfeldt said i think there is a lot of concern in 
europe about the reconstitution of something that resembles the 
previous united germany that existed from 1871 on and especially in 
the hitlerian period 
burton yale pines senior vice president and director of 
research at the heritage foundation said thursday that only we 
can devise a framework in which a united germany can emerge that 
does not terrify its neighbors eastern and western 
west germany has been a member of the north atlantic treaty 
organization since 1955 its admission to the usled alliance 
against the soviet union confirmed its acceptance as a democracy 
and also marked recognition of german rearmament 
the turnabout since hitler plunged the world in 1939 into the 
worst war in recorded history and set about to exterminate jews 
and other undesirables was complete 
only turkey within nato has a larger armed force 600000 
strong like the germans the turks also confront the soviet union 
visiting washington a few weeks ago manfred woerner the former 
west german defense minister who is now natos secretary general 
predicted nato will continue to exist with changes 
he even saw merit in the survival of the sovietled warsaw pact 
calling it a force for stability 
and yet east germany may be catching the democratic fever some 
60000 of its citizens have fled to west germany and those who 
stayed behind want a better life they need only to look to hungary 
to know it is possible within the warsaw pact 
egon krentz the new east german chief of state was viewed 
initially as an antireformer now some analysts are not so sure 
he appealed tuesday for public support in overcoming an economic 
and refugee crisis young and old we must all work together 
he said 
if the lines between east and west begin to blur so also might 
the division of the two germanys and with it could go both nato 
and the warsaw pact 
secretary of state james a baker iii asked monday after a 
speech in san francisco about the german question replied when 
we talk about that were talking about selfdetermination for the 
peoples of east germany achieved in peace and freedom so that 
the people of east germany ultimately will be integrated into a 
community of democratic european nations 
baker did not specify how this could be accomplished but he 
acknowledged that the word reunification conjures up visions of 
a return to 1937 borders or perhaps a reunification that is not 
achieved through peace and freedom

almost 32 billion to step up the war on 
drugs is moving forward again in congress after agreement between 
house and senate negotiators 
the money represents the major congressional contribution to the 
war that was launched by president bush on sept 5 but appeared 
stalled since the plan cleared the senate on sept 27 
a housesenate conference committee on thursday reached 
agreement on the funds which bring to 88 billion the total 
commitment to the campaign against narcotics 900 million more 
than the administration initially sought 
the house accepted overall funding levels for the war on drugs 
contained in an 119 billion transportation bill the senate 
approved sept 27 
floor action on the bill in the house is expected tuesday it 
was not immediately certain when the senate plans to vote on the 
measure 
the senate accepted a house proposal to change the way lawmakers 
will cut other programs to pay for the drug war 
as approved by the senate the bill called for a 043 percent 
cut in programs throughout the government but only 03 percent of 
it across the board congressional subcommittees were to make 
adjustments in programs to get the rest of the money thus avoiding 
excessive cuts in defense 
the plan agreed upon by the conferees would give the 
congressional subcommittees more freedom to choose what would be 
cut 
the compromise also dropped 60 pages of drugfighting program 
authorizations that the senate harnessed to the money bill 
the package included measures ranging from requiring each state 
to have a drugfighting plan to programs that would pave the way 
for assistance to cocaproducing nations in the andes 
house members said the authorizations dealing with substantive 
programs had no business on an appropriation bill 
speaker thomas foley dwash sent a letter to senate majority 
leader george mitchell dmaine promising that the house would 
deal with the authorizations later 
rep lawrence coughlin rpa questioned the leader of senate 
conferees appropriations committee chairman robert c byrd 
dwva on whether the house would be allowed to vote on the 
measures sought by the president in unaltered form 
i accept the assurances of the leadership byrd said 
coughlin said afterward though that he remained worried that 
the presidents programs might come to the house floor packaged 
with additional items unpalatable to republicans and lord only 
knows what 
or the presidents program would be so limited and watered 
down he added 
before the conferees acted national drug control policy 
director william j bennett had criticized congress slow pace in 
acting on the presidents proposal

president bushs plan to improve pesticide 
regulation is being criticized in congress as doing nothing to make 
food safer but praised for promoting needed bureaucratic 
improvements 
the president deserves credit for reforming the outdated and 
extremely cumbersome procedures for removing dangerous pesticides 
from use rep henry waxman dcalif said thursday but 
better procedures are meaningless if the safety standards are 
weakened 
the presidents proposal offers absolutely no assurances that 
our food will be free of dangerous pesticides he said 
waxman chairman of the house energy and commerce subcommittee 
on health and the environment has introduced legislation of his 
own to reform pesticide use and said he would consider bushs 
proposal during hearings within the next three weeks 
waxmans bill is among several in congress that have various 
plans for regulating the way chemicals are used in farming 
bushs proposal includes 
redefining the criteria to be used for temporarily removing or 
suspending from use a pesticide that poses a possible health 
hazard making it easier to get the chemical off the market even 
though formal proceedings might still be under way 
streamlining the procedures under which a dangerous pesticide 
may be permanently removed from the market officials said the 
process would reduce by at least half the fourtoeight years it 
often takes for a chemical to be banned 
providing tougher enforcement against misuse of pesticides 
including a proposal to increase penalties from 5000 per day to 
25000 per day 
president bushs proposal will enhance the governments 
ability to remove potentially hazardous pesticides from the 
marketplace said rep norman lent rny ranking republican on 
the energy and commerce committee 
in the senate agriculture committee chairman patrick leahy 
criticized bushs plan 
the administration is taking one step forward and two steps 
back when it weakens important food safety protections in exchange 
for some procedural improvements in pesticide regulations said 
leahy dvt 
sen joseph i lieberman dconn a member of the senate 
environment and public works committee likened the bush proposal 
to an impressionist painting 
the closer you get to it the fuzzier it looks he said 
lawmakers complain about bushs proposal to increase the risk 
level allowed before a pesticide is removed from the market waxman 
said that under the plan cancer risks of chemicals used on crops 
could be as high as 1 in 10000 
this is 100 times greater than the food and drug 
administration says is acceptable waxman said 
sen edward kennedy dmass said it was unacceptable that 
the administration is proposing to weaken current federal health 
and safety standards and then prohibit states from setting higher 
standards themselves 
uniform pesticide standards are needed for international trade 
purposes said agriculture secretary clayton yeutter 
state governments should not have a standard that is different 
from those of the federal government he said 
dean kleckner president of the american farm bureau federation 
said bushs plan was a workable approach that would make the 
worlds safest food supply even safer

the us congress wants to lend a helping hand 
to its fledgling counterpart in poland by providing the hardware 
and software of westernstyle democracy 
the senate late thursday approved a resolution that will send a 
team of congressional experts to poland to study the needs of the 
newly formed parliament they will come up with an aid package that 
includes everything from telephones and typewriters to training in 
how to write laws 
while were talking about the bigger issues of loan 
stabilization of economic reform of food aid it is quite 
appropriate for congress to give this as a first gift of 
democracy said sen pete domenici a sponsor of the initiative 
polands first open elections since before world war ii held in 
april gave the country its first noncommunistdominated 
government in four decades but the newly elected lawmakers many 
of them workers with no previous experience in government soon 
found they had inherited an empty shell of a legislature domenici 
said 
used only to rubberstamp decisions of previous communist 
governments the parliament has no mechanism for drafting laws or 
even keeping track of laws already on the books there is no 
organizational structure like the us congress system of 
committees there are no workable rules of procedure for the sejm 
the lower house or the newly created senate 
domenici and a group of former us lawmakers went to poland in 
september to meet with a select group of the new legislators 
including members of the nowdominant solidarity party and other 
parties 
the new elected officials are bright able and motivated he 
said one is a manager at a tractor factory another a physician at 
the gdansk shipyards another a college professor and another a 
union leader the group probably had more experience in organizing 
protests than in governing many had spent time in jail under the 
old regime 
we thought we were going to talk about economics how you 
create a capitalist system domenici rnm said in an 
interview they were interested in that but they really wanted 
to know how to run a parliament 
it boiled down to basics how do you gather information how 
do you get sufficient informationgathering equipment to keep track 
of your laws they have no library system no simple computer 
system no copying machines they dont have a system of producing 
reports 
so while we talked about a lot of philosophical things 
they need some of the basic equipment that we take for granted 
domenici said when the group which included former sens walter 
mondale thomas eagleton and howard baker and former rep james 
jones suggested it could come up with some help they were just 
ecstatic said domenici 
congress in the next few months will send aides familiar with 
computers legislative research and parliamentary procedure to 
poland to inventory training and equipment needs congress then 
will seek donations from the us private sector to get the new 
senate and sejm started 
domenici acknowledged he has gotten some ribbing for wanting to 
share abroad the expertise of congress which is not exactly noted 
at home for its own efficiency but he said there will be no 
courses on how to avoid meeting budget targets or how to cut 
porkbarrel deals 
i know some might look at how we conduct our business and say 
we sure dont want to pass that over to poland but when you look 
at this brandnew democracy that has such tremendous respect for 
the united states of america it seems to me that this is a rare 
opportunity to at least say we care

hoarding of disaster relief food 
clothing and other supplies prompted officials at a relief center 
to require the needy to obtain vouchers from an agency four miles 
away 
until wednesdays crackdown the donated items were passed out 
to anyone who asked at the salvation armys downtown relief center 
the system angered some volunteers 
i cant believe it this is absurd said antoinette pilz a 
volunteer from the church of the highlands in south san francisco 
youve got to trust people there is enough food in watsonville 
to feed the entire city for two months 
but officials said the system will continue with the needy 
required to go to the federal emergency management agency 
headquarters in the northern section of town for the vouchers 
we will continue to do vouchers now said lt clayton 
gardner of the salvation armys downtown relief center we are 
concerned we will go down to salinas this weekend and find half our 
stuff being sold at the flea market 
gardner and others complained that some residents had loaded up 
on much more donated clothing and other items than they could 
possibly use the display of greed prompted the security crackdown 
making it difficult for the people the agencies are trying to serve 
city councilman dennis osmer said there was undoubtedly some 
stockpiling of relief goods 
we do have a lot of hoarding but if people are hoarding and 
we give out four times what they need we have four times what they 
need lets give it to them osmer said 
some people were turned away at the downtown relief center 
thursday morning if they didnt have the proper papers 
we realize a lot of these people wont go to the disaster 
assistance center because they are illegal aliens but we want 
these people to see the wealth of services available to them and 
getting them there is the only way to do it said gardner who 
conceded the system had caused hardship 
a spanishspeaking woman carrying two young children asked a 
volunteer for a toy and was told she needed a voucher 
it was a giveaway it got to the point where the red cross and 
the military started to control that and now people that really 
need it are given the runaround and given a hard time said jose 
luis fernandez division director at california employment training 
here 
volunteer ed vasquez said the city no longer wanted quake 
refugees living in tents the city estimates 1200 people were left 
homeless by the quake while the salvation army claims there are 
closer to 4000 or 5000 living oudoors 
the idea is getting them to go to fema to find out whats 
available said vasquez we recognize many are going to be 
intimidated by going to a federal agency we are just trying to 
make a human effort to get them back in some kind of shelter 
one of the unauthorized migrant camps that have sprung up since 
the quake is at callaghan park where 250 people are living in 
tents and being cared for by salude para la gente a state and 
federally funded hispanic outreach group 
at the park mattresses are set up on wooden pallets to keep 
rainwater from soaking people or belongings the spicy scent of 
chili peppers wafted from barbeques a large green millitary tent 
stored the communitys supply of food 
democratic state sens henry melo of watsonville and art torres 
of los angeles toured the callaghan camp thursday and assured 
residents there would be no check on citizenship 
fema and other relief agenies are here to provide humanitarian 
aid and are not interested in asking about citizenship status

treasury secretary nicholas f brady is 
disputing the new securities and exchange commission chiefs 
contention that the sec doesnt need the power to halt trading in 
stock market emergencies 
testifying before a senate panel in support of proposed market 
reform legislation brady said thursday taht the bush 
administration supports giving the sec emergency powers to suspend 
or halt trading for up to 24 hours 
one day earlier sec chairman richard c breeden told a house 
panel he neither wanted nor needed the emergency power one of four 
changes originally proposed by the sec in the wake of the 1987 
stock market crash 
brady declined to comment further on his testimony after the 
hearing before the senate banking housing and urban affairs 
committee 
breeden on the job just two weeks said through a spokeswoman 
late thursday that he had no comment 
on wednesday breeden said safety mechanisms called 
circuitbreakers automatic temporary trading halts in times of 
market volatility have eliminated much of the need for officials 
to halt trading 
breeden told the telecommunications and finance subcommittee of 
the house energy and commerce committee that he believed the 
possibility of arbitrary halts could cause uncertainty and 
volatility in the markets the power to make such a decision should 
remain where it is now with the president he contended 
brady in a letter accompanying his testimony said however 
that he believed the change is needed 
the initial governmental response to market emergencies should 
come from a regulator with expertise and proximity to the 
markets brady said 
brady noted that the proposed legislation still gives the 
president power to terminate sec emergency actions and would 
require presidential approval for any trading halt longer than 24 
hours 
in other testimony brady backed away from a recommendation made 
by a commission he headed that investigated the 1987 crash when the 
dow jones industrial average a key market indicator dropped more 
than 500 points in one day brady said his crash study may have 
overreacted in calling for a superregulator to oversee all the 
financial markets 
in his first testimony to congress since the 190point plunge in 
the dow jones industrial average oct 13 brady said the turmoil 
had not altered his belief in the soundness of the us economy 
but it did point out the need for further changes in market 
regulation he said 
brady suggested giving the sec authority to request reports on 
large securities and options trades as well as rules for assessing 
the financial soundness of the parent holding companies of 
brokerdealers 
legislation making such changes with minor variations is 
before the house 
a january 1988 report on the previous octobers 508point stock 
market crash the presidential task force on market mechanisms 
headed by brady recommended that one agency should coordinate all 
the financial markets that recommendation was one of several never 
acted upon by the reagan administration 
given the different political constituencies of the various 
market regulators the sec the commodity futures trading 
commission and the federal reserve board i dont believe thats 
a practical possibility said brady

earthquake survivor julio berumen has 
been flooded with donations toys and getwell cards but the 
6yearold boy still cries out for the one thing no one can give 
him his mother 
she died within inches of him when the upper deck of the nimitz 
freeway slammed down on their car in last weeks earthquake 
rescuers had to amputate julios right leg to free him from the 
wreckage and while doctors believe that julio and his 8yearold 
sister cathy will survive their injuries friends of the 
closeknit family are hoping the quake did not kill the childrens 
bright spirits 
when julios firstgrade teacher brought a toy to him at the 
hospital this week he started crying said the teacher 
manuela knight 
he was probably wondering why is my teacher coming to see me 
and not my mother knight said thursday 
she said julio was everybodys friend in her class spunky 
confident and obviously the product of a warm and supportive 
family 
i saw him tuesday and hes not the same little boy but i hope 
his spirit comes back she said 
when the quake struck julio and cathy were riding home from the 
orthodontist with their mother petra berumen and a family friend

an fda biologist says an italian scientists 
genetic alteration of the whooping cough bacteria is a reasonable 
candidate for use in upcoming tests on children in the search for a 
safer vaccine 
its a significant and exciting step charles r manclark 
said thursday about rino rappuolis recent findings 
but manclark who runs the laboratory where the food and drug 
administration studies pertussis or whooping cough said he didnt 
think it could be called a major breakthrough because tests on 
children are months away 
rappuoli said in a telephone interview from the sclavo research 
center in siena italy that he had discovered a nontoxic vaccine 
that doesnt appear to cause the side effects sometimes associated 
with the current vaccine yet it still protects against the disease 
widespread vaccination keeps whooping cough from affecting many 
children in the united states but it causes 1 million deaths a 
year and affects 60 million infants worldwide 
most us children are vaccinated before age 3 usually at the 
same time they receive vaccines for diphtheria and typhoid 
pertussis is the p in the dpt shots given to infants 
although the vaccine is credited with keeping the incidence of 
the disease to around 4000 cases a year in the united states some 
medical officials link it to cases of brain damage in some 
children other medical experts say no evidence exists showing that 
the vaccine is responsible for neurological disorders 
some lawsuits allege neurological disorders were caused by the 
vaccine and some parents have refused to let their children be 
immunized 
the current vaccine is made from whole pertussis bacteria cells 
that have been killed rappuoli along with us researchers has 
been trying to find a way to eliminate the toxic effects of the 
vaccine while retaining the portion of the dead bacteria that 
causes the patient to develop immunity to the disease 
rappuoli using genetic engineering altered the bacteria to 
develop multiple mutants that he said no longer include the toxic 
portions but still provided immunity for mice in the study 
such molecules are ideal for the development of new and safer 
vaccines against whooping cough said the research published in 
todays issue of science the journal of the american association 
for the advancement of science 
manclark said the fda is trying to determine a test site for 
clinical studies for the new vaccine those studies cant take 
place in the united states because the disease is not widespread 
enough he said adding that denmark germany italy england and 
thailand are potential sites

theres more to getting past the killer 
earthquake that hit this area oct 17 than going to the world 
series and telling victims to go back to normal an expert on 
stress says 
government agencies dealing with earthquake victims must be 
especially careful and use common sense and wisdom added dr 
yael danieli president of the international society for traumatic 
stress studies 
take your time she advised local state and federal 
agencies these are people whose lives are in shambles right in 
front of their eyes 
just to have an understanding attitude in itself would already 
make people feel different said dr danieli wisdom seems to 
be the casualty of bureaucratic stressful response 
dr danieli a clinical psychologist who has done extensive 
research on holocaust victims said there are big differences 
between manmade and natural disasters 
but what victims in general potentially have in common is 
a conspiracy of silence she said that is victims are allowed 
to be victims for a little while then youre supposed to go back 
to normal whatever that means 
after extraordinary events normal changes its meaning she 
said but then the instruction spoken or unspoken is shut up 
already go back to normal the past is the past bygones are 
bygones get down to business go on with the business of living 
go to the baseball game continue with the world series you 
survived what do you have to complain about 
the problem with that is the continuing impact of the grief 
and the rage and the fear and the nightmares and the worry about 
the next day she said 
thats tough to bear alone and victims potentially very often 
wind up feeling very isolated very alienated and in fact made to 
feel crazy because how come theyre still afraid how come they 
still want to cry how come theyre still afraid to feel and this 
all victims share in common 
dr danieli said talk of the sort scheduled at her 
organizations meeting here is valuable because the more you 
talk the more you dont need to reexperience without words 
the more you talk means the more you have people around you 
you dont feel as lonely and you dont feel as scared she said 
we believe in talking we believe in the value of talking and 
sharing 
some 500 visiting psychologists psychiatrists and other experts 
in stress are attending the societys annual meeting here and the 
agenda was quickly changed to allow for an open forum to discuss 
the quake and its impact on people 
a local newspaper poll has sugested that three out of five san 
francisco bay area residents are having emotional difficulties 
because of the earthquake including sleeplessness nervousness 
irritability difficulty in concentration and depression

city walkers tired of drivers nearly running 
them down and garbage scattered in their paths now can unite for 
safer and cleaner sidewalks 
the recently formed pedestrian council the second private 
advocacy group for walkers in north america intends to make 
philadelphia more walkable by challenging drivers who stop their 
vehicles in crosswalks seeking wider sidewalks and making sure 
streets have enough trash bins 
it will lobby city government for stricter enforcement of laws 
that affect pedestrians and push to make new developments easier 
for walkers said john higgins executive director of the 
foundation for architecture the nonprofit group that formed the 
council 
the council will name 20 board members at its first meeting in 
midnovember higgins said 
whats clear is that the interests of pedestrians are not the 
focus for either public or private decisionmakers higgins said 
we want to build some understanding of what pedestrians rights 
are 
the only other similar group is in ottawa ontario said 
patricia archibald who organizes an annual convention in boulder 
colo of city planners architects and others responsible for 
making cities better places to walk in 
the ottawa group is called ottawalk executive director chris 
bradshaw said the group lobbies on behalf of pedestrians and 
promotes walking as an alternative to driving 
ottawalk formed 19 months ago has 55 members who paid 10 each 
to join 
the prowalking movement in ottawa wasnt taken too seriously at 
first bradshaw said but city officials are beginning to listen as 
more walkers speak up 
its really hard to find two or three pedestrians you can rub 
together and say lets do something about it he said the 
main reaction is they have to shake their head and say is this for 
real 
the pedestrian council in philadelphia doesnt plan on holding 
membership drives but it is seeking money 
the group is off to a good first step the state department of 
community affairs awarded it a oneyear 25000 grant 
the philadelphia council has several items on its agenda 
pedestrian safety sidewalk vendors landscaping and seating 
noise garbage bins sidewalk encroachments by businesses and 
access for the handicapped 
and like the ottawa group it would like to see a major change 
in the making of cars 
bradshaw said strides have been made on auto safety with padded 
dashboards and seat belts but little has been done to change the 
design of auto bodies to make them less dangerous for pedestrians 
we assume cars only hit other cars or objects larger than 
itself we never assume it will hit a 4yearold child or a 
policeman directing traffic he said what about the blind 
person whos walking on the sidewalk the poor person who cant 
afford a car the mother whos walking a stoller they didnt ask 
to get into a world where a 2000pound hunk of metal is careening 
around

french designers sent a message in their fashion 
shows over the last week that women for 1990 should be free 
feminine and sexy 
gone are the tailored power suits and the frilly littlegirl 
poufs that came out in the 1980s as a reaction to masculine 
tailoring female glamour now reigns 
the parisian shows to display next summers styles ended 
wednesday 
the spotlight was on the bosom in slashed decolletes and 
plunging suit lapels some jackets were even flopping open to nude 
breasts at chanel and saint laurent 
heartshaped necklines and curvy tulip jackets and skirts 
contributed to the female silhouette the slim waist was often 
girdled or sashed in its place 
beautiful boleros swallowtails and trapeze tops contributed to 
the latest glamorous looks 
shoulders have softened up for next springs rounded contours 
though discreet padding still gives shape in many outfits 
especially at givenchy and yves saint laurent 
for evening offtheshoulder tight and lowcut bustier tops 
backless and sometimes frontless styles were paraded 
another paris motto for next summer legs are made for walking 
in the new young miniskirts hot pants and flared shorts 
they were best done with braidpiped hems waistbands and 
pockets by karl lagerfeld at chanel who aimed his talents at a 
whole new youth market for the traditionally elegant house 
cyclers tights were popular on the catwalks but are 
forgettable for women over 14 and the many slim skirts to the knee 
looked almost stodgy 
more contemporary and to the point were asymmetrical 
drapedfront sarong or wrapped skirts especially done by masters 
like saint laurent or karl lagerfeld at chanel 
long sheer crepe or chiffon pleated pantskirts or flared pajamas 
were prettier than ever for sporty moments cropped wide pants 
will be a big item 
the fabric combination of transparentopaque is a great teaser 
for next summer its well done as wispy little draped skirts with 
strong long jackets or the reverse as transparent billowy tops 
over a solid skirt or pants 
some themes to remember 
animal prints seem to be permanent residents in the fashion 
zoo but talented designers like christian lacroix and jeanlouis 
scherrer manage to keep the old cats spry 
safari styles with bush jackets sometimes combining with 
baremidriffed sarongs rather than the usual skirts or shorts were 
another paris favorite 
fabrics have never been more softly feminine linen has a 
softly textured appeal or becomes nearly as sheer as voile cool 
wools are caressably soft and light along with cotton poplin and 
jerseys gossamerlight georgette crepes fluttered around the 
runways 
organza is the hottest highstyle summer fabric memorable in 
the huge bows at dior and in cloudlike flounces and duster toppers 
all over a fresh white organza blouse or two should be any womans 
romantic staple for summer 
chiffon also known as mousseline wafted out in several shaded 
layers for iridescence 
pique and cotton quilting looked especially fine at lacroix 
indian silks satin lace and brocades took a back seat to the 
lighter fabrics but were still striking 
colors for summer take off from classics of navy with blazing 
white lapels blackandwhite and gray going into the spicy shades 
of curry and cinnamon plus khaki and cafe au lait or chocolate 
contrasting with the sobriety were dusky pastels celadon 
violet wisteria peach raspberry forest green and the stronger 
shades like mimosa yellow cornflower blue tomato shocking pink 
lacroixs cheery cotton heartsandstars prints were adorable 
and he still makes outsized houndstooth checks look good in dressy 
street wear 
diors smaller checks were interesting valentino lacroix and a 
few others showed glen and tartan plaids outsized polka and 
pindots were still fine in peppy outfits everywhere from dior to 
saint laurent 
ungaros garden of prints toned down to prettier shades than 
last year otherwise floral motifs were simply sweet or big and 
bold 
hats and headdresses were less weird than usual a few boaters 
a top hat at dior gardenparty sun hats pillboxes and several 
types of sailor hats topped off the clothes 
lowheeled or flat pumps sandals biking and tennistype shoes 
often shown with black or white tights were sensible but not 
clumpy highheeled pumps and sandals gave finesse to the sexier 
lateday wear

federal obscenity prosecution statistics 
suggest that the justice department is focusing more of its 
antismut efforts on child pornography rather than on material that 
involves adults 
the figures show a sharp drop in the last two years in the 
number of federal indictments for violations of federal obscenity 
laws while childpornography charges soared during the same time 
period 
indictments for federal obscenity violations dropped from 66 in 
1987 to 37 last year according to figures compiled by the 
departments national obscenity enforcement unit 
the figures may not be complete because us attorneys are not 
required to report obscenity prosecutions said spokesman joseph 
krovisky 
but fbi figures reflect a similar trend 
the number of obscenity cases pending at the bureau dropped from 
355 in 1987 to 302 in 1988 and to 194 in the first nine months of 
the 1989 fiscal year which ended sept 30 
federal childpornography prosecutions meanwhile jumped from 
281 in 1987 to 406 last year according to the obscenity units 
figures 
in a speech to the religious alliance against pornography on 
thursday attorney general dick thornburgh pledged to attack all 
forms of illegal pornography including material depicting sexual 
acts by adults 
but the attorney general repeatedly emphasized he considered 
child pornography the most offensive of all and cautioned that 
officials must be sensitive to first amendment protections 
pornography to me is degrading to human dignity in every form 
but it is most degrading to the human dignity of those who are 
innocent and defenseless and who are preyed upon by criminal 
actors thornburgh said 
we must be attentive to the preservation of first amendment 
rights just as we are attentive to the enforcement of laws that 
attack those practices that lie outside the area of first amendment 
protection 
when the obscenity unit was created in 1987 by thornburghs 
predecessor edwin meese iii civil libertarians complained that 
its prosecutions would infringe on constitutional rights 
before the unit was organized there were very few obscenity 
prosecutions against distributors or makers of hardcore adult 
pornography said john weston a los angeles attorney who 
represents distributors of xrated material 
law enforcement officials say that prosecutions of obscenity 
cases are sensitive because of the constitutional claims 
thornburgh noted difficulties in making obscenity charges stick 
a federal judge in los angeles this year dismissed eight obscenity 
counts against an accused pornographer because he couldnt identify 
a prevailing community standard in the city 
but the defendant rubin gottesman was convicted of a 
childpornography violation because a minor appeared as an actress 
in many of the videos he distributed thornburgh said 
gottesman was sentenced last week to a year in prison and fined 
100000 
thornburgh told the conference that he had asked congress for 
more money to increase the size of the obscenity unit spokesman 
david runkel said later that thornburgh had requested congress add 
one person to the 20member unit

nasa restored full contact with voyager 
1 after the space probe stopped sending data to earth this week 
the first such malfunction since it was launched in 1977 to explore 
jupiter and saturn 
were relieved of course but now theres the question of why 
did it happen and is it going to happen again john tullius 
senior mission controller for voyagers 1 and 2 at the national 
aeronautics and space administrations jet propulsion laboratory 
said thursday 
but flight engineering manager lanny miller said the partial 
loss of contact wasnt too worrisome because engineers were 
confident of their ability to correct the malfunction 
the voyagers were launched from florida in 1977 they explored 
jupiter in 1979 voyager 1 explored saturn in 1980 followed in 
1981 by voyager 2 which went on to study uranus in 1986 and 
neptune in august the twin spacecraft learned so much that 
scientists have been forced to revise astronomy textbooks 
both probes are continuing their mission searching for the edge 
of the solar system where solar wind yields to interstellar wind 
and returning data about magnetic fields and electrically charged 
particles in space barring any unforeseen failure they are 
expected to send information back to earth until 2015 or 2020 
controllers never lost voyager 1s carrier signal a single 
tone that allows them to track the probes location which is now 
above the plane of the solar system some 37 billion miles from 
earth 
but sometime between 6 am and 4 pm pdt monday voyager 1 
stopped sending its telemetry signal which transmits 
scientific data collected by the probe and information about how 
the spacecraft is functioning tullius said 
at noon tuesday engineers sent commands to reset voyager 1s 
telemetry modulation unit ordering it to start working again 
even at the 186000milepersecond speed of light the commands 
took 5 hours to reach the spacecraft it took the same amount of 
time for voyager to confirm the commands worked so it was after 11 
pm tuesday when engineers knew full contact was restored tullius 
said 
until then there was concern wed only have one spacecraft 
left out of the two tullius said voyager 1 is very dear to us 
too 
although engineers at times have shut off voyager telemetry 
signals intentionally this weeks partial loss of contact was the 
first time it has happened accidentally he added 
the cause is under investigation but tullius said a cosmic ray 
may have hit the telemetry unit or a circuit simply malfunctioned 
because of age 
a radio station sends out a single tone but modulates it to 
transmit music of different tones miller said voyager 1s 
telemetry modulator adds or subtracts voltage to the probes 
singletone carrier signal to produce different tones that carry 
information he explained 
when the modulator malfunctioned what we were receiving was 
the equivalent of a single tone or static when what we wanted to 
hear was beethovens fifth symphony miller said

tens of thousands of japaneseamericans 
interned during world war ii would begin receiving 20000 
reparation checks next year under a bill that may get final 
congressional approval today 
the house voted 249166 thursday to begin dispensing 12 
billion to the 60000 survivors of the camps the senate could 
debate the bill as early as today and it is expected to be passed 
and quickly signed by president bush 
the measure provides 500 million for the payments in the fiscal 
year that began oct 1 the same amount the next year and the 
remaining 200 million beginning october 1992 
rep norman mineta dcalif a japaneseamerican who as a child 
was confined to one of the camps said time was essential because 
200 former internees die each month 
camp survivors who already have died passed away still waiting 
for the stigma on their loyalty to be lifted he said 
the camps set up in 1942 after war broke out with japan were 
sparked by fears that japaneseamericans would subvert the us war 
effort about 120000 japaneseamericans spent most of the war in 
the camps 
conservatives didnt challenge the justification for the 
payments which were authorized in a law last year but they 
objected to language making the disbursements automatic thus 
removing them from competition with other programs for scarce 
federal dollars 
do you elevate these payments above child care asked rep 
harold rogers rky the defense of the country 
the money is part of a housesenate compromise for fiscal 1990 
providing 172 billion for the departments of commerce justice 
and state 
in addition to funding for the reparation the bill leaves 
intact the census bureau practice of counting illegal aliens 
next years count will be used to redraw house district lines 
and lawmakers from states with few illegal immigrants complain that 
including them inflates the number of congressional seats from 
border states the senate had voted to prohibit counting the 
aliens but housesenate bargainers dropped the provision 
the legislation contains new restrictions on the directors of 
the legal services corp the federally subsidized agency that 
provides legal aid to the poor liberals say the corporation board 
is dominated by reaganera appointees and the measure would 
prevent changes in regulations until new directors are appointed 
conservatives lost two efforts 206199 and 223178 to limit 
the corporations participation in suits on behalf of migrant 
workers and erect other constraints 
the bill also includes 
15000 for an oil portrait of former chief justice warren 
burger for the supreme court court officials say portraits of the 
other 14 chief justices already hang in the building the money was 
obtained by sen john warner rva an old friend of burger and 
sen alan cranston dcalif who employs a former burger clerk 
a prohibition on the launch of americanbuilt satellites by 
china or the soviet union the ban against china would be lifted if 
bush certifies that martial law has been lifted and other reforms 
made 
a requirement that the government seek treaties with other 
countries to protect sea turtles 
many pet projects including 55 million for a clinical law 
center at seton hall university in newark nj 45 million for a 
health center at voorhees college in denmark sc and 52 
million for a science research center at the university of kansas

american courts could impose the death penalty 
on terrorists convicted of murdering us citizens under 
legislation that has won overwhelming senate approval 
capital punishment is needed for the kinds of offenses that 
are an affront to humanity sen arlen specter rpa said 
thursday as the senate approved the measure 7920 
under the bill which goes to the house courts would remain 
free to impose prison sentences rather than capital punishment on 
the small number of terrorists who are convicted in us courts of 
overseas murder 
a court would not be able to impose the death penalty unless the 
attorney general certified that the motive for the killing was to 
coerce intimidate or retaliate against a government or civilian 
population 
the bush administration has not taken a position on the narrowly 
drawn onepage bill but it does support a proposal that 
prescribes capital punishment for an array of federal crimes 
the senate plans to vote on that measure later as part of a 
wideranging anticrime package 
the senate rejected 7029 a move to replace the death penalty 
for such terrorist murders with life in prison 
specter said courts should have the option of imposing the death 
penalty on terrorists such as those who planted the bomb aboard the 
pan american jetliner that exploded over scotland in december 
killing 259 people 
opponents said easing the maximum penalty to life in prison 
actually makes the legislation stronger than specters proposal 
which they said would allow courts to impose comparatively short 
sentences or even fines 
you have a possibility in there which is repugnant which is 
that a person convicted of murdering an american citizen in the 
course of a terrorist act will be given a term of years said 
sen carl levin dmich 
if you want to see the people who murdered leon klinghoffer 
get a term of years you vote for the specter bill levin said 
referring to an american tourist in a wheelchair who was shot on a 
cruise ship and thrown into the mediterranean 
sen mark hatfield rore said executing terrorists would 
provide them with the publicity they so ravenously seek and give 
them martyrdom as reward he urged the senate not to succumb to 
a lust for revenge

experts say this years drought isnt as 
bad as last years but thats little consolation for farmers like 
verdun schauer 
ive never seen a failure two years in a row but there are no 
rules against it i guess said schauer 49 who abandoned about 
half the 1500 acres of barley and wheat this year on his farm east 
of bismarck 
although this years drought is less widespread than last 
years its effects are more devastating as it reaches deeper into 
the soil 
we need a lot of moisture to recharge schauer said 
theres no subsoil moisture at all 
this years drought stretches from parts of illinois through the 
dakotas and parts of kansas and nebraska said norton strommen 
chief meteorologist for the us agriculture department 
the soil is so dry in the most severely stricken areas of 
northern iowa southcentral minnesota and the upper plains that it 
would take 4 to 10 inches of rain to bring moisture to normal 
levels he said 
its not as bad this year strommen said this year we got 
very timely rains and yields are up but it was only because of 
the timing and the distribution of the rains combined with the 
temperature patterns that allowed us to get good crops 
nationwide producers are seeing yield increases of up to 30 
percent over last year strommen said farmers also planted more 
acreage than in 1988 
still parts or all of about a dozen states have requested 
disaster asistance the final loss figures have yet to be compiled 
but states like nebraska and north dakota expect to lose about a 
third of their cash crops 
schauer said he lost almost all his crop in 1988 but had enough 
carryover feed to sustain his livestock this year he has no 
carryover and will have to sell cattle 
the second year of a disaster is always worse because you 
dont have the cushion to get you through that you had the first 
year said economist dwight aakre at north dakota state 
university 
in iowa the situation has improved but not in all cases by 
any means said harry hillaker state climatologist 
officials in missouri montana and wisconsin say more farmers 
have healthy crops but fall has been unseasonably dry and some 
rivers are at alltime lows 
there were places i walked where you had to swim before 
said marshall ruegger a forestry official in madison wis he said 
reservoirs on the wisconsin river were at 20 percent of of capacity 
rather than the normal 50 percent at this time of year 
in coleharbor nd recharge ponds that held the citys water 
supply were so depleted the army corps of engineers agreed to pump 
water 3 miles from lake sakakawea on the missouri river 
we had approximately a month left before we ran out of 
water said clayton boots auditor for the town of about 150 
twenty of nebraskas 73 counties find the second year of drought 
even more painful than the first 
nebraska fared well last year because of a large irrigated corn 
crop said lynn lutgen a university of nebraskalincoln

american telephone and telegraph co is going 
to court to fight claims by rival mci communications corp that 
atampt is using false advertising 
atampt filed a countersuit in us district court on thursday in 
response to mcis oct 10 false advertising suit 
mcis ads for longdistance service have misled customers 
about prices about the quality and reach of its service and about 
its facsimile service victor pelson atampt group executive told 
reporters 
mci instead of cleaning up its own advertising act had the 
gall to file a lawsuit pelson said we stand by our 
advertising 
mci chairman william mcgowan said when his company filed its 
suit that atampt was desperately trying to save its eroding 
longdistance business and was losing 100000 customers a week 
pelson said mcgowans claim was absurd 
mci spokeswoman kathleen keegan said thursday that atampt failed 
to challenge that mci allegation in its countersuit 
the most significant thing about atampts countersuit was what 
was not in it she said 
the suits are the latest chapters in mcis long battle with atampt 
that began in the 1970s when mci successfully broke atampts 
longdistance monopoly 
atampt says it has about 70 percent of the longdistance market 
as measured by interstate and intrastate revenues mci is no 2 
with more than 10 percent 
atampts us district court suit denies mcis allegations and 
asks the court to enjoin mci from making false or deceptive 
representations it also asks the court to order mci to make 
corrective ads 
atampt seeks unspecified profits wrongfully amassed by mci on 
the sale of its products or services during the period in 
question plus treble the damages that atampt has sustained because 
of mcis false andor deceptive ads and legal and court costs 
mcis suit alleged that atampt was engaged in maliciously false 
and deceptive advertising it said atampt launched a counterattack in 
january against competitors to regain market share and in july 
began targeting mcis new primetime cutrate longdistance calling 
plan 
merrill tutton atampt vice president for consumer services cited 
an mci ad that says mci always saves you money he said mci was 
making apples and oranges comparisons between its cutrate 
calling plans and atampts standard longdistance rates 
he defended an ad which had particularly incensed mcgowan 
showing a satellite picture of the earth with a quarter segment of 
the planet missing including europe the middle east and north 
africa the ad copy asks is this how your worldwide 
longdistance company sees the world 
mcgowan said the atampt ad implied its competitors didnt serve 
europe 
its not meant to be europe tutton said adding that mci 
doesnt serve 45 countries including the soviet union and cuba 
mcis suit asked that atampt be enjoined from making false or 
deceptive representations that any atampt service is superior or that 
mci has misrepresented its services or rates it also seeks 
corrective notices unspecified profits interest and legal fees

the senates attempt to speed aid to poland 
and hungary is stalled by a republican bid to advance an unrelated 
and controversial issue the capital gains tax cut 
senate majority leader george mitchell made clear thursday that 
he would not permit a republican amendment containing a 
capitalgains measure to come to a vote a decision that threw the 
fate of the polandhungary authorization bill into doubt 
aides said the maine democrat would temporarily shelve the aid 
bill and take up a series of appropriations measures forcing a 
delay likely to postpone consideration of the aid bill for at least 
several days 
the senate on thursday managed to approve a separate resolution 
that will send a team of congressional experts to warsaw to learn 
what the newly elected polish legislature needs in terms of 
training organization computers and other office equipment 
the team then will seek donations from us manufacturers to 
provide basic hardware to help the parliament organize said sen 
pete domenici rnm the measures chief sponsor 
mitchell denounced the gops action in injecting the capital 
gains controversy into the eastern european aid package calling it 
irresponsible in light of polands severe economic problems 
but republican leader bob dole of kansas and other gop members 
said delaying the passage of the aid bill wont affect the flow of 
aid to eastern europe 
all of this wringing of hands is pure politics dole said 
its the old democratic game of crying wolf 
domenici said no one in poland should be concerned by the 
delay because the aid program will be funded only by actual 
appropriations not authorizations that set maximum levels of aid 
and spell out policy guidelines 
in fact domenici said 100 million in food aid for poland has 
already been appropriated and is en route to poland 
the principal ingredients are either already funded or will 
be funded domenici said 
the authorization bill features competing democratic and 
republican spending levels democrats seek 989 million over three 
years republicans want a leaner 585 million package 
bushs insistence on a capitalgains cut and the democratic 
leaderships opposition to it have overshadowed consideration of 
budget issues since june 
the fight has delayed action on a deficitreduction bill until 
nov 1 at the earliest a full month after the opening of the 1990 
budget year it threatens to delay a bill to raise the governments 
borrowing authority past oct 31 
the house voted a capitalgains tax cut as part of its 
deficitreduction plan the cut being pushed by senate republicans 
is considerably different from the house plan and includes an 
expansion of individual retirement accounts 
if action on the polandhungary aid bill is delayed past this 
week as appears likely republican senators likely will try to add 
their capitalgains reduction to legislation boosting government 
borrowing authority democrats would try to talk the gop effort to 
death and the borrowing bill would be caught in the crossfire 
unless the borrowing authority is raised next week the 
government might be forced into several drastic actions including 
delaying social security checks

officials say the man charged with slugging 
sen john glenn was trying to reach pope john paul ii in an effort 
to prevent a nuclear war 
michael breen appeared in us district court on thursday and 
was ordered held without bond and sent to a federal prison hospital 
for psychiatric evaluation 
the 31yearold washington engineer told district of columbia 
detective tom johnson that he wanted the pope to reveal the 
contents of a message some roman catholics believe was received 
from the virgin mary 
the defendant stated that he wanted the notoriety of the event 
to get the pope to read the fatima message to prevent a nuclear 
war johnson said in a sworn statement supporting the criminal 
complaint 
in 1917 three children in fatima portugal said they were 
visited by the virgin mary the mother of jesus 
they said she made six appearances telling them to pray and do 
penance part of the story of fatima also holds that there was a 
secret message never publicly revealed by the vatican said r 
bruce miller head of the religious studies library at catholic 
university in washington 
miller said some theologians doubt the existence of a secret 
message 
breen told the detective hed been having dreams for about 10 
months in which god gave him information about possible future 
disasters and that he feared last weeks california earthquake 
could have triggered a nuclear war 
defense lawyer barry stiller refused to discuss his clients 
religious beliefs saying hed only spent 30 minutes with breen 
before the court appearance 
hes just a very nice young man who i think is a little 
confused stiller said after the proceeding 
breen an engineer with martin marietta corp appeared calm 
during the proceedings he looked frequently at family members and 
once made the sign of the cross as lawyers conferred with the 
magistrate deborah robinson about the location of his 30day 
psychiatric evaluation 
robinson sent breen to a federal prison hospital in north 
carolina despite defense objections that it was too far away from 
legal counsel and family 
the charge against breen is a felony that carries a maximum 
penalty of 10 years in prison and a 10000 fine 
glenn dohio was struck in the jaw wednesday while giving an 
interview the incident was recorded by a television camera 
a day earlier breen was detained by us capitol police and the 
secret service after breaking through a police line and trying to 
reach out to vice president dan quayles motorcade 
breen told police god guided him to the outdoor treeplanting 
ceremony where the 68yearold glenn was a participant and he 
struck sen glenn in order to get mass media attention according 
to the statement distributed by the us attorneys office

republicans and conservative democrats who 
sustained president bushs veto of an increase in the minimum wage 
are pushing the white house to compromise on a scaledback version 
of the bill 
administration officials however are sending mixed signals 
floating possible concessions one day but insisting the next that 
bush wont budge from last springs best first and only offer 
compromise or not house majority leader richard gephardt 
dmo said thursday that a bill raising the wage floor to 425 
from the 335 level where its been since 1981 will be voted on 
wednesday 
bush vetoed a bill in june that would have increased the minimum 
wage to 455 an hour and established a subminimum training wage of 
335 for the first 60 days of a firsttime workers employment 
he vowed to do the same again on any subsequent attempt that 
goes higher than 425 an hour hits that level before 1992 or 
provides for less than a sixmonth subminimum scale for any new 
hires regardless of previous job experience 
white house chief of staff john sununu told house speaker thomas 
s foley dwash and gop leader robert h michel of illinois on 
thursday that bush wouldnt budge 
we didnt reach agreement on anything foley told reporters 
after the white house meeting 
michel held out hope there may be room for some bending 
the president will have to bend a little bit to avoid a veto 
fight he said i dont think the president would enjoy vetoing a 
second minimum wage bill 
senate republicans led by minority leader bob dole of kansas 
and sen pete v domenici of new mexico also have been urging the 
white house to compromise 
however lawmakers and lobbyists on both sides said the white 
house didnt begin focusing on the issue until late last week and 
is scrambling for a way to prevent its allies from jumping to the 
other side 
they want to come in at the last minute and make a deal but 
theres no firm decision on what they want said rep timothy j 
penny of minnesota one of 28 democrats who voted last summer to 
sustain bushs veto 
sununu according to congressional sources and lobbyists 
earlier this week floated as a possible compromise gradually 
increasing the wage floor to 425 an hour by july 1991 six 
months earlier than bush wanted with a threemonth subminimum for 
new hires but it was not put forth thursday 
theyre floundering all over the place said robert 
mcglotten the aflcios chief lobbyist they keep talking like 
they want to make some movement but when we sit down with them we 
get nowhere 
a strategist for a business group opposed to any increase 
agreed speaking on the condition of anonymity he said 
administration officials this week presented one possible training 
wage compromise that was so convoluted and complicated that it 
could never be used 
mcglotten said theres no give by unions on the issue of 
achieving a 90cent increase to 425 an hour by january 1991 but 
he expressed a willingness to negotiate the training wage issue as 
long as employers are prevented from using it as a perpetual source 
of below minimumscale labor 
whatever the outcome liberal democrats and supporters of bushs 
earlier veto agree that minimum wage supporters have the upper hand 
democrats want to have a bill approved by both the house and 
senate and on bushs desk before the nov 13 arrival in washington 
of polish solidarity leader lech walesa believing his visit will 
make a veto more difficult 
there is a lot of nervousness on the part of the white house 
that they could look like a mean old ogre fighting day and night 
to get a capital gains tax break while also fighting equally hard 
against raising the minimum wage penny said 
rep david bonior dmich said supporters still lack a 
twothirds vetoproof majority for the new bill which would raise 
the wage floor to 380 in january and to 425 by january 1991 
with a 60day training wage only for firsttime workers 
but were gaining ground bonior said

michael flatley knew he had fast feet but didnt 
think about seeking official recognition for his tapdancing 
prowess until sen ted kennedy suggested he try for a spot in the 
guinness book of world records 
then it became a quest for the 31year old hoofer who made it 
into the new edition of the record book with a 28tappersecond 
performance 
i really believed i was the best in the world and im saying 
this as modestly as i can it seemed to me to be a good way to 
prove i was the best he said in a recent interview 
tap dancing for me is a very powerful masculine thing he 
said thats how i approach it 
his feet are enshrined in the guinness edition that arrived in 
bookstores this week heelandtoeing it for a tape recorder and 
guinness judges in a suburban dance studio in may he beat the 
previous record of 24 taps per second set by roy castle on jan 
14 1973 on a bbctv program 
flatley a native of southwest chicago developed his 
nimblelegged style through years of irish step dancing and won 
the world step dancing championship in dublin in 1975 
people had suggested he try for a tap record before but it was 
at a performance for the massachusetts democrat last year that 
flatleys mind was made up 
ted kennedy said your feet should be in the guinness book of 
world records flatley recalled i became obsessed with it i 
had no idea it was going to be that difficult 
since flatleys training comes from step dancing done with 
arms rigidly held at the side of the body he has his detractors 
among purists of dance 
well he made 28 sounds with his feet said lane alexander 
a noted tap teacher and performer in chicago that doesnt make 
him a tap dancer

legislation is heading to president bush that 
will increase disaster payments to farmers who planted replacement 
crops after their wheat and cotton failed because of bad weather 
this year 
the senate and house gave final approval to the measure 
thursday and republican leader bob dole rkan predicted bush 
would sign the bill pushed through by farmstate lawmakers in a 
bipartisan effort 
farmers had a legitimate gripe that producers who moved 
quickly to plant a second crop on failed acres shouldnt be 
penalized when it came time to qualify for federal disaster aid 
dole said 
the measure will change the way disaster assistance payments are 
calculated for farmers who planted a replacement crop after 
drought flooding and other extreme weather destroyed their first 
crops 
lawmakers have complained that an agriculture department formula 
will penalize those producers and in some instances mean farmers 
could receive no disaster payments even though they earned little 
or no profit on their second crops 
winter wheat and cotton farmers will be particularly affected 
because many planted grain sorghum and soybeans after their initial 
crops failed 
the problem stems from a nearly 900 million disaster relief 
package enacted in august in an effort to prevent farmers from 
reaping double benefits the law required usda to reduce assistance 
payments to farmers by the value of any crop that replaced one 
ruined by bad weather 
congress didnt spell out how to determine the replacement crop 
value leaving that to usda the agency decided to deduct 75 
percent of the gross value of the replacement crop from the 
disaster payment a farmer would have otherwise received for losses 
on his first crop 
lawmakers reacted angrily contending that usdas formula was 
arbitrary and failed to account for regiontoregion differences in 
production costs 
under the legislation that system would be modified 
farmers would have no payment reductions if their replacement 
crops failed to produce more than 50 percent of the county average 
yield those farmers harvesting more than that amount would have 
usdas deduction applied only on the value of their replacement 
crop above the 50 percent yield threshold 
in addition replacement crop deductions would be applied only 
against disaster assistance earned on acres actually replanted 
farmers would receive smaller payments without those acreage 
offsets

in june 1942 hayao shishino waited for his 
diploma with hundreds of other japaneseamerican high school 
seniors attending graduation ceremonies at an internment camp 
his wait lasted 47 years 
shishinos name and those of 14 fellow japaneseamerican 
seniors from los angeles high school were never called 
because they were among 120000 japaneseamericans forced into 
camps after war broke out with japan the students couldnt afford 
caps and gowns or graduation parties but they were looking forward 
to getting the diplomas 
we waited until the last to hear our names shishino 
recalled this week we waited to hear our school but we waited 
for nothing 
on saturday a special ceremony will be held at los angeles high 
in an attempt to redress at least in part what todays los 
angeles unified school board members believe was a historical wrong 
shishino and 10 of the 15 other former students will finally get 
their sheepskins they will be dated june 26 1942 but will be 
signed by members of the current school board 
one of the 15 has since died and three others cannot attend the 
ceremony shishino said 
other japaneseamerican students imprisoned in the camp at santa 
anita racetrack before the end of their senior year in 1942 got 
their diplomas at that original ceremony shishino blames wartime 
antijapanese hysteria and the attitudes of the late paul webb 
principal of los angeles high for his being left out 
webb who died in 1982 refused to issue the students diplomas 
even though the school board ordered that all graduating 
japaneseamerican seniors in good standing be given diplomas 
shishino said 
he told me flat to my face that i didnt deserve one 
recalled shishino now 64 and a retired cook living in the los 
angeles suburb of cerritos he was just prejudiced against 
japaneseamericans 
the new ceremony grew out of a letter shishino wrote earlier 
this year to warren furutani a los angeles unified school board 
member and a japaneseamerican whose motherinlaw was among the 
students who were denied diplomas 
furutani had district employees search old records to document 
shishinos claims shishino and the other former students received 
letters last week announcin gthe ceremony 
it was time to set the record straight said furutani 
more important than the diplomas will be the chance to educate 
americans about the injustices suffered by japaneseamericans 
during world war ii said furutanis motherinlaw aiko yoshinaga 
some people just dont believe there were such things as 
concentration camps in this country said mrs yoshinaga who 
planned to fly out from her virginia home for the ceremony 
many young people still dont know the japaneseamericans were 
treated as enemy aliens said shishino who was born in los 
angeles 
although upset about being left out of the communal graduation 
ceremony getting my diploma was the least of my worries in those 
days he said 
just surviving and thinking about the future were more 
important you see we had lost everything our apartment our 
furniture our cars my fathers flower business said shishino 
my parents were just given two weeks to take the most important 
things we owned and pack it into one suitcase 
the us house voted thursday to begin making 12 billion in 
reparation payments next year to the 60000 surviving 
japaneseamericans confined to camps during world war ii the bill 
now moves to the senate 
but shishino says its more than a matter of money 
money alone can never repay the injustice weve suffered he 
said we were americans and we were treated like we were spies

women will be able to reduce their risk of 
toxic shock syndrome when tampon makers begin complying with a new 
government regulation requiring standardized absorbency labeling 
health officials say 
within four months all tampon makers will have to use uniform 
terms with specified absorbency ranges allowing women to compare 
brands and choose lowerabsorbency products the food and drug 
administration said 
the fdas announcement of the final regulation thursday capped 
nearly a decade of haggling with industry and consumer groups and 
complied with a court order that set an oct 30 deadline for 
issuing a rule 
the labeling will require manufacturers to use the terms 
junior regular super and super plus to describe 
the absorbency of their products 
each term denotes a specified range of absorbency and 
manufacturers will be required to include an explanation of the 
ranges and how women can use the information they also will be 
required to advise on labels that women can reduce risk of toxic 
shock by alternating sanitary napkins with tampons 
the risk of toxic shock syndrome a rare but sometimes fatal 
condition increases with higher tampon absorbency 
women who choose to use tampons instead of sanitary napkins 
which have no known risk of toxic shock should use the lowest 
absorbency product that is effective for them said fda 
commissioner frank young 
public health officials became aware of toxic shock syndrome in 
the early part of the decade 
in 1982 the agency required that tampon labeling include a 
warning about the association between tampon use and toxic shock 
and advised women to use the lowest absorbency to control menstrual 
flow 
the labeling also had to list the symptoms of toxic shock 
sudden fever of 102 or more vomiting diarrhea fainting or 
nearfainting when standing up dizziness and a sunburnlike rash 
the fda tried unsuccessfully for several years to get tampon 
makers to agree on a uniform labeling system in september 1988 
the agency proposed a labeling regulation that would use a series 
of letters to designate absorbency 
the fda revised the proposal in june to require use of new terms 
to indicate absorbency though manufacturers could still use their 
old terms as well consumers and manufacturers argued for 
standardizing the terms 
the public citizen health research group went to court to force 
the fda to issue a final regulation and the district court for the 
district of columbia gave the agency until oct 30

house republican whip newt gingrich is calling 
new ethics charges filed against him by an arkansas democrat 
baseless and politically motivated 
gingrich said thursday that the latest ethics complaint by rep 
bill alexander is the product of a deeply troubled and desperate 
man trying to generate publicity 
alexander filed his new complaint along with 670 pages of 
supporting documents late wednesday a week after the outside 
counsel hired by the house ethics committee to evaluate his first 
complaint against gingrich concluded there was no reason for the 
panel to investigate the georgia republican 
the committee will meet tuesday 
gingrich rose to prominence in the house after filing the ethics 
complaint that led to the resignation in june of jim wright a 
texas democrat who was speaker of the house 
gingrich denied several of the allegations including 
alexanders contention that he funneled 12000 in advertising and 
20000 in contributions to the 1986 reelection campaign of 
thensen mack mattingly rga and didnt report either as 
required by federal election law 
alexanders initial complaint alleged that gingrich violated 
house rules and federal campaign finance laws by getting 21 
supporters to invest 5000 each in a limited partnership to 
promote his 1984 book window of opportunity

a study says community colleges are failing to 
motivate poor and minority students to go beyond their twoyear 
programs 
the transfer function of community colleges is in crisis 
said the academy for educational development report funded by the 
ford foundation and published by the college board 
researchers fred pincus and elayne archer said twoyear colleges 
are a critical part of the educational system and have an important 
role to play because they have taken on the awesome task of 
working to salvage hope for so many who have been given up on by 
others 
but they said it is equally important that community colleges 
work to provide paths of upward mobility by helping students 
transfer to fouryear colleges 
the report bridges to opportunity said a small percentage 
of community college students transfer to fouryear schools and 
fewer yet actually get bachelors degrees it said the transfer 
rates are smaller for black hispanic and indian students than for 
white and asianamerican students 
pincus said studies show that onethird to onehalf of students 
say they enrolled in a community college to prepare for transfer to 
a fouryear school 
but he said the current transfer rate is 15 percent to 25 
percent of all community college students and 20 percent to 30 
percent of those students who say they want to transfer only 10 
percent to 15 percent of all community college students receive a 
bachelors degree he said

the labor department reports that 
privatesector workers who got new contracts through collective 
bargaining from january through september won average annual wage 
increases of 31 percent 
that compared with average gains of 24 percent in their prior 
contracts the department said thursday 
the data covers contracts for 13 million workers negotiated in 
the first nine months of the year 
if the trend continues for the final three months 1989 would be 
the first year since 1981 in which new contracts provide workers 
with better pay raises on average than their prior contracts the 
department said 
the rebound in wage gains was attributed to the restoration of 
prior concessions in several industries that were slumping earlier 
in the decade particularly the us steel industry 
also the labor department said wage increases given workers in 
the health care sector particularly nurses were outpacing the 
gains provided in prior contracts competition for skilled workers 
in that sector has pushed wages higher

head injuries caused 2 percent of all deaths in 
the united states in a recent sevenyear period and the most 
common causes were auto crashes guns and falls according to 
doctors who studied such deaths 
the death rate for americans with head injuries was 169 per 
100000 people from 1979 through 1986 said dr daniel m sosin and 
his colleagues at the division of injury epidemiology and control 
of the centers for disease control in atlanta 
they reported in todays edition of the journal of the american 
medical association that they identified 315328 deaths associated 
with head injuries 
of those injuries 57 percent were suffered in motor vehicle 
accidents most commonly among people younger than 35 the 
physicians said 
whites ages 15 to 24 had a death rate of 227 per 100000 from 
head injuries suffered in motor vehicle accidents the researchers 
said blacks of the same age group had a death rate of 92 per 
100000 from vehicle accidents 
another 14 percent of the fatal head injuries were caused by 
guns 
among blacks ages 25 to 34 homicides by firearm caused 42 
deaths per 100000 more than five times the rate for whites in 
the same age group 
the death rate for head injuries from suicidal gunshot wounds 
however was much higher for whites of all ages 164 per 100000 
than it was for blacks with a rate of 065 per 100000 
falls were the third most common cause of fatal head injuries 
accounting for 12 percent of the total the physicians found they 
also found that the death rate for falls rose with the age of the 
populace 
the sharpest rise came after age 75 sosin said with 206 
deaths per 100000 for males in the oldest age group and 113 per

more than 1000 state prison inmates 
rioted for a second night thursday taking eight hostages and 
igniting numerous fires and explosions that shrouded the prison in 
thick black smoke authorities said 
state police and firefighters struggled to regain control of the 
camp hill mediumsecurity prison early friday with three cell 
blocks and four other housing units ablaze at least 84 people have 
been injured in two days of rioting but no fatalities were 
reported 
flames from a huge fire just inside the main gate shot 50 to 100 
feet into the air and several explosions were heard the incident 
which began during a lockdown started shortly after 7 pm 
thursday 
its total chaos they lost control said a guard who was in 
one of the cell blocks when thursdays disturbance began the 
officers were told to lock the doors and leave we had to get out 
they said they were going to kill us 
last night was a riot tonight was war said the guard a 
sixyear staff member he refused to give his name 
another guard said an explosion was ignited in the prisons 
furniture factory the force rattled windows up to about a mile 
away inmates threw rocks at firefighters as they battled the main 
gate fire 
at about 130 am there was a large explosion in an area about 
300 yards from the inferno one building inside the complex 
collapsed said sgt alan taylor of the mechanicsburg police 
basically the prison is a total loss all the buildings are 
destroyed said cpl david steffen of the northern york county 
regional police who were called in to assist 
john palakovich assistant to the prison superintendent said 
one hostage a guard had been released shortly after midnight he 
gave no details 
inmates holding the hostages were demanding to talk to gov 
robert p casey and the human rights group amnesty international 
said state police cpl raul ramos who said negotiations were 
taking place by phone casey said earlier in the day he would not 
talk with the inmates 
state police who had about 500 troopers at the scene began to 
retake the prison after midnight palakovich said 
it is under way he said four cellblocks had been regained 
and 700 of the prisons 2600 inmates were under control he said 
earlier palakovich said there are more inmates involved at 
this point than there were last night when 1200 prisoners went 
on a rampage a total of nine fires were set thursday causing more 
extensive damage than the previous nights riot he said 
at least 37 eople were injured in the second night of rioting 
most of them firefighters palakovich said local hospitals 
reported treating 20 people others were treated at the scene about 
4 miles west of harrisburg the state capital 
palakovich said he couldnt say whether the seven remaining 
hostages were guards or support staff and he believed they were 
being held in two separate cell blocks he said there was some 
contact between inmates and prison negotiators 
inmates had gotten into prison tools such as screwdrivers 
hammers and saws palakovich said he had no reports that prisoners 
had any weapons 
inmates milled around the prison yard as flames leaped from at 
least two buildings and a police helicopter hovered overhead other 
police fired warning shots in the air a firetruck was inside the 
prison fence pouring water on one of the fires 
just before midnight five officers on horseback were sent into 
the prison 
earlier prison authorities said inmates had been locked in 
their cells and a state of emergency was in effect following 
wednesdays rampage during which four buildings were torched 
palakovich said the latest incident started during a feeding 
period but he could not explain how prisoners got out of their 
locked cells while being served meals he said some inmates got 
keys and let other inmates out of their cells 
there was a bunch of little fires at first but they started 
putting mattresses on the windows said steve tobias of nearby 
lemoyne who was passing the prison as the new outbreak began 
he said a whole bunch of inmates were running toward the 
fence but when they heard the shots they went back the other 
way 
palakovich said fires were burning in three of 10 cell blocks 
and four modular housing units trailerlike buildings used to 
ease overcrowding and the education building earlier in the day 
prison superintendent robert freeman said wednesdays sevenhour 
riot may have been caused by overcrowding and inmates anger over 
policy changes 
during that uprising eight guards were held hostage for up to 
four hours and some guards were beaten four guards and one inmate 
were still hospitalized thursday 
before thursday nights eruption freeman met for an hour with 
six of the inmates who had helped negotiate an end to the siege the 
day before he said inmates were upset by changes in the prisons 
medical care policy and over a decision not to allow families to 
bring in food during extended familyday visits 
overcrowded conditions and a shortage of guards may also have 
contributed to the disturbance he said camp hill with 2600 
inmates is about 45 percent over capacity and the entire state 
prison system is about 48 percent over capacity 
attorney general ernie preate jr said the disturbance at camp 
hill and a smaller uprising at huntingdon state prison on monday 
were the predictable result of a prison crowding crisis that has 
been allowed to fester for too long 
freeman said he did not make any promises during the meeting he 
also said no decision has been made on whether to file charges 
the new medical policy actually improves access to care but 
inmates viewed the change as an attempt to restrict health care 
freeman said adding that the staff could have done a better job 
explaining the changes the change involved assigning routine 
examinations to certain days 
freeman said that food could no longer be brought in because it 
could be used to bring in drugs cash and other contraband 
thirtyfive prison guards or staff nine inmates two state 
police troopers and a firefighter were injured in wednesdays riot 
said ken robinson a spokesman for the state department of 
corrections 
one of the guards glenn l koons 63 of hershey was in 
serious condition in intensive care at community general 
osteopathic hospital in harrisburg with multiple fractures the 
condition of the others ranged from fair to good hospital 
officials said 
freeman said six of the 10 cellblocks were damaged extensively 
and the commissary was destroyed in wednesdays riot 
this weeks uprisings were the latest in a series of problems 
within pennsylvanias prison system a federal judge in august 
ordered the state to close part of the western penitentiary in 
pittsburgh because of unsafe and unconstitutional conditions 
the state is challenging that ruling and the prison remains open

because thoughts and convictions alone are no 
longer considered crimes by the soviet government the kgb has 
abolished a unit known for persecuting dissidents a government 
newspaper said 
the izvestia newspaper quoted kgb chairman vladimir a kryuchkov 
thursday as saying the definition of antisoviet crimes had become 
narrower the laws had changed and people no longer have to fear a 
simple slip of the tongue 
in and of themselves thoughts and convictions no matter what 
they are are not considered crimes if they are not realized in 
actions included in the law kryuchkov was quoted as saying 
he said the infamous 5th directorate had been abolished and a 
new unit would work to foil the conspiracies of foreign 
intelligence services to create and use organized antigovernment 
groups in our country it also he said would try to prevent 
mass disorders and other illegal phenomena of an extremist bent 
kryuchkov told izvestia the new subdivision for the defense of 
the soviet constitutional structure would continue to fight 
antisocialist elements in the country 
kryuchkov who has tried to promote the image of a new and 
kinder security service said the 5th directorate was founded in 
1967 to counter ideological sabotage 
he acknowledged mistakes shortcomings and unfortunately 
abuses but said poor laws were partly responsible 
yuri mityunov a veteran dissident said thursday that 5th 
directorate personnel functioned as ideological police 
in its time it punished people for telling political jokes 
he said in a telephone interview theyre the people who are 
listening to us now 
mityunov said he believed the kgb was redistributing some 
functions but still was intent on harassing dissidents and even 
assassinating people it viewed as political threats 
western sources say the 5th directorate locked dissidents away 
in prisons and mental hospitals controlled religion in a 
clandestine manner and persecuted jews seeking to emigrate and 
other minorities for nationalist activities

prisoners are kept chained to the walls of 
local police lockups for as long as three days at a time because of 
overcrowding in regular jail cells police said 
overcrowding at the baltimore county detention center has forced 
police to house hundreds of prisoners in nine precinct stations 
which lack the facilities or staff to keep prisoners under constant 
observation while in their cells authorities said 
the prisoners are chained to horseshoeshaped bars fastened to a 
wall near the booking area of each precinct where desk supervisors 
can watch them said stephen r doarnberger a police spokesman 
their legs are shackled at the ankles and one arm is attached to 
the bar with leg irons to give them enough mobility to sit or 
stand he said 
at night the prisoners are given a small mattress and a 
blanket doarnberger said they eat in the hallway but are 
released to use the restroom 
the other prisoners are kept together in a single cell with one 
toilet most sleep on the floor with mattresses provided each 
night 
mark a levine the county undersheriff said the county 
detention center which can properly handle 410 prisoners 
currently houses 697 inmates 
an annex that will add 228 beds is not expected to be ready for 
another three years 
that leaves us between a rock and a hard place said col 
michael d gambrill who is in charge of the lockups we are not 
really supposed to be in the prison business but we are 
gambrill said one reason for the added vigilance was to guard 
against suicide attempts earlier this year a federal jury awarded 
185000 to the family of a man who killed himself at a precinct 
station in 1987 
thirteen prisoners attempted suicide in the lockups this year 
police said and 33 tried to kill themselves last year all 
unsuccessfully in 1987 there were 13 attempted suicides in the 
lockups and two suicides

a fire visible from two miles away 
raged early today in a plastics plant outside dallas but 
authorities said it posed no danger to residents and hadnt caused 
any injuries 
meanwhile the search for victims of a huge explosion at a 
plastics plant in pasadena continued today seven are confirmed 
dead and 15 missing from the series of blasts that destroyed the 
phillips petroleum co plant near houston on monday 
the blaze today at the polyamerica corp factory which makes 
plastic bags and other plastic items broke out at 11 pm 
thursday said james smith assistant fire chief in this dallas 
suburb 
the plant was closed for the night and no one was believed 
inside smith said 
the fire was burning out of control early today but didnt 
threaten to spread beyond the plant smith said adding that 
firefighters expected it to burn through the night though they were 
pouring water on the flames 
there wasnt much we could do on this one smith said 
the cause had yet to be determined smith said 
flames were seen from two miles away and thick smoke from 
burning plastic billowed from the fire but smith said evacuations 
were unnecessary in the largely industrial area because the smoke 
wasnt highly toxic the nearest homes were a mile away and the 
smoke was blowing toward a 700acre vacant field 
at the phillips plant the search for victims and for clues to 
the cause of the blast was halted for about five hours thursday 
because of a hydrocarbon leak but sampling showed the leak didnt 
pose a danger said phillips spokesman george minter 
were taking an extremely conservative safety measure he 
said as activity was suspended 
the investigation and cleanup work are being conducted around 
the clock at the ruined plant which produced plastic pellets used 
to make milk jugs and grocery bags 
two victims bodies were found thursday outside a reactor 
control room said phillips spokesman scott carlberg 
company experts have said the explosions began in ethylene and 
isobutane gases leaking from a chemical reactor but they have yet 
to determine what ignited the gas 
phillips has yet to decide on the plants future said lavele 
franz vice president of human resources and services

publishing its sevenmonthold sunday edition after nov 26 because 
it hasnt attracted enough advertisers or readers 
the sunday post first hit the stands march 5 amid a blitz of

for the common sunday 
the first issues included supplements devoted to books travel 
and television and long feature stories in the news section owner 
peter kalikow said the first four weeks of ads for the sunday post 
were sold out 
but advertising quickly declined and the sunday post lost 
millions of dollars within a few months

price was slashed from 1 to 40 cents 
in announcing the decision to cease publication of the sunday 
post kalikow said thursday the sunday paper attracted 250000 
readers 
this is still nowhere near the over 500000 readers who 
purchase the paper on a daily basis kalikow said in a news 
release the circulation and advertising revenue mix on sunday 
simply does not lend itself to continued publication of this 
edition the economics just arent there

resources on ensuring the longterm profitability and viability of

incumbent kathy whitmire is banking on her 
leadership during the lean years of the oil bust to carry her to a 
recordtying fifth consecutive term as mayor of houston 
polls give her a large lead over former twoterm mayor fred 
hofheinz her main opponent among six challengers in the nov 7 
election 
mrs whitmire a 43yearold accountant won her first twoyear 
term in 1978 a recent houston chronicle poll showed mrs whitmire 
with a lead of nearly 20 percent over hofheinz 
it seems like this is going to be a very difficult race for 
mr hofheinz to turn around very difficult said bob stein a 
rice university political scientist at this point i cant 
identify an issue that he can do that with 
the issue he has chosen to campaign on drugs he is losing 
he is not seen as more capable to fight the war on drugs 
hofheinz contends that the current administration has run out 
of gas he added that if eight years are enough for a president 
it should be more than enough for mrs whitmire 
in her 1985 campaign mrs whitmire easily whipped former mayor 
louie welch whose 19641973 tenure set a longevity record she is 
trying to match the citys longestserving chief executive oscar 
holcombe held office for 22 years but not consecutively between 
1921 and 1958 
mrs whitmire said she looks forward to leading the nations 
fourthlargest city into the 1990s 
she has pledged to make the fight on illegal drugs her highest 
priority we need to make this city the least attractive to crack 
dealers she said 
hofheinz argues that the drug war cannot be won without the 
houston police departments support two major police unions 
bitterly at odds with mrs whitmire have endorsed hofheinz 
although they opposed him when he was in office from 1974 to 1977 
hofheinz 51 an attorney with a doctorate in economics 
attributes low police morale to mrs whitmires administration 
until the first police cadet class of 70 began this month some 500 
officers had left the department in the past three years and none 
were replaced 
with city revenues down because of the oil bust police and 
other city workers took a 3 percent pay cut in 1986 only recently 
was the cut restored 
mrs whitmire took office at the height of the oil boom when 
the bubble burst unemployment reached almost 13 percent prominent 
businesses filed for bankruptcy skyscrapers sat empty and the 
housing market came to a standstill 
mrs whitmire said she has steered the city through the tough 
times and boasts that unemployment has been lowered to about 5 
percent 
now that houston is enjoying economic recovery it is no 
surprise that others relish the thought of serving as mayor mrs 
whitmire said 
another change houstonians have seen during the mayors tenure 
is with the mayor herself 
gone are the dowdy days of dark suits with bow ties largeframe 
glasses and shoulderlength locks that had local wits comparing her 
to the female impersonator dustin hoffman portrayed in tootsie 
the mayor has switched to brighter fashionable dresses and 
suits contact lenses and a modified bob haircut

east germanys new leadership today declared an 
amnesty for all citizens accused of illegally trying to escape from 
the communist nation a move expected to free several thousand 
people from prison 
the amnesty also would allow tens of thousands of east germans 
who have fled to west germany through hungary czechoslovakia and 
poland in recent months to return home without facing criminal 
prosecution 
the announcement came a day after more than 100000 people 
rallied in dresden and other east german cities for democratic 
reform and a politburo member began talks with a leading 
opposition group 
the amnesty which also covers those who took part in illegal 
street protests is the firmest step toward reform since egon krenz 
replaced longtime leader erich honecker as communist party chief 
on oct 18 
it was announced by the official news agency adn which said all 
prisoners affected would be freed by nov 30 although east germany 
does not release information on inmate numbers western sources 
said the measure would affect thousands 
adn said the amnesty covered all people accused of border 
violations through today 
also today the nations legendary former intelligence chief 
markus wolf called for greater openness and expressed some 
sympathy for the refugees who headed west 
in an interview with party newspaper neues deutschland wolf 
said the recovery of trust is demanded before we can develop 
further indicating krenz may be open to loosening some 
constraints on the media and free expression 
late thursday the staterun adn news agency reported the huge 
rally in dresden and said 15000 people also marched in erfurt 
25000 in rostock and 5000 more in gera 
earlier east berlin communist party chief guenter schabowski 
talked for two hours with scientists jens reich and sebastian 
pflugbeil founding members of the group new forum it was the 
first time a member of the ruling polituro met with the group the 
largest of the new organizations pushing for reform 
communist authorities banned new forum in september but have 
tolerated the group anyway 
reich described the talks as open and constructive we 
presented new forums concepts and ideas 
he said schabowski told us he wanted to begin a new political 
course and wanted to learn about the whole political spectrum 
here 
reich a molecular biologist at east berlins academy of 
sciences said schabowski assured him the governments interest in 
talks to solve the nations problems was a real change and not a 
tactical move 
reich and other new forum leaders later addressed several 
hundred people in an east berlin church to explain the groups aims 
and their talks with schabowski 
east german television broadcast a special program on the church 
meeting the television and adn reports both marked a radical 
change from previous practice when statecontrolled media limited 
themselves to reporting only official party policy 
in staging rallies thursday demonstrators ignored an earlier 
appeal by communist authorities for citizens not to protest in the 
streets 
in dresden however the demonstration appeared to have the 
official blessing of local communist authorities 
at the openair rally in the southern industrial city 
opposition leaders and local communist party officials addressed 
the crowd from a podium equipped with loudspeakers adn said 
hans modrow the local party chief long believed to be a strong 
supporter of reform told the crowd a process had begun that would 
lead to revolutionary change adn said 
east berlins mayor erhard krack on thursday invited 
citizens interested in dialogue to a discussion at city hall 
and at the capital citys convention center on sunday adn said 
east germanys federation of lawyers called on the government to 
allow multicandidate elections and demanded reform of the nations 
legal system

john major who went from welfare recipient to 
economic overlord is a trapeze artists son whose own climb to 
lofty heights has been nothing short of meteoric 
the former foreign secretary was chosen by prime minister 
margaret thatcher on thursday to become chancellor of the 
exchequer replacing nigel lawson in the top treasury post 
rising from humble origins the 46yearold major is regarded as 
a prime example of the ambitious and successful tories who have 
thrived during the thatcher decade 
major is widely regarded as an orthodox monetarist and a 
thatcher loyalist political analysts said his appointment likely 
wont mark significant changes in british economic policy 
major quickly issued a statement in which he vowed to continue 
the governments fight against inflation and maintain a tight 
monetary stance 
the appointment came just three months after major was pushed 
into the limelight and made foreign secretary he had been chief 
secretary to the treasury 
his appointment as foreign secretary in july replacing sir 
geoffrey howe was part of one of mrs thatchers boldest political 
strokes howe now serves as deputy prime minister 
but as one of mrs thatchers current favorites major has been 
satirized by opposition labor party members as her poodle 
when major was a child his father a circus stuntman who 
performed on both tightrope and trapeze was declared bankrupt 
major was brought up in a couple of rooms in brixton a tough 
south london neighborhood 
in his teens he was a soapbox tory and after high school he 
joined an accounting firm as a trainee 
he left to become a construction laborer because he said 
there was more money in it 
major is the only cabinet member to have been on the dole 
or welfare for eight months 
he did volunteer work in nigeria during the civil war there and 
survived a car crash over a cliff with only a smashed leg 
in the hospital he decided to go into politics 
i came to the conclusion that i wanted to be inside the 
goldfish bowl rather than outside longingly looking in major 
has said 
before making his bid for the house of commons however he 
established a career at the standard chartered bank 
he won a seat in parliament in 1979 and his rise since has been 
one of the fastest in recent political history 
his manner is gentle and conscientious and he has a reputation 
for quickly grasping figures and detail 
majors wife norma has written a biography of opera singer joan 
sutherland the majors have a son and a daughter 
the family lives in huntingdon 59 miles north of london but 
likely will move to 11 downing st next door to the prime 
ministers residence where the chancellor traditionally resides

chinese military officers ordered off a joint 
arms project with the united states after the beijing crackdown on 
prodemocracy protesters were allowed back to work this month a 
newspaper reported today 
the 42 officers are assigned to project peace pearl a 500 
million program to upgrade chinese f8 fighter planes with china 
expected to ultimately buy enhanced aviation electronic technology 
they were taken off the project at grumman corp in bethpage 
ny and wrightpatterson air force base near dayton ohio when 
president bush banned highlevel contacts with china after the 
chinese army attacked demonstrators in june killing hundreds and 
perhaps thousands in beijing 
but early this month the bush administration quietly lifted the 
suspension the los angeles times reported in todays editions 
seven of the chinese officers who stayed in the united states 
returned to work oct 2 and 18 returned from china to begin work 
this week 
it was determined by the us government that they are 
needed said lt cmdr edward lundquist a pentagon spokesman

defense department the state department the white house and 
national security council 
project peace pearl which will sell advanced avionics equipment 
to the chinese for the f8s is still in the development stage the 
scheduled shipment to china of 500 million in equipment is not due

isobel and marion are sisters isobel believes 
in doing the right thing marion believes in doing what she thinks 
is right 
their differences are the foundation of the secret rapture 
david hares fascinating drama about public and private greed that 
opened thursday at broadways ethel barrymore theatre its 
impressive theater directed by the playwright himself in a spare 
nononsense style 
what hare the author of plenty a map of the world and 
pravda has written is a striking morality play in which the 
line between good and evil is fudged distorted by those domestic 
entanglements called family 
the two sisters are brought together at their fathers funeral 
not only must they come to terms with his death they must deal 
with their young alcoholic stepmother katherine 
in london where the play enjoyed a great success at the 
national theatre the secret rapture was taken by many critics 
to be an indictment of margaret thatchers england 
marion is a junior minister in the conservative government her 
husband tom is president of christians in business we try to 
do business the way jesus would have done it he says husband 
and wife have sanctified success in business and in politics 
but the play is more than a political tract primarily because 
of hares treatment of isobel the woman who runs a graphic design 
business is a restless romantic heroine a dogooder with doubts 
she hires her stepmother against the advice of irwin her boyfriend 
and employee and then she reluctantly agrees to have her company 
purchased by toms conglomerate only to learn that irwin already 
has defected to her brotherinlaw 
these decisions have disastrous consequences both 
professionally and personally for isobel she willingly enters 
into the agreements shes not a pushover coerced into action but 
what makes isobel different from the other characters is that she 
has qualms about what she does 
marion has another side too shes ruthless and selfpitying 
but you can sympathize with her feelings when she complains that 
isobel makes her feel as if shes always wrong we cant all be 
perfect marion snaps we do try 
hares dialogue is literate witty and at times moving there 
is a sadness around the edges of the play that never really comes 
to the forefront until the final curtain by then its devastating 
designer santo loquasto captures this melancholy in his striking 
sets particularly a red autumnal backdrop lighted by richard 
nelson 
hare has written three smashing roles for women and his 
challenge is ably met in this production in the central role of 
isobel blair brown radiates a goodness that is believable a 
goodness rooted more in honesty than in saintliness 
frances conroy her hair swirled tightly around her head looks 
like a cross between mrs thatcher and princess anne her wonderful 
portrait of the ambitious marion is cold astringent and deadly 
accurate and mary beth hurt excels as the devious acidtongued 
katherine who wants sympathy but rarely offers any of her own 
there is strong support in secondary roles from stephen vinovich 
as tom the smug christian businessman whos building a swimming 
pool in his back yard to baptize converts michael wincott as 
isobels distraught boyfriend and jennifer van dyck as marions 
predatory assistant 
after a swift burst of violence the secret rapture ends 
enigmatically with one of the sisters left alone on stage it 
amounts to a reconciliation of sorts although the playwright never 
settles who was right and who was wrong but then thats real 
life and maybe one of the reasons the secret rapture is such a 
rich and satisfying play 
the play opened to mostly unfavorable reviews with critics 
lamenting a loss between the british and us productions the new 
york post said what in london was poetic on broadway is 
obscurantist pretentious and annoying 
new york newsday called it a flawed but fascinating 
drama while the daily news said the play was too calculated too 
schematic the new york times said the passion and wit that 
reside in his hares script are left unrealized in this 
production

a court ruled today that a british tourist 
who died last year in a game reserve was murdered rejecting the 
governments contention that she was devoured by animals 
i think the animals are innocent said chief magistrate 
joseph mango ruling in the case of 28yearold julie ward 
ms wards partly charred lower left leg and lower jaw were 
found sept 13 1988 in the sprawling masai mara game reserve a 
week after she reportedly left the park 
her partly burned personal belongings and ashes also were found 
near the remains 5 miles from her abandoned vehicle 
there is ample and substantial evidence that julie ward died 
of foul play by a person or persons unknown mango concluded 
but he said he saw no reason to direct the attorney 
generals office to further investigate her death and rejected 
claims by ms wards family that the state engaged in a massive 
coverup either to protect her assassin or kenyas lucrative tourist 
industry 
there has been a strong attack on the quality of the 
investigations and allegations of a coverup said mango of 
course the state does not admit this 
he further denied that simon makallah the masai maras chief 
game warden is a principle suspect in ms wards slaying 
ms wards father john ward and his attorney byron 
georgiadis pointed to makallah as a suspect they allege she was 
killed by someone who knew the game park well who had freedom of 
movement there and who could have ordered or inspired a coverup of 
the circumstances surrounding her disappeareance 
makallah found ms wards remains within hours after her vehicle 
was located georgiadis alleged he was able to do that only because 
he already knew where they were 
mango said however there was no evidence to suggest makallah 
and ms ward ever met before her death and that he found her 
remains does not cast suspicion on makallah 
instead he said investigators should consider as prime suspects 
two men ms ward spent time with in the game park neither of whom 
appeared as witnesses during the inquest 
the ruling ended an inquiry that began in midaugust and ran 
intermittently until oct 6 
the inquest largely was the result of pressure from ms wards 
father who has spent tens of thousands of dollars and hundreds of 
hours trying to prove his daughter was murdered 
ward a wealthy hotelier from suffolk england saidit is a 
credit to kenya that they came up with this verdict ward 
maintained however there was a coverup

prime minister tadeusz mazowiecki told 
warsaw pact diplomats today that they should put less emphasis on 
their alliances military role and improve economic ties to reflect 
the great changes in the east bloc 
mazowiecki the first noncommunist leader of a soviet bloc 
nation also sought to assure his communist allies that the 
democratic changes taking place in poland posed no danger to their 
alliance 
mazowiecki made the comments during a toast at a dinner for 
foreign ministers and foreign trade ministers attending a twoday 
warsaw pact meeting in the capital 
he called for radically restructuring comecon the 
organization that coordinates economic relations among the seven 
pact countries and stressed the need to respect the internal 
sovereignty of pact nations 
these principles take on particular significance at the 
present time of changes going on in many of our countries he 
said apparently referring to reforms in hungary and the soviet 
union and the beginnings of reform in east germany 
the gathering is the first warsaw pact meeting to be held in 
poland since solidarity took control of the government in august 
other members of the warsaw pact are bulgaria romania and 
czechoslovakia 
our reforms pose no threat to anybody and violate nobodys 
interests he said on the contrary the changes that are going 
on in poland now lead to normalizing the internal situation and 
thus indirectly to stability of european relations 
poland is true to her commitments as an ally and fulfills her 
duties stemming from this 
poland wants to expand and improve political and defense 
cooperation in the warsaw pact as well as economic scientific and 
technical cooperation in comecon mazowiecki said 
but at the same time europe should be less divided he said 
a return to the unity of europe means not only the common 
heritage of culture and civilization but also the need for joint 
development of conditions of detente and peace mazowiecki said 
urging changes within the pact itself he said the warsaw 
treaty cannot lag behind the current of transformations we must 
not lose sight of the vision of a world free from opposed military 
blocs 
he said that system should be replaced by by an efficient 
system of collective security a vision that was outlined in the 
un charter in 1945 
today it is important to put emphasis on the political instead 
of the military roles of the treaties 
giving the answering toast was foreign minister ioan totu of 
romania a country whose leaders tried unsuccessfully to rally 
warsaw pact nations in august to prevent solidaritys government 
takeover 
totu stressed the need for noninterference in the internal 
affairs of other countries 
apparently referring to repeated western calls for human rights 
improvements in some east bloc countries particularly romania he 
said imperialist reactionary circles resort to actions and 
attempts at interference in the affairs of socialist states and 
their destabilization 
it is necessary to reject actions of this kind as flagrantly 
discordant with the 1975 helsinki accords and the un charter

a leading newspaper said today that a top adviser 
to ousted communist party chief zhao ziyang blocked publication of 
a collection of speeches and sayings by senior leader deng xiaoping 
the collection deng xiaoping on literature and the arts 
was issued thursday at a ceremony at the great hall of the people 
and acclaimed by the new culture minister he jingzi as a great 
event in cultural and publishing circles 
a top party official li ruihuan said the books would be of 
great help in eradicating the influence of western liberal ideas 
and he urged artists and writers to study them to unify 
thinking 
in a frontpage editorial the guangming daily said the 
collection was put together two years ago 
because of obstruction from bao tong who grasped some power 
then it could not be published then it said 
bao was a key adviser to zhao and director of the partys 
research center for the reform of the political structure he is 
believed to be under arrest 
if deng had personally wanted the collection to be published 
earlier it is highly unlikely bao would have been able to stop it 
zhao was ousted from his party posts in june after losing a 
power struggle triggered by student prodemocracy protests other 
party officials accused him of supporting the protests and 
splitting the party he has not been seen in public since 
the publication of the collection is part of an effort since the 
protests to lionize deng as a wise leader on a par with 
revolutionary leader mao tsetung 
the collections title echoes that of a famous 1942 speech by 
mao on literature and the arts which codified party policy 
that the arts must serve socialism 
the guangming daily said deng xiaopings important 
composition on literature and the arts is the guiding principle to 
prosper and develop socialist literature and the arts 
it said the writings criticized extreme individualism nihilism 
anarchism abstract humanitarianism theories of alienation under 
socialism moneyworship pornography and all kinds of corrupted 
thought and capitalist lifestyles 
under former culture minister wang meng a writer who lost his 
post in september the government had stressed the need for 
artistic freedom 
in contrast a recent peoples daily editorial said chinese 
literature in recent years has become wilder than ever before 
as writers imitate western bourgeois literary phenomena such as 
black humor symbolism expressionism surrealism the fantasy 
school stream of consciousness imagism and so on 
it said writers have a lofty mission to write about socialist 
realities and the beauty of human nature

a lawyer for two people whose trial on child 
molestation charges is the longest in us history has finally 
completed his case pleading with the jury not to believe the 
sexually graphic testimony of youngsters 
you can still love children and still want to believe them 
but in a courtroom you cant rely on them attorney danny davis 
said thursday as he finished his closing argument 
davis represents raymond buckey 30 and his mother peggy 
mcmartin buckey 62 both are charged with 65 counts of molestation 
and conspiracy involving 11 children at the nowdefunct mcmartin 
preschool in manhattan beach 
the first arrests in the case came six years ago the trial of 
buckey and his mother has lasted about 2 years the longest trial 
in us history charges against five others eventually were 
dismissed 
nine children testified about alleged sexual abuse davis called 
them lovely rehearsed children who were led to believe they 
were molested when nothing really happened 
davis said the children memorized their testimony after 
interviews by therapists and coaching by prosecutors 
he also questioned the testimony of george freeman an admitted 
perjurer and jailhouse informant who said buckey confessed to child 
molestations while the two shared a cell 
you should not reward people who bring in perjurers and shaped 
children davis said did ray buckey have to prove his 
innocence because the evidence the prosecutors looked for to 
prove otherwise was not there hes entitled to the benefit of the 
doubt 
superior court judge william pounders imposed a limit of 6 days 
for each side to give closing arguments to expedite the case and 
reduce the possibility of a mistrial 
the defense took all its time for closing arguments after three 
days of closing statements from the prosecution prosecutors saved 
3 days and will now use the time to rebut davis

ukrainian miners will meet next week to decide 
whether to go on strike to protest what they say is the 
governments failure to abide by promises made during strikes last 
summer a representative said today 
the ukraines donetsk basin the soviet unions largest 
coalproducing area and other coal regions were paralyzed by the 
summer strikes miners went back to work after the kremlin promised 
to meet virtually all their demands for better working conditions 
improved supplies of consumer goods and more financial independence 
but ukrainian miners representatives say those promises have 
not been kept they voted thursday against immediately resuming the 
giant strike but decided to poll workers to see how much support 
there was for renewing it 
alexander nikolaevich tupikin a member of the donetsk strike 
committee said by telephone that the decisions of all individual 
mines and work shifts should be known by tuesday 
on that day a council representing workers from throughout the 
region will meet sum up all the opinions and decide what the 
next step should be he said 
soviet officials have said a renewed round of miners strikes 
could force a rationing of heat and light as the winter sets in 
because of a reduction of coal 
earlier this month the supreme soviet legislature passed a law 
banning strikes in such vital areas as energy defense and 
transport 
the law didnt stop 18000 miners in the northern region of 
vorkuta from holding a oneday strike thursday to demand the 
kremlin make good on the promised benefits as well as end the 
communist partys monopoly on power 
the strikers decided to return to work at all but one mine after 
hearings on the illegal strike began in regional court vorkuta

south africa and israel are cooperating on 
several programs to develop ballistic missiles including one with 
nuclear weapon potential a us official says 
the official speaking on condition of anonymity said 
intelligence reports indicated that south africa last summer tested 
a modified version of the israelimade jericho ii mediumrange 
missile at armaston on the indian ocean coast near capetown 
israel testfired its own jericho ii missile over the 
mediterranean last year he said both missiles have a 900mile 
range 
the two countries which have had an extensive defense 
relationship since the 1960s also are cooperating in the 
development of a longrange missile that could be used to launch 
reconnaissance satellites into space the official said 
a longrange version of the jericho known as the shavit which 
is hebrew for comet was used to launch an israeli 
photoreconnaissance satellite earlier this year from the negev 
desert the official said media reports then described the rocket 
as a multistage missile having a 2000mile range 
responding to reports about the nuclear cooperation the state 
department urged israel to sign the international nuclear 
nonproliferation treaty which it has refused to do for fear of 
opening its facilities to international inspection 
we have repeatedly urged israel and other nonsignatories to 
join the pact the department said in statement issued late 
thursday we reiterate that call 
both israel and south africa have denied they are sharing such 
technology 
i bear no knowledge whatsoever of such cooperation said 
south african foreign minister pik botha 
in jerusalem today prime minister yitzhak shamir said the 
reports of israelisouth african nuclear cooperation were designed 
to tear the fabric of usisraeli relations at a time when 
israel was trying to bridge differences with secretary of state 
james a baker iii about peace talks with palestinians 
under intense us pressure israel announced in 1987 that it 
would not sign any new defense contracts with south africa but 
would honor existing ones 
the state department and the pentagon refused to discuss the 
matter 
we do not comment on intelligence matters the us policy of 
opposition to the proliferation of missiles and nuclear weapons is 
well known said state department spokeswoman margaret tutwiler 
ms tutwiler said the us ambassador in israel had brought up 
similar reports of nuclear proliferation with israel in the past 
israel turned down the protest of former ambassador thomas 
pickering the washington post reported in todays editions 
and when a senior state department official brought up the issue 
with a visiting israeli delegation last spring he was stiffed 
just absolutely stiffed on it the post quoted an unidentified 
source as saying 
israel and south africa reportedly also are cooperating on 
development of a south african jet fighter known as the cheetah it 
is a modified version of the israeli lavi fighter that was scrapped 
under strong us pressure in the final stages of its development 
two years ago 
the assistant secretary of state for african affairs herman 
cohen indirectly confirmed recently that there had been some 
cooperation between the two countries on intermediaterange 
missiles 
israel has pledged to phase out its defense ties with south 
africa cohen said in a television interview but added i am 
assuming cooperation of intermediate range ballistic missiles comes 
under existing contracts 
nbctv reported that south africa was providing israel with 
enriched uranium for its own nuclear warheads neither country has 
admitted having nuclear weapons

the army blocked three 
christian bishops from delivering truckloads of food today to a 
christian arab town closed by military order because of its boycott 
of israeli taxes 
the bishops and two other highranking religious leaders also 
abandoned plans to visit the town of beit sahour minus the food 
trucks when army officers insisted a military escort had to 
accompany them 
beit sahour near bethlehem has been the scene of a major 
confrontation between israeli authorities and residents boycotting 
israeli taxes as part of the 22month uprising against the 
occupation of the west bank and gaza strip 
the town with a mostly christian population of 10000 has been 
closed to outsiders much of the time since sept 20 when the 
government began confiscating property in raids aimed at breaking 
the tax boycott 
the religious leaders included the jerusalem patriarchs or 
bishops of the roman catholic greek orthodox and armenian 
churches accompanying them were representatives of the greek 
catholic sect and the franciscan religious order 
the churchmen had hoped to pray in beit sahour and meet with the 
mayor said roman catholic patriarch michel sabbah 
they the soldiers did not let us do our humanitarian 
duties sabbah complained 
greek orthodox patriarch diodoros i called the incident an 
insult to our ranks and our rights through the ages to worship in 
the holy land the spokesman for the group said 
an army spokesman said the three trucks of sugar rice flour 
and cooking oil were blocked because the town is a closed 
military area where nonresidents cannot enter while the town is 
believed to have some shortages there is no threat of starvation 
army officials also said officers felt the religious leaders and 
their aides totaling about 20 people could provoke an incident in 
beit sahour 
the three bishops rejected an army offer to allow them to enter 
the christian town with a military escort for their own safety 
the bishops said god will protect us but the commander of 
the area responsible for their safety felt it would be unwise 
said the army spokesman who is not identified under military 
regulations 
when told they would not be allowed into the town the religious 
leaders went to the church of nativity in bethlehem and prayed for 
beit sahour the church bells were rung to show solidarity with the 
nearby town 
the prayers at the church that is regarded by tradition as the 
birthplace of christ represented a rare show of unity since 
christian sects often squabble over their rights to the church and 
other religious sites 
meanwhile police said they were investigating the fatal 
shooting thursday of an 18yearold bethlehem youth naeem karim 
daamseh 
daamseh was shot in the neck by a policeman after he ignored a 
police order to stop struck a policeman with his car and was 
pursued by a police van police officials said 
police spokesman mordechai bareket denied a palestinian witness 
charge that police pistol whipped daamseh and shot him at close 
range 
israelis have killed 605 palestinians since the uprising began 
in december 1987 fellow arabs have slain an additional 136 
palestinians most on suspicion of collaborating with israel forty 
israelis also have died

the white house and the senate intelligence 
committee agree on liberalized conditions for future us 
involvement in coup attempts aimed at ousting panamanian dictator 
manuel noriega the panels chairman says 
the bush administration and the senate panel reached a meeting 
of the minds at meetings over the past two weeks culminating in 
a detailed session thursday with representatives of the cia the 
pentagon and the state department said senate committee chairman 
david boren dokla 
boren said his understanding is that us officials will be free 
to counsel and consult with potential coup plotters so long as the 
plot does not specifically set out to assassinate noriega 
also on thursday the intelligence panel approved a bill 
authorizing intelligence activities for the next two years and 
settling a longrunning dispute over how the president reports 
clandestine overseas operations to congress 
the committee dropped a proposal to force such disclosures 
within an absolute 48hour limit after bush agreed to put in 
writing his policies on informing congress 
presidential spokesman marlin fitzwater speaking to reporters 
today on air force one en route to costa rica said bush will send 
a letter to congress as early as next week formalizing the 
agreement to notify lawmakers within a few days of any covert 
operation 
bush doesnt believe in having an artificial deadline to 
carry out his foreign policy duties fitzwater said 
the compromise followed nine months of negotiations and 
essentially restored the understandings on reporting covert 
operations that existed 10 years ago before they were tattered by 
the irancontra affair 
boren said the committee held a thorough discussion thursday 
behind closed doors with officials of the cia state department and 
pentagon on the oct 3 failed panama coup and what can be done to 
prepare for any similar situation in the future 
since the coups failure congress and the white house have 
traded accusatios over who was to blame for the lack of us 
preparation administration officials have contended congress tied 
their hands through too strict an interpretation of the 
governments ban on participation in assassinations of foreign 
leaders 
we have removed any ambiguities that may have clouded the 
meaning of the 1976 executive order that bans us participation in 
assassination plots boren said bush is referring the matter to 
the justice department for a new interpretation of the order said 
boren adding we start with a clean slate 
he added no one feels that the executive order prohibiting 
assassinations should be taken to the extreme position that you 
have to warn someone of a coup being plotted against them or that 
you cant participate in planning a coup where assassination is not 
the objective 
on the subject of congressional notification of covert 
operations the panel also dropped a ban on the cias ability to 
use its contingency fund to launch new covert operations which had 
not been reported to congress 
sen william cohen rmaine the intelligence panels vice 
chairman had proposed the 48hour provision after the 
congressional irancontra hearings during which it became clear 
president reagan neglected for more than 10 months to tell the 
intelligence committees of the house and senate that he was selling 
weapons to iran in hopes of winning the release of americans held 
hostage in the middle east 
cohen said bush has promised to give the committees prior notice 
of covert actions on virtually all occasions 
in rare cases when prior notice is not given the president will 
let congress know within a few days cohen said and should the 
president let notification slip beyond that time period he will do 
so only with an assertion of constitutional authority that would 
supersede any law written by congress 
no president would make such an assertion lightly and risk the 
kind of situation that confronted reagan in the irancontra 
scandal he said it almost undid the reagan presidency he 
said and if it happens again im sure it will undo a future 
one 
this essentially puts us back to the understanding we had in 
1980 before reagan took office cohen said 
he called the agreement the best that could be arranged 
congress would likely have been able to force the strict 48hour 
limit into the bill but would have been unable to override a 
virtually certain presidential veto cohen said 
the bill also writes into the law for the first time 
requirements that all covert operations be authorized by a 
presidential decision document known as a finding before they 
are carried out and that the document specify which agencies and 
other countries if any are to be involved 
and it would create for the first time an independent inspector 
general at the cia to be appointed by the president and confirmed 
by the senate such an independent investigator would improve 
internal cia management and the ability of congress to perform its 
oversight job the committee concluded 
a housepassed version of the intelligence bill does not include 
the independent inspector general provision but instead specifies 
that the oversight committees must be given complete access to 
investigation and audit reports conducted under the current 
arrangement

consumer spending in september posted its 
weakest advance in a year while americans personal income grew a 
lackluster 03 percent the government said today in a report 
raising new concern about the health of the economy 
the commerce department said consumer spending rose 02 percent 
last month it was the most sluggish figure since september 1988 
when it fell 01 percent and followed more robust increases of 09 
percent in august and 08 percent in july 
the income growth of 03 percent followed an identical advance 
in august and a 06 percent gain in july 
the statistics on americans income growth and spending habits 
provided fresh evidence that the economy is continuing to slow as 
measured by the gross national product the economy grew at a 
moderate 25 percent in the julyseptember quarter but few 
economists expect it to match that pace in the last three months of 
the year with a handful saying the nation could slip into a 
recession 
other signs of weakness in the month include a decline of 
103000 manufacturing jobs and a slight drop in orders for big 
ticket durable goods 
however the government noted that hurricane hugo which struck 
north and south carolina in september reduced personal income with 
most of the decline coming in rental income without te storm 
incomes would have risen twice as much 06 percent 
overall personal income in september totaled 447 trillion at 
a seasonally adjusted annual rate following a revised rate of 446 
trillion a month earlier 
spending came in at an annual rate of 353 trillion following a 
revised 352 trillion in august 
the september report showed americans income after taxes rose 
only 02 percent down from the 03 percent gain in august 
with income growing at the same rate as aftertax income 
americans savings rate held steady at 49 percent the same as in 
august but significantly less than the 56 percent rate in july 
the key component of the income category wages and salaries 
increased 144 billion compared with a rise of 57 billion in 
august hurricane hugo reduced wages and salaries by about 2 
billion 
the storm reduced rental income by 9 billion because uninsured 
losses are deducted as an expense when figuring rental income 
on the spending side the 87 billion increase in personal 
consumption spending which includes everything except interest 
payments on debt compared with a 33 billion increase in august 
purchases of durable goods items expected to last three or more 
years dropped 61 billion while nondurable goods purchases 
increased 36 billion spending on services rose 113 billion

a un official who resigned amid allegations of 
financial impropriety denied any wrongdoing today and said he 
stepped down because repeated attacks had made his job increasingly 
difficult 
it is quite clear that the function of the high commissioner 
requires a total commitment and availability to act to convince 
and to galvanize said jeanpierre hocke who resigned thursday 
as un high commissioner for refugees 
such commitment had been reduced by repeated and irresponsible 
attacks he said these were the considerations that led to my 
resignation which should not be seen as a withdrawal in the middle 
of the storm 
hockes resignation was announced in new york after un 
secretary general javier perez de cuellar ordered a broadened 
inquiry into allegations that hocke misused agency funds to 
subsidize firstclass air travel 
calling a news conference only hours after his return from new 
york hocke read a handwritten statement saying his resignation 
does not reflect any sentiment of culpability on my part 
concerning any of my doings 
he said the agency would face a formidable challenge in the 
next few months when refugee protection and assistance will be more 
difficult than ever 
such tasks he said could be tackled only with an open mind 
which he said he may no longer have because of the destructive 
intentions of some people here and elsewhere he did not 
elaborate 
switching between french and english in answering questions he 
said he did not feel to have been pressured 
the high commissioner is responsible for at least 12 million 
refugees worldwide although there are many more than that a 
separate un agency helps palestinian refugees 
hockes latest problems began in september when swiss 
television reported that internal documents showed he had drawn 
300000 since 1987 from a special educational fund set up by 
sweden and denmark to fly first class instead of business class 
hocke admitted he had flown first class a right reserved only 
for perez de cuellar under stringent un austerity measures but 
denied any impropriety

a bomb exploded on a street in medellin 
as a bus carrying policemen passed by killing five officers and 
wounding 16 police said 
three more bombs exploded thursday night and early today in the 
capital of bogota wounding one person and another bomb in bogota 
was deactivated thursday night at a bank police said 
also thursday two policemen assigned as guards to the 
ecuadorian consulate in medellin were shot and killed as they tried 
to help another policeman make an arrest police in the city said 
they blamed street thugs and said the killers escaped 
no one claimed responsibility for the bus attack late thursday 
but police blamed drug barons angered by the governments refusal 
to negotiate its policy of extraditing traffickers to the united 
states 
the traffickers are the only criminals with the means and the 
desire to carry out an attack of this size said a police 
spokesman in medellin the center of colombias drug trade 
in the two months since the government declared a war on 
traffickers and the drug lords responded with violent attacks 169 
bombings attributed to the traffickers have killed 21 people and 
injured 219 
the latest attacks came a day after the country suffered its 
worst rebel violence in two years with guerrillas storming two 
northeastern towns and slaying at least six people according to 
army reports 
the bomb in medellin packing over 60 pounds of dynamite was 
placed on a curb and detonated as the bus passed national rcn 
radio said 44 officers were on the bus at the time 
the driver and four others died in the explosion which severely 
damaged the bus and sent it reeling out of control the police 
spokesman said on condition of anonymity many of the 16 injured 
were in critical condition he said 
the bus finally stopped when it smashed into a parked taxi the 
spokesman said the right side of the bus was riddled with shrapnel 
from the bomb a medellin police spokeswoman said 
the bomb was connected with electrical cable to a plunger two 
blocks away the spokeswoman said speaking on condition of 
anonymity 
the vehicle was carrying police officers to their posts for 
night duty the attack stirred panic in medellins residential 
neighborhood of bello horizonte 
the terrorists fired automatic rifles as they fled and people 
panicked because they thought the neighborhood was under attack 
a police spokesman said 
in bogota police said three terrorists threw a bomb packing 10 
pounds of dynamite at a telephone office from a passing car one 
person was injured in the blast which broke the windows of houses 
a block away 
hours later unidentifed assailants in a taxi placed a 40pound 
bomb outside a bank in southern bogota the blast damaged the bank 
but caused no injuries 
and shortly after midnight this morning a third bomb exploded at 
another bogota bank a communique from the national police said 
the attacks appeared to be in retaliation for the governments 
extradition policy the supreme court this week reaffirmed an 
earlier ruling that extradition was constitutional and president 
virgilio barco pledged to continue 
barco has said the government will not negotiate with 
traffickers who until the crackdown received relative impunity by 
intimidating or paying off judges 
the government has extradited four drug suspects since it began 
a crackdown against the traffickers aug 19 a day after drug lords 
assassinated leading presidential candidate luis carlos galan nine 
alleged traffickers are awaiting extradition 
colombias socalled medellin and cali drug cartels are thought 
responsible for supplying 80 percent of the cocaine sold in the 
united states 
the army blamed wednesdays rebel violence on the national 
liberation army a shadowy procuban organization 
the attacks were the bloodiest since 1987 when more than 50 
people were killed during one month of fighting

a leading member of the soviet parliament said 
today new legislation is being drafted to limit the power of 
president mikhail s gorbachev to send the red army into conflicts 
in other countries 
referring to the 1979 invasion of afghanistan the new chairman 
of the supreme soviets council of union yevgeny m primakov said 
there can be no decision of that sort without the involvement 
of the legislative body 
he said the invasion was executed by a small group of officials 
without the participation of the supreme soviet there can be no 
repetition primakov said in answering questions after a speech 
at the brookings institution a private research facility 
the chairman of the council of union the legislative upper and 
dominant house is visiting washington as head of a soviet 
delegation at the invitation of sens george mitchell of maine and 
bob dole of kansas the democratic and republican leaders of the 
senate 
all international activity will have to go through the supreme 
soviet primakov said in his speech 
he likened the legislation in prepartion to the us war powers 
act which restricts american presidents in sending troops abroad 
while providing considerable leeway in the event of selfdeclared 
emergencies 
earlier this week soviet foreign minister eduard a 
shevardnadze acknowledged in a moscow speech that the invasion was 
a mistake the last of some 100000 soviet troops who fought 
alongside the afghan army of marxist president najibullah against 
usarmed rebels left the country last february 
soviet weapons are still being provided to the kabul government 
while the united states has continued to back the rebels in a 
regional dispute with moscow that runs counter to a general 
improvement in superpower relations 
on another foreign policy issue primakov said east germans 
like people everywhere have the right of free choice in 
shaping their government 
however he was skeptical of recent us statements of support 
for reunification with west germany as unlikely to contribute to 
international stability 
the soviet delegation met for 40 minutes thursday with secretary 
of state james a baker iii and other state department officials 
the parliament is the first chosen in competitive elections in 70 
years under new rules engineered by gorbachev 
baker underscored us interest in the institutionalization of 
respect for human rights through enactment of new laws by the 
supreme soviet the state department said in a statement after the 
meeting 
he stressed particular interest in a new soviet emigration law 
that could lead to a waiver of export restrictions under the 
jacksonvanick amendment the statement said 
mitchell also said the delegation had asked him about the 
possibility of granting a temporary waiver of restrictions on 
soviet exports to the united states the soviet union is barred 
from receiving mostfavorednation trading status and the lower 
tariffs that come with it because of its past restrictive 
emigration policies 
primakov said the emigration law is being considered by the 
supreme soviet but that enactment could be delayed by other 
pressing business 
baker reaffirmed us support for reconstruction of the soviet 
economy and our readiness to provide technical advice as 
soviets try to introduce a more marketoriented economy as part of 
its perestroika reforms 
primakov told baker that the soviets welcomed us support and 
were seeking to borrow from our experience in such areas as 
taxation inflation and antitrust 
separate meetings held on economic reform the political 
situation in moscow and environmental and scientific issues 
when the delegation appeared on the senate floor mitchell spoke 
of the common legislative problems that face both the soviet 
lawmakers and their us counterparts 
the visiting lawmakers arrived in the midst of congress annual 
tussle over money bills featuring hot debates on abortion taxes 
the death penalty and aid to poland and hungary two eastbloc 
countries that are emerging from under soviet domination 
you will witness strong differences of opinion and 
vigorous debate between our parties and among our members dole 
said in a welcoming statement it is glasnost american style 
after two days of meetings in washington the group was to go to 
maine on saturday where it was to visit bangor portland and the 
ll bean clothing store in freeport 
on sunday the delegation was to see tourist attractions in 
dodge city kan and attend a town meeting next week will include 
a tour of the worlds largest grain elevator at hutchinson kan a 
trip to a cattle and wheat farm in haven kan and visits to los

revoked their east german citizenship the east german state news 
agency adn reported they were given 24 hours to leave the country 
and the exodus began at about 830 am thursday 
stripping them of their citizenship in prague allowed the 
refugees to travel straight to west germany without having to pass 
through their communist homeland

germanys prague embassy were allowed to leave but were taken by 
train through east german territory so that they could be formally

the death rate from colon and rectal cancer is 
highest along an arc from maine to iowa say government researchers 
who are puzzled by the finding 
the national centers for disease control said thursday the 
highest mortality rates from colorectal cancer in 1986 occurred in 
the northeast and the eastern northcentral states in virtually 
every state from maine with a death rate of 258 per 100000 
people south to maryland with 272 and across to iowa with 248 
nationwide the death rate from colorectal cancer in 1986 was 
231 per 100000 people 
the district of columbia had the nations highest mortality 
rate 321 wyoming had the lowest rate at 162 the atlantabased 
cdc reported 
in the northeast only connecticut at 245 delaware at 238 
and vermont at 224 had colorectal cancer death rates below 25 
per 100000 other high rates were recorded in new hampshire 261 
massachusetts 263 new york 273 new jersey 271 rhode 
island 287 pennsylvania 266 ohio 264 indiana 259 and 
illinois 256 no other state exceeded 24 
we dont know enough about the risk factors or their 
distribution to say why that region is one with the highest 
rates said dr robert a hahn a cdc cancer specialist we 
doubt its just a matter of physical environment but we just dont 
know 
although few risk factors for colorectal cancer have been firmly 
established the cdc said evidence points to highfat diets as 
risky and suggests that eating fruits and vegetables may help 
protect against the disease 
obesity and a highcalorie diet also may increase the risk and 
exercise may lower it the cdc said 
an estimated 145000 colorectal cancer cases are diagnosed in 
the united states each year hahn said 
in 1986 55811 americans died of the disease accounting for 12 
percent of all cancer deaths 
hahn said incidence of the disease has risen somewhat in recent 
years from a rate of 493 cases per 100000 americans in 1979 to 
505 in 1986 but mortality has dropped from 248 deaths per 
100000 in 1979 to 231 in 1986 
detection of disease at an earlier stage might account for 
some of the increase in survival the cdc said 
stool blood screening a relatively cheap technique is useful 
for detecting the disease in its early stages the cdc said 
the case rate in 1986 was 61 per 100000 for men compared with 
43 per 100000 for women 
the median age at which the disease is diagnosed from 1982 to 
1986 was 71 years for cancer of the colon and 69 for rectal cancer 
just three in 100000 30 to 34yearolds developed colorectal 
cancer compared to 532 in 100000 in the 85andolder category

fbi scientists were unable to find conclusive 
evidence that the explosion that killed 47 sailors aboard the uss 
iowa was deliberate a bureau spokesman said today but the navy 
stood by its conclusion that the explosion was ignited by a bomb 
we didnt find anything that would lead us to conclude that a 
device was used to prematurely detonate the charge said fbi 
spokesman mike kortan 
thats not to say something wasnt there he added our 
findings were inconclusive 
cmdr mark baker a navy spokesman said the service is 
convinced that foreign material was found in a band of the guns 
projectile 
we are confident about the sophistication of our equipment and 
the expertise of our technical personnel who conducted the 
thousands of tests for the study baker said 
earlier this month the navy said the explosion was most 
probably caused by a checmically ignited explosive device that 
detonated powder bags in the breech of one of the battleships 
16inch guns 
but on thursday rep nicholas mavroules dmass chairman of 
the house armed services investigative subcommittee said i 
seriously question the conclusion that it was a wrongful 
intentional act 
the navy said gunners mate clayton hartwig was most likely 
responsible for the april explosion the navy said hartwig was a 
loner who was upset about the breakup of a friendship with another 
sailor 
a foreign material was found in a ring inside the barrel of 
the gun according to the navy investigation 
mavroules wrote in a letter to rep mary rose oakar dohio 
that the fbis investigation did not turn up the same evidence 
the fbis lab report has been described by some as 
inconclusive mavroules wrote i do not see it that way it 
clearly says that they did not find elements that the navy 
technicians said they found why is there this discrepancy 
lt melody bock a navy spokeswoman also said the service 
stands by its report 
we cant comment on the fbis equipment or technology she 
said we trust our investigators we trust that what they found 
is correct 
oakar who represents hartwigs hometown of cleveland has 
called for a congressional investigation of the explosion saying 
the navy relied on circumstantial evidence and an fbi psychological 
profile that hartwig took his own life and hoped it looked like 
an accident 
in addition other published reports relying on unidentified 
sources said hartwig was a homosexual distraught over another 
sailors rejection of his advances 
mavroules wrote that he doubts both the suicide and homosexual 
angles 
probably as many people said he was not depressed and not 
suicidal as said he had suicidal tendencies mavroules wrote 
only a handful of individuals of the hundreds interviewed 
avowed any knowledge of hartwigs homosexuality he wrote no 
one had any firsthand knowledge

federal drug officials say they have names and 
addresses of thousands of people believed to be growing marijuana 
indoors and they are going after the growers and their illicit 
crops 
we are trying to send the message to all those people in the 
united states who have been cultivating marijuana that they are 
violating the law they will be caught they will be prosecuted 
and if found guilty they will serve time said drug enforcement 
administration spokesman frank shults 
more than 100 people in 46 states along with 65 stores in 22 
states believed to sell equipment intended for use in indoor 
marijuana cultivation were targeted for raids thursday by the dea 
by early today officials had served 26 stores with search 
warrants of which eight were boarded up as a result 73 indoor 
grove operations containing 7635 marijuana plants had been seized 
and 129 people arrested according to a federal enforcement 
official close to the investigation 
the biggest bust of an indoor growing operation took place in 
wichita kan where 1440 marijuana plants were seized followed 
by a raid of a store in san diego where an owner with 600 growing 
plants was arrested according to the source 
the source said not all the offices conducting raids had 
reported their actions to dea headquarters this morning and he 
expected the final numbers to be even higher 
the difference between todays marijuana and 1960s marijuana 
is like comparing near beer to 190 proof alcohol the source said 
in explaining why marijuana growers were being targeted its so 
much more potent you cant imagine 
asked why the potency has increased so much he said because 
americans are the best farmers in the world they grow the best 
marijuana in the world hands down 
doug mcvay of the national organization for the reform of 
marijuana laws said the raids on stores were a publicity stunt 
a largely ineffective one and silly really silly 
a dea statement said the agency has obtained the names and 
addresses of thousands of individuals who are suspected of being 
involved in the indoor cultivation of marijuana 
in the previous month the investigation codenamed operation 
green merchant had resulted in the arrests of 112 people on charges 
of cultivating marijuana at 94 indoor growing locations containing 
17000 plants shults said 
us marijuana growers who produce about 25 percent of the 
supply increasingly have been moving their plants indoors because 
of extensive aerial surveillance that enables officials to spot 
drugs grown outside 
the stores raided specialize in the sale of these otherwise 
legitimate products with the knowledge that they will be used to 
cultivate marijuana shults said 
the dea used undercover agents in every store targeted for raids 
thursday to determine whether the operators knew the equipment 
such as lighting irrigation and ventilation apparatus was being 
used for indoor marijuana cultivation said the source who spoke 
on condition of anonymity 
the stores raided range from momandpop to something 
equivalent to a kmart the source said some of them have 
fairly large warehouses these are all stores targeting the 
marijuana subculture in the united states as their customers and 
do little advertising in mainstream publications 
we have established through the advertising and other means 
that these stores do sell the indoor cultivation apparatus and give 
advice about its use for the cultivation of marijuana shults 
said they openly do it 
it was not immediately clear where the dea got the names and 
addresses of the thousands of people suspected of growing marijuana 
indoors 
steve hager the editor of new york citybased high times 
magazine stressed that law enforcement did not get the 
publications mailing list 
however he said i believe that they subpoenaed the ups 
united parcel service shipping records of our advertisers and 
have been using that information to build a conspiracy case of some 
kind 
ups spokesman al winnik said he knew nothing of such subpoenas 
theres no word here of any subpoenas by dea or any agency of 
that type 
the dea would not comment except to say there was an ongoing 
investigation 
shults said no publications such as high times magazine were 
targets of thursdays raids 
i can understand the deas frustration mcvay said its 
true some of this equipment is being used for indoor marijuana 
cultivation on the other hand dirt is used for indoor 
cultivation i dont think were going to stop people from selling 
dirt 
legitimate manufacturers such as general electric and sylvania 
sell lights used for growing plants indoors and rubbermaid sells a 
kit of indoor gardening equipment mcvay said 
these stores and this technology was around way before people 
thought about growing pot indoors he said 
the stores targeted for raids thursday were located in alaska 
arizona california colorado georgia illinois kentucky 
massachusetts michigan minnesota missouri new york north 
carolina ohio oklahoma oregon pennsylvania south carolina 
texas virginia washington and wisconsin 
raids on indoor cultivation sites were planned for all states 
except hawaii nebraska north dakota and west virginia according 
to the justice department

yuri khodjaev who oversees film festivals in moscow leningrad

the conference at john carroll university said ronald holloway 
director of the first cleveland film conference 
denying a visa to yuri khodjaev who has traveled to the 
united states many times in the past is a great embarrassment for 
us americans holloway said thursday 
francis jones spokeswoman in consular affairs in the state 
department told the cleveland plain dealer that the government 
would comment on the matter today 
it is a stupid thing to deny free access to khodjaev or anyone

exxon corps headquarters shift to a dallas 
suburb should inspire city officials to work even harder to hold on 
to other large companies fleeing to lowercost markets an analyst 
says 
the move announced thursday involves only 300 jobs but should 
not be ignored by new york said dennis donovan a business 
relocation consultant 
i would say that certainly any city that loses a corporate 
headquarters ought to be worried about it particularly when 
theyre moving from highcost locations to lowcost locations he 
said 
the city has responded to past corporate flights with 
incentives including a 100 million package offered nbc when it 
considered moving to new jersey about two years ago 
other companies that decided to stay after getting breaks 
include chase manhattan drexel burnham lambert american telephone 
amp telegraph shearson lehman hutton and citicorp 
but there are other corporations that will consider leaving 
and new york ought to do everything it can to hold on to them 
donovan said 
the exxon announcement follows word from jc penney co inc 
and mobil corp that they were moving headquarters out of new york 
city 
stanley grayson deputy mayor for finance and economic 
development points to 4500 new companies that have come to the 
city in the past 10 years 
although exxon is certainly a major company in new york in 
the country and the world the practical matter is they employed 
300 people here he said 
the move comes near the end of one of the most tumultuous years 
in exxon history marked by the march 24 oil spill by a company 
tanker in alaskas prince william sound exxon the worlds largest 
oil company has been criticized harshly for what some saw as its 
inadequate response to the disaster 
exxons decision to go to las colinas a real estate development 
in the dallas suburb of irving had texas boosters tickled 
pink as mike murphy a spokesman for the texas department of 
commerce put it 
exxons corporate headquarters once had up to 4000 people but 
the number remaining in new york had been steadily reduced since 
exxon moved its international business operations to florham park 
nj 
the companys domestic operations are based in houston 
the texas economy has been battered since the mid1980s when 
the price of oil dropped to almost 10 a barrel and scuttled a real 
estate boom fueled by expectations of 50abarrel oil 
this confirms what weve been trying to say to the rest of the 
world for some time that texas is on the rise again murphy said

former hud secretary samuel pierce today 
declared i committed no illegal or wrongful acts while in 
office but he again refused to answer questions from congress 
about scandals in federal housing programs during his tenure 
rep tom lantos dcalif said his subcommittees hud 
investigation would end after several scheduled hearings and he 
would not offer immunity to two former pierce aides who refused to 
testify 
the subcommittee hearings have demonstrated a colossal 
scandal at hud lantos declared and two panel members said they 
are seeking a special prosecutor to investigate pierce 
the former housing secretary said he was invoking his fifth 
amendment protections against selfincrimination because he 
believed he had unfairly been made a target of the subcommittee 
investigation of influencepeddling fraud and mismanagement at the 
department of housing and urban development 
i believe i committed no illegal or wrongful acts pierce 
said in a statement he read to the subcommittee before refusing to 
answer substantive questions i look forward to the time when 
innuendo and rumors to the contrary are put to rest 
the panel has heard scores of developers and consultants detail 
political favoritism and mismanagement at hud during pierces 
tenure but has heard little from former top agency officials of 
that period 
pierce who headed hud during the entire eight years of the 
reagan administration said he hoped he would soon be able to 
defend himself against allegations he mismanaged agency programs 
and was involved in political favoritism 
i look forward to the day when i can tell my story and i 
assure you i have a story to tell pierce said but he refused to 
do so today contending several members of the subcommittee had 
already judged him guilty of lies and dishonesty 
i am constrained to conclude that an atmosphere has been 
created in which i have become a target of the panels 
investigation he said i have been unfairly accused 
reps charles schumer of new york and bruce morrison of 
connecticut both democrats said they were asking the house 
judiciary committee to formally request the justice department to 
appoint a special prosecutor to investigate pierce 
now its clear sam pierce is stonewalling schumer said 
if were going to get to the bottom of this justice will have to 
appoint a special prosecutor 
pierce appeared before the house government operations 
subcommittee on employment and housing voluntarily in may but his 
appearances today and last month when he first refused to answer 
questions were forced by subpoenas issued by the panel 
he also has been subpoenaed to appear again a week from today 
but lantos said he would cancel that hearing because of pierces 
continued refusal to answer questions 
pierce rejected an offer from lantos to cancel the hearings 
today and next week and vacate the subpoenas in exchange for a 
pledge that the former cabinet member would testify voluntarily 
before thanksgiving 
pierce said he was snubbing the offer at the advice of his 
attorneys 
at the beginning of todays hearing lantos disclosed that 
pierce had asked the government to pay his legal fees but that hud 
has rejected the request 
the scandals at hud during the pierce years have already cost 
the american people billions of dollars lantos said he praised 
new hud secretary jack kemp for rejecting the request that mr 
pierces legal fees at a congressional hearing be paid for by the 
american taxpayer 
lantos also said he believed the subcommittee had legal grounds 
to force pierce to testify because by answering questions in may 
pierce waived his right to refuse later to testify about related 
subjects 
however lantos said the subcommittee would not challenge 
pierces refusal to answer questions a battle that would 
inevitably end up in court 
pierces continued refusal to answer questions leaves the 
sixmonth house investigation at a crossroads three former 
deputies to pierce also have refused to testify leaving the 
subcommittee with scores of accounts from those who did business 
with hud but scant details from those in power 
lantos has mulled giving immunity to two of the former pierce 
assistants including former top aide deborah gore dean but most 
other panel members oppose any immunity grants 
after pierce said today that he would not answer questions about 
his conduct at hud lantos and the handful of congressmen present 
tried anyway the chairman asked several questions and the other 
lawmakers one each 
each time pierce said that on the advice of counsel he was 
invoking his rights under the fifth amendment 
pierce had tried thursday to get the committee to cancel todays 
hearing but was told he would have to appear and assert his rights 
in person 
in a letter to the subcommittee pierces attorneys said the 
circumstances surrounding the hearings had not changed from last 
month when he first refused to answer questions 
mr pierce is concerned that there continues to be an 
atmosphere wherein he remains a target of the subcommittees 
hearings the attorneys said it is our hope that sometime in 
the near future the present level of tension may be reduced such 
that mr pierce ca reconsider his present position and testify 
under fair and mutually agreeable circumstances

the white house said today the us embassy in 
el salvador is looking into charges by a salvadoran soldier that he 
was part of a death squad responsible for as many as 72 murders 
ordered by top military leaders and condoned by american advisers 
cesar vielman joya martinez who was meeting today with members 
of congress says he took part in eight of the killings under 
orders to bring leftist guerrillas to justice 
my work was only to execute these people said joya 
martinez 28 who fled el salvador in july seeking asylum 
the pentagon responding to joya martinez allegations thursday 
called claims of us complicity in death squad activity patently 
absurd 
we know of no instances in which us military personne have 
been even remotely associated with such morally repugnant 
activities the statement said 
cia spokesman mark mansfield said we have no comment on it 
as a matter of policy we dont comment on intelligence matters 
joya martinez said that from april into july he was a member of 
a sevenman special forces group of the 1st infantry brigade called 
gc2 in the capital of san salvador he said two us advisers 
known to the salvadoran troops only as the major and 
william purchased supplies for the group and had to know 
what was going on 
joya martinez outlined his allegations for us reporters 
thursday in interviews at a washington hotel and planned a series 
of private visits with members of congress today 
the salvadoran military denies the defectors death squad 
claims but jeff brown an information at the us embassy in el 
salvador said ambassador william walker considers the charges 
very serious and if they are truthful they must be 
investigated 
white house spokesman marlin fitzwater asked about the 
accusations today while flying with bush to costa rica said 
were concerned about it ambassador walker is looking into it 
he does not expect it would come up in the presidents talks with 
other hemispheric leaders in costa rica 
joya martinez speaking in spanish said his orders came in 
onepage reports issued by the salvadoran joint chiefs of staff he 
said the reports went to the commanders of the brigade cols juan 
orlando zepeda and franciso elena fuentes 
he said he took part in eight killings but the reports he saw 
indicated 72 people were killed from april to july 
the report did not say kill them it said bring them to 
justice which in simple terms means to kill them joya martinez 
said my job was to kill or be killed 
he said the two american advisers were not in military uniform 
they were assigned to the unit to analyze intelligence data and pay 
for supplies ranging from weapons to gasoline he said 
they had control of the department joya martinez said he 
said he did not know exactly what knowledge the americans had but 
said obviously they had to know what was going on 
there are 55 us military advisers and an unknown number of cia 
agents in el salvador 
joya martinez said he made the allegations public in an attempt 
to stop the killings col elena fuentes said in el salvador two 
weeks ago that joya martinez is a defector wanted for the murder of 
two civilians 
the former soldier is seeking asylum in the united states the 
us immigration service has accused him of entry without 
inspection and he could be deported said his attorney william 
van wyke 
van wyke said the asylum request is based on fear of 
persecution if joya martinez were forced to return to el salvador 
joya martinez said he never knew the identities of his victims 
and that a lieutenant in the unit made sure the faces were 
covered 
sometimes they were almost dead from being beaten during 
interrogation he said 
the soldiers usually slit the throats of the victims and hurled 
the bodies over a cliff into the pacific ocean he said 
they the officers always said we had to do this to end the 
war because they were terrorists joya martinez said 
asked how he felt about his part in the killings he said i 
feel stupid thats the word i realize i was manipulated i knew 
it was me or them 
joya martinez said he left the country after colleagues in his 
own unit were given orders to kill him because of a botched 
military sweep to pick up suspected guerillas 
human rights and church groups have claimed for years that death 
squads run by el salvadors extreme rightwing political faction 
have killed tens of thousands of civilians since 1979 the start of 
an ongoing war between marxistled guerrillas and the usbacked 
troops 
the united states puts about 15 million a day in economic and 
military aid into el salvador 
elena fuentes said two weeks ago theres no such thing as a 
death squad we dont harbor any kind of dark organization

slimmeddown lead over rudolph w giuliani in three new opinion 
polls indicating the damage inflicted in a difficult week for the 
democratic frontrunner 
dinkins maintained a doubledigit lead in two of the surveys 
although the third put the race tighter with a 5point dinkins 
edge the closer poll pushed undecided voters to make a choice and 
did not reject unlikely voters 
dinkins also held doubledigit leads in two polls conducted 
earlier and released this week additionally a oneday daily 
newswabctv poll sunday put the race at its closest dinkins ahead 
by 4541 percent 
oneday polls are sensitive to recent events such as dinkins 
struggle last week to answer questions about his personal and 
campaign finances other differences in method can account for 
differences in poll results 
dinkins was ahead 4935 percent in one of the new polls 
conducted among 658 likely voters monday and tuesday by the marist 
institute for public opinion a poll saturday and sunday for the 
teamsters union which backs dinkins gave him a 4934 percent lead 
among 600 likely voters 
a new york postwnbc poll conducted sunday through tuesday put 
the race at 4742 percent it had fewer undecided voters 
indicating that those who were uncertain tended to pick giuliani 
when pressed for a choice 
that poll questioned 600 registered voters while the marist and 
teamster polls were conducted among the subset of voters who 
appeared most likely to turn out 
youre dealing with a somewhat closer more competitive race 
but one that still finds dinkins with a good lead with less than 
two weeks to go said lee miringoff head of the marist institute 
in poughkeepsie 
he came through what clearly was a low point last week and 
seems to have been able to absorb the fallout miringoff said 
dinkins maintains at worst case an edge and at best case a fairly 
sizable lead 
dinkins who would be the citys first black mayor commanded 95 
percent support from blacks who made up nearly a quarter of the 
respondents in the marist survey whites overall favored giuliani 
5126 percent but 21 percent were undecided 
in the postwnbc poll dinkins had the support of 91 percent of 
black voters a lower figure than in the marist poll and 60 
percent of the whites a considerably higher figure than in the 
marist poll

folks who have been a bit tired all summer 
will finally get back that lost hour of sleep this weekend with 
the return of standard time 
the time change occurs officially at 2 am local time sunday 
the moment when clocks should be set back an hour 
that switch provides the extra hour for sleep carousing toil 
or whatever that was lost last spring when the clocks were moved 
ahead 
the international association of fire chiefs is trying to get 
americans to use a bit of the extra time for the potentially 
lifesaving act of replacing batteries in smoke detectors in their 
homes 
the change to standard time moves an hour of daylight from the 
evening to the morning 
that means it will get dark earlier at night but there will be 
more light in the mornings 
the earlier darkness is also a safety consideration for parents 
whose children will be going out on halloween night and for anyone 
driving in the dim light 
the change affects most americans although a few areas do not 
change to daylight time in the spring and thus dont have to go 
back in the fall these include include arizona hawaii parts of 
indiana puerto rico the virgin islands and american samoa 
the date of the change is set by congress and while its become 
a tradition for most of the nation the notion of standard time is 
only just over a century old 
before that every local city and town had its own time setting 
the town clock according to the sun and expecting residents to 
coordinate their watches and clocks with that standard 
the result was thousands of different times across the nation a 
situation that bothered few people until railroad transportation 
became common and the timetables became impossible to coordinate 
because of the different clocks 
the result was that the railroads appealed to congress standard 
time and the time zones were set up and the confusion was limited 
to twice a year when the switch is made between standard and 
daylight time 
and that didnt begun until world watr i in an effort to save 
energy by moving some light to the evening and thus saving on 
lighting in homes and factories

after 13 years of predawn today wakeups 
cohost jane pauley confirmed to a national audience this morning 
that shes leaving the nbc show at years end she hugged her 
successor deborah norville and gave her an alarm clock 
pauleys farewell announcement in which she said shell most 
miss working with cohost bryant gumbel was preceded by his 
comments in which he criticized idle and often erroneous 
speculation about the troubled toprated show 
gumbel said the speculation had been much to the detriment of 
all of us here 
pauley had been reported to be unhappy at recent changes on the 
show including the sept 5 arrival of norville as its news anchor 
succeeding john palmer 
referring to pauley as my buddy and that it goes without 
saying that im going to miss her gumbel said that shes leaving 
the show sometime at the end of this year or january of next 
year 
pauley who turns 39 on tuesday has two years remaining on an 
nbc contract reportedly paying her 12 million annually she is 
going to coanchor a primetime news series next year she said in 
an interview after the show 
in the interview she confirmed what she had alluded to in the 
show that she had in fact had asked to leave it 
she said there were a number of changes that had been made that 
had worried her and norvilles arrival and palmers departure to 
the earlier nbc news at sunrise was only one of them she said 
she also thought that nbc executives wanted her to leave 
she said she had had tough talks with nbc news president 
michael gartner and nbc sports president dick ebersol who wears a 
second hat overseeing today 
initially she said we didnt believe each other they did 
not believe that i simply wanted to leave the today show and i 
did not believe that they were committed to my future here at nbc 
but eventually she said each side reached an understanding and 
a deal was worked out for her to leave today at the end of the 
year and coanchor a new asyet untitled prime time news series 
that will premiere next june the other coanchor hasnt been 
chosen she said 
during the show she said that persuading nbc that it was time 
for a change of staff on today was the hardest thing i have 
ever done it has taken two long months 
she took pains to play down reports she was at odds with either 
gumbel or norville saying it has hurt to see two of my friends 
bryant and deborah assigned roles in this that they did not play 
pauley joined today in 1976 when she left nbcowned wmaqtv 
in chicago to succeed barbara walters 
pauley noted that when she joined the show her prececessor the 
first fulltime female anchor on the 36yearold program sent her 
a telegram wishing her good luck and a good alarm clock then 
pauley smiled gave norville an alarm clock and the two hugged 
norville praised pauley saying youre a tough act to repeat 
and i wont even try 
before the show went to a commercial she gumbel and norville 
held hands in a nationally televised show of solidarity 
no decision has been made on who will succeed norville 31 as 
anchor of the twohour programs news segments the former anchor 
of the earlier nbc news at sunrise she swapped jobs last month 
with palmer 
although today consistently has led in morningshow ratings 
over its closest competitor abcs good morning america 
turmoil on nbcs program began early this year with the leak of a 
scathing memo from gumbel 
the memo while not mentioning pauley criticized several staff 
members on the show particularly weatherman willard scott 
scott has eased off the pointed jokes he made to and about 
gumbel after the memos disclosure and he denied on wednesday 
speculation that hell leave today shortly after pauley does 
he joined the show in 1980 
gumbel became a today cohost in january 1982 norville 
joined nbc news and its nbc news at sunrise five years later 
from the networks chicago station 
this summer she signed a fiveyear contract reportedly worth 1 
million a year

secretary of state james a baker iii quashed 
a speech by a senior us expert on the soviet union that contained 
a pessimistic assessment of mikhail gorbachevs chances of success 
in revamping the soviet economy the white house confirmed today 
on a flight to costa rica presidential spokesman marlin 
fitzwater acknowledged there were various opinions within the bush 
administration about gorbachevs prospects 
fitzwater confirmed a new york times report that robert m 
gates the deputy national security adviser had been muzzled 
while there were assessments all over the lot about the 
future of gorbachevs attempts to restructure the soviet economy 
the point is we want it to endure the spokesman said 
thats the presidents policy fitzwater told reporters 
aboard air force one as bush headed to san jose for a celebration 
of costa ricas 100 years as a democracy 
its not really a question of policy fitzwater added 
its a question of analysis and interpretation of events that the 
state department felt was better left unsaid at this point 
the state department just felt its inappropriate to talk 
about it at this time he said 
baker frequently has said the united states wishes gorbachev 
well in his restructuring policy but except for offering some 
undefined technical advice the secretary of state has stressed it 
is up to the soviets to determine their future 
gates a former deputy director of the cia had been scheduled 
to speak to the national collegiate security conference in 
bethesda md a student colloquium 
other members of the administration including vice president 
dan quayle defense secretary dick cheney and deputy secretary of 
state lawrence eagleburger all in one form or another have 
registered public skepticism about gorbachevs prospects 
baker whose top aides initially described gorbachev as 
essentially deft at public relations and adapting us ideas on 
arms control has gradually warmed to the soviet leaders uphill 
campaign to change the soviet system 
gates in a speech last year said gorbachev had not really 
changed the soviet pattern russian and soviet history caution 
us to be skeptical and cautious the thencia official said 
the speech disturbed thensecretary of state george p shultz 
who reportedly complained to gates after it was delivered

its strange how things happen sometimes in 
october 1974 two months after the watergate scandal forced 
president richard nixon to resign from office the oakland as won 
the world series 
now if the as dont win it again saturday and have to play a 
fifth game sunday night abc will have to postpone until dec 17 
its scheduled sunday tv movie one that dramatizes nixons last 
weeks in office 
rgeardless of what happens and whenever abcs threehour the 
final days airs youll find it a flawed but fascinating program 
with an emmycaliber performance by lane smith as a tormented 
anguished nixon 
it is based on the 1976 book by carl bernstein and robert 
woodward who chronicled their watergate exposures in all the 
presidents men the movie of that book starred robert redford 
and dustin hoffman as the probing reporters 
in days nixons lawyers complained to abc last march about 
what they said were inaccuracies in the book no star reporters 
dash about from source to source in dogged search of the story 
here the drama basically is told through the eyes of nixons 
watergatedefense attorney j fred buzhardt effectively played by 
richard kiley as a quiet honest man doggedly seeking the truth 
despite what days depicts as nixons obstructions and 
distortions 
nixon resigned after oncesecret tapes of white house 
conversations revealed he knew of a coverup of political sabotage 
by his reelection team against his democratic opponents in the 
1972 presidential campaign 
the tortured behindthescenes events leading up to that after 
the famous 1972 breakin at democratic national committee offices 
at the watergate hotel are retold in days but in perhaps too 
much detail 
bit by bit it all returns the famed 18minute gap discovered 
by buzhardt in a key tape the spectre of john dean the saturday 
night massacre after attorney general elliot richardson resigned 
rather than obey nixons order to fire watergate special prosecutor 
archibald cox the smoking pistol tape that sealed nixons fate 
all this at times makes you wish scriptwriter hugh whitemore had 
cut to the chase more briskly instead of painstakingly adding 
layer upon layer upon layer in this dostoyevskian video visit to 
the big house on pennsylvania avenue 
the script appears augmented by excerpts from various memoirs 
those of nixons daughter julie his secretary of state henry 
kissinger and nixon himself with the actors playing them speaking 
their thoughts in narration 
while this fleshes out the basics of the book on which the show 
is based it tends to distract slightly from the main event how 
disclosure of the white house tape recording system doomed nixons 
presidency 
another flaw its version of nixons chief of staff alexander 
haig jr david ogden stiers is simplistic painting haig as a 
loyal unquestioning subordinate no matter how dubious the 
presidential demand 
there is no hint of the books claim that haig in conversations 
with kissinger and his aides sometimes referred to the president 
as an inherently weak man who lacked guts 
to whitemores credit the dialogue is remarkably free of the 
wooden pompous tone that afflicts most dramatizations of 
washington history the words sound natural even if their accuracy 
can and probably will be debated 
blessed with intelligent restrained direction by richard 
pearce the film recreates the books account of nixon during his 
last white house night insisting that kissinger kneel down and 
pray with him then collapsing on the floor weeping 
but it minimizes the books report of nixon sometimes drinking 
heavily showing him drinking but never intoxicated and it doesnt 
use the books claim that nixon once reportedly was seen talking to 
portraits on the white house walls which he has strongly denied 
through his friends and lawyers 
the final days is unusually wellacted save for an odd 
almost comical kissinger played with deep teutonic somberness by 
theodore bikel 
the nixon of the relatively littleknown lane smith is a 
masterpiece even though he initially seems a little too 
softspoken and not forceful enough 
but gradually expertly recreating nixons awkward hunchbacked 
walk and gestures smith becomes eminently convincing as the 
driven agonized man who became the only american president to ever 
resign from office

president bush vetoed the district of 
columbias 34 annual spending package today because it permitted 
use of city tax dollars for medicaidfunded abortions 
bushs veto which had been widely expected was announced by 
the white house when the president arrived in costa rica for a 
twoday visit 
the veto came two days after the house sustained bushs veto of 
a labor health and education spending bill that also permitted use 
of medicaid funds for abortions for poor women made pregnant 
through rape or incest 
the veto came despite protests from city officials that the 
districts antidrug efforts would be imperiled unless the spending 
package was approved 
included in the bill was 32 million in extra federal money to 
pay for the hiring of 700 extra police officers extra judges and a 
variety of schoolbased drug education and prevention programs 
congress approved the anticrime package to help the capital 
battle its record homicide rate and drugrelated crime wave the 
bill also included a payment of 435 million to make up for local 
tax revenue lost on federally owned property 
abortionrights advocates and local government officials also 
complained that if bush vetoed the bill he would be exerting 
unfair influence over the citys legislative affairs 
the abortion debate began in july when the house voted to allow 
the district to use its own tax money to pay for medicaidfunded 
abortions at the time lawmakers said the city was given the right 
because of last summers supreme court ruling that granted states 
great latitude in regulating abortions 
the city traditionally has funded abortions for lowincome women 
in last years budget antiabortion forces in congress 
succeeded in barring the city from using its own taxes for any type 
of abortion 
city officials said earlier this week that they do not expect 
congress to muster the twothirds vote necessary to override bushs 
veto in both the house and senate

police stormed an overcrowded state prison 
this morning to regain control from inmates who seized hostages and 
set fires in a twonight riot that left more than 100 people 
injured authorities said 
officers fired shots and tear gas in a kitchen building 
wounding one inmate in the assault that led to retaking of control 
less than two hours later at 935 am said ken robinson state 
corrections department spokesman 
hospital officials said that at some point a guard and two 
prisoners were critically injured 
police in riot gear and wielding shotguns pushed surrendering or 
captured prisoners to the ground holding them facedown in the 
grass 
rioters among about 1900 inmates who remained loose in their 
cellblocks this morning were taken to a holding area at the rear of 
the prison grounds robinson said 
there was continuing confusion about the numbers of rioters 
injuries and hostages in the rampages that started wednesday night 
officials initially said there were eight hostages later it was 
reported there were four and that all were released safely 
throughout the night and this morning but a fifth hostage was 
found after order was restored officials said 
more than 100 people were injured including 60 thursday night 
and this morning robinson said he said there were no deaths and 
all employees are accounted for 
a 24yearold inmate was hospitalized in critical condition 
suffering from a gunshot wound to the abdomen said deborah saline 
spokeswoman at milton s hershey medical center a guard 41 was 
in critical condition with multiple stab wounds to the back she 
said 
an 18yearold prisoner was in critical condition from a gunshot 
wound at polyclinic hospital said spokesman jim mulay 
one of the hostages a prison guard was released thursday night 
as a good faith gesture and state police freed a second 
hostage from a cellblock this morning robinson said 
they literally pulled him out of there robinson said 
at one point all inmates were out of all the cellblocks 
said robinson though not all inmates were actively involved in the 
rioting 
about 500 state troopers with local police and firefighters 
moved in early today to retake the 2600inmate mediumsecurity 
prison 
the officers entered through gates in prison walls at first 
occupying areas that werent held by the prisoners and avoiding 
clashes with hostageholding inmates 
at the time robinson said prisoners were negotiating with 
authorities he said their demands shifted through the night 
at one point the hostage holders demanded to talk to gov robert 
p casey and officials of the human rights group amnesty 
international said a state police negotiator cpl raul ramos 
casey did not comply 
earlier a huge fire in the education building sent flames 
rising 100 feet in the air and an explosion at or near a prison 
furniture factory rattled windows up to a mile away 
inmates pelted firefighters with rocks 
officials said 12 of 31 prison buildings were destroyed in the 
fires including two commissaries officials had to bring in a 
portable national guard kitchen to provide meals for prisoners not 
involved in the rampage prison officials also said eight temporary 
housing units used to ease overcrowding were destroyed and three of 
the 10 cellblocks were damaged by the blazes 
its total chaos they lost control said a guard who was in 
one of the cellblocks when thursdays disturbance began as meals 
were being served at 7 pm the officers were told to lock the 
doors and leave we had to get out they said they were going 
to kill us 
last night was a riot tonight was war said the guard a 
sixyear staffer who refused to give his name 
the prison had been locked down early thursday after violence 
wednesday night that caused severe damage to six cellblocks 
prison officials had difficulty explaining how the prisoners had 
managed to free themselves and erupt in new violence 
there was a bunch of little fires at first but they started 
putting mattresses on the windows said steve tobias a resident 
of nearby lemoyne who was passing the prison as the new outbreak 
begana whole bunch of inmates were running toward the fence 
but when they heard the shots they went back the other way 
officials said lock mechanisms on some cells may have been 
damaged in wednesdays riots and a guard at one cellblock said the 
inmates may have stolen some keys during the melee 
prison spokesman john palakovich said most of those injured were 
firefighters but he wouldnt characterize their injuries 
inmates had gotten into prison tools such as screwdrivers 
hammers and saws palakovich said he had no reports of prisoners 
with guns 
palakovich said state police fired warning shots in the prison 
in the early stages of the disturbance a television view at one 
point showed a police officer on top of a firetruck firing a gun 
into the air 
on wednesday 47 people were injured during a sevenhour siege 
that prison officials estimated involved 1200 inmates palakovich 
said even more inmates were involved in thursdays melee 
prison superintendent robert freeman said wednesdays riot may 
have been caused by overcrowding and inmates resentment over 
policy changes 
inmates were upset by a decision not to allow families to bring 
in food during extended familyday visits officials said the food 
could be used to conceal drugs cash and other contraband 
a new medical policy that prisoners objected to actually 
improves access to care but inmates viewed the change as an 
attempt to restrict health care freeman said adding that the 
staff could have done a better job explaining the changes the 
change involved assigning routine examinations to certain days 
camp hill is about 45 percent over capacity and the entire state 
prison system is about 48 percent over capacity 
attorney general ernie preate jr said the disturbance at camp 
hill 4 miles west of harrisburg and a smaller uprising at 
huntingdon state prison on monday were the predictable result of 
a prison crowding crisis that has been allowed to fester for too 
long

terry anderson spent a fifth birthday as 
a hostage today a grim milestone in his captivity 
his relatives and friends marked the event with a flood of 
messages and with a mass in washington radio reports said 
lebanons three television stations would screen a birthday message 
from his 4yearold daughter sulome 
the daily newspapers annahar and assafir and the 
frenchlanguage lorientle jour published english texts of letters 
to anderson the chief middle east correspondent of the associated 
press who was abducted march 16 1985 
his sister peggy say wrote in honor of your birthday on 
friday we will be in washington with other hostage families to 
mark another sad year in which you have been denied your freedom 
the journalists committee to free terry anderson made up of 
colleagues from all over the united states wrote please believe 
that not a day passes when we do not think of you and pray for 
you 
the foreign correspondents club of japan said it was sending a 
33foot birthday scroll to anderson signed by 59 journalists and 
former colleagues in tokyo 
anderson was a member of the club during a working assignment in 
japan 19791981 
prominent journalists along with representatives of the state 
department and the embassies of lebanon algeria and syria 
attended a mass in georgetown universitys dahlgren chapel where 
mrs say said such ceremonies ensure her brother will not be 
forgotten 
gunmen seized the 42yearold anderson in moslem west beirut 
after a game of tennis that had been a brief respite from his 
reporting on lebanons civil war 
he has not held sulome born three months after the morning he 
was kidnapped he probably does not know that his father and 
brother died of cancer 
andersons fate now appears to be caught up in a power struggle 
between shiite moslem radicals and moderates 
he was kidnapped by islamic jihad a group loyal to iran whose 
name means islamic holy war his abductors demand the release of 15 
men imprisoned in kuwait for bombing the us and french embassies 
in 1983 
islamic jihad also holds thomas sutherland 57 an american who 
was acting dean of agriculture at american university of beirut 
sutherland was kidnapped june 9 1985 
police say lebanese authorities have no information on the 
whereabouts of anderson or the 15 other western hostages in lebanon 
four days ago islamic jihad made its first statement in a year 
reviving an old offer to trade anderson and sutherland for their 
comrades jailed in kuwait 
a copy of the statement delivered to a western news agency in 
beirut was accompanied by a photograph of anderson similar to one 
released nov 4 1988 after his last birthday 
the statement was seen as a response to a declaration monday by 
president hashemi rafsanjani of iran that he would use its 
influence to free the hostages if the united states released 
iranian assets worth up to 12 billion that have been frozen since 
1979 
kuwait has refused to free the prsoners but two members of the 
group were released in february after completing fiveyear 
sentences the united states has said it will not negotiate with 
terrorists 
anderson and sutherland are among eight american hostages most 
believed held by proiranians 
islamic jihad issued its statement as the leader of irans 
revolutionary radicals former interior minister ali akbar 
mohtashemi was on a threeweek visit to lebanon he met with 
prominent shiites including leading figures in hezbollah believed 
to be the umbrella group for kidnap gangs 
it was not clear why mohtashemi rafsanjanis main political 
rival came to lebanon but the trip underlined his power struggle 
with rafsanjani leader of the comparatively moderate 
pragmatists who want to restore relations with the west 
a knowledgeable shiite said privately the islamic jihad 
statement was a clear indication that the hostageholders are not 
under rafsanjanis control 
hezbollah appears to have split into factions with the main 
groups supporting either rafsanjani or mohtashemi 
rafsanjani dismissed mohtashemi after his election as president 
july 28 the former interior ministers surprise appearance in 
lebanon quashed reports from tehran that he was under house arrest 
mohtashemi returned to tehran on wednesday via damascus syria 
since he was kidnapped anderson has been allowed to write a few 
letters to his family and occasionally to see lebanese newspaper 
and television reports about relatives 
american and french hostages who shared his captivity and were 
released have told of his courage and fears how he has defied his 
captors and suffered the agonies of captivity 
his father glenn and elder brother glenn jr died of cancer 
in 1986 released hostages said he did not know of the deaths 
anderson knows his daughter sulome was born june 7 1985 but 
has seen her only in a few seconds of film his captors allowed him 
to watch on lebanese tv according to letters from him released by 
the kidnappers

proponents said raising the fha mortgage ceiling will help tens 
of thousands of young families cope with higher real estate prices 
opponents however contended the higher ceiling will only 
deepen the exposure of the fha to losses that will have to be made 
up by taxpayers if a large number of the loans turn sour the fha 
lost 42 billion last year in loan defaults 
the bill provides 124 billion for the national aeronautics and 
space administration including 18 billion for the planned space 
station in fiscal 1990 which began oct 1 
it also makes available 56 billion for the environmental 
protection agency 114 billion for veterans medical care and 
151 billion for housing programs

a british tourist whose charred bones were 
found in a game park was murdered a court ruled friday 
vindicating her fathers yearlong battle against state 
investigators who claimed wild animals had killed her 
the death of julie ward remains unsolved however with no one 
arrested and the judge saying he saw no need for further 
investigation ms wards father has charged there was an official 
coverup to protect kenyas lucrative tourism industry 
ms wards partly charred lower left leg and lower jaw were 
found on sept 13 1988 in the sprawling masai mara game reserve 
a week after she reportedly left the worldrenowned park while on a 
wildlife photography expedition 
the state claimed the 28yearold woman was eaten by carnivores 
after abandoning her vehicle mired in mud the masai mara is home 
to lions vultures hyenas and leopards among other meat eaters 
her father john ward a hotelier from suffolk england 
contended she was murdered hacked up and burned with gasoline he 
pleaded with the state to order an inquest and spent tens of 
thousands of dollars and hundreds of hours in a private 
investigation of her death 
there is ample and substantial evidence that julie ward died 
of foul play by a person or persons unknown chief magistrate 
joseph mango said at the conclusion of his inquiry which began in 
midaugust and heard 38 witnesses before ending oct 6 
in rejecting the states contention that ms ward had been 
killed by animals mango said i think the animals are innocent 
if they are guilty at all it is in eating what they found 
however he said he saw no reason to investigate her death 
further and rejected claims by her family that the state had 
engaged in a coverup to protect her killer or kenyas 360 million 
annual tourist trade 
there has been a strong attack on the quality of the 
investigations and allegations of a coverup mango said 
of course the state does not admit this 
he further denied that simon makallah the masai maras chief 
game warden is or was a principal suspect in ms wards murder 
during the inquest wards attorney byron georgiadis had tried 
to build a case that ms ward was killed by someone who knew the 
game park well had freedom of movement there and could have 
ordered or inspired a coverup of the circumstances surrounding her 
disappeareance 
he pointed to makallah as a chief suspect contending the game 
warden was able to find the young womans remains hours after her 
vehicle was located six miles away only because he already knew 
where they were 
mango however said there had been no evidence to suggest 
makallah and ms ward ever met before her death and the fact that 
he found her remains does not cast suspicion on makallah 
instead he said investigators should have considered as prime 
suspects two men ms ward spent time with in the game park neither 
of whom appeared as witnesses at the inquest 
after the ruling ward said he was surprised at the outcome and 
that he had had very serious doubts mango would rule in his 
favor he called the ruling a credit to kenya 
at the end of the day he came up with the verdict that was 
required ward said 
but asked if he was pleased with the ruling he said how can 
you be pleased to have it confirmed that your daughter has been 
murdered but yes i suppose i am pleased 
ward repeated his belief there had been a coverup and referred 
to a british pathologists report accepted by mango as accurate 
that proved his daughter had been hacked to pieces by a sharp 
instrument and not torn apart by animals 
a state pathologists report said her remains had been cleanly 
cut but was later altered by a superior to say they had been 
cracked and torn injuries more indicative of an animals mauling 
the british report was presented to kenyas police commissioner 
months ago and he chose to ignore it ward said 
police have admitted several blunders in the case including 
failing to interview people in the area in addition a park gate 
keeper admitted forging ms wards signature on a visitors book to 
show she had left the preserve 
im not retracting anything about a coverup ward said he 
added that he hoped police would work to solve the murder despite 
mangos belief that the case did not require further investigation 
this is a solvable crime he said hopefully the police 
will do this now

the senate today approved an 85 billion 
military construction bill that slashes president bushs request 
for bases overseas but adds millions of dollars for domestic 
projets 
by voice vote the senate adopted the legislation and sent it to 
the president for his signature 
the bill cuts military construction spending in fiscal 1990 by 
461 million from what was spent during the fiscal year that ended 
sept 30 and is 65 million below what bush wanted to spend this 
year 
i think weve seen the peak of military construction spending 
for many years to come said sen james sasser dtenn chairman 
of the senate appropriations subcommittee on military construction 
next year may be even smaller than the bill here today 
the bill eliminates 408 million bush proposed for dormitories 
storage facilities and other construction in the philippines 15 
million for airfield improvements in honduras and 144 million for 
an aircraft parking extension and other improvements at us bases 
in panama 
it also reduces bushs request for britain from 108 milllion to 
20 million and the presidents budget for nato infrastructure from 
501 million to 424 million 
funding for overseas will continue to be a low priority until 
our allies substantially improve their contribution to their 
defense sasser said 
late thursday the house approved the legislation by voice vote 
the bill was the product of house and senate negotiators working on 
separately passed bills 
in the house the only controversy focused on an effort by reps 
glenn anderson dcalif and dana rohrabacher rcalif to stop a 
land swap deal between the navy and the state of hawaii to relocate 
the home port of the battleship uss missouri from long beach to 
pearl harbor 
this is going to eat up millions and millions of dollars that 
could be used by the navy and for military housing to duplicate a 
facility that already exists rohrabacher said 
but the house accepted the land swap on an overwhelming voice 
vote after opponents called the effort to stop it a sneak 
attack on a military base closing and relocation initiative 
approved earlier 
this is an attempt to stop the base closure bill no doubt 
about it said rep bill hefner dnc chairman of the house 
appropriations subcommittee on military construction 
the bill calls for the navy to sell 120 acres on oahu to the 
state which will build a causeway leading to ford island the 
island now is accessible only by ferry 
the overall legislation includes 48 billion for military 
construction 32 billion for family housing and 500 million to 
begin closing 86 us bases and scaling back five others 
it provides 105 million the administration requested for a 
railgarrison basing system for the mx multiplewarhead nuclear 
missile at warren air force base in wyoming 
also included is 11 million for the military construction 
aspect of star wars and 94 million for construction of bases for 
the b2 stealth bomber the total for basing the b2 bomber is 35 
million less than the administration requested 
the legislation increases spending on military facilities in 
tennessee and north carolina home states of the chairmen of the 
senate and house appropriations subcommittees on military 
construction 
the administration requested 873 million for the memphis naval 
air station army national guard armories and other facilities in 
tennessee house and senate conferees put in 1092 million for 
sassers home state 
in north carolina the administration proposed 108 million for 
fort bragg camp lejeune marine corps base and other installations 
but hefners home state is slated to receive 1338 million 
significant increases also were made in the military 
construction budgets of california and iowa the home states of the 
subcommittees ranking republicans rep bill lowery of california 
and sen charles grassley of iowa 
west virginia home state of democratic sen robert byrd 
chairman of the full senate appropriations committee will get 
215 million while the administration sought 45 million 
mississippi home state of rep jamie whitten the democratic 
chairman of the house appropriations committee gets 497 million 
while bush requested only 20 million

the audience at a tourist attraction that 
recreates the 1906 earthquake and fire complete with shaking and 
smoke sat through last weeks 71 temblor thinking it was just 
part of the act the shows manager said 
employees of the san francisco experience where the motto 
is feel the earth shake had to persuade people to leave on 
oct 17 manager craig patterson said 
i was scared when things outside the theater started to fall 
and i didnt know what id find when i went into the show said 
cashier shirley hobsonjackson the first worker to alert the 
audience of 26 people 
what she found was people just sitting there quietly in the 
dark 
power was out but the theater had already been darkened for the 
show 
i told them we just had an earthquake and some said they 
thought it was part of the show she said 
the last thing the show needed was competition from the real 
thing patterson said thursday while only three people watched the 
show in the 220seat theater near fishermans wharf 
on the day before the earthquake 420 people saw the san 
francisco experience he said since it reopened oct 19 the 
28minute show has drawn an average of 80 a day 
patterson doesnt blame the shows realism with shaking caused 
by blasting bass speakers for scaring off customers he cites a 
lack of tourists and the closures of the bay bridge and the freeway 
near the waterfront 
the 1906 quake in which more than 700 people died hasnt 
always been the big draw of the san francisco experience 
brainchild of the late bing crosby that opened in 1971 
the seven screens and 32 speakers at the attraction also feature 
the gold rush chinatown cable cars the golden gate and alcatraz 
feel the earth shake was added at the suggestion of 
consultants patterson said 
patterson is convinced theres still plenty of drawing power 
left in earthquake simulation so much so he said that hes going 
to add footage about the quake of 1989

china one of the major supporters of 
the afghan rebels has cut its arms supplies to the group and is 
slowly normalizing relations with the sovietbacked government 
asian diplomats said 
a kabulbased chinese diplomat said beijing has begun trade ties 
with the afghan government and generally supported president 
najibs attempts to unite the country torn by an 11yearold civil 
war 
we would like to see a broadbased coalition of forces unite 
in this country said the diplomat who spoke on condition of 
anomymity we dont care who is in power that is the internal 
affairs of afghanistan 
asian diplomats said the change in policy began this year 
following the withdrawal in february of soviet troops from 
afghanistan 
in june a chinasoviet summit in beijing the first in 30 
years quickened the pace soviet president mikhail s gorbachev 
apparently was assured that china would stop arming the moslem 
guerrillas who are fighting to establish an islamic republic in 
afghanistan 
the soviets have withdrawn from afghanistan said the 
chinese official that was our main goal we see no need to 
continue our support of the guerrillas 
diplomats said they were not sure how the end of chinas support 
would affect the guerrillas ability to fight 
china began supplying the rebel forces soon after the soviet 
union intervened in afghanistan a decade ago chinesemade ak47 
automatic weapons along with chinese mortars small rockets 
grenades and other light arms were the weapons of choice for many 
of the rebel bands diplomats said 
chinese support never reached the level of american assistance 
which hovers at an estimated 600 million a year asian diplomats 
predicted that rebel forces would continue to be supplied with 
chinese arms but that they would be purchased on the international 
arms market 
one highranking asian diplomat whose country has good 
relations with afghanistan said his embassy believed chinese arms 
supplies stopped sometime this summer 
everything in the pipeline was delivered he said but 
they made no new commitments 
he said the policy shift was in line with recent changes in 
chinas foreign policy 
now that china and the soviet union are normalizing relations 
and chinas ties are also improving with india beijing does not 
see the need to encourage a civil war in afghanistan he said 
in addition he said since the crackdown on the prodemocracy 
movement in beijing chinese foreign policy has taken on a more 
cautious air 
they are very concerned again with their relations with other 
socialist countries he said we perceive this as part of the 
chinese leaderships renewed emphasis on politics 
the chinese diplomat said trade relations have begun with 
afghanistan china is selling canned goods and some light 
industrial products he also noted the afghan government has 
stopped criticizing chinas policy toward the war 
indeed the foreign ministry no longer mentions china when it 
discusses the supporters of the guerrillas

the governor is calling out 100 
national guard troops to expand the search for an 11yearold boy 
abducted at gunpoint five days ago by a masked man officials said 
today 
gov rudy perpich decided to activate the troops after he 
visited the parents of the boy jacob wetterling on thursday 
night said guard spokeswoman maj lucy kender 
the guardsmen based in st cloud would be deployed saturday 
morning said lt col ron deppa 
stearns county sheriff charlie grafft asked for additional state 
help thursday night citing the large area the search had to cover 
jacob was abducted by a man dressed in black sunday night on a 
rural road less than a mile from his home in this central minnesota 
town of 2200 
authorities said an earlier lead that the kidnapper may have 
been driving a small red car turned out to be bogus 
an art student who owns such a car called authorities to say he 
had been driving in the area in search of good material to sketch 
and probably was spotted by several residents who thought the 
driver was suspicious 
we believe that was the vehicle we had been looking for 
said jim kostreba chief deputy sheriff of stearns county 
the fox networks a current affair aired a segment on the 
abduction thursday night and kostreba said telephones at search 
headquarters began ringing almost continuously as soon as the phone 
number was shown 
we had to hook up additional phones he said were 
getting calls from all up and down the east coast from people 
volunteering information about similar cases 
a group of anonymous twin cities business leaders thursday night 
offered a 100000 cash reward for jacobs return unharmed within 
72 hours the offer ends at 11 pm sunday st joseph community 
organizers are offering a reward of up to 25000 for information 
leading to jacobs safe return 
jacobs parents jerry and patty wetterling appeared on cbs 
this morning today to tell their story to a national tv audience 
fbi spokesman byron gigler said 20 agents have been assigned to 
the case 
jacob was riding bikes after dark with his 10yearold brother 
trevor and an 11yearold friend in this central minnesota town of 
2200 people the trip to a convenience store to rent a videotape 
was the boys first trip out by himself at night said his father 
jerry wetterling 
on the way back to the wetterlings house the boys were 
accosted by a man who had what appeared to be pantyhose pulled over 
his head to distort his facial features 
the two boys who escaped told police the man pulled a gun and 
asked them their ages then ordered them to run away and threatened 
to shoot them 
jerry wetterling said he and his wife patty a substitute 
school teacher had warned their four children to be wary of 
strangers 
my advice would be to take time to sit down and instruct 
children that there are sick people in the world said 
wetterling a chiropractor and president of the st cloud chapter 
of the national association for the advancement of colored people 
the couple described jacob as an allaround student who loved to 
study math and play goalie on a youthleague hockey team 
wetterling said they had received no ransom demands and doubted 
his civil rights activism was a factor in his sons abduction 
its an abnormal situation he said 
in washington dc sen dave durenberger rminn told senate 
colleagues of the abduction and st joseph 
its a little town guided principally by family values where 
people work together go to church together and care deeply for 
each other said durenberger a native of nearby st cloud 
it is a town that symbolizes the best virtues of americas 
small towns crime as weve come to know it here in washington 
dc is nonexistent

gerald alan yoho knew a name change was 
in order when he wanted to open up his own retail jewelry business 
you cannot have yoho jewelers the crown point businessman 
said recently discussing the change three years ago youve got a 
lady sitting at home and her husband looks her in the eye and 
says let me get this straight you left your 3000 diamond ring 
at yoho jewelers 
yohos trip to lake circuit court allowed him to flipflop his 
middle name and surname legally becoming jer yoho alan and opening 
alan jewelers on main street shortly after 
alan was one of 110 people who petitioned for a name change in 
lake and porter counties in 1986 some like alan simply sought a 
less awkward moniker 
some had something a little more poetic in mind wayne p 
thornburg for example went to court in crown point recently to 
become nicolo vincenzo antonio lore 
the law is that anybody can be known by any name they want to 
be said porter circuit judge raymond kickbush so you can come 
in and say you want to be known as bugs bunny and i can say 
fine im gonna grant that 
i recall one case where i had a person come in with a common 
first name a middle initial and a very long and involved last 
name i said well what do you want the person wanted the 
initial changed kickbush said 
the former mr yoho says it was no big hassle 
the judge called me into his chambers he just wanted to make 
sure that i wasnt doing it for some devious reason alan said 
in fact i did a couple of appraisals on his jewelry while we 
were standing there so he could find out whether or not i really 
was a jeweler

the senior republican on the house armed 
services committee has been asked by the house ethics committee to 
explain his dealings with a defense contractor who gave him a 
onethird interest in a 300000 investment 
rep bill dickinson rala received a letter from the 
committee this week asking for an explanation of his investment 
deal with ben collier a montgomery businessman whose companies did 
50 million in government defense work in the last two years 
hes very happy to explain it clay swanzy dickinsons 
administrative assistant said friday he welcomes the 
opportunity 
in an interview earlier this month dickinson acknowledged that 
he approached collier in 1986 with what i thought was a good 
business opportunity he said collier agreed to put 300000 into 
a joint venture with onethird of the profits or losses going to 
dickinson 
the congressman said he provided the contacts for the 
venture which became known as the montgomery investment club he 
insisted that there was nothing illegal immoral or unethical 
about the deal 
house rules prohibit members from accepting gifts of more than 
100 from any individual with a direct interest in legislation 
before congress dickinson contends collier is not affected by that 
rule and he said coller has never asked me to vote any way 
dickinson said he has promoted colliers businesses to major 
defense contractors just as he has helped other companies in his 
district that are interested in defense subcontracting work he has 
denied any relationship between his promotion of colliers 
businesses and the investment deal 
swanzy said the letter to dickinson from ralph l lotkin chief 
counsel for the ethics committee was fully expected and 
welcome he said dickinson is preparing a response that will 
include documents to support his contention that he has not 
violated house rules 
dickinson did not make any money from the investment venture 
the entire 300000 was invested with steven a streit of 
huntsville who was promising investors huge profits through stock 
market trading 
dickinson had invested some of his own money with streit before 
approaching collier but shortly after the 300000 was turned over 
to streit the huntsville man was arrested and charged with 
securities fraud he later pled guilty and was sentenced to 10 
years in prison 
streits assets were frozen in early 1987 and dickinson and 
collier have received about 90 percent of the 300000 from the 
bankruptcy clerk who is serving streits creditors 
dickinson has said he expects to pay onethird of the losses 
from the investment if the final settlement by the bankruptcy court 
does not recover the full 300000

president bush joined latinamerican 
leaders today for talks about drug trafficking foreign debt and 
political strife and hailed the sweep of democracy through the 
hemisphere 
even before bushs arrival from washington for a twoday 
celebration of costa ricas 100 years of democracy panamas 
military government was sniping at the united states from afar and 
nicaraguan president daniel ortega was castigating bush for 
refusing to meet with him 
bush did not mention either panama or nicaragua when he stepped 
off his plane but won applause at a welcoming ceremony when he 
declared i believe we can create here in the americas the 
worlds first completely democratic hemisphere 
ortega sat at least a halfdozen seats away from bush when the 
17 hemispheric leaders began their first working session this 
afternoon at a resort hotel outside san jose each was introduced 
to rounds of applause and their deliberations at a long table were 
broadcast live on national television 
at the airport costa rican president oscar arias announced a 
tentative agreement that will allow his country to reduce its 45 
billion foreign debt burden by 1 billion he said the agreement 
would reduce debt service by twothirds 
arias gave no further details but profusely thanked the united 
states for its help in achieving the best gift we could possibly 
make to future generations of costa ricans 
bush and arias shook hands and then embraced each other with 
hearty hugs waving at a group of youngsters in the crowd bush 
paid tribute to costa ricas tradition of greeting foreign visitors 
not with the guns of military salutes but with the cheers of 
those school children 
from the airport bush rode through heavily guarded streets to 
the cariari hotel and country club a resort complex about five 
miles outside the capital for the first of two meetings with 
hemispheric leaders lasting more than four hours this afternoon 
the heads of state sitting around a long table stretching the 
length of a room were to have lunch together between the two 
working sessions and to attend a blacktie dinner tonight at the 
downtown national theater 
bush offered other hemispheric nations a new partnership of 
mutual respect and mutual responsibility and urged them to join 
the united states to defeat the new slayers of the democratic 
dream the narco traffickers who poison our children murder 
elected officials and wage war on civil society 
arriving ahead of bush ortega told reporters he hoped the 
meeting will be the first step toward talks between north and south 
america without confronting the problems of the economy 
commerce and the rights of nations to live in peace democracy is 
at risk throughout central america ortega said 
questioned during a photo session with arias bush said he wants 
nicaragua to have free fair elections resulting in a democratic 
government asked if he would tell this to ortega the president 
replied you all are looking for some kind of fight im here to 
celebrate democracy 
security was tight as presidents and prime ministers arrived 
under cloudy skies downtown san jose was sealed off and patrolled 
by 4000 policemen and the us secret service supervised 
installation of a twoinchthick 75foot long sheet of bulletproof 
glass in front of the national museum for saturdays inauguration 
of democracy plaza 
officials said the 45ton security shield was intended 
primarily to protect bush and president virgilio barco of colombia 
who has been marked for death by drug cartel leaders for his recent 
crackdown 
nicaraguas marxist leader said he wasnt surprised that bush 
refused to meet with him thats been bushs policy ortega 
said hes always trying to trample on nicaragua 
but he added well all be sitting down together there well 
talk 
panamanian leader gen manuel antonio noriega wasnt invited to 
the summit but in advertisements placed in san joses major 
newspapers provisional panamanian president francisco ramirez told 
the leaders that democracy in panama couldnt be considered without 
also discussing us economic and political pressure 
guillermo endara panamas opposition leader who is here as an 
observer shrugged off a report that noriegas government was 
filing legal charges against him endara said he would like to see 
noriega wearing wooden pajamas a coffin by the end of the 
year 
bush regards ortegas communistbacked sandinista government as 
a threat to us national security nevertheless arias said 
earlier there will be a dialogue among all of us around a 
table with a common agenda even though bush refuses to talk 
directly to ortega 
before he left andrews air force base md aboard air force 
one bush made no direct mention of ortega instead he said he was 
flying to costa rica to salute the traditions of a nation and a 
people that in many ways represents the model for our entire 
hemisphere 
costa rica is no longer one of the few lonely democracies in 
the western hemisphere the president said in his departure 
statement indeed today there are only a few lonely holdouts 
against the sweep of democracy through the hemisphere 
i believe history will show that this hemispheres democratic 
resurgence helped set the stage for todays electrifying changes in 
the communist world bush said 
arias excluded the governments of panama cuba haiti and chile 
from the centennial celebration because they were not chosen in 
popular elections but he invited opposition leaders of both 
nicaragua and panama as observers including violeta chamorro who 
is running against ortega in nicaraguas presidential elections 
feb 25 
bush said he would bring up the problems of a fair election in 
nicaragua and arms shipments to el salvadors leftist guerrillas 
every chance i get 
there was no fixed agenda however and plans to issue even a 
general communique on democracy were scrapped when bush let it be 
known he would not sign a document that had ortegas name on it 
arias said he was not disappointed because the communique is 
usually put in a drawer and forgotten what we are trying to get 
out of this is a new dialogue an exchange of opinions 
ortega said the scrapping of the communique was no surprise 
thats a reflection of latinamerican reality that there is 
always bad feeling among our countries because of the way the 
united states behaves and because of bushs bad political and 
economic policy he said 
bush planned to meet with mrs chamorro and endara whom the 
united states considers the legitimate president of panama because 
of his victory in the may 7 elections which were annulled 
also scheduled to attend were michael manley of jamaica brian 
mulroney of canada jose sarney of brazil jose azcona hoyo of 
honduras carlos saul menem of argentina carlos andres perez of 
venezuela julio maria sanguinnetti of uruguay lynden pindling of 
the bahamas george price of belize rodrigo borja of ecuador 
desmond hoyt of guyana arthur robinson of trinidad and tobago and

bobby mclaughlin is about to get his due 
for the 6 years he spent in the gladiator school and other 
prisons for a murder he didnt commit 
but the 19 million award made last week by new york court of 
claims judge adolph orlando will barely begin to soothe the pain 
people think im winning the lottery or something the 
former new york resident said from his st paul apartment well 
they owe me if they had given me a choice i wouldnt have gone 
through all this for 50 million 
orlando awarded mclaughlin 15 million for loss of liberty 
mental stress anguish and loss of reputation the judge also 
ordered payment for lost wages and 225000 in medical expenses for 
treatment of mclaughlins addiction to cocaine and other drugs that 
stemmed from his prison experience 
its unlikely that he will ever survive the devastating trauma 
resulting from incarceration for a crime he did not commit the 
judge said 
mclaughlin 30 was convicted in 1979 in the new york borough of 
brooklyn for taking part in an armed robbery in which one person 
was killed mclaughlin received a 15year sentence 
mclaughlin said he was drinking with friends at a bar in his 
neighborhood the night of the killing he was arrested several days 
later because the primary suspect was reputed to associate with a 
robert w mclaughlin detectives mistook that man for bobby whose 
middle initial is k 
mclaughlin was picked out of a police lineup by a 15yearold 
witness who had been told by police that mclaughlin was a friend of 
the other suspect 
i kept telling myself it would end but it never did 
mclaughlin said i hated the system for not believing me it just 
seemed like they were god like they could do whatever they liked 
with my life 
the conviction was overturned in 1986 after mclaughlins foster 
father jarold hohne persuaded civil rights lawyer richard emery 
and a police sergeant to reopen the case after four years of 
relentless work the only witness who identified mclaughlin 
acknowledged he was wrong 
its been a nightmare for bobby from beginning to end emery 
said he faced it down and he survived like one has to but hes 
lost the critical years from 20 to 26 
thats how old mclaughlin was during his prison stays at rikers 
island sing sing elmira and comstock the last of those was known 
as the gladiator school because there were so many fights 
mclaughlin said 
they prey on the weak and your body is your weapon he added 
going into prison mclaughlin weighed about 150 pounds he 
emerged after six years of bodybuilding tipping the scales at 200 
pounds a physique he still maintains 
mclaughlin said he bulked up to protect himself against constant 
aggression 
he said he kept a bucket of water next to his bunk to defend 
against inmates known to start gasoline fires in enemy cells he 
guarded against early morning attacks by waking each day before his 
cell doors opened late sleepers were often attacked he said 
when mclaughlin returned to his brooklyn apartment he sometimes 
slept in the cellar because he feared police would knock on his 
door and return him to prison said thomas duffy the police 
sergeant who reopened the investigation 
that kids finished duffy said in a telephone interview 
from glendale ariz where he is retired no amount of 
counseling will make him normal again 
upon his release from prison mclaughlin said he reverted to the 
life he was leading at age 19 only to find many of his friends had 
careers and families and couldnt party with him at brooklyn bars 
his cocaine abuse started because he wanted to live the fast 
life i was trying to catch up too quick and it caught up with me 
the addiction led him to a treatment center in minnesota where 
he has lived for the past 18 months and worked as a painter and 
lawn sprinkler installer he plans to marry in april 
ive got a long way to go he said im 30 years old and i 
still dont know what im going to do with my life that hurts 
mclaughlin who still suffers from bouts of depression said he 
may have to settle for less than 19 million to avoid a lengthy 
appeal of the award by the state when he gets the money he says 
hell buy a nice car and a place to live 
ill go from there he said

a seafood promotion sank like a 
cherrystone friday when thousands of people mobbed a stand passing 
out free samples of frozen squid then chased a truck as it fled 
with tons of the coveted calamari 
an estimated 3500 rampaged through lisbons central rossio 
square trying to get their samples of the tentacled mollusk 
overturning flower stalls that fill the picturesque plaza 
police reinforcements were called in to quell the melee no 
arrests or injuries were reported 
the frozen squid giveaway was part of a promotional campaign by 
the portuguese institute for fisheries which announced thursday it 
would hand out 20 tons of squid around the country in an effort to 
boost sales of frozen seafood 
by 8 am long lines of bargainhungry citizens surrounded the 
flimsy wooden stall where the squid samples were to be given out 
two hours later the truck carrying eight tons of squid showed up 
at 10 am and the lines collapsed as thousands mobbed the stall 
the truck sped away only two minutes after the distribution 
began the crowd chased the truck across the square overturning 
stalls and circling a large ornamental fountain 
i wasnt afraid but ive never seen anything like it since the 
revolution said flower merchant albertina silva 57 who hurled 
buckets of water at the mob to keep them away from her stall 
she was referring to the april 25 1974 overthrow of the 
48yearold rightist dictatorship

several years ago otsego county sheriff 
martin ralph put his house his car and everything else he had in 
his wifes name he wants new yorks voters to do something about 
that on election day 
if she runs away tomorrow im homeless said ralph it 
shouldnt have to be that way 
ralph isnt having a fight with his wife and doesnt expect her 
to leave him instead hes battling to have what he believes is an 
onerous and antiquated provision of the state constitution 
eliminated 
that provision holds ralph and other state sheriffs personally 
liable for the acts of their departments and employees they are 
the only public officials in the state who face such potential 
personal liability for official acts 
when the states voters enter the ballot booth nov 7 theyll 
be able to decide on the fate of the provision with proposal 
number one an amendment 
should the amendment be approved residents can still sue the 
sheriff but they wont be able to get his home and car only money 
from the county 
peter kehoe executive director of the new york state sheriffs 
association said earlier this month there once was good reason for 
having the sheriffs held personally liable 
until the 1930s new york states sheriffs were unsalaried 
officials who got to keep all the fees collected by their offices 
the sheriff was essentially a private businessman said 
kehoe 
those fees could be substantial when a sheriff sold property to 
satisfy a court judgment he kept 5 percent of the selling price 
when he served a summons he got a fee 
they could become very wealthy said kehoe 
the job was so profitable that democrat al smith gave up his 
state assembly seat in 1915 to run for new york county sheriff 
having salted away between 50000 and 80000 in his twoyear 
term as sheriff according to a later biographer smith ran for and 
won the governorship in 1918 he later ran unsuccessfully for 
president 
the state law was later changed to make each sheriff a salaried 
employee of the county and to give the county all the fees 
salaries for sheriffs now range from 85000 a year in both 
westchester and monroe counties to the 25000 paid in rural 
schuyler county 
what wasnt changed was the constitutional provision making the 
sheriffs personally liable for official acts of their departments 
its a sword of damocles hanging over the sheriffs heads 
said kehoe fortunately the sword hasnt fallen 
so far the sheriffs have been lucky enough to have claims 
against them covered by the liability insurance thats carried by 
the counties kehoe said but insurance companies are questioning 
that coverage he said 
another problem said kehoe is the switch by many counties to 
selfinsurance a situation that could leave them without the legal 
authority to cover judgments against their sheriffs about 
onethird of counties have already become selfinsured he said 
its not a comfortable situation said kehoe the sheriffs 
are all worried about their families 
putnam county sheriff robert thoubboron said that while he 
hasnt put his assets in his wifes name the liability problem is 
a concern 
my predecessor raymond weizenecker died in office in 
february 1985 thoubboron said his estate was tied up in 
litigation as a result of a lawsuit brought against him while he 
was sheriff it took three years before that was finally resolved 
such concerns prompted the sheriffs association to ask the 
state legislature to approve the proposed constitutional amendment 
and send it to the voters both houses approved the proposed 
amendment unanimously 
they were quick to recognize that we were in jeopardy and were 
very sympathetic thoubboron said one of them said to me my 
god i dont know how you could take that kind of a job with such a 
risk

has not been forgotten

the outgoing un high commissioner for refugees 
said friday he resigned because it was increasingly difficult to do 
his job while the target of irresponsible attacks 
the resignation of jeanpierre hocke announced thursday at the 
united nations in new york followed allegations he misused a 
special un educational fund to subsidize firstclass air 
travel for himself 
hocke admitted he had flown first class a right reserved for 
the un secretarygeneral under stringent un austerity measures 
but denied any impropriety he said he had gone first class on some 
long intercontinental flights when he had a busy work schedule 
a danish statement said tuesday the account was opened for use 
by hockes danish predecessor poul hartling and that hocke showed 
a lack of judgment in believing assurances by a danish aide 
that he also could draw from it to cover travel expenses 
at denmarks request un secretarygeneral javier perez de 
cuellar ordered that an inquiry into the case be broadened 
at a news conference after returning to his native switzerland 
from new york hocke said his resignation does not reflect any 
sentiment of culpability on my part 
he said he did not feel pressured to resign and decided on his 
own to do so 
reading a statement hocke said the function of the high 
commissioner requires a total commitment and availability to act 
to convince and to galvanize 
that commitment was sapped by repeated and irresponsible 
attacks and destructive intentions of some people here and 
elsewhere he said without elaborating 
these were the considerations that led to my resignation 
which should not be seen as a withdrawal in the middle of the 
storm hocke added 
he said the agency will face a formidable challenge in the 
next few months when refugee protection and assistance will be more 
difficult than ever 
asked whether he was the victim of a campaign or realized he had 
made mistakes he said both 
i would never claim that i am free from making any mistakes 
he added 
gerald hinteregger of austria head of the un economic 
commission for europe was chosen as interim chief of the refugee 
agency the un general assembly will decide on a successor before 
the end of the year norway announced friday it named former 
foreign minister thorvald stoltenberg as a candidate for the job 
hocke was a former director of operations of the international 
committee of the red cross and became the un high commissioner 
for refugees in 1986 
during his tenure private relief agencies complained that hocke 
was bending to the restrictive national polices of major donor 
nations such as the united states japan and west germany rather 
than speaking out as the protector of refugees worldwide 
western nations are adopting more restrictive refugee policies 
accepting only those who can prove they are politically persecuted 
and excluding economic refugees 
hocke came under particularly strong criticism in january 1988 
when he ordered the burning of all 138000 copies of the agencys 
monthly magazine refugees because it contained an article 
critical of west germanys policy hocke said the article was 
outdated

mosquitoes are the latest scourge to 
follow in the wake of hurricane hugo but the air force reserve is 
coming to the rescue with an aerial bombardment on the pests this 
weekend 
the air force will use c130 airplanes to swoop down at 150 feet 
to douse the first of 10 counties with a pesticide to combat the 
burgeoning mosquito population 
the targeted areas are where high water from the hurricane and 
several inches of rain the following week left standing water that 
creates a perfect breeding haven for mosquitoes 
a total of 807000 acres in the state will be sprayed with the 
chemical dibrom which maj terry biery of the us air force 
reserve called the safest chemical for the project the spray kills 
living mosquitoes but has no effect on mosquito larvae 
the swarms of mosquitoes are presenting problems for residents 
and the mosquitoes were so numerous it was hard for some of the 
cleanup work to be done said pat wright of the state 
department of health and environmental control 
we also had our people out taking what we call landing rate 
counts ms wright said its a warm body who goes out where 
mosquitoes are breeding and stands for a minute counting the number 
of mosquitoes that land on them 
but she said most of the reports came back that the mosquitoes 
were too numerous to count 
the spraying that begins this weekend should be completed in 
eight to nine days depending on weather conditions the 500000 
tab will be picked up by the federal emergency disaster agency with 
hugo disaster funds 
it will be an unusual sight because a c130 airplane with a 
wingspan of 137 feet seldom flies so close to the ground 
the colorless odorless spray poses no danger to humans or pets 
although it can kill bees officials said 
this is one of the safest chemicals we could put out at one 
of the lowest doses we could put out biery said 
after the hurricane struck sept 21 the state health department 
asked the centers for disease control to check for mosquitoborne 
viruses ms wright said 
no viruses were found but local officials reported the mosquito 
population was much greater than normal 
the counties of berkeley dorchester georgetown sumter 
clarendon williamsburg orangeburg horry colleton and charleston 
will be sprayed officials said 
the areas that will be sprayed in charleston county include 
hardhit sullivans island the isle of palms and mcclellanville 
the raid on the mosquitoes will be conducted by crews from the 
907th tactical air group us air force reserve from rickenbacker 
air national guard base in ohio

the senate deliberating less than an hour 
friday approved an 85 billion military construction bill that 
makes wholesale cuts in president bushs request for foreign bases 
but adds millions of dollars for domestic installations 
by voice vote the senate adopted legislation that eliminates 
money for construction in the philippines and honduras while 
sweetening the military construction pot in the home states of 
ranking members of the appropriations committees 
the legislation approved by the house late thursday now goes 
to the president the white house has not indicated whether bush 
will sign the bill 
overall the bill includes 48 billion for military 
construction 32 billion for military family housing and 500 
million to begin closing 86 us bases and scaling back five others 
it cuts military construction spending in fiscal 1990 by 461 
million from what was spent in the fiscal year that ended sept 30 
and is 65 million below what bush wanted to spend this year 
i think weve seen the peak of military construction spending 
for many years to come sen james sasser dtenn chairman of 
the senate appropriations subcommittee on military construction 
told his colleagues before the vote its likely that next years 
military construction budget will be even smaller than the bill we 
approved here today 
targeted for elimination was 408 million bush proposed for 
dormitories storage facilities and other construction in the 
philippines 15 million for airfield improvements in honduras and 
144 million for an aircraft parking extension and other 
improvements at us bases in panama 
lawmakers also slashed bushs request for construction in 
britain from 108 million to 20 million for work in south korea 
from 86 million to 136 million and for work in italy from 708 
million to 516 million 
funding for overseas military bases will continue to be a low 
priority until our allies substantially improve their contribution 
to the common defense and until the results of arms control talks 
and base rights agreements are known sasser said 
while foreign bases suffered cuts national guard reserves and 
military facilities especially those in tennessee north carolina 
california iowa mississippi and west virginia saw significant 
increases 
the bush administration requested 873 million for an air 
station armories and other construction in tennessee sassers 
home state lawmakers approved 1092 million in the bill 
in north carolina home of rep wg hefner the democratic 
chairman of the house military construction subcommittee the bill 
earmarks 1338 million for fort bragg camp lejeune and other

americans personal income dealt a blow by 
hurricane hugo rose a lackluster 03 percent in september as 
consumer spending posted its weakest advance in a year the 
government said friday 
the commerce department said personal income in september rose 
128 billion at a seasonally adjusted annual rate to 447 
trillion the smallest increase in four months 
spending increased 02 percent the most anemic gain in 12 
months to an annual rate of 353 trillion 
september marks the beginning of the end of the consumer 
revival said economist allen sinai of the boston co because 
of sluggish income growth and caution in spending consumers will 
hunker down especially on bigticket items 
other signs of weakness in the month include a decline of 
103000 manufacturing jobs and a slight drop in orders for 
bigticket durable goods 
economists who this spring were expecting a recession to 
develop were somewhat relieved by a rebound in spending this 
summer 
however sinai predicted that consumer spending would shrink 
during the octoberdecember quarter a rare event that will lead 
to sluggish economic growth as measured by the gross national 
product at an annual rate of less than 1 percent he said by the 
first half of next year the nation will topple into a mild 
recession he forecast 
the government announced earlier this week that the gnp grew a 
moderate 25 percent in the third quarter the same as in the 
previous threemonth period 
other economists however noted that the september report was 
not as bad as it first appeared because consumer spending was held 
back by a swing in automobile purchases and incomes were depressed 
by onetime losses from hugo which struck north carolina and south 
carolina on sept 21 
its a mixed report but it wasnt terrible said economist 
michael k evans who heads a consulting firm in washington 
nobody thinks the economy is going to boom the question is 
whether its heading for a recession these numbers say no 
in other economic news the treasury department said the deficit 
for fiscal 1989 totaled 1521 billion a 31 billion improvement 
from 1988 analysts dismissed the decline as negligible noting 
that the deficit has been essentially the same for three years 
last months personal income growth followed an identical 03 
percent advance in august and a 06 increase in july spending 
posted robust gains of 09 percent in august and 08 percent a 
month earlier 
the report noted that without the effects of hugo incomes would 
have risen twice as much 06 percent in september the impact 
amounted to 13 billion at an annual rate most of that came in a 
9 billion drop in rental incomes which were figured after 
deducting uninsured losses from storm damage 
the key component of the income category wages and salaries 
increased 144 billion compared with a rise of 57 billion in 
august the hurricane reduced wages and salaries by about 2 
billion at an annual rate 
on the spending side the 87 billion increase in personal 
consumption spending which includes everything except interest 
payments on debt compared with a 33 billion increase in august 
purchases of durable goods items expected to last three or more 
years dropped 61 billion while nondurable goods purchases rose 
36 billion spending on services rose 113 billion 
a swing in new car purchases more than accounted for the 
september decline in durable goods and accounted for most of a 
194 billion increase in august 
this weakness in consumer spending is the aftermath of the car 
promotions this summer said economist sandra shaber of the 
futures group a washington consulting firm consumer spending is 
holding up 
the september report showed that americans income after taxes 
rose only 02 percent down from the 03 percent gain in august 
with income growing at the same rate as aftertax income 
americans savings rate held steady at 49 percent the same as in 
august but significantly less than the 56 percent rate in july 
shaber said that if it had not been for the hugo adjustments to 
income the savings rate would have shot up in september

the manufacturer of an inhaler for asthmatics 
is recalling the medication after just one month on the market 
because of reports of coughing choking and gagging after use the 
food and drug administration said friday 
the drug is a new formula of a commonly prescribed metered dose 
inhaler alupent 
the fda said the medication is being removed from the us

adverse reactions with the reformulation 
coughing with a choking or gagging sensation has been the most 
commonly reported complaint with the reformulated alupent the 
agency said in a statement 
no deaths or hospitalizations have been reported and experts 
have not determined whether the new formula caused the current 
problems 
however boehringer ingelheim a connecticutbased company that 
is the major supplier of the drug said it will remove the 
reformulation the us market and bring its previous formula back 
patients should contact their doctors or pharmacists to 
determine if medication they are taking is included in the recall 
in no case should patients discontinue their current asthma 
drug treatment unless directed to do so by a physician said fda 
commissioner frank e young 
young said most patients using the reformulation have not 
experienced the side effects and discontinuing prescribed asthma 
therapies could result in lifethreatening or fatal asthma 
attacks

several house democrats are asking their 
colleagues to stand firm in negotiations with the senate on a 
significant cut in the strategic defense initiative as congress 
moves toward completion of a 305 billion defense bill 
in a twopage letter to rep les aspin dwis chairman of the 
house armed services committee sixteen democratic members of the 
house said the spending level for sdi should be 328 billion not 
the 355 billion congressional negotiators are currently 
considering 
it would not be 355 billion a number which credits senate 
posturing by undistributed reduction amendments contained in both 
the senate authorization and appropriations bills the lawmakers 
said in the letter which was released friday 
we should count only sdi authorizations backed by 
appropriations and not based on undistributed reductions they 
said 
house members were referring to senate action last month on the 
defense appropriations bill initially the senate slashed 900 
million from president bushs request of 46 billion for the 
proposed antimissile shield but two days later in an attempt to 
gain room to manuever in negotiations with the house the senate 
restored 600 million 
the house in august approved 284 billion for the pentagons 
share of the program in its authorization bill the senate adopted 
a total of 43 billion in its authorization legislation 
currently house and senate conferees on the defense bill for 
the fiscal year that began oct 1 are considering a compromise 
total of 355 billion for the program popularly known as star wars 
any higher sdi number should be offset elsewhere with 
substantial concessions the letter said as senate armed 
services chairman sam nunn said recently sdi is a perishable 
commodity and it is going downhill on both sides of congress 
its a big pot of money and the goals are elusive and vague 
signing the letter were reps charles bennett of florida 
patricia schroeder of colorado ronald dellums of california lane 
evans of illinois george hochbrueckner of new york joseph brennan 
of maine jim olin of virginia steny hoyer of maryland edward

a crew of seismologists and geologists 
feverishly gathering data on the oct 17 earthquake spent little 
time giving it a name and nobody suggested the big one 
the 71 temblor was named loma prieta for a large but relatively 
indistinct flattopped mountain just three miles from the 
epicenter of the rupture the 3791foot high mountain one of the 
largest in the coastal range overlooks the santa clara valley and 
is 56 miles south of san francisco 
the us geological survey almost always names earthquakes for a 
geological feature closest to the origin of the first shock 
although there is no policy in place such as the one for naming 
hurricanes 
it was a very informal thing done within the first hour 
said spokeswoman pat jorgenson

a deputy coroner says firefighters who 
rescued 6yearold julio berumen from a car in the collapsed 
interstate 880 freeway after last weeks earthquake had to cut 
through the body of another woman not his mothers body to save 
the boys life 
the associated press and other news organizations reported oct 
19 and subsequently that the body of the boys mother petra 
berumen was cut by rescue workers to free him the reports came 
from rescue personnel at the scene but on thursday joseph 
blackwell a deputy coroner investigator for alameda county said 
it was the body of a family friend yolanda orozco who was a 
passenger in the car 
when the quake struck julio and his sister cathy 8 were 
riding home from the orthodontist with their mother and orozco the 
berumens car was crushed by a concrete pillar when the 
doubledecked interstate 880 in oakland collapsed trapping dozens 
of cars 
cathy escaped with head injuries but julio was trapped his 
legs pinned in the crumpled car 
rescuers used a chainsaw to cut through body of orozco allowing 
a doctor to reach julios right leg and amputate it at the knee to 
free him 
blackwell said berumens body also had to be cut to free it from 
the wreckage and that took place the day after the boy was freed 
doctors believe that julio and his 8yearold sister cathy 
will survive their injuries

the food and drug administration on friday 
completed regulations to guarantee that tampon absorbency labels 
mean the same thing regardless of what brand you buy 
today one brands regular or super may designate a much 
higher or lower absorbency than the same terms on another brand 
the agency said in a statement 
in the new system each term will correspond to a specific 
range of absorbency and manufacturers will use a standardized 
method to arrive at the absorbency for each type of tampon the 
statement said 
women use tampons which are sold in a range of thickness or 
absorbencies instead of sanitary napkins to control menstrual flow 
greater tampon absorbency has been associated with toxic shock 
syndrome a rare but sometimes fatal condition 
current tampon labeling requires a warning about the risks of 
tss and tampon use and a list of the symptons of the illness 
the new labels also must include an explanation of the 
absorbency range 
the standardization will permit purchasers to compare brands 
and health officials hope buy lower absorbency products to reduce 
their risk of toxic shock syndrome the fda added 
manufacturers have four months to comply with the new fda rule

three months worth of light bulbs have 
been stockpiled so has a months supply of sugar grapes have 
begun growing on hothouse vines 
before the first westernmanaged hotel in the east bloc could 
open its doors friday owners had to forage across a grim landscape 
of perpetual shortages import the goods it couldnt find and teach 
communisttaught wholesalers about supply and demand 
they also had to stop the toiletseat thieves 
the opening of 520room warsaw marriott marks completion of the 
first uspolish joint venture signed after the 1987 lifting of 
us trade sanctions imposed in response to the martiallaw 
crackdown of 1981 
it is viewed as a test of the profits and pitfalls awaiting 
major western investors in eastern europe 
rapid political changes provided a timely break for the 
partnership formed by the washingtonbased hotelier the austrian 
ilbau construction company and the polish airlines lot a 
noncommunist government bent on resurrecting the economy has taken 
over and both tourism and business traffic are swiftly growing 
marriott managers tried to recreate america in the 41story 
skyscraper which for the previous eight years had towered 
unfinished over warsaw as an embarrassing symbol of polands 
economic ruin 
people were sick and tired of seeing this building unfinished 
they felt ashamed said engineering director jan zonneveld but 
now i think warsaw residents are pretty happy it is a unique 
building the most luxurious 
managers spent about 70 million to put in gleaming marble 
plush carpeting and luxurious decorations seen nowhere else in 
poland 
they opened the only italian restaurant in poland the only 
steakhouse and the first casino and installed the only computer 
controlled air conditioning and heating system and the only hotel 
fire sprinkler network 
to open it marriott contractors imported spare parts for carpet 
factories trained waiters to bring the check unasked contrary to 
european custom and planted an italian herb garden in the head 
chefs backyard 
to keep it going the hotel is girded against scarcity 
no comparison sighed francois porte asked how the 
complexities of being the executive food and beverage director in 
shortageplagued poland compared with his last marriott assignment 
amman jordon 
the hotel has 38 walkin refrigeratorfreezers the storage 
rooms keep a months supply of all dry goods including coffee 
flour and sugar that cannot be counted on in polands 
shortageplagued market in addition it has threemonths supply 
of light bulbs to keep 52000 sockets filled 
a computer monitors supplies and can change menus within a day 
in case something runs out 
you go to a hotel restaurant in poland and say can i have 
this and they say oh no we dont have that today we dont 
have this today porte said i dont want to run into the same 
situation 
marriott has agreements with staterun farms and private 
greenhouses to grow lettuce tomatoes peppers and other vegetables 
virtually unavailable during the winter but it had to supply the 
seeds imported from holland 
it has its own canning and freezing plant provides yeast 
supplies to a brewery and sugar to a cola maker and planted its 
own greenhouse grapevines to counter coldweather fruit supplies 
meat was a tough problem porte said no one wanted to 
supply us they said they were already producing whatever they 
could produce 
deals finally were struck but the first day no meat arrived a 
symptom of the business ethic sapped by decades of undersupply and 
disregard for captive consumers 
they said simply they didnt have the meat and we said you 
promised we went back and told them how they could get the meat 
and what they could do to supply us porte said 
we basically are getting involved in their management we are 
not just buying the raw product we have to be involved in the 
production and teaching people how they can supply us he said 
room rates are in dollars only 135 a night but the 
restaurants deal in zlotys the prices are high but not out of 
sight for betteroff poles except perhaps for the tbone steak 
imported from the united states offered at 220000 zlotys an 
average monthly salary or the equivalent of 29 
salaries for the hotels 1000 employees are reviewed every 
three months to combat the 600 percent inflation rate and marriott 
went straight to manufacturers to ensure two pairs of shoes for 
every waiter and kitchen helper and three suits for each local 
manager 
although marriott tries to buy locally produced goods it still 
must order 80 percent to 90 percent of its materials from the west 
that creates a tremendous theft problem zonneveld said 
a lot of people are waiting for similar materials so they 
need to be guarded from the moment they get to the airport until 
they get to the hotel he said 
in the first two weeks before the official grand opening 130 
telephones disappeared along with toilet seats and showerheads 
guards stopped one television from walking out the front door 
it is understandable zonneveld said the people are poor 
and they are working in an environment where they see a lot of 
luxury items available

a baby who was born weighing about 10 ounces 
with feet smaller than her fathers thumbs spent her first night 
at home and was a little bit tired after her big day her 
father said friday 
were just real happy to have her home said james mann 
after his daughter madelines homecoming thursday madeline was 
born june 27 about three months before her due date weighing 
about 10 ounces 
normally the smallest a baby can survive is 500 grams about 
1 pound 1 ounce said madelines doctor jonathan muraskas but 
she came out with a little cry and her eyes were open 
her lungs were immature and she needed a lot of help but the 
best thing is that she developed no real significant neonatal 
problems 
the child who now weighs 4 pounds 3 ounces should become a 
normal healthy baby said muraskas she likely will be normal 
size by the time shes 1 years old doctors said 
the family was exhausted after the first night home mann said 
she had a rather big day yesterday he said we all did 
but for her it was one of her biggest were all a little bit 
tired 
we are so blessed said madelines mother robyn mann as 
they left loyola university medical center in suburban maywood 
as long as im alive as long as were a family i dont think 
ill ever be able to do anything to deserve this 
when deliveryroom nurses imprinted madelines ink footprint on 
the back of her fathers hand it was much smaller than his own 
thumb mann recalled 
i remember thinking i had never seen anyone so precious or 
small he said 
madelines mother developed a type of hypertension during the 
26th week of pregnancy that could have been fatal if she had 
carried the baby to term said muraskas a specialist in newborns 
the baby was delivered by caesarean section 
madelines birth weight of 280 grams or about 10 ounces is a 
fraction of an ounce less than the baby listed in the guinness book 
of world records as the smallest surviving infant 
this size is unheard of said muraskas but shes never 
had any major setbacks there must be good protoplasm in her 
family he joked

formed goon squads to beat up inmates considered troublemakers 
it really disturbs me even the thought of a goon squad

the allegations were made by jail workers quoted friday in the 
orlando sentinel which reported that bands of guards have 
allegedly punched kicked and slapped at least five inmates since 
june one was beaten for punching a guard the newspaper said 
if the statements are true something will be done polk 
said 
jail director duane rutledge said friday he didnt know of any 
goon squads but said his guards are firm with inmates 
we have to be able to work in a safe environment he said 
rutledge said he believes the reports are being disseminated by 
inmates and corroborated by a few disgruntled employees the 
newspaper said it did not use the names of jail workers it talked 
too because they requested anonymity out of fear for their jobs 
the sheriff appointed lt randy pittman to investigate the 
allegations and asked him to finish the probe by the end of next

for 15yearold gata kamsky the match with 
world chess champon garri kasparov was the peak to a remarkable 
year that began with his defection from the soviet union 
for kasparov thursday nights twogame match was just another 
exhibition and two routine victories 
im world champion hes not even grandmaster kasparov 
said afterward still its different weights heavyweight boxer 
and middleweight 
kamsky was considered one of the soviet unions more promising 
players when he and his father defected in march he topped a field 
of 15 american players including 12 grandmasters to earn the 
right to challenge kasparov 
the political undercurrent helped attract 300 spectators to the 
maxwell macmillan world chess challenge at the new york public 
library kamsky played with a small american flag on his side of 
the table 
the teenage challenger said he was distracted because he was 
thinking of his stepmother bella who he said is being held in the 
soviet union against her will 
i didnt know i would play until one day ago and i didnt 
prepare right kamsky said i keep in my mind my stepmother so 
it was not good for me right now i didnt do my best 
kasparov stayed away from the immigration issue 
i play chess he was my opponent kasparov replied when 
asked if such matches can further thaw political relations between 
the soviet union and the united states 
i had to beat him and i had nothing else in my mind if it 
helps relations ok said the world champion who last weekend 
twice defeated the worlds strongest chess computer program deep 
thought 
it took kasparov less than a halfhour and 51 moves to win the 
first game against kamsky the second lasted 109 moves 
kasparov 26 of the soviet city of baku in azerbaijan is a 
former prodigy himself he became a grandmaster 10 years ago and 
won the world championship in 1985 
kamsky and his father rustem defected from the soviet union in 
march while attending a chess tournament in new york 
the two had scheduled a news conference before the thursday 
chess match to demand the release of mrs kamsky but the senior 
kamsky said that kasparov would not have played if they had held 
the news conference 
the match marked the first time since 1907 that a reigning world 
chess champion played a headtohead match on us soil kasparov 
played the computer via telephone lines 
grant mccrea of the special committee for chess in america 
said the first match between kasparov and kamsky reminded him of 
kasparovs handy victory over deep thought 
i dont think gata is used to this kind of pressure he can 
put up a better fight than he did we saw that earlier this week 
mccrea said

in the memo dated oct 25 watkins told under secretary john 
tuck the no 3 department official to immediately take over as 
acting assistant secretary for defense programs 
the vital national security mission of the department can 
no longer be carried out under the current management 
arrangement watkins wrote in the memo 
stello was nominated for the job july 24 but the senate has not 
even scheduled a confirmation hearing many environmental groups 
and some prominent members of congress are strongly opposed to 
stello contending he is weak on nuclear safety 
watkins has publicly defended stello and in the memo he said 
it is my hope that the nomination will be acted upon 
expeditiously he did not elaborate except to say the stalled 
nomination was creating a serious leadership vacuum 
in the memo watkins said john l meinhardt who took the post 
of acting assistant secretary for defense programs earlier this 
year had told him changes were needed 
i concur in his assessment that defense programs has operated 
far too long without the leadership and direction that can only 
evolve from a duly appointed and confirmed assistant secretary 
watkins wrote 
watkins told tuck he would take on the additional title of 
acting assistant secretary for the time being pending 
confirmation of the presidents nominee to this important post 
no mention was made of what job if any meinhardt would take 
an aide to meinhardt said he was not immediately available for 
comment spokesmen for watkins did not return a reporters phone 
calls 
the weapons office is in charge of a government complex of 17 
major nuclear facilities in 12 states that develop build and test 
nuclear weapons for the pentagon 
stello has worked as a special assistant to watkins on planning 
for the restart of idled reactors at the savannah river nuclear 
weapons complex since july he came to the department from the 
nuclear regulatory commission where he was chief of staff 
greenpeace usa which has headed a national campaign to block 
stellos nomination applauded watkins decision to put tuck 
temporarily in charge of the weapons program 
we take this as a tacit admission by the doe of serious 
problems with stellos nomination said stephen schwartz a 
greenpeace spokesman in washington 
greenpeace sent a letter friday to president bush urging 
withdrawal of the stello nomination 
there is absolutely no question that the urgent tasks facing 
the doe at its nuclear weapons production facilities demand an 
individual of exceptional integrity and ability victor stello is 
not that individual the letter said

the fbi said friday its laboratory studies of 
the uss iowa disaster found no evidence that any device was 
deliberately used to detonate the blast that killed 47 sailors 
we didnt find anything that would lead us to conclude that a 
device was used to prematurely detonate the charge fbi spokesman 
mike kortan said 
thats not to say something wasnt there our findings were 
inconclusive he said 
but the chairman of the house armed services investigations 
subcommittee said he reads the fbis laboratory report as 
undermining the navys findings of evidence suggesting a detonating 
device caused the blast 
the fbis lab report has been described as inconclusive 
rep nicholas mavroules dmass said in a letter i do not see 
it that way 
it clearly says that they did not find elements that the navy 
technicians said they found mavroules wrote in a letter to rep 
mary rose oakar dohio 
oakar had requested an investigation of the navys findings that 
a former constituent gunners mate clayton hartwig was most 
likely responsible for detonating the blast 
mavroules assured oakar that his subcommittee staff would 
aggressively pursue its investigation of the navys findings 
i seriously question the conclusion that it was a wrongful 
intentional act even if so is there adequate evidence linking 
clayton hartwig to the cause of the explosion mavroules wrote 
we are also looking at the quality of the nis investigation 
and more disturbing why was a report released before all 
investigative efforts were concluded mavroules wrote 
also on capitol hill sen sam nunn dga chairman of the 
senate armed services committee said he has asked the general 
accounting office to inquire more thoroughly into the adequacy of 
the investigative effort and to validate the conclusions of the 
investigation 
in a letter to comptroller general charles a bowsher who heads 
the gao nunn repeated his plans to hold hearings on the navys 
investigation of the iowa blast after the senate and house complete 
work on the fiscal 1990 defense authorization bill 
nunn said he was concerned with certain issues which arose 
during the navys investigation but which were not pursued since 
they were not considered to be immediately relevant to the specific 
task at hand 
specifically the senator cited the cause of the april 19 
explosion once equipment malfunction and accident had been ruled 
out 
the navy meanwhile continued to defend its finding that a 
chemically ignited explosive device most probably was placed in 
the breech of one of the battleships 16inch guns to detonate the 
blast which killed 47 sailors april 19 
the navy is convinced that foreign material was found in a 
band of the projectile of the gun said cmdr mark baker a navy 
spokesman 
we are confident about the sophistication of our equipment and 
the expertise of our technical personnel that conducted thousands 
of tests baker said 
the fbis tests were conducted as a result of a request from the 
navy to conduct a metallurgical analysis of residue found in the 
gun and on the barrel of the projectile kortan said 
the bureau was asked by the navy to conduct an independent 
examination of the materials they gave us in an attempt to 
determine if there was some evidence of a device 
we looked at them and we cant draw that conclusion kortan 
said what they did in their own testing proceure it is not 
appropriate to comment on 
mavroules questioned the navys theories about hartwig and why 
it focused its investigation almost entirely on him 
the navy concluded that hartwig who died in the blast had been 
upset about the breakup of a friendship with another sailor 
there had been reports based on unidentified sources that navy 
investigators theorized that hartwig was distraught over rejection 
of homosexual advances 
mavroules said i am not sure what the issue of homosexuality 
has to do with the matter at hand even though the navys central 
lines of inquiry focused on allegations of hartwigs homosexuality 
alleged suicidal tendances and knowledge of explosives 
only a handful of individuals of the hundreds interviewed 
avowed any knowledge of hartwigs homosexuality mavroules wrote 
no on had any firsthand knowledge

christian leader gen michel aoun on 
friday issued what he termed the last call for christian 
legislators to return home to discuss a peace plan and said he 
might dissolve parliament if they dont 
aoun also indicated he might dissolve parliament to block the 
election of a president which the plan mandates 
his statements coincided with brief skirmishing between aouns 
troops and syrianbacked druse militiamen in souk elgharb 
southeast of beirut police reported no casualties 
aoun in a speech to supporters at his shellshattered palace in 
suburban baabda accused the christian lawmakers of reckless 
behavior and said if they persist in this behavior the 
government will use its powers 
he said his cabinet has many choices one of them is 
dissolving parliament 
the general who heads a threeman christian military cabinet in 
lebanons splintered government apparently still hopes to scuttle 
the peace plan reached by lebanese legislators in the saudi arabian 
resort of taif on sunday 
aoun rejected the plan because it did not include a deadline for 
the withdrawal of syrian troops from lebanon christian legislators 
do not want to return to lebanon because they fear aoun will have 
them arrested 
the accord sponsored by the arab league calls for parliament 
to meet in lebanon no later than nov 7 to ratify reforms that 
would give more political power to moslems and clear the way for 
election of a president 
the plan must be ratified by a parliament session in lebanon to 
take effect 
aoun said at a news conference later that it would be 
illogical to try to elect a president in so short a period of 
time 
asked whether he would block election by dissolving parliament 
aoun said thats an alternative among others 
moslems have accused aoun of trying to prevent presidential 
elections so he can remain at the helm in lebanons 310squaremile 
christian enclave 
lebanon has been without a head of state since sept 22 1988 
when president amin gemayels sixyear term ended and parliament 
was unable to agree on a successor 
gemayel named aoun head of an interim military cabinet to rule 
pending election of a new head of state but the cabinet split 
after moslems pledged allegiance to acting prime minister salim 
hoss 
aoun claims that most lebanese support him and said of the 33 
christian lawmakers who voted for the plan maybe when they 
return from saudi arabia they will not be able to face their 
supporters because they have betrayed everybody so i will have to 
protect them by assigning bodyguards for them 
he said the legislators are under obligation to return to 
lebanon to persuade their constituents to accept the plan 
if they manage to convince you ill call you to follow them 
and ill follow them too but if they dont then they will have to 
call off the taif operation he said 
his remarks contrasted with a statement thursday in which he 
also urged the lawmakers to return for talks but made no threats 
a christian source speaking on condition of anonymity said the 
general apparently upgraded his attacks again after realizing 
that the legislators were not going to listen to him 
also friday arab league envoy lakhdar ibrahimi held talks in 
christian east beirut with aoun and danny chamoun commander of the 
rightwing national liberal party 
he later crossed beiruts dividing green line into west beirut 
for talks with moslem leaders

foreign businesses in moscow will reap the 
benefits of a drastically devalued ruble a state bank official 
said friday meaning they can pay staff and some other bills with 
cheaper rubles 
the soviet union on wednesday announced a devaluation of the 
ruble from 159 to 16 cents for foreign and soviet travelers cash 
exchanges starting nov 1 the higher rate will remain on 
commercial transactions 
foreign businessmen living in the soviet union also will receive 
the more favorable rate when changing cash said valery pekshev 
deputy chairman of the state bank 
asked at a news conference if businesses could use those funds 
to pay their soviet staff pekshev said if you have withdrawn 
cash from your foreign currency account you have the right to 
exchange your currency and nobodys going to control how you spend 
it 
however the change will have limited effect because the soviet 
government requires foreigners to use hard currency in paying many 
of their expenses including rent and office telephone bills most 
soviets working for foreigners also receive part of their salary in 
foreign currency 
pekshev said the ruble is being devalued because the official 
rate of 159 per ruble was not realistic he also cited a need 
to undercut the black market where tourists could receive up to 20 
times as many rubles for their convertible currency as in state 
bank outlets 
foreign travelers largest expenses for hotels and 
transportation must be paid in foreign currency to intourist the 
state tourist agency but pekshev said visitors may see a break 
here as well 
intourist will take the new exchange rate into account when 
negotiating new contracts with tour companies he said 
pekshev said the devaluation had been contemplated in summer but 
authorities did not want to disrupt the tourist season 
the limit on the amount of currency soviet citizens may exchange 
when traveling abroad will be raised so they will continue to 
receive about 300 each pekshev said but they will have to pay 10 
times as many rubles for that same small cache of spending money 
this will reduce the number of soviets traveling simply to buy 
coveted western goods in short supply at home pekshev said many 
soviets have been able to pay for their trips by bringing home such 
highly profitable items as a 2000 computer and selling it for 
50000 rubles 
we used to give them 318 for 200 rubles and they would make 
4000 to 5000 rubles off it he told the labor newspaper trud 
if the state takes not 200 rubles from them but 2000 it will 
be only fair 
although the ruble is still many years from becoming fully 
convertible pekshev said other adjustments are being made soviet 
exporters are due to receive a ruble bonus on their foreign 
currency earnings starting jan 1 
in addition a foreign currency auction among soviet enterprises 
is underway companies submitted closed bids to the vnesheconombank 
to buy or sell their foreign currency and next week officials 
expect to match them up 
gennady mazonov a senior researcher in the institute of world 
social system economics specializing in ruble convertibility said 
the devaluation was a happy unexpected surprise but said it 
should have gone as far as 10 cents to the ruble to compete with 
black market rates 
as it is he noted soviet tourists will still need more than 
300 each to travel abroad and there will be no effect on the 
unsatisfied hunger for foreign currency

prime minister yitzhak shamir said friday that 
reports of israeli nuclear cooperation with south africa were 
designed to tear the fabric of israels relations with the 
united states 
analysts and media reports viewed the leaks as a form of 
pressure on shamir to accept us peace proposals before he visits 
washington in midnovember 
they also said the reports could affect talks on economic and 
military aid for israel which totaled 3 billion this year and 
block israeli requests for supercomputers that could be used to 
develop ballistic missiles 
nbc news reported that israel provided south africa with missile 
technology in exchange for a steady supply of uranium and use of a 
south african missile test range israel has denied it 
in an interview friday with israels arabic tv program shamir 
said he believed the aim was to tear the fabric of israelius 
relations but i dont think it will harm them 
he said israel was trying to bridge differences with secretary 
of state james a baker iii about plans for palestinianisraeli 
talks 
yossi ahimier the prime ministers spokesman said the aim of 
reports about ties to south africa was to whip up antiisraeli 
public opinion 
someone is trying to depict israel as an enemy of peace or a 
negative factor in the region he told the associated press 
housing minister david levy of shamirs rightwing likud bloc 
said such pressure contradicted us assurances that washington 
would not turn its back or impose on israel something that is 
against the governments interest 
should israel raise its hands and give over its policy on such 
a sensitive issue concerning its existence he said on army 
radio on no account should it 
dore gold a specialist in usisraeli relations at tel aviv 
universitys jaffee center for strategic studies said the reports 
resulted from increased tensions between israel and the united 
states 
usually at a time of tension past us administrations have 
tried to lower israels moral credibility in washington he said 
in addition to disagreements over the baker plan gold said 
israel is at odds with the bush administration over the sale of m1 
tanks to saudi arabia 
questioning the veracity of the nbc report gold said a joint 
project was not very sensible because israel did not need an 
intercontinental ballistic missile and the main threats to south 
africa were from countries with 1950s and 1960s arms technology 
harry wall director for israel of the antidefamation league of 
bnai brith said the result was more likely to be a rallying of 
israelis around shamir than support for us peace proposals 
i think it is more than coincidental that this report was 
aired at such a sensitive time he said if this was a leak 
intended to soften israel i doubt that it will work the last 
thing this government needs to break the impasse is additional us 
pressure 
a defense ministry statement issued friday denied as lacking 
all truth another nbc report that israel transferred technology 
from the usfinanced lavi fighter plane project to south africa 
after the program was canceled 
it said israel had not transferred us technology or systems 
with us components to south africa or any other country 
phil herman a spokesman for israel aircraft industries which 
made the lavi prototypes said he did not know whether lavi 
technicians went to work in south africa 
he declined comment on technology transfers except to say 
there are certain avionics that are on the open market for 
approved customers 
israeli officials denounced as lies the nbc report that 
israel was helping south africa develop a longrange missile that 
was testfired last summer 
they said israel had adopted a policy in 1987 not to sign new 
defense agreements with south africa in response to a 
congressional dewcision to suspend aid to any nation selling arms 
to that country

here is a text of the remarks of peggy say 
sister of terry anderson at a ceremony friday marking the 42nd 
birthday of the associated press chief middle east correspondent 
who has been held captive in lebanon since march 1985 
once again i have to grope for words to tell carmela laspada 
how deeply grateful i am for no greater loves sponsoring of yet 
another ceremony on behalf of terry anderson and the other 
hostages this is the 20th such ceremony and without carmelas 
devotion and dedication to our cause im afraid the hostage issue 
would have been forgotten long ago carmela for terry and the 
other hostages their families and friends i thank you 
to all of you who are participating and those attending this 
ceremony bless you terrys friends my friends members of the 
jctfta journalists committee to free terry anderson my ap 
family relatives especially my husband david and hostage 
family members you are my strength and without your support year 
after frustrating year i could not go on 
i know that each of you shares my pain as we gather here today 
to mark terrys 42nd birthday his fifth in captivity and to 
take part in this mass of hope 
i felt it was touchingly appropriate when carmela christened 
this particular ceremony a mass of hope i feel that hope is 
the common thread that binds us all together our capacity for hope 
is remarkable after enduring months and years of this terrible 
ordeal 
i have a plaque in my home that reads hope is not a way out 
it is a way through it is indeed it is that hope that motivates 
us to approach every ceremony in the belief that it will be the 
last it is hope that compels carmela to keep her plans for a 
welcome home party always at the ready 
despite years of crushed expectations false signs and broken 
dreams who among us is not ready to believe that today could be 
the day our miracle happens whose heart does not flutter when the 
telephone rings at odd hours hoping that this will be the call 
the one that brings our moment of joy hope is our willingness to 
believe against desperate odds that we will soon board a plane to 
wiesbaden for a reunion with our loved ones 
hope is what urges us to plan every day as if we might need to 
leave in haste no longterm projects no clothing long 
unlaundered no suitcase far from reach hope is what sustains us 
all especially those who must live in defiance of chains that bind 
them and cloths that blind them 
it is far easier for us their families and friends to maintain 
hope we have one another but for these remarkable men to live 
with hope in the face of such desperate conditions is a testament 
to their courage their faith and the dignity with which they 
exist 
it is with hope that i pray every day every night that 
something positive will emerge from the rubble and chaos we call 
lebanon that the hearts of their captors will be softened and our 
innocent men will be reunited with their families i live with the 
hope that the release of our hostages will in some way play a role 
in the healing of deep wounds between our arab brothers and 
ourselves 
it is my deepest hope that our hostages will not have suffered 
so much for so long in vain and for nothing i hope to see in my 
lifetime and for my children and my grandchildren a time of peace 
and reconciliation among all countries of the world for then with 
the psalmists we will see that kindness and truth shall meet 
justice and peace shall kiss truth shall spring out of the earth 
and justice shall look down from heaven 
i pray for our hostages and for us all that we never lose our 
capacity for hope that ability to believe in the potential promise 
of each new day some day soon please god our miracle will 
happen until then we will live as we always have in faith and 
hope thank you and god bless you all

the federal budget deficit totaled 1521 
billion in 1989 marking the third year of essentially unchanged 
fiscal red ink the government said friday 
for the first time interest on the 28 trillion national debt 
exceeded social security spending pushing the interest category 
into second place behind military expenditures 
the budget gap for the year ending sept 30 marked a 31 
billion or 2 percent improvement over the 1552 billion deficit 
in 1988 the treasury department and the office of management and 
budget said in a joint announcement 
but it was still more than the 1987 deficit of 1497 billion 
all three years are well under the record high of 2211 billion in 
1986 
budget director richard darman told reporters he was not 
satisified with the deficit but said the good news is that 
the deficits are not heading up 
private economists however dismissed the small improvement 
and predicted a rising tide of red ink in 1990 
they noted that the deficit was nearly 10 billion smaller 
simply because the government failed in a lastminute rush to 
complete five large savings and loan rescues 
the resolution trust corp a new agency created to bail out the 
sampl industry spent 91 billion by sept 30 instead of the 188 
billion anticipated the 97 billion difference will add to the 
deficit in 1990 
the promises that have come out of washington about budget 
balancing have been unfulfilled said economist william v 
sullivan jr of dean witter reynolds inc 
we see virtually no progress on the budgetary front and doubt 
the government can print 150 billion deficits for the indefinite 
future without some sort of adverse consequences for this 
economy he warned 
in august the bush administration projected a 1990 deficit of 
1162 billion automatic spending cuts ordered under the 
grammrudman law would reduce that to 100 billion but the 
administration and congress could avoid the automatic cuts by 
agreeing to a spending package with an official budget gap of 110 
billion 
however the congressional budget office is projecting a 
substantially higher deficit of 140 billion and private analysts 
say even thats optimistic 
i think grammrudman is just a fiction i would say the 
deficit this coming year is going to be at least 160 billion 
possibly as much as 175 billion said michael k evans an 
economic consultant in washington 
he said weak economic growth in 1990 will cut into corporate 
income tax payments which totaled 1033 billion in 1989 that was 
up from 942 billion in 1988 however corporations paid 194 
billion in income taxes in september down from 206 billion in 
june the previous month in which quarterly payments were due 
also sullivan said the 1989 deficit was held down by a 
onetime approximately 15 billion surge in personal income tax 
payments in april for the 1988 tax year he said taxpayers deferred 
income from 1987 to 1988 to take advantage of a decline in tax 
rates provided by the 1986 tax overhaul 
evans said interest payments will continue to be a growing 
burden on the government 
if you take interest payments out the deficit pretty much 
vanishes we have spending pretty much under control now but we 
have to pay for the fact that earlier it wasnt under control he 
said

the seven east bloc foreign ministers 
affirmed a policy of not interferring in the affairs of each 
others nations as they ended the first warsaw pact meeting led by 
polands solidarity government 
the twoday meetings final communique also urged speeding up 
disarmament of conventional chemical and shortrange nuclear 
weapons and stressed the inviolability of european borders 
but no direct mention was made of the touchy area of economic 
relations within the east bloc or the problems of east germany 
where an exodus of citizens and mass protests this month led the 
ruling communists to replace aging leader erich honecker 
as much as the situation is undefined conditions are 
ripening for a breakthrough that would overcome the division of 
europe and definitely eliminate the relics of the cold war the 
communique said 
essential is the right of every nation to independent decision 
making about its road to social political and economic 
development without outside interference it said 
the foreign ministers met in closed sessions their debates were 
filled with controversy but no open antagonisms foreign ministry 
official boleslaw kulski of poland said at a news conference 
poland hungary and the soviet union as well as east germany to 
a lesser extent are experimenting with radical reforms but the 
remaining warsaw pact nations czechoslovakia bulgaria and 
romania have resisted change 
kulski said some sensitive topics such as romanias call only 
two months ago for warsaw pact action to prevent formation of 
polands solidarityled government were not even brought up 
no one considered it advisable or desirable to raise this 
issue during the meeting he said 
although differences surfaced kulski said i want to 
emphasize that there was no case when the differences led to 
antagonizing of the participants and they never took a form that 
would be improper for this friendly meeting 
the main sensitive area was economic relations within the east 
bloc he said 
the nations that are reforming their economies want to put trade 
relations on a market basis using convertible currencies and 
allowing economic relations directly between enterprises instead of 
only between governments 
such changes leave nonreforming countries increasingly isolated 
within the east bloc undermining their access to imports and raw 
materials from other warsaw pact nations or markets for the goods 
they produce 
solidarity took control of polands government on aug 24 
becoming the first noncommunist government since the east bloc 
came in existence following the end of world war ii 
prime minister tadeusz mazowiecki a longtime solidarity 
activist and former political prisoner used the meeting to 
reassure alliance members that poland will respect its east bloc 
military and economic commitments and that democracy in poland does 
not threaten the security of its neighbors 
he also called for radically restructuring comecon the 
organization that coordinates economic relations among the seven 
pact countries to make it more marketoriented and stressed the 
need to respect the internal sovereignty of pact nations 
the changes that are going on in poland now lead to 
normalizing the internal situation and thus indirectly to 
stability of european relations mazowiecki said 
poland is true to her commitments as an ally and fulfills her 
duties stemming from this

immigration applications from soviet jews who for 
years have been refused exit visas by soviet officials will be 
given special consideration by the us embassy jewish activists 
said friday 
the plan is to give those soviet jews priority over the 
thousands of other soviet citizens now seeking to emigrate to 
america and swamping the us embassy according to the activists 
they said the arrangement to help the soviet jews known as 
refuseniks because of the kremlins refusal to grant them exit 
visas was organized during a visit by a delegation from the union 
of councils for soviet jews 
the 75member delegation representing groups in the the united 
states israel and europe came to the soviet union to meet with 
the refuseniks and local jewish organizations 
they were allowed to come only after they agreed on terminology 
making it clear the trip was unofficial michah naftalin the 
organizations us national director told a news conference 
under new american regulations that went into effect oct 1 
because of the crush of applicants at the us embassy 
applications are sent directly to washington for evaluation rather 
than being processed by the us embassy 
embassy officials said they expect to receive 300000 
applications next year the united states under ceilings set in 
washington will then accept 50000 soviet applicants and another 
2000030000 people on a socalled parole system that does not 
guarantee government support 
soviet jewish activists fear that if and when exit visas are 
issued to longtime refuseniks who they say number about 100 their 
applications to enter the united states will be lost in the flood 
of paperwork 
according to the genevabased intergovernmental committee on 
migration 7469 jews left the soviet union in september the 
largest outflow since the organization began monthly counts in 1979 
leonid stonov a soviet jew and chairman of the moscow refusenik 
legal seminar said a group has been organized to work with embassy 
officials to make certain washington is informed when a refusenik 
is granted an exit visa by the soviets 
he said the operation should be in place in about two weeks 
most of the refuseniks have been denied permission to leave on 
grounds they have knowledge of state or military secrets from 
former jobs in most cases soviet officials put a fiveyear freeze 
on exit visas for people believed to have had access to secrets but 
the freeze has been for decades in some cases 
during their 10day stay in the soviet union the union of 
council delegates met with human rights leaders in moscow and 
leningrad 
they held seminars and meetings to discuss antisemitism in the 
soviet union the plight of refuseniks proposed emigration reforms 
and plans to establish independent organizations to foster jewish 
culture in the soviet union

jane pauley became a readyforprimetime player 
friday as she told today viewers she will leave the nbc program 
she has cohosted for 13 years 
pauley whose move was expected and had been preceded by weeks 
of reports that she was unhappy on today and wanted out said 
she would leave the show at the end of the year 
however she said she had extended her contract at nbc through 
1992 and she hugged her announced successor today news anchor 
deborah norville and gave her an alarm clock 
in an interview later pauley said there had been a happy ending 
to what had been tense talks with nbc news executives she will 
host a primetime special in march do special reports for the 
nbc nightly news and coanchor a new newsmagazine series 
premiering in june nbc said 
but she said she once had felt that nbc executives wanted her to 
leave the show the one in charge of today denied this and 
that she herself had wanted to leave because of various changes on 
it 
although taking pains not to blame norville she said the one 
change that probably triggered her thought of leaving came last 
month when norville replaced john palmer as today news anchor 
nbc assigned him norvilles former anchor job on the earlier nbc 
news at sunrise 
norvilles expanded role on today in which she shared the 
same desk and thus exposure as pauley and cohost bryant gumbel 
was only one of a number of changes that had weighed on her mind 
pauley said she didnt elaborate 
but talks with nbc news president michael gartner and nbc sports 
president dick ebersol who last summer also was given today to 
oversee left her feeling that they werent thinking of her future 
she said 
we didnt believe each other she said they did not 
believe that i simply wanted to leave the today show i did not 
believe that they were committed to my future here at nbc 
yes she said when asked if she thought they wanted her to 
leave the show she didnt elaborate 
nbc sports president dick ebersol who made the switch that put 
norville on today said this and other changes accomplished or 
planned were being done to position the show for the nineties 
suggesting that perhaps pauley had been misunderstood by a 
reporter he insisted that he and gartner had urged her to stay on 
the show 
a proposal this month for what will be her march special 
changes about people who have faced personal and professional 
change proved the breakthrough for what has become pauleys new 
deal at nbc he said 
i cant tell you what a happy ending this story has had for 
me said pauley who was 25 when she joined today in 1976 
after barbara walters the shows first fulltime female anchor 
left to join abc 
during fridays broadcast she took care to play down reports 
she was at odds with either gumbel or norville saying it has 
hurt to see two of my friends bryant and deborah assigned roles 
in this that they did not play 
in her postshow interview pauley said she will continue 
cohosting the show through the end of year and possibly into early 
january she also will substitutehost in january when gumbel and 
norville are on vacation ebersol said 
norville whose news anchor replacement probably wont be named 
until december according to nbc said in an interview she was 
relieved that all the uproar over the show finally appears to be 
ending 
she also said she was offended by some reports suggesting that 
at the heart of the uproar is a situation akin to all about 
eve the movie about a young actress scheming to oust an aging 
theater star 
its sexism pure and simple said norville 31 who began 
in tv news 11 years ago while attending the university of georgia 
and anchored at nbcowned wmaqtv in chicago before joining nbc 
news in january 1987 
as a woman and a reporter im offended that the suggestion 
would be made that two capable competent women cant work in a 
collegial way on the same program in 1989 thats nonsense

did ernest hemingway alias frederic henry really 
have the steamy love affair with his red cross nurse agnes von 
kurowsky alias catherine barkley that his novel a farewell to 
arms suggests 
one of the juicier questions racing around literary circles for 
years its answer is contained in von kurowskys diary for 1918 
made public friday for the first time a hemingway scholar says 
is there any evidence to suggest that they consummated their 
relationship at any point professor james nagel of northeastern 
university said 
my answer is no 
nagel and henry villard an 89yearold retired us diplomat 
who knew hemingway and von kurowsky and donated her diary to the 
john f kennedy librarys hemingway archive say the novel was just 
the wishful thinking of a young writer in a more prudish era 
the slender yellowing diary provides the basis for nagel and 
villards new book hemingway in love and war the lost diary of 
agnes kurowsky her letters and correspondence of ernest 
hemingway 
hemingway was 19 when he met von kurowsky a 26yearold nurse 
from philadelphia 
after leaving a job as a cub reporter on the kansas city star to 
see some action in world war i hemingway was running a canteen on 
the italian front when shrapnel from an austrian mortar landed him 
in a milan hospital under von kurowskys care and under her spell 
the events of those months in 1918 became the nugget of his 1929 
novel a farewell to arms 
whether the novels account of a passionate liaison between a 
soldier and a nurse was based in fact has long fueled debate among 
hemingway mavens 
certainly the diary gives hemingway prominent mention in july 
1918 von kurowsky wrote that hemingway was the first american 
wounded in italy by august she observed that hemingway had a 
case on me in september there was a fuss when another nurse 
found a hairpin of agnes under ernies pillow she wrote 
but she also was dismayed by overtly sexual behavior at the 
hospital a distaste that by her account hemingway shared 
on sept 19 von kurowsky wrote about finding a nurse and a 
patient having a high old time in a chaise lounge on the 
balcony she noted hem was furious amp it was so common i 
couldnt get over them 
villard who was laid up at the time with jaundice and malaria 
in a room adjoining hemingways said he and other patients shared 
a hankering for the nurse from philadelphia 
all the boys fell for agnes said villard who was an 
18yearold harvard freshman at the time but a dinner date was 
about all they could hope for he said 
standards were pretty strict and moral in those days 
villard said we were all very much virgins in those days 
villard now living in the bahamas said he renewed his 
friendship with von kurowsky after hemingways suicide in 1961 
she called her socalled affair a flirtation he said 
hemingway was desperately in love with her and wanted her to 
marry him she led him on to believe she would but as she told me 
herself she was very fickle in those days 
when von kurowskys ardor for hemingway cooled she wrote him a 
dear john letter in march 1919 saying she was sorry for 
unwittingly deceiving him and that her fondness was more as a 
mother than as a sweetheart 
i cant get away from the fact that youre just a boy a 
kid she wrote according to nagel and villards book 
villard helped von kurowsky secure a grave site for herself in a 
national cemetery among war veterans when she died in 1984 at the 
age of 92 she bequeathed villard her world war i papers 
nagel said the diary shows the imaginative leap hemingway made 
between his life and his fiction 
it clarifies a great deal about two things what really 
happened to hemingway in world war i and how hemingway used real 
experiences and how he transformed them nagel said

journalist terry andersons friends and 
colleagues prayed for an end to his special cruelty friday and 
vowed not to forget him at a mass of hope on his 42nd birthday 
his fifth in captivity 
andersons relatives professional colleagues and diplomats 
filled a chapel at georgetown university for an hourlong ceremony 
on a day that president bush and congress proclaimed national 
hostage awareness day 
the celebrants prayed listened to psalms and received communion 
at a mass officiated by the rev lawrence madden 
as long as he is a hostage we are not free said tom 
brokaw the nbc anchorman who said he was haunted by terrys 
plight 
he implored the radical moslem shiites holding anderson and 
seven other americans to reclaim your place in civilization by 
releasing the hostages no god would sanction such an act he 
said 
anderson the chief middle east correspondent of the associated 
press has spent 1686 days in captivity the longest of any 
american hostage andersons father and and brother have died and 
his daughter was born since his imprisonment 
former hostages who spent time with anderson said he gained 
strength from his roman catholicism he prayed often and made 
rosary beads from fibers on a mat 
peggy say andersons sister and a staunch campaigner for his 
freedom since he was seized march 16 1985 said the theme of hope 
was appropriate because it sustains both the hostages and those 
living without their loved ones 
despite years of crushed expectations false signs and broken 
dreams who among us is not ready to believe that today could be 
the day our miracle happens mrs say said 
calling for warring factions in the middle east to find peace 
mrs say said it is my deepest hope that our hostages will not 
have suffered so much for so long in vain and for nothing 
after the ceremony mrs say accompanied by the wives of 
hostages robert polhill frank reed and alann steen all from 
beirut met with state department officials to find out what the 
bush administration is doing to free the hostages 
department spokesman richard boucher called for the release of 
the hostages 
our hearts and our thoughts are with the families of these 
innocent victims still held hostage in lebanon all hostages should 
be immediately released and returned to their families as quickly 
as possible he said 
nothing can be gained by the taking and holding of hostages 
he said we will not rest until all of our fellow citizens 
illegally imprisoned in lebanon are free 
the three americans who have died in captivity marine lt col 
william higgins william buckley and peter kilborn deserve a 
special honor he said 
generally administration officials have tried to play down the 
hostage issue in an effort to avoid the kind of scandal that 
tainted the reagan administration in the irancontra affair 
despite a ban on weapons sales president reagan sold arms to 
iran in an unsuccessful attempt to free the hostages reagans 
aides diverted the proceeds of the weapons sales to the nicaraguan 
contras 
meantime sen charles grassley riowa said that he has asked 
two congressional committees to investigate whether the reagan 
administration ignored leads about the hostages in the years 
19861988 
i studied three separate cases and watched them as they 
developed in which the government when either presented with hard 
and reliable information or with overtures from credible sources 
said not only no but heck no grassley said in a speech on the 
senate floor 
grassley refused to discuss specifics but he said he found it 
frustrating to learn that information about the hostages in 
lebanon was being ignored 
at the anderson ceremony benjamin c bradlee executive editor 
of the washington post said all journalists feel an outrage at 
andersons captivity it is way past the time for the cruel and 
unusual treatment of terry anderson to end he said 
others at the ceremony were former diplomat bruce laingen once 
a hostage in iran and journalists walter r mears vice president 
of the ap jonathan wolman ap washington bureau chief peter s 
prichard editor of usa today peter arnett a cable news network 
correspondent rw apple deputy washington editor of the new york 
times and david aikman a foreign correspondent for time magazine 
among those attending were representatives of the embassies of 
lebanon algeria and syria and state department officials 
including john mccarthy the ambassador to lebanon the united 
states has evacuated all americans from the embassy because of 
fighting in lebanon 
the ceremony was organized by no greater love a humanitarian 
organization which promotes peace and helps victims of war it was 
the 20th such event organized on andersons behalf

after having seen her husband and baby murdered right beside 
her said alan patterson spokesman for the british army of the 
rhine in moenchengladbach 
the familys car was riddled with gunfire 
in a statement issued in dublin capital of the irish republic 
the ira said one of our active service units was responsible for 
the gun attack on a member of the british forces in wildenrath 
west germany which resulted in two deaths 
we profoundly regret the death of the infant of the raf 
officer and are certain that our volunteers were not aware of the 
childs presence when they opened fire 
we repeat that there would be no necessity for ira attacks in 
west germany or anywhere else were it not for the british presence 
in the north of ireland 
the ira seeks to drive the british out of northern ireland and 
unite the province with the irish republic 
the attack was the ninth shooting or bombing blamed on the ira 
in west germany since june four people have been killed and 21 
injured 
we cannot let ourselves be intimidated by people who shoot 
babies patterson said we will continue with our duties here 
chancellor helmut kohls spokesman hans klein said the federal 
government was indignant and filled with consternation over the

its just like any accident report 
except multiply it geometrically said one california highway 
patrol official 
investigators have set up a hot line to hear from people who 
were on or near interstate 880 when the doubledecked highway 
collapsed in last weeks earthquake 
initial reports already are helping explain just what happened 
and how some motorists managed to escape the disaster that claimed 
at least 39 lives highway patrol spokesman sam haynes said friday 
the reports also are expected to reveal new tales of bravery as 
well as bust a few stories of heroism 
take the widely reported story of a heroic mayflower 
movingtruck driver who stopped his truck and flagged motorists off 
the stilltrembling highway and onto an exit 
the reality was a little different but interesting in 
itself haynes said 
the truck at the southern edge of the collapsed structure 
slammed into a chunk of concrete forcing another truck behind it 
to jackknife to a halt the two drivers then persuaded other 
motorists behind them to drive down the exit ramp so the 
jackknifed truck could get out haynes said 
but reports persist of another mayflower truck driver who was 
also an emergency medical technician and stayed on the structure to 
help stricken motorists now thats hero material but haynes said 
they havent heard from that driver 
in fact officials havent heard from many people who were 
involved or almost involved in the highway collapse 
a large number of vehicles on the upper deck were able to 
get off after the initial collapse haynes said were still 
trying to determine where those vehicles are and what happened to 
those people 
the complete report which may be weeks in the making will do 
the same job as more typical accident reports helping assess 
damage and settle insurance claims 
but officials also hope to glean clues about how to survive 
another such collapse 
were wondering what kind of advanced warning did people 
have how long did it take what were the clues that allowed them 
to take evasive action haynes said 
several motorists on the upper deck said they had no sense of 
falling the road surface was twisting and shifting from side to 
side and people found themselves coming to rest without realizing 
the road had dropped about 20 feet 
it was kind of like being in an amusement park ride its so 
violent you cant tell which way youre moving haynes said 
traffic on the lower deck was light and in clusters moving 60 
to 65 mph in the two left lanes 50 to 55 mph in the two right 
lanes he said 
those reports jibe with the findings of relieved rescue crews 
who discovered far fewer cars trapped in the rubble than initially 
feared 
the quake hit at 504 pm but the normal rushhour traffic was 
light most likely because people were already home to watch the 
world series game between the san francisco giants and the oakland 
athletics officials said 
officials who rushed to the scene the night of the quake feared 
the worst resulting in officials estimamtes of 200 to 250 dead and 
scores injured 
we were shooting from the hip alameda county sheriff 
charles plummer told the san francisco chronicle a microphone 
was pushed in our faces every 10 minutes and we responded the best 
we could 
tourism officials groused this week that the inflated reports of 
death and destruction made a bad situation even worse 
but emergency officials responding to the disaster were more 
relieved than upset 
i think our fears were overstated but if we had 
underestimated it we would have been criticized even more said 
david johnson an assistant to oakland mayor lionel wilson to 
have people mobilized and ready to help is far better than being 
undermobilized

disgraced television evangelist jim 
bakker will be moved to the federal medical center here to serve 
out his 45year sentence for fraud and conspiracy officials said 
friday 
bakker who met his wife tammy faye bakker in minnesota will 
be moved from a prison in alabama to the prison in this 
southeastern minnesota city of 60000 center spokesman john chreno 
said 
the bakkers met while they were students at north central bible 
college in minneapolis during the early 1960s mrs bakker grew up 
in international falls on the canadian border 
bakker 49 the founder of the ptl ministry will be on the 
mediumsecurity facilitys work crew but no specific assignment 
has been made chreno said 
his transfer to rochester is permanent although he could be 
transferred again chreno said bakker will serve his sentence as a 
member of the medical centers general population meaning he is 
not being assigned to rochester as a patient for treatment of any 
mental or physical illness he said bakker had a breakdown during 
his trial 
among the criminals at the prison are those convicted of federal 
crimes who need medical or psychiatric care 
lyndon larouche the political extremist and former fringe 
presidential candidate is serving a 15year sentence at the 
facility on mail fraud and conspiracy charges 
bakker was convicted oct 5 on all 24 fraud and conspiracy 
counts he faced and was sentenced in charlotte nc on tuesday 
when he also was fined 500000 he was charged with diverting 37 
million from ptl to his personal use 
his attorney harold bender of charlotte has challenged a 
decision to keep bakker in custody while his appeals are pending a 
bail hearing for bakker was scheduled monday at the 4th us 
circuit court of appeals in richmond va 
if his appeals fail bakker will serve at least 10 years in 
prison before being eligible for parole 
he was taken tuesday night to the mediumsecurity federal 
correctional institution at talladega ala often a first stop for 
federal prisoners chreno said the transfer was likely to occur 
within the next week to 10 days 
unlike most federal prisons the rochester facility concentrates 
security on the perimeter and allows inmates relative freedom 
inside the fences there are no bars on windows and inmates do not 
need passes to move about guards do not carry weapons 
the transfer announcement by federal bureau of prisons director 
j michael quinlan gave no specific reason but said that the 
facilitys level of security meets requirements for bakker

not abducted police said friday 
the woman initially turned up frightened and confused at an 
elementary school more than a month ago she told a teacher through 
sign language that she needed help 
she was taken to a school for the deaf and said her name was 
toby cole and indicated that she was kidnapped from california 
three years ago then moved around the country possibly by people 
with ties to the occult 
but police and fbi officials said in a statement friday that the 
woman has since been identified as margaret louise herget 27 from 
oregon and louisiana 
police now do not believe the woman was abducted said police 
lt michael bouchard he refused to elaborate how officials reached 
that conclusion 
herget has used a halfdozen other names at other times and was 
living with her parents in sandy ore as recently as this past 
summer bouchard said 
the woman moved to louisiana in august and apparently lived 
there by herself he said 
herget whom he described as hearingimpaired but not deaf was 
last seen in metairie la just three days before she turned up in 
portland on sept 18 bouchard said 
bouchard would not comment on statements made earlier this week 
by law enforcement officials who had said their investigation 
involved checking on a possible kidnapping and hinted at the 
involvement with satanism 
bouchard said friday that police were still puzzled by the 
womans appearance in maine she does not face any criminal 
charges he said 
we still dont know how she got here he said 
bouchard declined to say where herget was friday officials said 
that police had been in contact with her parents and that the 
maine human services department was involved in the case

a joyful costa rican president oscar 
arias thanked president bush on friday for the us role in 
restructuring costa ricas foreign debt in ways expected to save 
his country 100 million a year 
arias announced the debt restructuring at an airport welcoming 
ceremony for bush who arrived for a twoday meeting with 
hemispheric leaders 
arias said the agreement would reduce costa ricas 45 billion 
foreign debt by 1 billion the annual cost of paying interest on 
the debt will be reduced from 150 million to 50 million 
this is the best possible gift we can possibly make to the 
future generations of costa ricans arias said 
for our neighbors in north america 1 billion isnt much but 
for us down here in costa rica thats all the money in the 
world he said 
with a population of only 27 million costa rica has had one of 
the highest per capita foreign debts in the world 
arias praised his countrys economic officials who had engaged 
in months of negotiations with international bankers in washington 
and thanked the us government who gave us so much assistance 
within the framework of the brady plan 
the brady plan is the initiative that treasury secretary 
nicholas brady announced last march for helping reduce the crushing 
13 trillion debts of third world nations 
arias said that without the support of bush brady and treasury 
undersecretary david mulford it would be very unlikely that we 
would have been able to give you this wonderful news today news 
which will allow costa rica to develop faster in the years to 
come 
the costa rican pact is the third announced under the brady 
initiative previous agreements have been reached with mexico and 
the philippines 
in washington brady said in a statement that the agreement 
would provide important support for costa ricas economic reform 
program and represents an important step forward in easing 
the debts of developing countries 
the agreement provides funds for repaying part of the costa 
rican debt will come from the international monetary fund the 
world bank and several governments including the united states 
costa rica owed 16 billion to private commercial banks and the 
rest to other governments the imf and other international 
institutions 
fabian barrantes a spokesman for arias said it was the debt to 
commercial banks that was renegotiated the country had owed 325 
million in past due interest payments alone the agreement sharply 
reduces debt service payments over the next several years 
costa rica will buy back much of the bank debt for less than 20 
cents on the dollar and issue bonds paying 625 percent interest 
to clear up other debts

families would be able to buy more expensive 
homes with fhainsured mortgages under legislation approved friday 
by the senate 
but a technical disagreement with the house over how much 
mortgage insurance the government can write in fiscal 1990 is 
delaying final congressional action on the measure 
on an 846 vote the senate passed a fiscal 1990 spending bill 
that includes raising the lending lid on the governments primary 
home mortgage insurance program from 101250 to 124875 in 
highcost housing markets 
the house approved the same senateoriginated fha measure on 
wednesday as part of a 67 billion package of government spending 
on housing veterans space science and the environment for the 
current fiscal year that began oct 1 
voting against the overall bill friday were sens william 
armstrong rcolo alan j dixon dill jesse helms rnc 
gordon humphrey rnh steve symms ridaho and william v roth 
rdel 
the senate however refused to accept a house amendment capping 
at 573 billion the amount of new home mortages that the federal 
housing administration can insure in fiscal 1990 
instead the senate insisted on its cap of 75 billion the 
action sends the legislation back to a conference with the house 
fhabacked mortgages that guarantee lenders against losses if 
buyers default are now a source of financing for nearly 900000 
home purchases a year 
the new higher 124875 ceiling on fhainsured mortgages would 
allow the financing of up to an additional 100000 homes a year in 
highcost real estate markets particularly california and the 
northeast according to the mortgage bankers association 
the only other dispute over the bill was over a provision 
inserted by house and senate negotiators nearly doubling nasas 
construction budget above what was voted earlier by lawmakers 
the increase will allow nasa to begin work next year on a 
halfbilliondollar plant for building new advanced solid rocket 
engines for the space shuttle 
negotiators agreed to spend 90 million this year on the plant 
which is to be built in the home district of rep jamie l whitten 
dmiss and another 90 million on research and development of the 
new engines 
the bush administration and the house had sought no money for 
the new rocket engine plant at yellow creek miss and the senate 
had approved only 10 million 
im sure this is not a first but i have never seen anything 
quite like this said sen dale bumpers dark ive seen a 
little mickeying around here and mickeying around there but it 
never occurred to me that conferees had that kind of latitude 
bumpers however did not try to strike the yellow creek 
project saying that arkansas and mississippi are neighbors and 
share the distinction of being poor states in need of just that 
type of federal spending 
the bill provides a total of 124 billion for nasa 17 
billion more than last years level but 900000 less than what the 
administration sought of the total 18 billion will go to 
development of the planned space station 
it also makes available 56 billion for the environmental 
protection agency a 400 million boost over 1989 the superfund 
hazardous waste cleanup program would get 15 billion and 
antipollution efforts would get 817 million 
veterans medical care would get 114 billion 551 million more 
than last year and spending on housing program will rise 23 
billion over the 1989 level of 151 billion

police pulled playwright vaclav 
havel from his sickbed and arrested other dissidents to try to 
stifle a rally set for saturday the anniversary of democratic 
czechoslovakias founding in 1918 
in a speech to about 250 czechoslovaks at the us embassy 
ambassador shirley temple black made a veiled call for more freedom 
in this communist nation which has resisted the tide of reform 
spreading through eastern europe 
havel whose works are banned in czechoslovakia was taken from 
his home to a police station thursday night then hospitalized with 
a bronchial ailment 
on friday police rounded up more dissidents a common practice 
before banned profreedom rallies at least 11 have been detained 
since tuesday 
activists said those detained included john bok and a leading 
dissident in brno jaroslav sabata ludvik vaculik a banned writer 
and founding member of the charter 77 human rights group said 
police warned him and others to get out of prague on saturday 
czechoslovaks gathered in the embassy compound to hear mrs 
black honor tomas garrigue masaryk the nations founding president 
masaryk a czech and the slovak hero gen milan stefanik had 
the support of president woodrow wilson in realizing their dream of 
an independent czechoslovakia on oct 28 1918 
plaques depicting the three men hang on a wall just inside the 
large doors of the ornate embassy building in prague and a few 
hundred czechoslovaks gather there every year 
these three men were patriots mrs temple black told the 
crowd friday they helped free czechs and slovaks from 300 years 
of bondage to an autocratic government 
let us always remember their faith that political unity and 
individual freedom could lead to the new state of czechoslovakia 
and a more prosperous and happy existence for every one of its 
citizens 
after the speech several people adorned the plaques with 
flowers and ribbons of red white and blue then the crowd sang an 
anthem and dispersed one of those present was masaryks 
granddaughter anna 
two hours earlier officials of the national front the 
communistdominated umbrella organization for czechoslovak social 
groups laid wreaths at masaryks grave in lany a village 30 miles 
from prague 
the ceremony reflected a changing official attitude toward 
masaryk once depicted in textbooks as a bourgeois capitalist last 
year the communist authorities declared oct 28 a national holiday 
an official military ceremony has been scheduled for wenceslas 
square pragues central plaza hours before the banned saturday 
rally is to be held there authorities have said those attending 
the rally may be subject to prosecution 
riot police dispersed a peaceful gathering of 5000 in the 
square last year and arrested at least 87 people 
in washington state department spokesman richard boucher said 
there had been a sharp rise in human rights violations in weeks 
leading up to the anniversary celebration 
we expect the czechoslovak government to respect the right of 
its people to assemble for commemorations of this years 
anniversary the right to assemble is a basic human right he 
said 
boucher also said the recent crackdown calls into question the 
seriousness of czechoslovak authorities commitment to 
international agreements as well as their stated interest in 
improving usczechoslovak relations

mikhail s gorbachev visited finlands 
version of the silicon valley on friday and told his hosts he wants 
to build similar hightech research facilities in the soviet union 
we have done good work here gorbachev said before boarding 
his plane at the end of a threeday state visit during which he 
announced a plan to decommission four older model submarines of the 
soviet nucleararmed fleet in the baltic sea 
us defense secretary dick cheney dismissed the gesture as 
insignificant 
speaking in bonn west germany cheney said the soviet nuclear 
capability in the baltic frankly wasnt all that great experts 
have described the four golf iiclass soviet subs as dated and 
virtually useless 
the proposal also received a lukewarm reaction from neighboring 
sweden which supports a ban on nuclear weapons in northern europe 
gorbachevs proposal was interesting but should be studied 
closely before drawing conclusions said sten andersson foreign 
minister of the neutral nation 
swedish opposition leader carl bildt said the golf iiclass 
vessels were the oldest rustiest and most scraggly subs in the 
world 
gorbachev departed for home friday after a fourhour tour of 
oulu a remote baltic sea city of 100000 people about 400 miles 
north of helsinki 
thousands of finns lined the streets to cheer and applaud the 
soviet president who visibly reveled in the attention 
what a lot of people raisa gorbachev said of the crowd 
which was larger than any that greeted the couple in helsinki 
during the first two days of the visit 
gorbachev waved shook hands with residents and clasped his 
hands above his head in victory 
the kremlin leader who has admitted his strategy to restructure 
the economy is in trouble visited a technological village where 80 
sciencebased companies work on the latest advances in computer 
hardware laser equipment and telecommunications 
gorbachev viewed an exhibit by about 30 companies displaying 
curiosity and knowledge in the application of some of the wares 
said pertti huuskonen the director of the village 
huuskonen described the village to gorbachev as finlands 
version of silicon valley a center of hightechnology activities 
in california he quoted the soviet leader as saying he wanted the 
finns to help set up similar projects in his country 
gorbachev was presented with an electronic pulse monitor used by 
athletes and even racehorses that was invented at the technology 
village associated with the 8500student oulu university many 
joggers in finland dont go out without it huuskonen said 
soviet businessmen operating in finland have said they have 
access to technology that is denied them in the soviet union by 
western export limitations 
in bonn cheney said he supports retention of the limits on 
technology transfers because he said the soviet arms capability 
remains a danger to the west

a federal judge dismissed bankruptcy 
proceedings brought by the government against three organizations 
associated with political extremist lyndon h larouche 
judge martin vb bostetter jr in us bankruptcy court ruled 
that the government had acted in bad faith in filing the 
involuntary bankruptcy petitions against caucus distributors inc 
campaigner publications inc and fusion energy foundation inc 
in a separate criminal trial larouche was convicted on dec 16 
1988 of conspiracy to commit mail fraud involving more than 30 
million in defaulted loans 11 counts of actual mail fraud 
involving 294000 and one count of conspiring to defraud the 
internal revenue service he is now serving a 15year prison term 
david r kuney a defense attorney for the laroucheassociated 
organizations said friday about the bankruptcy court decision i 
think its a very important decision because its probably the 
first major victory that these folks have had in their dealings 
with the government 
it reflects that the government simply mishandled the filing 
of the bankruptcy petitions and was overzealous and shouldnt 
have done it kuney said 
david schiller the federal prosecutor who handled the 
bankruptcy case was in court friday afternoon and could not be 
reached immediately for comment 
in his ruling handed down on wednesday judge bostetter said 
that an evaluation of the governments filing on an objective 
level leads this court to conclude that the alleged debtors have 
established that the government filed the petition in bad faith 
it is not the filing of an involuntary petition by the united 
states that constitutes bad faith but the failure to comply 
with the applicable provisions of the legal code that compels 
this conclusion he wrote 
bostetter found that the government was not entitled to bring 
the bankruptcy proceedings against caucus distributors inc and 
fusion energy foundation inc because they are not commercial 
enterprises but notforprofit entities 
he said those groups strived more to expose the world to 
their political viewpoint than attain private monetary gain 
while the government has alleged that their methods of 
fundraising were reprehensible that alone does not change the 
debtors status and provide the appropriate basis for the 
invocation of this courts jurisdiction the judge said

the salvadoran army deserter 
who told us officials in washington about deathsquad 
assassinations took the initiative in the killings according to 
testimony of his former comrades obtained friday 
the testimony was given in recent weeks to judge miguel flores 
figueroa of quetzaltepeque 12 miles north of san salvador it was 
in that region that two suspected leftwing guerrillas lucio 
parada and hector miranda were killed in july after being captured 
by an army unit that included cesar vielman joya martinez 
joya who deserted from the san salvadorbased 1st army brigade 
in july met friday in washington with members of congress he told 
washington journalists thursday that he had been part of a death 
squad responsible for killing as many as 72 suspected leftists he 
has been charged with the deaths of parada and miranda and fled el 
salvador 
the government and armed forces deny the existence of military 
death squads 
col francisco elena fuentes 1st brigade commander called joya 
a deserter a murderer and a liar 
joya 28 told the reporters my work was only to execute 
these people my job was to kill or be killed i realize i was 
manipulated 
he also said some of the people he killed were almost dead 
from being beaten during interrogation 
but some of joyas former comrades told judge flores figueroa 
that joya was the most zealous of torturers who beat drowned or 
suffocated prisoners 
joya has been charged in absentia with premeditated murder in 
the deaths of parada and miranda cpl alcides gomez in the patrol 
that included joya also is charged in the slaying of the two men 
gomez is under arrest 
though joya said he did not know the identities of the men he 
killed his former comrades told the judge that joya was an 
intelligence agent responsible for the capture of specific rebel 
suspects he knew by name 
lt herbert soriano commanded the atlacatl battalion company 
operating north of the capital when parada and miranda were beaten 
or shot to death the two were among eight guerrilla suspects 
captured during an operation around the village of tres ceibas 
according to the testimony of soldiers who took part in the 
operation all eight prisoners were beaten and several were nearly 
drowned by joya over two days of interrogation in the field 
both cpl gomez and another atlacatl soldier eugenio mendez 
testified soriano had given explicit instructions that prisoners 
were not to be tortured gomez said he told joya not to torture the 
prisoners but joya replied if i dont they wont tell us 
anything 
gomez and mendez said soriano was not present when parada and 
miranda were killed they said that after the deaths soriano told 
joya youre in big trouble 
gomez told the judge that after the first man died of the 
beating he expressed concern to joya about problems with the army 
he claimed joya told him dont worry im going to kill them 
all 
in his testimony soriano said two 1st brigade soldiers joya 
and humberto rodriguez were attached to but working 
independently of his atlacatl company 
soriano said a squad from his company accompanied joya and 
rodriguez in making the arrests at tres ceibas he said the squads 
only mission was to give security to the two 1st brigade soldiers 
so they could perform their intelligencegathering duty 
an estimated 70000 people have killed in the 10yearold war 
between leftist rebels and usbacked governments most of the 
victims were civilians rightist death squads allegedly sponsored 
or tolerated by the military have been accused by human rights 
groups of killing more than 20000 suspected leftists in the early 
1980s 
the number of slayings attributed to death squads declined 
between 1984 and 1987 but began to increase last year

us defense secretary dick cheney 
said friday a kremlin pledge to remove nucleararmed submarines 
from the baltic had little significance because soviet nuclear 
strength there isnt all that great 
president mikhail s gorbachev of the soviet union announced 
thursday during a visit to finland that subs carrying 
nucleartipped ballistic missiles would be withdrawn by 1991 and 
the rockets destroyed 
cheney and gerhard stoltenberg west germanys defense minister 
spoke to reporters after talks thursday night and friday on how 
nato defenses should adapt to changing eastwest relations 
the us secretary is on a threeweek tour of europe to meet 
allied leaders and visit us troops he said the announced plan to 
withdraw six aging golfclass subs as a step toward eliminating 
nuclear weapons from the baltic had no relevance for nato which 
wants to keep a nuclear option 
the notion of nuclearfree zones i dont find all that 
significant cheney said the fact of the matter is that 
nuclear weapons continue to be an important part of the successful 
strategy of deterrence a strategy that has worked now for over 40 
years 
he said soviet nuclear capability in the baltic frankly wasnt 
all that great 
cheney said he supports continued limits on technology transfers 
to the soviet union he said the soviets still deploy nuclear 
weapons and the west should not provide them with technical 
knowhow 
as defense minister it is important for me to remind people 
that the soviet union still possesses in fact its the only nation 
in the world that possesses the military capability to destroy us 
and our allies he said 
he and stoltenberg who also met with chancellor helmut kohl 
confirmed the agenda included lowlevel flying maneuvers over west 
germany sharing of defense costs and burdens and the postponed 
modernization of shortrange nuclear missiles stationed in west 
germany 
they gave a display of unity for reporters and stoltenberg said 
nato has made clear a europe devoid of nuclear weapons is not our 
aim 
west germany bucked western alliance policy last spring when 
kohl called for superpower negotiations on reducing shortrange 
nuclear missiles nato has delayed a decision on modernizing the 
weapons until at least 1992 
stoltenberg suggested the missile question was not a major issue 
in the talks because the decision on whether to modernize will 
depend on the military situation three years from now 
kohls government faced with growing public opposition to the 
presence of us missiles on west german territory is hoping an 
eastwest agreement on reducing conventional arms can be reached 
before nato takes up the issue again 
during the exchange with journalists cheney reiterated us 
plans to remove chemical weapons from west germany beginning next 
year 
we have made a commitment to move those chemical weapons 
stockpiles as rapidly as possible he said 
kohl and former president reagan agreed in 1986 that all us 
chemical weapons would be out of west germany by 1992 and that the 
removal would begin in 1990

an arabamerican organization said friday it 
will boycott and picket outlets of a national novelty company it 
says reneged on a decision to recall two halloween masks the group 
finds offensive 
the american arab antidiscrimination committee said its members 
will demonstrate this weekend at outlets of spencer gifts inc 
because the company said friday it had decided to put back on the 
market its sheik and arafat halloween masks 
ronald mangel spencers general counsel said in a letter to 
faris bouhafa aaadc spokesman that john hacala spencers 
president after rereviewing the sheik and arafat masks and 
discussing the look of the masks with others has decided to put 
the masks back on sale today 
his letter added we will not reorder the masks for next 
year 
the pleasantville njbased company had earlier this month 
withdrawn the masks for sale at its 435 outlets after a threeday 
protest and telephone campaign by the committee 
spencer gifts is engaging in what we feel is a grotesque 
deception said bouhafa 
mangel defended the masks thursday saying the essence of 
halloween is exaggeration 
its not an ethnic mask its a character mask he said 
the masks depict a hooknosed arab wearing a kefiyah the 
checkered black and white headdress worn by palestine liberation 
organization leader yasser arafat 
in its halloween catalog spencer had urged customers to put 
on our arafat mask and terrorize your friends 
the arab group characterized the advertisement as an 
exhortation that reinforces the negative and increasingly 
discredited stereotypical image of palestinians as terrorists 
we will use this mask as one of the most glaring examples of 
racism against arab people for years to come said bouhafa 
the committee is a 23000member organization with 63 chapters 
nationwide and is dedicated to the promotion of civil and legal 
rights for people of arab descent

a palestinian suspected of killing seven 
israelis in tel aviv worked as an informant for the secret shin bet 
security service newspapers reported friday 
the leftwing alhamishmar daily said mohammed bin ahmed halebi 
32 of the gaza strips jabaliya refugee camp agreed to work for 
the shin bet in 1985 after serving five years of an 11year 
sentence on charges including drug dealing and prostitution 
almost two weeks ago authorities accused him of strangling seven 
israelis five women and two men with a nylon rope in what police 
said was a criminal dispute despite a massive manhunt halebi has 
eluded capture 
the independent yediot ahronot daily said underground 
palestinian popular committees sentenced him to death for 
collaboration after reports of his cooperation with the shin bet 
were published 
but it was unclear from the reports what information halebi 
provided for the shin bet and whether he had informed on gaza strip 
uprising activists 
at least 136 palestinians have been killed by fellow arabs as 
suspected collaborators during the 22monthold uprising against 
israeli rule of the occupied lands 
alhamishmar said halebi was given a special shin bet 
identification card that allowed him to live in israel after his 
release from prison 
the card also allows free passage through military checkpoints 
they usually are issued only to collaborators who possess special 
information and need refuge in israel to escape death threats from 
palestinian nationalists the independent maariv daily reported 
gaza arabs are banned from staying overnight in israel and must 
have a magnetic card issued by the military administration to pass 
through army checkpoints and enter israel those cards are only 
granted to arabs who pass security checks and have paid taxes 
maariv said hundreds of collaborators have been issued the 
magnetic cards so they can travel freely in israel but that only a 
small number of palestinians have been granted cards by the shin 
bet 
halebi worked with the shin bet and spent most of his time in 
tel aviv where he apparently became involved in drug dealing 
yediot reported 
the stranglings sparked outrage in israel and led several 
rightwing politicians to demand tighter restrictions on the travel 
of palestinians in israel 
the shin bet is responsible for internal security and there 
have been repeated allegations that the service uses petty 
criminals as informers in the occupied territories 
deputy inspector avi dotan said in an interview with israel 
televison that it was not unknown for arabs with criminal pasts 
to work for the police or other security services

the energy department may be moving too 
quickly to restart nuclear reactors that produce material for 
nuclear warheads and reactor managers may not be emphasizing safety 
enough advisers told energy secretary james d watkins on friday 
in a letter to watkins members of the advisory committee on 
nuclear facility safety said that while prospects for a safe 
resumption of production at the savannah river installation in 
south carolina had improved recently they were concerned that 
reactor operators were not being trained in reactor 
fundamentals like commercial reactor operators 
the operators are employed by westinghouse corp which runs 
savannah river under contract the letter did not detail what the 
advisers meant by reactor fundamentals 
the reactors produce tritium a gas and are similar in basic 
design to most civilian power reactors though they operate at much 
lower temperatures and pressures 
that this omission will remain through restart may belie 
westinghouses claim that safety is their primary concern and that 
early restart of the reactors is not the driving factor in 
training the letter said 
the three savannah river reactors built for the government in 
the early 1950s were shut down more than 1 years ago because of 
mechanical problems and safety concerns 
watkins said in september that he hoped to restart the first 
reactor by late next summer although he has stressed that 
unforeseen problems could change the schedule 
the advisers told watkins that while restart planning was 
generally good the absence of operator training in reactor 
fundamentals was a serious problem 
the advisers also said training of energy department personnel 
at the site is not keeping pace with the contractors training of 
its operational personnel 
in addition the committee members said watkins may be biting 
off more than he can chew in trying to get all three idled reactors 
back in operation within a sixmonth period starting next summer or 
fall they said it might be wiser to concentrate the best talent on 
restarting one reactor then moving on to another when the first is 
running smoothly 
restarting all three reactors in the sixmonth period will 
certainly require a large number of welltrained competent people 
who may not be available they wrote 
the advisers praised watkins efforts to clarify lines of 
authority from the department headquarters to savannah river and 
said other needed management changes were under way 
even so the committee members expressed concern that while top 
westinghouse managers had gotten the message about the need for 
greater attention to safety the new safety philosophy may not 
have reached middle management and below 
procedural errors and reporting problems continue and indicate 
that an emphasis on safety of operations is not yet pervasive 
the letter said

the soviet legislature is drafting war powers 
legislation to prevent another afghanstyle invasion the speaker 
of that parliament told an american audience friday 
i can tell you quite strongly that at present there would be 
no repeat of what happened when our troops were sent into 
afghanistan the speaker yevgeny m primakov said at the 
brookings institution a liberal washington think tank the red 
army ended its 10year afghan intervention last february 
primakov said the supreme soviet legislature was wresting power 
from the soviet executive branch but played little role in the 
decision this week to declare that a siberian radar violated a 
superpower treaty 
the meeting was crowded with senior analysts from the central 
intelligence agency scholars and journalists all eager to hear the 
comments of primakov who in september was named a nonvoting 
member of the communist party politburo previously he headed the 
largest soviet think tank the institute for world economy and 
international relations imemo 
in a wideranging discussion primakov said 
the soviets are not opposed to the eventual reunification of 
germany if the people of west and east germany make that choice 
but that neither the capitalist nor the communist state should 
consume the other primakovs remarks however clearly 
reflected skepticism about the benefits to europe of reunification 
which he called a matter for the future 
that communist party leaders reserved the right to fire or 
criticize editors or journalists as exercised last week by soviet 
president mikhail s gorbachev 
that despite an acute shortage of consumer goods the 
government would continue its compromise course of economic 
restructuring neither retreating to a fully centralized system nor 
seeking quick introduction of a free market 
the soviet union wants to join international economic 
activities such as the international monetary fund and the general 
agreement on trade and tariffs 
primakov was asked how the supreme soviet solved the dilemma 
posed by the us war powers act which allows the president to 
send troops to a war zone but requires congressional approval to 
leave them there 
we are drafting a mechanism for making a decision of that 
kind but so far it is not in place primakov said but i can 
be quite firm in saying that there can be no decision of that sort 
without involvement from the supreme soviet 
there can be no repetition of the situation when a small group 
of leaders makes a decision that is not made in accord with the 
legislative branch he said 
as an example of government consultation with the supreme 
soviet primakov cited a speech by foreign minister eduard a 
shevardnadze this week shevardnadze said that intervening in 
afghanistan was a mistake and that a radar station in krasnoyarsk 
siberia had been built in knowledge it violated the 1972 
antiballistic missile treaty 
asked whether the decision to destroy the radar had been made by 
the ruling communist party politburo or by the legislature 
primakov said 
as to this latest decision to dismantle the krasnoyarsk radar 
we can only be happy that a decision was taken to dismantle 
it 
pressed to say who made the decision primakov said there is 
a separation of powers in this country congress just approves 
overall military expenditure not single individual projects that 
is my answer to your question 
primakov has risen to power at the head of a newly reconstituted 
soviet legislature whose members were elected this year in the 
most competitive balloting in the soviet union since the bolshevik 
revolution of 1917 
his delegation is visiting washington at the invitation of 
congressional leaders in part to study the operation of congress 
on thursday primakov met with president bush and secretary of 
state james a baker iii and was introduced on the floor of the 
senate by his hosts senate majority leader george mitchell 
dmaine and senate minority leader bob dole rkan 
after two days of meetings in washington the group was headed 
for maine kansas los angeles pittsburgh and new york

the security council on friday called on 
iran and iraq to work constructively with a un envoy to be 
sent to the region in an effort to break the deadlock in peace 
talks 
secretarygeneral javier perez de cuellar will send his special 
envoy swedish ambassador jan k eliasson to begin shuttle talks 
between baghdad and tehran on monday 
he is not taking specific proposals but he will be listening 
to all parties concerned who will be available to him perez de 
cuellar told reporters nothing is spectacularly new 
eliassons mission is expected to last two or three weeks he 
said 
the 15 council members expressed impatience with the pace of the 
iraniraq talks 
their statement said in part members of the council noted 
that over two years have elapsed since security council resolution 
598 was adopted and that more than 14 months have gone by since the 
ceasefire went into effect with the concurrence of both sides 
resolution 598 calls for a ceasefire the withdrawal of troops 
to their own countries an exchange of prisoners of war and a 
negotiated peace settlement it would establish a panel to 
apportion blame for the war that began in september 1980 
the iraniraq peace talks opened in geneva in august 1988 but 
quickly bogged down a truce prevails along the 350mile war front 
supervised by teams of the un iraniraq military observer group 
it is estimated that about 100000 prisoners are still being 
held in pow camps in iran and iraq 
iran insists the next step in the peace process must be the 
withdrawal of troops iraqi forces still occupy about 385 square 
miles of iranian territory 
also on friday diplomats said iran has stopped flooding a 
nomans land in the southern front near the iraqi city of 
basra iran made no comment 
iran began flooding the area in iranian territory northeast of 
basra in september 1988 just after the ceasefire took effect 
a large canal was opened turning the marshy region into 
swampland making it impassable to armored vehicles 
last year perez de cuellar called it a serious violation of the 
ceasefire and reported the flooding covered an area 37 miles long 
and about 2 miles wide 
iraq and un officials registered complaints over the flooding 
but iran which claims it is an internal matter did not respond

libyan leader moammar gadhafi who recently declared 
he had given up supporting terrorism said friday he will continue 
to back liberation movements 
gadhafi told a magazine during a visit to egypt this week that 
libya once aided terrorist groups but halted such support when we 
discovered these groups were causing more harm than benefit to the 
arab cause 
in an interview friday night with the italian state network rai 
gadhafi was told italians appreciated the remarks on terrorism 
yes certainly said the libyan leader 
but when pressed further on the issue gadhafi said libya 
continues to make a distinction between terrorism and liberation 
movements which he said he will continue to support 
he did not elaborate in the past gadhafi has described such 
groups as the irish republican army as liberation movements 
rather than terrorists 
the us state department said thursday that gadhafi was still 
supplying funds weapons safe havens and training facilities to 
such groups as the japanese red army the ira and the popular front 
for the liberation of palestinegeneral command 
in addition the state department said the palestinian group 
fatah revolutionary council led by abu nidal still had headquarters 
in tripoli the libyan capital

the army is grounding most of its ch47d 
chinook transport helicopters again because of a new problem with 
transmission oil cooling fans the army announced friday evening 
only eight days earlier the helicopters affected 211 of the 
264 in the fleet had been cleared to fly after another fan 
problem was fixed 
the fleet was grounded in august as a precaution while fan 
failures were studied 
the armys aviation systems command and the manufacturer boeing 
helicopter co determined that vibration most probably was causing 
the fans to fail the 211 machines that had not had failures were 
given the green light to fly again on oct 19 provided that 
modifications had been made while studies continued on the 53 
whose fans had failed 
during inspection of the first craft to be modified however a 
new problem was found in the lubrication of the fan shaft spline 
said the army statement 
the st louisbased aviation systems command and the 
manufacturer are now working on the lubrication problem in the 211 
newly grounded helicopters and will check the 53 that had not been 
cleared to fly the army said

the radarevading topsecret stealth fighter 
will be shown to the public fairly soon said a top air force 
official on friday 
gen larry d welch the air force chief of staff also said his 
service arm will continue to modernize its fleet to respond to a 
soviet military capability undiminished by recent political changes 
in moscow 
the defense department will decide shortly when to declassify 
the f117a stealth fighter welch said although the plane has been 
flying for eight years only two official pictures have been 
released one of them a drawing 
certainly at some point youll have an opportunity to come and 
take a closer look at it i would think fairly soon he said 
based at the tonopah test range airfield in nevada the jets are 
carefully screened from public view at least 52 f117as have been 
delivered 
welch insisted the existing fighter and bomber fleet could not 
be upgraded to stealth capability to counter increasingly 
sophisticated soviet air defenses 
welch spoke to reporters before addressing a meeting of the air 
force association 
the batwinged b2 stealth bomber which was displayed to the 
public in its maiden flight in july and its fighter counterpart 
the f117a use sophisticated antiradar technology 
welch said he was optimistic the b2 stealth bomber built by 
northrop corp will be deployed despite congressional objections 
to the estimated 705 billion it will cost to build a projected 
fleet of 132 aircraft 
i think theres no question that the b2 program will go 
welch said the issue is what will be the pace over the next two 
years 
he acknowledged political and budget considerations left open 
how many bombers ultimately will be built 
for any one of us to try and predict at this point in time how 
were going to feel about the size of the bomber force four or five 
years from now is kind of a futile exercise he said

the soviet union supports the czechoslovak 
leaders who insist that the warsaw pact invasion of czechoslovakia 
in 1968 was proper soviet foreign minister eduard shevardnadze 
said friday 
we may only change our appraisal of those developments from 
the present day perspective by a joint decision with 
czechoslovaia he said it is a very complicated delicate and 
difficult problem 
shevardnadze made the comments in an intervicew with adam 
michnik an editor of the prosolidarity newspaper gazeta wyborcza 
michnik is a solidarity deputy in the legislature and a former 
political prisoner 
he helped draft a resolution adopted by the polish parliament 
this august that condemned the invasion of czechoslovakia by 
members of the sovietled warsaw pact military alliance 
czechoslovakias hardline communist party leadership is 
resisting reforms being pursued in poland hungary and the soviet 
union and opposes any revision of its stand that the invasion was 
necessary 
all of the warsaw pack members except romania sent forces that 
invaded czechoslovakia aug 21 1968 ousted the liberal communist 
party government led by alexander dubcek and established a new 
administration firmly within sovietbloc control 
soviet president mikhail s gorbachevs program of perestroika 
or restructuring has been compared to the 1968 reforms in 
czechoslovakia but soviet leaders have never said the invasion was 
a mistake 
shevardnadze told michnik i deem it inadmissible for anyone 
to impose his view of that problem the invasion on others we 
regard the appraisal made by the czechoslovak communist party and 
the czechoslovak government as binding 
czechoslovakia is a sovereign state and has an unquestionable 
right to assess its own history independently he added the 
appraisals passed by the czechoslovak leaders then are not 
different from their present ones and we respect them

central africa to enter service with the intelsat network of 13 
satellites 
manufactured by nine international companies under the direction 
of the hughes aircraft co of the united states intelsat vi weighs 
9500 pounds and measures 39 feet by 12 feet 
with 24000 simultaneous twoway telephone circuits and three 
color television channels the satellite will relay telephone

targets of a federal crackdown on marijuana 
growers criticized the searchandseizure tactics of drug agents 
friday but officials defended them as necessary to stem the flow 
of potent pot 
they made one hell of a mess said steve murphy whose 
indoor sun shoppe was one of five seattle stores raided he said 
agents took everything from his store except plants and baskets 
including two computers containing store records such as invoices 
and payroll data 
it seems a little ridiculous to pick on this shop murphy 
said you could start going to all the hardware stores and 
lighting stores or just about any other place we dont carry 
anything that they dont have 
but raymond mckinnon agent in charge of the federal drug 
enforcement administration in seattle defended the raids 
one of the things we were particularly aiming at were the 
business records he said some of these people should be 
concerned 
after two days of raids drug agents around the country had 
arrested 191 people by late friday afternoon and seized 20419 
marijuana plants and 290 pounds of packaged marijuana said a 
federal law enforcement source in washington dc 
they also confiscated 137 indoor marijuana groves and searched 
36 stores believed to sell equipment used in indoor marijuana 
cultivation seizing nine of them 
the agents seized a total of 59 million in assets primarily 
the stores and equipment and some cash said the source who spoke 
on condition of anonymity 
officials said store records would be used for further 
investigation 
in the previous month the investigation codenamed operation 
green merchant resulted in the arrests of 112 people on charges of 
cultivating marijuana at 94 indoor growing locations containing 
17000 plants said dea spokesman frank shults 
the idea of this operation was to reassert to the american 
public the idea of accountability mckinnon said there is no 
area of drug trafficking that is immune to prosecution 
the biggest drug seizure over the last two days was in columbus 
ga where agents discovered 3400 marijuana plants in a barn on a 
farm the washington source said 
georgia bureau of investigation agent john pike said the 
marijuana had an estimated street value of 8 million the farmer 
who is believed to have grown the marijuana was still at large he 
said 
agents also seized 1440 plants at a site in wichita kan and 
600 plants grown by an equipment store owner in san diego the 
source said 
officials said thursday they were targeting about 100 indoor 
marijuana groves in 46 states and 65 stores in 22 states raids 
will continue for as long as it takes the source said 
the point has to be made that anyone dealing drugs in this 
community will be dealt with said mike mckay us attorney for 
western washington 
in north carolina 76 people were charged with possession or 
manufacturing of marijuana 
joseph huberman of raleigh who was not arrested said officers 
searched his house because he had ordered a light meter to help 
cultivate orchids from a mailorder company suspected by the dea 
he said he allowed the agents into his home even though they did 
not have a warrant 
i feel like its not good eroding my civil rights for this 
drug program huberman said it must be a little inconvenient 
for them to have to pay attention to the constitution all the 
time

as heavy equipment growls through the 
rubble of a collapsed oakland freeway that killed dozens in last 
weeks earthquake engineers friday said the freeways achilles 
heel appears more obvious each day 
while many factors contributed to interstate 880s destruction 
engineers say it appears that the bases of some of the vertical 
support columns snapped that allowed the upper lanes to slam down 
on the roadway below two separate engineering teams one from the 
university of california berkeley and the other from uc san diego 
reported 
neither team is ready to discount some of the other theories 
that surfaced in the days following the oct 17 collapse of the 
1mile section of the nimitz freeway 
and they added many factors probably were involved ranging 
from shaky ground to the peculiar way the 32yearold structure may 
have fallen in step with the seismic waves 
but the critical failure on the states oldest doubledecker 
freeway appears to have been at the point where many of the upper 
deck concrete columns attached to the lower deck jack p moehle 
an engineering professor and spokesman for the berkeley team said 
friday 
from the sketches ive seen it makes sense to me said nels 
roselund whose south pasadena engineering firm specializes in 
earthquakeproofing old structures 
the column joints which moehle said met construction standards 
when they were built might have held had they contained more 
reinforcing steel 
but engineers have more computer analysis and other testing to 
perform before they can be certain he and others said 
moehle added friday that despite assertions from state 
department of transportation engineers and others the onceswampy 
filled ground beneath the structure may have played a major role in 
its collapse by amplifying the quake 
we now have readings of ground motion under the freeway of 
an increase of threetenths g acceleration he said in contrast 
acceleration at nearby berkeley was only point zero nine 
moehle said a g is a unit of acceleration equal to the 
acceleration of gravity 
subsurface maps released by the transportion department earlier 
this week show that many of the structures 25 miles of steel 
pilings are in clay and none of them reach bedrock but caltrans 
chief structural engineer jim roberts said his geologists believe 
most pilings found sufficient anchor on a layer of hardpacked sand 
about 250 feet beneath the surface 
moehle criticized suggestions from critics that state engineers 
who oversaw the project 32 years ago should have required more 
steel in columns and that they should have bolstered the columns 
strength since then 
he said the work more than met prevailing construction standards 
of the time and moehle and others expressed doubt that engineers 
today could have anticipated the problems in the column joints 
unfortunately we only learn about earthquakes from 
earthquakes said clayton r giroux the retired state engineer 
who designed the structure 
roberts said that once the structure is razed at a cost of about 
10 million a new freeway eventually will be built at an estimated 
cost of 50 million to 100 million

the supreme court refused friday to 
overturn the ban on allowing ferdinand marcos body to be returned 
to the philippines 
the ruling appeared to close the last legal move to allow the 
former president to be buried in his homeland but a promarcos 
lawyer said he would study the possibility of other legal maneuvers 
to allow marcos widow imelda and their three children to return 
from exile 
mrs aquino praised the court decision 
let us now concentrate on solving the remaining problems of 
our nation and together work for development and economic growth as 
one people bearing one vision for the common good she said 
chief justice marcelo fernan told reporters the court ruled 87 
to reject a petition filed by marcos supporters oct 2 asking that 
his body and his immediate family be allowed to return from hawaii 
where marcos died in exile sept 28 
mrs aquino banned the marcoses citing threats to national 
security marcos was entombed in hawaii oct 15 in what the family 
said was a temporary burial 
the threats to the government to which the return of the 
marcoses has been viewed to provide a catalytic effect have not 
been shown to have ceased the eight justices said in the 
majority opinion 
they cited recent statements by marcos widow imelda that her 
husband remained the legitimate president of the philippines until 
his death 
in the dissenting opinion justice abraham sarmiento said the 
threat allegedly posed by the marcoses is the realm of 
conjecture speculation and imagination 
its very unfortunate that the government missed a very rare 
chance for reconciling our people said rolando abadilla vice 
governor of ilocos norte province and a marcos supporter 
abadilla said marcos fellow northerners were angry at the court 
decision and some of the women were shouting in the tagalog 
language patayin si cory or kill cory 
former solicitor gen estelito mendoza one of the lawyers who 
filed the petition for the marcoses said he will study new legal 
strategies to lift the ban on mrs marcos ferdinand jr and 
daughters irene araneta and imee manotoc 
the decision makes no mention whatsoever of why they are not 
allowed to return to the country mendoza said 
lawyer rafael recto another prominent marcos supporter said it 
was unlikely the ban would be relaxed 
there is no more hope for president marcos and the family of 
president marcos to return here as long as the aquino government is 
here recto said and mrs aquino will never change her mind 
they are afraid of the living and they are also afraid of the 
dead 
the aquino government has accused marcos his wife and hundreds 
of associates of stealing up to 10 billion in public funds 
in october 1988 a us grand jury indicted the marcoses on 
racketeering charges in the alleged embezzlement mrs marcos is to 
stand trial in new york in march 
on tuesday about 200 marcos supporters began a 250mile march 
from ilocos norte province to manila to demand his bodys return 
police said the group had reached la union province 150 miles 
north of manila on friday and chanted cory is afraid of ghosts 
as it marched through towns

prime minister margaret thatcher said friday its 
business as usual with a revamped cabinet after her treasury 
chief quit but critics and commentators called it the biggest 
crisis of her 10 years in power 
many of mrs thatchers staunchest supporters blamed her 
highhanded style of leadership for provoking thursdays 
resignation of chancellor of the exchequer nigel lawson and the 
ensuing run on the pound and sharp drop on the london stock market 
the city hit for billions headlined fridays evening 
standard newspaper saying lawsons resignation had wiped billions 
off share values shaken the pound and raised the threat of another 
interest rate increase 
the main stock exchange index was off 22 percent for the day 
while the pound rebounded slightly from a sharp skid with the 
support of the bank of england and the us federal reserve board 
the independent newspapers report that conservative party 
legislators met secretly to discuss challenging mrs thatchers 
leadership could not be confirmed conservative and opposition 
lawmakers agreed that her authority had been undermined but did not 
believe her job was under immediate threat 
not now net yet said ivor stanbrook a rightwing stalwart 
in the house of commons 
in an interview published in saturdays editions of the daily 
express mrs thatcher was quoted as saying im not going to 
resign im going to win the next election because everything i say 
is in tune with the deep feelings people have 
the newspaper said the prime minister had initiated the 
interview and that it was conducted friday morning 
mrs thatcher told reporters as she left her home friday morning 
that government policies would continue precisely as they were 
despite having new men in charge at the treasury the foreign 
office and the home office 
we have an excellent new team and it will be business as usual 
and we shall go steadily forward she said 
but the headline in the prothatcher daily telegraph blared 
crisis for thatcher and the normally proconservative times of 
london said it was her biggest crisis since taking office in 1979 
the financial times editorialized she had put lawson in an 
impossible situation and might eventually follow him out of office 
lawson resigned because of a clash over currency policy with sir 
alan walters mrs thatchers private economic adviser lawson 
believed in a strong and stable pound walters advocated 
freefloating exchange rates 
lawson also advocated joining the european monetary system 
which walters opposed and mrs thatcher resisted differences over 
european policy were also believed to be at the root of mrs 
thatchers decision three months ago to remove sir geoffrey howe as 
foreign secretary 
according to the british media mrs thatcher would not fire 
walters so lawson resigned then walters resigned a few hours 
after lawson 
mrs thatcher replaced lawson with his former deputy john 
major who had been foreign secretary for just three months home 
secretary douglas hurd a former career diplomat became foreign 
secretary and david waddington the governments chief whip in the 
house of commons replaced hurd 
neil kinnock leader of the opposition labor party blamed the 
affair on the utter incompetence of the prime minister 
labors treasury spokesman john smith asked why didnt she 
get rid of walters before and keep lawson it is something that is 
so staggeringly incompetent and inept 
kenneth baker the conservative party chairman began the 
governments attempts at damage control early friday dismissing 
any suggestion that mrs thatchers position was at risk 
she has been in many difficulties and come through them 
successfully there is not an economic crisis the economy of the 
country remains very strong baker told the bbc 
sir william clark chairman of the conservative partys 
parliamentary finance committee said suggestions of a leadership 
change were pieinthesky 
but michael dobbs former chief of staff at the partys 
headquarters wrote in the evening standard that mrs thatcher has 
only herself to blame 
a challenge to her leadership is far from inevitable but it 
is no longer inconceivable dobbs wrote 
peter jenkins the respected columnist of the independent who 
wrote a book about mrs thatcher in 1987 said that thursday had 
been her most disastrous days work in 10 years 
there is now a smell of decay in the air jenkins wrote

police are recruiting 2000 additional 
officers for the period leading up to independence and former 
rebels and antiinsurgency police are welcome to apply a police 
official said friday 
maj gen piet fouche acting commissioner of the southwest 
african police said the main reasons for the recruitment drive 
were an increase in petty crime and the need to protect political 
candidates prior to the nov 711 preindependence elections 
the united nations is supervising the elections which will end 
south africas 74year rule of namibia 
at the insistence of the united nations the namibian 
administratorgeneral louis pienaar last month ordered that the 
antiguerrilla police unit koevoet be disbanded 
koevoet means crowbar in the afrikaans language the 
1500member force fought the southwest africa peoples 
organization the guerrilla group that for 23 years tried to drive 
south africa from the territory koevoet was accused of atrocities 
in northern namibia 
fouche said former koevoet members as well as swapo guerrillas 
who have returned from exile to vote for a constitutional assembly 
next month are welcome to join the police force applicants with 
prior experience could be deployed within two weeks he said 
he said the recruitment drive was not an attempt to get around 
the un demand that koevoet be disbanded 
swapo leaders have said that after independence soldiers who 
fought on both sides will have to be reintegrated into a new army 
and police force but they also have insisted that koevoet men be 
excluded during the election period 
swapo is expected to win the most votes in the balloting

a government spokesman said friday that 
1087 people have been detained for disruptive activities since 
army commander gen saw maung seized power in september 1988 
western diplomatic sources said the number of political 
prisoners is much higher 
col than tun told a weekly news briefing that the figure of 
1087 detentions since the sept 18 1988 coup did not include 
common criminals 
saw maung has ruled by martial law since the coup 
some rangoonbased western diplomats contacted by telephone 
estimated the government had detained several thousand people since 
it intensified its crackdown on dissidents in july the diplomats 
speaking with the condition of anonymity said they did not have 
specific figures 
a week ago a government spokesman said civilian courts and 
military tribunals had sentenced 100 people to death in the past 
three months for various crimes he said 24 of the defendants were 
convicted by military courts set up to deal with martiallaw 
violations 
the diplomats said burmas leading opposition group the 
national league for democracy has been hardest hit by the 
political suppression 
on july 20 the government put league chairman tin oo and general 
secretary aung san suu kyi under house arrest on charges of 
subversion 
the government allowed the formation of some 200 political 
parties after it announced plans to hold multiparty elections next 
may the first such elections in burma for a quarter of a century 
but the opposition has very little opportunity to talk or to 
organize because of the crackdown on dissent one of the 
diplomats said and many of the parties are not active 
the military junta has said it will not support any party in the 
campaign but the diplomats said it obviously favors the 
promilitary national unity party successor to the burma socialist 
program party that ruled from 196288 
two other groups the league for democracy and peace led by 
former prime minister nu and the union national democracy party 
headed by aung gyi apparently are more free to operate than the 
national league for democracy the diplomats said

the bush administration has shown other 
countries a draft united nations resolution calling for a 
moratorium on the use of high seas drift nets by the summer of 
1992 a state department official said friday 
the text has been circulated to a number of countries and we 
are now in a consultative process in the un said ed wolfe the 
state departments ambassador for oceans and fisheries 
under the proposed resolution the moratorium would take effect 
unless or until it is agreed based on scientific data that the 
unacceptable impact of such practices can be prevented and the 
conservation of the worlds living marine resources can be 
ensured 
thomas pickering us ambassador to the united nations is 
expected to formally introduce the resolution within the next few 
weeks 
the resolution notes that thousands of vessels use drift nets in 
the pacific atlantic and indian oceans and the mediterranean sea 
american fishermen say drift net vessels from japan taiwan and 
south korea have been snaring millions of us salmon in the north 
pacific and that fish runs in the washington state oregon and 
alaska have declined as a result of the illegal harvest 
the fishermen also insist the us tuna catch has fallen as a 
result of drift net fishing in the south pacific 
the smallmesh monofilament nets ostensibly used to catch 
squid snare anything they come in contact with and 
environmentalists have charged they kill thousands of marine 
mammals sea birds and other marine animals annually 
the nets can stretch more than 30 miles in length and on any 
given day can cover more than 30000 miles of ocean 
earlier this year the united states signed bilateral 
enforcement and monitoring agreements with taiwan korea and japan 
and the bush administration has been reluctant to seek an 
international ban on drift nets until those pacts expire next year

jamie fiske whose 1982 liver transplant 
helped shape the nations organ transplant policy is going home in 
time for halloween after recovering from spleen removal surgery a 
hospital spokeswoman said friday 
the 7yearold and her mother marilyn are scheduled to fly 
home saturday to east bridgewater mass said mary stanik 
spokeswoman for the university of minnesota hospital 
she has been just great for two weeks since being readmitted 
to the hospital after suffering internal bleeding stanik said 
jamie was admitted on oct 5 after suffering three bouts of 
internal bleeding within a month doctors removed jamies spleen 
which doctors said was seven or eight times its normal size 
the day after she left the hospital however jamie suffered 
more internal bleeding and was readmitted stanik said jamie has 
had no more bleeding since then 
charles fiske said his daughter often asked if she would be home 
in time for halloween her favorite holiday she plans to dress as 
the queen of hearts 
jamie was born nov 26 1981 with biliary atresia a condition 
in which the livers bile ducts are blocked months later the 
fiskes learned only a liver transplant could save her life 
in 1982 fiske made an emotional appeal for a donor during a 
convention at the american academy of pediatricians a few days 
later a utah family offered to donate the liver of their 
11monthold son who was killed in an accident 
jamies case raised questions about the procedures for determing 
who should receive organ transplants and the properiety of awarding 
organs on the basis of publicity one result was the national 
transplant act which created a national computer system that 
matches donors to recipients

abortion opponents friday dropped 
efforts to put proposed abortion restrictions before the general 
assembly this fall but pledged to renew their efforts in the spring 
ralph rivera chairman of the illinois prolife coalition said 
there appears to be no chance of getting the bill through the house 
rules committee which blocked the measure by a onevote margin 
earlier this month 
as of this time we havent been able to get the 10th vote 
based on the makeup of the committee rivera said 
the decision likely postpones any action on abortion legislation 
until the general assemblys spring session which begins in early 
april 
gary lapaille chief of staff to house speaker michael madigan 
confirmed that the measure would not be scheduled for consideration 
in the rules committee this week the last scheduled week of the 
fall session 
the proposal drafted to mirror missouri restrictions upheld by 
the us supreme court in july would require doctors to determine 
the viability of any fetus believed to be 20 weeks old or older 
before performing an abortion 
it also would require a second physician to be present at the 
abortion of any fetus determined to be viable and would bar public 
employees and public facilities from being involved in abortions 
pam sutherland executive director of planned 
parenthoodillinois said the announcement was a clear signal 
lawmakers had responded to lobbying by abortion rights supporters 
they heard from a lot of people she said 
rivera said antiabortion groups would work to defeat 
abortionrights lawmakers in the statewide primary in march 
were going to be working very strongly to secure more votes 
not just in the committee but the general assembly as a whole 
he said those who havent been with us we are going to have to 
replace if we can 
ms sutherland said prochoice groups are prepared to work 
actively on behalf of their candidates as well 
my reaction is isnt it wonderful that illinois families 
dont have to worry about this this fall but they will later this 
spring she said

ended friday with a guard and three inmates seriously injured five 
hostages freed and much of the overcrowded institution destroyed or 
damaged by fire authorities said

find cells for 960 prisoners from the state correctional 
institution at camp hill which was 45 percent over its capacity at 
2600 inmates according to attorney general ernie preate 
the state prison system as a whole is 48 percent over capacity 
the first 10 buses carrying inmates to other prisons across the 
state left friday night from camp hill in a rural area west of 
harrisburg 
there were no deaths and no escapes officials said more than 
100 people were injured one hospitalized in critical condition in 
the battle to take back the mediumsecurity prison 
it was a lot of waiting but when we do it we do it said 
one state trooper who declined to give his name 
five staff members taken hostage were either released by inmates 
or rescued by police corrections department spokesman ken robinson 
said 
police stormed a kitchen building with guns firing wounding one 
inmate as they began taking back control of the prison friday 
morning after fires spewed eyeburning smoke into the early morning 
darkness officials said the officers also used tear gas 
robinson announced at 935 am that officials were again in 
control of the institution nearly 15 hours after inmates somehow 
freed themselves during a lockdown imposed because of a sevenhour 
riot wednesday 
state police in riot gear and wielding shotguns pushed 
surrendering or captured prisoners to the ground holding them 
facedown in the grass of a prison courtyard 
at one point all inmates were out of all the cellblocks 
robinson said 
the corrections department late in the afternoon said 960 
inmates from camp hill would be moved to five other prisons in the 
state the department said inmates were being sent to the 
graterford mercer pittsburgh smithfield and waymart state 
prisons 
fourteen of 31 buildings were gutted by fire robinson said 
including eight modular housing units 
although officials initally believed eight hostages were taken 
the number turned out to be five robinson said 
none of the hostages suffered lifethreatening injuries 
officials said 
robinson said more than 100 people were injured during the two 
nights they included 34 prison employees 32 inmates and 10 state 
police or firefighters 
an 18yearold inmate was in critical condition with a gunshot 
wound to the upper torso said marianne benjamin a spokeswoman for 
polyclinic medical center in harrisburg 
a 24yearold inmate was listed in serious condition after at 
least three hours of surgery for a smallcaliber gunshot wound to 
the abdomen milton s hershey medical center spokesman steve 
bortner said 
a 41yearold guard who was listed as critical was upgraded to 
serious condition with multiple stab wounds to the back hershey 
spokeswoman marybeth bruchwalski said 
another inmate was in fair condition at harrisburg hospital 
also with a gunshot wound said supervisor gail kraus she said she 
did not have an age 
only four hours before violence broke out a second time 
superintendent robert m freeman had said the first nights 
problems might have been linked to a decision to prohibit families 
from bringing food to inmates during extended visits he also said 
inmates were upset by a change in the way they received medical 
care 
you always expect something like this could happen said 
mattie humphrey a prison volunteer whose son milton is an inmate 
serving 10 to 20 years on a weapons offense i think the change 
in the rule that denied family members to bring prisoners 
homeprepared food was one of the reasons for the rioting 
a state trooper who said he was on duty all night and had been 
inside the prison described the complex as totally trashed 
the cellblocks i was in two cellblocks are completely 
demolished said the trooper who refused to give his name 
shortly after dawn a state police helicopter swooped over the 
prison and a trooper using a loudspeaker urged any inmate who 
wanted to surrender to lie on the ground one inmate was seen 
waving a white bed sheet at a window inside and a short time later 
three more white flags were seen in more windows

secretary of state james a baker iii blocked 
a speech by a senior white house official that gave a pessimistic 
assessment of soviet president mikhail s gorbachevs prospects of 
revamping the soviet economy the white house said friday 
on a flight to costa rica white house press secretary marlin 
fitzwater acknowledged there were various opinions about 
gorbachevs prospects within the bush administration 
but fitzwater said even with opinions all over the lot 
about the future of perestroika the point is we want it to 
endure 
the white house spokesman added thats the presidents 
policy 
the speech had been scheduled by robert m gates the deputy 
national security adviser the new york times gave the first 
account of his muzzling 
fitzwater told reporters aboard air force one as president bush 
headed for a hemisphere summit meeting in san jose its not 
really a question of policy its a question of analysis and 
interpretation of events that the state department felt was better 
left unsaid at this point 
in a san jose news conference baker said there is no division 
of opinion whatsoever about policy 
i suggested the timing was not the very best for gates 
speech he said coming soon after two baker speeches sounding a 
very positive tone toward the soviets and a speech by vice 
president dan quayle that baker said he had been reported as 
harderline than was really the case 
this is strictly a question of timing baker said 
this speech dealt with the durabilty of reforms not the 
desirability of the reforms it did not deal with the policy 
question do we should we want to see perestroika succeed 
quayle in an interview on the cable news network john 
mclaughlins oneonone show taped friday for weekend broadcast 
said i think the decision was correct to stop the gates 
speech 
baker frequently has wished gorbachev well in his reconstruction 
effort but except for offering some undefined technical advice 
the secretary of state has stressed it was up to the soviets to 
determine their future 
gates a former deputy director of the central intelligence 
agency had been scheduled to speak to the national collegiate 
security conference in bethesda md a student seminar 
some other officials of the bush administration including 
quayle defense secretary dick cheney and deputy secretary of state 
lawrence eagleburger have registered public skepticism about 
gorbachevs prospects 
baker whose top aides initially described gorbachev as mostly 
deft at public relations and adapting us ideas on arms control 
has gradually warmed to the soviet leaders uphill campaign to 
change the soviet system 
gates in a speech last year said gorbachev had not really 
changed the soviet pattern russian and soviet history caution 
us to be skeptical and cautious the thencia official said 
the speech disturbed george p shultz who was then secretary of 
state according to a knowledgeable us official shultz 
complained to gates after it was delivered

industrialist ermal cleon fraze who during 
a night of insomnia invented the removable pulltab opener used on 
beer and soft drink cans has died at the age of 76 
fraze died thursday of a brain tumor at kettering memorial 
hospital in dayton the hospital said 
fraze who obtained his first patent for the pull tabcan in 
1963 was born on a farm near muncie ind and sold newspapers as 
a child 
he later moved to dayton where his first job was assembling 
novelties for boxes of cracker jack candy in 1950 he started 
dayton reliable tool and manufacturing co which has five plants 
and 360 workers in dayton 
in 1959 while on a family picnic with some friends fraze 
became frustrated when lacking a can opener he had to use a car 
bumper to open a can of beer said frazes son mark 
and he said there must be a better way mark fraze said 
the inspiration came one night when fraze couldnt sleep he got 
up at 130 am to work on a way to attach an opening lever to a 
can 
i was only going to work on this thing for an hour he said 
later but i was up all night and it came to me just like that

eightysix percent of children say theyd be more 
likely to listen to parents advice about drugs if parents were 
honest about their own drug use according to a nationwide survey 
released thursday 
ninetyseven percent of the 500 parents polled said they discuss 
drugs with their children but 70 percent agreed most parents are 
illequipped for such talks 
yet 95 percent of both parents and children reported a 
positive impact from the talks which was not defined 
eightynine percent of the 500 children surveyed said they had 
discussed drugs with their parents 
the survey was conducted by the gallup organization for waste 
management inc the worlds largest waste handler 
the random interviews involved parents of children 8 to 17 years 
old and children 10 to 17 years old the survey had a margin of 
error of plus or minus six percentage points gallup said 
talking can be the most important element to avoiding drug 
problems said dr martin goldstein a child psychologist at 
chicago lakeshore hospital but god knows its more than telling 
kids to just say no 
if all such efforts were successful i dont think wed have 
as many teens in crisis as we do goldstein said 
the survey said 66 million americans have tried drugs and that 
many parents dont know whether to acknowledge their own use while 
discouraging their children from it 
but most children surveyed agreed at least somewhat that if 
your parents told you that they had used drugs in the past you 
would be more likely to listen to what they have to say 
if the message is i had a problem and i got help its very 
helpful because it teaches kids there are solutions goldstein 
said but its just hypocritical if they say do as i say not 
as i do 
george gallup jr cochairman of the polling company said he 
was surprised so many parents had talked to their children about 
drugs 
the good part of all this is that it may be opening up deeper 
channels for communication between parents and children gallup 
said in a telephone interview after a chicago news conference 
thursday 
waste management based in suburban oak brook said it 
commissioned the study partly because some job applicants were 
failing drugscreening tests an estimated 700 failed this year out 
of a total of 10000 applicants 
in my view an alarming number of employees are failing these 
tests company chairman dean l buntrock said in a telephone 
interview wednesday 
were aimed at children because thats where we can make the 
greatest impact with education at a vulnerable age he said 
time goes fast and very quickly theyll become part of the labor 
force in this country 
the company has produced a videotape available free through 
schools and some video stores to encourage discussions between 
parents and children 
the gallup survey also found 
fiftyeight percent of the children surveyed felt they knew 
more about drugs than their parents while 40 percent of parents 
felt they were better informed 
both parents and children believe drug education should have 
begun sooner in their case parents suggested it start when 
children are 5 the youngsters suggested 8 
nearly 75 percent of parents agreed that it doesnt matter 
what you say some kids will have drug problems anyway 
twentytwo percent of all children and 34 percent of 10 and 
11yearolds agreed with the statement my parents dont have 
time to talk to me about drugs fourteen percent of parents said 
their children dont have time

engineers this summer discovered and 
were moving to fix a seismic design flaw on three san francisco 
doubledecker freeways a flaw that scientists believe caused the 
deadly collapse of a similar doubledecker a top state engineer 
acknowledged friday 
oaklands interstate 880 was overlooked despite the fact that 
it was the oldest of five such doubledecker freeways in northern 
california because nobody in the department of transportation 
remembered until after last weeks earthquake that i880 might also 
share the flaw in its upper support column hinges caltrans 
chief structural engineer jim roberts said 
two scientific teams from the universities of california at 
berkeley and san diego have tentatively decided that the 
hinges or joints sheared off during the quake permitted 
i880s upper deck to slam down killing more than three dozen 
motorists on the lower deck 
would the repair planned for san franciscos doubledeckers have 
prevented oaklands i880 collapse roberts was asked during a 
daily press briefing 
the answer i believe is affirmative he said i think it 
would have gone a long way 
but roberts said even if i880 had been on the list for 
repair it would not have been done prior to oct 17 
hinge repairs on the other three will be expedited following the 
i880 collapse he said the three the embarcadero the china 
basin and the central viaducts all were damaged in the quake and 
are temporarily closed 
engineers discovered the hinge flaw in the embarcadero viaduct 
during an august review on whether it more earthquakeproofing 
work roberts said he confirmed the contents of an aug 21 
internal memorandum brought to his attention thursday 
the memo from one of his engineers to another turned up in a 
flood of departmental documents turned over to the news media this 
week 
roberts who said thursday he was not aware of the memo and 
questioned its acccuracy on friday he confirmed the memos 
statement that at his request the other two san francisco viaducts 
would be added to the list because state engineers recalled that 
they too contained the flaw 
asked how i880 could be overlooked roberts said maybe it 
was the lack of foresight and later he said thats 
hindsight 
roberts also acknowledged that repair on the three was not 
awaiting development of technology to strengthen 
multicolumn bridges despite his and other caltrans officials 
assertions to the contrary earlier this week 
while this remains the case with most of the states 700 
multicolumn structures that need column bolstering engineers 
planned to a physician stabilizes a leg he said 
but the splints are not very good looking and youre not 
going to leave them up permanently he said

a confrontation among the institutional big boys 
may be developing in the stock market and it has a lot to do about 
the little guy it could come to a head shortly 
at the heart of the dispute is program trading usually in the 
form of massive shortterm computertriggered buying and selling 
to exploit brief market inconsistencies it can have an explosive 
impact 
it is practiced for profit or protection by some of the biggest 
brokers in the business and it is outraging some of the others 
who say the brokers own customers are being hurt 
mostly behind the scenes some brokers and big investors have 
been pleading for a cessation brokers charles schwab amp co and 
dean witter have publicly stated their disapproval now a big 
customer has done the same 
the conflict became further defined this week when the new york 
stock exchange made plans to offer its own product for program 
traders multimilliondollar baskets of stocks that big traders 
could buy or sell as a unit 
the exchange action follows within two weeks the oct 13 slide 
when program trading was believed largely responsible for a 
financial earthquake a onehour 150 point 5 plus percent drop in 
the dow jones industrial average 
while the market rebounded on the following trading day many 
investors had had their fill such volatility they said had in it 
the chemistry of a larger collapse it was frightening investors 
it was stripping them of assets 
tired of attempts to stop the practice by means of moral 
persuasion kemper financial services inc which manages about 8 
billion in stocks much through mutual funds decided to hit the 
big boys in the pocketbook 
this week kemper told four of its brokers they would receive no 
more of its stock transactions thus depriving them of millions of 
dollars in commissions kempers chief investment officer stephen 
b timbers had several reasons for doing so 
to begin he said program trading creates volatility that leads 
to a loss of confidence it is ruining the market he said 
upsetting even the longerterm strategies of big investors such as 
kemper 
it isnt true he suggested that program trading is just a 
brief jolt that in the long run leaves the market back where it 
was does it he stated the question as a challenge 
entirely he added in the same vein 
the affect is contagious too he said why should a financing 
problem in an attempted buyout of ual corp last week have brought 
down phillip morris one of the markets premier issues mindless 
program trading he suggested 
program trading tends to ignore fundamental investment values 
stocks arent so much ownership in a company as pieces in a deadly 
serious game it is concerned more with market mechanics that the 
outlook for corporate profits 
if the market is dominated by program trading why should we 
spend so much money on research timbers asked it makes no 
sense he said and it can badly damage sophisticated longterm 
investors as well as the little guy 
timbers feels the marketplace isnt seeing much of the little 
guy these days and that its been that way since october 1987 
when the stock market took a nosedive one that program trading was 
said to exacerbate if not create 
the individual investor once the substance of the market but a 
shrinking force for more than a decade looks at the carnage and 
concludes says timbers that i might as well go to las vegas 
maybe the odds are better 
at the very time timbers was stating kempers decision the big 
board set plans for its own program trading vehicle what did he 
think of the move its the most bizarre thing ive ever heard 
of he said 
since his announcement said timbers he has been inundated with 
telephone calls most of them he said were in the nature of god 
bless you 
earlier he had heard from some other institutional investors 
some of whose opinions he said were expressed with even greater 
vehemence than his own 
based on this knowledge he said wed be surprised if other 
institutions dont follow us if they dont he said maybe 
well look foolish but his tone indicated he didnt expect that 
to happen

percent in august to 31 percent in late october according to a 
survey by the brazilian institute of public opinion and statistics 
at the same time pollsters have recorded a sharp rise for luis 
inacio lula da silva a former labor union president and candidate 
of the radical workers party and a lesser one for leonel brizola 
a veteran populist of the centerleft democratic labor party 
the institutes poll gave lula da silva 15 percent in late 
october up from 5 percent in august and brizola 14 percent up 
from 13 percent other private surveys had similar figures 
their gains have strengthened the possibility of a runoff in 
december between the two top votegetters most likely collor de 
mello on one side and either lula da silva or brizola on the other 
a runoff is called for if no candidate wins a majority nov 15 
the longoutlawed brazilian communist party is in the race for 
the first time since 1945 but its candidate roberto freire has 
only 1 percent of the vote in polls 
the bearded 44yearold lula da silva popularly known simply 
as lula a nickname he legally made part of his formal name before 
the campaign most frightens many of the businessmen and 
conservatives about the outcome of brazils first direct 
presidential election in 29 years 
not all businessmen are as concerned however as those such as 
mario amato president of the federation of industries of the 
sstate of sao paulo 
if lula takes office there will be chaos in the country 
amato said in a comment typical for those expressing the most 
concern 
he predicted capital flight would increase and 800000 
businessmen will flee the country if lula becomes president 
edson vaz musa president of the brazilian subsidiary of rhodia 
the french chemical and textile company differed with that outlook 
in an interview published by the jornal da tarde newspaper 
brazil will continue to exist and businessmen and government 
will have to adjust to a new reality he was quoted as saying 
this has happened in other countries such as france and their 
economies were not destroyed 
in a television debate lula called amatos statement an 
imbecility he said productive capitalism would be welcome 
in a workers party administration but not speculative 
capitalism 
in the campaign lula has promised that if elected he will 
sharply raise workers salaries and limit profits nationalize 
banks expropriate big ranches and farms for poor peasants suspend 
payment of brazils 110 billion foreign debt and restrict profit 
remittances by multinational companies 
brizola a former governor of rio de janeiro state who spent 15 
years in exile during brazils 19641985 rightwing military 
regime favors what he describes as a europeanstyle socialism but 
he also proposes expropriation of some private companies and 
nonpayment of the foreign debt much of which is owed to us 
banks 
ill simply show up there and say look our people dont 
want to pay any more brizola told a recent rally 
rightwing candidates have sought to capitalize on fears of a 
leftist victory 
this is also an ideological election said paulo maluf of 
the rightist social democratic party we must repudiate communism 
and candidates like leonel brizola and lula who are supported by 
communists 
jose alvaro moises a political scientist at the university of 
sao paulo disputes contentions such as malufs 
he said in an interview such fears are unfounded and 
exaggerated because lula and his party are not naive enough to 
want to destroy the capitalist system 
he has made it clear that what he wants is to correct the 
distortions that exist in brazilian capitalism distortions that 
have led to an extremely unfair distribution of income low 
salaries and an almost total lack of social priorities such as 
health education housing and transportation moises said 
he maintained that lulas rise in popularity is due to the 
peoples desire for a change for something new for a president 
with no links to the corruptionfilled political past of this 
country 
emerson klapaz president of a large plasticproducts industry 
said a possible lula government will be different from the one 
he has described in his campaign he will have to tune into what is 
happening in the rest of the world especially in communist 
nations 
if the choice comes down to brizola or lula some businessmen 
have said they would prefer brizola 
we could deal with brizola because he defends capitalism and 
free enterprise lula doesnt said supermarket tycoon joao 
carlos paes mendonca 
carlos alberto de oliveira president of the commercial 
association of the southern state of parana said lula defends 
communist ideas that are outofdate and this makes him even more 
dangerous than brizola

they draw sixdigit salaries performing in this 
entertainment capitals glitzy showrooms but when stars like frank 
sinatra bill cosby barbara mandrell and wayne newton go on 
national television to tout the city itself the tab is 1 
more than 20 celebrities are popping up on tv screens across the 
country singing the praises of las vegas where they perform 
annually 
under most circumstances the talent fees would run in the 
millions not so for las vegas convention and visitors authority 
commercials carrying the message las vegas the american way to 
play 
when rampr advertising sought out show business heavyweights for 
the tv and print ads four years ago it asked them to do it for 1 
considering the fact the celebrities earn a healthy chunk of 
their annual income in las vegas showrooms it stands to reason 
theyre willing to sing the citys praises for a buck 
the ads were the brainchild of rampr owner sig rogich and billy 
vassiliadis the agencys president 
rogich was a member of the tuesday team that produced former 
president reagans campaign advertising in 1984 and he was 
advertising director for the george bush campaign in 1988 he 
placed his interest in the agency in a blind trust earlier this 
year when he went to washington as a special assistant to bush 
handling media relations 
the idea of using stars evolved in 1985 when rampr blocked by 
federal communications commission rules that prohibit gambling 
advertising was looking for fresh ideas to sell the city 
surveys by the convention authority show that next to gaming 
entertainment is the citys leading attraction vassiliadis said 
the agency contacted sinatra the citys highestpaid 
entertainer at a reported 500000 a week he is also the star most 
identifiable with las vegas having performed here for 38 years 
it was presented to him as a way of selling las vegas 
vassiliadis recalled he was very amenable to the idea the 
towns been very good to him and hes been very good to the town 
or as sinatra put it himself through spokeswoman susan 
reynolds i have been married to the city of las vegas since 1951 
and there will never be a divorce i love it 
once sinatra accepted the 1 deal other stars fell into place 
today the list of celebrities promoting the city reads like a 
whos who in entertainment 
they include cosby newton mandrell kenny rogers rich little 
joan rivers paul anka sammy davis jr jay leno the pointer 
sisters david brenner the judds lee greenwood the mcguire 
sisters siegfried and roy the smothers brothers smokey robinson 
natalie cole don rickles norm crosby and boxers sugar ray 
leonard and tommy hearns 
working with the celebrities has been a pleasant surprise 
vassiliadis said we had been warned that some of the people 
would be terrible to work with but theyve just been great you 
hear these horror stories about how tough theyll be to deal with 
all the things you read in the rags but theyve been super 
rogers interrupted filming of a movie in oklahoma to fly to las 
vegas to do his spot when the movie ran longer than expected 
rampr is always searching out special environments to showcase the 
stars 
newton was filmed with one of his prize arabian horses at his 
las vegas ranch greenwood wellknown for his hit god bless the 
usa is shown getting into the cockpit of an f14 at nellis 
air force base here illusionists siegfried and roy who live in 
las vegas are shown walking across the strip at night with one of 
their rare white tigers 
the agency spends about 250000 a year making the 
celebritytheme commercials then spends about 4 million annually 
airing them in major las vegas market areas including los angeles 
san diego phoenix san francisco denver dallas chicago and 
detroit

is alan greenspan so intent on netting the 
fluttering butterfly of inflation that hell run off a cliff and 
take the economy with him 
thats one cartoonists view of the federal reserve chairman 
whose pursuit of inflation is his no 1 priority in effect he 
told congress that last week saying he was even willing to endure 
subpar economic growth for several years 
another view however depicts greenspan as a patient economic 
scientist carefully laying a trap for the evil insect of inflation 
that unless killed could spread a debilitating virus throughout 
the economy 
in between is probably the real greenspan a man who is indeed 
willing to see the economy operate below its potential but who is 
ready to suspend his efforts temporarily of course to avert any 
economic calamity 
if greenspan is successful in lowering inflation to near zero by 
the mid1990s as he seeks to do the economy at that time quite 
likely would be positioned for healthy growth but the price would 
be high 
some of that price already is becoming evident while inflation 
has been moderating the weakened performance of american industry 
is showing up in various statistics most ominously in a 
merchandise trade deficit 
inflation might be the no 1 issue with the fed chairman but 
closing that deficit is no 1 with other groups including some in 
the white house it had been declining but shot back up in the 
third quarter 
that situation raises the question of whether a belowpar 
economy is an important cause of the trade problem 
during the third quarter for example industrial production 
slowed to a 28 percent gain vs 42 percent in the second 
quarter could some of that lost production be equated with the 
worsening export situation 
the capacity utilization rate for manufacturing also has been 
falling earlier this year it was feared that plants were operating 
at an inflationary rate no longer the rate retreated to 837 
percent in september well below the mythical and much disputed 
inflationcausing rate of 85 percent 
an industrial slowdown means lost jobs that impact is showing 
up clearly in automotive industry layoffs although the jobless 
rate remains steady because of hiring in the service sector a 
continuation of the industrial slowdown however inevitably will 
mean layoffs sufficient to push up the jobless rate 
corporate profits are declining too and have been since the 
first quarter of the year that situation could force some 
companies to rely more heavily on debt rather than internal 
financing putting upward pressure on interest rates 
inventories are rising when inventories rise it can mean two 
different things one that business is bullish and expects higher 
sales or two sales are weakening and unsold goods are piling up 
in this instance blame no 2 
weaker corporate sales are bad news for the stock market too 
and that institution already is unsettled by its own shenanigans 
incredible nosedives of late must be watched lest one of them 
trigger a financial collapse 
greenspans pursuit of inflation therefore is not without 
great costs and constant dangers it might put a stronger 
foundation beneath the economy in the mid1990s but in the 
meantime it will take its toll 
if that toll becomes more painful the greenspan course will 
raise doubts some of which might be expressed in a plea to suspend 
the experiment and allow a little inflation in exchange for 
additional growth 
in the long run and considering that politics inevitably butts 
heads with economic theory it could be the biggest threat of all 
to the fed chairmans scientific ideal of the near perfectly 
stable noninflated economy

chris van allsburg who recently shared in one of 
the largest advances ever paid for a childrens book didnt 
hesitate when asked to cite an important influence on his work 
harold and the purple crayon he announced with speed and 
surety 
it was upon reading that crockett johnson book as a child in 
grand rapids mich that van allsburg one of americas most 
successful childrens book authors and illustrators set sail on 
his wild imaginings that have led in recent years to such works as 
jumanji the wreck of the zephyr the garden of abdul 
gasazi and the polar express which just sold its millionth 
copy 
his latest venture marks his first collaboration he was paid 
part of an 800000 advance to do the illustrations for mark 
helprins swan lake houghton mifflin 1995 helprin and the 
packager who cut the deal also shared in the 800000 the 
80page book was recently published 
in this derivative of the tchaikovsky ballet van allsburg tried 
to give his illustrations the look and flavor of a 19th century 
picture book to accompany the story of an illfated prince and 
princess 
helprins rich although sometimes strained style and van 
allsburgs satiny portraits with a far eastern tinge largely make 
for a nice fit 
but most youngsters will need an adult to get them through the 
work marked by passages such as the forest was in its own 
way inviolable a domain of hearth smoke in unwavering columns 
against a flawless blue sky of mountains clad in windbuffed ice 
of the thinnest air of rivers running white and bursting with 
oxygen 
van allsburg an admirer of helprins new yorker pieces and 
especially his novel winters tale stumbled only once as he 
tried for the first time to put pictures to someone elses script 
when he was called upon to supply a picture of the old emperor 
reclining on pillows on the floor van allsburg kept shaping the 
pillows into the form of dogs 
we talked and he said if i needed the dogs ok van allsburg 
said the pillows just looked too much like dogs and i had to go 
with the pitch 
the scene remains slightly imperfect the text says the emperor 
has a book beside him but the illustration shows him reading it 
the hardest part for van allsburg began when the book was 
completed 
houghton mifflin decided on an enormous first run of 275000 
copies including book club printings van allsburg was asked to 
handle east coast promotions and helprin the west that meant 25 
days on the road 
van allsburg a softspoken and retiring man of 40 who says one 
reason he teaches at the rhode island school of design is to force 
himself out of the studio is not particularly fond of public 
appearances 
but he is most engaging and likely to be a fine salesman 
an encounter with him is like bumping into peter pan at the aampp 
and talking about the english poet samuel taylor coleridge or 
vice versa and the ways of the imagination 
as a teacher he forces students to stretch their imaginations 
by such assignments as composing their own version of the star 
spangled banner and singing it to the class 
as a writer and illustrator he tries to fit the pieces of his 
own wonder sometimes in pastel sometimes in pencil sometimes in 
pen and ink sometimes i actually see an image in my minds eye 
which is puzzling to me and then the story comes from it as i try 
to figure it out 
my stories are a little like encountering a missing 
illustration 
he avoids conventional story resolutions with the hope that 
you close the book but your mind stays engaged thus prolonging 
fantasy 
society encourages giving up those beliefs but im in favor 
of stretching them out he says 
about the childs trip to see santa claus in the polar 
express he says if the mean age of giving up the notion of 
santa claus is say 7 years 9 months i like to think that maybe 
it the book pushed it back to 7 years 10 months for some 
santa claus and the tooth fairy make the world have greater 
potential 
his books are an open heart at times whimsical at times sad 
at times even perplexing and even after 10 popular works in as 
many years an american book award and two caldecott medals he has 
set no pattern and has no idea of exactly where he is going 
the most he can say about his next book is that im sort of 
working on something 
like harold who used his purple crayon to draw his way in and 
out of many adventures

when the stock market staged a brisk rally right 
after its scary slide on oct 13 most onlookers were relieved and 
impressed there evidently wasnt going to be a crash of 1989 after 
all 
but that performance failed to reassure some wall street 
analysts who found almost as much cause for concern in the rebound 
as they did in the drop 
after the dow jones industrial average fell more than 190 points 
on friday the 13th the optimists rallying cries began almost 
immediately 
the selloff was an aberration caused mainly by the 
spreading realization that the mergersandbuyouts boom of the past 
several years was coming under increasing strains 
the squeeze on takeover credit furthermore would ultimately 
prove beneficial by restoring investors attention to the 
traditional values that make the stock market go such as earnings 
and dividend growth 
besides everybody with memories of the crash of 1987 had 
learned that bargainhunters in big market drops could be 
handsomely rewarded when confidence was restored 
while any or all of these points may be valid the skeptics now 
say investors rushed to embrace them with an eagerness bordering 
on unreality 
just because monday oct 16 wasnt a repeat of black monday 
1987 doesnt mean that all is well contends joseph feshbach 
technical analyst at prudentialbache securities 
this isnt the worst of all possible investment worlds but it 
certainly isnt the best 
two years ago feshbach noted pessimism abounded and 
pessimism proved wrong today optimistic investors are comparing 
1989 with 1987 although the fundamentals and the internals of the 
market are very different this year from what they were two years 
ago 
those differences have been widely described as favorable for 
the market outlook now for instance priceearnings ratios of 
stocks are much lower now than the lofty levels they reached in the 
summer of 87 
similarly there appears much less danger now of an accelerating 
economy that would prompt the federal reserve to tighten credit 
but many analysts view the contrasts in sentiment between 
october 1987 and october 1989 much differently 
the crash of 87 was almost universally viewed as a fearsome 
event friday the 13th this october was dismissed by many as just a 
brief dizzy spell 
if the past is any guide significant market declines dont end 
in periods of eagerness to shop for bargains in stocks but rather 
when sentiment surrenders its enthusiasm and becomes scared in 
the words of justin mamis at cowan amp co 
the 1989 selloff and its aftermath prompted joseph barthel 
technical analyst at hopper soliday amp co to recommend that 
investors reduce their exposure to the stock market 
the burden of proof that friday oct 13 was just a fluke 
remains squarely on the shoulders of the bulls he asserts 
whatever the eventual outcome analysts who see the markets 
recent antics in a negative light say the prevailing optimistic 
view was selfcontradictory 
on the one hand the selloff was described as unlike the 87 
crash because it occurred in such different circumstances 
on the other it was embraced as a buying opportunity very 
similar to what occurred two years before 
either one of those interpretations could turn out to be true 
the skeptics say but not likely both

jaclyn smith is up to her neck in money in 
her new abc mystery series christine cromwell old money new 
money and stolen money 
she stars as a san francisco investment counselor who keeps 
getting involved in crimes in the show that begins this weekend on 
the abc saturday mystery movie 
its a different feeling from the movies and miniseries ive 
been doing said smith whose last series was charlies 
angels in 197681 
its regular but its not every week its a character who 
can change and develop and that i can put more of myself into ive 
been playing so many victims so many emotional roles this is much 
more intellectual the mysteries are quite complex i have to read 
the scripts twice to understand them but i think the viewers will 
find them easier to follow visually through the eyes of the 
characters 
christine cromwell along with the newly added kojak 
joins columbo and bl stryker in the rotating movie 
series it gives the mix a glamorous element and lighter mystery 
peter falk is the diamondintherough columbo burt reynolds is 
the reluctant florida private eye stryker and telly savalas is back 
as the tough flashy detective theo kojak 
smiths show originally was called amanda vanderbilt that 
caused conflict because of a line of designer clothes and it 
became christine claiborne conflict arose again because of 
another line of clothes and a fragrance wanting a name that 
conveyed elegance glamour and old money everyone finally agreed 
on christine cromwell 
its about the charmed life of the very rich said smith 
its somewhat reminiscent of the movies of the 1930s christine 
is from old money back east shes very bright involved in 
charities and works because she wants to she has many qualities 
and values that i admire 
celeste holm plays my mother whos been married seven times 
each of my stepfathers has an expertise that i call on in solving 
the cases mothers a kind of auntie mame type my boss at the 
investment firm is ralph bellamy 
although shell come up against the rich they wont all be 
refined in one show she deals with a coarse detective played by 
dennis franz that particular episode also marks one of the series 
few ventures into humor 
most of the stories will show that the rich not only get into 
trouble they also have more money with which to dig themselves in 
deeper 
im used to doing straight serious roles said smith the 
role of the intellectual and having to put across what shes 
thinking and doing is more difficult than an emotional role its 
a great challenge the memory work is extensive having to say all 
the legal background 
this is also a long way from charlies angels that was very 
tongueincheek this is much more real 
since charlies angels smith has starred in such movies as 
escape from bogen county the users jacqueline bouvier 
kennedy and most recently nbcs settle the score 
miniseries include rage of angels george washington 
rage of angels ii windmills of the gods and the bourne 
identity 
when i started the series i thought im going to be away 
from the children she said my kids have been to san 
francisco for some location filming theyve come to the set after 
school its good for them to see that their mother works 
after completing the bourne identity she took seven months 
to devote time to her children gaston 7 and spencer margaret 
wholl be 4 in december 
this is a longer commitment than a movie or miniseries she 
said i enjoy it i work 12hour days but im home in time to 
have dinner with the children read them stories and put them to 
bed

at first the instinct was to wave it off the 
way a referee picks up the penalty flag he didnt intend to throw 
but then congress decided that the 285 billion appropriated 
for disaster relief after the california earthquake should after 
all count against the governments deficit quota probably 
starting next year not now 
the government tried to discipline itself with the law that 
limits annual deficits but it also can change laws that amounts 
to optional discipline 
rep bob michel the republican leader said the grammrudman 
rules for deficit reduction are a disciplinary tool that shouldnt 
be evaded you dont discard it because it is inconvenient he 
said it is supposed to be inconvenient 
theres a tendency to argue that some appropriations like this 
one are just too important to be counted against a budget ceiling 
thats already been reached and passed because it makes them 
harder to enact 
and moves that provide budget leeway also serve the republican 
administration which is determined to keep its barrier high 
against new taxes the white house said none will be necessary to 
finance the disaster relief bill the largest in history the 
second largest also passed this fall 11 billion as a result of 
hurricane hugo 
nobody questioned the decision to provide the money but there 
was ample house debate on how to count it the senate in a vote 
that is only advisory said budget negotiators ought to cut other 
programs by 1 billion the amount of disaster relief money likely 
to be spent this year 
californians were candid about their determination to get as 
much as possible as quickly as possible before the sense of crisis 
eases 
later on well be just another budgetary problem said rep 
vic fazio dcalif he also said that the emergency appropriation 
was little more than a down payment and that added funds probably 
will be sought in the spring 
the double disasters of hurricane and earthquake already are 
another budgetary problem the government is operating under 
automatic spending cuts imposed two weeks ago to trim 161 billion 
from projected spending thats because congress has not settled on 
a measure to prune the projected deficit to no more than 110 
billion for the year that began oct 1 
and that was before the disaster appropriations 
hence the search for ways to keep the bill from adding to the 
squeeze as drafted for house action the disaster appropriation 
said the spending it provided would not be charged against the 
grammrudman ceiling 
that was fine with the white house more interested in resisting 
pressure for new taxes than in the fine print of the budget control 
system according to the administration the earthquake money wont 
affect the current deficit crunch because the deadline for dealing 
with it has come and gone without action 
that would leave the extra spending to be counted next year 
when according to white house press secretary marlin fitzwater 
its a whole other ballgame it may be a more difficult 
ballgame since the deficit ceiling for that budget year will be 
more stringent only 64 billion unless congress decides to ease it 
thats not unlikely 
just as surely as we erect one barrier we find a way around 
it complained rep sylvio o conte rmass who got the 
disaster appropriation amended so that it will have to be counted 
against future grammrudman ceilings 
he said the idea of pretending the earthquake spending wasnt 
being added to the deficit was an escape hatch to fantasy land 
we spend it ha ha ha but it doesnt count its magic 
its voodoo and its bogus 
there were counterarguments that counting the disaster spending 
against the limit is going to force cuts in other programs that 
already are short of funds every nickel you are spending will 
come out of some other programs hide education child care 
nutrition the homeless drugs defense you name it said rep 
bob traxler dmich 
those are indeed difficult choices the people running 
government are supposed to make tough choices

the spectacle of americans held hostage overseas 
helped topple one us administration drove another into the 
irancontra scandal and continues to bedevil a us government torn 
between a desire to free its captive citizens and reluctance to 
negotiate with terrorists ten years after iranian students overran 
the us embassy in tehran the issue is no less painful and the 
solutions no more clear 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
for the nation that prides itself as the 
mightiest on earth hazy television images of americans held 
hostage in the middle east have become a bitter lesson in the 
limits of power 
few issues have so frustrated the american public and its 
leaders since radical iranian students stormed the us embassy in 
tehran 10 years ago this week on nov 4 1979 and took 53 
americans hostage 
president bush has toned down the rhetoric in an attempt to keep 
the public from focusing too closely on an issue that helped topple 
jimmy carter and led ronald reagan into the worst foreign policy 
scandal of the 1980s 
but at the same time bush is enlisting third parties in an 
effort to deal with iran and free the eight americans now held by 
iranianbacked moslems in lebanon 
carter hounded by questions about the tehran hostages and the 
united states inability to free them withdrew to the white house 
rose garden to wage much of his 1980 reelection campaign 
those hostages eventually were freed after 444 days on the day 
reagan was inaugurated jan 20 1981 
but nearly six years later reagans presidency was rocked by 
the irancontra affair revelations that his aides had sold weapons 
to iran in hopes of freeing the hostages in lebanon and diverted 
the proceeds to nicaraguan rebels the arms deals came when reagan 
was proclaiming publicly that the united states would not negotiate 
for the hostages release 
washington has had no diplomatic relations with iran since the 
revolutionary government seized power there in early 1979 
with little fanfare however the united states has been using 
intermediaries japan pakistan algeria and switzerland to name 
a few to send messages to tehran says gary sick author of a 
book about carters hostage crisis and a national security council 
aide during the democrats presidency 
the thrust of bushs thirdparty messages is that the united 
states is ready for better ties but the hostages must be freed 
first analysts say 
bush is conscious of irans power and hes shown an interest 
in putting things right says frederick axelgard a senior fellow 
at the center for strategic and international studies 
while bush has tried to play down the hostage issue publicly he 
was forced to react when a group calling itself the organization 
for the oppressed on earth reported on july 31 that it had killed 
marine lt col william r higgins 
the president cut short a trip to the midwest and returned to 
washington to condemn the brutal and tragic events but he did 
nothing to retaliate 
in sicks view bush simply doesnt have many options 
after the irancontra episode he cant afford to be tagged 
with a trade a deal in effect it has tied his hands he says 
publicly the administrations position on the hostages is the 
same as the reagan administrations was after the irancontra 
scandal secretary of state james baker iii reiterated that policy 
last week 
the iranian government has known for a long time that we are 
quite prepared to have open discussions with representatives of 
that government provided they renounce their pursuit of terrorism 
and provided they take actions to seek the release and freedom of 
our american hostages he said 
irans president ali akhbar hashemi rafsanjani said last week 
that he would help free the american hostages if the united states 
would release billions of dollars of assets frozen 10 years ago 
after the tehran embassy takeover 
the united states rejects linking the assets valued at between 
9 billion and 12 billion to the hostages 
us officials say those disputes are slowly but surely being 
dealt with by the iranus claims tribunal in the hague 
netherlands as of august us nationals had been awarded about 
12 billion by the tribunal iranians had received 118 million 
the state department said 
despite the stalemate analysts say a number of factors could 
in the long run help bush resolve the hostage issue 
among them the death this year of ayatollah ruhollah khomeini 
the hardline spiritual father of the iranian revolution the end 
of the iraniraq war and the peace plan between moslems and 
christians in lebanon 
if the lebanese accord works if rafsanjani is able to 
continue to consolidate his political base then we are getting to 
an atmosphere in which it may be possible for something to take 
place says judith kipper a middle east expert at the brookings 
institution 
kipper says rafsanjanis need to rebuild his country and obtain 
technology and economic assistance could lead him to help secure 
the hostages release 
in addition the august 1988 ceasefire in the iraniraq war has 
reduced the perceived threat in the persian gulf and allowed the 
united states to cut back its military force there the iranians 
probably view that as a positive sign sick says 
maj barry willey of the us central command says 10 us ships 
remain in the gulf down from about 17 a year ago 
complicating the hostage picture however is the relationship 
between iran and the lebanese kidnappers thought to be factions of 
the hezbollah umbrella group 
axelgard says there are some signs that iran has distanced 
itself from hezbollah 
but shaul bakhash a professor at george mason university 
disputes that view recent visits to iran by sheik mohammed 
fadlallah spiritual leader of hezbollah dont suggest a lessening 
of contact between the two he says

melvin belli the barrister of disaster 
went into action on lawsuits from the big earthquake almost as soon 
as he stopped shaking at candlestick park 
belli filed 22 million worth of claims friday against the state 
on behalf of 10 victims of the collapse of interstate 880 on oct 
17 that killed at least 39 people 
the claims 3 million for each of two wrongful deaths and 2 
million for each of eight injured survivors are the first step in 
what bellis partner richard e brown believes will be more than 
200 million in suits by many lawyers in the i880 tragedy 
thousands of san francisco bay area residents are busy seeking 
profits from the quake 
great sums perhaps more than the 7 billion or more in damage 
estimates are shifting from the government insurers bank loans 
and savings accounts to workers and companies rebuilding the bay 
area 
a few were accused of profiteering taking unreasonable gains 
from the emergency the night of the quake some are after the fast 
buck with quake gimmicks and tshirts 
one persons bad luck is anothers opportunity but most of 
those benefiting from the quake are simply and honestly doing their 
jobs 
engineers architects contractors and masons who will fix 
thousands of buildings are making big money as a result of the 
quake 
as for the lawyers their civil suits would follow 45 days after 
the filing of claims if the claims are rejected by the state 
i think weve got a substantial lawsuit because the state 
definitely was negligent said belli whose firm is talking with 
about 30 other survivors and families of people killed in the i880 
collapse 
i think were going to be able to show that they didnt use 
adequate supports he said whats more important they knew 
they were shortcutting and they used the money on something else 
belli whose uninsured office building has been redtagged as 
unsafe and may need more than 1 million in repairs plans to move 
his staff books and files on monday and work on the i880 case and 
others stemming from the quake 
his office phone was out for three days after the quake but as 
soon as service started up it kept ringing with people wanting to 
sue somebody 
at least 50 people have contacted us about lawsuits were 
also handling for free the problems of people trying to collect 
money on loans from the federal government were very busy 
so are construction crews from santa cruz to san francisco 
preparing to put up new homes once the rubble is cleared 
lumberyards are already humming 
glaziers are clearing away the shards of countless broken 
windows and installing new panes chimney sweeps are checking out 
damage that could cause a fire building inspectors are studying 
cracks in the walls roofs floors and foundations plumbers are 
repairing broken pipes and toppled water heaters helicopters and 
ferries are carrying commuters while the bay bridge is closed 
neighborhood restaurants in san francisco and others in marin 
county and the east bay are packing in diners partly at the 
expense of the usual tourist spots along fishermans wharf and the 
hardhit marina district 
disaster recovery services are providing replacement computers 
and other office needs headhunters are getting more business from 
companies finding it difficult to lure employees to the bay area 
after the quake 
reporters photographers and tv crews are working overtime to 
cover it all 
the quake destroyed so much but was a boon to dozens of 
businesses 
its terrible no its not terrible it is great said mina 
talebzadeh controller of west bay glass co in san francisco so 
much broken glass is in the town the first week we worked day and 
night but weve slowed down a little bit because the crew is 
tired 
west bay a small firm with a sixman crew hired six more 
workers last week and replaced about 500 windows 10 times the 
usual number 
the biggest job nearly 40000 in labor for three days of 
roundtheclock service was cleaning glass from about 150 windows 
in a sevenstory department store now west bay is hoping to win 
the bid to replace those windows 
louis bobrowsky an engineer and architect who inspects homes 
and commercial buildings said hes been working up to 12 hours a 
day 
we would normally get eight to 12 calls a day now were 
getting 100 weve been telling the people what to look for and not 
charging them for it if serious cracks or separations come up 
then i go out and see it 
will prater a pilot at astrocopters ltd of oakland said 
business was nonstop in the days after the quake when the company 
had its own five choppers and three subleased ones hauling celluar 
telephones to santa cruz for hours 
about eight helicopter firms took advantage of the crippled san 
franciscooakland bay bridge and i880 to sell a fast expensive 
alternative for executives emergency workers and media personnel 
commercial helicopters normally arent allowed to fly into san 
francisco because of neighborhood complaints about noise but the 
opening of the port of san franciscos piers 3032 was an emergency 
earthquake action 
the copter commute costs 150 to 200 roundtrip the bay bridge

once again freetrade advocates are leading 
the us assault on hidebound doctrines quotas subsidies and 
other protectionist gimmicks that keep the world from a better life 
for consumers and fatter profits for farmers 
thats one view 
another is that american farmers and consumers are on a winding 
path through dark forests and threatening chasms where wickedness 
and mysterious forces lurk ready to pounce and gobble up the 
mighty us food machine 
meanwhile there are all shades of support and criticism about 
the governments proposal to revamp global agricultural trade the 
proposal finely tuned over the last three months was presented 
last week to the general agreement on tariffs and trade in geneva 
since world war ii the 97nation gatt has been the principal 
regulatory body for international trade the eighth round of 
negotiations which are held periodically to update the rules 
began in punta del este uruguay on sept 20 1986 and will 
continue through 1990 
a major us drive in the uruguay round was to put agricultural 
trade up front during the negotiations the united states has 
called for cutbacks or the elimination of trade distorting 
programs and policies 
one feature of the plan submitted to gatt calls for the 
elimination of commodity export subsidies within five years some 
other programs would be phased out over 10 years while others 
would be retained as long as they do not distort world trade 
the plan is aimed at trade liberalization so that us crops 
meat poultry and dairy products have the fullest possible access 
to foreign markets therein advocates say lie the future riches 
of us agriculture 
sen patrick leahy dvt as chairman of the senate agriculture 
committee supports the idea of eliminating export subsidies 
indicating their elimination should be the top priority of gatt 
negotiations 
but leahy cautioned that a bad gatt deal is worse than no deal 
at all it must be crystal clear agriculture cannot be traded off 
for gains in intellectual property trade in services or any other 
area of these negotiations 
us trade representative carla hills who was joined by 
agriculture secretary clayton yeutter last week in announcing the 
proposal said the gatt talks are entering the most creative 
phase of the uruguay round of negotiations 
the agricultural proposal and one on trade and services 
submitted to gatt earlier in the week represent a microcosm of 
our broad goal to eliminate the hundreds of ways that 
governments distort trade and restrict fair competition hills 
said we seek to achieve this goal through fundamental reform in 
the global trading system 
what do all these have to do with american farmers 
yeutter a former university of nebraska economics professor as 
well as a farmer cited one study that indicated the cost of trade 
distortions in agriculture alone in developed nations is about 165 
billion a year 
yeutter said that for every dollar of financial assistance to 
farmers in developed countries about 140 is spent by consumers 
taxpayers or a combination of the two 
in other words there is about a 40 percent slippage and if 
we can through negotiations correct that 40 percent slippage 
factor we can theoretically increase farm incomes or comparably 
increase benefits to consumers and taxpayers by that amount he 
said 
if it were all passed on to farmers yeutter said one should 
be able on paper at least to increase farm incomes in the 
developed world by as much as 40 percent 
by that reckoning he said this years farm income estimated at 
50 billion would go up by an additional 20 billion 
leland swenson president of the national farmers union is 
among those who arent convinced that scrapping subsidies right and 
left opening trade doors and demolishing barriers is a realistic 
goal 
one problem that swenson and others have with the trade proposal 
is that it would seek the 10year elimination of income support 
policies linked to production or marketing the proposal would 
allow income support policies not linked to production or 
marketing 
according to the proposal only direct income payments to 
producers that are not tied to current production prices the cost 
of production or marketings of agricultural commodities would be 
permitted after the 10year phaseout 
swenson in a telephone interview said his group is adamantly 
opposed to the elimination of price support programs that are tied 
to production thats our domestic farm program he said 
but the farmers union would go along with the elimination of 
direct export subsidies including the export enhancement program 
used by the united states to meet foreign competition if other 
countries do the same 
yeutter was asked about the opposition of some farm 
organizations to the us proposals at gatt and that there has 
been talk that you are really trying to eliminate the us 
agricultural program altogether 
as i indicated earlier we are not going to eliminate anything 
unless our trading partners are prepared to take comparable 
actions he replied that is a matter for the negotiating 
table 
yeutter also repeated his assertion that the proposal is in the 
best interest of american farmers and will clearly and very 
substantially increase farm incomes in the united states 
if there are some farm organizations that would prefer lower 
farm income to higher farm incomes then they can defend that 
position to their membership he said i prefer high farm 
incomes to lower incomes and i will articulate that cause in a 
very active way

the uptown string quartet philips diane monroe and lesa 
terry violins maxine roach viola eileen m folson cello 
 
and now for something completely different 
a listener needs a change now and again and this disc from the 
uptown string quartet is spring cleaning for jaded ears 
the name gives a clue a marriage of the string quartet with 
the sounds from far uptown beyond 110th street in manhattan a big 
shot of jazz a little rag a little blues a lot of polish 
listen to midnight child and its evident why the mix is so 
convincing the virtuoso notebending of the blues and gospel 
singers was born for the violin so too were the strutting 
rhythms of calvary and doggone if scott joplin didnt have 
strings in mind when he wrote easy winners 
it helps too that the four players are demon fiddlers whose 
various experiences include the philadelphia orchestra 
dreamgirls the new york philharmonic frank sinatra sammy 
davis jr wynton marsalis and producer max roachs double quartet 
yes it may seem a little strange but this is no beethovens 
ninth for massed accordion band kind of stunt each of a dozen cuts 
is perfectly idiomatic fresh piquant just right 
the uptown string quartet threatens to give crossover recordings

trash epic alice cooper 
 
don henley recently complained that pop music has become 
moronic which would mean that alice cooper was way ahead of his 
time 
happily two decades after the release of his first record 
cooper still sounds moronic trash his latest album is 
impossible to take seriously and almost as hard to dislike 
dont be fooled by the biker sentiments the overwrought cooper 
spits out over grinding guitars these tunes are cartoons they 
have more in common with sam kinnison than judas priest 
no image is too obvious for cooper which is half the fun and 
he shows cleverness in other ways ill drive you like a hammer 
on a bed of nails cooper sings then the punch line ow ow 
ow ow ow 
the band is headbanger friendly guitarist john mccurry nicely 
frames coopers frenzy and guest appearances by aerosmith and jon 
bon jovi add to the fun 
there are some dead spots but such hormonal imbalances as im 
your gun and this maniacs in love with you make trash 
the funniest heavymetal record since spinal tap whether cooper 
intended it to be that way is really immaterial

if you became a father in the last three decades 
odds are you could experience what your father couldnt being 
there 
if you became a mother you may have avoided what to many women 
of your mothers generation was a humiliating experience 
credit your parents and yourselves for the change says penny 
simkin an internationally recognized childbirth educator and 
author of a new guide for fathers medical caregivers and others 
who help women give birth 
simkin a physical therapist and a mainstay of the childbirth 
education association of seattle has written the birth partner 
everything you need to know to help a woman through childbirth 
simkin and ceas janet whalley and anne keppler already have won 
seattle a reputation within the natural childbirth movement and 
wrote a widely used text for new parents pregnancy childbirth 
and the newborn published in 1984 
its one of the most accepted books in the childbirth field 
said trudy keller president of the international childbirth 
education association the seattle group is one of the most 
influential within icea and simkin and keppler especially are 
sought to speak on teaching techniques she said 
since the late 1950s treatment of pregnant women and 
fatherstobe has changed mostly because parents have demanded it 
realization that pregnancy and birth really are conditions of 
health and not illness simkin said has given consumers more 
leeway in what kind of care they can get 
it wasnt long ago that giving birth meant being drugged shaved 
and strapped to a table and stirrups while husbands waited in the 
hall its common for women to resent the humiliation they felt 
even long after their children are grown wherever i go a woman 
comes up and says when you talk about remembering and she 
gives me this story about how she was hurt 
while medical intervention often is critical in most normal 
births the mother should call the shots simkin says and tells 
birth partners your main role is to help her have the kind 
of birth she desires 
her book published by harvard common press already has been 
hailed by experts including la leche league international 
cofounder marian tompson who said its destined to become the 
birth partners bible 
i think its terrific said sheila kitzinger a leader of 
the natural childbirth movement and author of the complete book 
of pregnancy and childbirth 
its very much needed i think it will be very helpful for a 
husband for anyone supporting a woman in childbirth mrs 
kitzinger said in an telephone interview from her home near oxford 
england 
as recently as the 1970s natural childbirth meant birth 
without pain medication but still with the mother on her back 
feet in stirrups and usually undergoing an episiotomy or incision 
to widen the vagina simkin said 
today threequarters of all new mothers receive childbirth 
education and women who want to avoid drugs are encouraged to do 
whatever helps them relax in labor be it a warm bath walking 
hospital halls massage cold treatments or special breathing 
techniques 
having the father at her side to encourage steady and coach is 
crucial simkin said i would say the father is the sine qua non 
i think the love and the intimate knowledge of the woman cant be 
replicated by anyone else 
her book much of which has appeared as photocopies and handouts 
in her classes offers dozens of suggestions for easing labor as 
well as information on whats going on physically and emotionally 
in the mother 
its a very concise stepbystep guide mrs kitzinger 
said i think its also got a warmth in it an understanding of 
how the partner may be feeling 
ceas started in the 1950s and is the thirdoldest group 
associated with the international childbirth education association 
simkin 51 didnt become involved until 1968 when she and her 
husband peter a professor of medicine at the university of 
washington moved to seattle with their four children she thought 
teaching ceas classes would be a good parttime job 
i was not sure childbirth education was really helpful i had 
had four babies without it but at a reunion following her first 
class she was taken by the enthusiastic response from the new 
parents i really got hooked 
ceas which has about 40 instructors teaches more than 2500 
families a year simkin estimates she has taught over 4500 
families in 21 years 
though she is allied with ceas and is one of its teachers 
simkin has made a business of teaching childbirth instructors and 
publishing specialized books and pamphlets for them classes cover 
anatomy and physiology but also focus on what parents want from 
childbirth beyond a healthy child time is spent on feelings and 
practicing breathing massage and other comfort measures 
so often things we emphasize in childbirth class really 
havent been explored in a relationship simkin said its not 
sexual but intimacy how she likes to be touched how she likes to 
be talked to a lot find they learn about their partner things 
theyve never known 
the classes also teach how a woman can negotiate with a doctor 
or hospital for the birth she wants while most caregivers now 
accept natural childbirth as the norm and many hospitals give 
their own classes i think there are people in this field who 
still resent women and partners who want to participate i 
guess the message i would give to medical caregivers would be 
this woman will never forget this day in her life and she will 
never forget your part in it and you have a choice in how you will 
be remembered

deep thought couldnt topple world chess 
champion garri kasparov but computers are gaining and it soon may 
be no contest the machine will one day beat man at any of his own 
games scientists say 
computers will eventually be able to outthink us said 
marvin minsky an electrical engineering professor at mit its 
just a matter of evolution the evolution of computers will be 
faster than the evolution of animals 
as computers evolve the differences between electronic and 
fleshandblood brains will become less distinct minsky said 
some day well have machines that think like humans people are 
humans that think like machines 
the brain is made of hundreds of billions of little cells and 
theyre each sort of like little computers and they each do a 
little calculation you could say its just a big machine 
nonetheless in a twogame brain vs byte matchup oct 22 at the 
new york academy of art kasparov won both games kasparov who 
hasnt lost a tournament since 1981 has an international chess 
federation rating of 2775 deep thought which beat a human 
grandmaster a year ago and captured the 1989 world computer chess 
championship is given a 2251 a beginner typically is about 1200 
kasparov said deep thought was fully aggressive but its 
mind was too straight and too primitive 
chess is much wider than just calculations its even wider 
than logic you have to use fantasy intuition and some kind of 
prediction 
deep thought is actually a computer program developed by 
carnegie mellon university researchers its two highspeed chips 
enable it to analyze 720000 possible board positions per second 
but fenghsiung hsu who designed the computers silicon guts said 
he wouldnt call his creation intelligent 
we produced a machine that behaves like its intelligent but 
its not he said its just mathematical applications when 
humans play chess they use their intelligence when machines play 
chess they do calculations 
its just a matter of time before computers wise up and use 
reason to analyze options said hans berliner the brains behind 
hitech another carnegie mellon chess program that ranks second to 
deep thought in the computer world 
intelligence is the question of understanding 
counterexamples you have a certain rule that takes you a certain 
distance he said the real expert knows when theres 
exceptions to those rules people dont learn this kind of stuff 
overnight were trying to put this stuff into machines 
the secret to making machines reason lies in making machines 
that can learn he said i think we will have programs kind of 
like a science fiction thing where you will leave your machine 
turned on when you go home at night and in the morning its learned 
something you never even knew existed i think that kind of thing 
will be real by the year 2000 
a computer like hitech looks at 30 million positions in the 
space of three minutes he said the human being may look at 30 
to 50 positions like onemillionth the number computers can now 
look way far ahead at things that people never even dreamed of 
because of that many of the best humans are turning down 
invitations to match wits in tournaments against machines like 
hitech and deep thought 
i wouldnt stand a chance against either of those machines 
said jim meyer assistant director of the us chess federation 
meyers said playing computers isnt much fun 
chess is a contest of egos he said you dont have an ego 
playing against you when youre playing a computer 
the technology developed in computer chess systems could be 
applied to solving complex problems like routing electrical 
systems designing computer chips or analyzing the chemical 
properties of molecules that contain more than 1000 atoms 
berliner said there are things that these machines can do that i 
dont think human beings are equipped are to do 
that seems to be the place where theres a lot of opportunity 
for the human race to use machines either for good or bad to change 
life

when the gringo arrived with his 
talk of putting trees and terraces in the fields an intense debate 
began here 
the peasants were suspicious why did he care whether they 
planted any trees was it so the americans could come cut them down 
when they grew large 
some however realized something had to be done there was no 
place to go no more forests to cut and burn and clear for crops 
and every year the rains washed away more of the thin tropical 
topsoil 
some people understood that we ourselves are part of the 
problem others didnt said hector lopez a farmer they 
blamed other things some said it was the government one man told 
me the weather was changing because the americans were going to the 
moon 
lopez 31 looked down at his twoyearold son 
when i was a kid of 6 7 8 years old there were more trees 
more woods more springs its not even 20 years but it has 
changed so much 
eleven percent of guatemalas forests have disappeared in the 
past decade said kirsten johnson head of a care agroforestry 
project trying to reverse the trend it recently won a 2 million 
grant from applied energy services a us company that is building 
coalfired power plants in the united states and is looking for a 
way to help offset the pollution the plants would cause 
some of guatemalas forests have fallen victim to logging 
ranching and agribusiness interests others to pressure of a 
growing population of peasants desperate for a plot of land to 
feed their families johnson said 
what is happening in this hamlet of about 300 families reflects 
a new approach to the problem forests are not being replanted 
there is no place for them now the people need the land 
the care project began in 1974 and now aims at changing lives 
not landscapes johnson said massive reforestation projects of the 
1970s and early 1980s failed because they didnt take into account 
the causes of deforestation people have certain very clear needs 
for food fuel and construction wood they are not able to meet 
those needs 
guatemala has one of the most unequal distributions of land in 
the hemisphere about 45 percent of landholders own 70 percent of 
the land and it is the richest for peasants theres no place 
to go except up the hillsides johnson said 
many hillsides once covered by trees now are bare stripped 
for firewood and fence posts and to make way for the beans and corn 
on which peasants live 
the area around guichipilin 76 miles southeast of guatemala 
city was deforested by the early 1960s some peasants are now 
farming hillsides so steep they use ropes to hoist themselves up 
and down their plots 
the program moved into guachipilin three years ago its budget 
is 300000 a year largely for design planning and followup 
other support supplies and peace corps volunteers are funded by 
the us agency for international development and the guatemalan 
government 
chris best a peace corp volunteer who helped bring the program 
to guachipilin returned recently to say goodbye to his friend 
hector before leaving guatemala they laughed about how suspicious 
people had been when chris arrived with his ideas for living 
fences of trees for mixing crops and trees for building 
terraces 
a lot of people who were ignorant have changed hector said 
recalling the man who blamed things on sending man to the moon 
best an ethnobotanist and lopez inspected a eucalyptus tree 
they planted together patting the trunk approvingly 
the changes at guilchipilin have been modest so far but the 
seeds of both trees about 20000 in bests second year there 
and ideas were planted terraces were built village nurseries 
started techniques were passed on 
peasants are learning how to conserve their soil mix or 
alternate traditional crops with trees that produce fruit or 
firewood or shade they are learning to keep what little land they 
have productive 
a lot of people have been running off to the peten they say 
there is land up there in the north lopez said but i say that 
is not the answer you have to conserve what you have you have to 
think of your children

american communities are starving for trees 
according to a new study of streets in 300 us cities and towns 
most us cities could accommodate more than twice as many trees 
as they have and are missing out on energy savings said james 
kielbaso of michigan state university a lead researcher in the 
american forestry association study if we double the number of 
trees in our cities we would in effect triple the environmental 
benefits of trees such as cooling the air cutting energy costs 
preventing soil erosion and absorbing carbon dioxide one of the 
leading causes of the greenhouse effect kielbaso said 
there are an estimated 60 million street trees in the country 
an average of 78 per mile spaced an average 150 feet apart he 
said decreasing the space between trees to 50 feet would allow for 
nearly 100 million new street trees 
the study also found that only half of 1 percent of city budgets 
are spent on trees most street trees are small twothirds are 
under 12 inches in diameter and most medium to large trees are in 
fair to poor condition 
research is just now beginning to show the environmental and 
economic value of our urban forests said gary moll the afas 
vice president of urban forestry it is also revealing that our 
tree cover is simply too low 
the afa has launched a citizens treeplanting campaign called 
global releaf aimed at getting 100 million trees planted in us 
communities by 1992 increasing the size of the nations urban 
forests 15 percent to 20 percent 
the urban forest is one of the citys most precious 
resources said afa executive vice president r neil sampson the 
creator of global releaf yet for every four trees that expire 
only one is being replaced in our larger cities leaving cities 
starving for trees

soviet scientists plan to set up a 
station near here and another in blacksburg va next year to 
monitor earthquakes under an agreement that also will lead to us 
stations in the soviet union 
the us stations will fill a gap in a network run by the us 
geological surveys albuquerque seismological laboratory the 
network includes more than 100 stations around the world and is 
like a giant telescope looking inside the earth said 
geophysicist jon peterson the labs former director 
soviet scientists have had access to us seismic information 
but western scientists have been denied information gathered by the 
soviets geologists say the exchange will help them to understand 
earthquakes study the earths core and design seismic networks for 
monitoring proposed nuclear test bans 
even if there were no nuclear weapons in the world we would 
still like seismic stations in the soviet union said gregory van 
der vink of incorporated research institutions for seismology in 
arlington va 
weve always tried to extend the network into china and the 
soviet union because obviously thats a large land mass peterson 
said chinese and us officials began operating a ninestation 
system in october 1986 
the soviets are eager to improve their ability to predict 
earthquakes in the aftermath of last decembers quake in soviet 
armenia that measured 69 on the richter scale and killed tens of 
thousands of people he said 
us stations will be set up in armenia and irkutsk others have 
been set up in moscow sverdlovsk kislovodsk and garm 
the agreement calls for the soviets to receive data from 
stations at albuquerque hawaii san diego st louis and boston 
and to establish their own at albuquerque and blacksburg 
the network of stations gives scientists a better view of the 
earths interior by combining information from around the world to 
draw computerized threedimensional views much like a cat scan 
does of the body the technique called seismic tomography has 
given geologists glimpses of the irregular shape of the earths 
iron core geologists hope the tomography will reveal why the large 
plates that make up the earths surface move as they do

the passive integrated tag gun actually is a pistolshaped 
sensing unit connected to a computer it sets off an alarm when it 
detects a tiny metal tag placed in the body of a lobster said game 
warden mike castleton 
when a lobster is showered with the invisible but harmless beam 
the tag number is recorded and displayed on a monitor the tags 
nearly impossible to detect with the naked eye give crustaceans 
sort of an electronic fingerprint 
the device has been used to track migrating fish for several 
years but was used to catch a poacher of california spiny lobsters 
for the first time in early october off the san diego coast 
castleton said 
it remains to be seen however whether the gun will reduce such 
illegal catches or just cause poachers to figure out ways to avoid 
detection they are forcing us to become more sophisticated 
castleton said 
you catch on to all their tricks after a while when youve 
seen the same thing a couple of hundred times people try to hide 
lobsters in their clothes secret compartments in their boats all 
over 
though its now being used only against sport fishermen 
castleton said he expects the electronic gun eventually to be used 
to reduce commercial poaching commercial fishermen often complain 
that competitors raid their traps 
more dishonest fishermen than ever seem to be plucking lobsters 
and other fish from southern california waters he said entire 
generations of lobsters can be wiped out by just a few aggressive 
poachers 
california spiny lobsters which thrive off the san diego coast 
live in crevices and feed at night on fish algae eel grass and 
invertebrates their name is derived from the sharp spines on their 
shells they dont have large pinching claws like their cousins in 
the atlantic ocean

towering above this industrial enclave 
along the thames river a 386foot smokestack rises from the 
hulking steel and concrete shell of a coalburning power plant 
under construction 
the owners applied energy services of arlington va and even 
environmentalists say the 275 million plant could set the 
standard for the environmentally sound production of electricity in 
the future 
the plant will burn about 2000 tons of coal a day when it 
begins operating in november relying on a combination of new 
technology and new ideas to limit pollution and offset the plants 
contributions to the greenhouse effect 
the most novel of the ideas is applied energys decision to 
spend 2 million to plant 52 million trees in guatemala in a 
reforestation project run by care an international relief and 
development organization 
the trees should absorb enough carbon dioxide which scientists 
blame as the main culprit in global warming to compensate for the 
14 million tons the plant will generate during its 40 years in 
operation the company says 
aes is setting the pace and helping to determine how their own 
industry will be regulated in the future theyve shaped the 
debate said paul faeth of the world resources institute a 
washingtonbased environmental research group working with applied 
energy on the reforestation project 
other utilities have expressed interest in similar projects 
faeth said 
daniel dudeck of the environmental defense fund in new york who 
favors requiring new carbon dioxide producers to compensate for 
their emissions said applied energy is demonstrating the 
feasibilty of such policies 
especially important environmentalists say is that the company 
is proof that private enterprise can take extraordinary steps to 
protect the environment and remain economically viable and even 
profitable 
applied energys stock has climbed from 2 to 135 during its 
eight years in operation the plant here is its fourth revenues 
during the past year were about 100 million when this plant and 
another under construction are running the company expects 
revenues of about 400 million 
its their whole corporate ethos they want to make money in 
the best way environmentally speaking they want as much as is 
technologically feasible to build an environmentally benign power 
plant faeth said 
in making electricity youve got a process that pollutes our 
objective was to see what we could do to minimize all types of 
pollution coming from the plant said dan rothaupt the plant 
engineer 
to keep sulfur dioxide part of acid rain out of the emissions 
limestone will be burned with the coal a reaction between the 
calcium carbonate and the sulfur in the coal forms calcium sulfate 
a harmless solid to accomplish this the plant uses a new 
technology the circulating fluidized bed boiler 
the boiler a steelencased tower 110 feet high lets operators 
maintain a temperature high enough to maximize the chemical 
reaction between the coal and limestone but low enough not to 
create many nitrogen oxides another pollutant 
the calcium sulfate and ash will be shipped back to west 
virginias coal fields where it will be used to reclaim land 
scarred by strip mining 
the process will remove 90 percent of the sulfur that goes into 
the boiler and produce about half the nitrogen oxides allowed by 
federal law the plant will generate 180 megawatts of electricity 
and sell steam to a paper mill 
profits arent really the ultimate goal for us its being a 
good neighbor being a good citizen said company president 
dennis bakke who founded applied energy with roger sant now 
chairman his former boss in the federal energy administrations 
environmental and conservation efforts 
we try to weigh that responsibility with trying to deliver a 
product to our customers which meets their needs

stock dealers in new york and chicago were slow 
to warm to the latest innovation in program trading of stocks 
but officials of the new york stock exchange and chicago board 
options exchange said they were satisfied with the lackluster 
firstday trading thursday of socalled stock baskets and 
predicted the new products would become accepted over time 
we had no real expectations of activity that we were aiming 
for said nyse spokeswoman sharon gamsin her exchange traded 
nine of the stock baskets thursday 
but critics said they had doubts about whether the baskets would 
ever catch on they cited bad publicity about program trading a 
strategy involving the simultaneous trading of a range of stocks 
that has been criticized as worsening stock market volatility 
all of the clients are telling us they dont like program 
trading we dont do it said brad weeks a senior vice president 
at donaldson lufkin amp jenrette securities corp 
the baskets essentially are portfolios that allow big investors 
to buy or sell in a single transaction every stock in the 
standard amp poors 500stock index that is aimed at investors who 
want to bet on the direction of the overall stock market without 
picking individual stocks 
investors bet on the overall market now mainly by trading 
stockindex futures and options in the chicago commodities markets 
at the nyse nine baskets were traded thursday at a price of a 
little more than 5 million apiece the chicago options exchange 
handled 14 trades of a cheaper version at about 17 million each 
trading began one day after the securities and exchange 
commission gave provisional sixmonth approval to the baskets 
the nyse sensitive to bad publicity about program trading said 
the baskets were introduced in response to a recommendation of the 
brady commission which investigated the october 1987 stock market 
crash 
its not something we designed to facilitate program 
trading ms gamsin said 
but one brady commission member robert kirby said he was 
unimpressed with the innovation 
the world needs another step toward the commoditization of 
common stocks like it needs an addition to the national debt 
said kirby chairman of capital guardian trust co in los angeles 
trading proceeded smoothly albeit slowly at the new york and 
chicago exchanges except for a miware glitch in nnor softew york 
several market makers and exchange officials said 
the spread between bid and ask prices the difference between 
what market makers will pay for a basket and what they will sell it 
for was narrower than it would be if each of the 500 stocks were 
bought separately making the basket a more efficient way to 
participate in the market according to matthew celebuski vice 
president of futures and options strategy at painewebber inc 
the efficiency of the baskets eventually should attract big 
investors such as pension funds and life insurance companies 
celebuski predicted nyse officials agreed 
we would hope that over time the nine baskets would become 20 
30 50 etc said donald solodar a senior vice president at the 
exchange 
the four firms making a market in the nyses version of the 
market basket which officially is known as the exchange stock 
portfolio were painewebber morgan stanley amp co first boston 
corp and salomon brothers inc 
painewebbers celebuski said he believed basket trading would 
slow the form of program trading known as index arbitrage by 
keeping stocks and futures closer in line 
the software glitch at the new york stock exchange prevented use 
of a mechanism by which investors could sidestep the four 
marketmaking firms and buy or sell a market basket by going 
straight to the specialists who make markets in the 500 stocks

a beer price war thats heating up across the 
nation has turned heads on wall street but the folks who ring up 
the sixpacks at the cash register arent impressed 
weve seen and heard these kinds of things over and over 
said don cowan a spokesman for the dallasbased southland corp 
which owns 7eleven the nations largest chain of convenience 
stores 
i think this is more like standard operating procedure 
cowan said thursday 
but the decision by anheuserbusch cos inc the worlds 
largest brewer to match price cuts made by competitors in an 
effort to shore up some declining markets did attract a great deal 
of attention from the financial world 
its going to be flatout war said julie neimann a 
securities analyst for st louisbased stifel nicolaus co 
there has been a beer war in this country for the past 18 
months but weve really tried to stay above the fray now we are 
joining the fray said jerry ritter a vice president and chief 
financial officer for st louisbased anheuserbusch 
talk of a beer price war was news to miller brewing co the 
nations secondlargest brewer 
our pricing and anheuserbuschs have not been significantly 
different this year susan henderson a spokeswoman for the 
milwaukeebased company said thursday 
the stroh brewery co ranks third among domestic brewers 
followed by adolph coors co and the g heileman brewing co last 
month coors said it signed an agreement in principle to acquire 
most of the beerrelated assets of stroh brewery 
the new anheuserbusch policy is going to mean slightly lower 
beer prices for consumers and fiercer competition for the nations 
beermakers according to market analysts 
the level of discounting in the beer business has been going 
up for some time but now anheuserbusch has said its coming out 
with both guns blazing said ben steinman executive editor of 
beer marketers insights a trade publication 
its too early to tell how much anheuserbuschs new policy is 
going to push down prices in the premium beer category but some 
analysts estimate consumers will save about a quarter on a sixpack 
sixpacks of budweiser miller genuine draft and coors generally 
cost about 350 although all companies offer frequent sales that 
drop the price below 3 in many areas of the country 
ritter said anheuserbusch decided to match price cuts by miller 
and coors because consumers have been buying budweiser and 
michelob the two main anheuserbusch brands at a slower rate in 
the past few months 
sales had been growing between 3 and 4 percent but now 
theyve slipped to a little below 3 percent we decided it was time 
to turn up the heat said ritter 
anheuserbusch which has been the countrys leading brewer for 
more than three decades sells about 42 percent of the beer in the 
united states it hopes to boost that to 50 percent over the next 
several years 
the new pricing strategy is certainly going to accelerate that 
growth at the expense of the nations other breweries said roy 
burry an analyst at kidder peabody amp co in new york 
the american beer industry has become much more competitive in 
the 1980s because beer sales have been increasing only slightly and 
per capita beer consumption has been going down 
the stepped up competition has led to an increase in the number 
of brands being sold by breweries and more promotion advertising 
and price cutting analysts said 
while anheuserbuschs new policy will be great for consumers 
advertising agencies and convenience stores analysts say the 
aggressive stance is going to hurt the rest of the industry which 
has been struggling 
the big question is whats going to happen to miller burry 
said 
miller has been enjoying one of its best sales years ever the 
company sold more beer in august than it ever sold in any other 
month said steve forsyth a miller spokesman

presidential airways inc which operates 
as a feeder service for united airlines at its washington dulles 
international airport hub has filed for protection from creditors 
under chapter 11 of the us bankruptcy code 
presidential which operates as united express remained 
operating thursday company president harold j hap pareti said 
however flights will be dropped in eight of the 24 cities the 
4yearold carrier served the west virginia cities of elkins 
morgantown and clarksburg hot springs va where service would be 
suspended normally tuesday columbia sc daytona beach and 
melbourne fla and salisbury md 
united airlines spokeswoman sara dornacker in chicago said 
united is cooperating fully with presidential and helping it 
make alternate travel arrangements for passengers who may be 
affected by the service suspensions 
we made these cuts really to maintain the bulk of our revenues 
and at the same time to size down the system so what were flying 
generates the maximum amount of cash at the lowest cost level 
pareti said 
as of today presidential expects to operate 64 daily flights 
compared with 75 wednesday pareti said 
the bankruptcy filing made in us bankruptcy court in 
alexandria gives us the opportunity to continue the 
restructuring of our company which began months ago he said 
steve dewey chairman of the pilots union at presidential said 
pilots signed a labor contract making wage concessions two weeks 
ago 
the company has been very candid with us and we were aware 
that the airline has had financial difficulties he said in a 
statement we did our part to help this company we are very much 
disappointed 
the move follows chapter 11 filings by two other airlines this 
year strikebound eastern airlines in early march and braniff inc 
in late september its second such filing in seven years 
according to court documents presidential had 30 million in 
assets and 76 million in liabilities as of june 30 the largest 
creditor aircraft maker british aerospace plc is owed about 26 
million for aircraft the court papers said 
debts during the first two years of operation totaled 70 
million pareti said 
were now at a point where we need to pay back these 
obligations he said we were not generating enough cash flow 
to run the daily operation and pay the past debt 
last month three vice presidents were dismissed and pay cuts 
were imposed on 709 workers the fulltime payroll was reduced by 
about 90 workers mainly through attrition pareti said 
presidential hired an investment banking firm in september to 
devise a plan to help the airline restructure its debt and find new 
sources of capital 
presidential began four years ago as a midsized carrier 
switched to a charter service and then to a feeder service for 
continental airlines which at the time maintained a hub at dulles 
however houstonbased continental gradually consolidated many of 
its flights in newark nj and closed its washington hub 
in january 1988 presidential became a feeder for united a move 
that has provided some economic security

the prices americans paid for imported goods 
fell 13 percent during the summer reflecting a stronger dollar 
and falling energy costs the government reported 
the labor department said thursday the price decline in the 
third quarter was identical to a 13 percent decline in same period 
a year ago falling oil costs played the major role in both price 
decreases 
in the latest quarter energy costs fell by 74 percent while 
imported food costs were down by 47 percent the price of imported 
chemical products fell by 22 percent 
the decline in food costs was the fifth drop in the past six 
quarters and marked the biggest decrease in three years it was led 
by a giant 386 percent decline in the price of coffee 
the overall moderation in prices was aided by a stronger dollar 
which lowers the costs americans must pay for imported products 
on the export side the price of american goods sold overseas 
dropped by 07 percent in the third quarter the biggest price 
decline since a 12 percent fall in the third quarter of 1986 
labor department analysts said that most of the decline stemmed 
from a 42 percent drop in agricultural exports reflecting lower 
grain prices 
nonfarm products edged down by 01 percent the first decline 
in this sector in more than three years 
allen sinai chief economist of the boston co said that the 
drop in nonfarm export prices was unusual given the big rise in 
the value of the dollar which makes americans goods more expensive 
on overseas markets 
he said us manufacturers apparently are shaving profit margins 
in an effort to hold onto foreign markets in the face of the rising 
dollar 
american companies are attempting to stay competitive in 
overseas markets by lowering their breakeven points by squeezing 
profits and cutting back on costs rather than raising prices

american telephone amp telegraph co can 
continue to offer special customized longdistance services to 
large accounts under its socalled tariff 12 rates the federal 
communications commission says 
the commission in a 40 vote thursday denied petitions by 
williams telecommunications group and the independent data 
manufacturers association for reconsideration of the fccs april 18 
order on tariff 12 
that order had allowed atampt to continue offering tariff 12 if it 
made it available to all similarly situated customers atampt made 
changes in the offering to comply with the fccs order and the 
commissions common carrier bureau approved those changes june 30 
thursdays action was a final denial of the challenges to tariff 
12 which atampt first offered to the defense department in 1985 
tariff 12 customers now include general electric co ford motor 
co and du pont co 
also on thursday the commission in another 40 vote found 
that atampts special tariff 15 rates for the nations largest hotel 
chain the holiday corp were illegal 
but the commission said the tariff was unlawful only because 
circumstances had changed since atampt made the offer in 1988 
atampt offered the holiday rate plan at discounts of 5 percent to 
10 percent off its pro america ii rates and justified the rates as 
a competitive response to a discount plan mci communications corp 
wanted holiday to buy 
but mci subsequently said its plan was available to all 
customers the fcc said that eliminated atampts claim that it needed 
to make a special competitive offering to just one customer in 
response to mcis bid 
federal rules require that atampt must make plans such as tariffs 
12 and 15 generally available to all similarly situated customers 
the fcc did not rule on whether tariff 15 was legal at the time 
it was filed which atampt construed as a victory 
the fcc rejected atampts tariff 15 proposal on a very narrow 
factual ground atampt said 
joe naccio atampts vice president for business communications 
services told reporters the company had offered tariff 15 to an 
indiana company resort condominium international and were 
going to honor that 
well file more naccio added we think the commission 
essentially affirmed our right to do that 
the commission made its determination even though an industry 
newsletter communications daily reported thursday that holiday 
corp was dropping tariff 15 in favor of another atampt offering 
fcc chairman alfred sikes also said he was ordering the 
commissions common carrier bureau to begin an inquiry into whether 
or not atampt should continue to be regulated as a dominant 
carrier 
atampt contends it no longer is dominant 
we agree emphatically with the fcc that the time is long 
overdue to take a look at the fierce competion in the longdistance 
business and the rules governing it atampt said

though several highly publicized attempts to 
take over major airlines failed recently and the industry is facing 
leaner times the wave of airline restructurings should continue 
airline officials and analysts say 
many airlines are predicting slimmer profits in coming months as 
fuel prices rise and the economy slows for the weaker players in 
the increasingly competitive environment the outlook is even 
dimmer 
on thursday presidential airways a feeder carrier for united 
airlines filed for protection from creditors under chapter 11 of 
the bankruptcy laws the move follows chapter 11 filings by two 
other airlines this year strikebound eastern airlines in early 
march and braniff inc in late september its second such filing in 
seven years 
braniff said thursday it had hired merrill lynch amp co to advise 
it on a possible sale of the beleaguered airline 
airline fuel costs are up 20 percent to 25 percent over a year 
ago according to edward starkman an industry analyst at 
painewebber inc 
were looking at a couple of tough quarters to come he 
said the numbers have withered and died in the last couple of 
weeks 
al frei senior vice president of finance at america west 
airlines says he expects passenger traffic overall to remain flat 
or grow only slightly next year 
were beginning to see a softening said bruce nobles 
president of trump shuttle the former eastern shuttle in the 
northeast that developer donald trump acquired this spring for 365 
million business travel is tightening up a little bit the 
airlines tend to lead a recession and follow a recovery 
nevertheless analyst starkman and others say the weakness 
wont have a chilling effect on takeover activity in the industry 
in fact starkman said investors who were going after airlines 
when their stocks were trading much higher now could see some 
bargains out there 
the takeover activity is going to continue even in the face of 
an uncertain at best stock market eastern president phil bakes 
said in an interview 
bakes is a former attorney for the civil aeronautics board who 
had been influential in drawing up the 1978 law deregulating the 
nations airline industry as one of the architects of 
deregulation he says he wasnt surprised by the pack of investors 
bidding for major airlines only by how long it took them to make 
their moves 
the panic selling that rocked the stock market this month was 
largely triggered by the breakdown of a 675 billion offer for 
united airlines parent ual corp from its pilots and top managers 
and while ual touched off the slide on wall street its stock price 
probably was the biggest casualty of the selloff 
ual stock has plummeted by more than 40 percent since oct 13 
when the pilotmanagement bid collapsed due to inadequate 
financing it closed at 17075 a share thursday on the new york 
stock exchange down sharply from 28525 on oct 12 
other airline stocks which also had been lifted by the 
takeover euphoria have followed suit 
another splashy airline deal trumps 7 billion proposal to buy 
amr corp parent of industry leader american airlines also was 
called off 
the failures come against a backdrop of growing anxiety in the 
bush administration and congress over airline takeovers 
despite the loss of altitude airlines remain hot properties 
because of their enormous cash flows and asset values bakes points 
out for example that healthy carriers like american and united 
own several billions of dollars in equity in new aircraft they have 
ordered 
some megadeals still seem to be going through notably an 
investor groups acquisition of nwa inc parent of northwest 
airlines for 4 billion 
and despite recent posturing by bush administration officials 
against leveraged buyouts of airlines including foreign carriers 
senior transportation and treasury department officials said this 
week that proposed legislation to restrict airline takeovers 
wouldnt be good for the industry or the economy

when ames department stores inc 
celebrated its acquisition of the zayre chain by officially 
renaming 254 zayre stores at least one town found something 
sinister about the changeover 
bloomfield officials say ames decision not to rename the local 
zayre could be interpreted as racist since ames officials 
acknowledge that the zayre stores retaining that name are 
patronized by metropolitan residents who might not be as loyal 
to an ames store 
officials in bloomfield where onethird of the population is 
black interpret that as a slap at minorities and they arent 
happy about it 
while some might defend the current decision as economic 
others are likely to characterize it more as racism and 
stereotyping mayor david a baram said in a letter to rocky

ribboncutting ceremonies were held thursday to celebrate the 
renaming and remodeling of 254 former zayre stores but the 
bloomfield store is one of 61 in the country and three in new 
england that are rentaining the zayre name the other two new 
england stores are in the roxbury and roslindale sections of 
boston both of which have large minority populations 
executives at ames which doubled in size when it bought the 
392store zayre chain for 778 million a year ago say market 
research indicated zayres name recognition was strong and 
favorable in the metropolitan areas where the switch wont be 
made mainly in chicago miami baltimore and washington dc 
ames socalled urbanmarket strategy means that in addition to 
not taking on the ames name the 61 stores will carry merchandise 
more suited to urban customers clothing and accessories for 
instance as opposed to products like lawn mowers and patio 
furniture said douglas ewing ames vice president for investor 
relations 
bloomfield officials complain that because the town north of 
hartford has a significant black population among its 20000 
residents ames officials decided to lump its store there with 
innercity stores serving a lowerincome clientel 
ames has decided to designate the bloomfield outfit as an 
urban outfit and they have made that distinction because they have 
suggested their patrons are primarily minorities and lowerincome 
people who are renters baram said they picked the wrong 
community 
the mayor described bloomfield as perhaps the most 
successfully integrated community in the state of connecticut 
with its population onethird black and onethird jewish along 
with a smattering of other minorities 
it is also one of the states most affluent communities ranking 
in the top 25 percent for percapita income in connecticut eighty 
percent of bloomfield families own their own singlefamily homes 
the residents here need and require lawn items snowremoval 
items things ames claims zayre doesnt sell because its patrons 
are residents who dont engage in mowing their lawns or swimming in 
their pools or playing tennis baram said 
ewing said shoppers at ames and zayre will find essentially the 
same items although zayre will offer expanded selections of 
apparel and accessories and a more limited assortment of the kinds 
of merchandise that metropolitan residents dont purchase as much 
ewing said the bloomfield store was the only one that produced 
objections for not taking on the ames name and merchandise 
the ameszayre consolidation looks to be a profitable one for 
the company ewing said ames now estimates it will save 40 
million by the end of the year because of the ameszayre 
consolidation compared with the 10 million it originally 
estimated he said

customers at mcdonalds restaurants in new england 
are being asked to separate plastic food containers from waste 
paper under a recycling effort that officials hope will spread 
across the country 
mcdonalds corp is undertaking the program with the national 
polystyrene recycling co a joint venture formed earlier this year 
by several leading producers of plastics including amoco chemical 
co dow chemical co and arco chemical co 
polystyrene products which are not biodegradable have received 
criticism around the country and more than a dozen cities have 
enacted bans on the plastic products 
but officials who spoke at a news conference thursday at a 
downtown mcdonalds said garbage problems cannot be solved simply 
by switching to more biodegradable materials 
where we have a shortage of space in landfills the solution 
lies in putting in less said shelby yastrow a mcdonalds senior 
vice president 
ken harman acting chairman of the joint venture and director of 
styrene products for dow said landfills inhibit all products from 
biodegrading so to put paper in instead of plastic you dont 
really accomplish anything 
the recycling venture has set a goal to recycle 250 million 
pounds of polystyrene per year by 1995 an amount equal to 25 
percent of the polystyrene produced annually in the united states 
for food service and packaging 
harman said new england is serving as the launch site for the 
program because the joint venture has acquired plastics again a 
recycling plant in the town of leominster 
here were ready he said we have a plant we have a 
capability 
the joint venture said it plans to establish four other regional 
recycling centers by the end of 1990 these centers are planned for 
chicago philadelphia southern california and the san francisco 
area 
under the program with mcdonalds restaurant customers will be 
asked to place their polystyrene foam hamburger containers 
utensils salad containers and hot drink and sundae cups in special 
trash bins marked for recyclable plastic only 
after the recyclable material is taken to the leominster plant 
it will be turned into plastic resins which will be sold to 
companies that manufacture plastic products 
customers are already being asked to separate their plastic 
waste at 100 mcdonalds restaurants in new england yastrow said 
and about 450 restaurants are expected to be participating by early 
next year 
based on initial tests mcdonalds expects 70 percent of its 
polystyrene waste products will be turned in for recycling yastrow 
said 
richard denison a senior scientist with the environmental 
defense fund said he was encouraged by mcdonalds efforts 
providing customers with an ability to recycle in their stores 
is an important first step denison said in an interview from 
washington dc 
but denison said the program could have limitations 
it only affects customers who eat in he said people who 
take materials out of the store would have to be awfully ambitious 
to participate in this 
mcdonalds officials estimate that at restaurants equipped with 
drivein windows 40 percent to 50 percent of its customers use 
that service 
but yastrow expressed hope that people who take their food away 
from the restaurants will separate their plastic items once they 
learn about the effort 
in fact officials said educating customers about recycling was 
a key part of the program 
we need to have more initiatives like the one were seeing 
today said paul keough acting regional administrator for the 
us environmental protection agency i hope that its wildly 
successful and will be copied around the country 
tom tomaszek general manager of plastics again in leominster 
noted that next month the town of sturbridge is scheduled to start 
what is believed to be the first community program for separating 
polystyrene products 
national polystyrene recycling officials hope more communities 
will initiate such efforts after the other four regional plants are 
completed 
the proposed sites were chosen based on strong support in those 
regions for recycling programs tomaszek said

the dollar was higher in calm european trading 
early today and the pound was stabilizing after its tumble due to 
chancellor of the exchequer nigel lawsons resignation 
gold prices moved up 
the sharp drop in the pound signaling disarray in the british 
financial markets after the cabinet revolt thursday helped the 
dollar as traders switched funds from the british into the us 
currency dealers said 
it was a signal to favor the dollar over the pound said one 
dealer at a us bank in frankfurt 
another trader at a french bank in frankfurt said the move into 
the dollar was a logical first reaction because it is the most 
liquid currency where investors seek refuge in times of turmoil 
but i believe the move is more a technical reaction and wont 
last he said next week we should go weaker again 
but we have to wait to see whether this was an overreaction 
thursday or means a sustained weakness in the pound he said 
traders said the bank of england may have intervened in the 
market to support the pound 
another dealer at a west german bank said lawsons replacement 
by john major wont mean a change in british monetary policy which 
is likely to remain very tight 
but some traders said the resignation has triggered a deep 
crisis for prime minister margaret thatcher and will further 
undermine the trust of the financial markets in the soundness of 
british economic policy the falling fortunes of thatchers 
government coupled with the huge british current account deficits 
could prompt a further decline in the pounds value they said 
in tokyo where trading ends before europes business day 
begins the dollar rose 085 yen to a closing 14275 yen later in 
london it was quoted at a lower rate of 14263 yen

the resignation of the british treasury chief sent 
the pound plunging and the dollar rising against the japanese yen 
today while share prices on the tokyo stock exchange fell sharply 
dealers said 
the dollar closed at 14275 yen up 085 yen from thursdays 
finish and 062 yen higher than the new york finish overnight 
after opening at 14202 yen it rose to the days high of 14315 
yen in early afternoon trading 
currency dealers said japanese market players were selling 
british pounds and buying dollars resulting in the dollars 
relative bullishness against other currencies including the 
japanese yen 
masafumi koyama a bank of tokyo trader said dollaryen trading 
was light but the dollar was bought actively against the 
widespread selling of the british pound following british 
chancellor of the exchequer nigel lawsons resignation 
lawson prime minister margaret thatchers treasury chief and 
her personal economic adviser sir alan walters resigned thursday in 
a dramatic government shakeup 
on the stock market the 225issue nikkei stock average lost 
15190 points or 042 percent to close at 3552729 
the markets main barometer opened slightly higher but the 
instability in the currency market and a poor showing in wall 
street gradually pushed the index downward 
securities dealers attributed the nikkei index decline to a 
40point fall in the dow jones industrial average of 30 major 
issues in new york overnight but they did not say it was caused 
directly by the news from london 
the instability in the currency market doesnt seem to bother 
stock investors because they are aware that it is only dollarpound 
business said a dealer at nikko securities co speaking on 
condition of anonymity 
he added however that market players share the view that share 
prices have reached an excessively high level and that is 
causing most shares to ease downward 
another dealer at a major japanese securities firm said 
construction shares which have been the driving force of the 
recent rally in the tokyo market were mostly bearish because of 
the markets general sentiment that construction shares are higher 
than their acceptable level

the airplane mechanics who helped scuttle an 
employee buyout of ual corp say they are willing to compromise 
with united airlines pilots on an employee ownership stake to 
prevent an outside takeover of the company 
the machinists union favors a restructuring of ual but if we 
have to get into some kind of ownership we want minority ownership 
just to keep the raiders out john peterpaul vice president of 
the international association of machinists and aerospace workers 
said thursday 
separately the buyout group led by the pilots and ual 
management reiterated its intention to revise its bid for the 
airline 
also thursday ual reported its third quarter earnings were down 
sharply from 1988 partly because of a 586 million charge related 
to the botched buyout bid and partly because the yearearlier 
period included a 393 million gain from the sale of uals share of 
a computerized reservations system 
the vehement opposition of the machinists to employee ownership 
was seen as a factor in the failure of the 675 billion buyout 
plan the 300 a share proposal collapsed two weeks ago when the 
buyout group which also included british airways plc failed to 
secure financing 
uniteds flight attendants joined forces with the group after 
british airways dropped out last week 
ual stock which had plunged by more than 40 percent since the 
plan collapsed rose 975 a share to 17075 thursday on the new 
york stock exchange 
the price drop since the buyout groups oct 13 announcement 
that it could not get financing has raised speculation that a 
raider might attempt to buy up ual shares to mount a takeover 
attempt 
leaders of the machinists which represents uniteds mechanics 
and groundcrew workers met thursday with financial advisers to 
review the situation 
peterpaul said before the meeting his union was ready to 
consider anything to get this company out of play and back into 
the real world 
ultimately if we have to get into a posture between us and 
the pilots to protect the airline and protect the jobs of 
employees i think we can reach a spirit of compromise 
peterpaul said in a telephone interview from washington where the 
meeting was held 
frederick dubinsky chairman of the united pilots union has 
said the pilots still would like majority ownership by the 
airlines employees but would settle for some form of control over 
the airline perhaps through supermajority voting rights 
financial advisers to uniteds pilots and flight attendants met 
separately in new york on thursday to fully explore the issues 
and options said kathie hardin a spokeswoman for the united 
chapter of the air line pilots association in chicago 
in a statement issued late thursday the pilotmanagement group 
said it was reviewing the situation with a view toward revising 
its transaction and proceeding with the employee acquisition of ual 
corp 
the statement said the group expected to have a proposal ready 
for the ual board in the near term 
the flight attendants union represents about 14000 united 
employees compared with 7000 workers represented by the pilots 
union and 25000 by the machinists 
uals top management was a 10 percent partner in the failed 
buyout bid but chairman stephen wolf said monday he was returning 
his attention to running the airline apparently at the urging of 
uals board of directors 
the board decided monday not to sell the company for the time 
being while it explores other ways to increase shareholder value 
in its earnings report ual posted a profit of 1108 million 
or 511 per share down from 4024 million or 1868 a year 
earlier 
excluding the 393 million gain from the sale of its interests 
in the covia reservations system uals profit in the yearearlier 
period was 179 million or 831 per share 
revenue during the quarter rose to 26 billion from 24 
billion in third quarter 1988 
earnings also were depressed by a 586 million charge for stock 
appreciation rights stemming from the surge in uals stock after 
billionaire marvin davis made a buyout proposal that later was 
countered by the pilotmanagement groups bid 
davis later withdrew his offer but said he remained interested 
in ual 
for the first nine months of the year ual posted a profit of 
3174 million or 1466 a share compared with 11 billion or 
3435 per share a year earlier ninemonth revenue rose to 74 
billion from 675 billion

britains new treasury secretary is expected to 
pursue mostly the same economic policies but london financial 
markets were rocked today by the news of revolt in prime minister 
margaret thatchers cabinet 
the new chancellor of the exchequer john major was named to 
the post thursday night after nigel lawson abruptly resigned 
saying he couldnt continue to serve as long as mrs thatcher 
retained her economic adviser sir alan walters walters resigned 
himself several hours later 
financial markets were hit hard by the government upheaval the 
pound plummeted late thursday sank in early trading today and then 
stabilized while stock prices skidded today before recovering some 
of their losses 
the bank of england which normally does not comment on its 
activities appeared to have intervened in the foreign exchange 
market today to support the pound dealers said 
the markets were concerned about uncertainty and feared that the 
government again would push up interest rates which already stand 
at an eightyear high of 15 percent even higher interest rates 
would worsen fears of a recession in britain 
mrs thatcher told reporters outside her 10 downing st office 
today that government policies would continue precisely as they 
were despite lawsons resignation 
she expressed regret at his departure citing his enormous 
achievements but said her new appointees were all experienced 
the pound traded at 15790 in late morning today compared with 
a low of 15620 earlier in asian trading and 16130 in london 
before lawson resigned thursday 
on londons stock exchange the financial timesstock exchange 
100stock index was down 335 points or 16 percent at 20959 at 
midday after having been down nearly 44 points earlier in the 
session 
the market was already very uncertain about the economy and 
this has just worsened matters said andrew smith a british 
equities analyst at laing and cruikshank 
lawsons resignation will be very damaging to the market 
said charles larkum an analyst at the london investment firm james 
capel and co the focus will now be on sterling and whether uk 
base interest rates will have to rise 
major on thursday quickly vowed to continue prime minister 
margaret thatchers fight against resurgent inflation with high 
interest rates 
but economists said they doubted major would see a strong pound 
as key in the fight against inflation as lawson did 
the pounds decline reflects the disappearance of the lawson 
premium said nigel richardson an economist at the london 
investment firm warburg securities 
it takes the floor from under sterling said gavyn davies 
an economist with goldman sachs international in london 
major who was first secretary of the treasury before being 
named foreign secretary in july said in his statement i 
strongly supported the governments economic and monetary policies 
when last at the treasury and i still do 
inflation is the most damaging problem we face and its defeat 
remains our overriding objective he said 
monetary policy is tight and is beginning to have its 
effect he added i shall keep it tight for as long as 
necessary 
so far this year britains annual inflation rate has more than 
doubled to its current 76 percent and the countrys trade deficit 
ballooned to the equivalent of 31 billion from 23 billion at the 
same time a year ago 
the government has increased official interest rates 11 times 
since june 1988 bringing them from a decade low of 75 percent to 
15 percent their highest level in eight years 
the latest interest rate increase on oct 5 of a full 
percentage point was made in line with a west german interest rate 
increase 
the british move was attacked as excessive by the governments 
critics who warned that it could push britain into a recession 
but the government stood by its interest rate increases which 
are designed to curb consumer spending and borrowing 
economists said there were likely to be far fewer doubts about 
majors allegiance to mrs thatchers policies than there were 
during lawsons 6 years at the treasury 
mrs thatcher has been more faithful to freemarket principles 
in regard to foreign exchange movements than lawson who believed 
in the benefits of a strong and stable exchange rate 
stability could be achieved by tying the pound to the exchange 
rate mechanism of european monetary system which links eight of 
the common markets 12 currencies and limits their movements 
lawson believed 
but mrs thatcher believes the pound should be linked only after 
britains inflation comes down to the level of inflation in other 
european countries and capital flows freely in europe 
walters who had public disagreements with lawson has been a 
staunch proponent of allowing sterling to float to its natural 
level

warning shock jocks that they will be fined if they broadcast 
indecent material during daytime hours 
the commissions mass media bureau thursday issued 20000 in 
fines against four radio stations and said it was investigating 
four others for alleged indecent broadcasts 
the bureau under new chief roy stewart also eliminated a 
backlog of 87 indecency complaints built up during the last two 
years under former fcc chairman dennis patrick 
fiftyone cases against 40 stations were dropped because the 
purportedly indecent material was broadcast after 8 pm and 36 
others were dropped because of defective complaints or inadequate 
proof of violations said bill johnson deputy chief of the mass 
media bureau 
thursdays action was another indication that the commission 
under chairman alfred sikes will crack down on indecent programming 
between 6 am and 8 pm since sikes took over in august the fcc 
has issued warnings to three radio stations and fined another 
2000 
sikes and his three fellow commissioners also voted thursday to 
launch an inquiry into establishing a 24hour ban on indecent 
broadcasting congress ordered last year 
a court stayed implementation of the fcc rules in january and 
in september ordered the agency to conduct a study to justify the 
ban 
the commission defines broadcast indecency as language or 
material that depicts or describes in terms patently offensive 
as measured by contemporary community standards for the broadcast 
medium sexual or excretory activities or organs 
it will take action when there is a reasonable risk that 
children may be in the audience the fcc said 
congress specifically ordered a ban to protect children and in 
its announcement thursday the commission said it would consider 
children to be age 17 and under 
the stations cited thursday and their fines were 
wiod miami licensed by cox broadcasting 10000 for five

four other stations were given 30 days to respond to complaints

mike disney general manager of wiod told the miami herald i 
liken it to the starship enterprise going into a time warp and 
suddenly the rules are different since al sikes has come in as 
fcc chairman its been a tremendous shift to the right

fact is that this is i think censorship and this would not stand

amid a wave of buyouts by japanese companies 
overseas a british company surprised the japanese public friday by 
announcing plans to take over sansui electric co a wellknown but 
financially troubled japanese audio manufacturer 
sansui agreed to a friendly takeover by the british conglomerate 
polly peck international plc sansui president ryosuke ito told a 
news conference 
ppi is to purchase 51 percent of sansui shares by buying 39 
million shares which are to be newly issued in early january in 
addition to 376 million shares currently held by other 
shareholders he said 
the british company will pay some 157 billion yen the 
equivalent of 111 million buying sansui shares at 400 yen or 
280 per share 
after thorough examination we have decided the tieup with 
ppi polly peck international will be the best way to restructure 
our company ito told reporters 
at the end of october 1989 sansui had a cumulative debts 
amounting to 138 billion yen mainly due to our failure in 
management to overcome the worsening external environment and tough 
competition with other makers he said 
the deal made frontpage news in major japanese evening 
newspapers friday and prompted lively comment 
amid a recent wave of mergers and aquisitions of foreign 
companies by japanese firms this is the first case in which a 
major japanese company is being saved by a foreign company wrote 
yomiuri shimbun the nations largest newspaper 
with the british companys help sansui hopes boost profits by 
starting production of vcrs to enter the audio visual equipments 
market while further developing its audio products sansui said in 
the statement 
sansui has been financially in trouble since 1985 largely due

prime minister margaret thatcher said today she 
will not change the economic policies that led to the treasury 
chiefs resignation and plunged her government into possibly its 
worst crisis 
britains financial markets were rocked by news of the revolt 
thursday the pound plummeted late thursday sank further early 
today then stabilized stock prices in their first chance to 
react dove this morning before recovering some of their losses 
the new chancellor of the exchequer john major was named to 
the post thursday night after nigel lawson abruptly resigned 
saying he could not continue to serve as long as mrs thatcher 
retained sir alan walters as her economic advisor walters resigned 
shortly afterward he did not give a reason 
major said thursday he will continue mrs thatchers fight 
against resurgent inflation with high interest rates which already 
are at an eightyear high of 15 percent 
mrs thatcher told reporters outside her office today that 
government policies will continue precisely as they were 
despite lawsons resignation 
she expressed regret at his departure citing his enormous 
achievements but said her new appointments were all very 
experienced ministers 
we have an excellent new team and it will be business as usual 
and we shall go steadily forward she said later at a public 
appearance 
the government says there is no alternative to high interest 
rates to fight inflation and maintains the problems of inflation 
and record trade deficits are improving 
critics say the policies have pushed britain to the brink of 
recession and many in the public seem to agree 
the government trails the socialist opposition labor party by up 
to 10 percentage points in opinion polls the next general 
election however is not due until mid1992 
labor party leader neil kinnock in a bbc interview today 
blamed the crisis on the utter incompetence of the prime 
minister 
the times of london which normally supports mrs thatcher said 
she faced her biggest crisis since taking power in 1979 
crisis for thatcher the conservative daily telegraph 
reported 
the independent reported government in turmoil nigel 
lawson last night delivered margaret thatcher the biggest blow of 
her decade in office and shook the conservative party to its 
roots 
it said some members of parliament have secretly discussed the 
possibility of a leadership challenge after the new parliamentary 
session opens next month 
but senior conservative leaders echoed party chairman kenneth 
baker who dismissed any suggestion that mrs thatchers position 
was at risk 
she has been in many difficulties and come through them 
successfully there is not an economic crisis the economy of the 
country remains very strong baker said in a british broadcasting 
corp radio interview 
major said after his new appointment that fighting britains 76 
percent annual inflation remained the governments overriding 
objective monetary policy is tight and is beginning to have its 
effect i shall keep it tight for as long as necessary he said 
lawson 57 increased interest rates to 15 pecent in a bid to 
choke off cost of living increases and prop up the pound on world 
markets 
he held the job since 1983 engineering tax cuts and an economic 
recovery he and mrs thatcher appeared in close harmony as long as 
the boom lasted but when it began to falter 18 months ago reports 
of discord surfaced 
the two were said to disagree over the currency with lawson 
advocating a managed exchange rate and mrs thatcher insisting it 
be left to the mercy of market forces 
lawson also was thought to favor britain joining the european 
monetary system a mechanism for stabilizing exchange rates mrs 
thatcher favors joining only after british inflation declines and 
capital flows freely in europe walters opposed joining europe and 
criticized lawsons policies 
lawson said in his resignation letter the successful conduct 
of economic policy is possible only if there is and is seen to be 
full agreement between the prime minister and the chancellor of 
the exchequer 
recent events have confirmed that this essential requirement 
cannot be satisfied so long as alan walters remains your personal 
economic adviser home secretary douglas hurd the cabinet member 
responsible for law and order became foreign secretary david 
waddington chief government business manager in parliament became 
home secretary no replacement was announced for walters

lin broadcasting corp said today it has revised 
its plans to merge its cellular telephone operations with bellsouth 
corp in a move evidently designed to thwart a buyout bid by mccaw 
cellular communications inc 
the announcement provides another twist in what has already 
proven to be a contorted series of moves begun last june when mccaw 
launched an unsolicited takeover bid for lin a new yorkbased 
cellular telephone and television company 
lin offered no estimate of the value of its revised plan 
however under the new proposal lin said it intended to give 
its shareholders a special cash dividend of 42 per share before 
the merger of cellular operations up from an a 20 per share cash 
dividend under an earlier plan 
lin said it was able to pay a higher dividend because bellsouth 
the regional telephone company based in atlanta agreed to 
contribute more assets to the mereger of cellular interests than 
originally envisioned 
lin also said it intended to exercise its right of first refusal 
to buy metromedia cos 46 percent interest in a cellular franchise 
serving new york city for 19 billion 
lin already owns most of the rest of that franchise and mccaw 
cellular had recently offered 19 billion to buy metromedias 
interest 
one element of the original plan that remains unchanged is that 
lin shareholders would still get stock in a new broadcasting 
company comprising lins television station interests that are to 
be spun off the lin shareholders would also get stock in the new 
cellular company 
mccaw the cellular telephone industry leader has been pursuing 
lin since june and has offered 275 billion for 22 million of 
lins shares in a deal that would give mccaw controlling interest 
in lin 
donald a pels president anfd chairman of lin said in a 
statement the revised agreement with bellsouth is clearly 
superior to mccaws coercive twotiered offer

regulators who tried to close lincoln savings 
and loan association say the thrifts millionaire owner fought back 
as late as this spring with political influence reaching the 
highest levels of government 
william j crawford commissioner of the california department 
of savings and loans told the house banking committee on thursday 
that two attempts were made from washington on behalf of phoenix 
businessman charles h keating jr to approve the sale of lincoln 
to a group of investors 
crawford never approved the sale described as a sham by 
federal regulator william black 
within weeks of the calls the irvine califbased sampl was 
taken over by the federal deposit insurance corp and is expected 
to require a 2 billion bailout making it the nations costliest 
thrift failure 
carolyn jordan an aide to sen alan cranston dcalif urged 
approval of the sale in march in april according to crawford 
sen dennis deconcini dariz called crawfords boss business 
transportation and housing secretary john geoghegan 
crawford said deconcini called at the instigation of the top 
federal thrift regulator m danny wall 
in an 8hour hearing crawford and san franciscobased 
officials of walls agency the office of thrift supervision 
detailed keatings threeyear effort to deter them from bringing 
enforcement action against his institution 
the effort included what they characterized as secret meetings 
in 1987 between keating and wall as well as the enlistment of five 
senators to plead lincolns cause and the hiring of federal reserve 
board chairman alan greenspan then a private economist as a 
consultant to defend the thrifts financial condition 
michael patriarca the thrift offices chief supervisory agent 
in san francisco and black counsel in that office had 
recommended in may 1987 that the government seize lincoln to end 
reckless activities and prevent further losses 
their recommendation was rejected and in an unprecedented move 
the case was transferred from the san francisco office to agency 
headquarters in washington patriarca and black said that delayed 
action by two years 
if our recommendations had been followed the taxpayers 
would have suffered dramatically smaller losses black said it 
need not have happened and would not have happened if regulators 
in washington had showed any backbone 
rep henry b gonzalez dtexas chairman of the banking panel 
said he would ask president bush to have wall take administrative 
leave during the hearings 
gonzalez complained that wall by having a thrift office lawyer 
meet earlier this month with patriarca and black was attempting to 
influence their testimony 
in other developments 
gonzalez revealed that shortly after the fdic took over lincoln 
the agency discovered that telephones in an office used by 
california state sampl examiners had been rigged so that others in 
the institution could eavesdrop on the examiners confidential 
conversations 
an fdic memo released by the committee said the matter was 
referred to the fbi for criminal investigation 
leonard bickwit a washington attorney representing keating 
said corporate officials deny authorizing or participating in phone 
tampering 
patriarca revealed that in an apparent attempt to influence 
him his wife laura patriarca then an attorney with the thrift 
office was offered a job with american continental 
testimony by patriarca and black illustrates keatings wide 
political reach which included persuading five senators whose 
campaigns he had helped fund to meet with regulators on his behalf 
in april 1987 
the five are cranston deconcini john mccain rariz john 
glenn dohio and donald w riegle jr dmich 
patriarca and black said the bank board under wall seemed more 
protective of keatings interests than of its own field staff 
without informing regulators in san francisco or asking for their 
side of the story they said wall and other bank board officials 
met dozens of times with keating 
in 1984 and 1985 when keating was fighting a bank board effort 
to restrict direct commercial and real estate investments by 
thrifts he enlisted the help of greenspan who in a very 
influential letter distributed to members of congress described 
lincoln as a strong institution black said 
patriarca black and crawford appeared at the second of four 
scheduled hearings on lincoln keating and wall are scheduled to 
appear nov 7

grain and soybean futures prices were mostly 
lower in early trading today on the chicago board of trade 
reflecting disappointment in the low level of export sales this 
week 
although the agriculture department announced sales of 100000 
metric tons of corn to south korea and 25000 tons of wheat to 
algeria this morning traders said those transactions were 
insignificant compared to the several million tons of us grain 
the soviet union bought last week 
despite the relatively slack demand this week export sales of 
us corn and soybeans are running well ahead of last year and some 
experts believe prices are headed higher in the long run 
on any good breaks buy some for your grandmother advised 
john frazier an analyst with balfour maclaine corp in chicago 
in early trading wheat futures which closed at fourweek lows 
thursday were cent lower to cent higher with the contract for

the federal budget deficit declined slightly 
to 1521 billion in fiscal 1989 mostly because the government 
spent only half as much as expected on savings and loan bailout in 
august and september it was announced today 
the budget gap for the fiscal year ending sept 30 represented a 
31 billion improvement over the 1552 billion in red ink 
recorded in 1988 
the deficit had hit a record 2211 billion in 1986 before 
declining to 1497 billion in 1987 as the grammrudman deficit 
reduction law pressured the administration and congress into 
holding down spending 
however since then progress has stalled and 1989 marks the 
third consecutive year of essentially the same budget gap 
in august the government projected a 1672 billion budget 
deficit for the fiscal year but the red ink came in under 
projections the government had planned to spend 188 billion on 
savings and loan rescues but spent only 91 billion said a joint 
report by the treasury department and the office of management and 
budget 
the new agency created aug 9 for sampl bailouts the resolution 
trust corp was unable to complete the sale of five large sampls 
before sept 30 that will shift those expenditures into the 
current fiscal year inflating the 1990 deficit 
in september the government spent 1054 billion and collected 
revenue of 992 billion producing a deficit of 62 billion in 
september 1988 the government recorded a surplus of 102 billion 
spending in the 1989 fiscal year totaled 114 trillion while 
revenues added up to 9908 billion 
according to economists one factor inflating the 1989 budget 
gap was the timing of military pay farm supports and social 
security benefits those monthly payments normally occur on oct 1 
the first day of the new fiscal year 
but because that date fell on a sunday the checks were issued 
the previous friday pushing about 10 billion in spending into 
fiscal 1989 
also noteworthy in fiscal 1989 was the fact that interest on the 
28 trillion national debt surpassed social security spending for 
the first time 
as usual the largest spending category was defense which 
totaled 278 billion in september and 2949 billion for the year 
up 46 percent from 1988 
interest on the national debt was 163 billion last month and 
2409 billion for the year up 125 percent from the previous year 
social security spending totaled 192 billion for the month and 
2275 billion for the year a 62 percent increase 
spending in the department of health and human services for 
programs other than social security added up to 154 billion last 
month and 1723 billion for all of 1989 an 84 percent rise from 
1988

japanese airline union officials on friday said the 
introduction of a new passenger jet with a crew of two instead of 
the conventional three members would lead to a great reduction of 
safety 
their appeal made at a news conference in tokyo marked the 
latest round in a battle between the flight crew unions federation 
of japan and japans three major airlines over purchases of the new 
plane 
japan air lines has announced it will buy 20 of the new boeing 
747400s widely thought to be the nextgeneration jet plane and 
all nippon airways is planning to purchase another 24 
the main advantage of the 747400 is its fuelsaving features 
which allow the plane to fly 930 miles farther than conventional 
747s 
but the new plane also features an advanced computer system 
which boeing co says makes it possible to fly the 747400 with 
only two pilots and no flight engineer the pilots union says the 
omission of the third person is dangerous 
the twoman cockpit design has extensively reduced information 
for ackowledging the condition of the systems and airframe of the 
aircraft also greatly reduced are the tools necessary for 
coping with a malfunction said tetsuo kimura a flight engineer 
for japan air lines 
but geoffrey tudor director of jals public relations said the 
airline had done everything possible to ensure the planes safety 
weve asked boeing for certain guarantees that their work is 
going to be performing to the best possible standards of safety 
as requested by the pilots tudor said 
he denied that japan air lines purchase of the new planes was 
part of a plan to cut its workforce said to be one of the highest 
paid in the world for an airline former flight engineers who lose 
their jobs will be sent to a training school to become pilots 
tudor said 
no ones going to be laid off thats not the managements 
intention at all he said 
tetsuya muranaka general secretary of the flight crew unions 
federation denied that union opposition to the new aircraft was 
connected to the potential unemployment of union members 
it is not related to the livelihood of the pilots it is a 
matter of our lives and the lives of the passengers he said 
muranaka said the unions goal was not to prevent the airlines 
from purchasing the new planes but to force them to make the 
planes safer he added that the unions might resort to strikes if 
necessary 
after japan air lines released a video last year advertising the 
new plane the flight crew unions federation spent 3 million 
japanese yen or around 21000 to put together its own hourlong 
response 
the federation has since filmed another shorter video aimed at 
a general audience a japanese press report said japan air lines 
was considering filming another video to respond to those made by 
the federation

boeing co announced plans friday for a 
reorganization of military and space exploration work to cut losses 
on defense projects and reduce overhead costs on government work 
generally 
boeing spokesman paul binder said the organizational changes 
were largely a matter of redrawing flow charts and executive 
assignments without any change in job assignments or employment 
level at any plant 
many details however have been left to be determined by a 
transition team and there is no target level for savings binder 
said 
he added that a productionhalting strike that began oct 4 by 
the international association of machinists and aerospace workers 
was not a factor in the reorganization 
last year boeing reported 125 million in profits on missiles 
and space systems chiefly the aerospace and electronics division 
and losses of 95 million on military transportation products and 
related systems covering most of the other affected divisions 
effective jan 2 a defense and space group will cover boeing 
military airplanes in wichita kan boeing aerospace and 
electronics and boeing advanced systems both in seattle boeing 
helicopters near philadelphia and argosystems of sunnyvale 
calif near san francisco 
all of boeings commercial airplanes are assembled in seattle 
and the surrounding communities 
boeing work in wichita is being reorganized under a wichita 
branch covering military work and a wichita division of boeing 
commercial airplanes 
work done in wichita now performed under the heading of boeing 
military airplanes is actually 53 percent devoted to production of 
components for the 737 747 757 and 767 commercial plane airframes 
boeing advanced systems will be renamed boeing military 
airplanes with jurisdiction over the wichita branch 
this unified organization structure will increase the 
management focus and facilitate performance improvements in certain 
overhead elements of our current defense and space activities 
boeing chairman frank shrontz said in a prepared statement 
with the moves binder said boeing would be in a better position 
to land what is expected to be a dwindling number of military and 
space exploration contracts 
he denied the changes involved any switch in emphasis between 
boeings commercial side which has recorded record sales and 
profits in recent years and the less successful military side 
we are trying to make ourselves more competitive in the market 
both markets he said 
boeing senior vice president b dan pinick who serves as 
president of aerospace and electronics was named president of the 
group by shrontz 
john dempster chief design engineer for boeing military 
airplanes was named vice president of that division and general 
manager of the new wichita branch 
cg king currently president of boeing advanced systems 
becomes president of boeing military airplanes 
robert dryden now president of boeing military airplanes was 
named head of the wichita division and executive vice president of 
boeing commercial airplanes

mobil corp said friday that a previously 
announced reorganization of its us operations would involve the 
reduction of approximately 400 employees nationwide 
the countrys second largest oil company behind exxon corp said 
the biggest reduction would come from slashing the staff in its 
denver office from 430 people to 105 
charles e spruell president of mobils exploration and 
production unit said the changes would be concentrated in 
operations responsible for drilling wells and pumping crude and 
natural gas 
the cutbacks are scheduled to begin in a few weeks and will 
continue over several months mobil said 
mobil disclosed the reorganization tuesday calling it part of 
an effort to cut costs and improve profits in the united states 
where depressed oil prices have made exploration and drilling much 
less profitable 
offices in dallas houston new orleans and midland texas 
also will lose workers said mobil spokesman john lord while 
offices in bakersfield calif liberal kan and oklahoma city 
will gain some 
mobil has 69500 employees worldwide including 5000 in its 
us exploration and production units 
in its thirdquarter earnings report on tuesday mobil said it 
had taken a 40 million provision for the restructuring costs 
mobil reported a 4 percent decline in net income compared with 
the 1988 third period 532 million or 130 a share vs 557 
million or 136 a share revenue totaled 136 billion up 4 
percent from 131 billion a year earlier 
analysts said mobils restructuring reflects an industrywide 
reshuffling of assets because of declining us output domestic 
production fell by more than 500000 barrels a day during the first 
nine months of this year

the treasury department said today it will 
borrow 17 billion on an emergency basis early next week so it can 
pay social security benefits to 389 million retirees and avert an 
unprecedented government default 
treasury secretary nicholas brady said thursday the emergency 
borrowing will enable monthly social security checks to go out on 
schedule nov 3 regardless of whether congress breaks a deadlock 
and passes an increase in the national debt limit 
senate majority leader george j mitchell dmaine today 
denounced the emergency auction as obviously a transparent 
political move to enhance the effort to get a capitalgains tax 
cut there apparently is no limit to what theyll do to reach 
that goal 
republicans will attempt to attach the capitalgains reduction 
to a bill extending the debt limit because of stiff opposition of 
democratic leaders that effort is likely to result in a filibuster 
that would delay a vote on the debt bill 
announcing the details of the debt auction today the treasury 
department said it will speed up the issuance of 156 billion in 
threemonth and sixmonth bills they will be auctioned on monday 
as scheduled but issued on tuesday rather than thursday also on 
monday the treasury will auction 2 billion in 51day cash 
management bills to be issued the next day 
treasury officials went forward with the borrowing after 
congressional leaders were not forthcoming with assurances that 
congress would be able to pass an extension of the debt legislation 
before the midnight tuesday deadline when the current 287 
trillion debt ceiling drops to 28 trillion 
bradys announcement came in a letter to house republican leader 
robert michel 
brady said in his letter that the government will have 17 
billion in borrowing authority left on monday which he will use to 
raise cash in the financial markets before the tuesday deadline 
a treasury official briefing reporters on condition that his 
name not be used called the emergency borrowing unprecedented and 
said it will cost the government money through higher interest 
rates that will have to be paid on the debt due to the hurryup 
nature of the borrowing announcement 
the official said however that brady decided to go forward 
with the borrowing because he did not feel he had any choice the 
alternative the official said would have been an unprecedented 
default by the government on its obligations 
the emergency borrowing will only enable the government to 
scrape by until nov 7 when it will again run out of money 
at times of other debates over extension of the debt ceiling 
the government has been able to function for several days after 
hitting the borrowing limit essentially on a cash basis where it 
meets its routine obligations out of tax revenues it receives on a 
daily basis 
the house last spring passed an increase in the debt ceiling to 
31 trillion however the measure has yet to clear the senate 
where it has been bogged down in debate over a host of unrelated 
matters such as the proposed cut in the capital gains tax

ford motor co has raised its stake in british 
luxury car maker jaguar plc to 132 percent jaguar said friday 
ford which had held 124 percent of jaguar now owns 242 
million ordinary jaguar shares 
meanwhile general motors corp said it had won us regulatory 
approval to buy up to 15 percent of jaguar the two automakers are 
in the midst of negotiating an operating agreement that may involve 
general motors taking a minority stake in jaguar 
jaguar chairman john egan has said he hopes to announce a deal 
with gm by midnovember 
ford announced last month that it planned to acquire 15 percent 
of jaguars stock and received regulatory approval for the 
purchase in a filing this week with the securities and exchange 
commission ford said it was prepared to bid for all outstanding 
jaguar stock when takeover restrictions are lifted at the end of 
1990 
jaguar bylaws prevent any outside individual or company 
acquiring more than 15 percent of its stock before dec 31 1990 
jaguar has spurned fords overtures saying it favors a 
cooperative agreement with general motors that would allow it to 
maintain its independence 
a gm spokesman said the company received early clearance for its 
stock purchase from the federal trade commission which must 
approve major share acquisitions under the scottrodino act 
gm said it had no further comment on its plans

wall street was stunned bond brokers froze 
doomsayers talked of financial disaster 
that was the scene a year ago as the biggest takeover battle of 
all time consumed rjr nabisco inc when it was over the investment 
firm kohlberg kravis roberts amp co had defeated the food and 
tobacco giants top management paid a record 2453 billion in 
borrowed money and put the company heavily into debt 
critics of the 1980s takeover era said rjr nabisco would be 
crushed by the weight of its debt load and jeopardize the banks 
that financed the deal the bond market already reeling from a 
rash of highpriced takeovers was traumatized because investors 
thought the buyout binge had gone too far 
what a difference a year makes 
despite a debt of 23 billion rjr nabisco now is seen as a 
relative rock of stability while the financial markets are buffeted 
with uncertainty raised by smaller takeovers 
i think the company is doing tremendously well said kurt 
feuerman a securities analayst at drexel burnham lambert inc 
jack maxwell of wheat first securities in richmond va said 
its a good company and theyve got a good team 
investors also praise the new rjr nabisco confidence in the 
company was evident in the recent performance of the companys 
highyield junk bonds that were used to finance the takeover 
prices skidded on the highyield market after other big buyouts ran 
into trouble recently rjr nabiscos didnt 
there are two reasons why 
because of the nature of rjr nabiscos business the company is 
considered inherently more stable than other companies investors 
also have confidence in its management 
the biggest worry for highly leveraged companies like rjr 
nabisco is cash flow without a strong steady influx of money 
they cant pay their interest bills 
several buyouts have stumbled because cash flow hasnt matched 
projections the most notorious case has been campeau corps 66 
billion takeover of federated department stores inc a wobbly 
transaction that jolted the stock and bond markets a few weeks ago 
because campeau couldnt pay its interest 
kohlberg kravis the acknowledged leader of debtfinanced 
takeovers played no role in the campeaufederated problem but 
some of its financial deals have faced difficulty for example its 
360 million buyout of seaman furniture co had to be refinanced 
no one expects that to happen at rjr nabisco because the 
companys products are considered recession proof even in 
hard times people would still eat oreos and smoke camels 
they have a predictable cash flow generating capability which 
exceeds interest expense and capital expense said michael 
dahood a bond market analyst the stability of the enterprise is 
not threatened by debt expense 
the companys rj reynolds tobacco co along with other 
tobacco firms has lost market share to industry leader philip 
morris cos inc in recent years but the analysts see little cause 
for concern 
tobacco profits should grow 15 percent his year and another 20 
percent next year said drexels feuerman noting that profit 
growth from overseas sales is also in the range of 20 percent 
analysts and investors say theyre satisfied with the way rjr 
nabisco chairman louis gerstner has handled the company since he 
arrived there from american express co eight months ago 
they particularly like the prices hes gotten for assets rjr 
nabisco has sold to help repay its debt load 
the company has sold five european food businesses for 25 
billion its chun king division for 52 million its associated 
biscuits international ltd for 44 million del monte fresh fruit 
operations for 875 million del montes canned food business for 
148 billion and most recently its baby ruth butterfinger and 
pearson candy businesses for 370 million 
the sold divisions wont cost rjr nabisco that much business and 
what they have left is very strongly positioned feuerman said 
rjr nabisco must still dispose of some 230 million in assets to 
reach its goal of 55 billion in divestitures there are some 
smaller parts of the company that were exploring at this point 
but the company does not plan to shed any major divisions gerstner 
said in an interview 
individual product lines are the most likely to go 
maxwell the wheat first analyst said he was pleased by cost 
and inventory reductions and by the companys plans for boosting 
tobacco sales in recent years rj reynolds has turned around its 
oncelagging camel brand and is focusing on revitalizing winston 
and salem sales maxwell said 
the battle for rjr nabisco marked a quantum leap in the scope of 
the takeover trend reshaping american business for the first time 
it seemed to raise the possibility that any company could be 
acquired with borrowed money 
the company announced on oct 20 that its chief executive f 
ross johnson was considering a bid of about 17 billion 
that kind of money was beyond comprehension on wall street but 
four days later kohlberg kravis announced a 2025 billion offer 
signaling the start of a bidding war that for a while included the 
investment firm first boston corp 
the rjr nabisco fight not only dwarfed all records for 
takeovers it came against a background of brawls for two other big 
food companies 
just days before philip morris had launched an 11 billion 
offer for kraft inc and pillsbury co had rejected a 523 billion 
bid from the british firm grand metropolitan plc 
in both cases the suitors won and late in the evening of nov 
29 rjr nabisco announced that kohlberg kravis had emerged the 
winner 
johnson was vanquished but still rich from a severance package 
and the sale of his own rjr nabisco stock when he resigned in early 
february he took several top rjr nabisco managers with him but 
analysts said they were satisfied with gerstners replacements 
kohlberg kravis is also said to be happy with rjr nabiscos 
performance the investment firm is smarting from seamans problems 
and reports that it has been disappointed by other investments and 
its reputation rests on the outcome of its biggest takeover 
for gerstner the outside worlds obsession with the size of the 
takeover is irrelevant its running the business thats most 
important 
youve got to separate that financial transaction from the 
great marketing strength and production strength of this company 
he said

britains financial markets were buffeted friday 
by the political storm over the abrupt resignation of prime 
minister margaret thatchers treasury secretary 
the markets were jolted by uncertainty over the governments 
exchangerate policy and were highly nervous that a resulting steep 
decline in the british pound would prompt the government to push up 
interest rates above their 8year high of 15 percent 
the pound ended at 15750 in london friday up from a low of 
15620 earlier in asian trading but down from 16130 in london 
thursday before chancellor of the exchequer nigel lawson resigned 
on the london stock exchange the financial timesstock exchange 
100stock index fell 473 points or 22 percent to close at 
20821 near its session low 
higher interest rates would increase the growing chances of a 
recession in britain already suffering from the highest interest 
rates and inflation among the major industrialized countries 
thats obviously the big fear at the moment said anthony 
thomas an economist with the london investment firm kleinwort 
grieveson securities 
said keith skeoch economist at james capel and co thats 
going to be touch or go whether we go to 16 percent 
he added were pretty close to a recession here at the moment 
anyway 
mrs thatcher declared friday that it was business as usual 
and that she would continue her economic policies 
a new chancellor of the exchequer john major was named to the 
post thursday night after lawson abruptly resigned after six and a 
half years in the position 
belatedly on friday evening the treasury issued the text of a 
speech major was to make later saying i favor a firm exchange 
rate but most of the days trading had wound down by then 
lawson an elected member of parliament said he couldnt 
continue to serve as chancellor as long as mrs thatcher retained 
her economic adviser sir alan walters walters also resigned 
thursday several hours later 
lawsons departure forcing a cabinet shuffle in the face of a 
deteriorating economy is mrs thatchers biggest crisis since 
coming to power in 1979 the british press and her critics say 
some of londons investment firms stayed open all night thursday 
to trade the pound and shares because the news of lawsons 
resignation came after the stock market closed 
the bank of england intervened in the foreignexchange market 
friday to support the pound dealers said the british central bank 
normally does not comment on its market activities the us 
federal reserve was reported intervening late in the london day to 
help support the pound 
but the bank of england refrained from pushing up interest 
rates for the time being by leaving its moneymarket rates 
unchanged 
analysts said the government was in a difficult position an 
interestrate increase could signal and cause panic but 
standing pat could encourage the pound to slide further and that 
might fuel inflation just what mrs thatcher wants to avoid 
the government is falling over itself to emphasize this is not 
a crisis thomas said if they put up interest rates its 
tantamount to admitting it is a crisis 
analysts complained that they werent sure of what majors 
currency policy was lawson believed a strong pound was key to 
fighting inflation and supported managing exchange rates walters 
believes in freefloating rates 
britains annual inflation rate has more than doubled to its 
current 76 percent the countrys trade deficit ballooned to the 
equivalent of 31 billion so far this year from 23 billion at the 
same time a year ago 
the government has pushed up interest rates 11 times since june 
1988 bringing them from a decade low of 75 percent to 15 percent 
their highest level in eight years 
clearly the next week or 10 days is going to be a very 
uncertain period until that confidence is established in the 
market thomas said

soybean futures prices closed moderately lower 
friday on the chicago board of trade amid expectations for an 
active harvesting weekend in the southeast and the mississippi 
delta region 
corn futures also fell while wheat futures finished mixed 
with most of the midwestern corn and soybean crops now in the 
harvest is moving south dry weather is expected in southern 
soybean areas this weekend which should allow the fieldwork to 
move along rapidly 
a lack of significant export business limited buying interest in 
the grain markets analysts said 
although the agriculture department announced overnight sales of 
100000 metric tons of corn to south korea and 25000 tons of wheat 
to algeria traders said those transactions were insignificant 
compared with the several million tons of us grain the soviet 
union bought last week 
nevertheless export sales of us corn and soybeans are running 
well ahead of last year and some experts believe prices are headed 
higher in the long run 
on any good breaks buy some for your grandmother advised 
john frazier an analyst with balfour maclaine corp in chicago 
at the close of trading wheat futures were cent lower to 2 
cents higher with the contract for december delivery at 398 a 
bushel corn was 2 cents lower to cent higher with december at 
242 a bushel oats were 1 cents to 2 cents lower with december 
at 143 a bushel soybeans were 1 cent to 5 cents lower with 
november at 562 a bushel

the sagging real estate market in new england is 
causing trouble for the regions banks which competed to lend 
money during a building boom earlier this decade but now have seen 
many loans go bust 
everyone was caught up in the euphoria of the market and they 
didnt remember that what goes up will also come down said leo 
spang senior vice president in the real estate division at shawmut 
bank in boston 
the result of the downturn will be lower stock prices and 
earnings for shareholders and more reluctance by banks to finance 
real estate projects experts say also analysts predict that some 
small financial institutions could be forced to shut down 
this real estate correction is going to take a pound of flesh 
from most banks and thrifts said gerard cassidy a banking 
analyst with tucker anthony inc in portland maine 
in recent weeks the regions largest banks have been wounded 
because of shaky real estate loans 
moodys investors service lowered its ratings for both bank of 
boston and bank of new england in both cases citing the weakened 
real estate market 
for example bank of boston reported that in new england it has 
around 400 million in nonperforming commercial real estate loans 
meaning developers are having trouble making payments 
to cover the bad loans bank of boston shifted money into its 
reserves and reported a 125 million loss in its last quarter 
its clearly a problem company spokesman wayne taylor said 
otherwise the bank would not have reported its biggest loss in 
history 
similar news came this week from smaller banking companies 
heritage bancorp of holyoke mass and one bancorp of portland 
maine both reported that their nonperforming assets had grown 
sharply and as a result they took losses for the quarter 
the banks that were really players are all experiencing 
difficulty said vincent furey jr president and chief executive 
officer of one bancorp 
analysts say these losses can be blamed on natural cycles in the 
real estate market but also on a failure by many banks to see that 
the cycle would change 
things were straight up cassidy said everyone was having 
a great old time 
the real estate fortunes mirrored growth in the regions 
economy which boomed in the mid1980s but problems began when the 
economy started to weaken because many commercial developments 
were already in the works but still needed tenants 
its not the boom times said michael manzo president of 
the greater boston real estate board the demand for office space 
is off job formation job growth is not what it was 
with office buildings and condominiums having a hard time 
finding tenants many developers have had trouble paying off their 
loans the result is that banks are now struggling with some loans 
that they should not have approved analysts say 
a lot of banks were competing for developments and some of 
them got into poor lending practices said james moynihan senior 
vice president of advest inc in boston 
banking officials defend their past lending practices but they 
also say they have tightened the current availability of loans 
the fact is there are not many new deals out there said 
spang at shawmut bank developers are not moving forward on 
speculative products and banks wouldnt approve them anyway 
analysts say banks could feel bad effects from the real estate 
market for another couple of years until the excess commercial 
space is absorbed 
but that does not mean new construction is dead developers can 
still get financing for projects that have minimal risks said 
wayne clough vice president of boston financial group 
the old days of speculative building are gone he said 
but theres still a good appetite for wellsponsored deals

the dollar weakened substantially against all 
major currencies except the british pound friday undermined by 
another poor session in the us stock market and expectations of 
lower interest rates 
sterling stayed stuck in the slump it lapsed into when the 
british governments top finance official abruptly quit on thursday 
gold prices gained sharply on the commodity exchange in new 
york gold bullion for current delivery settled at 37830 a troy 
ounce up 580 from thursday the republic national bank of new 
york quoted an ounce of gold at 37725 as of 4 pm edt 615 
higher than thursdays late bid 
the dollar ended near its lowest levels of the day currency 
dealers said selling motivated by internal market factors

lin broadcasting corp and bellsouth corp said 
friday they had agreed on a revised plan to merge their cellular 
telephone interests in a deal that would create the nations 
largest cellular operation 
the deal which will be presented to lin shareholders for a vote 
in december or january could prompt revision of a pending buyout 
bid for lin from mccaw cellular communications inc the current 
leader in the cellular field 
a key element of the revised plan is a boost in the special cash 
dividend lin plans to pay its shareholders before the merger to 
42 per share or 226 billion from a 20 per share under the 
initial merger plan 
lin also said it had exercised its right of first refusal to buy 
metromedia cos 46 percent interest in a cellular franchise 
serving new york city for 19 billion mccaw had bid for that 
interest but lin as the holder of most of the rest of the 
franchise had the right to match mccaws offer 
mccaw based in kirkland wash is bidding for a controlling 
interest in lin and said it was extending its offer until midnight 
nov 17 the offer had been set to expire at midnight friday 
we believe the revised bellsouth offer still raises more 
questions than it answers mccaw said in a statement it urged 
lins directors to conduct a fair auction on a level playing 
field 
analysts said they doubted the latest linbellsouth plan was the 
last word in what has become an increasingly complicated battle for 
lin 
it is difficult to compare the value of the competing plans 
patrick jurczak telecommunications analyst for merrill lynch amp 
co said he valued the linbellsouth deal at 118 a share to 120 
a share for lin stockholders compared with 113 a share under the 
latest mccaw bid 
joel gross telecommunications analyst for donaldson lufkin 
jenrette securities corp valued the bellsouth offer at 117 to 
124 a share compared with 110 to 112 a share under the mccaw 
offer 
it puts the ball back in mccaws court gross said we had 
always said this would be a multipart game 
in national overthecounter trading lin rose 462 a share to 
11262 while mccaw fell 250 a share to 3775 bellsouth fell 
87 cents a share to 5212 in trading on the new york stock 
exchange 
the battle for lin a new yorkbased cellular concern which also 
has seven television stations and a specialty publishing operation 
began in june when mccaw launched an unsolicited takeover bid 
lin rejected the offer but later agreed to merge its cellular 
operations with those of bellsouth the regional telephone company 
from atlanta that wants to extend its reach in the cellular 
business 
mccaw then revised its buyout bid and offered 125 a share for 
22 million of lins shares combined with the 51 million shares 
mccaw already owns the stake would give mccaw 503 percent of 
lins 54 million shares 
both the mccaw and the bellsouth deals contain provisions under 
which those companies could acquire the remainder of the stock in 
the cellular company several years down the road 
lin chairman and president donald a pels said friday the 
revised linbellsouth proposal is clearly superior to mccaws 
coercive twotiered offer 
the plan calls for lin and bell to merge their cellular 
operations in a new company in which lin shareholders and bellsouth 
each would have a 50 percent stake executives said the deal could 
be completed in the first quarter of 1990 after securing regulatory 
approval 
bellsouth made payment of the higher special cash dividend to 
lin shareholders possible by agreeing to contribute about 800 
million less debt to the new cellular company than originally 
envisioned 
the lin shareholders will also get stock in a new company that 
is being created by the spinoff of lins seven television stations 
lin officials valued that broadcasting company at between 12 and 
15 a share 
counting the additional interest in the new york cellular 
franchise the combination of lin and bellsouth cellular operations 
would have a potential audience of 549 million that would 
displace mccaw as the cellular leader it has interests in cellular 
companies with a potential audience of 50 million 
bellsouth said it would pay up to 10 a share in five years to 
lin shareholders who continue to hold stock in the cellular company 
if certain appraisals indicate they could done better under the 
mccaw proposal

dow jones amp co inc said friday it had extended 
until nov 6 its 576 million offer for the 33 percent stake in the 
electronic financial information company telerate inc that it does 
not already own 
dow jones which publishes the wall street journal and provides 
an array of electronic business services of its own had previously 
said its 18ashare offer for the telerate stock would expire at 
midnight friday nov 3 
but dow jones said it was extending the offer until 5 pm 
eastern time monday nov 6 because it is mailing a supplement to 
its offer to telerate shareholders and wants to give them ample 
time to review it 
the statement said the supplement does not otherwise amend the 
terms and conditions of the offer 
a committee of independent directors of telerate rejected the 
offer as inadequate earlier this month and urged dow jones to meet 
with them to achieve a mutually agreed upon transaction that 
would be fair to all telerate shareholders 
dow jones said its representatives met with members of the 
special committee of telerate on thursday to discuss the offer but 
said those discussions did not result in any changes to the terms 
of the offer 
a dow jones spokesman declined to say how many shares had been 
tendered so far under the 18ashare offer 
in trading on the new york stock exchange friday telerate fell 
50 cents a share to 20

have described the four golf iiclass soviet subs as dated and 
virtually useless 
the proposal also received a lukewarm reaction from neighboring

gorbachevs proposal was interesting but should be studied 
closely before drawing conclusions said sten andersson foreign 
minister of the neutral nation 
swedish opposition leader carl bildt said the golf iiclass 
vessels were the oldest rustiest and most scraggly subs in the 
world 
gorbachev departed for home friday after a fourhour tour of

mcdonnell douglas corp the nations largest 
defense contractor reported thursday a 54 percent decrease in its 
thirdquarter profit reflecting continued problems in both its 
commercial and govenment segments 
the company earned 38 million or 98 cents a share compared 
with 83 million or 218 a share in the same quarter a year ago 
revenue was 37 billion up from 368 billion in the yearago 
period 
the current quarters figures include 6 million or 14 cents a 
share in earnings from discontinued operations in the information 
systems area 
for the first nine months of the year the company had a profit 
of 159 million thanks to a 179 million onetime gain as a result 
of an accounting change without that gain the company would have 
had a 26 million loss for the period 
sales for the first nine months totaled 1032 billion almost 
the same as the figure for last years first nine months 1033 
billion 
the principal factors cited for the lower earnings in the 
quarter were a jump in interest expense to 95 million from 57 
million a year earlier an operating loss in the commercial 
aircraft segment and decreased earnings from the combat aircraft 
missiles space and electronic systems segments 
the commercial aircraft segment lost 3 million on revenues of 
13 billion in the quarter compared with earnings of 15 million 
on revenues of 13 billion last year 
the company attributed the loss to parts shortages and problems 
arising from the need to assimilate and train a large number of new 
workers a major reorganization was also a factor mcdonnell 
douglas said 
theyve gone through a major restructuring in douglas aircraft 
and theyre doing the same now in helicopters said phil 
friedman an analyst with drexal burnham lambert inc 
analyst paul nisbet of prudentialbache securities inc said the 
third quarter figures troubled him 
theyre a lot better than the first two quarters nisbet 
said but still not near the level that one would consider 
normal i suspect that a lot of it is continued problems with 
research and development
