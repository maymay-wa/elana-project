the mayor of sweetwater three city council members 
were indicted thursday by a federal grand jury on extortion 
charges the us attorney announced 
mayor irain gonzalez and council members carmen menendez hugo 
alvarez and antonio duran are accused of using their public 
positions to extort money from a local businessman who wanted them 
to reverse a landuse restriction said us attorney dexter 
lehtinen 
public corruption by elected officials strikes at the heart of 
democracy lehtinen said 
five of seven members of sweetwaters city council were 
involved in this extortion attempt he alleged he apparently 
counted gonzalez who is a council member as well as mayor and one 
of two other council members not included in the indictment 
gonzalez menendez alvarez and duran each face a maximum of 40 
years in prison and a fine of 500000 lehtinen said 
lehtinen said he notified gov bob martinez of the indictment 
thursday and that the governors office would decide who will run 
the city of sweetwater 
the governors press secretary jon peck said martinez has yet 
to make a decision on the matter he said the governor was awaiting 
written confirmation of the indictment 
were aware of the situation and our attorneys are still 
looking at it peck said 
the other two city councilmen manuel avila and lucio cobian 
have cooperated with lehtinens office and have agreed to testify 
on behalf of the government he said 
cobian has agreed to plead guilty to one extortion charge and 
avila is an unindicted coconspirator lehtinen said 
the indictment stems from a request made by maurice barakat in 
june 1989 asking the council to lift a landuse restriction 
barakat who owns the holiday plaza shopping center had sold part 
of the land which left him with less than the five acres necessary 
for commercial zoning 
barakat asked the city council to remove the restriction so he 
could sell the additional commercial units more easily the 
indictment said the defendants allegedly told barakat he would 
have to pay them 10000 in exchange for a favorable council vote 
on his request 
instead barakat went to the fbi 
the councilmen voted to continue delaying action on barakats 
request until he paid the money the indictment alleged barakat 
paid menendez 5000 with fbi agents watching but then was asked 
to pay 6000 more according to the indictment 
the city officials are expected to surrender friday through 
their attorneys and make their first appearance in federal court 
friday afternoon lehtinen said 
sweetwater known in the 1960s as a rural outpost in western 
dade county has recently become a haven for political exiles from 
central america

the federal filed suit thursday against the 
state of nevada claiming the state is acting illegally in refusing 
to issue environmental permits for work on the proposed nuclear 
dump at yucca mountain 
the us district court suit also asks that legislative 
resolutions and a state law banning the dump be declared invalid 
because they are preempted by a congressional directive to conduct 
scientific studies of the site 
state officials have adamantly opposed any plans for work at 
yucca mountain which congress picked in late 1987 as the nations 
only site to be studied for a highlevel radioactive waste dump it 
would be used to store spent fuel rods from commercial nuclear 
reactors 
the department of energy said in november it planned to file the 
suit the action asks a judge to order state officials to issue the 
necessary permits within 30 days and prohibit the state from 
unlawfully interfering with the does activities at the site 
we have tried to work with the state over the years but 
unfortunately they have refused to cooperate in that area said 
carl gertz the nuclear dump project director we were forced 
into filing this suit so we can move ahead with scientific 
studies 
the department of justice suit was seen as unusual by attorneys 
who said it was rare that the federal government would sue a state 
for trying to block federal law 
usually its the other way around said doe attorney dave 
gassman but the federal program must prevail it is a very basic 
issue 
in december the state attorney generals office filed suit 
claiming the state has the right to bar the doe from following 
congresss mandate because the nevada legislature has passed 
resolutions disapproving the yucca mountain site 
the state contends it has the right under the federal 
legislation to veto the site and is also bound by a law passed by 
the 1989 legislature that makes it illegal to put a nuclear waste 
dump in nevada 
the 21page suit filed in us district court in las vegas is 
seen by doe officials as the only way to get the much delayed 
project back on track 
in november the agency announced it was revamping its schedule 
for the controversial facility and would open it in the year 2010 
seven years later than planned 
gertz said the doe needs to get the state permits and begin 
exploratory drilling and other scientific work at the site by next 
january to even be able to keep current with the revised schedule 
state officials in december returned the air and water permits 
to the doe unprocessed saying state law precluded them from 
granting permits to build the dump the doe originally applied for 
the permits in january 1988

black and hispanic inmates armed with 
homemade knives brawled at an overcrowded county jail thursday and 
12 were injured before guards restored order officials said 
one prisoner at the el cajon detention center was critically 
injured said jail commander ben mclaughlin 
he said the fight began about 430 pm between black and 
hispanic inmates at the jail 15 miles east of san diego where a 
similar racially motivated fight left four inmates injured dec 13 
inmates retreated to their cells when deputies entered the 
cellblock armed with electric stun guns a weapon that fires rubber 
bullets inmates were armed with handmade knives and other crude 
weapons mclaughlin said 
the brawl attributed to overcrowding and racial tensions 
occurred in a cellblock designed to hold 24 inmates but which held 
100 prisoners when the riot broke out mclaughlin said 
deputies saw a black inmate and a hispanic inmate arguing 
moments before their confrontation erupted into a largescale 
brawl mclaughlin said 
in this case it was blacks vs hispanics mclaughlin said 
i was a racial issue but were not sure yet what sparked it it 
just erupted without warning 
one injured inmate was transported by helicopter to sharp 
memorial hospital where he was listed in critical condition with 
head injuries said hospital spokeswoman melanie bruce she 
declined to release the inmates name 
two other inmates suffering head injuries were admitted to 
university of california san diego medical center said 
spokeswoman jane swett one was in serious condition and the other 
in fair condition she said declining to release their names 
at least nine other inmates suffering cuts scrapes and other 
minor injuries also were taken to various east san diego county 
hospitals for treatment 
it took deputies about 15 minutes to get the prisoners into 
their cells before deputies regained control of the cellblock 
mclaughlin said 
there is no damage to the cells they were really injuring 
themselves mclauglin said 
deputies with guard dogs were stationed around the jail exterior 
as a sheriffs helicopter with a spotlight circled overhead to 
guard against any possible escapes 
the detention facility is designed to hold 120 but housed 
slightly more than 500 prisoners thursday

for the sake of a 20yearold leukemia victim 
about 9600 people have undergone blood tests in the past three 
months hoping that they will be able to give her the bone marrow 
that might save her life 
allison atlas is still waiting but as a result of her search 
for a compatible donor eight other patients have found potential 
donors and a data bank that collects information about possible 
donors is nearly 10000 names richer 
the atlas family of bethesda md is among about 15 families 
around the country who have gone public with marrow searches 
helped by a national organization 
the families travel talk to reporters hold donor drives and 
raise money to cover the 75 blood test fee for each volunteer they 
bring in public relations and fundraising pointers come from the 
lifesavers foundation the recruiting arm of the national marrow 
donor program in st paul minn 
help save allisons life entreats an advertisement that has 
brought volunteers to synagogues and jewish community centers in 
washington baltimore boston new york harrisburg pa norfolk 
va and other cities 
each ad features a photo of the new york university business 
major ms atlas 20 sometimes appears at the bloodtesting 
centers along with her parents and siblings 
several people have come up to me and said i hope im the 
one said ms atlas its reinforced in my mind that we are 
going to find someone 
its been a very emotional experience for the whole family to 
see all these people waiting in line said her father alvin 
atlas 
were private people its been a very difficult thing to 
do said atlas a clothing store owner but one of our goals is 
to save our daughters life the doctors dont know how much time 
we have 
doctors told ms atlas in august that her type of leukemia can 
only be cured by a transplant to replace diseased marrow which 
produces new blood cells members of her family and 75000 listings 
at the national marrow donor program did not match her tissue type 
the odds of a match are usually about 1 in 20000 it was 
determined that her best chance for a match was among people who 
shared her eastern european jewish ancestry a group the donor pool 
was largely lacking in november friends of allison started a 
flurry of donor drives at jewish institutions 
similarly inspired groups are working to enlarge the donor pools 
for asianamerican greekamerican and other ethnic groups 
the family of judie davis in oakland calif is targeting 
africanamerican donors were concerned because we might be 
running out of time for her said liz quam a spokeswoman for the 
donor bank 
dr rudy brutico a pediatrician and founder of lifesavers 
said it helps the cause when a picture of a leukemia victim reminds 
wouldbe donors of mom or cousin joe they identify with it he 
said 
if a match is found between a potential donor and a patient the 
donor is asked to consent to a transplant doctors remove 1 pints 
of marrow from the donors pelvic bone under general anesthesia 
the recipient gets the marrow in a blood transfusion and the marrow 
cells lodge in the spongy interior of large bones 
when the donor bank marked its first transplant on dec 15 
1987 it was then considered highly experimental said ms quam 
since then the bank has arranged about 266 transplants about 
threequarters had leukemia 7 percent had aplastic anemia and the 
rest had other blood diseases doctors wait five to seven years 
before pronouncing a cure but all are doing well said ms quam 
ms quam said one patient has survived 19 years with a 
transplant from a relative another has lived 17 years with a 
transplant from a nonrelative 
brutico of west covina calif founded lifesavers in 
september 1988 to help the donor bank find a match for his wife 
diana a mother of four who had leukemia mrs brutico found two 
matches got a transplant and no longer shows signs of the disease 
my wife would be dead or dying in despair without the 
goodness of some other person said brutico 
since then lifesavers has tested 50000 volunteers entering 
their names and tissue type in the donor bank and raised 35 
million 
this year the national donor bank will begin to link up with 
similar computers in other countries the goal is a donor pool of 1 
million worldwide by 1995 officials said

reputed mob boss john gotti was described as 
gods gift to the underworld in tapes secretly recorded by law 
enforcement agents and played wednesday to jurors at his assault 
and conspiracy trial 
prosecutors say gotti 49 became boss of the gambino crime 
family largest of new yorks five mafia factions in december 1985 
after thenboss paul castellano was gunned down in front of a steak 
house 
transcripts of the tapes which were released to the news media 
show gotti concerned about keeping underlings including lifelong 
friends in their place 
at least once on the tapes gotti uses the term cosa nostra 
when he is apparently telling an unidentified man that mob soldiers 
should not address him directly on business matters but should go 
through their capos or captains 
the tapes also indicate a relationship with the westies a 
vicious irishamerican gang that operates on manhattans west side 
the westies are a key factor in gottis trial with associate 
anthony guerrieri 60 on charges of assault and conspiracy in the 
1986 revenge shooting of john f oconnor former vice president of 
a carpenters union local 
gotti is accused of commissioning the westies to shoot and wound 
oconnor because the union leader had thugs trash a restaurant 
owned by gotti associate philip philly modica 
the transcripts show at least one mention by gotti of the 
restaurant and several comments on the westies 
at one point gotti says theyre doing something for me them 
irish guys but does not say what 
at another point gotti refers to james coonan as my friend 
who is the leader of the west side gang irish guys he also 
says hes on the payroll and he gets it legitimately 
the tapes were introduced by edward wright an investigator with 
the states organized crime task force 
wright said the alleged mobsters suspecting they might be under 
surveillance turned on hair dryers flushed toilets whispered and 
used other means to try to make conversations inaudible 
the tapes were made from listening devices placed in gottis 
hangout in the borough of qeens and monitored by police between 
june 19 1985 and feb 26 1986 
more than 1000 cassettes were recorded prosecutors say 
one 1986 tape shows gotti in a telephone conversation quoting 
someone who praised him when they say gods gift to the 
underworld you are it 
he speaks with his heart gotti said on the telephone he 
means it i tell ya something i love the guy 
on another tape gotti expressed annoyance with lifelong friend 
angelo ruggiero for his familiarity during business hours 
i told ange you gotta forget them liberties you take take 
em when were alone gotti said 
gotti apparently had just made ruggiero a caporegime or 
crew captain according to the tape transcripts and was not 
satisfied that his friend was acting like a leader 
ruggiero a defendant in the oconnor case with gotti died of 
natural causes last month

the house voted overwhelming wednesday to 
override president bushs veto of legislation protecting chinese 
students from deportation while bush appealed to republican 
senators to resist and help him keep open ties to the worlds most 
populous nation 
the house vote of 39025 sent the matter to the senate where 
both sides said the outcome of thursdays scheduled vote was in 
doubt 
weve got a fighting chance bush said wednesday night at a 
state dinner for the president of north yemen 
house speaker thomas s foley declared i dont think whats 
most on the minds of the members of congress is the sensitivities 
of the present chinese leadership this is a leadership that 
has in our judgment failed to respect the rights of its own 
citizens 
on the issue of china the president has lost his 
credibility said rep stephen solarz dny chairman of the 
house foreign affairs asia subcommittee 
bush pinned his hopes on the senate where both democratic and 
republican senators predicted a cliffhanger the president 
national security adviser brent scowcroft and secretary of state 
james a baker iii all were telephoning senators through the day 
bush was publicly appealing to gop senators to support him in 
the face of what he termed crass politics played by some 
supporters of the override 
but the chief house sponsor of the legislation california 
democrat nancy pelosi said she hoped senators would resist the 
fullcourt press by the white house 
why would he ask a senator to vote against human rights and 
principles she asked after the house vote 
the legislation would affect as many as 32000 chinese students 
now in the united states on exchange visitor visas the bill 
would waive a legal requirement that those students return home for 
two years after their visas expire before returning to the united 
states or going elsewhere 
in addition the bill would permit any chinese student whose 
visa has expired as many as 8000 others to remain in the 
united states as long as danger exists at home and would allow 
chinese students to work while in this country 
bush vetoed the measure on nov 30 after it had passed 
unanimously in the house and by a voice vote in the senate chinese 
student groups have lobbied hard for an override of the veto 
saying many of them would face political persecution at home 
because they supported the prodemocracy demonstrations that 
brought a violent government crackdown last june 
a group made up of chinese students hailed the house vote as 
an historic victory for human rights in china 
we are hopeful that the strong support in the senate will be 
enhanced by the house vote said haiching zhao of the independent 
federation of chinese students and scholars which represents 
42000 chinese students at more than 200 us colleges and 
universities 
at the time bush vetoed the bill he ordered government agencies 
to adopt what he contends are essentially the same safeguards the 
veto was simply an effort to preserve executive branch foreign 
policy prerogatives he said and to keep open the door for future 
student and cultural exchanges 
i will not break faith with the chinese students here 
they were safe then and they are safe now and they will be safe 
in the future bush told a white house news conference wednesday 
to the 37 gop senators who attended a breakfast at the white 
house bush hit hard on his contention that a veto override would 
mean a total cutoff of the flow of students to the united states 
and he appeared to be winning a few converts 
the price of the pelosi bill is lost opportunity for the 
chinese scholars of tomorrow the president told reporters later 
the bill is totally unnecessary the longterm policy 
consequences are potentially great and congress in my view will 
have only itself to blame 
bush listed steps the beijing government has taken which he said 
justified his policy toward china the lifting of martial law in 
the capital the release of jailed dissidents a promise not to 
sell mediumrange missiles to syria acceptance of peace corps 
volunteers fulbright scholars and a voice of america correspondent 
back into the country and the muting of antius propaganda 
but critics have countered that the missile promise was nothing 
more than a repeating of assurances given months before the 
crackdown that the effects of martial law remain in place and that 
arrests harassment and secret trials of prodemocracy agitators 
continue 
they also contend that bushs administrative actions to protect 
the students can be revoked at any time and could be subject to a 
court challenge 
three republican senators who attended a white house meeting 
with bush on other matters late in the day said afterward they 
stood with the president on the china question and predicted his 
veto would be sustained 
sen john chafee rri said we expect to see that veto 
sustained 
asked if bush already had the support of 34 gop senators sen 
john warner rva said were closing the gap on that question 
right now 
im going to support the president said sen david 
durenberger rminn 
all 25 house members who voted against the override were 
republicans bob stump arizona john paul hammerschmidt and tommy 
robinson arkansas porter goss andy ireland and cw bill young

privilege in china is rarely ostentatious and 
the store at no 32 donganmen street is no exception 
the facade is ordinary brown stone with a narrow entry for 
cars the window shades are down and further protected by heavy 
iron grills there is no sign 
inside however may be the only food store in china with more 
sales clerks than customers 
around the corner on wangfujing street thousands of shoppers 
jostled their way to counters on a recent afternoon to buy food for 
saturdays lunar new year but the store at no 32 was nearly 
deserted 
four clerks stood idle behind a glass counter displaying chinas 
bestbrand cigarettes liquor candy and canned food two more 
women sat in the cashiers booth and four other workers stood 
nearby 
two men lugging a large crate of eggs out to a truck were the 
only customers across the courtyard another room housed freezers 
of meat and fish also with no buyers 
our store is not for the residents said deputy manager qin 
jie not everyone can come in only those approved by the higher 
authorities 
the store run by the beijing city food supply center a 
wholesale food distributor is part of chinas littlepublicized 
decadesold network of special privileges for toplevel officials 
and their families 
qin would not say just who can shop at the store which opened 
in 1955 the exchange went like this 
a few leading comrades can come he said 
who he was asked 
a few the scope is set by the higher authorities he said 
can the president 
yes qin replied 
the premier 
yes he said 
a cabinet minister he was asked 
not necessarily qin said 
less than 10 people 
several dozen he said 
how many dozen 
a few qin answered 
a recent article in the hong kongbased china market magazine 
said the store originally supplied only the state chairman premier 
and president and their deputies and the chairmen and deputies of 
the legislature and chinese peoples political consultative 
conference a highlevel advisory body 
but after these officials retired or died their relatives 
continued using the store the magazine said and their successors 
expanded the customer list 
in august as part of a package of measures intended to blunt 
popular resentment of official privilege the government said it 
was ending special supplies of rationed foods to top officials qin 
said leaders had been allowed to buy extra cooking oil meat sugar 
and eggs at subsidized prices 
ordinary chinese were limited to rations or in recent years 
could buy extra only on the highpriced free market 
but the government did not shut down no 32 which still offers 
the rare privilege of convenient shopping 
we stock many things so you can buy all in one stop said 
qin he said the store offers a wider selection and generally 
higher quality of meat and fish than most markets at slightly 
higher prices 
but a comparison found some items were cheaper ham for 
example went for less than 85 cents a pound compared with 105 
at a regular store maotai chinas famous fiery liquor sold for 
18 compared with 1950 at the ordinary shop 
qin said there was no contradiction in a socialist society 
offering special stores for special people its convenient he 
said with some exasperation china is a developing country and 
its foodstuffs are not so ample 
he noted that ordinary citizens are supposed to buy their 
monthly rations of statesubsidized meat eggs and rice at assigned 
stores and said the concept was similar no store could supply 
all of society 
annual sales to leading officials were no more than 213000 
out of the beijing city food supply centers total sales of about 
17 million qin said 
the centers main customers are hotels and two small stores for 
visiting overseas chinese and foreigners who like officials 
often have special status in china these places buy wholesale from 
a large wellmarked building across the street from no 32 
neither building is a place to meet top officials 
as far as i know they dont come themselves usually its 
household servants who come weve never encountered the wife or 
relative of a communist party central committee member qin 
said 
when you come here its like walking into any department 
store added li peiji assistant managing director we dont 
ask a customers status 
thats for three employees who stand near the entrance to do 
qin said they ask customers to show a card indicating authorization 
to shop there 
but three men who walked in for cigarettes shortly before the 5 
pm closing time said no one asked them for id 
ive been here a few times said one wearing the uniform of 
a navy commander they have a wide variety of goods and the 
service isnt bad 
asked if they were related to any highranking officials the 
three just laughed 
qin was unperturbed by the apparent breach of exclusivity 
maybe when he came before he was with someone who had 
identification he said of the navy commander we welcome the 
expansion of our service

nonunion coal operators drove trucks 
through a human barricade wednesday after federal marshals ordered 
tow trucks to haul away vehicles blocking a coal companys private 
road

women who give up smoking lower their risk of 
heart attacks quickly just as men do a study today concludes 
women who smoke face nearly four times the usual risk of heart 
attacks before age 65 earlier research has shown that the high 
risk of heart attacks in male smokers goes away within a few years 
of stopping but the new study is the first to show that this also 
happens in women 
the present data underscore the value of smoking cessation for 
women as for men and may give women a convincing motive to quit 
even if they have smoked heavily for many years the researchers 
wrote in the new england journal of medicine 
the study found that the risk of suffering a first heart attack 
was 36 times higher among current smokers than among those who 
never had smoked however within three years of giving up smoking 
their risk had dropped to the point where it was no higher than 
that of the nonsmokers 
smoking has fallen from favor among both sexes although the 
decline has been steeper among men during the past two decades 
the proportion of men who smoke has fallen from 51 percent to 29 
percent while among women it has dropped from 33 percent to 24 
percent 
the latest analysis was conducted by dr lynn rosenberg and 
colleagues from the sloan epidemiology unit at boston university 
school of medicine 
the work was based on 910 women who were admitted for heart 
attacks at 71 hospitals in massachusetts rhode island connecticut 
and new york their smoking habits were compared to those of 2375 
women who were in the hospitals for other reasons

amnesty international today accused 
somalias government of arbitrarily imprisoning torturing and 
executing its citizens without a fair trial 
the londonbased human rights organization called on the 
government of president mohammed siad barre to establish a 
comprehensive program of legal and institutional reforms to end 
the abuses 
amnesty pointed to what it called political arrests and 
killings in july 1989 and further human rights violations later 
in the year 
it called them a serious setback to human rights improvements 
made in the first half of 1989 when the government of the horn 
of africa country released more than 1000 political prisoners 
with its 13page report amnesty became the second international 
human rights organization to sharply criticize the siad barre 
regime this year 
earlier this month new yorkbased africa watch said the somali 
military had killed between 40000 and 50000 unarmed civilians in 
the past 19 months 
africa watch said most of the victims were members of the isaac 
clan from which a northern insurgent group the somali national 
movement largely draws its strength 
amnesty noted that it had been allowed to send a delegation to 
somalia in june for the first time in 20 years but said it 
received few replies from the government since then 
shortly after its june visit amnesty said there were new 
arrests of suspected political opponents killings of demonstrators 
and extrajudicial executions the organization said most 
political prisoners are held under a vague security law and tried 
by a court lacking judicial independence 
amnesty said defendants can be sentenced to death for 
organizing a subversive association or strikes and exploiting 
religion for creating national disunity 
washington has withheld or canceled more than 50 million in aid 
dating back to 1987 because of human rights abuses britain france 
and other western donors also have slashed funds 
siad barre a major general said to be in his 80s seized power 
in october 1968 to prevent the election to the presidency of a 
civilian opposed by the army in recent years he has ruled a 
deteriorating nation beset by tribal rebellions in the north and 
south clan warfare and a bankrupt economy 
somalia became independent in 1960 after the unification of the 
north and south colonized by britain and italy respectively

the us theater is superficial says arthur 
miller whos in london for rehearsals of his play the price 
which opens next month 
contrasting unsubsidized theater in the united states with the 
stateaided british theater miller said american theater often has 
degenerated into a search for titillating ways to fill unsubsidized 
and expensive seats 
during a break at the young vic theater the 74yearold 
playwright told reporters that standards in british theater could 
fall if subsidies were reduced 
prime minister margaret thatchers conservative government 
favors financing the arts by private business sponsorship 
miller known for such works as death of a salesman and 
the crucible said unsubsidized american seat prices made an 
evening at the theater so expensive that general audiences would 
not go unless a critic said the production was a masterpiece even 
if the critic was wrong 
he said that meant audiences in the united states have become a 
selfserving clique and the plays appear tailored to match the 
audience

more than 19 million early retirees are 
willing and able to return to work according to a private survey 
released today that its sponsors say uncovers a promising untapped 
labor pool for american business 
the exciting news for employers is its a far more robust pool 
than we had imagined said thomas w moloney senior vice 
president of the commonwealth fund a philanthropic foundation that 
commissioned the poll 
the united states is expected to face a severe labor shortage 
by early in the next century he said this report should 
encourage business to look toward capable committed older 
americans to fill many of these openings 
moloney said the findings run counter to popular perceptions 
that there are few older americans who are available capable and 
willing to return to work in the kinds of jobs that are in demand 
the findings are based on a 1989 national survey by louis harris 
and associates inc of 1751 men aged 5564 and 1758 women aged 
5059 with 43 percent of those surveyed not working the different 
age groups for men and women were selected to catch them at the 
times when more people traditionally drop out of the work force 
the survey found the retirees main reason for wanting to return 
to work was to do something useful cited by 71 percent sixtyfour 
percent said working keeps them feeling younger 46 percent said 
they were bored without a job 45 percent said they needed extra 
spending money and 43 percent they needed money for essentials 
the survey data was analyzed by icf inc a washington 
consulting firm which concluded that of the 19 million older 
people who are willing and able to work 11 million are highly 
committed to and capable of rejoining the work force 
these people said they need a job for financial reasons are 
physically able to do key tasks such as driving or using a 
calculator are seeking work and have reasonable wage expectations 
are willing to work under difficult conditions such as standing up 
or on weekends they are also willing to take jobs that are in 
demand such as sales word processing clerical positions day care 
and managerial posts 
these retirees also had education job skills and experience 
largely comparable to those of their counterparts still in the work 
force the poll found 
seventyfive percent were high school or college graduates 
compared to 85 percent of those still working sixtyfour percent 
had five or more years of experience on their last job compared to 
77 percent of current older workers 
most also were willing to work under difficult conditions 83 
percent would take seasonal jobs 60 percent would work standing 
up 73 percent would work alone 60 percent would commute more than 
30 minutes and 54 percent would work evenings and weekends 
what we see here are capable educated experienced people who 
want to get back in moloney said these are people who 
certainly should not be at the age of retirement 
moloney said the study did not analyze why these people left the 
work force before age 65 but they may have been forced out of 
their jobs quit because of family demands or thought they had 
enough retirement income to stop working 
he said many of the retirees have been discouraged from 
rejoining the labor force by employers looking for younger workers 
but the climate is changing as labor markets tighten and employers 
attitudes toward older workers improve 
the commonwealth fund said employers need to be better educated 
about the abilities and availability of early retirees older 
persons should be encouraged to actively seek work and programs 
such as job banks should be established to help match jobs and 
workers the foundation said it was launching an older americans at 
work program designed to change impressions about the value and 
ability of older workers

a generation of us military officers reared 
on the threat of a soviet invasion of europe now agree the warsaw 
pact is dying in the wake of the revolution in eastern europe 
but some regard the demise of their old enemy as a mixed 
blessing 
these changes in eastern europe reduce the soviet unions 
confidence and capacity to wage coalition warfare said lt gen 
henry soyster head of the pentagons defense intelligence agency 
an organization that historically has emphasized soviet strengths 
rather than weaknesses 
soviet officials have not publicly acknowledged the de facto 
collapse of their alliance declaring instead their readiness to 
transform the warsaw pact from a military into a political 
organization 
us analysts say such a transformation has little chance of 
success 
for the united states and its 15 allies in the north atlantic 
treaty organization the collapse of their eastern counterpart 
creates some uneasiness 
at the height of the east european revolution last fall many 
us officials thought the warsaw pact should be preserved as a 
vehicle for negotiating conventional force reductions in europe and 
as a forum for resolving potential disagreements within the soviet 
bloc said one administration source 
most policymakers now have concluded that there is a danger in 
the artificial perpetuation of an institution that might collapse 
of its own weight said the source who spoke on condition of 
anonymity 
dissenters from that view want a warsaw pact because of the 
shaken confidence which would result from a sudden demise the 
source said 
soyster said the collapse of the warsaw pact virtually 
eliminated the threat of an eastwest confrontation in europe 
which for decades was deemed the most likely starting place for a 
superpower war 
i believe that the soviets would consider large scale theater 
operations against nato with only their own forces as highly risky 
if not impractical soyster testified on the first day of senate 
armed service committee hearings on the soviet threat 
at a conference of eastern and western military officers last 
week in vienna lt gen nikolai chervov of the soviet general 
staff said there will be major restructuring of the eastern 
blocs military command apparatus handing authority from soviet 
generals to east european elected leaders soyster told the senate 
committee 
the point chervov and others soviets have said is to transform 
the warsaw pact from a military into a political organization 
the warsaw pact is dead as a military organization because 
the eastern european nations are asking the soviets to withdraw 
their troops how can they expect to keep it as a political 
organization said james a blackwell a former army officer and 
analyst at the center for strategic and international studies in 
washington 
although none of the six nonsoviet nations in the pact have 
withdrawn three of them czechoslovakia hungary and poland 
have asked that soviet troops be withdrawn from their territory no 
soviet troops are in bulgaria and romania 
last week at the vienna conference hungarian military leader 
laszlo borsits said his nation would stay in the warsaw pact for 
the time being but would cut its troops by onethird 
czechoslovakia and poland also have announced force reductions 
despite the changes borsits said the warsaw pact and nato 
should remain as a stabilizing factor their loosening would 
upset the balance and would lead to incalculable consequences 
the unstated fear is of a unified germany 
former secretary of state henry a kissinger suggested in a 
recent television interview that moscow should maintain some 
position in eastern europe as a safety net if there should be a 
revival of german nationalism or expansionism the unification of 
east and west germany he said was inevitable

a swedish economist author of a widely 
acclaimed book on mikhail s gorbachevs attempts at reform says 
the soviet leaders chances of success are fading and that he may 
be pushed out of office 
the soviet union is not only lagging but plunging further 
into a crisis that can be called an economic catastrophe anders 
aslund told a small seminar wednesday attended by several top 
administration analysts 
the soviets face three likely scenarios radical reform deeper 
chaos or a counterrevolution by the military or conservative 
communist party leaders who will seek to reimpose an authoritarian 
system anders told a seminar at the center for strategic and 
international studies a washington think tank 
aslund who worked in the swedish embassy in moscow in 198487 
attracted wide attention among administration and academic analysts 
last year with his book gorbachevs struggle for economic 
reform 
consumers are experiencing acute shortages of food and other 
staples and industry faces an energy crisis wages are growing 
faster than prices although there are fewer goods for workers to 
purchase said aslund he noted that the soviet union experienced a 
5 percent drop in 1989 national income the statistic the 
soviets use to measure their overall economic performance 
he predicted a 10 percent drop in 1990 for national income 
two top administration analysts on the soviet union shared 
aslunds pessimism but questioned aspects of his dire predictions 
both analysts speaking on condition of anonymity shared 
aslunds view that deeper chaos was likely but said gorbachev had 
more support on the ruling politburo than described by aslund 
aslund said opposition is growing against the soviet leader in 
the upper echelons of the communist party in the government 
bureaucracies and among local party leaders 
the bureaucracies are ganging up he said 
gorbachev has only two reliable allies on the ruling politburo 
foreign minister eduard a shevardnadze and aleksandr yakovlev 
said aslund predicting the moderate majority might give the top 
job to premier nikolai ryzhkov 
one of the senior administration analysts said gorbachev has a 
working majority on the 11member body including ryzhkov and other 
moderate economic decisionmakers 
he has to have more support any other explanation simply 
doesnt explain what has happened said the analyst the 
politburo has been growing steadily more liberal under popular 
pressure 
but he said gorbachev might be forced from his job as 
communist party general secretary if fighting continues in and 
around the southern republic of azerbaijan or he fails to persuade 
the baltic republics of lithuania latvia and estonia to drop their 
plans to secede from the soviet union 
gorbachev nonetheless might complete his fiveyear term as 
president the analyst said adding that the congress of peoples 
deputies which elected gorbachev president last year does not 
have enough power to contest the military or the kgb secret police 
the prestige of the communist party will decrease following 
elections scheduled in february and march in the 15 soviet 
republics both administration analysts predicted 
aslund said gorbachev missed an opportunity for radical economic 
reform by failing to push through a plan advanced last fall by 
leonid abalkin a deputy premier abalkin advocated rapid 
introduction of market economy along lines followed by the 
solidarityled government in neighboring poland 
instead what we are seeing is a complete retraction from 
reform as the central government attempts to reassert economic 
authority aslund said 
president bush and secretary of state james a baker iii are 
taking the correct policy toward gorbachev praising his efforts 
and granting him a number of economic favors at the malta summit 
last december said aslund 
bush and baker are approaching this in the right way saying 
they want perestroika to succeed aslund said using the russian 
word for the reforms i think it extremely unlikely that it 
will 
the payoff from gorbachevs reforms could come a decade hence 
he said 
i look on what is happening as a learning experience he 
said the ideas pursued by gorbachev and his radical allies will 
have a better chance of success when soviet citizens are more 
mature he said i am fairly optimistic about the longterm

the navy secretary is defending the services 
new 12 billion guidedmissile destroyer against congressional 
charges of contracting problems and the absence of a basic test of 
the ships sophisticated computer system 
these ships will be the most advanced most powerful 
destroyers ever sent to sea h lawrence garrett iii told members 
of a house armed services panel wednesday that is looking into 
allegations surrounding the arleigh burkeclass ship 
the navy currently plans to purchase 33 of the ships at a cost 
of 27 billion 
martin m ferber director of the general accounting offices 
national security and international affairs division said the lead 
ship under construction by the bath iron works in maine is 17 
months behind schedule and design changes have resulted in the 
billiondollar plus pricetag 
bath iron works is now accelerating construction to meet the 
planned delivery in february 1991 ferber told the subcommittee 
on seapower and strategic and critical materials 
but garrett argued the program is on track to provide our 
fleet the most capable destroyer ever built within the contractor 
cost the navy estimated more than six years ago and on a delivery 
schedule which has remained constant for more than two 
members of the panel largely agreed with the navy secretary that 
the program is important focusing their criticism on the gao the 
investigative arm of congress and a fellow colleague who initially 
complained about the destroyer 
rep john dingell dmich the chairman of the house energy and 
commerce subcommittee on oversight and investigations wrote a 
letter to the navy last september citing cost overruns and schedule 
delays in the destroyer program 
dingell was unable to testify before the armed services panel 
because of a scheduling conflict but in a fourpage letter to the 
subcommittee said his early assessment of the program as a 
procurement nightmare may have been an understatement 
dingell complained the sophisticated aegis computer system that 
will be installed on the destroyer has never been tested against 
some missiles 
a specific type of missile known as an antiradiation missile 
that is specifically targeted to home in on the aegis powerful 
radar emissions has never been tested against the system 
dingell said 
rep charles e bennett dfla chairman of the armed services 
panel raised that issue with garrett questioning why the aegis 
hasnt been tested against the antiradiation missile 
the arm is like any other cruise missile to the aegis 
garrett said 
but when pressed by bennett the navy secretary conceded there 
were some dangers involved

the bush administration is assuring congress 
of strong support for a popular nutrition program for poor pregnant 
women and children after a new report showed reagan appointees 
erroneously downplayed its benefits 
birge watkins deputy assistant agriculture secretary for food 
and consumer services said wednesday the reagan administration was 
wrong to change a study on the effectiveness of the women infants 
and children nutrition program 
we are all aware of president bushs strong support of the wic 
program and of its significant investment in the next generation 
watkins told a joint hearing of the house select committee on 
hunger and the senate agriculture committee 
he said the bush administration agreed with a general accounting 
office investigation which showed the agriculture department under 
president reagan inserted errors and deleted important conclusions 
in a study of wic that was released in 1986 
its simply no way to do business we regret this whole 
incident happened said watkins 
members of congress were outraged 
the original report did not track with the administration 
ideological bent so the findings were cooked to make them more 
palatable charged sen tom harkin diowa what a despicable 
and insensitive action 
john bode assistant secretary for food and consumer services 
under reagan strongly disagreed with that characterization 
bode who was responsible for the administrations handling of 
the study was not invited to testify he said in a telephone 
interview after the hearing that the changes were not made for 
political reasons 
to assert there was willful misrepresentation to congress is 
wrong he said 
the revisions were written by thomas sullivan then a special 
assistant to bode 
now practicing law bode said he believes the compendium was 
wrong but thought at the time that sullivan and others at the 
department who reviewed the study knew what they were doing 
he said that shortly after the review he changed procedures for 
handling such matters so the same mistakes would not happen 
bode said the main problem was that sullivan wrote a compendium 
for the reagan administration report on wic in which he downplayed 
the strength of the program bode said wic should have gotten a 
much stronger endorsement 
sullivan who also has left government service could not 
immediately be reached for comment 
keith fultz of the gao said investigators could not pin down 
the intent behind the changes 
he said the summary written by the original researchers was 
deleted and replaced by a compendium that did not fairly 
represent what the study team found 
that the study took almost seven years to complete also angered 
members of the two committees 
the final report took six years instead of the originally 
targeted 2 years to complete and cost 6 million instead of the 
planned 39 million said rep tony hall dohio chairman of 
the hunger committee 
the wic program was started in 1972 congress appropriated 725 
million for wic in 1980 and increased the amount by at least 100 
million each year 
that was not always enough to keep up with inflation and has 
never been enough to reach all the eligible women and children but 
was consistently higher than the reagan budget requests said a 
member of the senate agriculture committee staff 
for instance reagan proposed cutting the program in 1982 from 
the 869 million of the previous year to 637 million congress 
refused to go along and appropriated 948 million 
the 1990 appropriation is 213 billion serving about 46 
million women and children said watkins he said that about 
twothirds of eligible recipients are getting help through the 
program

having a big potbelly is bad for cholesterol and 
this could explain why when it comes to body shapes pears are 
better than apples according to a study published today 
when patients come in we advise them to lose weight said 
dr richard e ostlund jr this paper suggests that more 
important than that is how the fat is distributed 
researchers have long noticed that folks with big spare tires 
tend to have an especially high risk of heart trouble but the 
reason was unclear ostlunds study in new england journal of 
medicine suggests that people with beefy hips and trim waists have 
higher levels of a protective form of cholesterol called hdl than 
do those with potbellies and small behinds 
the study of healthy elderly people conducted at washington 
university school of medicine found that body shape alone could 
account for a large portion of the differences in peoples hdl 
cholesterol levels 
this may have tremendous importance to the average american 
because we all tend to bulge out in this way said dr william 
castelli director of the longrunning framingham heart study in 
suburban boston 
hdl high density lipoprotein is the socalled good 
cholesterol the more people have in their blood the lower their 
chances of heart attacks women typically have higher hdl levels 
than men as they grow older women also tend to put on weight 
around the hips while men are more prone to growing big tummies 
doctors have long suspected that differences in sex hormones 
might explain the hdl disparity between men and women however the 
new study suggests that body shape not sex could be the key 
factor it found that pearshaped men tend to have high hdl while 
appleshaped women have lower hdl 
its not how fat you are its where the fats located said 
ostlund the fat around your hips the good fat that women have 
is predominantly subcutaneous fat but the fat you have in your 
belly is intraabdominal fat the difference is where the blood 
supply of those two areas drains 
tummy fat surrounds the intestines and its blood supply drains 
directly to the liver he said the liver is sensitive to things 
that fat cells put out the metabolism of the liver may be changed 
because of the intraabdominal fat including the livers 
production of hdl 
the blood from hip fat which is just underneath the skin does 
not drain directly to the liver and so has less impact on the way 
it works he said 
the study was conducted on 77 men and 69 women all in their 
70s to measure whether they were apples or pears the researchers 
calculated the ratio of their waisttohip circumference 
they found that 32 percent of the variation in their hdl levels 
could be explained by differences in this ratio 
the bottom line for the middleaged and elderly is dont let 
that spare tire get you around the waist said castelli get 
out and exercise and diet 
however ostlund said dieting is a hard way to tackle the 
problem since fat patterns may be established at birth 
its very hard to change your waisttohip ratio ostlund 
said you can do it if you lose a massive amount of weight but 
losing 10 to 20 pounds doesnt change it very much

a panel of experts says the government must 
do more to turn down the volume in the workplace and on consumer 
products to save the hearing of millions of americans 
the panel convened by the national institutes of health on 
wednesday concluded that better protection for workers noise 
labeling of consumer products limits on noise levels for some 
products and an educational campaign would cut the number of people 
with hearing problems 
of the 28 million americans who suffer hearing loss about 10 
million of the impairments were caused at least partly by exposure 
to loud noises the panel said 
dr patrick e brookhouser panel chairman and director of the 
boys town national research hospital in omaha neb said although 
the united states is the world leader in hearingloss research 
the fact that were not continuing to implement our own 
recommendations is a concern to the panel 
we know how to solve the problem we just dont want to put in 
the effort and expense for it he said 
unnecessary hearing loss is occurring now because were not 
implementing what we already know are good preventive strategies 
exposure to loud sounds in the workplace is the most common 
cause of noiserelated hearing loss and poses a danger to 
firefighters police officers military personnel construction and 
factory workers musicians farmers and truck drivers among 
others the panel said 
outside the workplace hazards include loud music recreational 
vehicles airplanes lawncare equipment woodworking tools some 
household appliances and chain saws the panel said 
short bursts of loud noise as in an explosion or gunfire can 
damage hearing permanently while longer exposure to less intense 
but still loud noise exacts a gradual toll on hearing 
sensitivity initially without the victims awareness the panel 
said in a statement 
hearing loss is irreversible when the sensitive innerear 
structure is damaged said brookhouser 
one of the problems is that people are losing hearing and they 
dont know it because its not painful he said 
exposure to sounds up to 75 decibels which is the noise of a 
dishwasher or vacuum cleaner are generally safe even over long 
periods of exposure he said 
however sounds at levels more than 85 decibels which is the 
noise level of a lawnmower or food blender for eight hours a day 
over a long period of time can damage hearing permanently he said 
the greater the noise the shorter the period of exposure necessary 
to cause permanent damage 
two warning signs of dangerous noise exposure are ringing in the 
ears and a muffling of sounds that are heard 
a rock concert delivers about 130 decibels of sound which can 
cause a temporary hearing loss that can take several days or a week 
to recover from brookhouser said 
he noted some in the concert industry have begun voluntarily to 
lower the volume because they are becoming more aware of the 
dangers to hearing 
panel members called for more such efforts in the entertainment 
field and for manufacturers to design quieter products and 
regulations to limit the maximum noise of certain products such as 
portable cassette players 
the panel also called for reestablishment of the environmental 
protection agencys office of noise abatement and control which 
was closed during the reagan administration in 1982 
julia doswell royster president of environmental noise 
consultants inc in cary nc said existing epa noise rules are 
largely unenforced the occupational health and safety 
administration also has regulations covering workers but she said 
they should be stronger and better enforced 
epa spokesman dave ryan said the agency has taken no enforcement 
actions since the office closed but is conducting five compliance 
investigations of makers of hearing protectors

japans opposition parties remain divided by 
distrust and policy disagreements as campaigning starts for next 
months election 
despite a longawaited opportunity presented by the scandals and 
the slumping popularity of the liberal democratic government 
opposition politicians concede they are far from setting up a 
coalition 
at this point we have to admit it is difficult for us to come 
to any sort of agreement on coalition terms before the general 
election said tsuruo yamaguchi secretarygeneral of the japan 
socialist party the largest opposition group 
each party is busy worrying about its own business ahead of 
the feb 18 election yamaguchi said in an interview 
socialist chairwoman takako doi and the heads of three centrist 
parties met wednesday after the lower house of parliament was 
dissolved for the crucial election they declared they were united 
on three points to oust the liberal democrats scrap an unpopular 
3 percent sales tax and continue coalition talks 
it was the first time since december the four key opposition 
parties had held a joint meeting 
they started talking about coalition terms in april but have 
been unable to overcome such obstacles as the socialists 
opposition to japans armed forces and to the treaty under which 
the united states bases about 50000 troops in japan and is obliged 
to help defend japan if it is attacked 
the three other parties hold more conservative views 
akira yamagishi chairman of the japanese trade union federation 
and a key mediator in the opposition talks said it was quite 
regrettable that the parties are divided when they have the best 
chance in decades to oust the liberal democrats 
to me their policy disagreements sound like no more than 
their excuses for not being able to cooperate yamagishi said 
the liberal democrats have headed japans governments since 1955 
and the only time the socialists have been at the top since world 
war ii was a few months in 1947 and 1948 when they led a coalition 
the opposition has been out of power for so long that they 
have lost realistic aspirations to govern the country yamagishi 
said 
for the socialists to claim the premiership for ms doi the 
liberal democrats would have to lose at least 39 of their 295 seats 
in the outgoing house and the socialists would have to join other 
parties and assemble at least 257 seats a bare majority in the 
512seat house 
while polls show the liberal democrats could lose their 
majority they seem assured of remaining the largest party and 
there is speculation that they not the socialists will entice 
the centrists into a coalition 
prospects for a socialistled coalition of the centerleft are 
clouded by the communist party which holds 27 seats in the 
outgoing house the marxistleninist party is entirely excluded 
from the coalition blueprint because of its revolutionary stances 
but it could emerge with a key block of swing seats 
the socialists holding 83 seats are more moderate than the 
communists but there are radical factions within the socialist 
party which adhere to its traditional stance of making japan 
neutral and unarmed and calling for socialist revolutions 
leaders of centrist parties the democratic socialist party 25 
lower house seats the komeito or clean government party 54 
seats and the united social democratic party four seats say 
the socialists must modify radical policy stances to be a coalition 
partner 
we are talking about forming a government of the second 
economic superpower of the world wed better be sure who we are 
dealing with takashi yonezawa secretarygeneral of the 
democratic socialist party which parted from the socialists in the 
1960s over policy disagreements said in an interview 
the clean government party secretarygeneral yuuichi ichikawa 
said how can we take over the government when the leader of the 
opposition camp is not ready to do so we just have to wait for the 
socialists to become more realistic 
socialist leader doi has softened the partys positions saying 
it will acknowledge japans armed forces and the security alliance 
with the united states 
we have said our party recognizes that japan is a member of 
western allies she said in an interview last week seeking 
drastic change is not what we want 
but komeito leader koshiro ishida and democratic socialist 
leader eiichi nagasue demanded the socialists put their policy 
modifications into their platform 
yamaguchi argued it was the centrist parties turn to concede 
i think it is important for each party to have its own unique 
goals the socialist secretarygeneral said as far as policy 
modifications are concerned we did all we can do

the us food and drug administration took a 
lastminute stand against a plan to label foods deemed safe by the 
american heart association but the organization says it will go 
ahead anyway 
the program known as heartguide is scheduled to begin monday 
its an ambitious effort by the association to make consumers 
smarter shoppers by identifying products low in saturated fat 
total fat cholesterol and sodium 
the program has been in the works for three years but acting 
fda commissioner james s benson told the association wednesday it 
risked regulatory action if it proceeded with the plan 
fda believes that your program will increase consumer 
confusion and hamper any comprehensive solution to the food 
labeling program benson wrote to the group 
the association decided to proceed 
weve already talked to the companies participating in the 
program and they are in said a heartguide spokeswoman jamy 
poth 
products tested and approved by the association would for a 
fee carry a symbol made up of a red heart and a check mark 
discussions have been held with the fda throughout the past 
year said vicki anderson another spokeswoman for heartguide and 
the heart association was distressed with the lastminute letter 
but an fda spokesman said the agency has expressed concerns to 
the association during the past year 
i would think they would have been aware of them said the 
spokesman jeff nesbit 
in the wake of the letter the second phase of the program in 
which cereals cheese cookies pasta salad dressings and other 
foods will be included has been put on hold to allow time for 
further negotiations with the fda anderson said 
the fda has no authority to act before products are sold nesbit 
said once they are on supermarket shelves however the agency 
determines whether labels are misleading 
if it determined that the associations seal of approval was 
misleading it could order that the symbol be removed or it could 
seek a court order to block the sale of products with the symbol 
or seize them nesbit said 
the program has been criticized on the grounds that competitive 
pressures would force companies to participate and that it 
promotes certain foods instead of promoting the idea of a healthy 
overall diet 
the association said its educational program will make clear 
that heartguideapproved foods should be incorporated into a diet 
that is beneficial overall 
the fees paid to the association up to 640000 depending 
upon a products sales also have been criticized 
what we see here is a realization by the government agencies 
that you have a nonprofit private organization a nonregulated 
organization trying to establish a set of rules and regulations on 
labeling for a fee i think thats wrong said john cady 
president of the national food processors association which has 
vigorously opposed the program 
more than 100 brands of margarine oil crackers and vegetables 
already have been tested and approved they include mazola corn 
oil promise margarine pam cooking sprays melba toast and 
hanover frozen vegetables 
none of the labeled products is currently available on the 
shelves anderson said manufacturers had begun printing containers 
with the labels but that products were not yet ready for shipment 
to supermarkets 
the makers of mazola products had not yet decided how to react 
to the fdas action said gail griffin spokeswoman for cpc 
international of englewood cliffs nj that is the parent company 
of best foods which makes mazola 
the fdas letter was addressed to heart association president 
dr myron l weisfeldt of johns hopkins university in baltimore 
benson urged the heart association instead to join with the 
fda and other groups in our current initiative to develop a 
comprehensive revision of the food label to promote good 
nutrition

when a graham down taught american history in 
college he would ask his students such questions as how new was 
the new deal or should president truman have dropped the 
bomb 
down says such broad questions aimed at showing the depth of 
students understanding of subjects should replace the 
standardized multiplechoice questions that are now used to assess 
what students know 
there is no right answer and that understanding of ambiguity 
is surely the most important source of inspiration that informs 
citizenry of a real democracy down said wednesday in leading a 
call for reform of the widelyused standardized tests 
down head of the council for basic education joined leaders of 
more than three dozen national education parent and civil rights 
organizations to urge president bush and the nations governors to 
move toward assessments based on actual student performance 
the groups statement on genuine accountability comes as the 
administration and governors move towards setting up national 
educational goals promised during an education summit last year 
one of the key issues is how to judge student performance 
the testing craze has damaged the quality of our schools 
said monte neill associate director of fairtest of cambridge 
mass which is spearheading the effort for reform 
lowincome and minoritygroup children have been particularly 
harmed teaching the narrow content included in multiplechoice 
tests has prevented students from learning higher order thinking 
skills he said 
the statement was signed by the leaders of 49 organizations 
including the american federation of teachers the asian law 
alliance council for basic education the institute for learning 
and teaching national indian youth council inc national parent 
teacher association federation of organizations for professional 
women national association for the education of young children 
naacp and the national association of elementary school principals 
absent from the list were the national education association and 
the national association of secondary school principals 
gregory anrig president of the educational testing service the 
princeton nj group that produces several standardized exams for 
collegebound students said he disagrees with the blanket 
rejection of multiplechoice tests 
they remain a valid efficient and inexpensive means to 
measure certain important aspects of student achievement he said 
in a statement 
to simply call for abandonment of a proven and economical 
method of measurement is to go forth with one of educations hands 
tied behind its back and impede the timely progress that all 
americans desire for our schools he said 
but naacp education director beverly cole said america needs 
measures of educational performance which provide a level playing 
field for all students standardized exams with their 
welldocumented biases and flaws fail this basic test 
barbara willer of the national association for the education of 
young children said better alternatives to standardized tests 
include teacher observation portfolios of student work and 
performances and exhibitions that are based on the curriculum 
too many young children today are retained a grade assigned 
to special classes or held out of school based on the results of 
readiness and achievement tests that have questionable predictive 
accuracy

mayors attending the meeting of the us 
conference of mayors say the absence of their host shows how far 
the ravages of drug abuse have reached 
it epitomizes it symbolizes the extent of the drug problem 
in this country boston mayor raymond flynn said when asked by 
reporters about washington mayor marion barry 
barry was in a florida treatment center where he had himself 
admitted following his arrest last week on a charge of possessing 
crack cocaine 
despite the national attention thats been riveted on barrys 
case in the past week no mayor mentioned their absent host 
publicly in the 1hour strategy session wednesday of the mayors 
drug task force 
nonetheless barrys case dominated the talk outside the meeting 
room as the nations bigcity mayors opened their threeday annual 
winter meeting 
it was a tragedy for the mayor and it was a tragedy for the 
district of columbia said philadelphia mayor wilson goode i 
dont see how it has any impact on what we do here 
houston mayor kathryn whitmire president of the conference of 
mayors avoided mention of barrys arrest in a speech across town 
to the national press club 
but when asked about it she said barrys arrest underscored the 
need for the federal government to spend more on drug treatment to 
make it available for those who need it so long as there is a 
demand for drugs she said no law enforcement effort will stop 
dealers from meeting that demand 
as we see him moving to get treatment for himself we are 
caused to realize once again how important it is that treatment be 
available not only to those in high places but to everyone who 
needs it whitmire said 
she and other mayors shied away from saying whether they 
believed barry should resign from office because of the cocaine 
arrest 
im not going to try to give any political advice to any other 
mayors she said 
flynn declined to say whether barry should resign but said id 
like to see an acknowledgement of marion barrys problem by the 
mayor he said if barry is cured of a substance dependence problem 
he should spend the rest of his life as an example to young 
people about the problems of drugs 
barrys appointed drug czar for the city sterling tucker sat 
in barrys chair at the drug task force meeting 
even before i came to the job i was aware there were these 
allegations here about drug use by barry tucker said when 
questioned by a reporter 
weve been faced with this all along theres been no 
major interruption for me we havent missed a beat 
barry is also chairman of the mayors transportation committee 
conference spokesman mike brown said another mayor would fill in 
for barry when that panel meets 
the mayors are awaiting president bushs latest plans for 
federal antidrug efforts and an appearance by senate judiciary 
committee chairman joseph biden ddel 
bush plans to address the mayors most of whom are democrats 
on friday it will be the first time since jimmy carter in 1980 
that a sitting president has spoken to the organization of bigcity 
mayors 
several black mayors interviewed said they did not see barrys 
case as a particular embarrassment for black officeholders or one 
that makes their antidrug efforts more difficult 
it only proves mayors are human said mayor john daniels of 
new haven conn 
mayor sharpe james of newark nj said he did not embrace the 
suggestion of naacp executive director benjamin hooks that the 
arrest was part of a pattern of harassment of black elected 
officials and a rising tide of racism but he noted the fbi has 
faced charges of minority harassment and said racism would be a 
factor in law enforcement until we rule out racism in our 
country 
mayor cardell cooper of east orange nj said i do believe 
black leadership has come under certainly scrutiny i dont 
know if youd call it undue or not he said barry might have 
put himself in position to invite attention and scrutiny

sen bob doles proposal to boost aid to 
eastern europe and panama by cutting funds from major recipients 
like israel and egypt is shortsighted and detrimental to us 
interests 22 republican house members say 
the house members wrote to president bush on wednesday to 
express our strong opposition to the dole foreign aid plan 
which would slice money from israel egypt turkey the philippines 
and pakistan 
we believe this is the wrong approach to the burgeoning needs 
of eastern europe said the house members led by reps vin weber 
of minnesota and bill mccollum of florida 
to reward one ally at the expense of another would be 
shortsighted and detrimental to american interests they said 
at the same time sen nancy kassebaum doles republican 
colleague from kansas said she supported dole and hoped his plan 
would lead to serious review and substantive reform of foreign 
aid 
senate majority leader george mitchell dmaine has not taken a 
stand on the issue but he is holding meetings with democratic 
colleagues to discuss foreign aid his aides said 
kassebaum who has introduced legislation to change the way 
foreign aid is divided up criticized congress for earmarking 
locking up 80 percent of the foreign aid budget 
as a result us officials have no flexibility to deal with 
unforeseen circumstances she said in a speech on the senate floor 
with earmarking we have set up a system that prevents us from 
responding to opportunities like those in eastern europe she 
said 
dole suggested changing the 1990 foreign aid budget that 
earmarks about 3 billion to israel slightly less to egypt about 
500 million each to turkey and pakistan and some 160 million in 
economic aid to the philippines 
his plan would trim 5 percent from the big recipients creating 
about 400 million that could go to eastern europe and panama 
many have criticized doles plan 
its not going anywhere period said sen tom harkin 
diowa a member of the senate appropriations committee 
debate on the 1991 foreign aid bill is expected to start soon 
once the bush administration unveils its requests next week 
sen patrick leahy dvt chairman of the senate appropriations 
subcommittee on foreign operations has said his panel will hold 
hearings reexamining us foreign aid priorities in light of the 
vast changes in the international situation 
as far as im concerned every program in the fiscal 1991 
foreign aid appropriation will be reviewed leahy said in a 
statement 
on jan 18 israeli defense minister yitzhak rabin met with bush 
administration officials and later said he had reasons to 
believe us aid to his country would hold steady at 3 billion a 
year through 1991 but he expressed concern about aid beyond next 
year

a scholarship program backed by rep mervyn m 
dymally received a 34200 donation from a new york diamond 
importer two months after dymally softened his opposition to us 
imports of south african diamonds the washington post reported 
today 
the paper said the california democrat later agreed to lobby his 
colleagues to support other changes that maurice tempelsman 
chairman of the board of lazare kaplan international inc wanted 
in a sanctions bill which eventually failed to pass the senate 
lki which last year had gross sales of 80 million buys 
diamonds from south africa and other countries many of them 
through the london debeers syndicate which does not distinguish 
the countries of origin of its diamonds 
dymally who the newspaper said declined to be interviewed told 
the newspaper in a onepage statement that he did not solicit 
contributions from mr tempelsman 
tempelsman was quoted as saying at no time did dymally hint 
that a contribution from me to the foundation would affect his 
position on the diamond sanctions 
i do not make charitable contributions merely because a 
congressman so suggests and would not under any circumstances 
consider making one in the hope of influencing his vote 
tempelsman said in a written response to questions no vote no 
bill no threat to my business could ever induce me to do that 
the 34200 was donated to the ana g mendez foundation and used 
to finance the 1988 mervyn m dymally young minority scholars 
program that sent 14 students from dymallys district to puerto 
rico for four weeks of study according to foundation president 
jose mendez 
that amount was suggested to tempelsman in a prospectus sent to 
him by amelia parker a dymally aide the newspaper said 
a foundation document according to the newspaper noted that 
part of the 34200 was set aside to pay honoraria dymally 
reported a 2000 honorarium from the mendez foundation in july 
1988 
the post said that other than the honoraria there is no 
indication that dymally personally benefited from the tempelsman 
donation 
tempelsman made a second donation of 25000 in 1989 
according to house rules members may not accept from a person 
with a direct interest in legislation favors or benefits 
under circumstances which might be construed by reasonable persons 
as influencing the performance of governmental duties 
in february 1987 dymally introduced legislation to ban us 
imports of south african diamonds 
accepting arguments that his initial bill was unworkable unfair 
to zimbabwe and without committee support he proposed changes in 
april 1988 to pending sanction legislation to weaken its impact on 
us diamond importers 
the post reported that dymallys change of heart came after a 
meeting with tempelsman howard marlowe a lobbyist for tempelsman 
said he drafted an amendment for dymally incorporating the changes 
that the foreign affairs committee accepted the house later went 
along but the senate refused 
tempelsman is a prominent new yorker who is a frequent escort of

us and vietnamese delegates to a conference on 
boat people refused to accept a compromise starting date for the 
forced repatriation of vietnamese denied refugee status and the 
30nation talks broke up in disarray 
at stake is the future of tens of thousands of vietnamese boat 
people waiting in camps in hong kong 
the united states had opposed the mandatory repatriation of 
vietnamese deemed to be economic migrants rather than refugees 
fleeing persecution but last week softened its stance and 
advocated slow movement on the issue 
britain wanted deportations to begin at once before the 
sailing season starts in march to deter a further influx of boat 
people into the overflowing camps of hong kong a british crown 
colony 
the office of the un high commissioner for refugees unhcr 
had tried to bridge the gap by suggesting a sixmonth delay in the 
repatriation process but us delegates told the closed 
unsponsored meeting the proposed july 1 date was too early and 
said no one should have to return to vietnam before jan 1 1991 
officials said 
after the talks ended wednesday chief british delegate robin 
mclaren expressed disappointment at the failure to reach an 
agreement that would have enabled unhcr to monitor people sent back 
to vietnam 
he said britain now will have to consider whether to go ahead 
and return more boat people against their will under a deal with 
hanoi britain forcibly sent back 51 boat people from the 
overcrowded hong kong camps last month 
mclaren speaking to journalists after the meeting said 
vietnamese officials told delegates any internationallyagreed 
program of forced repatriations should not begin before oct 1 
vietnam says it needs time to prepare for any mass return of 
boat people so they can be absorbed into vietnams stricken economy 
mclaren noted however that for the first time there was 
consensus that boat people deemed to have fled for economic reasons 
rather than political persecution should be returned even against 
their will 
sergio vieira de mello a senior unhcr official who presided 
over the twoday meeting in geneva said norways thorwald 
stoltenberg the new high commissioner for refugees was asked to 
see if a consensus could be reached he will negotiate directly 
with relevant capitals 
vieira de mello said there were no immediate plans for another 
international conference us and vietnamese delegates declined 
comment after the meeting 
earlier hong kong security chief geoffrey barnes warned that if 
no agreement emerged pressure would grow in hong kong to push 
boats of asylum seekers back out to sea 
he said hong kong could not cope with another influx of 35000 
boat people the number that flooded into the colony in 1989 
about 109000 boat people are in camps in southeast asia 
including 56000 in hong kong according to unhcr figures the 
44000 boat people who arrived in hong kong after june 1988 may be 
screened to determine if they class as genuine political refugees 
arrivals before june 1988 were granted refugee status without 
screening 
unhcr spokesman raymond hall said about 7000 people have so far 
been screened in hong kong and only 15 percent were accepted as 
genuine refugees 
he said 1100 people have returned voluntarily since march and a 
further 1400 are registered to go back all voluntary returnees 
receive 50 from the refugee agency and qualify for a years food 
aid from hanoi

lupo a migrant worker in la belle where most of the victims 
lived i cannot think of a worse way to die

into the 12footdeep canal surrounded by sugar cane fields about 
100 miles north of miami 
escobedo apparently escaped out the drivers side door but his 
wife manuela died in the passenger seat his 50yearold uncle 
nicolas escobedo managed to squeeze out the rear doors police 
said neither man was seriously injured 
the van was submerged about 15 minutes before rescuers received 
word wednesday morning police said 
some of them had stuck their arms out trying to get out but 
they just didnt make it said sheriffs lt bill chamness 
when the deputies dove in to get them they were already dead 
the bodies of the nine men and one woman ranging from age 16 to 
37 were taken to fort myers for autopsies police withheld their 
names early today pending notification of relatives in mexico 
police initially speculated the accident occurred because of the 
fog but the driver told investigators he lost control because the 
steering failed said florida highway patrol maj mike kirby in 
tallahassee 
it happened very fast we were on the road and then the next 
i knew we were under water said the drivers uncle 
the van was pulled out of the 50footwide canal and has been 
impounded for the investigation

moslem militants fighting for kashmirs 
secession from india opened fire today on air force officers 
killing at least four police said 
the killings raised to at least 61 the number of people killed 
in kashmir since saturday when the lingering moslem movement for 
secession from hindumajority india flared 
most of the killings have occured in confrontations between 
troops enforcing an aroundtheclock curfew and mobs of militants 
defying the curfew 
the attack makes it clear that the terrorists want to make 
targets of anyone who is associated with the indian government 
said a police official speaking on condition of anonymity 
the air force officers were waiting for a bus to take them to 
the srinagar airport when they were attacked by assailants who 
drove up in a car the police official said 
three of the officers were killed on the spot in repeated bursts 
of fire from automatic rifles and at least four others were 
wounded two of them seriously he said one of the wounded died at 
a hospital 
a woman and a child walking by were also hurt the official 
said witnesses said they saw at least five bodies being carried 
away after the shooting 
hundreds of troops and paramilitary police have been deployed to 
halt the violence in srinagar famous for its lakes and tourist 
resorts 
troops and the militants exchanged gunfire at four places in the 
city during a fourhour curfew relaxation which began at 5 am 
today police said no deaths were reported although one 
paramilitary policeman was wounded police said 
under the curfew imposed saturday people have been ordered to 
stay indoors except for brief periods when the ban is lifted to 
enable people to shop 
islamic militants are demanding either independence for 
predominantly moslem kashmir or union with neighboring islamic 
pakistan kashmir forms the northern part of jammukashmir state 
and srinagar is the summer capital 
the jammu region which lies south of kashmir is predominantly 
hindu 
claimed by india and pakistan kashmir was divided into indian 
and pakistani sectors by a ceasefire line that is monitored by 
un military observers 
the dispute over the territory which has led to two wars began 
after india and pakistan were partitioned on gaining independence 
from britain in 1947 
india has often accused pakistan of aiding kashmiri militants 
and pakistan has routinely denied the charge 
about 64 percent of jammukashmirs 5 million people are 
moslems nationwide moslems comprise 12 percent of indias 880 
million people and hindus make up 82 percent

czechoslovakias communist rulers committed 
three major errors contributing to their overthrow last month says 
the spokesman of the new citizens movement 
the first bad mistake by the communists came soon after they 
took power after the 1968 soviet invasion and ordered the 
countrys best people to do nothing by purging reform communists 
and other educated people from their normal jobs said civic forum 
leader martin palous 
another mistake was when the communist rulers failed to 
completely destroy charter 77 an organization of dissidents 
formed in 1977 he added during a wednesday gathering at the 
capitol 
hundreds of thousands of victims of the 196970 purge had to 
support themselves as night watchmen furnace stokers and other 
manual labor giving them time to study and read and prepare a 
good organization for humane society according to palous who 
said he stoked furnaces for five years after being sacked from his 
academic post 
people of diverse thinking such as excommunists catholics 
evangelists and socialists got to know each other for the first 
time in charter 77 even becoming friends and turning into an 
underground network he added 
after those two mistakes on the side of leniency the hardline 
government committed an error on the side of harshness that 
outraged the nation and overnight provided massive new backing for 
the underground palous continued this was the crackdown in prague 
last nov 17 in which police beat peaceful student demonstrators 
it unified their parents even those not involved in dissident 
activities and got all sorts of people involved in a great 
national movement that proved to be so strong as to change the 
government in a few days said palous 
palous and ivan havel brother and adviser to dissident 
playwright vaclav havel the new noncommunist president elected 
last month us prague ambassador shirley temple black the former 
child movie star and east european specialists experts attended 
the capitol meeting sponsored by the center for national policy a 
private nonpartisan research group 
palous and havel are an advance team for a government delegation 
expected here in late february after us secretary of state james 
a baker iiis planned talks in prague

the alleged leader of colombias 
secondlargest cocaine cartel has offered to turn himself in just 
as the government weighs how to respond to a similar peace offer 
fromthe boss of the no 1 cartel 
the latest offer from the traffickers in colombias 
fivemonthold drug war came from gilberto rodriguez orejuela the 
reputed chief of the cali cartel 
it came as colombias supreme court upheld a presidential decree 
allowing the government to seize the wealth of suspected 
traffickers 
in a letter to the owners of the bogota daily el tiempo 
published as a frontpage story wednesday rodriguez said he would 
be prepared to face an extradition request from the united states 
but that the merits of the us request would have to be judged 
under colombian law 
that presumably means rodriguez does not accept the validity of 
a decree by president virgilio barco allowing extraditions and is 
hoping the extradition request would be acted upon by a colombian 
judge 
in the last five months the 13 colombians extradited to the 
united states were sent without judicial review something feared 
by the traffickers 
colombia signed an extradition treaty 10 years ago because it is 
generally regarded as impossible to find a colombian judge who 
would handle such an extradition 
it is common knowledge in colombia that judges are often bribed 
or threatened into making decisions favorable to drug traffickers 
four judges have been killed by traffickers since the drug 
crackdown began aug 18 
earlier this month the medellin cartel the countrys largest 
said it was willing to stop its cocaine business give up hostages 
it had kidnapped the last two months and stop all terrorism 
the communique did not specify what the traffickers wanted in 
return but it appeared they were asking for assurances they would 
not be extradited to the united states 
barco has sent confusing signals to the public in responding to 
the communique on the one hand he has said the government position 
would not change but he also has said the government is not 
inflexible suggesting there could be some settlement 
medellin cartel chief pablo escobar who earlier this week sent 
a letter to el tiempo and cali cartel leader rodriguez have denied 
they are behind any terrorism in the drug war 
drug traffickers have been blamed for 262 bombings and other 
terrorist acts that have claimed 209 deaths since the midaugust 
crackdown 
those casaulties include all 106 persons aboard a colombian 
airliner that was bombed out of the sky near bogota 
since the crackdown began security forces have seized millions 
of dollars worth of mansions ranches office buildings planes 
yachts cars jewels and money belonging to suspected traffickers

an advertiser threatened to prosecute a paint 
brushwielding magician who made three innercity ads for booze 
and cigarettes disappear under a coat of white paint 
the whitewasher who uses the pseudonym mandrake after a comic 
strip magician and described himself as a 54yearold black 
professional said he was conducting a oneman civil disobedience 
campaign to erase a blight on the community 
i have seen over the past two years a disproportionate amount 
of advertising in the black and hispanic community said 
mandrake in a telephone interview in which he refused to give his 
real name i believe it was time for us to stand up and fight 
back 
tobacco and liquor producers were alarmed by the actions of 
mandrake whose painting of three south side billboards in broad 
daylight last week followed a muchpublicized outcry over a tobacco 
companys plan to target blacks in marketing a new brand of 
cigarettes 
hes obviously vandalizing private property said geoff 
obrzut a spokesman for patrick media whose billboard was covered 
a police report was filed obrzut said and we would be 
willing to prosecute if hes caught 
im a firm believer in the constitution and believe the law 
was broken mandrake conceded but at the same time there is a 
moral obligation a right that must be addressed 
gary miller a spokesman for the american tobacco institute in 
washington dc said billboards had no effect on young people 
who as a group become smokers primarily because of peer pressures 
and parental influence 
janet flynn of the distilled spirits council of the united 
states echoed millers remarks we restrict our advertising to 
responsible adult customers 
a lively debate over the ethics of aiming tobacco and alcohol 
ads at minorities came to a head last week when us health and 
human services secretary louis sullivan attacked an rj reynolds 
tobacco co plan to testmarket a new cigarette uptown in 
philadelphia starting feb 5 
while cigarette advertising already is targeted at minorities 
uptown apparently was the first brand to be created named and 
marketed specifically for blacks 
reynolds shelved its plans but sullivan said he would continue 
to campaign against such marketing including products aimed at 
women 
consumer groups alarmed at the high rates of smoking and 
drinkingrelated illnesses among innercity minorities say the 
producers have an obligation not to aim dangerous products at these 
groups 
industry representatives say their advertising strategies are 
protected by the first amendment and contend that people make their 
own decision about whether to light up or take a drink 
the lung cancer rate has increased four times faster among 
blacks than among whites during the past 30 years according to 
reports from the american lung association and the national cancer 
institute 
a 1987 study by the center for science in the public interest a 
washingtonbased health advocacy group found that black men have a 
70 percent higher death rate from cirrhosis of liver than whites 
the group contends that children are being encouraged by the 
billboard ads 
children on the way to school and back home or even at recess 
get the message that the way to be happy glamorous or athletic is 
to smoke andor drink one publication by the center said 
obrzut said that while 50 percent of billboard advertising does 
occur in the inner city only 16 percent of the citys 2500 ads 
are alcohol or tobaccorelated 
state sen miguel del valle of chicago has proposed legislation 
to ban the alcohol and cigarette ads within about two blocks of 
schools that and even stronger measures are to be reviewed by a 
governors task force

czechoslovakias foreign minister promised that 
the country will end its profitable arms exports immediately 
weapons just wont be sold anymore foreign minister jiri 
dienstbier said in an interview published in the new york times 
today 
czechoslovakias arms industries ranked seventh in total exports 
from 1984 through 1988 according to the stockholm international 
peace research institute 
czechoslovakia will simply end its trade in arms without 
taking into account what the pragmatists will say that it will be 
a blow to the state coffers that those people will get arms from 
somebody else anyway if we dont supply them dienstbier said 
britain and other countries have charged that terrorist groups 
have obtained czechoslovakmade explosives such as semtex which 
british authorities say was used in the bombing of pan am flight 
103 over scotland in 1988 
dienstbier a former dissident who two months ago was shoveling 
coal in a menial boilerroom job as punishment also said 
negotiations with moscow to remove soviet troops from 
czechoslovakia were being complicated by the civil unrest in soviet

in cash 110 pounds of cocaine and a ton of marijuana authorities 
said 
two other metrodade officers were charged separately with 
cocaine violations wednesday 
us attorney dexter lehtinen said the indictments sent a 
message that officials in south florida were determined to root out 
corrupt officers no matter what their rank

officers

ripped off drug dealers of cash cocaine and marijuana from 1981 to 
1987 lehtinen said the defendants protected their racket by 
getting honest officers transferred to other assignments he said 
they would come into the possession of information about where 
drug dealers were where illegal drugs were and should have 
engaged in proper law enforcement activities lehtinen said 
instead they would steal the drugs engage in what in the street 
might be called a ripoff and subsequently resell those drugs 
those indicted included maj roberto gonzalez 40 chief of 
metrodades central division his 43yearold brother detective 
jose gonzalez detective mario beovides 41 and businessmen jorge 
luis fonte 38 thomas rivera 33 and manuel rodriguez 57

chinese students in exile concede that 
the bill before the senate today to decide their future in the 
united states was largely symbolic but said it provided added 
protection from deportation 
they watched wednesday as the house voted 39025 to override 
president bushs nov 30 veto of a bill eliminating a requirement 
that chinese students return to their homeland before applying for 
a visa to return to america 
the matter moved to the senate where a vote scheduled for today 
was expected to be a cliffhanger 
people here want to make sure they stay here safely said an 
wei who works at the chinese student information center in newton 
a boston suburb 
many students were anxious about the prospect of being sent back 
to china where they faced probable political reprisals he said 
in philadelphia students also anxiously awaited the vote 
we need the law to protect ourselves said wei sun a 
32yearold graduate student in mechanical engineering at drexel 
university if the override is successful america will send a 
very strong message to the chinese government that we cannot 
tolerate what the chinese government has done 
pei min xin a leader of the prodemocracy protests in beijing 
last spring said he has learned that in china his name is on a 
blacklist of students in the movement 
if he were forced to return he would face life imprisonment or 
execution said pei 
he said he felt disillusioned by the presidents actions 
regarding china which has included dispatching two advisers there 
last year at a time when he was pubicly condemning the chinese 
government 
how can the leader of the united states be so accommodating to 
people back in our own country who tried to kill us all off to 
stamp out our legitimate demands for political change said pei 
a harvard university graduate student in government 
fleeing china after the beijing demonstrations were crushed in 
june the students in exile first gathered in paris to form the 
front for a democratic china an umbrella organization of the 
prodemocracy movement 
many including wuer kaixi the chinese governments 
mostwanted student dissident are studying in the boston area and 
coordinating prodemocracy activities among their peers 
pei is one of about 32000 chinese in the united states who hold 
visas that require them to return to china when the visas expire 
and live there for two years before they can apply for a new one 
president bush vetoed the bill eliminating that requirement 
saying it was unnecessary because he signed an administrative order 
allowing chinese students to stay in the united states 
bush attempting to stymie override votes in the house and 
senate said the measure could damage us relations with china 
which has condemned the legislation and threatened to curtail 
exchange programs if it becomes law 
chinese students who have lobbied congress on the issue said 
the override was crucial because an administrative order was not as 
solid as a law the process of revoking an order is easier and 
could happen at any time if the situation changes they said 
people would feel a lot more secure if theyre staying here 
because of a law an said

discovery of a genetic defect that apparently 
causes one kind of retinitis pigmentosa may help researchers find 
defects that cause other forms of the visionrobbing disease 
scientists said 
study of genetic defects may reveal leads for devising 
treatments for the inherited condition they added 
retinitis pigmentosa which afflicts about 100000 americans 
gradually progresses from night blindness to tunnel vision to 
blindness symptoms are caused by degeneration of the retina a 
delicate layer of cells at the back of the eye that detects images 
and relays them to the brain 
the newly discovered defect apparently keeps the eye from 
producing a fully functional version of an important protein 
researchers said 
the new work is reported in todays issue of the british journal 
nature by eliot berson thaddeus dryja and colleagues at the 
massachusetts eye and ear infirmary in boston 
it focuses on the autosomal dominant form of retinitis 
pigmentosa which accounts for perhaps 43000 cases in the united 
states said jeanette felix director of science for the 
baltimorebased rp foundation fighting blindness 
the genetic defect the researchers found may be responsible for 
about 5000 of those cases she said but the studys impact may go 
beyond that because it focuses attention on a particular gene and 
further work may turn up more defects in that gene that cause other 
forms of the disease she said 
in addition the researchers wrote the finding suggests that 
other genes that play similar roles in the eye should be studied 
for defects that cause other forms of retinitis pigmentosa 
the researchers studied the gene that tells eye cells how to 
make a protein called rhodopsin this lightsensing substance plays 
a major role in vision during twilight and it is found in the 
rod cells of the eyes the first to die in retinitis pigmentosa 
the defect appeared in rhodopsin genes from 17 of 148 unrelated 
patients with retinitis pigmentosa but not in any of 102 people 
without the disease the researchers reported 
it is unclear how the defect causes the disease they said 
scientists must answer that question by introducing the 
defective gene into experimental animals and studying the result 
felix said once the answer is found it may lead to experiments to 
find ways to block the disease process she said 
currently scientists do not know how to stop the progression of 
the disease she said 
the new finding allows specific diagnosis of one form of 
retinitis pigmentosa and accurate genetic counseling for those who 
have the genetic defect said meredithe applebury of the university 
of chicago 
such people have a 50 percent chance of passing the 
diseasecausing defect on to their children she said in an 
editorial accompanying the report in nature

the boy pleaded innocent wednesday to junvilecourt charges of 
car theft evading arrest and violating the tennessee drivers

after the deputy flicked on his blue lights and siren the chase 
ended when two truckers helped form a moving roadblock and 
chambers forced the car over 
the boy who was barefoot when he got out of the car said he 
had learned to drive by watching his mother according to chambers

reputed mob boss john gotti speaks of hiring 
them irish guys in a transcript that prosecutors provided as 
evidence that gotti paid an irishamerican gang to shoot and wound 
a union official 
gotti and an associate anthony guerrieri 60 are charged with 
assault and conspiracy in the revenge shooting of john f oconnor 
former vice president of carpenters union local 608 on may 7 1986 
prosecutors say gotti hired the westies a gang from the hells 
kitchen neighborhood to shoot oconnor in the buttocks because he 
had thugs vandalize the bankers and brokers restaurant owned by 
gotti associate philip philly modica 
oconnor who recovered will not testify at gottis trial 
assistant district attorney michael cherkasky told the jury 
oconnor is corrupt and has been indicted on various charges 
transcripts released in court wednesday of conversations 
secretly taped by the police show at least one mention by gotti of 
the restaurant and several comments on the westies 
at one point gotti says theyre doing something for me 
them irish guys but does not say what 
at another point gotti refers to james coonan as my friend 
who is the leader of the west side gang irish guys he also 
says hes on the payroll and he gets it legitimately 
the transcripts also show gotti wanted to be an executivetype 
crime leader whose underlings respected an underworld chain of 
command 
prosecutors say gotti 49 became leader of the gambino mob 
largest of the five new york organized crime gangs in december 
1985 after paul castellano the former boss was shot dead in front 
of a steakhouse 
on a jan 11 1986 tape gotti tells an unidentified man me 
and you may socialize but i cant socialize with these guys i 
cant bring myself down im a boss you know what i mean 
his annoyance with longtime associate angelo ruggieros 
familiarity during business hours seems apparent on another tape 
when he says i told ange you gotta forget them liberties you 
take take em when were alone 
gotti apparently had just made ruggiero a caporegime crew 
captain according to the tape transcripts and was not satisfied 
that his friend was acting like a leader ruggiero a defendant in 
the oconnor case with gotti died of natural causes in december 
the tapes were introduced by edward wright an investigator with 
the states organized crime task force he said the alleged 
mobsters suspecting they might be under surveillance turned on 
hair dryers flushed toilets and whispered to try to make 
conversations inaudible 
prosecutors say they have more than 1000 cassettes of secretly 
recorded conversations including some where mobsters and 
associates praise gotti as jesus christ and gods gift to the 
underworld

jesse jacksons syndicated talk show is on line 
for next fall and it could continue to run in most of the country 
even if he became a candidate for mayor of washington dc the 
shows distributor says 
jackson has given assurances hell do the weekly onehour tv 
series voices of america with jesse jackson said barry stagg 
a spokesman for warner bros domestic television distribution 
the series to be produced by composer quincy jones and 
jacksons production company would debut in september 
the program has been picked by 82 stations covering 60 per cent 
of the national audience stagg said by phone wednesday from warner 
offices in burbank calif 
there has been speculation that jackson might run for mayor of 
washington in the wake of the cocaine arrest of mayor marion barry 
jackson has refused to confirm his political plans 
were jackson to seek office in washington while his show is on 
the air the federal communications commissions equal time rules 
for opposing candidates would go into force but only in the 
greater washington viewing area 
the rules require that stations that provide air time to a 
qualified political candidate must afford equal opportunity on the 
air to opposing candidates who ask for the time said milton gross 
an fcc official 
no station in washington has bought jacksons series stagg 
said but the show has been purchased by wmartv in nearby 
baltimore 
because wmars signal is seen in washington that station 
wouldnt air the series until any election race ended if 
jackson sought election as washingtons mayor said arnold j 
kleiner wmars president 
wed like very much to run it he said we think its 
going to be a good show jesse jackson is certainly an interesting 
personality an interesting person one who always has something to 
say 
but if he runs for office i believe we would be locked into 
the equal time constraints we would not be willing to give 
jacksons opponents equal time so we probably would not run the 
show 
production of jacksons series probably will start this summer 
and may be done in washington stagg said

china today strongly condemned a vote in the 
house of representatives to protect chinese students in the united 
states and said passage of the legislation would do serious 
harm to uschinese relations 
the house voted 39025 wednesday to override president bushs 
veto of legislation that would allow chinese students many of whom 
face possible political persecution at home to overstay their us 
visas 
foreign ministry spokesman jin guihua said the house had based 
its policy on rumors fully revealing its antichina position 
we express great indignation and strongly condemn this 
hegemonist act of the us house of representatives jin told a 
weekly briefing 
should the us senate also adopt such a bill it would 
certainly do serious harm to sinous relations and further impair 
the cultural and educational exchanges between the two countries 
the legislation applies to some 32000 chinese students many of 
whom openly criticized the chinese government after its bloody 
suppression of the prodemocracy movement last spring 
the senate was to vote on the bill today and bush was pressing 
republican senators to oppose the veto override which needs a 
twothirds vote of both chambers to pass 
bush who says it is important to maintain channels of contact 
with the chinese leadership has initiated administrative measures 
that provide chinese students similar guarantees against forced 
deportation 
jin did not say how the chinese might retaliate if the student 
bill becomes law warning only that the united states must take 
prompt and effective measures to prevent the deterioration of the 
situation 
nearly half of all chinese students abroad are in the united 
states and any chinese decision to curtail exchange programs would 
affect thousands of students in china applying for overseas studies 
jin said congress was trying to obstruct students from returning 
for service in their home country and accused us lawmakers of 
supporting the reactionary front for democracy in china and the 
chinese democratc alliance 
the two groups based in paris and new york are operated by 
prodemocracy chinese exiles the front was organized by dissidents 
who fled the country after the june military crackdown on the 
prodemocracy movement in which hundreds of unarmed civilians were 
killed 
jin also took a hardline stance on two other dissidents 
astrophysicist fang lizhi and his wife li shuxian who have been 
given refuge in the us embassy in beijing since june 
jin said the two are criminals wanted by chinas security 
organs and that the united states was breaking international law 
by harboring them 
his statements echoed the stance china had taken before us 
national security adviser brent scowcroft visited beijing in 
december that vsiit appeared to set the two countries on a course 
of improved relations

the judge in the trial of six white youths 
charged in the death of a black teenager ruled for the second day 
in a row that police had bungled procedures and a defendants 
statement could not be used in court 
state judge thaddeus owens said wednesday he would not allow 
prosecutors to use a statement to police by defendant joseph 
serrano because police had refused to allow serrano to be alone 
with his lawyer 
any time a lawyer cant go talk to his client without somebody 
looking over his shoulder its a sad day for the constitution 
said owens 
serrano 20 is charged with murder manslaughter assault and 
other crimes in the aug 23 attack on yusuf hawkins who was shot 
in the chest after he and three friends were surrounded by a mob of 
young whites 
hawkins and his companions all black were attacked when they 
went to the mostly white bensonhurst section of brooklyn to look at 
a used car 
on tuesday owens ruled that another defendants admission of 
involvement in the crime was illegally obtained 
owens said detectives who took pasquale raucci 19 into custody 
shortly after the murder failed to advise him of his rights to 
remain silent or to hire a lawyer 
after the hearing prosecutor ed boyar said there would be 
separate trials for three defendants keith mondello 19 charles 
stressler 21 and steven curreri 19 
curreri is not charged with murder 
the alleged triggerman joseph fama 19 may be tried together 
with raucci and serrano boyar said 
owens has set the first trial for march 5 but hasnt said who 
would be tried first

a consumer group began a campaign against 
disposable products today urging environmentally concerned 
shoppers to telephone their displeasure to manufacturers tollfree 
consumer lines 
the new york public interest research group published a guide to 
what it said were the worst examples of disposable overpackaged 
and nonrecyclable consumer products that deplete resources and jam 
landfills 
although it did not call for a boycott the group urged 
consumers to complain about items such as disposable diapers and 
razors plastic utensils polystyrene foam packages and socalled 
degradable plastic bags 
given the garbage disposal crisis across much of the country 
consumers need to send these companies a clear message that they 
dont want and dont need these socalled convenience items and 
overpackaged products steven a romalewski the guides author 
said in an interview 
the guide singled out a few items as examples of the worst in 
throwaway packaging including eastman kodak cos fling 
disposable camera quaker oats cos aunt jemima pancake 
express which has mix for six pancakes in a disposable plastic 
mixing bowl and heinz usas plastic ketchup bottles 
the ketchup bottles are difficult to recycle because they are 
made of laminated layers of plastics the guide said 
juiceinabox containers used by more than a halfdozen fruit 
drink producers pose the same problem because they contain layered 
plastic aluminium foil and paper it said 
while degradable plastic bags have been promoted as a 
partial solution to the landfill crisis the guide cited complaints 
from environmental groups that the bags only break down into 
smaller plastic particles which remain in the environment 
it also said they may not break down when buried and could 
weaken products made from recycled plastic 
especially at a time when industries are trying to cash in on 
the green decade and this new environmentalism they cant just try 
to give the appearance that theyre doing good for the 
environment romalewski said they have to take some tough 
action 
heinz spokeswoman beth adams however said her company was 
between a rock and a hard place because consumers prefer 
plastic bottles and only the nonrecyclable kind are airproof 
enough to keep ketchup from darkening 
she said heinz in pittsburgh continues to sell glass bottles 
though they now make up only about 35 percent of its bottled 
ketchup sales and is searching fast and furious for a 
recyclable plastic bottle it can use 
at kodak in rochester ny spokeswoman holly walkland read a 
letter prepared for customers who complain about the fling 
camera maintaining that it does not contain significantly more 
material than some film cartridges 
quaker oats spokesman ron bottrell in chicago had no comment 
romalewski said boycotts seldom work unless targeted at a 
specific product but the public interest group hopes to make its 
point by listing the telephone numbers of nearly two dozen 
companies whose products it criticized and urging consumers to 
call 
the 20page guide is being distributed to consumer and 
environmental groups across the country copies are available for

a jury awarded nearly 1 million to three 
mexicans who claimed that sheriffs deputies used excessive force 
during an altercation that was videotaped 
the three san bernardino county sheriffs deputies were ordered 
to pay 956000 to auro ruiz victor serrano and efren serrano 
nazitype conduct does not go down well in the united states 
and thats what the jury said said attorney stephen yagman 
retained by the mexican government to represent the laborers 
defense attorney david lawrence said he had not decided if he 
would appeal 
the altercation occurred in june 1988 when the officers 
responded to complaints about a loud party at a house in 
victorville 70 miles northeast of downtown los angeles 
the plaintiffs testified they were beaten and harassed without 
provocation but deputies said some of the men assaulted officers 
when they tried to arrest them 
the videotape which was shown to the sixmember jury appeared 
to prove the mens contentions the deputies testified that a 
segment showing them being assaulted was cut from the tape 
the us district court jury wednesday awarded victor serrano 
150000 in compensatory damages and 150000 in punitive damages 
against deputy mark swagger and awarded serranos father efren 
60000 in compensatory damages and 56000 in punitive damages 
against sgt tim miller 
the panel awarded auro ruiz 250000 in compensatory damages 
250000 in punitive damages against sgt john gocke and 40000 in 
punitive damages against sgt tim miller 
under state law the county will pay the compensatory damages 
and the board of supervisors may vote on whether to pay punitive 
damages as well lawrence said

two vietnamese men slashed themselves in the 
stomach today at a detention center for boat people in what a 
witness said was a protest of the policy of forced repatriation 
the incident came a day after reports of boat people threatening 
suicide to protest forced repatriation and the screening process 
that determines which vietnamese can be resettled overseas as 
refugees 
the two men aged 36 and 39 refused medical treatment after 
being taken to a hospital where they were conscious in an 
observation ward according to a government spokesman who declined 
to be identified 
he described their condition as not so serious and said the 
men were being interviewed by staff of the united nations high 
commissioner for refugees 
an expatriate relief worker who said he witnessed the incident 
said the two men slashed their stomaches with knives in the un 
agencys office at the whitehead detention center this morning 
we cannot call it suicide said the relief worker i think 
it is their way of communication they are trying to get 
attention to protest forced repatriation 
earlier this month two other men at the detention center 
stabbed themselves in the stomach they both survived 
whitehead is one of several camps housing a total of about 
44000 boat people who face repatriation against their will unless 
they can prove they fled persecution in their communist homeland 
about onequarter of whiteheads 20000 inmates already have 
been classified as illegal immigrants to be repatriated it was not 
clear whether the two men who stabbed themselves were among those 
whose pleas for refugee status were rejected 
the cramped squalid detention centers have been particularly 
tense since dec 12 when 51 boat people were whisked onto an 
airplane by security forces and forcibly repatriated to hanoi 
thousands of vietnamese in the detention centers peacefully 
protested the forced repatriation policy in the following days 
although rioting erupted in one camp when security forces attempted 
a check for homemade weapons

belgium plans to withdraw its 25000 
troops from west germany and has asked nato to stop insisting that 
it raise its defense budget by 5 percent defense minister guy 
coeme was quoted as saying today 
his comments make belgium the first nato ally to suggest troop 
cuts far beyond those now being negotiated in eastwest talks in 
vienna 
in interviews with two respected dailies coeme said that given 
the dramatic thaw in eastwest relations it is no longer realistic 
for belgium to have troops in neighboring west germany 
the way the situation in europe is now evolving the 
withdrawal of belgian troops from germany becomes likely he told 
de standaard 
in an interview with the daily le soir coeme said we are 
moving from the era of eastwest confrontation to that of 
collaboration of mutual respect how can we justify the status 
quo on our side the maintenance of our troops in germany 
his remarks follow demands by warsaw pact members poland 
hungary and czechoslovakia for a quick and total removal of soviet 
troops from their territories 
belgium maintains 25000 troops in the central west germany at 
an annual cost of 694 million 
in addition to seeking the withdrawal of belgian troops from 
west germany coeme said he has written nato secretary general 
manfred woerner asking that belgium no longer be required to 
increase its annual defense outlays by 5 percent 
he said nato was reacting too slowly to events in east europe 
and added it is important which signal nato now sends to east 
europe 
belgiums 1989 defense budget totaled 28 billion 
in the early 1980s the north atlantic treaty organization set a 
goal under which its 16 members would boost their annual defense 
budgets by at least 3 percent 
several nato members notably belgium have long failed to meet 
the target citing financial problems in the meantime the target 
has been raised to 5 percent for belgium to make up for the lag 
the nato alliance had no immediate reaction to coemes comments

richard v secord sentenced to probation for 
his role in the irancontra affair is accusing former president 
reagan of not supporting the participants in the scandal 
i think former president reagan has been hiding out i think 
its cowardly secord told a news conference after his sentencing 
on wednesday 
i think that he should have stood up and taken the heat 
just as previous presidents have done in failed covert 
operations secord said but instead of that reagans aides 
built a wall around him 
secord was placed on probation for two years by us district 
court judge aubrey robinson the retired air force major general 
pleaded guilty nov 8 to making a false statement when he told 
congressional investigators he was unaware any money from the 
irancontra affair had benefited north 
a focus of the threeyear probe by independent counsel lawrence 
walsh secord used money from the maze of offshore companies and 
secret bank accounts in the irancontra operation to pay for oliver 
l norths security system 
secord told the judge he would regret the false statement for 
the rest of his life 
secord also told the news conference he would mount an attack 
against the federal law authorizing courtappointed independent 
counsels 
secord said the law is a monster that is probably 
unconstitutional and he hopes to encourage research on the matter 
with a fundraising effort that will lead to a drive against the 
statute 
i have been involved in this witchhunt for too long to stop 
now secord said 
the supreme court upheld the constitutionality of the ethics in 
government act on a 71 vote but secord said the issues in the 
case were narrowly drawn he said the independent counsel statute 
enacted in 1977 in response to the firing during the watergate 
scandal of special prosecutor archibald cox should be challenged 
again 
secord who has met repeatedly with irancontra prosecutors 
since his guilty plea may be called as a government witness in the 
upcoming trial of former national security adviser john poindexter 
meanwhile north convicted of three charges in the irancontra 
scandal sent a letter recently to supporters who have contributed 
to his legal defense saying he is considering becoming the head of 
a taxexempt organization called the freedom alliance 
the group would be dedicated to promoting a strong national 
defense supporting those who struggle for freedom throughout the 
world maintaining traditional american values and countering 
the leftwing dominated national media said the letter 
it also would support the antiabortion movement and encourage 
grassroots political activity according to the letter 
at an office where supporters of north have been raising money 
for his legal defense one north backer duane ward declined to 
comment wednesday on the matter 
north is appealing his convictions for aiding and abetting an 
obstruction of congress altering and destroying national security 
council documents and accepting a 13800 home security system from 
secord

legislation creating a cabinetlevel 
department of the environment is expected to move swiftly through 
congress with sponsors saying they hope to send it to president 
bush in time for signing on earth day in april 
bush endorsed the bipartisan legislation wednesday saying 
the environmental challenges that face america and the world are 
so important that they must be addressed from the highest level of 
our government 
his move drew praise from environmentalists and both democrats 
and republicans on capitol hill but several senators suggested the 
president must do more than elevate the status of the environmental 
protection agency to deal with the worlds environmental problems 
its not enough just to put an extra chair to the cabinet 
table said sen al gore dtenn who has been a past critic of 
the bush administrations actions on such environmental matters as 
global warming and atmospheric ozone depletion 
sen timothy wirth dcolo said giving the epa higher 
visibility is nice frosting but added wheres the cake he 
accused the administration of dragging its feet in exerting 
leadership in international efforts on global warming and other 
environmental issues 
but the presidents decision to call for elevating the status of 
the epa a regulatory agency created in 1970 to the cabinet 
brought salutes from sponsors of the bipartisan legislation and 
from many environmentalists who said the white house support makes 
passage all but certain 
its a welcomed breath of fresh air said rep john conyers 
dmich one of the cosponsors and chairman of the house government 
operations committee 
conyers said he hoped a bill could clear congress within 90 
days the president is said to want a bill ready for his signature 
as part of the earth day 20th anniversary celebrations april 22 
sen john glenn dohio chairman of the senate government 
affairs committee also said he would move quickly on the bill with 
hearings scheduled for next month 
epa administrator william k reilly said today that the creation 
of a cabinet department is a message internationally that the 
environment is moving now into the mainstream for a whole range of 
policies economic policies energy policies foreign policies of 
all sorts 
it also has another effect domestically reilly said on 
abctvs good morning america program when the epa 
administrator is doing his job he is in everybody elses hair 
whether its wetlands or water policy or dams or transportation 
projects energy facilities this is a wonderful way of saying 
that the environment belongs at the big table 
while the epas influence is broad the agency has toiled far 
from the focus of power during most of its two decades 
when reilly an environmentalist by profession was sworn in as 
epa administrator shortly after bush took office it was the first 
time a president had visited the epas headquarters in southwest 
washington 
the agency with 16000 employees and an annual budget of more 
than 5 billion would become the 15th cabinetlevel department 
the cabinet was last expanded in 1988 when the department of 
veterans affairs was added 
congressional and administration sources said the proposal 
before congress would not change the agency significantly in 
structure or size one exception would be creation of a bureau of 
environmental statistics to keep tabs on environmental data 
but elevation to cabinet secretary would give the epa 
administrator more clout within the government and increased 
prestige in dealings with other countries say environmentalists 
and congressional supporters of the change although reilly attends 
many cabinet meetings he does not as a routine sit at the table 
its a different dynamic to have a seat at the table said 
frederick krupp executive director of the environmental defense 
fund finally we would have a secretary of the environment who 
can bring things up at cabinet meeting as well as react to the 
harebrained ideas of the secretary of defense or whoever 
but michael fischer executive director of the sierra club 
cautioned elevating the epa to the cabinet is no substitute for 
the president himself being a leader for strong environmental 
legislation and worldwide environmental negotiations

a judge today rejected an 
application to free a white former police captain allegedly 
involved in a secret terror network that harassed and assassinated 
antiapartheid activists 
the suspect ferdinand barnard has been held without charge 
since oct 31 as part an investigation into the assassinations last 
year of two white activists johannesburg university lecturer david 
webster and namibian lawyer anton lubowski 
pretoria supreme court justice hj priess rejected a bid by 
barnards father a retired police colonel to have the former 
narcotics detective released 
in windhoek namibia another supreme court judge today set 
april 18 as the start of a murder trial for donald acheson a 
suspected accomplice of barnard who is accused of involvement in 
lubowksis killing 
lubowski shot and killed outside his windhoek home on sept 12 
was the only white to hold a leadership position in namibias 
independence movement the southwest african peoples 
organization webster a wellknown human rights activist was shot 
and killed outside his johannesburg home on may 1 
police brig floris mostert in testimony opposing barnards 
release said the investigation into the assassinations had 
uncovered the existence of a secret organization with members 
from all levels of society which strives to terrorize leftwing 
radicals with the aid of violence and intimidation 
dozens of antiapartheid activists have been the victims of 
unsolved murders in recent years many others have had their cars 
vandalized and there have been bombings or arson attacks on 
offices of militant trade unions civil rights groups and 
opposition newspapers 
mostert said barnard had been in contact with acheson prior to 
lubowskis murder the brigadier also said i must respectfully 
stress that the nature of my investigation is extremely sensitive 
and that the secrecy of the information which i possess is of the 
utmost importance 
police say the websterlubowski case is not directly related to 
investigations of claims that death squads within the ranks of the 
national police force killed government opponents on the orders of 
highranking officers 
one black expoliceman butana nofemela has pleaded guilty to 
committing a murder as part of such a death squad and a white 
former captain dirk coetzee has fled abroad after telling a 
newspaper he commanded a death squad 
thus far legal steps have been taken only against nofemela and 
coetzee not against other policemen implicated by them this has 
resulted in widespread demands for an independent judicial inquiry 
and accusations that president fw de klerks government is 
engaged in a coverup 
some of the white officers implicated by coetzee appeared today 
at an inquest into the deaths of four young black activists in 
1986 the policemen have denied allegations that the youths were 
murdered saying they were shot in selfdefense by a special 
counterinsurgency unit

a black man who claimed he was framed 
for the murder of a white student during school racial turmoil in 
1974 must serve his life sentence without parole gov buddy roemer 
said 
roemer on wednesday rejected a pardon board recommendation that 
gary tylers sentence be reduced to 60 years which would make him 
eligible for parole in 1995 
gary tyler was found guilty after a full jury trial roemer 
said in a statement his conviction has been reviewed extensively 
by the courts over the past 15 years those reviewing courts have 
found gary tylers trial to be fundamentally fair by all legal 
standards also i believe his efforts toward rehabilitation have 
not been sufficient 
at a dec 14 hearing the pardon board was presented with 
petitions from amnesty international and other groups that had 
collected 12000 signatures 
the boards vote was 32 with the three black members for 
clemency and the two whites against none would comment 
opposition came from prosecutors and from the family of the 
victim 13yearold timothy weber i know it had to be hard for 
the governor im sure but he made my day said leah weber 
mother of the dead boy 
tylers attorney mary howell read a statement from tyler 31 
that said this decision doesnt discourage me whatsoever in 
continuing my battle to win my freedom and to show those out there 
that i am innocent 
tyler was a 15yearold activist for school desegregation in 
1974 when whites and blacks clashed at destrehan high school he 
was among a group of blacks aboard a school bus that had been 
surrounded by whites hurling bottles and rocks a shot fired from 
the bus killed weber standing with his mother across the 
schoolyard 
witnesses said the pistol was held by a gloved hand tyler was 
the only one on the bus wearing gloves police said 
tylers supporters say that a student who testified against him 
was a known liar and that police planted a pistol found in the 
stuffing of the torn seat where tyler had sat 
an allwhite jury sentenced tyler to the electric chair but the 
sentence was reduced to life when the supreme court struck down 
louisianas death penalty law in 1976 
tylers lawyer said the governor was incorrect in saying the 
courts found the trial to be fair by all legal standards 
the 5th us circuit court of appeal said the trial was 
fundamentally unfair that there was a presumption of guilt she 
said but the court would not order a new trial because the 
lawyer failed to object

a top official in one of chinas largest ethnic 
minority areas ordered armed police officials to intensify 
antiriot training and intelligence work as a prevention against 
unrest 
we soberly see that some unstable factors still exist and 
must heighten our vigilance and prepare for possible 
disturbances said wang enmao chairman of the xinjiang uygur 
autonomous regions advisory committee 
his remarks were quoted in the jan 19 xinjiang daily which 
arrived in beijing on today 
in other developments today 
china criticized czechoslovakia and the soviet union two 
former socialist allies over separate cases it said constituted 
interference in chinas internal affairs 
a foreign ministry spokesman confirmed that beijingbased 
foreign correspondents no longer will have to apply 10 days in 
advance for press coverage of events outside the capital 
however the spokesman jin guihua made clear at a news 
briefing that under new regulations announced saturday foreign 
reporters still will have to receive permission from local 
authorities for all trips outside beijing 
regarding the ethnic minority areas wang indicated that the 
danger existed of both ethnic unrest and politically inspired 
counterrevolutionary rebellion such as the government says took 
place in beijing during the spring when students demanded 
democratic reform 
we must strengthen training with regard to preventing and 
supressing disturbances and strengthen intelligence work in 
order to promptly and accurately understand the situation wang 
said the armed police must stay in close contact with the 
peoples of each ethnic group and obtain the support of the people 
of each 
the report did not say if wangs meeting with top officials of 
the peoples armed police in xinjiang a vast region in far 
northwestern china inhabited mainly by moslem minorities was 
triggered by the ethnic strife in the soviet union 
xinjiangs moslems have rioted from time to time most recently 
in may when moslems in urumchi took to the streets in anger over a 
chinese book they said slandered their religion 
china has refrained from any comment on the fighting between 
moslem azerbaijanis and christian armenians in the soviet caucasus 
region 
jin asked at a news briefing today if chinese newspapers had 
been told not to report heavily on the soviet riots said it was up 
to each newspaper to decide he added i believe there is no 
implication for the minority nationalities in china 
chinas official media have given the soviet strife routine 
coverage with brief stories on the international pages of 
newspapers including the xinjiang daily and reports on national 
television and radio 
as usual the media also have carried a steady diet of reports 
stressing the need for unity among ethnic groups which china calls 
nationalities 
regions inhabited by minority groups are among chinas poorest 
regarding czechoslovakia jin reproached its new president 
vaclav havel for inviting exiled tibetan spiritual leader the 
dalai lama to visit 
jin said the dalai lama was an exile long engaged in 
activities aimed at splitting china and that havels invitation 
for the buddhist monk to visit in february even in a private 
capacity cannot but be regarded as a political action involving 
gross interference in chinas internal affairs 
jin said the foreign ministry has made solemn and strong 
representations to the czechoslovak embassy in china asking the 
czechoslovak side to withdraw its invitation to dalai after careful 
consideration 
the dalai lama who lives in exile in india is deeply revered 
by the people of tibet scene of violent proindependence and 
antichinese riots over the past two years 
china accused the soviet union of violating its sovereignty by 
reportedly sending a delegation to taiwan to discuss the 
possibility of direct air flights jin referring to the soviet air 
talks with taiwans china airlines said the beijing government was 
resolutely opposed to any foreign airlines starting air service 
with taiwan 
this is by no means nongovernmental economic or trade in the 
ordinary sense but rather a political issue involving chinas 
sovereignty 
he said consultations with china are a must before such a 
step is taken and we hope that the countries concerned act with 
prudence in this matter 
china regards taiwan as a breakaway province it tolerates 
economic and trade relations between taiwan and foreign countries 
but strongly opposes any kind of official ties between taiwan and 
countries that have diplomatic relations with beijing

a foreign ministry spokesman confirmed today that 
foreign correspondents based in beijing no longer will have to 
apply 10 days in advance to cover events outside the capital 
spokesman jin guihua however made clear at a news briefing 
that under new regulations announced saturday foreign reporters 
still need permission from local authorities for all trips outside 
beijing 
consequently local officials still have the authority to bar 
foreign reporters from covering demonstrations natural disasters 
or other breaking events 
the 10day rule was imposed in 1986 but generally ignored until 
october 1987 when authorities in the tibetan capital lhasa 
invoked it to expel foreign reporters who had gone there to cover 
antichinese riots 
lhasa has been under martial law since march and with rare 
exceptions all applications by journalists to visit the city have 
been rejected 
jin said the ministry had taken into consideration the views 
put forward by foreign journalists in the past concerning the 
10day rule and that the new regulations omitted the rule to 
facilitate the press coverage in china by foreign journalists 
he stressed that the regulations require all foreign journalists 
to obtain permission from local foreign affairs offices before 
leaving beijing for reporting in other parts of the country 
asked about clauses in the new regulations saying journalists 
may lose their accreditation if they distort the facts create 
rumors or use improper methods to interview or report jin urged 
journalists to follow the regulations 
foreign correspondents need not worry so long as they abide by 
the regulations and observe their professional ethics and make 
legitimate press coverage in china he said the chinese 
government has all along dealt with cases according to facts and 
according to law 
after the suppression of prodemocracy protests in june chinese 
authorities expelled two american journalists who had been based in 
beijing and ordered half a dozen reporters who had come from 
outside china to cover the political turmoil to leave the country 
the journalists were accused of violating martial law 
regulations on news coverage under martial law which was lifted 
in beijing earlier this month all interviews had to be approved by 
military authorities

deaths of seven patients over the past three months 
the patients were moved out of detroit receiving hospitals 
surgical intensive care ward wednesday night so that it could be 
thoroughly cleaned hospital spokesman dennis archambault said 
our concern in evacuating the patients is that we have people 
with open wounds or who are physically weak from surgeries who are 
more susceptible to this kind of infection he said 
earlier wednesday doctors identified the bacterium determined 
it came from within the hospital and linked it to the deaths of the 
seven patients recovering from surgery he said 
detroit receiving is a 340bed hospital that treats critically 
injured patients such as those with gunshot or knife wounds said 
spokeswoman diane cooper its only elective surgery is for burn 
patients she said it is a unit of the private notforprofit 
detroit medical center 
there are always bacterial infections in a hospital and many 
are routinely treated archambault said this happens to be a 
particularly virulent form of bacterium infection 
archambault said the evacuated patients were exposed to or 
infected by acinetobacter calcoaceticus varanitratus or acv he 
said the patients are receiving antibiotics and other treatment 
dr norman hayner chief of the disease control for the state 
health department said bacteria such as acv are transmitted in a

three opposition parties today called 
on the provisional government to resign and allow a new 
broaderbased caretaker government to run the country until 
elections are held in may 
the call reflected mounting dissatisfaction with the national 
salvation front which has reversed its original promise not to get 
involved in romanias first free elections in more than 50 years 
promised for may 20 
the front took power in december during the bloody popular 
revolt that overthrew communist dictator nicolae ceausescu who was 
executed dec 25 along with his wife elena the front has had 
trouble earning the peoples trust ever since partly because some 
of its members are linked to the previous regime 
in a communique published in the newspaper romania libera the 
national peasant party national liberal party and the social 
democratic party of romania called for a new interim government to 
rule until the elections and said it should include all parties 
youth and former dissidents 
the three opposition parties which before world war ii 
dominated national politics recently became active again in 
romania 
in what appeared to be a conciliatory move the front called 
today on romanias 15 new or revived political parties to hold 
talks saturday on working out an election law to pave the way for 
the balloting bucharest radio said all political parties are 
invited to join the talks the report said 
a leading dissident poet ana blandiana also criticized the 
fronts announcement that it would field candidates telling 
romania libera that move was burdened with future dangers for 
the country 
illusions lasted only one month headlined the romania 
libera 
the fronts participation in the may elections could lead to 
reestablishing a single party under other forms and to missing 
perhaps definitively the chance that romania become a really 
democratic country the newspaper editorialized 
on wednesday 1000 people demonstrated outside the fronts 
headquarters to demand it not take part in the elections 
in response the front again published in todays newspapers its 
jan 3 decree outlawing demonstrations in bucharest and allowing 
them only in some parks unless they are approved by police 48 
hours in advance 
the announcement said those taking part in illegal protests 
could be sentenced to up to 30 days in jail or fined up to 250 
the peasant party which before world war ii dominated romanian 
politics with 2 million members condemned the fronts decision to 
contest the election and some of its members joined the bucharest 
demonstration wednesday 
todays communique indicated that the peasant party and two 
other revived groups prominent before the 1947 communist takeover 
have formed a virtual alliance against the front 
the threeparty statement said that by deciding to take part in 
the elections the front lost the neutrality needed to administer 
the balloting 
what kind of elections are we talking about when the national 
salvation front has monopolized in a totalitarian way all the key 
systems of the state the communique said the front has funds 
and controls television radio and the newspapers 
while the front has set up a nominally separate provisional 
government its executive council in fact makes all major 
governmental decisions 
the three parties accused the front of trying to usurp the 
revolution that overthrew ceausescus 24year rule this victory 
belongs to the people and cannot be confiscated by anyone it 
said 
it said the front is maintaining power under the pretext that 
some of its members were dissidents at a late hour or that they 
were shunted aside by the whims of the exdictator 
it repeated opposition charges that some members of the front 
were ceausescus henchmen and want to reinstate communist rule

rival shiite moslem militias skirmished 
in south lebanon today christian radio stations reached a 
compromise with christian leader gen michel aoun over news 
coverage and ended a weeklong strike 
police said at least five members of the proiranian hezbollah 
or party of god were wounded when a tank cannon round fired by 
gunmen of the mainstream shiite amal militia hit their position in 
the southern apple province 
a police spokesman also said overnight skirmishes with machine 
guns occurred between aouns soldiers and syrianbacked militias 
across beiruts dividing green line but that no injuries were 
reported 
by police count 98 people have been killed and 286 wounded in 
the latest round of amalhezbollah clashes for control of the 12 
million shiites since it broke out in the apple province on dec 
23 the more than 1 million shiites make up the largest segment of 
the 17 sects among lebanons 4 million people 
the amalhezbollah clashes continued despite efforts by iranian 
and algerian envoys to stop the fighting 
amalhezbollah battles renewed wednesday shattering a 16day 
relative lull that had prevailed over apple province the scene of 
a twoyear intermittent intershiite war which has killed 930 
people and wounded 2753 
christian radio stations resumed newscasts for the first time in 
a week today after the media in the christian enclave reached a 
compromise with aoun 
voice of lebanon and voice of free lebanon radio stations said 
the stations agreed to refer to syrianbacked president elias hrawi 
only as mr elias hrawi the compromise also allows the media 
to refer to aoun only as gen michel aoun and not as interim prime 
minister 
as soon as hrawi was elected president on nov 24 he dismissed 
aoun as army commander and interim prime minister however the 
54yearold general held out in the shellwrecked presidential 
palace and challenged hrawi to oust him from the 310squaremile 
christian enclave northeast of beirut 
aoun in a directive issued jan 16 banned the media from 
referring to hrawi as president and to salim hoss a sunni moslem 
as prime minister 
the directive also said the media should refer to parliament 
members as former legislators noting that aoun had declared the 
unicameral house dissolved to prevent the election of a 
syrianbacked president 
the compromise allows the media to refer to hoss as prime 
minister and to the legislators as parliamentary deputies said 
voice of lebanon which is controlled by the rightist phalange 
party 
aouns wrath was directed at the media in the christian enclave 
he banned two daily newspapers and a newsletter from publishing for 
a week each for defying his orders

four of mayor marion barrys bodyguards are 
being ordered to testify before a federal grand jury investigating 
the mayors ties to a convicted drug dealer according to sources 
the grand jury was meeting today to hear from two of the guards 
according to sources who spoke to the associated press on condition 
of anonymity 
the same grand jury heard testimony earlier in the week from 
rasheeda moore a friend of the mayor who helped lure barry into 
the fbi sting operation at a washington hotel where he allegedly 
smoked crack cocaine 
the sources said the officers called to testify include two who 
were with barry on the december 1988 night when he met with charles 
lewis a former city employee at a downtown washington hotel 
the federal probe of barry began after city police aborted an 
attempt to make an undercover drug buy from lewis who has since 
been convicted of drug charges the attempt was halted after 
authorities learned that the mayor was in lewis hotel room in 
downtown washington 
the sources identified two of the subpoenaed guards as city 
police officers james stays and joseph newman 
judy smith a spokeswoman for us attorney jay b stephens 
said she had no comment on whether the officers had been subpoenaed 
attempts to reach stays and newman by telephone were 
unsuccessful there were no answers at their homes 
meanwhile ms moore said through her lawyer wednesday that she 
would not respond to inquiries about her personal life or ties to 
the mayor moore returned wednesday to burbank calif where she 
lives 
ms moore missed a court date on tuesday in a drunken driving 
case the same day she was testifying before the washington grand 
jury an arrest warrant was issued when she failed to show for her 
hearing in van nuys municipal court officials said the judge 
however postponed the warrants release until jan 30 to give her 
time to appear a court clerk said 
ms moore was arrested on the drunken driving charge in north 
hollywood on new years day police said

two researchers havent come up with a cure for 
the common cold but they think theyve discovered a link to the 
cause of another common ailment flu 
they blame an overactive sun marked by a peak in its sunspot 
activity 
the solar connection was proposed in a letter to the editor in 
todays issue of the british journal nature by astronomer sir fred 
hoyle and his colleague nc wickramasinghe 
but an influenza researcher says he doubts that flu outbreaks 
are linked to solar activity 
there are many other attractive theories about what causes 
influenza outbreaks so i dont think we have to hypothesize that 
they come raining down from the atmosphere said paul glezen of 
the baylor college of medicine 
sunspots are dark markings that show up periodically on the sun 
on average the number of sunspots peaks every 11 years or so 
the analysis of the british researchers suggests that peak 
sunspot activity and flu pandemics have occurred at about the same 
time unusually often from 1761 to 1893 and from 1919 to 1979 
solar activity peaks when the number of sunspots is at a 
maximum the british researchers said 
electrical fields associated with intense solar winds can 
rapidly drive charged particles of the size of viruses down through 
the exposed upper atmosphere into the shelter of the lower 
atmosphere possibly causing the link to influenza they wrote 
but glezen an epidemiologist at baylors influenza research 
center said the idea doesnt sound too likely 
influenza viruses have a fatty covering that is not very stable 
outside the body so it is hard to imagine that a virus particle 
could be floating around for a very long time in the atmosphere and 
remain viable he said

president bush will propose providing more 
than 1 billion to help panama recover from the us military 
invasion and years of corrupt government us officials say 
the aid program being announced today will include development 
aid loan guarantees and programs to encourage investment said one 
official who insisted on anonymity 
about half of the program will be in cash and the remainder in 
credits the official said 
earlier wednesday bush told a news conference he was determined 
to try to help repair the wounds repair the damage 
i mourn the loss of innocent civilians in panama or anywhere 
else bush said but you have to look at the broad picture 
and then youve got to do whats right 
the official said the administration hopes other countries 
including japan and western european nations will follow the us 
lead and make contributions of their own 
the administration is still talking behind the scenes with 
leaders of congress about the panama aid package not all of its 
new money a senior administration official who asked not to be 
identified said wednesday night confirming the 1 billion figure 
bush also voiced hopes wednesday that soviet president mikhail 
gorbachev would not only survive but stay strong in the face of 
unprecedented domestic upheaval that threatens his stability 
regarding gorbachevs use of soviet troops to quell ethnic 
violence in the southern republic of azerbaijan bush said 
anytime you have a use of force and the loss of life we are 
concerned but i dont believe i can judge that question right 
now 
the panama aid package will include aid to rebuild houses that 
were demolished in the dec 20 invasion by us troops officials 
said however they said the package is unlikely to include any 
compensation for the survivors of more than 200 panamanian 
civilians who died in the invasion 
asked what he would say to the panamanian survivors bush said 
he would tell them look you lost some panamanian lives 
innocent life was lost and yet 92 percent of the people in panama 
strongly supported the action of the united states isnt that 
significant 
damage estimates from the invasion vary widely ranging from a 
few hundred million dollars to 2 billion or more the united 
states already has released 400 million in panamanian assets 
frozen in the united states in earlier efforts to topple the regime 
led by gen manuel antonio noriega ousted in the invasion 
if the program is approved panama would become one of the 
largest per capita aid recipients in the world after having spent 
more than two years as a target of us economic sanctions 
the united states suspended aid to panama in late 1987 and began 
a policy designed to starve the country economically in early 1988 
after noriegas indictment on drugtrafficking charges by two 
florida federal grand juries 
the result of the us actions was a steep decline in the 
panamanian economy producing a crisis that was aggravated by the 
us invasion 
the us official said the aid proposal will require a 
supplemental appropriation by the congress for part of the money 
but much of it will be paid through cuts from aid programs to other 
countries 
a big chunk will be out of the taxpayers pockets the 
official said predicting a tough fight in finding the money 
he said panama although a small country of about 2 million 
people requires substantial aid because successive military 
governments including noriegas stole a good portion of the 
national treasury 
panama is behind on its obligations to international lending 
institutions and its total foreign debt amounts to 534 million 
vice president dan quayle will take the specifics of the plan 
when he travels to panama this weekend for talks with the new 
government a white house official said 
also on wednesday bush presided at a fulldress military 
welcome for the president of north yemen ali abdullah saleh and 
hailed him as a man of extraordinary accomplishment at a state 
dinner 
saleh urged bush to prod israel to give palestinians in the 
occupied territories the right of selfdetermination bush assured 
his guest of americas commitment to security in the middle east 
and to the pursuit of a just and lasting peace

a popular politician who quit the communist 
party said today that east germany never developed its own identity 
during 40 years of communist rule and that reunification with west 
germany is unavoidable 
the east german government said it has lifted all barriers to 
competition between companies and that foreign investors may buy 
majority shares of enterprises here if the projects are in the 
publics economic interest 
the announcement by economics minister christa luft is a major 
concession to western businesses which had shown little interest 
in joint ventures and other investments when the government said it 
would limit foreign ownership to 49 percent ms luft said the 
revision was made to stimulate the investment necessary to revive 
east germanys flagging economy 
also today the adn news agency said communist party chief 
gregor gysi had been invited to washington next week for talks with 
president bush on eastern europe it did not say when the trip 
would occur and said it was private 
the communist party faces growing opposition among east germans 
in part because of its opposition to unification with west germany 
wolfgang berghofer the mayor of dresden quit the party this 
week in a speech to the dresden city council today the popular 
leader said of unification it is unavoidable that what belongs 
together will grow together 
the only question is in what time frame and in what manner it 
will occur he said 
there remain two separate rights of citizenship but this can 
no longer be compared to national identity berghofer said 
berghofers defection from the communists came on top of strikes 
and mass demonstrations against the party which has been accused 
of being too slow to adopt reforms 
a onehour strike in dresden on wednesday shut down 200 of the 
citys most important offices and services and police in leipzig 
rallied in support of prodemocracy activists 
a leading east german economist warned in a report published 
wednesday that the economy could collapse if the country doesnt 
swiftly convert to a free market system 
siegfried schiller a communist and deputy director of dresdens 
economic research institute said that such a collapse could come 
within a year without radical reforms 
the house is on fire and the government is wasting time 
posturing schiller told the newspaper die union every attempt 
to shore up a planned economy must be resisted 
he said he feared halfhearted reform attempts could cut off 
critical supplies of raw materials before east germany can afford 
to buy them from the west 
economics minister luft also proposed the speedy introduction of 
marketoriented economic reforms a west german tv network reported 
wednesday 
ms luft suggested allowing the east german mark to be freely 
exchanged for other currencies by 1992 dismantling price controls 
reducing state subsidies and introducing performanceoriented 
salaries and a new taxation system zdf television reported 
ms luft also wants to end the states monopoly on foreign trade 
some of the steps could start taking effect this year zdf 
reported 
however communist premier hans modrows government has resisted 
moving toward a freemarket economy calling instead for a third 
way between capitalism and communism 
but pressure for a conversion to capitalism has built up in 
recent weeks with west germanys powerful business community 
sensing vast new opportunities 
east germanys inefficient centrally planned economy has been 
hard hit by the exodus of some 340000 citizens to west germany 
last year many of them skilled young workers 
the migration tapered off after authorities opened borders to 
the west in november but up to 2000 east germans are still 
fleeing daily disillusioned about the prospects of reform despite 
free elections promised in may

a nato study said mikhail s 
gorbachevs economic reform program has had little impact in the 
soviet union and it cast doubt on the chances of it ever 
succeeding 
the study obtained by the associated press today said the 
failure of perestroika is evident in falling living standards 
of soviet citizens and it blamed soviet leaders for the situation 
the failure of the soviet leadership to press ahead with key 
measures such as price reforms and the halfhearted manner in 
which it has approached the growing fiscal and monetary crisis are 
reflected in the continuing decline of the soviet unions economic 
position said the study 
the survival prospects for economic reforms in the soviet 
union now admitted by the leadership to be in a state of crisis 
become increasingly doubtful said the study it was done by 
economic analysts of the 16nation north atlantic treaty 
organization 
the report compared economic reforms in china and the soviet 
union based on information up to july it was given to nato 
foreign ministers in december 
the analysts said no communist nation has succeeded in 
transforming a centrally planned economy to a flourishing 
freemarket system 
the key reason for failure has been the conflicting interests 
between the demands for economic reforms and the objectives of 
communist parties and the vested interests of their members it 
said 
party members want to safeguard the kind of economic 
structures mostly inefficient ones from which substantial 
benefits accrue to them it said 
whenever it came to do or die in past reform efforts the 
party bureaucrats have always put their own interest first as 
reflected once again by recent events in china it said 
the economic programs in the soviet union and china were 
hampered from the start by unsuitable political institutions 
it said 
the analysts predicted that the reform drive in china would lose 
further ground 
its scope has been seriously restricted and its direction 
rechanneled toward areas acceptable to the new more conservative 
and suspicious leadership in beijing it said 
future reform efforts would likely be limited to modernization 
measures that would increase efficiency somewhat but they would 
not solve the deeprooted real problems of the chinese economy 
and society according to the report 
it said the governments of poland and hungary offered the 
prospect of severing the ties between the communist party 
bureaucracy and its vested interest in obsolete economic structures 
the countries have been leaders in the moves toward democracy in 
eastern europe 
gorbachevs support for these efforts in hungary and poland 
may be indicative of his own vision of reform the study said 
without a political opposition it said gorbachev would have to 
loosen the communists grip on economic structures by going around 
the party apparatus in management decisions and giving state 
organizations more power 
it added by trying to maintain the countrys socialist 
achievements economic reforms in the soviet union will remain 
piecemeal 
but piecemeal reforms to a centrally planned economy generate 
unpredictable frictions that would not arise if other economic 
variables were free to adapt to remove their sting it said

officer troy patterson 27 was critically wounded and remained

needed 20 of the 37 entry fee to play in the united brooklyn

the officers wallet gun and shield were not taken detectives 
theorized instead that the shooting was linked to the officers 
arrests or his personal life

a hispanic police officer was free on bond and 
predicting his vindication after receiving a sevenyear prison term 
for the deaths of two blacks one critic called the sentence 
justice delayed and justice denied 
officer william lozano thanked his supporters after being 
sentenced wednesday by circuit judge joseph farina 
my attorney my family and i will continue to fight within the 
system for the truth for what is right and at the end we will 
win lozano said 
because of his felony conviction he faces the automatic loss of 
his job and his state certification for police duty the police 
department said 
the citys black neighborhoods which erupted in riots after the 
slayings a year ago remained calm overnight 
i think we can attribute this to the black community feeling 
justice was served police spokesman raymond lang said today 
lozano 31 was convicted last month on two counts of 
manslaughter for fatally shooteen longer 
i see this as both a case now of justice delayed and justice 
denied said marvin dunn a black psychology professor at florida 
international university seven years does not in fact mean seven 
years in prison 
but dunn who wrote a book on miamis 1980 race riots said he 
hoped blacks would accept the sentence with equanimity 
what we have to be concerned about is whether or not the 
perception of a miscarriage of justice now resurfaces in the black 
community dunn said urging a responsible reaction by all of 
us in the black community to accept and live with the judges 
decision 
defense attorneys criticized the case as an effort to ease 
racial tensions in miami rather than give their client a fair trial 
if officer lozano was black he never would have been charged 
with a crime defense attorney mark seiden told the judge if 
the two people on the motorcycle were white he never would have 
been charged with a crime 
prosecutor john hogan who recommended a 12year prison term 
described the sentence as a just one lozano could have faced a 
punishment of 12 to 17 years in prison under state sentencing 
guidelines 
miguel degrandy a vice president of the spanish american league 
against discrimination said the judge fashioned a sentence that 
he felt that both parties could live with 
however this is a nowin case for our community in dade 
county and there is still going to be unfortunately polarized 
reaction he said 
the shooting on jan 16 1989 sparked three days of racial 
violence the fourth riot in this city in the 1980s all were 
linked to the killing of blacks by police officers and in two of 
the cases acquittals of the white policemen sparked racial 
violence

liberian soldiers accused of killing 
hundreds of unarmed civilians are leaving few survivors in their 
wake as they scour the countryside looking for rebels medical 
workers and diplomats said today 
the reports based on harrowing accounts by refugees indicate 
that the mass killings are so thorough and indiscriminate that very 
few wounded are left behind 
they tell really horrendous stories of soldiers spraying 
entire villages with 50caliber machine guns said a western 
diplomat who requested anonymity bullets from such heavy weapons 
tear huge holes into bodies 
the diplomat and ivorian sources estimate at least 500 civilians 
have been killed in liberias eastern nimba county since soldiers 
were deployed to halt a dec 24 rebel incursion 
the refugees say there are not many wounded people because the 
soldiers slaughtered so many said the diplomat 
he visited refugees tuesday with ivorian government officials 
aid workers and other diplomats from nations giving food medicine 
and money to alleviate a food shortage 
an ongoing stream of refugees was estimated today to number more 
than 60000 between 12000 and 15000 other liberians have sought 
refuge in guinea the diplomat said 
at the ivorian border village of danane refugees dash 
desperately to hide in forests when they hear the staccato of 
machine gunfire that sounds daily from across the frontier in 
liberia 
they are traumatized by the combat and watching some of their 
relatives being killed said claude regnier a french adviser to 
the ivorian government who heads a committee coordinating refugee 
aid 
they are still in shock when the gunfire starts they rush to 
the forest and come out of the bush only when it stops he said 
in an interview 
a western diplomat said the killings began after rebels from the 
gio tribe stepped up attacks in an attempt to oust liberian 
president samuel doe who seized power in a bloody 1980 coup that 
ousted the descendants of freed american slaves who founded the 
west african nation in 1847 the gio long have felt oppressed by 
does krahn people 
it started with gio rebels attacking military outposts in 
their own ethnic heartland in nimba county the diplomat said on 
condition of anonymity the army came in and just went nuts 
because everyone looks like a rebel to them there has been some 
very heavyhanded slaughter 
the rebels retaliated about 10 days ago by moving south into 
traditional krahn territory and began slaughtering civilians there 
according to the diplomat that has caused a second wave of victims 
to flee east into ivory coast and north into guinea he said 
the killing continues the diplomat said despite a warning from 
doe on monday that soldiers who harm civilians will face firing 
squads 
liberian officials say does execution threat is helping to 
bring the situation under control 
initially justice minister jenkins scott said troops killed 
only armed civilians who attacked them 
one western diplomat conceded it might be difficult for troops 
to identify rebels who do not wear military uniforms 
regnier said 40 percent of refugees are women and children 30 
percent boys and youths and the remainder men 
doctors said refugees hospitalized in ivory coast include a 
5yearold girl shot in the leg 
at man hospital a regional health center 75 miles from danane 
director dr maurice kouame said his staff is treating only eight 
seriously wounded liberians

longdistance telephone services that charge 
the unwary 30 to 50 for information they could get for free head 
a list of telemarketing scams that an antifraud group predicted 
today will flower during the 1990s 
the costly abuse of 900 area code telephone service was just 
one of several increasingly popular consumer frauds compiled by the 
alliance against fraud in telemarketing 
our aim is to forewarn consumers so they can forearmed against 
fraud said linda golodner executive director of the national 
consumers league which coordinates the alliance 
while the alliance recognizes that many products and services 
are sold legitimately through telemarketing we want to warn 
consumers that con artists are making these types of offers through 
highpressure sales pitches providing little concrete 
information she said 
in another scam on the alliances list unsuspecting consumers 
get officiallooking envelopes that appear to be from a government 
agency but actually are peddling various fraudulent schemes 
currently such lookalike envelopes are not illegal tom 
mcclure of the us postal inspection service said at a news 
conference sponsored by the alliance a con artist is only 
limited by his imagination he said 
the alliance is a wideranging coalition of more than 60 
consumer groups trade associations state and federal agencies 
businesses news organizations and labor unions 
among the scams cited by the alliance were 
900 phone numbers that keep callers on hold racking up toll 
charges before giving generic information that could be obtained 
for free elsewhere about how to obtain or reestablish credit 
bogus healthcare promotions for phony arthritis and baldness 
remedies sexual aids and weightloss plans 
oneshot credit cards good only for purchasing goods from one 
specific department store or catalog although they are deceptively 
promoted as an allpurpose bank credit card such as mastercard or 
visa 
false claims by timeshare agents who charge up to 400 to 
resell a consumers unit promising to pay a worthless penalty as a 
guarantee if they dont sell the unit within a year 
its an epidemic theres about 10 billion in telemarketing 
fraud a year kansas securities commissioner doug mays said in a 
telephone interview wednesday 
mays said boiler rooms organized scam efforts promising 
ridiculously high profits through high pressure sales tactics and 
banks of telephones now are moving offshore 
mays calls such boiler rooms the crack houses of consumer 
fraud 
once based largely in florida and later colorado mays said 
boiler room scams for precious metals and highrisk penny stocks 
are now being phoned in to this country from costa rica the cayman 
islands panama and africa 
even as far inland as kansas were getting calls from liberia 
and south africa said may who next year will be president of 
the north american securities administrators association an 
organization of statelevel securities regulators 
in order not to become victims consumers must be able to tell 
the difference between fraudulent offers that come over the 
telephone and legitimate ones said ms golodner 
they can do that by asking questions getting answers in writing 
and contacting consumer protection agencies when they dont know 
anything about the salesperson or the product she said

parliament passed a law today that 
limits the powers of the secret police the new restrictions came 
in response to reports that security services routinely spied on 
legal opposition parties 
the legislation stipulates that covert intelligence gathering 
will be permitted only when the security of the nation the 
sovereignty of the country and its constitutional order are 
endangered by secret activities 
the vote was 279 for none against and 14 abstentions 
also two government officials interior minister state 
secretary zoltan gal and justice minister kalman kulcsar were 
given responsibility for intelligence operations 
introducing the bill entitled temporary regulation of the use 
of special secret service methods and means gal told parliament 
on wednesday that intelligence agencies had had little past 
supervision when hungary was a oneparty communist state 
the interim legislation was hurriedly introduced following a 
national uproar over revelations that the state security service 
was spying on scores of people including some members of 
parliament gal said a permanent and comprehensive bill governing 
the activities of the security services will be presented in 
parliament in february 
the scandal broke jan 5 when representatives of two opposition 
organizations presented reporters with secret documents leaked to 
them by a member of the secret police 
secret police targets of intelligence gathering included 
opposition parties and personalities writers and religious 
figures according to the documents 
chief public prosecutor karoly szijarto disclosed wednesday that 
the illegal eavesdropping was even more widespread than originally 
thought 
szijarto told the legislature the internal security department 
of the interior ministry even spied on the socialist party its 
predecessor the socialist workers party and other communist or 
leftist organizations the investigation is still under way 
while claiming to have had no knowledge of such practices 
interior minister istvan horvath resigned tuesday telling 
legislators that in a democracy that is the custom 
hungary formally became a multiparty state oct 23 and the 
first free elections since 1948 are scheduled for march 25 
although the socialist party asserts it was uninvolved the scandal 
is believed to have hurt its chances at the polls because it 
happened under its tenure 
the hungarian democratic forum the biggest opposition party 
already has signaled its opposition to the idea of a future 
coalition with the socialists in a clear indication of the partys 
desire to distance itself from what it considers a political 
liability 
the interim law also changed the name of the main intelligence 
agency from the state security service to national security service 
gal said the move was meant as a signal that the secret 
service organs no longer serve the state organizatio but have as 
their primary aim the security of the entire nation and 
constitutional order 
premier miklos nemeth subsequently appointed gal as interim head 
of the interior ministry while parliament agreed to name kulcsar 
director of the national security service

moscow ap a baltic nationalist group said today that an 
armenian organization has accepted an invitation to attend peace 
talks aimed at ending ethnic conflict with the neighboring republic 
of azerbaijan 
there was no word on whether an azerbaijani delegation would 
attend the talks planned monday in the latvian capital riga 
the attempt to arrange negotiations was the latest effort to end 
two weeks of violence that began with antiarmenian riots in 
azerbaijan and has grown into a drive for secession by some 
azerbaijanis 
communist leaders in azerbaijan today blamed their former leader 
for the crisis and expelled him from the party more soviet troops 
were reported killed in attacks by militants in azerbaijans 
capital baku 
at least 171 people have been killed since the unrest began jan 
13 
in a telephone interview today from riga anda anspoka of the 
latvian peoples front said the group received a letter of 
confirmation from the armenian peoples front to attend a peace 
conference monday 
the armenian group authorized its representatives to sign any 
documents to end the ethnic strife ms anspoka said 
a spokesman for the nationalist azerbaijani peoples front usus 
samed ogli said today his group had not decided if it will attend 
ogli said the azerbaijani front leaders had gone underground out 
of fear they would be arrested and planned to meet in secret friday 
to decide whether to attend the talks 
ms anspoka said the talks would be mediated by leaders of 
peoples front groups in the baltic republics of latvia lithuania 
and estonia like the groups in azerbaijan and armenia the 
peoples front groups support autonomy for their republics 
their causes would not be helped by nationalist unrest requiring 
kremlin military intervention which explains in part the baltics 
eagerness to settle the dispute successful mediation also would 
give prestige to the baltic peoples front groups 
in addition the baltics are not interested in seeing their 
young men drafted into military service to control the conflict 
azerbaijans central committee convened at 11 pm wednesday and 
ousted abdulrakham vezirov who was named party leader during 
azerbaijaniarmenian unrest in may 1988 he was given a mandate to 
restore order after a longrunning dispute between azerbaijanis and 
armenians erupted 
the conflict involves the region of nagornokarabakh which is 
under the control of azerbaijan a mainly shiite moslem republic 
but populated by armenians who are mostly christians armenia 
wants to annex the region 
vezirov a former diplomat and career party official was 
expelled from the party for serious mistakes that led to the 
current crisis said baku journalist tunzala kasumova vezirov had 
been removed as party chief earlier in the week 
vezirov was replaced by ayaz mutalibov the republics prime 
minister 
meanwhile tass said militant nationalists were continuing 
attacks on soviet troops who entered baku on saturday it said two 
soldiers were killed wednesday and one seriously wounded 
strikes continued in the city in defiance of a military ban and 
public transport was at a standstill tass said 
azerbaijanis have pledged not to end their strikes until soviet 
troops withdraw 
the harbor at baku a caspian sea port of 18 million was 
reported calm today following reports of a harbor fight wednesday 
between military troops and azerbaijanis blocking the waterway 
the military commander of baku lt gen vladimir dubinyak said 
in a radio announcment today that occasional gunfire rang out 
during the night at the port but that no one was killed 
he said authorities detained more than 100 people during the 
night 68 for curfew violations 
leila yunusova an azerbaijani activist said 100000 of 
azerbaijans 380000 communists have torn up their party cards 
signaling growing resentment of central authorities in moscow for 
ordering the crackdown 
on wednesday soldiers rounded up 43 activists and banned 
rallies in baku 
tass today cited baku radio as saying troops had detained mamed 
alizade chairman of the defense committee of the azerbaijani 
peoples front 
it said he possessed various weapons symbols of the popular 
front medicines radio equipment and propaganda materials calling 
on the population to resist authorities 
the communist party daily pravda said 400 dependents of ethnic 
russian servicemen were flown out of azerbaijan on wednesday night 
because of fears that azerbaijanis angry over the troop deployment 
would turn on them 
about 100000 ethnic russians live in baku 
pravda said the refugees were being taken to military facilities 
and public buildings in moscow and kiev and that others are being 
housed by the black sea fleets 
on wednesday tass reported the soviet military evacuated more 
than 16000 wives and children of soldiers from the region because 
of increasing threats against soviet troops 
antiarmenians riots in baku on jan 13 escalated into armed 
clashes between groups of azerbaijanis and armenians thousands of 
armenians fled as nationalist extremists gained strength in 
azerbaijan and militant azerbaijanis began fighting soviet troops 
who were deployed to restore order

the government has recalled a film 
from its embassies to cut out a sequence showing queen margrethe ii 
in 1980 greeting nicolae ceausescu whom she later awarded 
denmarks highest honor officials said thursday 
a living queen a 28minute film about the royal family was 
distributed to foreign missions as archive material for tv stations 
foreign ministry spokesman jacob benthien said the 90second 
sequence ordered expunged showed the queen welcoming ceausescu 
during a state visit 
its obvious that no one wants publicity for a monarchy with 
such an awarding ceremony benthien said no one was happy with 
that clip 
ceausescu who was overthrown and executed last month was given 
denmarks knight of the order of the elephant 
after ceausescu was deposed the royal palace announced that his 
name was being stricken from the list of knights the queen also 
canceled the order of the knight of the great cross which she gave 
to ceausescus wife elena 
ceausescu romanias hardline leader for 24 years was looked 
upon favorably by western nations for many years because he steered 
his communist country on a path independent of moscow he received 
honors from other western nations including britain but they were 
stripped from him when he was toppled 
another scene from the danish film that was cut showed the queen 
smoking a cigarette while listening to a speech by prince consort 
henrik during a 1979 visit to china 
the entire film will be replaced after the festivities marking 
the queens 50th birthday on april 16 benthien said

pope john paul ii praised the 
christian heritage of this african nation today as he began an 
eightday tour of the impoverished sahel region his sixth 
pilgrimage to africa 
the pope flew from rome in a special alitalia airbus to amilcar 
cabral international airport on the 10island archipelago off 
africas northwest coast after two days in the former portuguese 
colony he heads to guinea bissau mali burkina faso and chad 
in brief remarks in portuguese the pope referred to the 
predominantly roman catholic islands as a country of ancient 
christianity at the gates of continental africa and wished 
grace salvation and peace on cape verdians and the many who 
emigrated abroad 
after greetings from several thousand wellwishers the pope 
transferred to a smaller plane for a 40minute flight to praia for 
the official welcoming ceremony 
islanders were out all day sweeping the sand and dust from the 
streets blown by strong winds gusting across the archipelago 
the trip is the 45th foreign voyage of the popes 11year 
pontificate 
the countries in the subsaharan semiarid region stretching 
across western and central africa are among the worlds poorest 
with millions of people living on the edge of starvation 
the pope is expected to renew an appeal he made 10 years ago for 
international aid to help save subsaharan africa from its chronic 
problems of poverty hunger disease and encroaching deserts 
this is the poorest part of africa and the pope will discuss 
the realities of these countries said vatican spokesman joaquin 
navarro 
the visit comes at a time when african government and church 
leaders are concerned that western aid and development funds will 
be redirected from africa to the new democrtic movements in eastern 
europe 
the interest of the western world is focused on the east and 
there is a risk of forgetting to save one part of humanity that 
would fall back into misery cardinal paul zoungrana of burkina 
faso said in an interview with the italian catholic magazine 30 
giorni 30 days 
this is not the moment to abandon africa he said the 
pope can use his moral strength and attract the attention of the 
whole world 
noting that the polishborn pope himself comes from eastern 
europe the cardinal said if a new problem arises you cant 
forget the old ones and if its a pope from the east who reminds 
us the world will take note 
in a special supplement on the papal trip the vatican newspaper 
losservatore romano decried the worlds indifference towards 
africas problems 
while the eyes of the world are still fixed on the 
extraordinary events of eastern europe the heart of the church now 
looks elsewhere to the vast territory of suffering that is 
africa the newspaper said 
a centerpiece of the popes trip will be a ceremony monday in 
ouagadougou capital of burkina faso marking the 10th anniversary 
of john pauls appeal for the sahel in which he declared i can 
not remain silent while my brothers and sisters are in danger 
the appeal led to the creation in 1984 of the john paul ii 
foundation for the sahel funded primarily by contributions from 
catholics in west germany and sponsoring agricultural and 
development projects in the region 
john paul who is scheduled to make another trip to africa later 
this year is particularly interested in africa because of the 
rapid growth of catholicism on the continent the african church 
counts more than 75 million followers today or about 13 percent of 
the total population compared to 1 percent at the turn of the 
century 
about 90 percent of cape verdes population of 360000 is roman 
catholic the highest percentage in africa however catholics are 
a small minority in the other countries on the tour ranging from 
less than 1 percent in mali to 9 percent in burkina faso 
while cape verde is the most prosperous of the five nations 
more than 400000 islanders greater than the current population 
have emigrated in recent decades to the united states and europe in 
search of jobs and a better life

a federal judge has ruled that a drug courier 
profile used to justify searching cars during traffic stops 
violates the rights of blacks and hispanics 
the country cant pay lip service to the rights of blacks by 
honoring martin luther king jrs birthday and then trample on 
their rights through law enforcement us district judge jim r 
carrigan said wednesday 
the traffic stops in eagle county west of denver violate the 
rights of blacks to travel freely and to be protected against 
unreasonable searches he said 
sheriff aj johnson testified that race is one of the criteria 
used to target suspected drug couriers other factors include 
having fastfood wrappers on the car floor having no luggage 
motorists who have driven long distances nonstop and cars with 
outofstate license plates 
the ruling means federal drug charges against reputed los 
angeles crips gang member louis laymon probably will be dismissed 
so far the only casualty in the war against drugs has been the 
constitution said laymons attorney david lane its nice to 
see a judge like carrigan firing a shot in its defense 
laymon was arrested after sheriffs sgt james perry found crack 
cocaine in his car during a traffic stop on interstate 70 about 100 
miles west of denver 
lane argued that the car was stopped only because laymon is 
black and his car had california plates 
laymon acknowledged during a hearing to suppress evidence that 
he has been a crack cocaine dealer but he denied the cocaine found 
in the car was his 
perry contended he stopped the car for weaving on the highway 
and obtained laymons permission for the search 
but carrigan said perry used trivial traffic violations as 
an excuse to stop cars for drug searches

president vaclav havel of czechoslovakia 
called today for a unified europe that incorporates soviet bloc 
countries that are adopting democratic reforms and marketoriented 
economies 
havel presenting his vision of a unified europe to polands 
national assembly said a joint effort to return to europe 
would avoid rivalries among emerging democracies seeking admission 
to the political and economic alliances of western europe 
we should not compete in who is going to overtake whom and who 
will first win a seat in some european body but we should do just 
the opposite help each other said the playwright and longtime 
dissident who became czechoslovakias president after a peaceful 
prodemocracy movement in november 
havel was greeted today at warsaws military airport by 
communist president wojciech jaruzelski senior government 
officials a full military honor guard and the diplomatic corps 
havel appeared uncomfortable and unaccustomed to the ceremonial 
greeting 
he seemed startled when the precision honor guard shouted in 
unison at him hail to mr president 
to lawmakers havel said western europe is much more advanced 
in integration processes and if we were to return to europe 
individually it would certainly take much longer and it would be 
much more complicated than if we act together 
this does not only concern economics it concerns everything 
including disarmament talks he said 
havel said a power vacuum has existed in central europe since 
the end of world war i and that countries of the region until 
recently colonized by the soviets should unite into a new 
formation 
havel said it is hard to forecast the institutional shape that 
our east european or central european cooperation will create 
he proposed that representatives of poland and hungary come to 
czechoslovakia to discuss the form of such cooperation observers 
from other eastern european countries could also attend the talks 
he said 
havel takes his proposal to hungary on friday 
havel was warmly received in the parliament chamber 
the audience chuckled when he recalled a secret meeting with 
czechoslovak and polish dissidents along the mountainous 
polishczechoslovak border in 1978 
havel recalled how he and the three polish dissidents who now 
are lawmakers laughed back then about being able to duck 
authorities to hold the meeting 
if someone had told us then that in 12 years we would be 
deputies ministers and presidents then we would have laughed even 
more havel said 
earlier havel had private talks with jaruzelski the only 
communist leader not ousted during the wave of revolution that 
swept the soviet unions six east european allies in 1989 
with solidaritys tacit assistance jaruzelski was elected 
president to oversee a stable transition to a fully democratic 
poland 
polish prime minister tadeusz mazowiecki visited prague on 
monday in an effort to strengthen polishczechoslovak ties 
polish politicians have argued that the two countries situated 
between a powerful soviet union and a potentially powerful and 
reunited germany should cooperate to avoid domination by their 
neighbors 
during the 1980s the solidarity opposition that now leads 
polands government forged close relations with czechoslovakias 
dissident movement now in power in prague 
but government relations are strained by controversies over 
environmental issues and restrictions on poles at czechoslovak 
border crossings 
in addition there is a popular tradition of rivalry between 
poles and czechs neighboring slavic peoples

the associated press announced thursday that it 
is switching to electronic darkrooms as its basic photo receivers 
accelerating the conversion of the nations newspapers to 
photostream aps pictureaminute digital photo delivery highway 
in the third quarter of this year ap will begin replacing 
laserphoto receivers at 950 newspapers that receive ap photos with 
the ap leaf picture desk a microprocessorbased electronic 
darkroom developed by ap and leaf systems of natick mass said 
louis d boccardi ap president and general manager 
this is a major step into the electronic future for us and 
for our newspaper members boccardi said this revolutionizes 
picture handling the darkroom enormously improves photo 
reproduction quality and opens the door to production efficiencies 
and ultimately pagination of pictures in the nations newspapers 
he said that installation of the darkrooms would be done by 
region and would take two years from the start of the project 
ap announced plans for photostream in 1987 and has tested 
aspects of the highspeed digital collection and delivery system at 
newspapers during the past year a prototype transmitted photos 
from the world series and the malta summit and will be used at the 
super bowl 
the photostream delivery network incorporates a highcapacity 
satellite circuit and digital technology 
aps present laserphoto delivery system transmits black and 
white photos in nine minutes and color in 30 minutes photostream 
transmits black and white in less than one minute and color in less 
than three 
aps original photostream plans called for replacement of the 
current nineminute ap laserphoto receiver with a twominute 
receiver newspapers who wished to buy darkrooms could have done so 
as the ap experimented further with electronic darkrooms it 
became clear that we should opt for the technology of the future 
not an updated version of the technology of the past boccardi 
said 
john reid ap vice president and director of communications and 
technology said that photostream subscribers will have the option 
of receiving an expanded photo report or the same report they 
receive today the photostream report also will provide more color 
and a greater selection of photos 
if a paper chooses it can buy the ap vax picture desk a system 
that incorporates digital equipment corporations vax computer 
technology 
both the ap leaf picture desk and the ap vax picture desk 
include a disk storage device with the capacity for hundreds of 
images and a terminal with monitor and keyboard the electronic 
darkrooms will work with virtually all conventional scanning and 
screening devices and will have the capability with additional 
hardware of receiving the newspapers local pictures 
each system is fast and easy to use can handle analog and 
digital reception and can operate as a single workstation or be 
expanded with newspaperpurchased options to a network of 
editing stations storage and ports are also easily expandable with 
newspaperpurchased options both systems have output capability 
for both receivers and pagination systems reid said 
if a newspaper does not want an electronic darkroom ap will 
install its new twominute laserphoto receiver the newspaper also 
will have the option of purchasing a darkroom other than the ap 
leaf or ap vax picture desks 
we have a flexible system here said hal buell ap assistant 
general manager for newsphotos it will fit the kind of picture 
handling arrangement that individual newspapers want 
aps decision to use the electronic darkroom as its basic 
photo receiver opens the door to the world of electronic picture 
handling for our members buell said 
the relationship between ap and leaf systems began in 1988 when 
ap helped develop and became the exclusive distributor of the ap 
leafax 35 a portable negative transmitter 
the two companies decided recently to collaborate on the ap leaf 
picture desk the two companies also recently agreed to provide the 
ap leafspooler which allows a photographer to store and transmit 
pictures that have been processed in the ap leafax 35

people out coggins said everyone apparently was accounted for

the boy was screaming and his head was bloody said wells 
who was hospitalized for a back injury i picked it up but i 
dont know how i had to do it somebody had to help 
john lee administrator for crenshaw county hospital said wells 
was instrumental in pulling several of the people out after he 
pulled them out he collapsed 
wells said he had planned to return to his hometown of racine 
wis this week after working in alabama for several months he 
said he was walking between two trailers when a tornado hit 
i saw it coming and the trailers just started rolling like 
toys he said searching for the trapped victims he said all 
i could do was tell the to scream so i could find them it was so

more than 19 million older americans wish 
they were back in the work force and they arent just interested 
in cushy jobs where they can pick their hours and name their 
pay a private group reported thursday 
the commonwealth fund a philanthropic foundation said a 
national survey of americans ages 5064 found there is an available 
labor pool of older people that is far larger more qualified more 
flexible and more committed than previously believed 
this untapped older labor force could be one very important 
answer to the future labor shortage said thomas w moloney 
senior vice president of the foundation what we see here are 
capable educated experienced people who want to get back in 
moloney said the report should help dispel the conventional 
wisdom among employers that most older americans want only cushy 
jobs and that there are few qualified workers in the group who 
have realistic job expectations 
the findings are based on a 1989 national survey by louis harris 
and associates inc of 1751 men aged 5564 and 1758 women aged 
5059 the different age groups for men and women were selected to 
catch them at the times when people traditionally drop out of the 
work force 
the results were analyzed for the commonwealth fund by icf inc 
a washington consulting firm which concluded that 19 million 
older americans about 24 percent of nonworkers in the surveyed 
age groups say they are able and willing to go back to work 
icf identified 11 million of these people as highly committed 
to rejoining the labor force these people said they need a job for 
financial reasons are physically able to do key tasks such as 
driving or using a calculator are seeking work and have reasonable 
wage expectations are willing to work under difficult conditions 
and are willing to take jobs that are in demand such as sales word 
processing clerical positions day care and managerial posts 
these retirees had education job skills and experience largely 
comparable to those of their counterparts still in the work force 
the poll found 
seventyfive percent were high school or college graduates 
compared to 85 percent of those still working sixtyfour percent 
had five or more years of experience on their last job compared to 
77 percent of current older workers 
on the subject of work conditions 83 percent were willing to 
take seasonal jobs 60 percent would work standing up 73 percent 
would work alone 60 percent would commute more than 30 minutes and 
54 percent would work evenings and weekends 
moloney said the polling data has not yet been fully analyzed to 
determine why these people left the work force before age 65 but 
preliminary results indicate many were forced out of their jobs

on halloween night 1988 a man with a broken 
nose strolled into a greek restaurant and ordered a glass of red 
wine and a fish dinner i just killed a couple of guys he 
remarked between bites the police are coming to get me soon 
andreas doczy 51 was not kidding 
in a saloon up the street seamus and padraig folan brothers 
who came to america searching for opportunity had instead found 
sudden irrational violent death 
there was an argument over the old country doczy told the 
police 
testimony at his murder trial which is in its second week 
helps explain how the folans died but not why 
the folans seamus 38 and padraig 27 came to new york 
looking for work their native connemara a rocky stretch of 
western ireland has exported its young men and women for more than 
150 years 
the folans were two of 11 children 10 of whom came to the 
united states in the last decade as the irish economy sagged they 
found jobs as construction workers and moved into apartments in 
queens and the bronx 
andreas doczy was from hungary he was one of the few members of 
his family to survive as the eastern front moved rapidly west at 
the end of world war ii and he fled during the anticommunist 
uprising in 1956 that was crushed by soviet tanks 
he later joined the us air force and served for five years 
then started his own business his lawyer describes him as very 
much a cold war guy 
all of which may or may not help explain what happened that 
halloween night at mcgraths bar in astoria a working class 
section of queens 
james gasiorowski a former policeman was tending bar there 
were about 10 regulars around including doczy and the folans who 
were drinking with a man named tommy hughes 
the bartender testified last week that the folans and hughes 
were sitting at the end of the bar when doczy walked over 
all of a sudden they started arguing with each other the 
folan brothers told andy to leave them alone i went over and 
told them to stop arguing 
doczy went to his seat but soon he was back and the argument 
renewed 
the topics apparently included soccer and the relative merits of 
hungary and ireland there was a lot of cursing and gasiorowski 
heard doczy yell something about drunken irish 
the brothers responded in kind witnesses say the word 
communist was being thrown around pretty liberally said 
richard piperno a spokesman for the queens district attorney 
ireland landed the first blow when padraig folan punched the 
smaller doczy in the nose knocking him down then seamus kicked 
him twice in the ribs the bartender broke up the fight 
i asked andy if he was ok gasiorowski testified he said 
he was ok and went over to his drink and he said im going to 
blow those guys away 
doczy walked out went home and came back about a halfhour 
later hughes had left but the folans were still drinking doczy 
went over to them there was more arguing and doczy pulled out a 
32caliber revolver and shot seamus in the back of the head then 
he turned and shot padraig 
before he walked out doczy remarked i know i know im going 
to jail 
doczys lawyer last week told jurors that his client did not 
know he had done wrong you will acquit the defendant by reason 
of mental disease or defect 
to the folans sister ann the insanity defense offered little 
consolation 
what happened has changed my attitude about this country 
she told the daily news last week its very hard to get the 
anger out of you you keep looking for answers where there are no 
answers

two tugboats moving 33 barges collided in the 
dark on the mississippi today spilling more than 160000 gallons 
of gasoline and diesel fuel near intakes for public water systems 
authorities said 
coast guard spokesman lt ken keane said the fuel spilled from 
two barges which were still leaking shortly before noon 
the orleans and jefferson parish water systems said they were 
checking water quality at the intakes 
were not having any problem with drinking water on either 
side right now said david mancuso of the jefferson water system 
the tugs a 25barge vessel carrying coal and an eightbarge 
one moving fuel were going in opposite directions when the 
collision occurred near the huey p long bridge outside new 
orleans keane said 
it was not immediately clear how the accident occurred he said 
we just have two that have holes in them he said theres 
no doubt there were others damaged 
the owner of the leaking barges estimated that 84000 gallons of 
fuel spilled from each vessel 
the coast guard instructed barge crews to use their booms to 
contain the diesel and to leave the gasoline alone because 
containing gasoline into a pocket creates a fire hazard keane 
said he noted gasoline evaporates quickly 
keane said that diesel is poisonous to fish and other wildlife 
but that any fuel not contained would be diluted quickly in the 
mississippis swift current 
the leaking barges were owned by chotin transportation of 
cincinnati chotin vice president stephen frasher said the company 
was investigating the spill

the postal service is shrinking the areas in 
which it promises overnight and secondday mail delivery aiming to 
provide what it hopes will be more consistent service 
postmaster general anthony frank says what customers want most 
is dependability just tell me how many days ahead i have to mail 
my mothers birthday card 
by concentrating its resources on smaller areas the agency 
hopes to better keep its delivery promises explained frank 
and to keep them honest the agency is hiring an outside firm to 
measure its performance and report the results publicly 
the effort to make service more consistent comes just two months 
before the postal service is expected to apply for a rate increase 
to take effect in 1991 
the more concentrated service was tested on new york city over 
the past year with only one complaint frank added similar plans 
will be instituted across the nation between june and the end of 
the year he said 
weve already done 29000 interviews with the public said 
frank of the research that led to planned changes in delivery 
the biggest complaint inconsistent service 
sometimes a letter mailed across town would arrive overnight 
sometimes the second day sometimes it took a week 
people said they want consistent delivery frank explained they 
know when their check or magazine or other regular mail is sent 
and they want to be confident of when it will arrive 
just tell me how many days ahead i have to mail my mothers 
birthday card just tell me i want to be sure its there 
frank quoted as a typical complaint 
second he said was that people want their mail delivered at 
the same time every day 
i wouldnt have guessed that that would be no 2 he added 
they dont want to go out there and see it empty 
and the third thing they say is they want local mail delivered 
overnight he said 
in general the changes mean that areas where the postal service 
promises overnight delivery will shrink somewhat 
twothirds of all mail is local and will not be affected by the 
changes frank said in general he said between 5 percent and 8 
percent of mail might be changed from overnight to second day or 
from second day to third day delivery 
currently the postal service manages to deliver about 95 percent 
of its overnight mail on time but doesnt even come close to 
95 percent for mail it tries to deliver on the second or third day 
frank said 
following the new york city tests frank said local and regional 
postal officials are developing plans for new delivery areas they 
will seek comment and suggestions from postal customers and the 
changes are expected to take place starting in the summer 
nevertheless some critics have complained that mail delivery 
will be slowed by the changes with consumer advocate ralph nader 
charging that mail standards are deteriorating 
from franks point of view the standards were simply out of 
date and in need of reconsideration 
the areas designated to receive overnight and second day 
delivery were set in 1971 frank explained things have changed 
since then roads are more crowded space is tighter on airlines 
and population patterns have shifted 
when postal officials began asking customers how large an area 
they thought should have overnight delivery it always turned out 
to be less than what the agency was trying to provide he added 
in some areas the agency has been stretching itself to serve a 
relatively few customers 
for example every day the postal service averages 200 letters 
between gainesville fla and albany ga 
theyre 190 miles apart we give them overnight service 
said frank trying to maintain service like that strains resources 
on the other hand frank said some overnight delivery areas 
should be expanded for example nashua nh is now designated 
for second day delivery from boston and frank thinks it should be 
overnight 
in general frank said he expects to keep overnight delivery 
for cities with second day delivery aimed at the area within a 
state and to adjacent states and third day for the balance of the 
nation

an international meeting has ended in disarray 
and the fate of thousands of vietnamese refugees hangs on a dispute 
between the united states and britain over whether they should be 
sent home against their will 
the 30nation conference on refugees adjourned wednesday after 
us officials insisted no vietnamese be forced to return home 
before jan 1 1991 that blocked consensus on a proposed starting 
date of july 1 
after only 10 days in office the un high commissioner for 
refugees has been thrust into the argument 
thorvald stoltenberg a former norwegian foreign minister has 
the task of negotiating with both on a starting date for mandatory 
repatriation of vietnamese who do not qualify for refugee status in 
hong kong a british crown colony 
the un refugee office had proposed the sixmonth suspension of 
repatriations as a compromise between us demands and britains 
argument that only immediate deportations would deter another mass 
influx of boat people to the overcrowded colony 
britain returned 51 vietnamese to their communist homeland in 
december under an agreement reached with vietnam last year 
there is no objective justification for a delay in mandatory 
repatriation but in the interests of consensus we were prepared to 
agree on a moratorium said robin mclaren head of the british 
delegation 
although the twoday meeting ended without agreement it marked 
the first international consensus that vietnamese deemed to have 
fled for economic rather than political reasons should be returned 
even against their will 
we do have agreement on mandatory repatriation mclaren told 
reporters what we dont have is a date 
the united states relaxed its opposition to forced repatriations 
and told the meeting it would not block international consensus on 
forcible return of economic refugees according to sources present 
at closed session 
for the first time at an international gathering vietnam also 
agreed to take back thousands of the emigrants as part of a 
unsupported program it said none should arrive before oct 1 
however to allow time for preparations to absorb them into a 
struggling economy 
the un refugee agency which has opposed forcible 
repatriations said it would help monitor those deported to vietnam 
if agreement was reached in geneva 
mclaren the british delegate was clearly annoyed by the us 
refusal to compromise despite support for the sixmonth moratorium 
by all the other nations except vietnam 
he said the bush administration should rethink its policy on 
timing and said he expected stoltenberg to take soundings of of 
the us view by the end of next wek 
an apparent contradiction in us policy complicates the matter 
although us delegates softened the stance washingtons 
officially opposes forcible return 
i want to emphasize that the united states position on 
involuntary repatriation has not changed state department 
spokeswoman margaret tutwiler said in washington the united 
states remains opposed in principle and in practice to 
involuntary repatriation 
mclaren said lack of an international agreement would not deter 
britain from returning boat people under last years agreement with 
vietnam 
geoffrey barnes security chief of hong kong told the delegates 
hong kong could not cope with another influx of 35000 people the 
number that arrived in 1989 and spoke of growing pressure to push 
refugee boats back out to sea 
about 109000 boat people are in camps in hong kong malaysia 
thailand indonesia and the philippines according to un figures 
slightly more than half or 56000 are in hong kong the 12000 
who arrived before june 1988 were granted refugee status 
automatically but the others are being to determine whether they 
are politial refugees 
the un agency has said about 7000 people have been screened 
in hong kong and 85 percent of these were classified as economic 
migrants 
about 1100 people have returned to vietnam voluntarily since 
march 1989 and 1400 more are registered to do so each person who 
returns voluntarily receives the equivalent of 50 from the un 
agency and qualifies for a years food aid from the vietnamese 
government 
in pressing for postponement of mandatory repatriation until 
next year the united states argued that the voluntary program 
needed more time to work

a junk dealer under suspicion in two 
mail bomb slayings hired a lawyer today and stopped cooperating 
with authorities fbi divers meanwhile began dredging a pond near 
his home 
robert wayne oferrell who promised cooperation with the fbi 
while it searched his home and business this week hired lawyer 
paul harden of evergreen who today signaled an end to the 
opendoor policy 
im afraid hes been very cooperative and it concerns me 
said harden who described himself as a longtime friend of the 
oferrell family 
oferrell 46 has been questioned in the december bombing 
deaths of a federal appeals judge near birmingham and a civil 
rights lawyer in georgia 
harden spoke with reporters after divers began dredging a pond 
about 15 acres in size across a road from oferrells home it was 
not known what investigators were seeking although in recent days 
their search focused on a typewriter 
federal agents spent much of the week going through oferrells 
home and business before loading boxes from the business into a 
truck wednesday they pumped out the warehouse septic tank and 
emptied the septic tank beside his home 
they also took hair samples from some of oferrells relatives 
federal sources speaking on condition of anonymity have 
confirmed oferrell is a suspect in the slayings of 11th us 
circuit judge robert vance and robert robinson a black laywer from 
savannah ga 
the fbi previously said they believed one or more white 
supremacists were responsible for mailing bombs to the victims 
federal sources have said polygraph tests administered this week 
on oferrell indicated he was being untruthful in some instances 
but oferrell said i have not been told i am a suspect and i 
have not been told i failed a lie detector 
polygraph results are not always reliable and are inadmissable 
in criminal trials 
authorities have said they were looking for a typewriter 
oferrell used to write a letter to the 11th circuit in 1988 the 
typewriting in that letter matched that in letters claiming 
responsibility for the bombings sources said 
oferrell wrote to the court concerning a lawsuit against his 
former employer gulf life insurance co and said the us court 
system is corrupt but none of his court documents mention 
racial topics 
last year a panel on which vance served ruled against oferrell 
in that case 
oferrell said there were about a halfdozen typewriters at his 
warehouse but he denied that authorities had found anything 
linking him to the case he said he hoped the fbi would leave him 
alone

who has been involved in civil rights and antidrug causes 
he said he has been a friend of barrys for 20 years and that 
barry has been an alcoholic at least that long

a pusher gregory said i would feel the same way if it was the 
head of the ku klux klan who had been arrested 
gregory said he and barry were together in miami six weeks ago 
and he told barry man theyre going to get you 
barry was arrested on a charge of cocaine possession last week

the bang is gradually going out of chinese new 
year as authorities in beijing cut the capitals firecracker supply 
for the third straight year and similar measures are being adopted 
in other cities 
traditionally the chinese greet the lunar new year which this 
year falls on saturday with a long deafening roar of 
firecrackers which are supposed to drive off evil spirits 
but this year roadside stalls doing a brisk business in 
firecracker sales are conspicuously absent from the capital the 
official peoples daily this week reported a 23 percent decrease in 
beijings firecracker supply from last year although more than 1 
billion fireworks are expected to be sold 
shanghai chinas largest city adopted firecracker regulations 
last year that include a twofifths reduction in this years 
firecracker sales 
ma zhengjia director of the beijing public security bureaus 
foreign affairs office said thursday that regulations on the sale 
transport and shooting off of firecrackers were enacted in 1986 to 
try to reduce the number of deaths injuries and fires caused by 
firecrackers each lunar new year or spring festival as the 
holiday is called in mainland china 
in 1987 251 people in beijing were killed or injured by 
firecrackers but the following year the figure was down to 26 he 
said adding that the number of fires went down from 224 in 1987 to 
22 last year 
but authorities this year may be more concerned about 
controlling the holiday celebrations after hundreds of thousands of 
disenchanted chinese took to the streets last spring calling for 
democracy and other changes martial law imposed in may was lifted 
only two weeks ago 
as before bans have been placed on setting off firecrackers at 
tiananmen square site of last springs prodemocracy protests and 
other public places that draw crowds including the railway station 
and airport but the number of restricted areas 610 is nearly 
double what it was two years ago 
ma insisted there was no connection between the regulations 
which he said were longstanding and last years prodemocracy 
movement which was crushed by troops who entered the city killing 
hundreds and perhaps thousands of people 
it has nothing to do with june 3 he said referring to the 
night the army marched into beijing 
as you can see for yourself our society is very stable right 
now the masses are happily preparing for the holiday the markets 
are abundently stocked with whatever you want to buy ma said 
store shelves in beijing still were wellstocked thursday two 
days before the new year 
one little boy just tall enough to see over the counter stood 
with his nose pressed to the glass case trying to decide whether to 
get pretty fireworks like the flash of lightning or two kicks 
of the feet or the traditional strings of red firecrackers that 
his father impatiently told him to choose 
the cheapest were 3footlong sparklers that went for about 3 
cents there were 2 bags of colorful animals and other toys that 
run in circles while spraying colorful sparks when lighted the 
most expensive were strings of 1000 firecrackers that cost about 
230 to 320 
buyers unhesitatingly paid between 4 and 6 and some said they 
planned to buy more 
im buying these for my two daughters said a man in his 30s 
after asking the clerk to show him fireworks appropriate for 
little girls

despite easing tensions in europe a cold war 
still exists in asia where the united states and the soviet union 
have focused on competing military forces a japanese scholar told 
congress thursday 
we see two products of the cold war firmly intact a divided 
korea and a divided china said masashi nishihara a professor of 
international relations at the national defense academy of japan 
there is little dialogue between the two superpowers about how 
they can resolve their confrontational force structures he said 
nishihara was one of several scholars from overseas testifying 
before the senate armed services committee the panel is holding a 
series of hearings of us defense needs in light of the changing 
soviet threat 
overall nishihara said the soviet military poses less of a 
threat to japan that in the past even though moscow continues to 
deploy modern ships aircraft and other weapons in the pacific 
region 
but he said there remain uncertainties in the region that could 
cause problems for japanese and us security including the 
possible development of nuclear weapons by north korea and the 
steady buildup of the chinese navy 
north korea does not manufacture nuclear weapons yet although it 
has built a nuclear reactor that produced plutonium a material 
needed for a nation to have a nuclear capability according to gary 
milhollin of the wisconsin project on nuclear arms control a group 
that monitors the development of nuclear weapons worldwide 
if they get real close to making weapons the south koreans 
are going to have to react he said 
nishihara also said japan should be consulted about any us 
moves to reduce its defenses in the pacific 
while japan must strengthen its selfdefense forces he said he 
doubted whether the united states the japanese public or other 
asian countries would support a muchexpanded defense role for 
japanese forces he said 
the japanese constitution adopted during the postwar us 
occupation curbed military spending

domestic news agency the actress died of pneumonia at her home in 
kensington west london

guide to what it called the worst of environmentally damaging 
packaging listing tollfree telephone numbers of the products 
makers and urging calls of complaint 
consumers need to send these companies a clear message that 
they dont want and dont need these socalled convenience items 
and overpackaged products steven a romalewski author of the 
guide said in an interview 
some of the guides examples are familiar targets of 
environmentalist criticism including disposable diapers 
disposable razors plastic utensils polystyrene foam packages and 
socalled degradable plastic bags 
it also faults specialized convenience products such as eastman 
kodak cos fling disposable camera quaker oats cos aunt jemima 
pancake express with mix for six pancakes and a throwaway plastic 
mixing bowl and heinz usas plastic ketchup bottles 
the ketchup bottles are nonrecyclable because they are made of 
laminated plastic layers that cannot be separated easily juice 
boxes used by more than a halfdozen fruit drink producers pose the 
same problem because they contain layered plastic aluminium foil 
and paper 
while degradable plastic bags have been promoted as a 
partial solution to the landfill crisis the guide cited complaints 
from environmental groups that the bags only break down into 
smaller plastic particles which remain in the environment it also 
said they may not break down when buried and could weaken products 
made from recycled plastic 
in interviews spokesmen for some of the companies criticized by 
nypirg protested that they were squeezed by conflicting 
environmental concerns on one side and consumer preferences on the 
other 
were between a rock and a hard place said heinz 
spokeswoman beth adams because consumers prefer plastic bottles 
and only laminated plastic is airproof enough to keep ketchup from 
darkening 
she said heinz in pittsburgh continues to sell glass bottles 
but they now make up only about 35 percent of its bottled ketchup 
sales the company is searching fast and furious for a 
recyclable plastic bottle she said 
ron bottrell at quaker oats in chicago made a similar argument 
for pancake express saying the company had to balance 
conflicting concerns of environmentalists and of most shoppers 
while environment groups want biodegradable packaging 
consumers are telling us with their dollars that convenience is 
the driving force in their purchasing habits he said the food 
company is in the middle 
at kodak in rochester spokeswoman holly walkland read a letter 
prepared for customers who complain about the fling camera 
maintaining that it does not contain much more material than a 
dropin 110 film cartridge the letter also said photofinishers 
dispose of the camera in a manner prescribed by local 
ordinances 
walkland added that kodak was actively exploring not just for 
singleuse cameras but for all of our products how they can be 
recycled 
nypirgs romalewski said such promises were not enough for his 
group 
especially at a time when industries are trying to cash in on 
the green decade and this new environmentalism they cant just try 
to give the appearance that theyre doing good for the 
environment he said they have to take some tough action 
his group decided against boycotts because it believes they work 
only when targeted at a single product romalewski said he said 
nypirg instead hoped to make its point by inspiring complaint calls 
to the nearly two dozen companies whose products it criticized

president bush today proposed a 11 billion 
increase in federal spending for the war on drugs and said he was 
committed to marshaling everything that works to combat what he 
called the nations no 1 concern 
bushs 106 billion plan designates five regions new york 
los angeles miami houston and the southwest border of california 
arizona new mexico and texas as highintensity drug trafficking 
areas eligible for millions of dollars in additional federal help 
this year and next 
we want to help them map out a more comprehensive coordinated 
approach to fight drugs the president said in a luncheon speech 
to about 75 newspaper publishers 
he said his administration has made progress in battling drugs 
in the four months since he unveiled an action plan but added 
given the headlines weve seen recently its clear were only 
getting started 
he also called on congress to broaden the definition of 
drugrelated crimes for which the death penalty may be applied 
the budget proposal would spend 42 percent of the money for 
domestic law enforcement 29 percent for border interdiction and 
international operations and 29 percent for demand reduction said 
john walters chief of staff to drug policy director william j 
bennett 
to those who say our program looks topheavy on the 
interdiction side remember that many of the efforts to limit 
supply are exclusively federal and inherently more expensive than 
demand reduction bush said 
were willing to spend more to limit the drug supply simply 
put were willing to do whatever it takes 
bush made the comments as he unveiled what he called a 
blueprint for success a series of proposals that build upon the 
national drug strategy he announced last sept 5 
were committed to the same aggressive goals and principles we 
outlined last september to reduce use through an integrated mix 
of supply and demandside approaches and that means doing 
everything that works bush said 
he said illegal drugs remain this nations no 1 concern 
the president reiterated his earlier call for the death penalty 
for convicted drug kingpins responsible for drugrelated 
killings and he said even in some cases attempted killings 
we want there to be absolutely no doubt about the certainty of 
punishment bush said 
the proposal calls for allowing the death penalty for drug 
kingpins even when they or their organizations have not killed 
anyone for drug kingpins who attempt to kill in order to obstruct 
justice and for federal drug felons whose offenses result in 
death such as a drug users overdose 
bush also praised efforts by the leaders of mexico and colombia 
in fighting drug traffickers in their countries said said he would 
reinforce our support for the courageous leaders of the region 
at the upcoming feb 15 drug summit in colombia 
bush vowed to do what it takes to see drug operations 
dismantled and destroyed 
we dont make deals with dealers he said 
asked about arguments in favor of drug legalization bush said 
i just think that it would increase regrettably the habit and i 
strongly oppose it im just going to hold the line against 
legalization 
the updated strategy developed by policy director bennett 
emphasizes the crucial role of state and local governments to 
that end it calls for 26 billion in 1991 to be sent to the 
states for law enforcement treatment and drug prevention efforts 
a 108 percent increase over the past two years 
last september bush sought 79 billion for the war against 
drugs in 1990 but congress increased that to 88 billion the 
current proposal also is subject to congressional approval 
although 88 billion has been the universally recognized figure 
for the 1990 budget the new strategy uses new figures that take 
into account other drug expenditures already being made and says 
the country is now spending 95 billion walters said 
overall criminal justice spending will increase 2 percent to 
43 billion treatment goes up 12 percent to 15 billion 
educationcommunity and workplace funding goes up 11 percent to 
12 billion 
also international initiatives shoot up 65 percent to 690 
million interdiction efforts increase 17 percent to 24 billion 
research hikes 20 percent to 383 million and intelligence efforts 
zoom up 142 percent to 172 million 
meanwhile sen joseph r biden jr ddel told the national 
conference of mayors that the administration has placed too much 
emphasis on casual users and not enough on hardcore addicts 
its not that the administration doesnt care about hardcore 
users they do the judiciary committee chairman said as he 
touted his rival 146 billion antidrug strategy but that is 
not their main emphasis 
bennett told reporters earlier that the administrations plan 
was in 90 percent agreement with bidens and he wouldnt 
oppose it if congress decides to add more money for 1991 as it did 
for 1990 i could spend any amount of money on this he said 
the pentagon long reluctant to enter the drug war will 
contribute about 12 billion in 1991 with about 638 million of 
that going for detection and monitoring of traffickers trying to 
enter the country with illicit drugs according to the new 
strategy its efforts this year total 878 million 
bruce carnes bennetts budget specialist said the military 
drug war budget for 1991 represents the biggest dollar increase 
proposed in the strategy 
it is followed by the department of health and human services 
alcohol drug abuse and mental health administration whose budget 
would increase from 12 billion to 14 billion that includes 
almost 577 million in block grant money for drug treatment 
programs an increase of 100 million in such grants 
the third largest dollar increase is for the agency for 
international development moving from 48 million to 224 million 
much of that for the andean countries where most of the worlds 
cocaine is produced the fourth largest increase is for the drug 
enforcement administration from 549 million to 700 million in 
1991 
the designation of the highintensity drug trafficking areas 
applies to 1990 as well as 1991 according to walters the current 
budget allocates 25 million for those areas plus up to 21 
million more from the federal asset forfeiture fund said reggie 
walton associate director of bennetts office and the 1991 budget 
calls for 50 million for those areas 
but carnes said the areas actually will be receiving a total of 
12 billion worth of federal efforts this year and would receive 
a total of 14 billion in 1991 when all other federal programs 
and grants are included 
most of the help will be in the form of money going to federal 
agencies who will target those areas not in checks to the local 
governments 
the strategy listed metropolitan areas and surrounding areas 
that could be included as well as the cities in those surrounding 
areas 
the new york city area could include nassau county in new york 
and union hudson and essex counties in new jersey it said carnes 
said that area would receive 396 million worth of help in 1990 and 
436 million in 1991 
los angeles could include los angeles and orange counties and 
would get 151 million in 1990 and 169 million in 1991 
miami which could include broward dade and monroe counties 
fla could get 196 million in 1990 and 223 million in 1991 
houston which could include harris and galveston counties 
texas could get 168 million in 1990 and 187 million in 1991 
the southwest border includes 35 counties in california 
arizona new mexico and texas would receive 330 million in 1990 
and 368 million in 1991 
the total number of federal antidrug workers targeted to each 
area is new york 250 los angeles 300 miami 300 houston 200 
southwest border 700 carnes said

gorbachev has done a remarkable job in handling the ethnic 
unrest in azerbaijan and that the soviet president is really the 
best hope for continued peaceful change in the world

thinks should be in that job but as i look around i think mr 
gorbachev is really the best hope for what our interests are

publishers at the white house

unrest and they have been battling local resistance for several 
days

clint eastwood paying tribute to sergio 
leone at a film festival said one of the joys of working with the 
late italian director in the 1960s was that he lacked hollywoods 
ingrained selfcensorship 
sergio was not afraid to attack things that were forbidden 
eastwood said for instance you couldnt show a character 
getting shot sergio didnt know that so he went ahead and filmed 
it 
the two met in 1963 when eastwood accepted an offer to go to 
italy and make a fistful of dollars a western modeled on akira 
kurosawas samurai movie yojimbo 
the only italian word eastwood knew was arrivederci and the 
only english leone knew was goodbye the actor told movie buffs 
wednesday at the sundance united states film festival as a result 
eastwood said i just did my own thing and sergio went along with 
it 
one of leones trademarks was the extreme closeup sometimes 
framing only a subjects eyes 
actors love those tight shots said eastwood 59 but i 
was younger then now i tell them to take the camera back

czechoslovak president vaclav havel made a 
sentimental visit thursday to the warsaw theater where his plays 
were staged until the 1981 martiallaw ban and then revived as 
poland turned to democracy 
the teatr powczechny brought the playwrights work to audiences 
last year even while havel still was banned in czechoslovakia 
havel who was elected president dec 29 after czechoslovakias 
velvet revolution included a trip to the theater during an 
official trip to poland 
standing amid the crates and cages that form the set for one of 
his plays havel discussed characterizations and dialogue with the 
actors 
as havel signed underground copies of his plays one actor said 
he hoped he would not face arrest if he performed the presidents 
works in prague 
probably no havel replied the foreign minister is my 
close friend and he always asks me about everything 
havel was greeted by the theaters director andrzej wajda an 
internationally acclaimed filmmaker who said he felt he was 
welcoming the president home 
this is his house we are performing his plays he is our 
writer and that is why we consider us to be havels home in 
warsaw wajda said 
the director recalled the theater gave 11 performances of 
havels plays in 1981 before the martiallaw declaration that 
crushed solidarity and the cultural outpouring that accompanied the 
independent movement 
the home theater now presenting havels works at the 
powczechny was created by actors who performed banned works 
including his at private homes during the martiallaw period 
wajda said

president vaclav havel of czechoslovakia 
proposed thursday that his country poland and hungary work in 
unison to return to europe following decades of soviet 
domination 
he also called for an international peace conference that 
would put the definite period mark to world war ii and the cold 
war and the artificial division of germany and europe 
the goal is clear havel said 
we want to belong to a europe that is a friendly community of 
independent states a stable europe a europe that does not need 
protection from superpowers because it is capable of defending 
itself by constructing its own security system he said 
the ongoing helsinki treaty process and parallel disarmament 
talks should be accelerated to prepare the way to the peace 
conference he said 
then both military pacts could be dissolved and the process of 
alleuropean integration could be started including the 
reunification of germany within the present borders of east and 
west germany he said 
the former dissident playwright elected president last month 
after czechoslovakias peaceful anticommunist revolution told the 
polish national assembly that joint action to rejoin western europe 
would avert rivalry among eastern europes emerging democracies 
we should not compete in who is going to overtake whom and who 
will be first to win a seat in some european body but we should do 
just the opposite help each other in the spirit of that solidarity 
with which in worse times you protested against our repression and 
we against yours havel told the joint session of the polish sejm 
and senate 
western europe is much more advanced in integration processes 
and if we were to return to europe individually it would certainly 
take much longer and it would be much more complicated that if we 
act together he said 
this does not only concern economics it concerns everything 
including disarmament talks he said 
politicians in czechoslovakia hungary and poland support the 
withdrawal of soviet troops from their territory but each country 
has been discussing the issue separately with moscow 
havel said a power vacuum has existed in central europe since 
the collapse of the habsburg empire at the end of world war he 
said the countries of the region until recently colonized by 
the soviets should unite in a new formation 
such a grouping would not appear to rich western europe as an 
impoverished and helplesslooking amnestied prisoner but as 
someone who can also contribute something he said 
but havel said he could not predict the institutional shape 
of the proposed cooperation among the three countries 
he proposed that czechoslovakia host representatives of poland 
and hungary at the bratislava castle near the hungarian and 
austrian borders to discuss the form of alliance observers from 
other eastern european countries could also attend and eventually 
might join in the cooperative effort he said 
a polish government spokesman henryk wozniakowski said poland 
looks positively on havels proposition and would certainly 
be willing to take part in such talks 
havels speech was the high point of his oneday trip to poland 
his first since his student days in 1956 he planned to take his 
proposal on european integration to hungary on friday 
he was warmly received in parliament and was serenaded afterward 
by members with a round of sto lat may he live 100 years 
the audience chuckled when havel recalled the first meeting of 
czechoslovak and polish dissidents in the mountains along the two 
countries border in 1978 
he recalled how he jan litynski and adam michnik now both 
solidarity members of the polish parliament and jacek kuron the 
current labor minister laughed about being able to duck 
surveillance for the clandestine meeting 
if someone had told us then that in 12 years we would be 
deputies ministers and presidents then we would have laughed even 
more havel said 
in the visits only discordant note havel did not meet with 
solidarity leader lech walesa who refused an invitation citing 
prior plans to meet shipyard workers in gdansk and saying he did 
not want to have handshaking with no results walesa instead 
sent greetings to havel 
havel was welcomed thursday at warsaws military airport by 
communist president wojciech jaruzelski senior government 
officials a full military honor guard and the diplomatic corps 
he laid a wreath at the grave of the rev jerzy popieluszko the 
prosolidarity priest murdered by security police in 1984 it was 
the first time that an eastern european state leader had visited 
the grave 
about 1000 poles turned out to see havel who wrote in the 
guest book at st stanislaw kostka church where popieluszko is 
buried i have been moved for the first time since i became 
president 
he also visited a theater company that has been performing two 
of his plays for nearly a year when they still were banned in 
czechoslovakia

the japanese now own the publick house 
inn and run the food concession at historic old sturbridge village 
but the venerable yankee institutions promise tofu and sushi wont 
replace turkey and succotash 
this is an institution its a bastion of yankee cuisine 
said buddy adler innkeeper at the publick house historic inn 
built in 1771 by a revolutionary war hero it is what is to 
change it nobody would even contemplate that 
the inn a cluster of white colonial buildings dotted about the 
town common also runs the food service concession at old 
sturbridge village a living museum that recreates massachusetts 
life in the early 19th century 
crawford lincoln director of the nonprofit group that runs the 
village said thursday that he too doesnt expect any changes now 
that a japanese company owns the villages eateries 
indian pudding not sushi will be the order of the day from 
the food service he said 
the changes took place earlier this week when kyotaru co a 
japanese food service company bought restaurant associates of new 
york city for an undisclosed sum restaurant associates has six 
divisions with 120 fullservice restaurants and generates about 
240 million in annual revenue said company spokesman dennis 
rhodes in new york 
in the deal six top managers retained 15 percent of restaurant 
associates and will continue to operate the business hiroshi 
tanaka chairman of kyotaru will also be chairman of restaurant 
associates 
the acquisition included another venerable landmark the 
84yearold italian restaurant mamma leones in new york city 
rhodes said 
although the food will remain the same adler said he did not 
know whether japanese ownership will have any effect on the 
ambiance of the publick house which includes a 110room motor 
lodge and another restaurant and is listed on the national register 
of historic places 
the change will mean an infusion of capital and that could fuel 
expansion he said 
that was welcome news to sturbridge town administrator kevin 
walsh 
from the standpoint of the town of sturbridge infusion of 
capital probably means additional expansion and additional tax 
dollars if thats accurate thats certainly a positive note 
walsh said 
sturbridge a small town of about 7700 in central 
massachusetts draws thousands of tourists each year the 
population doubles to about 15000 during summer months 
about 350000 people come to see old sturbridge village to 
witness life in a recreated new england farm village the main 
restaurant is bullard tavern whose menu features such yankee 
staples as chicken pot pie and cranberry sauce 
old sturbridge village is a nonprofit living history that 
sets forth life in rural new england in the early 19th century and 
as such we will continue to hold fast to all aspects of the new 
england experience lincoln said 
he said the change of ownership could mean more visitors from 
the far east 
when visitors do arrive they will be pleased to find we have 
our map guide already printed in japanese said lincoln

about allegedly uninspected steel used in ticonderoga class 
cruisers to the supervisor of shipbuilding an onsite navy office 
that keeps an eye on biws construction of warships in bath 
the navy investigated bards charges first after he made an 
initial complaint and a second time when he complained again after 
being fired and found no problems with the biw steel ms oneil 
said 
bards firing had nothing to do with his whistleblowing biw 
said 
he was fired for being a lessthanadequate employee ms 
oneil said there were others who were making the same kinds of 
suggestions who are still there if they biw managers were 
worried about them they would have gotten rid of all of them 
there was no immediate comment from bard no phone number is 
listed for him in the bath area his attorney elliott l epstein 
of lewiston was not immediately available for comment thursday 
according to a secretary 
ms oneil said she was not certain what bard was seeking in his 
lawsuit but she believed he wanted back pay and possibly 
reinstatement 
bard initially filed a fourcount lawsuit against biw and the 
superior court dismissed three counts leaving one that alleged 
bards firing violated the maine whistleblowers protection act 
the lower court said that case would have to be tried by a judge 
and not a jury leading to bards appeal to the high court

balladeers of the sagebrush corralled their 
dogies and rode into town thursday to duel lyrics with bards from 
down under about life on the open range at the sixth annual cowboy

tradition said hal cannon cofounder of the event 
they have a similar stockmen tradition and their history of 
settling the outback is similar to our settling the west 
this years gathering is dedicated to curley fletcher one of 
the original cowboy poets who learned their craft sitting around a 
nighttime campfire

bronc gives the poems cowboy a hard time in the saddle and finally 
throws him to the ground

jailed black leader nelson 
mandela on thursday rejected reports that he has converted to 
capitalism saying he is firmly committed to nationalization of 
banks mines and monopoly industries 
mandela a leader of the outlawed african national congress has 
been jailed since 1962 he is expected to be freed within a few 
weeks and to play a role in promoting talks between the government 
and anc 
the united democratic front a nationwide antiapartheid 
coalition aligned with the anc released a oneparagraph statement 
from mandela that said he wanted to clarify his stance on economic 
policy 
the nationalization of the mines banks and monopoly 
industries is the policy of the anc and a change or modification 
of our views in this regard is inconceivable the statement said 
state control of certain sectors of the economy is unavoidable 
terror lekota chief spokesman for the front said the statement 
was issued because of innuendos in press reports that comrade 
nelson mandela no longer subscribes to nationalization and that in 
this regard he is in conflict with the external leadership of the 
anc 
the statement appeared to be a response to a jan 14 article in 
the nationally circulated sunday times it quoted wealthy black 
businessman richard mapanya as saying after a visit with mandela 
he did not believe in nationalization saying it was clear that 
such a policy ran counter to the need to keep south africa 
growing 
the ancs exiled leadership based in zambia says it envisions 
a mixed economy for south africa but has an ideological preference 
for socialism south africa currently has a capitalist economy 
dominated by the countrys 5 million whites 
an antiapartheid cape town weekly newspaper south on thursday 
published the text of lengthy statement it said mandela wrote prior 
to his meeting in december with president fw de klerk 
justice minister kobie coetsee said the government had no 
knowledge of any such statement some of mandelas colleagues said 
the statement even if authentic might be many months old 
the anc has no vested interest in violence the statement 
said but we consider the armed struggle a legitimate form of 
selfdefence against a morally repugnant system of govenrment 
the statement urged a negotiated settlement saying an 
overwhelming majority of south africans black and white hope to 
see the anc and the government working closely together to law the 
foundations of a new era in our country 
the key issue according to the statement would be how to 
reconcile blacks desire for majority rule with whites desire to 
avoid total domination by blacks 
mandela who is serving a life sentence for planning the start 
of the ancs antigovernment sabotage campaign has been meeting 
regularly with government officials and antiapartheid leaders a 
group of five activists visited him thursday at his quarters in a 
former staff home at victor verster prison farm outside cape town 
business day the countrys leading financial newspaper said 
thursday the government plans to partially lift the state of 
emergency and remove restrictions on the united democratic front 
the front was effectively banned two years ago but has been 
operating more or less openly since de klerk assumed power in 
august 
the business day report cited unidentified government sources 
who spoke to the newspaper following wednesdays meeting between de 
klerk and his cabinet 
de klerk is expected to outline his plans for reform when he 
opens parliament feb 2 
business day said de klerk probably will announce a partial 
lifting of the 43monthold state of emergency which gives 
authorities widespread powers to crackdown on antiapartheid groups

israeli warplanes blasted bases of three 
palestinian guerrilla groups in south lebanon on thursday in 
apparent retaliation for the killing of an israeli colonel in a 
guerrilla ambush police said 
one man was killed and three people were wounded they said 
a formation of four jets fired 16 rockets in two sorties on 
bases of the fatahrevolutionary council led by terrorist 
mastermind abu nidal the palestine liberation front and the 
popular front for the liberation of palestine headed by george 
habash 
israeli military officials declined comment 
the bases in kfar jarra the majdalyoun valley and mrah elhbas 
respectively are clustered in an area about a mile away from 
hilltop villages controlled by the israelibacked south lebanon 
army 10 miles east of sidon 
an official of the prosyrian marxist plf of talaat yacoub said 
the dead man belonged to his group 
an official of fatahrc said the radical faction suffered no 
casualities 
we vacated our bases sunday in anticipation of an israeli 
attack after the heroic operation at yaroun the official said 
the raid came five days after guerrillas shot and killed col 
yitzhak rahimov in israels selfproclaimed security zone he was 
the highestranking israeli officer to be killed in lebanon since 
israel withdrew the bulk of its forces in 1985 
fatahrc claimed responsibilty for the attack at the village of 
yaron one mile north of the international border 
a communique from abu nidals group later said the attack was 
only the first step in israels retaliation for the death of the 
israeli colonel 
this is not the retaliation the communique said of 
thursdays attack this is only the beginning of the retaliation 
there will be more attacks soon 
abu nidal the nom de guerre of sabri albanna split with 
yasser arafats mainstream fatah faction of the palestine 
liberation organization in 1973 he has been blamed for numerous 
terrorist attacks in europe and the middle east 
the raid was israels third on lebanon this year 
at least seven people were killed and 18 wounded in israels 
first and second attacks against bases of the proiranian 
hezbollah or party of god and a palestinian radio station both

the state department said thursday that 
romanias new leaders had gone too far in banning protests in 
bucharest and urged them to reconfirm their commitment to 
democracy 
the criticism contrasted with earlier bush administration 
support for the national salvation front the provisonal romanian 
leadership that took over in december after hardliner nicolae 
ceausescu was executed 
there have been reports that secretary of state james a baker 
iii might visit romania next month in conjunction with his trip to 
the soviet union and czechoslovakia but state department officials 
say no decision has been made about such a step baker arrives in 
moscow feb 6 for talks over the next two days with kremlin leaders 
we are deeply concerned about news reports that the decision 
of the national salvation front has imposed restrictions on 
demonstrations in bucharest said state department spokeswoman 
margaret tutwiler 
the romanian government issued its decree jan 3 in response to 
demonstrations and reissued it after a protest wednesday by 1000 
people demanding that the front refrain from taking part in 
elections set for may the decree outlaws demonstrations in 
bucharest and allows them only in some parks unless the protests 
are approved by police 48 hours in advance 
the right of citizens to express their opinions peacefully 
including the ability to march and demonstrate is a fundamental 
human right tutwiler said 
while we recognize that civil authorities may enact reasonable 
regulations to ensure public safety these restrictions appear to 
go well beyond this need 
some members of the front have been critical of the united 
states for not providing more economic help to their country and 
have asked for the restoration of trade concessions that ceausescu 
gave up 
the state department has indicated that any decision by congress 
and the administration on the trade concessions would depend on 
steps by the romanian government toward free elections 
the nsfs latest action is all the more disturbing in view of 
the fronts solemn pledge to the romanian people to build a 
pluralistic democracy and respect human rights as well as to carry 
out free fair and open national elections tutwiler said 
we call upon the nsf to reassure the romanian people and the 
international community that it remains committed to moving forward 
toward democracy she added

pope john paul ii began a 
tour of the impoverished sahel region south of the sahara by asking 
rich countries thursday not to abandon poor nations in favor of 
eastern europe 
the holy see and the pope feel allied with africa and 
other countries of the third world he told reporters on the 
flight from rome to this former portuguese colony off west africa 
we must present to the rich all the needs of the poor we must 
insist on solutions how can you not cry out in certain 
situations 
on the first stop of an eightday trip john paul also urged 
peaceful resolution through dialogue of crises in the soviet union 
including the violence in azerbaijan 
these are especially painful events we seek to participate in 
the events above all with prayer he said in response to the 
first soviet journalist to join one of the popes foreign tours a 
reporter for the labor newspaper trud 
asked what message he would send president mikhail s gorbachev 
the pontiff said i would wish him above all the gift of good 
advice 
john paul referred to his historic meeting with gorbachev on 
dec 1 at the vatican and said the soviet leader realized the 
importance of spirituality in his communist country 
perhaps i can say without betraying any personal secret 
gorbachev was very pleased with the popes prayers he said 
prayer is certainly a sign of spiritual order spiritual values 
and that we have a great need for these values 
to a question about how much violence could be justified in the 
us invasion of panama and the soviet military intervention in 
azerbaijan he replied that violence is always something morally 
negative morally bad 
he did not refer directly to either of the cases but said 
selfdefense could be justifiable in some situations 
we cannot deny the right of the socalled just war to this 
selfdefense either of an individual community or a people when it 
has suffered violence on the part of others the pope said 
his sixth voyage to africa the 45th foreign trip of his 
11yearold pontificate comes at a time when african leaders worry 
that their persistent need for aid will be pushed aside in the rush 
to support emerging democratic movements in eastern europe 
noting the current focus on that region which includes his 
native poland the pontiff said developed countries cannot 
abandon their common responsibility for the south for the problems 
of the third world 
for this i can thank providence that my journey is taking me 
precisely to africa this is an act of providence 
john paul emphasized that the duty to help poor nations falls on 
all countries of the north in which he included the soviet 
union and its allies 
cape verde and the other nations on his itinerary 
guineabissau mali burkina faso and chad are in the sahel a 
region afflicted by drought hunger disease and encroaching 
deserts 
i am traveling in african countries which are the poorest 
the pope said this trip is especially dear to me because we are 
going to meet the poor in the economic and material sense in a 
moral sense poverty means wealth 
he touched on the same theme in his remarks at praia airport to 
president aristides pereira 
the pontiffs white robes flapped in the strong wind as he 
declared in portuguese 
originally destined for all men the goods of this world will 
never reach this universal destination without the indispensable 
collaboration of the international community in the framework of a 
vast solidarity which includes everyone and responds primarily to 
the needs of the disadvantaged 
at the same time the recipients of aid should not become 
servile but maintain the dignity of the interdependence of 
peoples 
cape verde is an archipelago of 10 islands that gained 
independence in 1975 ninety percent of the 360000 people are 
roman catholic the highest proportion in africa 
john pauls next stop is guineabissau on saturday

a former diplomat who returned home 
after 50 years in exile said thursday he fears the gains of the 
prodemocracy revolutution are being thwarted by the provisional 
government 
ion ratiu who arrived wednesday joined opposition parties in 
denouncing the decision of the governing national salvation front 
to compete in elections in may 
this is a negation of democracy in my view he said 
for the second straight night about 300 people gathered outside 
front headquarters to demand the governing bodys resignation 
despite a ban on such protests 
the protesters about 150 feet from the building shouted down 
with the front and the national salvation front equals the 
commmunist party of romania between them and the building stood 
two lines of police and soldiers in armored vehicles their guns 
pointed at the protesters 
a similar rally wednesday ended peacefully 
in apparent response to that protest the governing body 
thursday again published in newspapers a decree outlawing 
demonstrations on bucharest streets without police permits 
critics say the provisional government cannot remain neutral if 
it takes part in elections that it administers and some accuse it 
of being a front for communist rule 
the us state department said thursday romanias leaders had 
gone too far in banning protests in bucharest and urged them to 
reaffirm their commitment to democratic rule 
three opposition parties called for the front to resign and for 
a broaderbased interim government to rule until the may 20 
elections the joint communique indicated the parties have formed 
an alliance against the front 
ratiu 72 heads the world union of free romanians the largest 
romanian exile organization 
ratiu was a romanian diplomat in britain in 1940 and asked for 
political asylum when a nazi government took over his country that 
year he moved to britain and became a millionaire through property 
and shipping interests 
ive come to this country after having been steeped in 
western democracy ive come to this country to help establish 
real democracy he said thursday 
asked whether he was worried about losing the gains of the 
revolution that ended oneparty communist rule ratiu said i am 
worried and certainly will do my best to prevent it because 
people sacrificed their lives for real democracy 
he said he was most concerned that the front was not providing 
equal access to all parties on radio television and newspapers he 
said he plans to start a newspaper 
ratiu hopes to be a candidate for the national peasant party in 
his hometown of turda in western transylvania 
asked if he would accept an offer to run for president he 
replied i will accept to serve in whatever capacity they ask 
me 
ion puiu the partys vice president on wednesday called ratiu 
one of the greatest figures of our party 
communist dictator nicolae ceausescu was overthrown in the 
revolution dec 22 and executed three days later and the national 
salvation front was to rule until the elections it first said it 
would not field candidates but it reversed itself tuesday 
illusions lasted only one month read a headline thursday in 
romania libera 
what kind of elections are we talking about when the national 
salvation front has monopolized in a totalitarian way all the key 
systems of the state read the opposition parties communique 
it repeated allegations that some front members were ceausescu 
henchmen who want to reinstate commmunist rule 
former foreign minister corneliu manescu was quoted thursday by 
the independent paris daily le monde as saying former senior 
communist officials were trying to reestablish the party 
i have been asked several times by former officials who 
perhaps have not committed the same mistakes as others to support 
the creation of a clean communist party manescu was quoted as 
saying manescu said he refused 
he was foreign minister from 1961 to 1972 and participated in 
the founding meetings of the front after ceausescus overthrow

the government nearly doubled its 
estimate thursday of how many ethiopians will need emergency food 
this year from 18 million to 34 million 
in its final crop assessment the marxist governments relief 
and rehabilitation commission also raised its estimate of the food 
required from 377400 tons to 662709 
most victims of the ethiopian drought are in the northern 
provinces of eritrea and tigre where rebel movements are active 
three months ago the un food and agriculture organization 
said at least 4 million people would need 700000 tons of relief 
aid in eritrea and tigre 
at the time the ethiopian relief commission called the 
prediction exaggerated misleading and politically motivated 
its latest report however conceded the commissions own 
assessment was essentially the same 
since our estimate does not include the assistance required to 
the nomadic areas the difference is negligible the government 
said 
in addition to problems caused by drought the government said 
unseasonal rain had damaged crops in several parts of the country 
it described harvests as generally good in central western and 
northwestern ethiopia 
officials told visiting church leaders from britain canada and 
the world council of churches last week the government had agreed 
on a food distribution program with a consortium of ethiopian 
churches 
included in the consortium are the ethiopian orthodox church 
ethiopian catholic secretariate and the mekane yesus evangelical 
church a protestant institution the churches run a program called 
the joint relief partnership 
neither the government nor consortium has given details of the 
plan the churches also have not said whether they have safe 
passage for relief goods from the tigre peoples liberation front 
which controls most of tigre province 
another possible complication arose last week when the eritrean 
peoples liberation front declared the red sea port of massawa 
where supplies would arrive a war zone eritrean rebels have 
captured a freighter in the red sea and have threatened to sink any 
ship found in the massawa area 
eritrean rebels have fought a separatist war for three decades 
in ethiopias northernmost province rebels in tigre just to the 
south want to overthrow the central government

a second prosecution to seek harsher 
sentencing is unlikely for an assailant imprisoned before the man 
he stabbed died after almost four years in coma a state prosecutor 
said 
although no formal decision has been reached it is virtually 
certain the assailant noel pagan will not be tried for 
manslaughter in the may 1985 stabbing assistant attorney general 
thomas goodwin said late wednesday 
pagan fought unsuccessfully last year to keep mark weaver the 
person he stabbed alive on a feeding tube so he would not face 
additional charges in the case 
a judge gave permission for weavers feeding tube to be removed 
last march and the braindamaged patient died eight days later at 
the age of 26 
goodwin said the possibility that the state could obtain a 
conviction against pagan on manslaughter would not justify the use 
of resources needed for another trial 
at the time pagan pled and was sentenced on the aggravated 
assault charge everyone understood that mr weaver was not going 
to make it and the judge probably took the inevitable death into 
consideration in sentencing pagan goodwin said 
pagan pleaded guilty to stabbing mark weaver in the neck and was 
sentenced to 10 years in prison with five suspended with accrued 
goodbehavior time he served a little more than three years and is 
now on probation and living either in massachusetts or connecticut 
goodwin said 
sylvia lane weavers mother said she had hoped the state would 
decide not to prosecute pagan again she said she bore him no ill 
will

a rifleman who participated in the 1968 massacre 
of vietnamese civilians in my lai blurted out a confession before 
being told of his rights the armys investigator says in a memoir 
published thursday 
the witness paul d meadlo came to his interrogation more than 
a year after the slaughter determined to relieve his conscience 
and describe the horrors of my lai retired col william wilson 
writes in american heritage magazine 
wilsons investigation for the army inspector general led to the 
courtmartial of former lt william calley meadlos platoon 
leader who was to be convicted of leading a slaughter of at least 
175 to 200 unarmed men women and children in the hamlet 
wilson said that when he embarked on the case it was viewed as 
factfinding rather than a criminal investigation he said he and 
col clement carney the inspector generals counsel not wanting 
witnesses to clam up decided not to open interviews with the 
warning that incriminating statements could be used in court 
but wilson wrote he was shocked at how precipitously meadlo 
admitted participating in the killing 
meadlo weeping immediately described standing guard over about 
80 villagers and calley ordering waste them wilson wrote 
meadlo said calley then opened fire on the villagers and meadlo 
joined in spraying four or five clips of ammunition when calley 
told him to shoot 
i stopped him and told him to wait outside the room wilson 
wrote 
he said he immediately called carney who instructed me to 
give meadlo his warnings and see if he would repeat the 
confession 
after he was warned that anything he said could be held 
against him in a court of law he said i dont care he repeated 
his confession wilson said 
meadlo went public with his confession on television later that 
year but when he testified at calleys trial it was under a grant 
of immunity and a threat of being held in contempt 
calley was convicted and given a life sentence that was knocked 
down eventually to three years of house arrest

iran has asked moscow to withdraw troops 
from azerbaijan and expressed willingness to help settle the 
dispute in the soviet republic tehran television reported thursday 
the broadcast monitored in nicosia said the call was contained 
in a letter from iranian foreign minister ali akbar velayati to his 
soviet counterpart eduard shevardnadze 
the letter was submitted to the soviet foreign ministry on 
wednesday by irans ambassador in moscow nasser heyrani nowbari 
the television said 
iranian president hashemi rafsanjani on sunday had instructed 
velayati to take serious steps to solve problems end bloodshed 
and halt further violence in the soviet republic that borders 
northwest iran 
at least 171 people have been killed in ethnic violence that 
broke out jan 13 between the republics predominantly moslem 
azerbaijanis and christian armenians living there 
nationalists in azerbaijan have turned the ethnic clashes into a 
call for secession 
soviet president mikhail s gorbachev declared a state of 
emergency in the caucasus republic and sent in red army units to 
quell the rebellion 
nowbari told the soviet deputy foreign minister alexander 
bessmertnykh that tehran was ready to offer any kind of help to 
solve the crisis in a just manner the television said 
it quoted him as saying that by supporting military 
intervention in azerbaijan the west is trying to push the soviet 
union into deeper crisis 
nowbari announced irans willingness to receive a soviet foreign 
ministry delegation for talks in tehran about the crisis the tv 
reported 
this was welcomed by the soviet union and it was decided that 
the visit should take place soon the report said 
iranian leaders have condemned the red armys crackdown on 
azerbaijani nationalists who are predominantly shiite moslems as 
are most of irans 55 million people 
the soviet media have accused iran of supplying arms to the 
nationalists a charge denied by iran 
gorbachev last week blamed moslem fanatics for triggering the 
violence in azerbaijan echoing longheld fears that irans shiite 
moslem zealots who seized power in a 1979 revolution would seek to 
export their fiery brand of islam across the border 
in an open letter to gorbachev an iranian student group 
denounced the massacre of moslems in soviet azerbaijan the 
islamic republic news agency reported 
an iranian daily thursday accused washington of encouraging 
gorbachev to send in troops to azerbaijan in hopes of deepening the 
crisis irna reported 
it quoted the farsilanguage jomhuri islamic as saying that the 
united states has figured any military confrontation between the 
soviet government and the people of azerbaijan will benefit 
washington because it will disrepute gorbachev and diminish his 
stature as the originator of a national and international reform 
irans socalled radicals are diehard supporters of spreading 
the islamic revolution to other countries while rafsanjanis 
pragmatic faction favors an opening to the west 
radio moscow on tuesday warned iran that actions taken behind 
moscows back in azerbaijan will have irrevocable 
consequences 
the warning broadcast on the radios farsilanguage service 
followed a call by more than half of irans 270 parliamentarians 
for moscow to deal with the azerbaijani moslems with compassion 
the radio clearly telling the iranians not to interfere in 
azerbaijan declared any unconsidered nationalistic or religious 
appeals would be dangerous brutal and illusory nationalistic 
flights of fancy have dragged the people to the brink of 
precipice

a synthetic compound has shown in laboratory 
experiments to prevent reproduction of the aids virus in a way 
different than azt the only antiviral drug now approved for use 
against aids researchers announced thursday 
the compound a manmade peptide called u81749 appears to block 
the final stage of a process the aids virus uses to reproduce 
itself in human cells azt or zidovudine attacks an earlier stage 
in the life cycle of the virus 
it u81749 drastically slows down and reduces the number of 
mature viral particles you get in an infection said leonard 
post director of infectious disease research at the upjohn co 
where the compound was developed 
post said the compound works by inhibiting the action of 
protease an enzyme used by the aids virus to process proteins 
during the final stages of its reproduction the result he said 
is that the virus cannot make mature copies of itself and this 
prevents the spread of infection to other cells 
he emphasized that the compound has been used only in test tubes 
on cultured cells and that it will be years before such a compound 
will be ready for human tests 
aids or acquired immune deficiency syndrome is caused by the 
human immunodeficiency virus or hiv when this virus invades a 
human cell it takes over the cells proteinmaking machinery to 
reproduce itself during this process the virus directs the 
creation of a number of different proteins protease is an enzyme 
the virus uses to chop up a large protein molecule called p55 
into several different types of smaller protein molecules needed to 
make a mature hiv particle 
post said that by blocking the action of protease the p55 
molecule is not processed and the viral particle does not mature 
dr bernard moss chief of the laboratory of viral diseases at 
the national institute of allergy and infectious diseases said the 
upjohn research has demonstrated a new vulnerable point in the aids 
virus 
the major significance of the work is that we are now 
attacking another target in the hiv virus said moss there are 
only a limited number of targets in the virus and protease is one 
of them a number of companies will be trying to develop such 
agents 
moss said that smithkline laboratories in philadelphia has 
developed a similar compound 
post said study with u81749 tells us were on the right 
track in developing a protease inhibitor he said a whole family 
of compounds such as u81749 are now being evaluated and it may 
take up to two years to determine which is the best to use in human 
drug trials 
moss said that developing a new type of antiviral aids drug to 
complement azt is an important goal in treating the disease azt 
has not been successful with all patients and some patients develop 
serious side effects from the drug 
by giving a combination of drugs that work at different stages 
of the life cycle of the virus it may give a better result he 
said 
the u81749 research was performed in upjohn laboratories by a 
team lead by wg tarpley a report on the study was published 
friday in science the journal of the american association for the 
advancement of science

the senate today upheld president bushs veto 
of a bill protecting chinese students from deportation handing him 
a narrow foreign policy victory in his first showdown this year 
with the democratic congress 
the vote was 6237 short of the twothirds margin needed to 
override a presidential veto 
shortly after the vote bush appeared in the white house 
briefing room to hail the action as reaffirming our commitment to 
chinese students in this country as well as the goal of improving 
relations with china 
he said that no student is going to be sent back against his 
or her will and that we will continue to urge china to respect 
the human rights of its citizens 
the issue which would affect an estimated 40000 chinese 
students studying in the united states took on added importance as 
the years first test of strength between bush and the 
democraticcontrolled congress and as a referendum on the 
presidents china policy 
republican sen william cohen of maine said in floor debate that 
he would vote against the president to uphold americas symbol to 
a world that is struggling to throw off the chains of dictators 
but sen frank murkowski ralaska said the issue was really 
a political challenge to the presidents constitutional authority 
i believe the challenge is illadvised works against our national 
interest and is likely to cause a further deterioration of our 
relationsihp with china 
in the days before the vote the white house had mounted a 
fierce lobbying blitz which included telephone calls from bush and 
other top administration officials to wavering senators and 
personal visits from vice president dan quayle the vice president 
presided over the chamber during the vote and his spokesman dave 
beckwith said that was his way of thanking republican senators 
when they were personally inclined to vote the other way 
former president richard m nixon who laid the groundwork for 
modern uschina relations with a diplomatic opening in the early 
1970s telephoned some senators to say bushs position was in the 
longterm interests of the united states 
during a lively debate sen alan simpson rwyo said some 
democrats were guilty of political opportunism and were using the 
vetooverride fight to take a gratuitous chop at george bush in a 
partisan way 
sen edward m kennedy dmass called that hogwash 
id like to believe that there are people here who are 
speaking for the freedom lobby kennedy said his voice rising 
were talking about an issue of fundamental importance that has 
swept the world 
senate majority leader george mitchell dmaine noted that many 
republicans had supported the bill originally including 26 who 
urged bush in a letter not to veto it now theyre being asked to 
reverse themselves out of personal loyalty he told reporters 
before the vote 
the house voted 39025 on wednesday to crush bushs veto of the 
legislation designed to shield chinese students in the united 
states from deportation and political harassment democrats 
complained bushs policies are too warm toward the regime that 
killed prodemocracy protesters in beijing last june 4 
the legislation applied to as many as 32000 chinese students 
now in the united states on exchange visitor visas the bill 
would waive a legal requirement that those students go home for two 
years after their visas expire before returning to the united 
states or going elsewhere 
in addition the bill would permit any chinese students whose 
visas expire as many as 8000 others to remain in the united 
states as long as danger exists at home and would allow chinese 
students to work while in this country 
bush vetoed the measure on nov 30 after it passed unanimously 
in the house and by a voice vote in the senate chinese student 
groups had lobbied hard for an override saying many of them would 
face political persecution at home because they supported the 
prodemocracy demonstrations that brought a violent government 
crackdown 
when bush vetoed the bill he ordered government agencies to 
adopt what he contends are essentially the same safeguards the 
veto was an effort to preserve executive branch foreign policy 
prerogatives he said and to keep open the door for future student 
and cultural exchanges 
i will not break faith with the chinese students here 
they were safe then and they are safe now and they will be safe 
in the future bush told a white house news conference wednesday 
he listed steps the beijing government has taken which he said 
justified his policy toward china the lifting of martial law in 
the capital the release of jailed demonstrators a promise not to 
sell mediumrange missiles to syria acceptance of peace corps 
volunteers fulbright scholars and a voice of america correspondent 
back into the country and the muting of antius propaganda 
but critics countered that the missile promise was nothing more 
than a repeating of assurances given months before the crackdown 
the effects of martial law remain in place and arrests harassment 
and secret trials of prodemocracy agitators continue they also 
contended bushs administrative actions to protect the students can 
be revoked at any time and could be subject to a court challenge

here is the text of presidents bushs 
statement thursday announcing his drug plan at a white house 
luncheon for newspaper publishers 
well please be seated and please continue with your coffee 
but its an honor to have you all here and there may be no 
group in american more aware of the challenges this country is 
facing so my first thought was to give you a general outline of 
our agenda after our first year 
but then i decided to focus on the first item on the domestic 
agenda illegal drugs 
and they remain this nations number one concern and so i chose 
this forum to announce the second phase of our fight against drugs 
this booklet is on our national drug control strategy that i hope 
we can get distributed to all of you 
as you know last september for the first time we launched a 
comprehensive coordinated and i think coherent national strategy 
to stop the distribution and the use of illegal drugs weve made 
some notable progress in the months since the plan was unveiled 
attitudes continue to change 
here in washington the number of those arrested who test 
positive for drugs has dropped dramatically over the past three 
months especially among juveniles 
and abroad colombia has extradited 14 of the worlds major drug 
merchants to stand trial here in the united states given the 
headlines we have seen recently though its clear that we are only 
really getting started and the plan we laid out last fall outlines 
what we intend to do and today i want to announce the second 
phase as i said of our strategy which explains how we intend to 
do it agency by agency task by task dollar by dollar 
and today were releasing a what i think of as a blueprint 
for success our outstanding director bill bennett drug control 
policy director will discuss the program later in depth 
and right now i want to just sketch out if i might a few of the 
highlights and then open the floor to questions 
our approach remains consistent were commited to the same 
aggressive goals and principles that we outlined last september to 
reduce use through an integrated mix of supply and demand side 
approaches and that means doing everything that works 
our strategy calls for about a third of its funding to go toward 
drug education prevention treatment and research were calling 
for more prevention programs in schools and workplaces as well as 
grants for communities to set up education programs 
in our treatment strategy were also emphasizing what works 
with careful and constant evaluation of treatment regimes and a new 
office for treatment improvements at hhs 
were funding new research in areas like law enforcement 
technology treatment and drug use forecasting that will help us 
spot trends and then target our resources and measure the impact 
of our strategies 
and this spring were going to be releasing the first of an 
annual statebystate status report measuring progress 
rougly another third of the budget is devoted to domestic 
enforcement prosecution incarceration 
to help local law enforcement initiatives the 91 fiscal budget 
calls for nearly 500 million for state and local law enforcement 
grants an increase of 228 percent over the last two years we want 
to get the right resources to the right people on the right level 
street level 
today well be announcing five highintensity drug trafficking 
areas cities and areas that are already doing a great deal but 
need more support and we want to help them map out a more 
comprehensive coordinated approach to fight drugs 
were also increasing the number of dea and fbi agents and 
personnel as well as more funding for assistant us attorneys 
we support an increase in federal judgeships 
were proposing the death penalty for drug kingpins and those 
responsible for drug related killings and even in some cases 
attempted killings we want there to be absolutely no doubt about 
the certainty of punishment 
and the final third of our budget is earmarked for border 
interdiction and the international operations side we want the 
multinational criminal organizations that produce and distribute 
drugs to be more than disrupted we intend to see them dismantled 
and destroyed because we dont make deals with these dealers 
we have multilateral programs underway in many parts of the 
world 
throughout central and south america particularly were engaged 
in expanded and unprecedented levels of cooperation and assistance 
we applaud the efforts of president virgilio barco of colombia and 
also of president salinas our neighbor president salinas of 
mexico 
and i will reinforce our support for the courageous leaders of 
the region at the upcoming drug summit at cardagena 
among the steps were taking to intensify border control up to 
an additional 1000 customs agents who are already on the job will 
be given authority to conduct drug investigations to better assist 
the dea the drug enforcement administration 
with interdiction in particular coordination is absolutely 
crucial and were putting an end i hope and i believe we are 
putting an end to turf battles 
i met with all our top law enforcement people the other day and 
they said they had never seen better cooperation between these 
powerful in some instances but between all the agencies 
our budget for all international activities has increased from 
419 million to nearly 700 million were creating a new national 
drug intelligence center to ensure all enforcement agencies get the 
strategic and organizational intelligence that they need 
more

treasurys newly created financial crimes enforcement network 
will improve financial intelligence and the department of defense 
has been increasingly effective in its expanded detection and 
monitoring roles 
now i imagine the news in this chapter of the war on drugs may 
be its price tag spending understandably gets a lot of attention 
and in this case outlays continue to increase but i want to 
emphasize our determination to win this fight without adding to the 
budget deficit and yes i repeat without raising taxes 
in 1990 drug funding totaled almost 95 billion that was in 
1990 the largest increase in history funding for fiscal 91 
will be expanded by more than 1 billion to over 105 billion and 
outlays will increase 41 percent this year in fact with this 
request the federal drug budget will be 69 percent higher than it 
was when i took office in 1989 
and to those who say that our program looks top heavy on the 
interdiction side remember that many of the efforts to limit 
supply are exclusively federal and inherently are more expensive 
than demand reduction 
were willing to spend more to limit the drug supply simply 
put were willing to do whatever it takes 
but the real issue of course is not how much it has got to be 
how well and here the distinction between federal and national is 
crucial 
a truly national drug control strategy demands that we tap 
resources of every description public and private civilian and 
military local state and federal volunteer professional and 
personal 
let me tell you about a man that i know many of you in this room 
know but some may not jim burke corporate leader former ceo 
of johnson and johnson whos been applying the power of the media 
to unsell drugs through the media partnership for a drugfree 
america the largest volunteer private sector ad campaign since 
the war bond drives of world war ii 
hes energized and hes doing a superb job youre all familiar 
with those hardhitting ads to discourage drug use many of you 
already contribute space to run them and thats supporting the 
partnerships current goal to raise 1 million a day in advertising 
time and space every day for the next three years a remarkable 
goal indeed 
and i know that some of you joe williams of the memphis 
commerical appeal to take a notable example has made a promotion 
of volunteerism an important part of the newspapers mission and 
thats also very very important 
the free press has a right and a responsibility to comment and 
report on a nations problems but your newspapers may also 
contribute to the progress of the communities they serve by 
pointing to solutions 
and there may be no better outlet for americas volunteer 
volunteer effort volunteer spirit than saving those being lost 
to drugs 
its too early to tell how our efforts will be judged but if 
more concerned americans become involved americans i believe we 
will succeed

the nations bigcity mayors on thursday 
dismissed as inadequate the billiondollar increase in the war on 
drugs proposed by president bush and said it shortchanges their 
efforts to treat addicts 
we cant win the war on drugs with 106 billion said 
philadelphia mayor w wilson goode citing the size of the federal 
antidrug effort proposed by the white house 
it is woefully inadequate said new york mayor david 
dinkins whose city was among those that would get special 
attention and money as a highintensity drug use area under 
bushs proposal 
itll make some difference but not much dinkins said 
the mayors were attending the winter meeting of the us 
conference of mayors a gathering bush plans to address on friday 
his appearance will be the first by a president since president 
carter a decade ago 
goode and dinkins both democrats were joined by other 
democratic mayors and two republicans richard l berkley of kansas 
city mo and sue myrick of charlotte nc at a news conference 
providing the organizations official response while bushs plan 
won modest praise as a step in the right direction none of the 
mayors suggested the proposal was close to adequate 
the president of the conference democrat president kathryn j 
whitmire of houston bushs adopted hometown said the size of 
bushs proposal suggested the drug problem is not at the top of the 
nations agenda despite political rhetoric to the contrary 
she said mayors agree the federal government should provide 
direct aid to the nations cities rather than through state 
governments as it does now a study released by the group this week 
found only 15 percent of two key grant programs for law enforcement 
assistance made it to city governments last year 
she said mayors also believe federal antidrug efforts must be 
sufficient for cities to provide drug treatment for all addicts 
many cities have waiting lists for treatment now 
the mayors pointed to the 50 billion savingsandloan bailout 
package passed by congress last year and said if the nation is 
serious about fighting drugs it should provide a similar amount to 
this effort 
we believe we could solve the problem if we had 50 billion 
goode said 
san diego mayor maureen oconnor said bushs proposal amounted 
to 44 per person with only a few pennies additional for 
treatment while the sampl bailout costs 208 per person 
until we put the same amount in fighting drugs we have not 
made it our top priority whitmire said 
several mayors voiced general support for a 146 billion 
alternative described to them earlier in the day by senate 
judiciary committee chairman joseph biden ddel 
bidens plan would provide immediate treatment for all pregnant 
women and young children who want it and would provide treatment 
on demand by any drug abuser in four years he said

warring nationalists agreed thursday to a 
ceasefire along one of the tense battlefronts of the bloody 
conflict between armenia and azerbaijan tass said 
the announcement came as baltic activists worried that the 
dispute might affect their own peaceful push for independence 
offered to help mediate the blood feud between armenia and 
azerbaijan 
iran which has ethnic and religious ties to azerbaijan also 
offered to help settle the crisis 
there were fewer reports of fighting thursday tass said life 
was returning to normal in baku the azerbaijani capital that was 
the scene of much of the violence 
during talks in the armenian town of yeraskhe representatives 
of the armenian allnational movement and the peoples front of 
nakhichevan agreed to lay down their weapons the soviet news 
agency said 
according to the agreement along the entire border between 
armenia and the nakhichevan autonomous region all exchanges of fire 
between opposing informal groups must stop tass said 
nakhichevan is culturally and politically a part of azerbaijan 
although it is physically separated from the republic by armenia 
which lies on its northern border it is bounded by iran on the 
south and a small section in the west borders turkey 
tass did not say whether the truce was holding it also was 
uncertain whether the two organizations could enforce it 
martin martirosyan a spokesman for the the armenian 
allnational movement said no agreement had been reached yet on an 
exchange of hostages he said three armenians were being held by 
azerbaijanis 
tass also said a truce was reached on the border of armenias 
idzhevan district and azerbaijans kazakh district 
christian armenians and moslem azerbaijanis have been feuding 
for the past two years primarily over control of nagornokarabakh 
a section of azerbaijan populated mainly by ethnic armenians 
the feud has exploded into a virtual civil war and has fueled a 
nationalist movement to make azerbaijan independent of the soviet 
union 
on jan 1314 azerbaijanis attacked ethnic armenians living in 
the baku killing dozens fighting between armed groups has killed 
dozens more 
on jan 19 soviet soldiers moved into baku to smash barricades 
set up by nationalists and end the bloodshed in less than two 
weeks of violence at least 171 people have been killed 
the 130mile border between armenia and nakhichevan has been 
among the most tense in the struggle on sunday a funeral was held 
in yerevan armenia for an armenian nationalist leader mofses 
gorgisyan who was killed in fighting there last week 
witnesses said they have seen nationalists fighting there with 
automatic weapons and artillery taken from soviet soldiers 
tass added that a meeting of the leaders of the informal 
organizations would take place saturday to agree on further 
separating the militias 
the fighting is perhaps the biggest internal crisis that has 
faced president mikhail s gorbachev during his nearly five years 
in power gorbachevs fostering of greater freedom has helped spur 
the nationalist movements in several soviet republics and in the 
east bloc 
president bush praised gorbachev thursday as the best hope 
in the soviet union for the united states and he declined to fault 
him for using force to restore order in azerbaijan 
i want very much for him to succeed i think he has conducted 
himself in an extraordinarily difficult situation very well he 
remains committed to peaceful change and i dont think anyone is 
faulting him for the difficulties that he has encountered in 
azerbaijan bush said giving his strong endorsement to the 
soviet leader for the second straight day 
in london prime minister margaret thatcher told the house of 
commons she had great sympathy for gorbachev as he tries to 
keep his nation from unraveling 
in an interview with the wall street journal she was quoted as 
saying the reunification of germany which one east german 
official on thursday called inevitable could topple gorbachev 
the proindependence movements from the baltic republics of 
lithuania latvia and estonia stepped into the dispute between 
armenia and azerbaijan they called for nationalist groups in the 
warring republics to take part in a peace conference monday in 
riga the latvian capital 
spokeswoman anda anspoka of the latvian peoples front in riga 
said the armenian allnational movement confirmed it would attend 
but the azerbaijani peoples front was not expected to decide 
until friday whether to participate usus samed ogli a front 
director said by telephone from baku ogli said front leaders had 
gone underground because they fear they will be arrested by the 
kgb but that the group would meet friday to discuss the peace 
conference 
political movements in the baltic republics have been pressing 
peacefully for greater autonomy and have a strong interest in 
avoiding the precedent of the military moving in to restore order 
an airlift of families of ethnic russian servicemen was 
suspended thursday because the danger had subsided said foreign 
ministry spokesman gennady i gerasimov more than 30000 people 
had been evacuated since the airlift began he added 
tass said tensions in baku were easing the news agency said 
stores were reopening a newspaper began publishing again and 
transportation was resuming earlier it was reported to be 
paralyzed by a strike to protest the soviet occupation 
azerbaijanis have pledged not to end their strikes until soviet 
troops withdraw 
the republics central committee convened late wednesday after 
a nighttime curfew began and ousted abdulrakham vezirov from the 
party less than a week after he was removed as party chief he was 
accused of making serious mistakes that led to the crisis 
gerasimov said military forces arrested 20 people after boarding 
two merchant ships that led a blockade of the baku harbor that was 
broken wednesday 
tass cited baku radio as saying troops had detained mamed 
alizade chairman of the defense committee of the azerbaijan 
peoples front

the crippled iranian tanker khark 5 may again be 
leaking crude oil off the cape verde islands in a serious 
manner said a statement released thursday by the environment 
ministry 
attempts to transfer 53 million gallons of oil remaining on the 
khark 5 to another tanker are threatened by rough seas near its 
position off west africa the statement said the ministry listed 
no source of information and there was no independent confirmation 
late thursday from other countries of a leak 
the dutch salvage company smit tak which is heading operations 
to save the ship and shift its cargo of crude to the iranian tanker 
shir khooh has consistently said all leaking has stopped 
the khark 5 lost 19 million gallons of iranian light crude after 
a dec 19 explosion ripped a hole in the vessels hull before 
drifting seaward the resulting oil slick threatened moroccos 
fisheries and beaches but authorities said warm offshore waters 
helped break up virtually all of the slick 
smit tak hopes to transfer the remaining oil in international 
waters about 300 miles from the cape verde islands after the 
blast spain portugal morocco and cape verde barred the khark 5 
from entering their 200mile territorial waters for fear of 
pollution 
rough winter weather has prevented the salvors from beginning 
the threeday pumping operation 
the explosion which occurred in stormy weather 400 miles north 
of las palmas in the canary islands began a fire that forced the 
khark 5s crew to abandon ship nobody was injured in the incident 
the cause of which has not been determined

americans wages salaries and other benefits 
rose 5 percent last year the government said thursday in a report 
that economists took as a sign that high labor costs may worsen the 
nations inflation problems 
the labor department said its employment cost index considered 
one of the best gauges of inflationary wage pressures showed an 
increase equal to the 5 percent rise in 1988 in employment costs 
rising health care costs in part pushed the index forward both 
years the agency said 
the increases in compensation showed that labor costs are 
failing to moderate despite a slower economy some analysts said 
thats because the slowdown has not pushed the unemployment rate 
much above its 15year low of 5 percent last march the jobless 
rate was 53 percent last month 
the slowdown has been too mild to rein in compensation 
costs said robert dederick chief economist at northern trust 
co of chicago while this is good in the shortterm for the 
worker it raises the question that inflation is going to 
increase 
allen sinai chief economist at the boston co called the 
report disappointing because its very hard for me to believe 
that overall inflation will come down much 
benefit costs jumped 61 percent in 1989 compared to a 68 
percent gain in 1988 but the 1988 increase was attributed in part 
to a 5 percent increase in the employers social security tax rate 
escalating health insurance costs last year kept the cost of 
benefits high even without a big change in the social security tax 
the labor department said 
before 1988 benefit costs had grown consistently for the past 
three years at about 35 percent 
its going to be a steady fight to bring that down 
economist cynthia latta of drimcgraw hill said of the 61 percent 
hike in benefit costs theyre trying to pass this on to workers 
and thats going to take a while 
while overall employment costs rose wage and salary increases 
lagged behind inflation for the third straight year they grew by 
42 percent in 1989 under the years 46 percent inflation rate 
in 1988 wages and salaries were up 41 percent while inflation was 
44 percent 
according to the labor department employment costs for state 
and local government workers rose 62 percent up from 56 percent 
in 1988 
it cost private industry employers 48 percent more last year to 
pay wages salaries and benefits than it did in 1988 the 
department said compared with a 49 percent gain in 1988 over 
1987 federal government costs are not included in the report 
sales workers whose pay is heavily influenced by commissions 
experienced a 7 percent wage jump in 1989 compared with a 66 
percent gain in 1988 and just a 1 percent gain in 1987 
workers in the rapidly expanding service sector of the economy 
where the tight labor market is felt experienced a 45 percent 
wage gain while those working in goodsproducing industries saw 
their pay increase on average by 39 percent 
for the sixth straight year nonunion workers in private 
industry received greater wage and salary increases than did their 
unionized counterparts with the increases averaging 41 percent 
and 31 percent respectively 
state and local government workers received on average a 53 
percent pay gain in 1989 up from the 48 percent increase of 1988 
with the increase in that sector highest among hospital workers 
who averaged 61 percent pay raises

president bushs plan to spend about 106 
billion on the war against drugs in 1991 sticks to a 
heavyonlawenforcement theme with almost fourfifths of the 
money devoted to enforcement at home and abroad 
at the same time the proposed drug war budget up almost 12 
percent from this years spending of 95 billion would hike 
treatment funds by 12 percent to 15 billion and education 
community and workplace useprevention funds by 11 percent to 12 
billion 
the breakdown comes to 42 percent for domestic law enforcement 
29 percent for border drug interdiction and international 
operations and 29 percent for demand reduction said john walters 
chief of staff to drug policy director william j bennett 
to those who say our program looks topheavy on the 
interdiction side remember that many of the efforts to limit 
supply are exclusively federal and inherently more expensive than 
demand reduction bush said in a speech to newspaper publishers 
as he unveiled the updated version of the strategy announced in 
september 
were willing to spend more to limit the drug supply simply 
put were willing to do whatever it takes 
if congress goes along with bush local and state officials will 
get their hands on 26 billion or about onefourth of the total 
through grants for law enforcement treatment and prevention 
efforts a 108 percent increase over the last two years 
the five regions designated as highintensity drugtrafficking 
areas new york los angeles miami houston and the southwest 
border of california arizona new mexico and texas will benefit 
from total federal efforts of about 12 billion this year and if 
congress approves 14 billion in 1991 
the agency that would get the largest chunk of the 106 billion 
is the alcohol drug abuse and mental health administration part 
of the department of health and human services which would be 
given 14 billion of that 577 million would be for block grants 
for drugtreatment programs an increase of 100 million 
the agency that would receive the second largest amount is the 
pentagon with 12 million of which 638 million would go for 
detection and monitoring of drug traffickers crossing the us 
borders and 227 million would be for operational costs such as 
flying and sailing time walters said 
the state departments agency for international development 
would get 224 million up from 48 million much of the money 
would go to aid the andean countries where most of the worlds 
cocaine is produced 
the drug enforcement administration would get 700 million up 
from 549 million to raise the number of dea personnel from 5224 
to 5601 elsewhere in law enforcement the budget envisions money 
for about 410 additional federal prosecutors an additional 100 fbi 
workers and 75 new federal judges 
overall criminal justice spending would increase 2 percent to 
43 billion international initiatives would shoot up 65 percent 
to 690 million interdiction efforts would increase 17 percent to 
24 billion research would rise 20 percent to 383 million and 
intelligence efforts would zoom up 142 percent to 172 million 
in other areas the drug strategy 
calls for almost doubling funds for eradication of domestic 
marijuana production to 35 million in 1991 this was done in 
part walters said to show foreign governments urged by the united 
states to stamp out their drug production that the us government 
is serious about wiping out domestically produced supplies as well 
envisions spending 400 million in prevention and treatment for 
pregnant women who use drugs and for their children part of an 
effort to combat the problem of cocaine babies and those born 
addicted to other drugs 
continues the andean strategy launched last september by 
spending 22 billion over five years in drug law enforcement and 
economic development funds for colombia peru and bolivia the 
proposed budget would increase from 217 million in 1990 to 423 
million in 1991 including 50 million in additional aid for 
colombia walters said 
the five areas of the country designated as highintensity 
drugtrafficking areas appear on the surface to be slated to 
receive only 25 million this year and 50 million next year 
but they actually will receive help worth a total of about 12 
billion this year and presuming congress agrees 14 billion next 
year most of the aid would be in the form of additional federal 
agents assigned to those areas to enhance law enforcement and 
interdiction efforts but some of that money will come in the form 
of block grants similar to those being given out nationwide 
according to bruce carnes bennetts budget specialist the new 
york city area which could include nassau county in new york and 
union hudson and essex counties in new jersey would receive 396 
million worth of help in 1990 and 436 million in 1991 
los angeles which could include los angeles and orange 
counties could get 151 million in 1990 and 169 million in 1991 
miami which could include broward dade and monroe counties 
could get 196 million in 1990 and 223 million in 1991 
houston which could include harris and galveston counties 
could get 168 million in 1990 and 187 million in 1991 
the southwest border which could include 35 counties in 
california arizona new mexico and texas could receive 330 
million in 1990 and 368 million in 1991 
the total number of federal antidrug workers targeted to each 
area is envisioned as new york 250 los angeles 300 miami 300 
houston 200 and the southwest border 700 carnes said

law enforcement officials in president bushs newly designated 
highintensity drugtrafficking areas said they were pleased with 
the prospect of more dollars and more attention focused on their 
regions 
we certainly need more people down there said jim piatt 
regional commissioner for the us customs service based in 
houston we need more people looking at cars coming across the 
border we need more officers looking at cargo we need more canine 
teams we need more technology 
the president thursday proposed a 11 billion increase in 
drugfighting funds on a wide variety of fronts including new 
spending in five highpriority areas new york miami houston los 
angeles and the mexican border area from texas to california 
piatt said the mere designation of houston and the border as 
drug target areas was very important 
what thats going to do is beyond whatever additional money 
houston gets with this drug strategy what its going to do is add 
focus all the various federal agencies are going to realize 
theyre going to have to put more resources into these areas to 
work on this drug problem so i think there are going to be a lot 
of spinoff benefits 
he called houston a conduit for smuggling across the border 
theres a lot of drug drug money thats floating around to the 
extent that we can work on joint money laundering projects a lot 
of that money can go right back to the city 
on the technology side he suggested that theres got to be a 
way we can xray vehicles and trucks that would certainly make us 
far more effective than we are now 
in miami customs commissioner carol hallet said she was 
delighted with the new initiative 
we are in this war to win it and customs the coast guard and 
the dea will help us see an end to this scourge that is a global 
problem 
we will study the high intensity areas to see what needs to be 
done 
the new federal funds includes increases for education and 
treatment but the focus in the miami region will continue to be on 
halting drug shipments ms hallet said 
customs she said will continue to be the lead agency when it 
comes to interdiction on the land we will be adding not only 
agents but additional inspectors and k9 teams 
miami mayor xavier suarez said he has always been pleased with 
federal help in antidrug efforts in the region but wished the new 
money would give local officials had more say in how it was spent 
wed like to have some discretion on the use of the money 
he said 
two southern california congressmen said the declaration of los 
angeles county as a highintensity drug trafficking area was a long 
overdue step 
rep mel levine said the bush administration seems to 
understand the seriousness and magnitude of the drug problem facing 
los angeles county but must allocate even more resources to the 
area 
the resources announced today are woefully inadequate and need 
to be dramatically increased levine said in a statement 
rep howard berman who like levine is a democrat said the 
administration should have taken the step a year ago and in the 
meantime much ground was lost 
i hope the administration realizes that excellent as this is 
its jut a start berman said 
in new york mary cooper a spokeswoman for the new york region 
of the drug enforcement administration said officials in her 
office were meeting thursday to discuss the anticipated extra funds 
and new york city police sgt ralph st just said if any of the 
funds make it to the local level thats when nypd will decide 
weve got to have it in our possession before we decide what 
were going do with it said st just

rival shiite moslem factions fought 
shelling duels in south lebanon on thursday and president elias 
hrawis government endorsed a plan that would ban militias in 
moslem west beirut 
christian radio and television stations ended a weeklong 
newscast strike after a compromise was worked out with gen michel 
aoun leader of a renegade christian army on the titles of rival 
government leaders 
police said at least five fighters of the proiran hezbollah or 
party of god were wounded when a tank cannon fired by the 
mainstream shiite amal militia blasted their position in iqlim 
altuffah 
a police spokesman who cannot be named in line with standing 
regulations said amal and hezbollah were reinforcing their 
positions and massing fighters in an apparent preparation for 
resuming ground offensives 
the latest casualties raised the overall toll to 98 killed and 
286 wounded since dec 23 when the latest round of amalhezbollah 
clashes for control of the 12 million shiites broke out in the 
province 
the shiites are the largest community in lebanon which has a 
population of 4 million people belonging to 17 sects 
renewal of the amalhezbollah confrontation after a 16day 
relative lull underlined the failure of iranian and algerian 
mediations to halt the intermittent 2yearold conflict that has 
killed 930 people and wounded 2753 
police said renewal of the amalhezbollah hostilities led to an 
exodus from disputed villages of the mountain regions east of the 
southern provincial capital of sidon 
the few civilians who had returned to their homes during the 
lull left late wednesday the police spokesman said 
meanwhile hrawis government announced that it approves a new 
security plan banning militias from operating in beiruts western 
sector 
soldiers of gen emile lahouds 22000strong army loyal to 
hrawi are to carry out the new security plan soon the 
statement said it did not set a date 
the statement said the lebanese soldiers are to deploy in west 
beirut in coodination with the syrian forces it did not 
disclose further details 
one source speaking on condition of anonymity said the new 
security plan covers the western edge of south beirut but not the 
slums that are a traditional hezbollah stronghold 
the lebanese army will not move into bir elabed and the other 
hezbollah districts in south beirut the source said without 
further elaboration 
some of the 18 western hostages are believed held by 
hezbollahaffiliated underground factions in the slums of south 
beirut where the syrians do not maintain any presence 
the security plan reached earlier this week during three days 
of talks between hrawi and syrian president hafez assad in 
damascus appears to be similar to one applied by the syrians when 
they moved into west beirut to end three years of militia anarchy 
feb 22 1987 
leftist and moslem militias were then banned by the syrians from 
operating in west beirut and hezbollah maintained its control over 
the citys southern slums 
however leftist and moslem gunmen reemerged in west beirut 
last summer during a sixmonth artillery confrontation between the 
syrians and aouns 20000 troops the syrians made no moves to 
prevent the militias from returning to the capital 
aoun has vowed to drive the syrians from beirut and has refused 
to recognize or take part in the christianmoslem government headed 
by hrawi and formed last year with syrian support 
christian radio stations resumed newscasts thursday after media 
in the christian enclave reached a compromise with aoun 
according to the compromise reported by voice of lebanon and 
voice of free lebanon radio stations hrawi will be referred to 
only as mr elias hrawi 
the compromise also allows the media to refer to aoun only as 
gen michel aoun and not as interim prime minister 
hrawi immediately upon his election as president nov 24 
dismissed aoun as army commander and interim prime minister 
aoun on jan 16 banned the media from referring to hrawi as 
president recalling that he had declared parliament dissolved to 
prevent the election of a prosyrian head of state

this is the text of president bushs thursday 
news conference on the senate vote to uphold his veto on 
legislation affecting chinese students in the united states 
president bush well i have two subjects id like to address 
myself to first i want to acknowledge the vote in the senate 
upholding my veto this afternoon and reaffirming our commitment to 
chinese students in this country as well as the goal of improving 
relations with china no chinese student in this country is going 
to be sent sent back against his or her will and we will 
continue to urge the peoples republic of china to recognize the 
human rights of its citizens to participate in the affairs of the 
world community 
and i do want to express my personal thanks to the leadership of 
the republican party in the senate sen dole sen simpson who 
led this effort with courage and determination and a special 
thanks to all of those members who voted for the values of justice 
and human freedom that i believe were at stake in this question 
secondly this morning i called president endara of panama to 
assure him of our continuing support of his efforts to establish 
democracy in panama now part of this effort involves the 
establishment of a healthy economy and i am deeply impressed with 
his commitment to reform panamas economy and based on this 
commitment and the report i received from larry eagleburger and 
john robson with us here i informed president endara that wed 
arrived at an economic assistance package to help assist panama in 
its economic recovery 
our plan valued at about a billion dollars includes 500 
million in humanitarian assistance for housing emergency public 
works business assistance loans guarantees and export 
opportunities and then a 500 million in addition assistance 
package for balance of payment support public investment and 
economic restructuring the vice president will review the details 
of this plan with president endara on his visit to panama and 
were going to work closely with the congress on this package to 
ensure its prompt implementation the economic challenges that 
panama faces are great but we will work with the people to build a 
prosperous democratic nation 
ive just met again with secretaries robson and eagleburger and 
they believe given the history in panama the business side that 
this economic assistance can indeed result in the shortrun in a 
very in a vastly improved economic situation helen 
q mr president isnt it about time that you told the american 
people what were the results of two secret missions to china 
whether you got any kind of promise from beijing for losening up 
and becoming a more tolerant society and will this victory lead 
now lead you to try to lift the sanctions against china 
a well i think i addressed myself to that yesterday but let 
me repeat i was very pleased at their lifting of martial law i 
was very pleased at the release of 573 people from jail in a kind 
of an amnesty ive said that these werent all the steps that need 
to be taken im very pleased that theyve stopped harassing the 
united states mission there our embassy in beijing im very 
pleased that theyve lightened up on the areas where i think we can 
really move things forward and that is the peace corps and the 
fulbright exchanges 
so this was all part of the debate on the hill and i must say 
that i think that the fact that they had made those moves carried 
some weight with some of the senators 
q well is that the promise that you were given and they say 
now that martial law is still 
a no promises im looking for action not words 
q how about the sanctions 
a thats a third question and what sanctions which part of 
the sanctions 
q the military technical assistance 
a well were looking at the whole performance scale and i 
expect they are too so but im very very pleased with the 
results on the hill today yeah terry

president gen ibrahim babangida signed a 
decree thursday reducing the military governments power to detain 
people without charge from six months to six weeks 
the decree imposed in 1984 permitted senior government 
officials to order the detention without charge of people deemed to 
be security threats the detention orders allowed detention of up 
to a halfyear and could be renewed 
the new decree limits detentions to six weeks at which time 
they can be renewed but must be reviewed by a panel made up of 
government officials religious leaders a retired judge a 
representative of the nigerian bar association and others 
the decree also authorizes only the general chief of staff of 
the military to order detentions previously the minister of 
international affairs and inspector general of police also had the 
power to authorize detentions

the government was bowing to demands for a relaxation of the decree 
from human rights groups and the bar association

q mr president there are 535 members of congress 62 
supported you on this veto do you view that as any kind of a 
aside to other reporter no overall returning do you view 
that as a mandate for your policies 
a yeah because youve got to give disproportionate weight to 
how the executive branch feels were an equal branch so you add 
to that the support on the hill we come out more than equal 
q and does it give you any support for new initiatives toward 
china 
a it gives me the thing i like about it given the mournful 
predictions of some a couple of weeks ago is that it gives me the 
confidence that im going to go forward the way i think is correct 
here and ive had a lot of chance to talk to people that voted 
with us and some that didnt and i understand their sensitivities 
and i vow to do a better job of informing them as these things 
develop as to what it is were intending but im very very 
pleased with the results for reasons that im sure everybody out 
here can understand yeah brit and then charles 
q mr president back to the chinese students for a moment 
does your commitment that no chinese student would be sent back 
against his or her will does that run absolutely or is that 
something that will run until such time as you feel that china has 
changed its ways in some way that meets your approval 
a against his will his or her will is the controlling 
statement yeah yeah charles 
q mr president on the aid to panama some assessments say 1 
billion is only a fraction of what it will need to restore the 
effects down there what is your assessment and what are people 
saying is this what youre hearing 
a well im basing my judgment on what president endara said 
and on the recommendations of the economic mission that went there 
and president endara seemed very pleased at this i said to him 
if theres additional categories where we can in which we can 
be helpful please let me know but i think he was very pleased 
and i think both larry and john feel that it is a very good step 
whether its the last step or not i dont know weve got to see 
how that private sector responds and how you know how the 
economic recovery goes forward but i wouldnt say this is the end 
of the road in terms of what we can do to help them 
q is there a full assessment of what the total cost will be 
a well i think they feel that this is lets go here see 
what happens and then take another look some may come up with 
higher figures but this is what we think is a good and full 
program to give them the help they need right now yes 
q mr president have you been personally briefed on the exact 
number of people left homeless as a result of the us invasion of 
panama and when specifically sir can they expect to get new 
homes to replace those 
a i think these programs will give instant or as close as 
instant relief as we can hope for here in fact theres a 
provision id like to ask larry and john to take a couple of 
questions after i bail out on this that will address themselves in 
more specificity because i dont have the exact number there but 
i would like to help as best i can with the reconstruction yes

president bush vowing to do whatever it 
takes proposed a 11 billion increase thursday for the war 
against drugs targeting more money for a pentagon attack on 
cocaine traffickers and urging the death penalty for drug kingpins 
overall bushs package would total 106 billion and boost the 
cost of the nations drugfighting strategy in fiscal 1991 by 116 
percent over current spending of 95 billion 
a rival plan from the chairman of the senate judiciary 
committee sen joseph biden ddel would cost 146 billion 
give the presidents drug policy coordinator cabinet status and 
outlaw semiautomatic weapons 
bush said he expects the senate will try to approve a higher 
budget than he is asking but said we do sense a desire on the 
part of the congress to cooperate 
in terms of the objectives of this strategy were in pretty 
close accord with both democrats and republicans on the hill so i 
think we can get early action bush said early congressional 
reaction split predictably along party lines 
calling drugs this nations no 1 concern bush announced 
his proposal in a white house speech to newspaper editors 
the plan is the second phase of the drug war strategy unveiled 
in september and targets five areas for intensified federal 
drugfighting efforts 
while claiming progress in the drug war bush said given the 
headlines weve seen recently its clear were only getting 
started 
in response to a question bush said he felt great sadness 
great tragedy over the arrest of district of columbia mayor 
marion barry on misdemeanor cocaine charges 
my thought went to the kids kids in the schools its a 
matter of sadness and barbara bushs wife shares my view on 
this 
the president also vowed to hold the line against proposals 
to legalize drugs 
were willing to spend more to limit the drug supply bush 
said calling his package a blueprint for success 
simply put were willing to do whatever it takes he said 
his plan designates five regions new york los angeles miami 
houston and the southwest border of california arizona new mexico 
and texas as highintensity drugtrafficking areas 
federal antidrug efforts in those areas will benefit from 
millions of dollars in additional federal help this year and next 
the current budget allocates 25 million for the worstafflicted 
areas plus up to 21 million more from the federal asset 
forfeiture fund said reggie walton associate director of 
bennetts office the 1991 budget calls for 50 million for those 
areas 
bush said onethird of his drugcontrol budget would go toward 
education prevention and treatment programs another third to 
domestic enforcement and the final third for border interdiction 
and international operations 
bennetts office however said that 29 percent of the money 
would go for education and other demandreduction efforts 42 
percent for domestic enforcement and 29 percent for border 
interdiction and international efforts 
the largest spending increase would go to the pentagon to expand 
its drugfighting role it would receive 12 billion up from 
about 878 million in the current fiscal year which ends sept 30 
about 638 million of the pentagon funds would be earmarked for 
detection and monitoring of traffickers trying to enter the country 
with illicit drugs 
moreover the plan envisions ship and aircraftdetection 
activities in the caribbean sea in concert with foreign 
governments 
our approach remains consistent to reduce use through an 
integrated mix of supply and demandside approaches and that 
means doing everything that works bush said 
the secondlargest increase would be for the department of 
health and human services alcohol drug abuse and mental health 
administration which would have its budget increased from 12 
billion to 14 billion 
that includes almost 577 million in block grant money for 
drugtreatment programs an increase of 100 million 
bush said he was proposing an increase in fbi and drug 
enforcement agents as well as 75 new federal judges 
we are proposing the death penalty for drug kingpins and those 
responsible for drugrelated killings and even in some cases 
attempted killings bush said 
we want there to be absolutely no doubt about the certainty of 
punishment he said currently the maximum penalty for leaders 
of continuing criminal enterprises is life imprisonment 
we want the multinational criminal organizations that produce 
and distribute drugs to be more than disrupted we intend to see 
them dismantled and destroyed because we dont make deals with 
dealers bush said 
he also praised efforts by the leaders of mexico and colombia in 
fighting drug traffickers and said said he would reinforce our 
support for the courageous leaders of the region at the feb 15 
drug summit in colombia 
congressional reaction to the president split largely along 
party lines with democrats saying more money is needed to get to 
the root of the drug problem and republicans lauding bush for 
seeking 11 billion more for the drug war 
rep charles rangel dny and chairman of the house narcotics 
committee said the bush plan failed to address lack of education 
and unemployment which rangel said must be faced as part of the 
drug battle 
biden said bush should target casual users less and hardcore 
addicts more 
but sen robert kasten rwis said bushs plan signals the 
kind of gettougher approach that the public is crying for 
when the mayor of the capital city of the free world is 
arrested for crack use the american public knows that the drug 
situation in this country has gotten out of hand

q i know youre talking about foreign policy but may i ask you 
a drug question since you were talking about that today though 
a yes sir 
q given the fact that in your inaugural address you talked 
about the promise to stop the scourge of drugs and given the fact 
that today you told the newspaper publishers that drugs was at the 
top of your agenda is this going to be the primary test for your 
administration in its first four years at least in its primary 
domestic phase assuming the economy doesnt fall apart is this 
the big one 
a i think its the big one and i think its a test not for the 
administration but for every community in the country every 
state every local local government for the people and somebody 
asked me if you had to set goals changes in the education system 
or but where could you most readily hope to see results i would 
say in the antinarcotics fight i think its really that kind of 
priority yes dave 
q mr president can you 
a youre next michael 
q going back to china you gave us an accounting of why gen 
scowcroft went in december but i wonder if i could ask you to go 
back to july could you give us an accounting of that trip what 
happened what did you learn why did you send him then 
a to see to make clear to the chinese leadership that the 
relationship is important but that it could not go forward until 
certain changes were had taken place and that in sum is what 
it was about 
q was it your initiative or theirs sir 
a mine my initiative yeah 
q back to the override vote does this suggest to you your 
victory today that if you can win here you can win on anything 
with congress 
a no because i think we had very good case here if i took a 
case up there that wasnt any good well id probably get beat 
but this one i think people you know were willing to listen 
some that had been positioned opposed to it opposed to my 
position and i think when they heard the full argument i think 
they decided well we should support the president on this one 
q could you expand a little bit on that mr president given 
that youve pointed out repeatedly that you have done 
administratively what congress sought to do legislatively 
a yeah 
q why was it so important to win this vote 
a well i said yesterday i mean for several reasons one 
reason i think there was a political ingredient in it and nobody 
likes to get unintelligible on that and also i think from a 
foreign policy standpoint i think its better to do it this way i 
think there is a trust factor that hopefully will result in changes 
that are satisfactory to the american people and to me a trust 
factor in the administration and i hope that i can use that 
having won this now to further the kinds of things that i think 
will help move china forward 
see just as back i think that the unilateral decision by 
president nixon to send kissinger on a secret mission to establish 
contact in days when they were far darker in chinas us relations 
was a good decision and i think the decisions ive made are good 
decisions i can understand the controversy and i can understand 
why there wasnt excuse me a unanimous endorsement but i view 
this im not i view it as a very good step i will pledge right 
here to work with the congress i love the way the debate ended 
with both sens mitchell and dole saluting each other for the way 
in which the matter was discussed and i think thats a good signal 
for the political fights that may lie ahead and michael 
q if i could follow up on davids question 
a yeah 
q you said that mr scowcrofts trip in july the chinese 
were told certain things had to happen for the relationship to go 
forward could you elaborate on those things 
a no i cant do it 
q tell us what happened 
a no because i think that weve seen china take certain steps 
and in diplomacy i dont think you make progress by throwing down 
a list of things telling somebody else how to behave i do think 
you adhere to your own principles and i think sometimes you have to 
undertake the kind of diplomacy that i engaged in here to reiterate 
principles and to explain the severity of problems to people but 
if you do it publicly all the time and you do it so youre painting 
somebody into a corner i dont think you get results and thats 
why i did what youve done 
q is the status of mr fang one of those things that needs to 
be resolved 
a i hope they it certainly is a matter thats on that i 
would like to see resolved yes yeah jim

would have traded all the glitter for one happy longlasting 
marriage 
thats what i grew up hoping to find one good man i could 
love and marry and cook for and make a home for who would stick 
around for the rest of my life she said in an interview with

defense secretary dick cheney is sending 
congress a sweeping list of proposed military base closures and 
reductions in moves president bush pledged on thursday will not 
cut the muscle of our defense 
while bush and cheney have both declined to outline the exact 
number or scope of the changes pentagon and congressional sources 
said the suggestions target dozens of installations 
i have a threeinch folder on my desk outlining the changes 
said one pentagon official 
last week cheney promised that the hit list would be 
extensive above and beyond the 86 domestic bases that congress 
agreed last year would be closed a blueribbon panel made that 
recommendation a device widely expected to be resurrected in order 
for congress to swallow any of the proposed changes 
cheney is slated to formally unveil the list on monday but 
officials have already begun notifying congressional delegations of 
the proposed shutdowns and changes congressional sources said 
the pentagon and congressional sources who spoke on condition 
of anonymity warned that lastminute changes could be made given 
the volatile political nature of the suggested cuts 
the sources said the list of suggested closures and reductions 
has targeted among others 
the philadelphia naval shipyard a shipbuilding and repair 
center which has 9000 military and 20000 civilian workers 
in california san franciscos treasure island naval station 
the alameda naval air station the oakland naval supply center and 
the oakland naval hospital as well as the long beach naval 
shipyard 
the armys fort monroe a training center in hampton va 
the armys 2nd armored division at fort hood texas which 
would be disbanded under the plan about 10000 soldiers 
onefourth of fort hoods troop population are connected with the 
armored division at the base the largest military installation in 
the free world 
part of the division is stationed in europe and pentagon 
officials stressed that any reduction in forces there would be 
along the lines of superpower arms control reduction pacts 
fort ord calif would be closed and the 7th infantry 
division stationed there would be transfered to fort lewis wash 
the 9th infantry division at fort lewis is slated to be sharply 
cut back 
besides the reductions in europe several military 
installations in the pacific are also on tap for closure the 
sources said 
sen phil gramm rtexas said he could neither confirm nor deny 
speculation that besides fort hood bergstrom air force base and 
the red river army depot might be affected 
gramm said he did not believe any hard and fast decisions 
had been made and that the speculation of targeted bases could be 
nothing more than trial balloons being floated by the pentagon 
as the reports surfaced accusations and denials of partisanship 
surfaced 
one pentagon source argued that officials werent being 
political about the changes because some of the best friends of 
the military such rep marvin leath dtexas a member of the 
armed services committee had bases in their districts that had 
been targeted 
however leath whose district contains fort hood has 
announced that he will retire at the end of this year 
if we were really partisan wed be going into rep patricia 
schroeders dcolo backyard he said really this is all 
designed to make military sense 
but some of the congressional sources contended that liberal 
democrats districts were being targeted under the plan 
another pentagon source noted that such proposals are always 
bound to produce complaints and that cheney fully expects it 
this is just the tip of the iceberg the source said of the 
reported closures theres a whole lot more coming 
weve warned all along that reductions in the military budget 
are going to be painful added one military official 
bush asked about the affect such closures might have during a 
session with newspaper publishers said the defense department was 
wrestling with this whole concept of what facilities will remain 
as fully funded in the future as they have in the past 
the president admitted that the issue was a hot potato 
politically and one he himself has been guilty of battling 
against 
were all familiar with what happens everybody says cut and 
then when somboedy has to make the call they say please cut in 
this other guys district dont cut in mine mines absolutely 
essential 
and i was guilty of the same thing when i was a member of 
congress and so i understand it bush said i think we can come 
up with a formulation of where we have to cut doing it in a way 
that we dont cut into the muscle of our defense

president bush on thursday said that the 
arrest of district of colombia mayor marion barry on a cocaine 
charge was a great tragedy that made him think of the impact on 
schoolchildren 
the mayor was arrested by federal agents at a local hotel last 
week and charged with one misdemeanor count of possession of crack 
cocaine 
asked his reaction bush told newspaper publishers thursday 
great sadness great tragedy my thought went to the kids the 
kids in the schools its a matter of sadness barbara shares my 
view on that 
he declined to comment further saying it would be most 
inappropriate for a president to prejudge a matter that is in the 
court 
asked whether the mayor should resign he said i dont want 
to get into the case because i think it would be inappropriate 
lets let the system work i think the city is capable of making 
that determination 
later bushs drug policy director william bennett said the 
barry case might be one of these watershed kind of events that 
changes peoples attitudes on drugs 
bennett refused to comment directly about barry but said his 
government had been a barrier to a concentrated federal effort to 
help the city deal with its drug problem 
we threw a rope to a city drowning and we found a lot of knots 
got tied but there wasnt enough pulling to get up bennett said 
every american has to weep a little bit for this city and 
for the fact that its the murder capital of the country bennett 
added

liberian soldiers accused of 
massacring civilians are leaving few survivors in their relentless 
search for rebels near the ivory coast border diplomats and 
medical workers said thursday 
they tell really horrendous stories of soldiers spraying 
entire villages with 50caliber machine guns a western diplomat 
said bullets from such heavy weapons tear huge holes in bodies 
the diplomat and ivorian sources estimated at least 500 
civilians had been killed in liberias eastern nimba region since 
soldiers were sent to stop rebel attacks that began dec 24 
refugees say there are not many wounded people because the 
soldiers slaughtered so many the diplomat said he visited 
refugees tuesday with ivorian officials aid workers and other 
diplomats from nations donating food medicine and money 
officials fear an outbreak of disease because of a stream of 
refugees estimated thursday to number more than 60000 about 
12000 to 15000 other liberians have sought refuge in guinea the 
diplomat said 
at the ivorian border village of danane refugees tell of 
dashing to safety in the forest when they hear the daily 
machinegun fire across the frontier 
they are traumatized by the combat and watching some of their 
relatives being killed said claude regnier a french adviser to 
the ivory coast government who heads a committee coordinating aid 
to the refugees 
when the gunfire starts they rush to the forest and come out 
only when it stops he said in an interview 
a western diplomat said the killing began in liberia after 
rebels from the gio tribe increased attacks in an attempt to oust 
president samuel doe who seized power in 1980 from the descendants 
of freed american slaves who founded the west african nation in 
1847 the gio long have felt oppressed by does krahn tribe 
it started with gio rebels attacking military outposts in 
their own ethnic heartland in nimba county the diplomat said 
also speaking on condition of anonymity the army came in and 
just went nuts because everyone looks like a rebel to them there 
has been some very heavyhanded slaughter 
the rebels retaliated about 10 days ago by moving south into 
traditional krahn territory and slaughtering civilians there he 
said that caused a second wave of victims to flee east into ivory 
coast and north into guinea he said 
killings of innocent people continue despite a warning from doe 
on monday that soldiers who harmed civilians would be executed the 
diplomat said 
doe told reporters thursday the army was having difficulty 
containing the situation in nimba because the rebels used 
hitandrun tactics and that it was hard for his soldiers to 
identify rebels wearing civilian clothes 
he added however that security forces had been cautioned to 
distinguish more carefully between civilians and rebels 
initially justice minister jenkins scott said soldiers killed 
only armed civilians who attacked them 
regnier said 40 percent of the refugees were women and children 
and 30 percent boys or youths doctors said refugees hospitalized 
in ivory coast included a 5yearold girl shot in the leg 
dr maurice kouame director of man hospital a regional health 
center 75 miles from danane said his staff was caring for only 
eight seriously wounded liberians he said people with light wounds 
were treated at a clinic in danane 
among the eight was a man whose arm had been hacked off kouame 
said in a telephone interview 
according to regnier refugees have crowded into a 30mile 
stretch along the ivorian side of the border and have been taken in 
by villagers of the same language and culture he said many were 
related 
they are sleeping 40 to 50 in a hut regnier said

q mr president on capital gains you pointed out on several 
occasions that because of parliamentary rules youve been thwarted 
youve asked that congress give the majority the right to exercise 
their will by passing capital gains 
a yeah 
q now in this case you technically won on this veto because of 
parliamentary rules but the vast majority voted against you on 
this dont you believe that that is in fact a repudiation of 
your chinese policy 
a no i dont see a parallel this is executive branch youre 
equal with the legislative branch the whole ball game is entitled 
to have the veto process part of the election is about the veto 
process its not a question of whether but when you have a 
majority of senators up there doing one thing thats fine 
provided the president agrees with it but thats what im saying 
i mean 
q but im talking specifically about what congress did over the 
last couple of days 
a surprised you didnt it 
q the majority of congressmen in both the house and the senate 
voted against you on this issue do you that thats a repudiation 
by congress of your chinese policy 
a no theyre entitled to do the thing and the executive is 
entitled to do its thing and it worked and were going to stay 
right on track and i think the process worked very well i dont 
view it as a repudiation at all yeah 
q mr president i understand that transportation secretary 
skinner was among those making calls on the vote 
a i hope so 
q well thats just a little pork barrel persuasion as well 
but was there something more than just the pure merits of this 
a highways in china what are you talking about laughs 
q well i mean was it just the pure merits of the case that 
won the day or was it you know win one for the 
a i think there was some politics in it i think there was 
politics in it 
q on both sides 
a yeah both sides id say yeah because some of them said 
look lets stand with the president some that may have had a 
slight difference of emphasis on our side and clearly there was 
plenty on the other side when you dont see one single vote come 
across the aisle not one 
q did you 
a not one 
q make specific promises to anyone on 
a no 
q help on any other issue 
a no uhhuh yes 
q mr president youve spoken of a trust factor 
a responding to an offmike comment inaudible a great 
big fat one coming over the pike excuse me 
q on the trust factor i wonder if i can apply that to the 
american people sir what can you say to convince the people that 
the missions to china werent secret simply to avoid the 
overwhelming public opposition to them 
a i say i think what im doing is correct and i say i think i 
was elected to do in foreign policy what i think was correct and 
you have the checks and balances of the congress they had a shot 
to say that it wasnt correct in this instance and so i say that i 
feel encouraged that the process worked out this way and i point 
back to the original relationship with china and i dont believe 
youd have ever had it if there hadnt been some secret diplomacy 
yeah

sister r mildred barker the 
spiritual leader of maines tiny shaker community died thursday 
after an extended illness she was 92 
her death leaves just eight shakers in the last active maine 
community of the protestant faith said leonard brooks director of 
the shaker museum in gloucester where the group has its 1900acre 
farm 
a religous sect that flourished in the 19th century shakerism 
practices celibacy and a communal life revolving around worship and 
farming 
sister mildred was put in charge in 1931 of the shakers jelly 
and jam industry as well as a candymaking business she made 
sales trips as far away as boston and sold eggs in portland maine 
the shakers said in a statement 
in 1950 she was chosen trustee of the community overseeing 
business and financial matters the community raises sheep and 
grows apples and herbs 
sister mildred was born in providence ri on feb 3 1897 
and at age 7 after her father died her mother placed her among the 
shakers brooks said

mildred in 1983 for her expertise in singing old shaker songs many

sister mildreds single greatest delight was singing the 
beautiful old shaker hymns that had been taught to her in her 
youth the statement said she personally knew thousands of 
songs and sought to preserve them

q if i could ask the question again sir what 
a you might youll get the same answer if you ask the same 
question 
q were the missions not kept secret to avoid the overwhelming 
public opposition to them 
a no the missions were kept secret because i believe this is 
the best way in dealing with china to effect change positive 
change yes 
q mr president as youre aware china issued an angry 
statement overnight over the house action yesterday referring to 
their vote as interference in chinas affairs you warned yesterday 
about chinas action if your veto was not sustained what i dont 
understand is why china would since youve promised to do the 
same things administratively that the pelosi bill would have done 
why 
a yeah 
q china would regard that as interference but you doing it 
they wouldnt 
a i think they would see it as a further public slap at a time 
when they feel some steps have been taken that are positive and i 
think that is probably what but let there be no mistake about it 
they im sure theyre not very happy with my executive order i 
mean theyre entitled to their view and were entitled to ours 
and i have a mandate to protect these students and china as you 
know has a very different view on it but i think thats the only 
thing i can think of yeah 
q may i ask on a different topic on the middle east youve 
had three press conferences in two days now and theres been no 
questions at all about the middle east is this a signal that your 
administration and that the american public as a whole is disgusted 
with the slow pace of events towards the peace process 
a no because i dont write the questions for the press 
conference i mean i cant help it if they had no questions but 
i dont think there should anything in the status quo should be 
interpreted as a lack of interest in trying to be helpful on the 
talks going if thats what you mean in fact there is discussion 
going on we had discussions with our most recent visitor 
president salih ive just concluded a meeting with senator specter 
who is just back from syria and from iraq and theres a lot going 
on 
i wish i could tell you i felt that there was demonstrable 
progress but no please dont assume because ive addressed 
myself in the statements to the china question and the question of 
panama or the question of our domestic agenda that we have lost 
interest in trying to be a catalyst in the middle east 
q do you think one side is being more recalcitrant than the 
other 
a i dont think it would be helpful to quantify recalcitrance 
i think what we ought to do is what jim baker is trying to do right 
now and that is to facilitate the talks to get them started yeah 
q mr president with this victory in the senate do you 
anticipate sending gen scowcroft or perhaps some other envoy back 
to china to talk again perhaps in the open this time 
a im not sure scowcroft and eagleburger want anymore grief 
like this laughs theres no plans to do laughs you know 
theres no laughing let me be very clear this again and 
im not dodging the question one there are no plans for anything 
of that nature secondly this was my idea for good or for bad 
and these are seasoned diplomats and seasoned people in national 
security and we talk about these matters and when the president 
makes a decision why they they do what i suggest here 
and so i dont want to be doing anything other than expressing 
total confidence in them and in their mission and i know its been 
controversial but im not im not somebody thats always looking 
for a way to do something in secret when i see though back to the 
question i was asked that in my judgment a quiet conversation 
might lead to progress i hope i will continue to feel i have the 
flexibility to pursue such a conversation yeah

q mr president when you send your memorandum of disapproval 
of the china students bill you characterized it as a pocket veto 
and said that the constitutional provision precluded it becoming 
law and yet we havent heard you object to the fact that the 
congress took the vote to override have you changed your mind on 
that 
a i need a lawyer on that one i dont i really am not 
sighs i dont change 
q i certainly would like to follow it up somehow 
a well yeah lets get lets i think we should get 
q you need a lawyer here 
a i really do laughter that gets technical and i cant 
q some people said that by sending the message back you undid 
your pocket veto and actually gave them a veto to override but i 
dont think the white house accepts that and id certainly like to 
get an answer to that 
a yeah let me get you an answer because were not seeking to 
do some clever parliamentary maneuver to have people have to vote 
on this question when i you know would rather have seen the 
matter lie dormant yeah in the middle 
q you indicated in the beginning of your statement that you 
feel you do have a mandate now on this china policy a lot of 
people have criticized it as a secret policy you also indicated 
that perhaps you might do more to keep congress informed why not 
keep them informed of these secret missions and what do you plan 
to do in terms of keeping them informed 
a well i think we do we bend over backwards to keep people 
informed in the congress and i think once in a while there is 
something that is done quietly and then when it is proper why 
well give a thorough and full briefing and i think in this one 
when this matter was disclosed by us we immediately briefed 
congress on what it was we were had intended to do why we did 
it and so i dont think theres any real lack of consultation in 
fact i pride myself on the fact that we have had outstanding 
consultation and ive had these leaders down here over and over 
again bipartisan and im going to continue to do that 
q the july trip mr president it was six months before 
congress found out about it 
a thats right thats right 
q why not inform the people 
a because we were working on some initiatives and in my 
judgment it was better that it be quiet and ive cited some 
examples in history particularly the china trip opening to china 
that i think was best served by the way it was done yes

tougher food and drug regulations said that while he shares some 
of the fdas concerns about heartguide the agencys action is 
premature and unfortunate 
the federal government has defaulted on its obligation to 
control misleading health claims by food manufacturers and the 
heart associations plan does represent an attempt to provide some 
reliable health information to consumers he said 
he said the fda has been trying for several years to adopt a 
regulation restricting health claims that food manufacturers can 
put on their labels 
the agency has also been criticized for moving too slowly to 
revise requirements for food labeling in general the fda held 
hearings last fall on food labeling and plans to draft a proposal 
by summer a spokesman said 
in a letter to the association wednesday the fda expressed 
concern that the heartguide program will increase consumer 
confusion and could lead to endorsement of some margarine and oil 
products that do not represent the kinds of foods that ought to 
be promoted to achieve healthy hearts 
silverglade said he shares that concern and added that the 
association may be giving out the seal a little to generously and 
that their standards were not strict enough 
for the first phase of the program more than 100 brands of 
margarine oil crackers and vegetables have been tested and 
approved they include mazola corn oil promise margarine pam 
cooking sprays melba toast and hanover frozen vegetables 
companies pay a fee up to 640000 depending on sales to 
participate in the program 
in the second phase which initially was put on hold after the 
fda letter but put back on track thursday the seal will be offered 
to other products including cereals cheese cookies pasta salad 
dressings and other foods 
the fda has no authority to stop the program but it could take 
companies to court if it finds their labels misrepresent their 
products 
one of the companies in the program said it intends to advertise 
its seal of approval despite the fda warning 
i dont think im afraid of it because i think there will be a 
resolution to the problem said bob maier chairman of california 
amp washington co a san franciscobased company that markets frozen 
vegetables i think both groups are trying to do best for the 
consumer 
he noted that other thirdparty endorsements including the good 
housekeeping seal of approval and the american dental association 
are being used now to guide consumers in other markets

the budget president bush will propose monday 
will include about 50 million to improve government statistics 
affecting most americans ranging from costofliving wage 
increases to prices of stocks in which pension funds invest 
heavily the presidents chief economic adviser said thursday 
contending that the us statistical system is among the finest 
in the world chairman michael j boskin of the council of economic 
advisers admitted it still has serious problems especially in the 
rapidly changing areas where accuracy is most needed 
the economic statistics are important because of their large 
impact on the economy boskin said at a news briefing on bushs 
initiative to improve economic statistics 
private orders and contracts costofliving adjustments the 
federal budget and monetary policy are all based on the economic 
information produced by the federal statistical system he added 
boskin said various government agencies are expected to report 
in about three months on how they plan to implement 25 
recommendations already made by the presidential economic policy 
councils working group to improve the system 
boskin who heads the group said the most serious problem 
facing the governments statisticsgathering operation is 
estimating quality change in many important sectors 
when we as a nation produced mostly things like steel and 
wheat output was easy to count tons of steel and bushels of 
wheat he said 
today a larger share of output is in sectors where better 
performance means quality and improved convenience he continued 
consider the impact of 24hour automatic teller machines and the 
changes in desktop and laptop computers 
as an example of the need to examine measurement problems 
boskin cited price indexes that should adjust for quality change 
when the commerce department recently introduced a new 
computer price index that only partially adjusted for quality 
change it raised real gnp gross antional product growth from 38 
to 41 percent a difference reaching 70 billion by 1988 and 
lowered the rate in inflation as measured by the gnp price 
deflator from 36 to 33 percent between 1982 and 1988 he said 
boskin also said the governments statistical system has not 
kept up with changes in the economy including airline 
deregulation which he said produced lower fares and widespread 
discounting causing passenger miles to increase by over 60 percent 
in the 1980s 
yet the price index is still heavily based on fullfare 
tickets which now account for only 10 percent of tickets he 
noted

a dynamite attack on the countrys main 
petroleum pipeline thursday caused an oil spill covering nearly two 
square miles and leaked thousands of barrels of crude into a 
mountain stream the state petroleum company ecopetrol reported 
an ecopetrol communique did not say who was responsible for the 
attack outside teorama but authorities believe it was almost 
certainly perpetrated by leftist guerrillas belonging to the 
national liberation army known as the eln 
the eln has claimed responsibility for 115 attacks against 
colombian petroleum facilities since 1986 in an effort to force the 
government to nationalize the industry 
the group called a halt to the attacks in the second half of 
1989 but renewed them this year to protest a hike in the domestic 
price of gasoline 
the ecopetrol communique said the blast near teorama would have 
serious ecological consequences because thousands of barrels of 
spilled crude flowed into a pristine stream that feeds the 
catatumbo river 
teorama is 260 miles north of the capital bogota 
thursdays attack was the third this year against the pipeline 
running from the cano limon oil field on the border with venezuela 
to the caribbean port of covenas near cartegena 
ecopetrol said it was stopping the flow of crude through the 
pipeline until a team could repair it

q mr president as you analyze the outcome today and the vote 
itself how much of it was a vote on the chinese student issue and 
how much of it do you perceive to be a vote on your overall 
approach to china 
a i or on the political side i dont know i dont know how 
you measure it but i do think this as i had an opportunity to 
discuss it with individuals and as our team did i think there was 
much more understanding of the merits than had been granted 
originally and i think wed all agree everybody here that a 
couple of weeks ago there was just it just was kind of written 
off as and getting pounded on the merits as well as on the 
politics 
so the consultations and the discussions to try to get support 
for this i think have increased understanding even by those that 
didnt vote for me at least i think they understand that there 
were some merits to what i was trying to do they may have 
disagreed with it some may have agreed with what is the thrust of 
some of these questions on the secrecy question some may have 
felt that legislation is better than the you know executive 
branch authority doing it but i think i was given the benefit of 
the doubt by some in terms of knowledge of the importance of the 
relationship with china 
i think i hopefully dissuaded some in terms of some of the 
propaganda on the other side that i didnt care about human rights 
so it was an interesting development here taking a project that 
many had considered extraordinarily difficult and then seeing it 
resolve itself in this way but there is no you know there is no 
intention on my part to crow about it i mean it was a very close 
vote and it worked out better than many had felt it would and now 
weve got to go forward tomorrow its something else i am not 
going to live there on this thing forever 
q if i may follow was there not a broader issue in regard to 
china policy here than just the situation with the students 
a what i dont want to i am not sure i 
q was this not a congressional mandate or a senate mandate on 
the way you handled the overall china policy more than just the 
student issue 
a well some of it was some of it was political some of it 
was wed already accomplished by executive order what the pelosi 
bill was going to do so some of it was a feeling that maybe itd 
be better to lock it in on legislation some of it was they wanted 
to make a statement theres a lot of you have to just ask those 
who voted as they did yeah 
q mr president a lot of the emotion over your china policy 
had to do with the famous scowcroft toast on videotape it angered 
a lot of people to see him toasting people responsible for the 
tiananmen square massacre would you say that at least that part of 
it was a mistake that it 
a no because when you go to china that is i dont know of 
anybody thats been there that doesnt engage in that activity and 
if you read the full context of what was said i think it was a 
very unfair shot but i agree with you some people used that as 
something that was outrageous but they ought to go over to china 
and just understand how it works and 
q if it had not been televised do you think the public 
reaction if people had only known that he went over there and 
that he had had talks do you think the public reaction would have 
been different than it was when they saw him toasting on television 
a no i think the people that are outraged by it and expressed 
themselves were concerned about my whole approach to it i think 
but i cant say that that i think that it may have affected one 
or two i dont really know the answer to that one michael did i 
answer or did you get the question inaudible crosstalk 
a okay no i

president bush praised mikhail s gorbachev on 
thursday as the best hope for the united states in the soviet 
union and declined to fault him for using force to restore order in 
the soviet republic of azerbaijan 
the president also hailed a senate victory on his china policy 
calling it a good signal for the political fights ahead 
bush gave a new strong endorsement to the embattled soviet 
president telling a luncheon audience of 75 newspaper executives 
i think we have a lot at stake in continuing to deal with this 
man 
i want very much for him to succeed bush said and i 
dont think anyone is faulting him for the difficulties that he has 
encountered in azerbaijan 
the president used the luncheon to unveil his latest antidrug 
strategy but he also fielded questions on a range of other 
subjects then after the senate vote upholding his veto of a bill 
to prohibit the deportation of chinese students bush bounded to 
the white house briefing room to applaud the vote 
surprised you didnt it he said of the senate outcome 
he called the vote a good signal for the political fights that 
may lie ahead 
asked whether the victory with which he had started the year 
would transfer to other issues bush said 
im not in a mode of talking about momentum or something of 
that nature i do think because of the way it worked out its 
going to be helpful in reaching accommodation in the senate and in 
the house on certain of our objectives 
i dont come in here with any sense of gloating he said 
excuse me if the adrenalin flew he said as he conducted the 
days second halfhour news conference at which he also announced 
a 1 billion aid package for panama 
bush was asked at the session with newspaper executives about 
gorbachevs use of military force in an effort to put down the 
separatist rebellion in azerbaijan you see blockades of your 
ports and the man has to respond bush said 
im not encouraging that course because we would like to see 
peaceful change wherever possible overall he said gorbachev 
has done a remarkable job 
asked about contentions of some analysts that gorbachevs 
political position was precarious bush said he wouldnt 
speculate on the totality of survival 
its not for some president of the united states to start 
saying who he thinks ought to be in that job bush continued 
but as i look around i think mr gorbachev is really the best 
hope for what our interests are 
we want to see peaceful change continue we want to see 
democratization of eastern europe we want to see openness bring 
about marketforce economies inside the soviet union and all of 
these things are in our interest 
on other subjects bush said at either the session with 
newspaper executives or the later news conference in the briefing 
room 
he did not wish to point a finger at any party for the 
apparent impasse in middle east peace talks and promised that the 
united states would continue to be a catalyst in trying to 
bring israel the palestinians and egypt to the bargaining table 
there have been some very ugly incidents among recent 
bombings and racial violence but id like to think there is not 
a rising tide 
he will tell americans in his state of the union address next 
wednesday that he has a feeling that the country is going to be 
in pretty good shape 
a strong and vigorous economy is the best answer for 
helping communities affected by military base closings to recover 
he plans to send a list of proposed base closings to congress on 
monday when he submits his fiscal 1991 budget bush said that in 
the past private business had often moved in and provided jobs in 
areas that lost government installations 
his position has not changed on gun control i think the 
thing is to enforce the laws on the books 
while the matter is in the courts he would not comment on 
whether he would consider pardons for former reagan white house 
aides oliver north or john poindexter north is appealing his 
convictions and poindexter is awaiting trial 
he hopes to be able to do more in the coming months to combat 
the problem of homelessness saying that when you go upstairs and 
look out that window you see some pretty heartrending sights he 
was referring to homeless people who sleep on heating grates within 
sight of the white house

q back to panama sir the election last may is the one that 
never really resulted in a full count because of general noriega 
yet thats the same election on which the endara government is 
basing its legitimacy is it time sir for another election in 
panama 
a well i think that fortunately the endara has been endorsed 
by the electoral commission they kind of were a little diverted 
from their normal course of business by mr noriega a while back 
but i think thats a matter for the panamanians to decide i think 
it would be a little bit outrageous for us to come charging in and 
tell them when they ought to have an election way in the back 
q but what is your opinion 
a youre not way in the back youre in the middle huh 
q what is your opinion on this 
a well im not going to have an opinion i want this to be the 
panamanian system the emphasis from now on ought to be panamas 
democracy panama determination let panama figure out and then 
well try to help or if they ask for criticism or suggestions 
fine but i dont want to be appearing that we are trying to to 
run the new democracy in panama from up here that would the worst 
thing we could do way in the middle and in the back 
q on another topic several key democratic senators say they no 
longer they dont believe that president cristiani has control of 
the military any longer what is your response to that they are 
also drafting legislation which would kill future military aid do 
you think you will be as successful in defeating that passage as 
you were today 
a i hope so because cristiani is trying hard and i think that 
there is some evidence that he doesnt control all his military 
the very fact he is trying to bring some to justice who at least 
have been accused of wrongdoing demonstrates that but the man was 
elected certifiably free elections he is trying very hard he has 
taken some extraordinarily courageous and tough steps and he has my 
full support jessica and then ellen these three in this triangle 
here and then im going jessica you lead off 
q my question is about mexico and venezuela and other countries 
in south america that have been offended by the invasion in panama 
a yes 
q i wonder if could you have spoken with their leaders and 
used some of your personal diplomacy to convince them that you 
didnt intend any offense and wont be invading any other countries 
any time soon laughter

state and local governments in the form of block grants for law 
enforcement drug treatment and antidrug education programs 
five areas are designated as highintensity drugtrafficking

president bush on thursday announced he will 
offer an aid package of more than 1 billion to help panama recover 
from the us military invasion and achieve as close to instant 
relief as we can expect 
the economic challenges that panama faces are great but we 
will work with the people to build a prosperous democratic 
nation bush told a news conference 
his package much of which needs congressional approval 
includes 
42 million in humanitarian assistance for housing emergency 
public works small business rehabilitation for looting victims and 
technical assistance to the government 
400 million in export import bank guarantees to finance sales 
of american products to panama 
15 million in agency for international development lending to 
private sector borrowers 
50 million in overseas private investment corporation programs 
to support us private investment in panama 
30 million in agriculture department programs 
28 million to restore panamas suspended sugar quota for 1989 
and 1990 
another 500 million would go to balance of payment support 
public investment economic restructuring and development needed in 
the wake of the invasion and two years of economic starvation due 
to us economic sanctions against the regime of gen manuel 
antonio noriega 
that sum will include 150 million toward helping panama pay its 
foreign debt of more than 500 million officials said 
that 500 million needs congressional approval as a supplemental 
appropriation while the other monies will come from reprogramming 
of existing funds they said 
bush said foreign aid would have to be cut from other countries 
but did not specify which ones deputy secretary of state lawrence 
eagleburger told reporters bush had not made that decision yet 
the package will go toward repairing damages estimated at up to 
2 billion stemming from the dec 20 invasion 
these programs will give as close to instant relief as we can 
expect here bush told reporters in a hastily called news 
conference where he also claimed victory in the senate vote 
upholding his veto of chinesestudents legislation 
bush said he called the usinstalled president of panama 
guillermo endara on thursday morning to assure him of our 
continued support of his efforts to establish democracy in panama 
part of this effort involves the establishment of a healthy 
economy he said 
vice president dan quayle who visits panama this weekend will 
review details of the plan with endara bush said 
were going to work closely with the congress on this package 
to ensure its prompt implementation bush said 
he predicted a shortrun vastly improved economic situation 
bush also said he told endara that if he has further needs for 
aid please let me know but that endara seemed pleased with the 
1 billion package bush added i wouldnt say this is the end of 
the road in terms of what we can do to help them 
but endara said in panama that the proposed 1 billion package 
was about half what his government had requested 
endara said in a statement that the aid would help create jobs 
and revitalize the international banking system which was once the 
backbone of panamas economy but he also said the government would 
require a substantial reduction of its payroll 
bush also did not offer any compensation for the families of 202 
civilians killed in the fighting which the panamanians have 
insisted upon 
in the senate leading members of the foreign relations 
committee including chairman claiborne pell dri and 
republican richard lugar of indiana indicated they generally 
backed aid to panama i applaud that effort said pell 
several liberal democrats however were more cautious and 
expressed concern that noriega associates would benefit my 
concern is that we are changing the name changing the uniform but 
they are still the same people said sen christopher dodd 
dconn 
the administration will encourage other nations to also help 
panama clear its debt and seek an early and generous rescheduling 
of panamas debt to foreign governments under the auspices of the 
socalled paris club of major lender nations 
the united states already has released 400 illion in panamanian 
assets frozen in the united states in earlier efforts to topple the 
noriega regime 
the program if approved would make panama one of the largest 
per capita aid recipients in the world 
panama which has 22 million residents is behind on its 
foreign loan repayments owing 534 million 
bush also said that it should be up to the panamanian people to 
decide whether to have a new election instead of accepting endara 
a candidate in last years election who was installed when noriega 
fled in the face of the us invasion 
i dont want to be appearing that we are trying to run the new 
democracy in panama from up here that would be the worst thing we 
could do bush said 
asked whether other latin governments upset about the panama 
operation should be worried about future invasions he quipped 
i havent given them my invasion list 
but he said that he believes the latin nations upset over the 
invasion now understand the us position especially given the 
us history in the region bush said anytime you undertake an 
engagement like i authorized youve got to assess what the 
downside is because there is a history

stop 
if weather permits the plane will refuel again friday at eglin 
air force base in florida before returning to the space center at 
cape canaveral 
one extra refueling stop was added to each day of the trip from

during the san antonio stop cool air will be blown on the 
shuttle to keep the cargo within specified temperature ranges she 
said 
columbia the oldest shuttle landed at this mojave desert

a well i havent given them my invasion list laughter 
but i have i have no but seriously its a very important 
question diplomatically its a good question and i i first 
place as of today because of whats happened since the fighting 
began things are better some of it may be just that time heals 
secondly i think that they have been informed some by me 
mail phone calls when these actions took place and by many other 
our state department and our representatives as to what our 
intention was what the cause was what were doing theyve seen a 
lot of forces come out now which i think is helpful there is a 
history and any time you undertake an engagement like i 
authorized youve got to assess what the downside is because of 
the history 
but jessica i am i am pleased with where we are now and i 
have not engaged in the last week or so in a lot of diplomatic 
activity with my friends but ive sent enough communications that 
i think they know what my heartbeat is on this and i think they i 
hope now when they saw what happened with the panamanian people 
that they made profound impression on them and theyve seen endara 
go forward and theyve seen the stamp of approval given to that 
his democracy and they see that now as of today that were 
determined to help not just with rhetoric but with the means of 
recovery 
so things are better and i think in given the action that i 
authorized in pretty good shape im not suggesting i have no 
diplomacy ahead yeah 
q yes mr president a surprise victory to start the year 
will this transfer to other issues and is this what someone once 
called the big mo momentum starting off 1990 laughter 
a hey listen i learned a lesson not to talk about that and 
i learned it the hard way took it right on the chin and im 
coming in here in a spirit of cooperation and excuse me if the 
adrenalin flew in one or two of the questions because you know 
things didnt look too bright just a little while back 
but no theres no point in this is too serious a business 
especially as it relates to this china policy and so im not in 
a mode of talking about momentum or something of that nature i do 
think because of the way it worked out its going to be helpful in 
reaching accommodation in the senate and in the house on certain of 
our objectives and by that i mean im offer out that hand of 
cooperation 
but it is a twoway street i simply cannot accept legislation 
that is that is opposed to principles i believe in so i dont 
know where it will fall out but there isnt i promise you i 
dont come in here with some sense of gloating or anything of that 
nature at all it was too tough a vote for a lot of my friends on 
both sides of the aisle yeah ellen last one 
q mr president in announcing 1 billion for panama thats an 
awful lot of money so who what countries are going to get less 
money as a result of our generosity to panama 
a well there will be offsets and we will at the appropriate 
time which is fairly soon tell the congress where we think those 
offsets should come from but let me reiterate my my 
philosophical approval for the bob dole position which is to give 
the president more flexibility on this concept of earmark ive 
ive ive ive boycotted the back benches so were going to 
end with this one right here 
q mr president do you agree with the naacp and other 
organizations that there is a rising tide of racism in this 
country 
a i had a long talk with some of the executives of the naacp 
the other day and they expressed to me their concerns and i share 
their concerns but whether it i like to think that there isnt a 
rising tide i think that there are some very ugly incidents and 
if i can use this platform the white house to speak out against 
that bigotry and against that ugliness perhaps it will help i 
dont but i will tell you that several of those leaders felt that 
there was a growing pattern of racism and as you you know your 
question said a rising tide i dont know that i agree with it 
but i do agree there are some very ugly incidents lately and we 
all ought to do what we can to make clear that is not the american 
way 
thank you i really do have to go thank you all you guys have 
been stiffed but ill get you next time i promise

an agriculture department scientist said 
thursday the 1989 corn crop probably escaped high levels of 
contamination by aflatoxin a natural cancercausing chemical that 
plagued growers in 1988 
microbiologist donald t wicklow of the departments 
agricultural research service said the weather conditions necessary 
for unusually high aflatoxin levels generally were not present on a 
national scale last year he said none has been reported since last 
falls harvest 
wicklow works for the agencys northern regional research center 
in peoria ill his comments were released here by the agency 
aflatoxin is a poisonous chemical produced by two soil fungi 
aspergillus flavus and a parasiticus wicklow said a flavus has 
been found most commonly in peanuts and corn especially in hot 
dry weather as in 1988 
corn will not necessarily be contaminated simply because it was 
grown in a field that previously produced aflatoxintainted corn 
wicklow said neither will it pick up aflatoxin from being stored 
in bins that previously held tainted corn

five west germans have been accused 
of exporting components to pakistan that could be used to make 
nuclear weapons and of shipping reactor material to south africa 
and india officials said thursday 
the case is the worst export scandal to hit west germany since 
accusations last year that west german companies helped build an 
alleged chemical weapons plant outside tripoli libya 
the five suspects are accused of violating west germanys laws 
for the control of war weapons and its export regulations said a 
statement by the prosecutors office in hanau near frankfurt 
according to the statement the suspects are rudolf ortmayer 
former head of the neue technologie gmbh company of gelnhausen a 
former business partner physicist peter finke chemist heinrich 
weichselgartner and two unidentified businessmen 
from 198188 ortmayer and finke allegedly sent pakistan 
equipment and components for producing nuclear fuel rods without 
obtaining the necessary permit the statement said 
the prosecutors also said the two unidentified men and 
weichselgartner are suspected of illegally shipping tritium gas to 
pakistan in 198586 as well as shipments of equipment for 
collecting and purifying the gas 
tritium can be used in the manufacture of nuclear weapons 
ortmayer was additionally accused of exporting to india material 
for two atomic reactors and a test device for measuring fuel rods 
to south africa in both cases without the necessary permits said 
the statement 
both ortmayer and finke were additionally charged with failing 
to pay about 5 million marks 29 million in taxes the statement 
said 
the statement said arrest warrants for the suspects were 
carried out but it did not say if all five were in custody 
the investigation was launched in november 1987 and the case 
has been the subject of special parliamentary hearings 
the suspects could face up to 18 years in prison if convicted 
the case follows last years scandal triggered by us 
accusations that west german firms helped build an alleged poison 
gas plant in libya the west german government at first rejected 
the reports but later german prosecutors launched an investigation 
that is continuing 
west germany embarrassed by the libya scandal toughened up its 
export laws last year and vowed to crack down on violators

raising unemployment taxes now would prevent 
painful increases during a possible recession sponsors said 
thursday as they introduced legislation to raise an extra 26 
billion a year from those taxes by 1993 
the plan by three house democrats comes at a time when many 
members of congress are discussing a cut in the social security 
payroll tax which would provide millions of workers with a tax cut 
one of the sponsors rep tom downey of new york chairman of 
the ways and means subcommittee on human resources said the two 
issues should not be linked because social security funds are 
flushed at the current time and unemployment accounts are not 
he said workers have historically supported unemployment programs 
because they stand to benefit from them 
the aflcio supports the plan said a spokeswoman 
downey noting president bushs nonewtaxes campaign pledge 
defended the measure as merely an expansion of an old tax that has 
not kept pace with increases in the amount of benefits paid to 
unemployed americans 
the white house has not reviewed the legislation or taken a 
stand said spokesman stephen hart 
the measure would make other changes in unemployment 
compensation law such as allowing exmilitary personnel to receive 
benefits for 26 weeks just like civilians out of work instead of 
the 13 weeks now permitted 
downey said there is now an 11 billion shortfall in federal 
unemployment compensation accounts including the fund used for 
making loans to states so they can make payments 
without some change nearly half the states would run out of 
funds to pay benefits if another recession hits he predicted 
we can pay additional unemployment taxes now during good 
economic times or we can pay more unemployment taxes later when we 
have another recession downey said 
under current law the federal government taxes employers 08 
percent on the first 7000 paid to each employee businesses also 
pay state unemployment taxes on top of that 
though businesses write checks to the government many 
economists believe workers shoulder the actual burden through 
smaller wage increases 
downeys measure would increase the federal wage ceiling to 
10000 by 1000 a year for the next three years 
the current 08 percent tax rate includes a 02 percent surtax 
that is set to expire at the end of 1990 downeys measure would 
allow the surtax to expire 
states must set their taxable wage base at least as high as the 
federal ceiling an increase in the federal ceiling to 10000 
would cause 3000 increases in 17 states and smaller increases in 
another 18 states 
the other sponsors are reps sander levin of michigan and don 
pease of ohio

fifth captive thursday since announcing defeat by the government 
last week and said the man was its last kidnapping victim 
juan camilo pelaez a wealthy merchant was found chained to a 
window grating of a house in residential section of medellin two 
radio networks reported he was abducted jan 10 in medellin hub 
of colombias cocaine trade 
mr pelaez is the last of our hostages said a statement 
from the cartel which declared a week ago that the government 
antidrug campaign had won and it would end a terror blitz of 
bombings kidnap and murder 
caracol radio said the traffickers gave pelaez the document and 
told him to carry it to the press 
authorities said 15 people abducted in the last two months 
remained in the hands of the traffickers the cartel denied it held 
other hostages in antioquia state which includes medellin but 
said it knew who did 
next week we will publicly denounce the gang that has the 
rest of the kidnapping victims in its power in our state the 
statement said it accused police of abducting and massacring 12 
people including 10 hired assassins last week in gomez plata a 
town 55 miles north of medellin 
last sunday authorities announced the discovery of 12 
bulletriddled bodies at a tourist ranch near gomez plata 
antioquia state police identified the victims as two managers of 
the ranch and 10 medellin youths who may have belonged to a gang of 
hired killers the police said they were investigating the motive 
the medellin cartel leaders said in the statement they would 
provide evidence and testimony to prove members of the bogota 
police force were responsible if the government gave guarantees in 
return they did not specify the guarantees 
thursdays message carried the slogan of the extraditables a 
name the medellin traffickers adopted when they became subject to 
extradition to the united states the slogan is we prefer a tomb 
in colombia to a jail cell in the united states 
since president virgilio barcos government declared war on the 
traffickers in midaugust following the slaying of a popular 
presidential candidate bombings and other attacks attributed to 
them have taken 209 lives 
the cartel said in its capitulation last week it would free all 
hostages and also would abandon the cocaine trade in return for 
constitutional and legal guarantees which officials 
interpreted to mean an end to extradition 
barco said he would wait until the traffickers fulfilled their 
promises before responding to their requests 
his government has extradited 13 colombians wanted on drug 
charges in the united states

president bush announced thursday that he will 
nominate former new york state legislator john r dunne to the top 
civil rights job in the justice department a post that has been 
vacant for more than a year 
bushs first choice for the job william lucas failed to win 
senate confirmation last year 
the job has been vacant since december 1988 when william 
bradford reynolds stepped down as assistant attorney general for 
civil rights reynolds provoked controversy by opposing 
affirmativeaction programs that involved racial preferences 
dunne who will turn 60 on sunday has a sparse background on 
civil rights a former chairman of the new york state senate 
judiciary committee he is a graduate of georgetown university and 
yale law school 
colleen oconnor a spokeswoman for the american civil liberties 
union said the new york chapter had for years studied dunnes 
record on civil rights and found it lacking 
i think its fair to say these questions are going to come 
up when dunne is examined by the senate judiciary committee she 
said because he has not built a solid record that i think will 
please the civil rights community 
benjamin hooks executive director of the national association 
for the advancement of colored people said he did not know enough 
about dunne to have formed an opinion 
we wait to see what this mans record is and we will be 
looking at it hooks said 
after initial reports in november that dunne was in line for the 
civil rights post he resigned from the allmale garden city golf 
club which he had belonged to for 32 years his hometown is garden 
city ny 
during most of his 24 years as a state legislator a parttime 
post dunne lived in albany at the fort orange club which until 
1988 barred women 
the white house announced the dunne nomination shortly after 
bush finished a news conference at which he was asked whether he 
agrees with naacp leaders that there is a rising tide of racism 
in the country 
bush said he does not view it as a rising tide but said 
there are some very ugly incidents bush said he shares the 
concerns of the civil rights leaders about the recent wave of 
racial bombings and threats in the south 
the lucas nomination was scuttled by intensive lobbying by civil 
rights groups troubled by lucass lack of legal experience and his 
views that supreme court rulings had not eroded civil rights 
protections under the law the senate judiciary committee rejected 
his nomination aug 1 
lucas a onetime michigan sheriff and wayne county executive is 
now a public liaison official at the justice department a post 
that did not require confirmation 
dunne in an interview with the associated press on wednesday 
said he had reviewed videotapes of the judiciary committees 
grilling of lucas to prepare for his own hearings 
i looked at that video again over the weekend and it was a 
very tough spot they put him in said dunne 
its an altogether different ballgame in washington gosh 
they play for keeps said dunne 
he acknowledged i havent had as much experience as im sure 
many civil rights activists perhaps would like to see 
but dunne said he has been sufficiently involved in civil rights 
to have an understanding and a sensitivity and caring about the 
issue 
dunne has the backing of democratic rep charles rangel an old 
friend and the most powerful black member of new yorks 
congressional delegation dunne is white 
if the president has to pick a republican he couldnt pick a 
more decent person than john dunne rangel said in a recent 
interview 
new york gov mario cuomo in a jan 2 letter to bush called 
dunne an honorable and conscientious public servant an able 
lawyer dedicated to the rule of law a committed family man and a 
very decent person cuomo is also a democrat 
dunne resigned his legislative seat last september after losing 
a contest for majority leader in the republicancontrolled state 
senate he is a partner in a uniondale ny law firm 
attorney general dick thornburgh a longtime friend of dunnes 
noted that dunne was called to attica state prison in 1971 by 
rioting prisoners to help negotiate the end of a stalemate with 
state authorities 
dunne has devoted most of his professional life as a public 
servant dedicated to matters relating to the administration of 
justice including the rights of institutionalized persons and 
increased access by the public to legal services thornburgh said

barbara bush saying she wants to keep the 
white house as the first house in the land launched a drive 
thursday to raise a 25 million endowment fund for the upkeep and 
improvement of its famed public rooms 
ms bush announcing the membership of the new white house 
endowment fund called it truly a celebration for this 
splendid house 
throughout our history the white house has always held a 
special place in the hearts of americans even those 19th century 
miscreants who cut little pieces of the curtains as souvenirs 
mrs bush said 
the aim is to create an endowment to ensure the best care and 
upkeep of all of its splendid public rooms mrs bush said 
the fundraising effort will be spearheaded by dorothy m craig 
of midland texas a friend from the bushes days in the oil 
business 
the white house endowment fund will be a subsidiary of the white 
house historical association that jacqueline kennedy helped create 
back in the 1960s to produce a guide book and educational materials 
about the mansion where every president except george washington 
has lived 
the historical association includes such prominent washington 
figures as lawyer clark clifford and j carter brown director of 
the national gallery of art they were among three dozen people who 
joined mrs bush in the state dining room to announce the 
fundraising drive 
as clark clifford told me jackie kennedy said the white house 
should be the first house in the land and thats what were hoping 
to keep it mrs bush told reporters 
the move comes 12 years after an attempt during the carter 
administration to raise a 20 million preservation fund failed 
over the years money has been raised privately from benefactors 
to buy furniture paintings and other appointments for the white 
house but it has never had an endowment just this week the white 
house announced installation of a new rug drapes and other 
furnishings in the oval office at a cost of 62000 
mrs craig whose husband earle m craig jr is a retired 
oilman said she is hoping to raise the 25 million within 2 to 
3 years 
mrs craig has been part of past preservation efforts at the 
white house and also helped raised about 200000 for refurbishing 
of the vice presidential mansion when the bushes lived there she 
also played a role in raising funds for the new oval office rug 
some of my friends at home think im going to redecorate the 
white house that is not the case she told reporters im 
simply a fundraiser 
we are starting from scratch she said 
nancy reagan helped win formal museum status for the white 
houses public rooms including the state dining room the east 
room the green room and the blue room which tens of thousands of 
visitors troop through each year

the night he was arrested on a cocaine 
possession charge mayor marion s barry jr made repeated sexual 
advances to the woman reported to have helped the fbi lure him to 
the room law enforcement sources said thursday 
barry who the fbi says was videotaped buying and smoking crack 
cocaine kissed and touched rasheeda moore during his visit to her 
hotel room the law enforcement sources said 
she rebuffed him said the sources who spoke on condition of 
anonymity 
according to an fbi affidavit filed in connection with the 
misdemeanor drug possession charge agents used a surveillance 
camera located in an adjacent room during barrys 45minute visit 
to ms moores room at the hotel thursday night 
during the visit the mayor spoke in a decisive voice while 
conducting city business on the telephone said one source 
the account of sexual advances was first published thursday in 
the washington post 
barry on monday checked into a rehabilitation center in west 
palm beach fla after turning over his duties to city 
administrator carol thompson 
in developments thursday 
prosecutors delayed the appearance of two of barrys 
bodyguards before a grand jury a scheduling conflict with federal 
prosecutors investigating barrys ties to a convicted drug dealer 
forced the postponement a source familiar with the probe said 
four members of the mayors security detail who are assigned to 
the mayor on a roundtheclock basis have been subpoenaed to 
testify about whether they have knowledge of any barry drug use 
said law enforcement and city government sources 
business labor and community leaders were meeting thursday 
night to discuss plans to encourage jesse jackson to become a 
candidate in the november mayoralty election meanwhile however 
jackson complained in comments in the new york times that the 
mayors position had zero political leverage 
former comedian dick gregory who spent several days 
immediately following barrys arrest at the mayors residence said 
in las vegas that barrys closest friends were tickled to death 
to see that he was seeking help however gregory said at a las 
vegas meeting that he was angry that the federal government has 
spent so much time and effort in arresting the mayor 
bush administration drug policy coordinator william j bennett 
said barrys arrest might be one of these watershed kind of 
events that changes peoples attitudes and makes people really 
realize they have to do something 
law enforcement and other sources say ms moore 38 had a 
longstanding romantic relationship with the mayor but began 
cooperating with the fbis investigation several weeks ago 
following her arrest on a drunken driving charge near her home in 
burbank calif 
she had been told by the fbi not to have sexual relations with 
barry during thursday nights sting operation law enforcement 
sources said she also was instructed not to smoke any crack or to 
make any suggestion about using illegal drugs to avoid any 
subsequent defense claim of entrapment the sources said 
barry himself raised the subject of drugs and purchased a small 
quantity of crack cocaine from an fbi undercover agent posing as a 
friend of ms moore according to a court affidavit and sources 
ms moore began cooperating with the fbi after her arrest in 
north hollywood calif jan 1 the fbi which had lodged a 
material witness warrant was put in touch with her 
authorities in california said 
she agreed to cooperate in the sting operation after being 
confronted with grand jury testimony she gave last spring during 
which she denied using cocaine with the mayor sources said 
they said she told investigators that she and barry used drugs 
on repeated occasions over a number of years including a march 
1988 weekend trip to the virgin islands 
her story corroborates testimony by convicted drug dealer 
charles lewis who said he used cocaine with barry during the 
virgin islands trip and at a downtown hotel in the nations capital 
law enforcement sources say prosecutors are trying to build a 
perjury case against the mayor who denied in sworn grand jury 
testimony that he ever used illegal drugs 
the grand jury has called additional witnesses including 
members of the mayors security detail 
a native of washington ms moore graduated from modeling school 
here and has posed in the past for such national magazines as 
essence she was employed by the city government as a social worker 
in 1987 and 1988 according to a statement this week by the mayors 
office

a minority party in east germanys 
communistled government resigned its three cabinet posts late 
thursday and called on other coalition partners to do likewise 
the withdrawal by the christian democratic union cdu 
effective feb 9 heightened the crisis of confidence faced by the 
communist government of premier hans modrow 
the official adn news agency also said modrow has been invited 
to visit moscow on tuesday for talks with soviet president mikhail 
s gorbachev it said the trip would be a working visit but 
gave no details 
the government was forced earlier thursday to agree to major 
concessions to encourage free enterprise because of growing 
pressure for market reforms and reunification with west germany 
cdu leader lothar de maiziere said the three cdu ministers would 
serve in the 27member cabinet until feb 9 effectively setting a 
deadline for modrow to build a new cabinet that includes 
prodemocracy opposition groups 
adn quoted de maiziere as saying his party took the step to 
make way for negotiations with new parties and groups toward 
formation of a new government and assumes other parties in the 
government will take the same steps 
communists now hold 16 ministerial posts liberal democrats 
four christian democrats three and the national democrats and 
farmers party two each 
de maiziere is a deputy premier the two other cdu cabinet 
members are construction minister gerhard baumgaertel and post 
minister klaus wolf 
the cdu threatened on jan 17 to pull out of the government to 
protest the communists tight grip on power 
the noncommunist cabinet members are all from officially 
recognized parties once aligned with the communists all have tried 
to distance themselves from a party now disgraced and stripped of 
authority 
modrow has agreed to include opposition forces in his cabinet 
until free elections are held on may 6 but the prodemocracy 
groups like new forum democratic awakening and the social 
democrats disagree among themselves how large a role they should 
take on 
the parties would also be taking on partial responsibility for 
the disastrous state of the east german economy and the uncertain 
political situation 
earlier thursday a leading politician dresden mayor wolfgang 
berghofer told his city council that german unification is 
inevitable because east germany never developed a separate national 
identity 
germany was split into communist east and capitalist west after 
adolf hitlers nazi regime was defeated in world war ii 
it is unavoidable that what belongs together will grow 
together said berghofer who quit the communist party on sunday 
the only question is in what time frame and in what manner it 
will occur 
modrow will visit bonn on feb 1314 to meet with west german 
chancellor helmut kohl to discuss the dire economic and political 
problems in east germany kohl chief of staff rudolf seiters 
announced 
on thursday economics minister christa luft told a news 
conference the government has scrapped plans to limit foreign 
ownership of joint ventures to 49 percent a concession to western 
business executives who spurned the earlier conditions 
east germany also will lift all restrictions on competition 
among private industry and crafts people effectively opening the 
national economy to free enterprise government spokesman wolfgang 
meyer announced 
the steps embracing capitalism illustrate the heightened fears 
among east german leaders that the nation is headed toward economic 
collapse 
statistics this week showed a sharp drop in production and ms 
luft confirmed that about 2000 east germans are fleeing the nation 
each day 
hundreds of thousands of east germans fled last year growing 
street protests toppled the hardline regime of erich honecker 
new communist leaders opened the berlin wall and promised free 
elections to placate the masses but the exodus west apparently has 
not been halted 
seiters said more than 42500 east germans had moved to west 
germany since jan 1 
the exodus has robbed east germany of vital labor strength and 
undermines economic recovery efforts 
communist officials tried unsuccessfully beginning last fall to 
adopt an economy combining socialism and capitalism but pressure 
for more radical change forced the communists to yield to western 
business demands 
majority foreign ownership of east german businesses will be 
allowed for any small and mediumsize firms and for any projects 
in the publics economic interest ms luft said 
ms luft suggested that the condition of public economic 
interest would be loosely defined to ensure interest among 
western investors 
she also confirmed that east germany has accepted west german 
promises of 35 billion in aid an offer initially rejected on 
the grounds that bonns demands for a freer east german market were 
unacceptable 
the conditions involved changing the east german economy such 
as competition among enterprises and favorable tax laws and other 
incentives for foreign investors

guillermo endara installed as 
president by the united states during last months invasion called 
the proposed 1 billion us aid package for panama generous 
support but said it was about half what his government had 
requested 
endara said in a statement that the aid would help create jobs 
and revitalize the international banking system which was once the 
backbone of panamas economy but he also said the government would 
require a substantial reduction of its payroll 
endara had asked for nearly 2 billion in a letter to bush two 
weeks ago saying his country required that much in assistance and 
rebuilding following the dec 20 invasion by 26500 us troops 
that ousted gen manuel antonio noriega from power 
although the amounts announced do not reach the total we 
wished the total sum constitutes a generous support and the 
quickness with which it was announced is very timely endaras 
statement said 
us officials in washington said the asssitance would include 
developmental aid loan guarantees and programs to encourage

economic reforms initiated by mikhail 
s gorbachev have had little impact so far in the soviet union and 
appear unlikely to succeed nato believes 
a nato study obtained thursday by the associated press called 
the failure evident from the decline in soviet living standards 
the report based on information up to july compared economic 
reforms in china and the soviet union economic analysts of the 
16nation north atlantic treaty organization compiled the study and 
handed it to nato foreign ministers in december 
it said the failure of the soviet leadership to press ahead 
with key measures such as price reforms and the halfhearted 
manner in which it has approached the growing fiscal and monetary 
crisis are reflected in the continuing decline of the soviet 
unions economic position 
the survival prospects for economic reforms in the soviet 
union now admitted by the leadership to be in a state of crisis 
become increasingly doubtful 
the report said no communist nation has succeeded in 
transforming a centrally planned economy to a flourishing 
freemarket system mainly because of the conflicting interests 
between demands for economic reforms and the goals of communist 
parties and the vested interests of their members 
the analysts found whenever it came to do or die in past 
reform efforts the party bureaucrats have always put their own 
interest first as reflected once again by recent events in china 
it said that from the start economic programs in the soviet 
union and china were hampered by unsuitable political 
institutions and predicted the reform drive in china would lose 
more ground the study said reform has been rechanneled toward 
areas acceptable to the new more conservative and suspicious 
leadership in beijing 
poland and hungary leaders in the moves toward democracy in 
eastern europe offered the prospect of cutting ties between the 
communist party bureaucracy and its vested interest in obsolete 
economic structures the study held adding 
gorbachevs support for these efforts in hungary and poland 
may be indicative of his own vision of reform 
the nato report said by trying to maintain the countrys 
socialist achievements economic reforms in the soviet union will 
remain piecemeal 
but piecemeal reforms to a centrally planned economy generate 
unpredictable frictions that would not arise if other economic 
variables were free to adapt to remove their sting

three defense analysts thursday urged the bush 
administration and congress to cancel or defer a dozen weapon or 
other military projects they said the united states no longer needs 
in a time of a diminishing soviet threat and budget constraints 
if we arent careful about our hardware choices today we 
wont have the funds to buy them efficiently or to spend on other 
defense needs gordon adams director of the defense budget 
project told reporters at a news conference 
adams was joined by dr william kaufmann and lawrence korb of 
the brookings institution 
the defense budget project is somewhat left of the center of the 
political spectrum brookings is closer to the center but its 
staff frequently advocates liberal positions kaufmann a retired 
professor at massachusetts institute of technology and often a 
consultant to the pentagon is coauthor of an annual report on the 
defense budget that in recent years has advocated less spending 
korb served as an assistant secretary of defense in the reagan 
administration 
the experts said buying the dozen weapons will cost 124 billion 
in current dollars from 1991 to 1995 and 342 billion by the time 
they are completed 
the defense budget that president bush will unveil monday for 
the fiscal year beginning oct 1 the 1991 year will be about 303 
billion 
among the weapons the three analysts slated for deferral are the 
amraam missile the army tactical missile the a12 advanced 
tactical aircraft the advanced tactical fighter the c17 
transport aircraft the lhx helicopter and the seawolf attack 
submarine 
the urged cancellation of the antisatellite missile the b2 
stealth bomber the railcar mobile basing of the mx missile the 
sramt tactical shortrange attack missile and the milstar 
satellite system 
a revolution in military affairs could be in the making at 
least in part because of the economic distress in the soviet union 
and the changes in the soviet leadership kaufmann said but 
one thing is clear the revolution will not progress much further 
without initiatives from and cooperation by the united states

an israeli businessman reportedly linked to 
mercenaries who trained medellin drug cartel gunmen was found dead 
at the airport here stuffed into the trunk of a car police said 
thursday 
the body of arik afek who had been interviewed recently by 
secret service agents preparing for president bushs visit to 
colombia was discovered wednesday after police received complaints 
of an offensive odor coming from a car in the miami international 
airport parking garage 
the cause of death wasnt immediately announced but was 
definitely a homicide said police spokeswoman lizette williams 
we are looking for anyone who can give us information on the 
case she said adding that detectives hadnt revealed if they 
have suspects 
the body was found in a beige buick regal but ms williams said 
she had no information on the cars ownership 
the dade county medical examiners office where the body was 
taken referred questions to the metrodade police who were 
awaiting autopsy results and declined to reveal whether the body 
had any marks or wounds 
theyre not releasing that but you realize the body was in a 
trunk for several days said ms williams she said police 
wouldnt speculate on the cause of death because of the bodys 
decomposing condition 
in washington a us official who spoke on condition on 
anonymity said afek gave several different accounts of his 
activities to secret service agents who interviewed him within the 
last two weeks 
the agents have been trying to determine if the medellin drug 
cartel has access to antiaircraft missiles or other weapons that 
could be used against president bush during his visit to colombia 
next month for a drug summit 
the secret service found out about afek through news reports of 
his activities in colombia said an administration source also 
speaking on condition of anonymity 
last year colombian authorities accused afek of helping reserve 
israeli army lt col yair klein escape from colombia amid reports 
klein was training the guards of drug lords there klein later said 
he thought he was training farmers to fight guerrillas 
in september colombian authorities issued arrest warrants for 
both klein and afek 
at the time diva rojas a spokeswoman for colombias department 
of security identified afek as a civilian who had an arms business 
in israel and flower shops in the united states miami police said 
he had a home south of the city 
the two israelis were wanted for violating laws against 
conspiring teaching and enlisting civilians in military operations 
without the approval of the defense ministry ms rojas said 
the two men were believed to have entered colombia in august 
1988 and to have left in mid1989 after reports surfaced that 
foreign mercenaries were training hit squads for the medellin and 
cali drug cartels 
reached in tel aviv on tuesday klein denied he fled colombia 
saying he left normally and showed reporters a passport stamp 
israel has refused to extradite klein saying the charges arent 
covered by extradition treaties 
israeli television claimed thursday that afek was being 
investigated by the cia which had given him a us passport in 
return for information on israeli activity in colombia

agriculture secretary clayton yeutter and epa 
chief william k reilly expressed differences thursday on the need 
to regulate pesticides found in ground water yeutter saying no 
reilly saying yes 
i dont think farmers need to be regulated in this area 
yeutter told the senate agriculture committee which is beginning 
work on the 1990 farm bill 
yeuetter who was taken to task by the committee chairman for 
alleged antienvironmentqal remarks later backtracked a bit to 
concede that some regulation is inevitable 
farmers are not deliberately damaging the environment and have 
never done so he said they are sometimes innocent victims of 
environmental degradation but they are not the culprits 
he said farmers need instead to be informed stimulated and 
encouraged to engage in sound practices 
environmental protection agency administrator reilly said at the 
same hearing that the agency is evaluating old and new pesticides 
for ground water contamination potential 
based on these and other data the agency will decide whether 
to use nationally applicable restrictions to regulate pesticides 
posing widespread national concerns he said examples would 
include allowing only licensed applicators to use the chemicals or 
imposing regional bans on use 
he said his department is developing a ground water pollution 
control strategy that would include pesticide regulations 
the proposed strategy calls for states to develop management 
plans based on local conditions and needs 
he gave as one example a proposed decision on aldicarb under 
which the pesticide could be used only if states operate pesticide 
management plans for it 
but the proposal also includes national restrictions that would 
ban use within 300 feet of wells restriction of use to qualified 
applicators and monitoring requirements 
reilly whose agency regulates pesticides but not fertilizers 
said his agency must closely coordinate with the agriculture 
department 
we understand and are sensitive to the many objectives which 
the farm bill must achieve and that environmental protection is 
only one of these reilly said 
although epa is concerned about growing ground water 
contamination by nitrate compounds from fertilizer and animal 
wastes the options available to farmers are generally limited to 
reducing use or changing basic farming practices to reduce the 
likelihood of contamination he said 
the hearing heated up briefly when committee chairman patrick 
leahy dvt rapped yeutter for remarks critical of 
environmentalists 
it is wrong to claim that environmentalists are forcing 
needless and unwanted regulation on farmers leahy said 
when leahy asked him whether he planned to end the criticism 
yeutter responded provided that it is responded to in kind by 
folks who place themselves in the category of environmental 
advocacy it takes two to tango and i expect sensible reasonable 
rational proposals to emanate from the socalled environmental 
community if there is to be an olive branch from me or anyone 
else 
when asked what he meant by socalled yeutter mentioned the 
groups who raised concerns over alar in apples and a statement 
from a particular group that indicate that group which i will not 
identify would like to eliminate the use of all agricultural 
pesticides by 1995 
the chief group involved in alar was the natural resources 
defense council 
under questioning from sen thomas a daschle dsd yeutter 
said he may have oversimplified his position on regulation 
some regulation in ground water is simply invevitable he 
said calling it secondary to what can be done outside the 
regulatory arena 
yeutters remarks thursday further irritated one environmental 
group 
we know of no environmental group involved in this area of 
policy that has made such an outrageous proposal to ban 
pesticides said maureen hinkle director of agricultural policy 
for the national audubon society secretary yeutter is escalating 
his antienvironmental rhetoric if he wants to know what 
environmental groups think about the farm bill why wont he meet 
with us to discuss the matter

the central committee of bulgarias 
ruling communist party met in a hurriedly called evening session 
thursday following demands in parliament by communist deputies that 
attacks on their party end 
the parliamentary session was due to last through friday and to 
decide on sorely needed economic reforms but was abruptly broken 
off thursday night and will not resume until feb 8 the official 
news agency bta said 
speculation spread that divisions between party reformers and 
conservatives were deepening five days before the party is to hold 
a national congress that could cast out holdovers from the todor 
zhivkov era 
zhivkov is under arrest for abuse of office during 35 years in 
power he was ousted nov 10 in the reforms that washed over 
eastern europe and was replaced by his former foreign minister 
petar mladenov 
mladenov who took over as party chief and bulgarias president 
has pledged to hold multiparty elections by may but opposition 
groups now holding talks with the communists on powersharing and a 
new election law have charged that the communists seek to keep 
control in bulgaria 
usually wellinformed sources said the policysetting central 
committee would discuss mladenovs keynote speech to the party 
congress and documents to be voted on at the congress 
although senior party ranks have been purged of zhivkovs best 
known supporters many orthodox communists in the provinces kept 
their positions of power 
conservative communists were strongly in evidence at thursdays 
session of the national assembly or parliament 
construction minister petar petrov vigorously defended himself 
against demands for his resignation by a group of citizens in the 
ecologically scarred northern town of ruse 
he won support from a majority of deputies including defense 
minister dobri dzhurov an influential figure said to have played a 
key role in zhivkovs overthrow 
dzhurov was loudly applauded as he urged a halt to attacks on 
the communist party 
bta said said the legislature decided to let him keep his job 
and to sue his slanderers 
although indirectly this gives satisfaction to many other 
leaders at all levels around the country who are not the targets 
of invective said bta 
bulgaria has also been hit the past week with labor stoppages 
bta said the legislature asked for an end to all strikes until 
june when the government plans to review salaries and revamp the 
social security system

the senate on thursday narrowly upheld 
president bushs veto of a bill protecting chinese students from 
deportation leaving his china policy intact and giving him a 
victory in the years first test of strength with the 
democraticcontrolled congress 
senators voted 6237 to override bushs veto four short of the 
twothirds necessary 
the action came a day after the house had voted overwhelming to 
reject bushs veto and followed an intense white house lobbying 
blitz that included telephone calls from bush and former president 
richard nixon 
in a televised appearance just after the vote bush said we 
will continue to urge china to respect the human rights of its 
citizens he hailed the vote as reaffirming our commitment to 
chinese students in this country as well as the goal of improving 
relations with china 
bush then invited the 37 republican senators who voted with him 
and the 25 house republicans who stood with him on wednesday to 
the white house for beer and pretzels 
haiching zhao of the independent federation of chinese students 
and scholars which represents chinese students studying in the 
united states said he was gravely disappointed by the vote 
in newton mass harvard graduate student xiaxia gong said 
how can we believe someone who has already cheated and sent 
highlevel officials to china when he said he would not 
before the senate roll call senate majority leader george 
mitchell dmaine said that while bush has voiced support for 
democratic reform in eastern europe this veto sends a contrary 
message to the millions of students and workers in china who are 
struggling for democracy in their country 
but sen bob dole rkan the minority leader said the 
congressional showdown was the equivalent of throwing out the 
first ball of the 1990 election season and was being used by 
democrats to force gop senators to cast a tough political vote 
to support the president 
its not china policy its american politics dole said 
just before the vote bush had publicly renewed his promise that 
the 40000 chinese students in the united states would be fully 
protected even without the legislation no student as long as 
im president will be sent back he said 
the 39025 house vote on wednesday prompted immediate criticism 
from the chinese foreign ministry in beijing a spokesman there 
said the house was fully revealing its antichina position and 
was risking damage to relations between the two countries 
but sen william armstrong of colorado a republican who opposed 
bush said the house put itself squarely on record in support of 
human freedom and made it clear it is not willing to be 
accomplices to repression of dissent 
sen richard lugar rind a senior foreign affairs committee 
member said the vote was clearly a general report card on 
the president and china but the narrowness of bushs win 
signaled likely continued sparring over us policy toward the 
worlds most populous country 
during the vote vice president dan quayle presided over the 
senate his spokesman dave beckwith said the gesture was to 
thank republican senators who were personally inclined to vote 
the other way for giving the president the benefit of the doubt 
senators who supported the override said it was important to 
maintain us leadership for human rights and to demonstrate 
disapproval of the chinese governments bloody crackdown on 
prodemocracy demonstrators last june 4 hundreds and perhaps 
thousands of demonstrators were killed in beijing 
beyond protecting chinese students from being sent home to face 
possible persecution sen william cohen rmaine said the bill 
represented americas symbol to a world that is struggling to 
throw off the chains of dictators 
another republican sen slade gorton of washington said that 
letting the veto stand sends the signal that they can get away 
with what they have done and retain their power and i think thats 
wrong 
but sen thad cochran rmiss said the issue is whether the 
senate will vote today to repudiate the leadership of the 
president lawmakers should instead help assure our foreign 
policy is coherent and predictable and that our president is given 
the standing to articulate that policy in his dealings as our 
spokesman with the leaders of the world he said 
bush under heavy pressure from congress imposed limited 
sanctions on china following the crackdown but has begun to lift 
them in recent months among the concessions have been white house 
permission to ship communications satellites to china and the 
sending of toplevel envoys on two secret missions to beijing 
congressional opponents have strongly criticized the moves 
saying bush was kowtowing to the aging leaders of a brutal 
regime and abandoning those who are pressing for democratic reform 
the immigration bill that was the subject of the fight was 
passed unanimously by the house and on a voice vote in the senate 
last year bush vetoed it on nov 30 
it was designed to ensure that students in the united states 
would not be forced to return home to possible political reprisals 
when their visas expire and to allow them to work while in this 
country many of the students spoke out in favor of the 
prodemocracy movement 
when bush vetoed the bill he ordered government agencies to 
adopt what he says are essentially the same safeguards the veto 
was an effort to preserve executive branch foreign policy 
prerogatives he said and to keep open the door for future student 
and cultural exchanges 
thursdays daylong debate grew intense at times at one point 
democratic sen edward kennedys voice rose as he compared bushs 
china policy to the us constructive engagement stance toward 
south africas white minority apartheid government 
youre wrong at the top of your lungs shot back sen john 
chafee rri this is a nation of a billion people the senator 
from massachusetts says put them over in the corner by 
themselves thats nonsense the president knows a good deal more 
about relations with the peoples republic of china than either of 
us

parliament on thursday passed a law 
reining in the once allpowerful security services as the result of 
a national scandal involving illegal spying by secret police on 
opposition parties 
among the scores of people being spied on were some members of 
parliament the new law spells out that covert intelligence 
gathering is allowed only when the security of the nation the 
sovereignty of the country and its constitutional order are 
endangered by secret activities 
as further supervision interior minister state secretary zoltan 
gal and justice minister kalman kulcsar were made responsible for 
intelligence operations 
the measure also changed the name of the main intelligence 
agency from the state security service to national security service 
gal said the law was meant to signal that the secret service 
organs no longer serve the state organization but have as their 
primary aim the security of the entire nation and constitutional 
order 
the bill became law by a vote of 2790 with 14 absentions 
gal told parliament in introducing the bill wednesday that 
intelligence agencies underwent little supervision in the past when 
hungary was a oneparty communist state 
he said a permanent and comprehensive bill governing the 
activities of the security services will be presented in parliament 
next month 
the political spying scandal broke on jan 5 when 
representatives of two opposition organizations handed reporters 
secret documents leaked to them by a member of the secret police 
secret police targets for spying included opposition parties and 
personalities writers and religious figures according to the 
documents 
chief public prosecutor karoly szijarto revealed wednesday the 
illegal eavesdropping was even more widespread than originally 
thought 
he told the legislature the internal security department even 
spied on the socialist party its predecessor the socialist 
workers communist party and other communist or leftist 
organizations the investigation is still under way 
interior minister istvan horvath resigned tuesday though he 
claimed to have had no knowledge of such practices he told 
legislators that in a democracy that is the custom 
hungary formally became a multiparty state oct 23 the first 
free elections here since 1948 are scheduled for march 25 
despite its assertion that it was not involved the scandal is 
believed to have hurt the chances of the socialist party at the 
polls

the nations top life insurer plans to allow terminally ill 
policyholders and those permanently confined to nursing homes to 
tap into death benefits while they are still alive providing them 
cash to cover the enormous cost of dying 
insurance experts say the move by the prudential insurance 
company of america could bring big change to the industry and 
advance new solutions to the growing crisis in longterm care 
its going to encourage other companies to follow said john 
booth vice president and chief actuary with the american council 
of life insurance lots of people have been talking about this 
kind of policy but no one has acted 
prudentials new living needs benefit program to be 
announced on friday is the first mass market plan to allow life 
insurance policyholders access to their death benefits before they 
die 
it will be available initially to current policyholders in 10 
states where regulators have already approved the program alabama 
alaska arizona colorado florida idaho kentucky montana new 
jersey and west virginia 
the insurer hopes to expand the program to 3 million 
policyholders throughout the country although in some states that 
would require changes in state law 
metropolitan life the nations secondlargest insurer is 
considering a program similar to prudentials said gerry 
goldsholle chief brokerage executive for metropolitan life 
brokerage a subsidiary that markets the companys living benefits 
policy 
it is under study he said 
under prudentials program which affects all types of life 
insurance current policyholders with death benefits of 25000 are 
automatically eligible new customers with policies of 50000 can 
also qualify there will be no additional cost 
prudential will pay nearly the face value of a policy if a 
doctor certifies the policyholder has less than six months to live 
policyholders in nursing homes for at least six months with no 
hope of leaving can also elect to receive their own death benefits 
either in a lump sum or in monthly payments 
prudential president joseph melone said the company wants to 
help policyholders facing huge medical expenses 
the world is changing in many ways he said people are 
living longer and the medical treatment that is keeping them alive 
is getting expensive these are real market needs that should be 
met 
melone said the company will assess each claim figuring in the 
amount of interest it would have made on the policy and deduct it 
from the face value of the policy 
for example the company is now looking into the case of a 
57yearold art director with terminal cancer and an insurance 
policy worth 29834 at the time of his death the new program 
would pay him 29183 
payments are made to the policyholder and can be used for any 
purpose said robert hill prudentials senior vice president and 
actuary 
hill said before the program the mans only other way of 
getting money from his policy was to cash it in for interest 
accrued in this case only 2948 
similarly a hypothetical policyholder in a nursing home with a 
policy that would pay 229340 at the time of his death could 
collect the money in 60 monthly payments of 3810 for a total of 
228600 
if the same person cashed in the policy he would receive only 
163989 
this is certainly not the total solution to catastrophic 
care said melone but if we should survive to an older age and 
run into troubles this will give us added support 
prudentials move follows years of discussion about living 
benefits prudentials canadian subsidiary experimented with a 
program last year providing advanced payment to 14 policyholders 
many of them suffering from aids 
in december the national association of insurance commissioners 
adopted guidelines for accelerated payment of benefits several 
companies already offer limited riders to insurance policies that 
provide for early payments but those types of policies cost more 
up until now people have been saying that anyone who wanted 
this benefit would have to pay up front for it said booth 
prudential is offering another way that only charges those who 
actually use the accelerated benefit this means there would not 
have to be an extra premium for the policy 
prudential still faces obstacles in some states like new york 
insurance laws must be rewritten to allow the plan there are no 
taxes on death benefits but it is uncertain whether that would 
apply to early payment of those benefits 
but the largest test will be whether prudentials new program 
brings in additional customers 
if this gives prudential new sales and hurts their 
competitors the competitors are sure to run out and do the same 
thing said booth

president bushs son neil announced thursday he 
was refusing to accept a settlement with federal thrift officials 
in the collapse of a savings and loan he served as a director 
the younger bush disclosed that the office of thrift supervision 
had proposed a socalled cease and desist order which would have 
barred him from certain practices if he were to become a thrift 
officer in the future 
bush who resigned as a director of silverado banking savings 
and loan association of denver two weeks after his father got the 
gop presidential nomination said accepting the order would wrongly 
make it appear he did something improper 
in my view a settlement agreement would leave an implication 
that i misbehaved as a director of silverado bush said in a news 
release 
as i have said in the past i have nothing to hide and i have 
done nothing wrong the release continued therefore i have 
refused to consent to any agreement with the office of thrift 
supervision and if they choose to bring action against me i will 
fight the matter in court 
bush 34 served as a director of silverado from 1985 until 
august 1988 
the collapse of silverado now operating as part of columbia 
savings the largest thrift in colorado is expected to cost 
taxpayers up to 1 billion 
karl hoyle senior deputy director of the office of thrift 
supervision said in washington that lawyers for bush had told the 
agency bush intends to contest the allegations made by thrift 
regulators 
consequently the office intends to ask an administrative law 
judge to review allegations that bush had conflicts of interest 
while serving as a director of silverado and to recommend a 
ceaseanddesist order to the director of the office m danny wall 
hoyle said the agency wouldnt seek a more severe penalty which 
would ban bush from working for a federally insured financial 
institution asked why he said the office didnt believe it had 
grounds to seek the more serious penalty which has been imposed on 
some former silverado officers 
in a related matter the federal deposit insurance corporation 
is considering whether to sue silverado officers and directors 
including bush for damages for losses to the taxpayers in the 
bailout 
the federal agency said examiners had expressed grave 
concern about silverados operations particularly its heavy 
investment in colorados ailing commercial real estate market 
they also have focused their investigation on what they said was 
an exceptionally large number of problem transactions between 
silverado insiders and borrowers 
bush who was a partner in an oil exploration firm jnb 
exploration had business deals with two of silverados major 
borrowers developers bill l walters and ken good 
on thursday bush also addressed those questions 
bill walters had a passive 625 percent limited partnership 
interest in jnb exploration bush said because i did not 
benefit directly or indirectly from any loan or transaction between 
silverado and businesses controlled by bill walters as an outside 
director i voted in 1986 with the other directors in unanimously 
approving the walters loans and transactions brought to us by 
management 
i voted because there was no conflict of interest under the 
federal banking laws and regulations or under the laws of 
colorado bush said 
good according to bush had a more active interest in the 
financing and management of jnb exploration and as a result i 
abstained on all votes concerning good the other board members 
unanimously approved the transactions with good bush said 
he said both walters and goods relationships with silverado 
as borrowers and preferred shareholders were established before he 
became a director 
their relationships with my company which began in 1983 also 
preceded my silverado board appointment bush said 
a former federal sampl examiner james moroney has alleged that 
regulators dragged their feet on silverado because of bushs 
presence on the institutions board and other political 
connections but regulators in washington have said they 
investigated moroneys allegations and found them invalid bush has 
said he never sought to use his political connections and wouldnt 
have if asked 
former silverado chairman michael r wise and former vice 
chairmen richard k vandapool and robert m lewis have agreed to 
civil penalties stemming from their relationships to silverado w 
james metz majority stockholder in silverado also accepted a 
lifetime ban on working for a federally insured financial 
institution 
russell m murray former executive vice president consented 
without admitting guilt to an order banning him from working for a 
federally insured financial institution without permission from 
regulators

the rum creek valley was quiet thursday 
after three days of confrontation as members of the united mine 
workers union stepped aside and allowed nonunion trucks to enter a 
coal processing plant 
five pickets had been arrested in the three days of battles with 
nonunion workers and federal marshals outside the rum creek coal 
sales inc plant where the union has been on strike for six months 
four company truck drivers also have been arrested 
i think the union leadership is looking at the situation 
said jesse south a chief deputy us marshal i dont know of 
any plans they may have 
the union is under federal court order to refrain from blocking 
the private road leading to the plant and limit the number of 
pickets at the site to 15 
we want to maintain the peace and try to keep the violence 
down said roger nelson a umw strike organizer if i can clear 
the men out to meet the conditions of the judges order we can 
avoid having a repeat of yesterday 
three pickets were arrested wednesday two for assaulting a 
federal officer 
we didnt have violence until yesterday when the marshals came 
down here and started shoving people around nelson said these 
people are frustrated with the way things are being handled thats 
why we had the violence 
by coincidence thursdays calm came on the 100th anniversary of 
the umws founding 
miners picketing the rum creek plant have blocked the road with 
cars and trucks on monday and tuesday company coal trucks with 
steel plates protecting their radiators plowed the vehicles out of 
the way on wednesday federal marshals had them towed away 
about two dozen miners struck rum creek in midaugust after rum 
creek hired a nonunion contractor to run its plant in southern 
west virginia before then unionized employees had worked the 
plant where coal is sorted and prepared for sale 
the umw was formed jan 25 1890 in columbus ohio by the 
merger of two rival coal miners organizations 
last year its resources were strained by a 9month strike 
tentatively settled jan 1 against the pittston coal group inc 
the tentative settlement has not yet been submitted for 
ratification by the rank and file 
umw members staged wildcat strikes last summer to show support 
for striking pittston miners at the height of that action 43000 
miners in 10 states were off their jobs 
on jan 16 in the first fatality linked to labor violence in 
the coal fields since 1985 one union member was killed and two 
others wounded in a west virginia shootout between picketing miners 
and gunmen 
the slaying was unrelated to the pittston strike or the actions 
at rum creek

cuba said thursday it temporarily suspended 
pulling its troops out of angola until it gets a satisfactory 
explanation for an attack by a usbacked force that cuba said 
killed seven of its soldiers this week 
a foreign ministry statement quoted by the cuban government 
news agency prensa latina said the unita attack last sunday also 
killed three angolan soldiers it said cuba took its action jointly 
with the angolan government 
the dispatch from havana was monitored in mexico city 
the statement said the united states was providing expert advice 
to unita forces which it called armed terrorist bands 
it said cuba will not let these bands attack cuban military 
personnel and sabotage the accords so laboriously worked out among 
cuba angola and south africa to end the angolan conflict 
in a statement issued thursday from their bush headquarters at 
jamba southeast angola the rebels said that they did not know 
cubans were guarding the position under attack they said havana 
failed to distribute information on its troop positions 
cuba called it a deliberate act of terrorism with the full 
knowledge that cuban personnel were there 
according to a cuban diplomat in luanda capital of angola who 
spoke on condition of anonymity earlier thursday only cuban 
civilians and no soldiers left the country in the previous 24 hours 
an estimated 50000 cuban troops supporting marxist angola in a 
15year civil war with the national union for the total 
independence of angola began a unmonitored withdrawal in january 
1989 under the accord signed in new york 
about half of cubas forces had been withdrawn so far per 
schedule and all were due to leave by mid1991 
in return south africa agreed to halt support for the rebels 
and grant independence to angolas southern neighbor namibia 
unita was not a party to the new york accords but pledged not to 
attack the cubans as they withdrew 
state department spokeswoman margaret tutwiler said in 
washington the administration is making inquiries of cuba to 
clarify the situation 
she said failure to continue the troop withdrawal in 
accordance with the schedule established by the accords will call 
into question the commitment of cuba and angola to the 
search for peace in southwest africa 
assistant secretary herman cohen said thursday he would try to 
speak to all sides involved in the incident in the next few days 
thursdays cuban statement said five cuban soldiers and six 
angolan soldiers also were wounded in unitas attack at a water 
purification plant in the hanha valley about 155 miles south of 
luanda and 13 angolan civilians were killed and 27 wounded 
members of the un monitoring force said earlier the attack 
killed four cubans and wounded seven 
angola has been embroiled in civil strife since it became 
independent from portugal 15 years ago with unita waging an 
effective bush war against the popular movement for the liberation 
of angola or mpla the marxist party in power 
cuba sent troops in 1976 to help angola fight the unita 
guerrillas who were backed by the united states and south africa 
cuban politburo member jorge risquet said two years ago that 
1000 cubans had died mostly from disease accidents and 
terrorist attacks rather than combat western estimates are 
that 5000 cubans died in angola and unita says the figure is 
higher 
there are 1000 soviet military advisers involved in planning 
and supervising combat operations according to western estimates 
the united states and the unita rebels have contended that 
government forces launched a major offensive a month ago to try to 
capture a strategic rebel stronghold

president bush is refusing to rule out a 
republican plan that would ultimately make the social security 
system private as the battle sharpens over a democrats bill 
slashing the retirement systems payroll tax 
bush told reporters wednesday that a plan by rep john e 
porter rill and the no 2 house republican leader newt 
gingrich of georgia to place workers retirement payments into 
private accounts has some interesting ingredients to it and is 
worthy of consideration of some study 
but he added im not prepared to endorse that 
the president cautioned that his 1991 budget proposal which he 
unveils monday will contain a different plan for addressing the 
huge social security surpluses

cocaine traffickers operating in the 
hinterlands of bolivia are loosening ties to the powerful but 
besieged colombian cartels looking upon them now as bad business 
partners antinarcotics officials say 
since late august when the colombian government declared its 
antidrug war the colombian cartels have often failed to show up 
for deals or make promised payments for wholesale purchases from 
the bolivians the officials say 
they are not paying up gen lucio anez commander of 
bolivias 1040man antinarcotics police force told in an 
interview here theyve got debts in arrears 
the bolivians are doing more refining and smuggling on their 
own anez and other officials said 
the colombian cartels traditionally have bought up most of 
bolivias often crudely processed cocaine it was shipped to cartel 
laboratories for refining into pure cocaine chlorhydrate and 
smuggled to the united states and other wealthy user countries 
bolivia a cocagrowing country supplies an estimated onethird of 
the worlds cocaine 
santa cruz a tropical city 355 miles east of la paz is a 
center for trafficking and a frequent calling point for colombian 
wholesale buyers 
with the buyers now less dependable the bolivians evidently are 
doing more refining on their own 
there is an increase in processing anez said were 
seizing more refined drug 
according to statistics prepared by the us embassy in bolivia 
2288 pounds of refined cocaine hydrochloride were seized in 1989 
compared to just 453 pounds the previous year seizures of 
lessrefined cocaine base dropped from 2950 pounds to 2013 pounds 
anez said his forces also had detected more bolivian cocaine 
moving through alternate smuggling channels 
the routes have shifted a little toward brazil and argentina 
in that order he said 
im not trying to say that theyve stopped shipping to 
colombia which remains the principal partner 
a us antinarcotics official working in bolivia who spoke on 
condition that he not be identified said his office also had 
received information that the colombians were having trouble making 
payments 
business has been disrupted he said 
he added that he was not sure the increased processing in 
bolivia was directly tied to the drug war in colombia he said it 
might be a result of increased consumption of cocaine in europe a 
market that bolivia supplies 
however he expressed the belief that the disruption in 
colombian operations clearly was stinging bolivian coca farmers 
the price for 100 pounds of coca leaf had slumped from about 85 in 
august to as low as about 20 in december he said 
the price drop gave a dramatic boost to a program to get coca 
farmers to switch to other crops in december a record 1303 acres 
of coca were voluntarily destroyed according to the us embassy 
nonetheless the total number of acres dedicated to coca farming 
increased from 84000 in 1985 to 130000 last year coca farming is 
legal in bolivia but processing it is not the coca leaf has been 
chewed somewhat like tobacco by the bolivian indians for 
centuries 
the united states is focusing more of its military police and 
economic aid on cracking down on processors it plans to help the 
bolivian government build a new base where us military and 
police trainers will be stationed in the tropical lowland region 
called the beni where scores of clandestine labs and air strips 
are operating 
the beni base would be a launching point for raids on the labs 
using 12 huey helicopters on loan from the us military

the battle of the burgers is heating up in london 
as restaurateurs lure diners with american fare and the salad days 
of rock n roll 
the hard rock cafe still appears to top the charts but four 
newcomers are hoping to unseat the progenitor of rock restaurants 
for the first time in its 18year history the hard rock with 
its wellknown tshirts and legendary lines of customers snaking 
along piccadilly is not listed in the popular good food guide 
editor tom jaine refused to say why the hard rock was omitted 
from the 1990 edition but said that generally restaurants are 
dropped after a change in ownership or chef or if patterns of 
taste change 
hard rocks chef of 13 years dermot lehane was lured away by 
sticky fingers the restaurant opened by rolling stones guitarist 
bill wyman last may 
i think a lot of american tourists are bored with queuing up 
at the hard rock and they are crazy about sticky fingers said 
manager lorraine angliss in a recent interview at the restaurant 
in kensington west london 
without a doubt our food is superior angliss said as she 
picked at a bunless hamburger explaining that she was dieting 
sticky fingers named after the rolling stones album displays 
250 pieces of wymans rock n roll memorabilia including his 
certificate of honorary citizenship of mobile ala his late 
bandmate brian jones green gretsch guitar and photos of very 
young rolling stones surrounded by psychedelic flowers and old 
covers of beat magazine 
its bills personal collection angliss said he had 
originally wanted to open a museum but he took it one step 
further wyman himself has joked that eating is boring and 
customers need additional entertainment 
the rock garden at covent garden which began as a live music 
club and helped discover stars such as the police u2 and joe 
jackson has also gone into the restaurantandmemorabilia 
business but marketing man henry weinreich bristles at comparisons 
with the hard rock 
were not borrowing a history its our history thats 
happening every day we guard it jealously he said if you 
want to see a museum go there if you want to be around young 
londoners and out of a tourist trap then come here 
the upstairs walls are lined with first contracts of those who 
made it big a 700 fee for two shows on aug 10 1977 by talking 
heads and a 100 payment to dire straits for a feb 11 1978 gig 
the promotional material asks diners not to be too uncool if 
a rock superstar sits next to them but paul lyons editor of the 
time out restaurant guide warns customers to have no illusions 
rock stars go to small french or japanese restaurants he 
said in an interview why would they want to go to restaurants 
that are pampering to the whims of a small adolescent to early20s 
market 
down the street from the rock garden is lennons opened 13 
months ago by the first wife of the late beatle john lennon 
although cynthia lennon is no longer involved with the restaurant 
its walls feature black and white photographs of the beatles and 
other rock n rollers 
the latest entrant into rock n roll dining is the rock island 
diner in the piccadilly arcade which offers imported hebrew 
national hot dogs flecked formica table tops and a live deejay 
from new orleans who plays 1950s rock 
for the older generations this place is pure nostalgia said 
operations manager catherine trant they remember going to the 
hop and for the younger generation the 50s are trendy because 
its a great era 
the english are nervous about being the first to dance or 
sing but they love it as long as theyre not the first you should 
see some of the people weve had shaking their tail fins here 
the hard rock cafe reacts with confidence to its challengers 
comparisons only make us proud said spokesman nick 
wiszowaty theyre all trying to emulate us

if ccommunists had a heaven it might look 
like bologna 
orange buses glide through a huge historic district closed to 
other traffic senior citizens take governmentsubsidized vacations 
on the riviera half the citys youngsters attend lowcost daycare 
centers 
the red disneyland as the italian press calls it has long 
been considered the showcase of communism italianstyle so when 
the government recently suggested turning city services over to 
private enterprise it left many italians in shock 
the proposal coming from bologna is in some measure 
revolutionary columnist miriam mafai wrote in the national 
newspaper la repubblica 
all previous ideas are being erased from the slate not only 
for the italian communist party but for all the left 
the proposal put forth for the northern italian city is 
considered symbolic of the new directions being pursued by the 
italys national communist party the largest in the west as it 
seeks to overcome an electoral decline and the specter of 
ccommunist failure in eastern europe 
i dont want to be reduced to a souvenir of a past era said 
bolognas 45yearold mayor renzo imbeni an energetic marxist 
with a bushy black mustache 
i want to be here when the history of tomorrow is written the 
change stems from this need 
with a population of 417000 bologna is the biggest city in the 
italian red belt a communistgoverned region that has become 
one of the countrys wealthiest areas 
after world war ii when voters turned to the party that helped 
lead the antifascist resistance bologna became italys first 
large city to elect a communist administration 
it earned national fame for its doitall governments which 
set up pharmacies in poor neighborhoods paid the rent for 
lowincome elderly citizens and offered free bus transportation 
during rush hours 
when buildings decayed in the porticolined historic district 
the government spent millions of dollars to restore them then 
moved the workingclass residents back in 
to help women work it set up a daycare system that even today 
charges the equivalent of only 65 to 150 a month for children up 
to 5 
there is a rather high level of social protection mayor 
imbeni said in an interview in the communal palace a 15thcentury 
building surrounded by bulletin boards featuring the communist 
daily newspaper lunita 
but its not written anywhere that we will be able to 
guarantee this also in the future 
he noted that the welfarestate system had deteriorated in many 
countries due to stagnant revenues an increase in the number of 
needy and a shrinking pool of young people all problems in 
bologna 
because of this the choice was made for a requalification 
and a renewal of the welfare state we have locally imbeni said 
what bologna is proposing to do is sell off its slaughterhouse 
and 21 city pharmacies and transfer such services as the cleaning 
of schools provision of student lunches and street maintenance to 
a mixed publicprivate concern it also is discussing private 
management of the hundreds of cityowned offices and apartments 
the money saved would be devoted to priority areas such as the 
increasing number of elderly and third world immigrants and the 
environment 
the plan has won praise from business executives average 
citizens and the national communist party which is italys 
secondbiggest party the main critics are rival political parties 
which charge the project is merely a maneuver to win votes in 
municipal elections this coming may 
if its real and concrete this is an interesting stunning 
new initiative an initiative that will be taken as an example by 
other city governments said gianandrea rocco di torrepadula 
head of the local industrialists association 
in comparison to other cities this one is run ok said 
marco bassi 46 who owns a newsstand in the workingclass little 
bologna neighborhood but things always go better in the private 
sector 
imbeni insists that the communists are not doing an aboutface 
people say the concept of state ownership is part of the 
communist culture he said but for the communists of bologna 
this isnt true and for the italian communists that was years 
ago 
indeed bologna and the rest of the red belt are known for 
their citizens entrepreneurial spirit illustrated by the network 
of cooperatives most linked to the communists which do 
everything from producing parmesan cheese to running restaurants 
the national communist party is hailing the bologna plan an 
example of its own new course the party has long embraced 
parliamentary democracy but has been kept out of the government for 
four decades 
in line with its new program the party has called an 
extraordinary congress for march to decide whether to become a new 
leftist umbrella group and perhaps even drop the communist name 
and hammerandsickle symbol 
while the bologna proposal was described as a revolution in 
national newspapers it will leave many city services intact 
the government refuses to privatize the daycare system and the 
vast bus network although it has abolished the free rushhour 
rides 
the lowincome elderly will still have a taxi service domestic 
helpers 32 social centers and subsidized vacations on the italian 
riviera 
the government will also continue to provide lowcost study 
vacations for teens in england and on the french riviera 
we dont want to change because theres a black spot on the 
soul of our past imbeni said we must change because we want 
to be here in the year 2000 with the name we have today or 
another i want to be here

guinea pigs for the companys theory that what you cant hear is 
perhaps more important than what you can 
the music masks subliminal suggestions inaudible messages 
supposedly perceptible only to the subconscious motivating 
employees to overcome procrastination and increase production the 
messages include i do it today and i take action now 
ive had it in for two weeks and ive seen a huge 
difference chiropractor and company president paul tuthill says 
from his office in the grand rapids suburb of wyoming the good 
people have improved immensely and the people who are marginal or 
shirkers quit 
mind communication which reported sales of 35 million in 
1989 is one of of only a few companies in the 50 million 
selfhelp tape industry two competitors also are based in 
michigan potentials unlimited inc of grand rapids and midwest 
research inc of walled lake a detroit suburb 
the industrys premise is that we can recognize information 
presented below our threshold of awareness even though the 
listener hears only soothing music or the sound of ocean waves on 
an audio cassette or sees images of nature on a video the 
subconscious mind can detect the hundreds or thousands of 
speededup underlying subliminal suggestions manufacturers say 
mind communication offers about 300 titles by direct mail 
ranging from weight loss and improving sex two of the biggest 
sellers to controlling spending habits and becoming a better 
bowler there are tapes designed for children to build selfesteem 
or stop bedwetting 
subliminals have been raising eyebrows since the 1950s when it 
was reported that by flashing eat popcorn during a movie 
theater owners prompted patrons to rush for the concession stand 
unaware they had been subliminally persuaded 
in recent years it appears millions of consumers have brushed 
aside the diabolic connotations associated with mind control and 
comparisons to big brother while they plunk down 10 to 40 for 
what manufacturers market as a shortcut for solving problems and 
breaking bad habits 
the 60minute tapes most of which provide a script of their 
messages are prominently displayed near selfhelp books in 
national bookstore chains such publishing companies as simon amp 
schuster random house and bantam books recently have devised their 
own versions 
many respected researchers accept the validity of subliminal 
perception but claim there is no proof these selfhelp tapes work 
theyre a waste of time and money said howard shevrin a 
university of michigan psychologist who has been involved in 
subliminal research for more than 30 years shevrin said even if 
there was a behavioral change in some people it would be impossible 
to trace it to the tapes 
shevrin suggests the possibility of harmful side effects in some 
people a theory with which tuthill agrees 
theoretically they could be harmful with forced prolonged 
exposure tuthill said if the message is noxious or contrary 
to what you want people have actually developed some bizarre 
symptoms 
tuthill said he has seen a smoker develop headaches and heart 
palpitations when exposed to a stopsmoking tape the symptoms 
stopped when the person stopped listening to the music tuthill 
even puts warning labels on his weight loss tapes because of 
reports from pediatricians that children inadvertently exposed to 
the tapes were losing weight 
barrie konicov owner of the 14yearold potentials unlimited 
has among his 200 titles bust enlargement and birth control if 
you create a thought that you will not get pregnant you will not 
get pregnant is one message 
a 1981 raid by the us food and drug administration forced 
konicov to soften his medical claims he stands by his tapes 1 
million to 2 million copies of which sell each year worldwide in 
such bookstore chains as b dalton waldenbooks and barnes amp noble 
look its a 10 tape he said adding that the company 
offers a moneyback guarantee nobody questions what we do 
though the field is largely unregulated the texas attorney 
generals office confirmed it is investigating claims made by 
several such companies 
the use of such tapes by retailers to cut shoplifting or by 
employers to increase production of unsuspecting employees has 
raised ethical questions tuthills biggest customers are 
retailers but he said he has turned down requests from auto 
dealers and political candidates 
while many of the companies cite selfconducted studies little 
independent research has been done in the area of selfhelp 
subliminals most of the companies point to individual testimonials 
as proof of their effectiveness 
two canadian psychology professors who have done independent 
research call the tapes a health fraud 
timothy moore of york universitys glendon college in toronto 
said some of the tapes he has studied apparently contain no hidden 
message at all 
philip merikle of the university of waterloo in ontario said an 
analysis of tapes made by several companies found there is no 
identifiable signal on them that could penetrate the subconscious 
he likened the amazing success stories to placebos 
weve known for hundreds of years that effective treatments 
are ones that people believe are going to work he said but 
subliminal tapes he concluded are clearly health fraud 
its not inconceivable that 20 to 30 percent of these people 
could report real improvement but not for the reasons used by the 
manufacturers he said but if 25 percent of the people who 
listen to these tapes stop smoking thats great thats also the 
irony of it

president bush is dealing with the reconvened 
democratic congress from a position some of his predecessors would 
have used to get votes or get even it doesnt seem to work that 
way for bush 
lyndon b johnson twisted congressional arms to gain support for 
his proposals and called it reasoning together ronald reagan said 
that if congress didnt see the light his way he would make them 
feel the heat 
their hardball lobbyists offered political rewards threatened 
punishments using the popularity of their presidents and warning 
that straying members might pay at the polls 
bush opens the 1990 campaign year with job approval ratings that 
surpass the firstyear standing of those predecessors and that 
havent been matched since john f kennedy but so far at least 
his personal popularity has not been convertible into lobbying 
clout in congress 
bush has the poll numbers but he doesnt have the coattails 
reagan showed in his first presidential election reagan had 
grounds to claim a mandate for major change in government and he 
had a conservative movement behind it that gave his lieutenants a 
network that could apply pressure from home districts on wavering 
congressmen as the administration built its coalition of 
republicans and conservative democrats in the house 
reagan also had the most saleable of issues in his first year 
the income tax cut that had been a centerpiece of his campaign 
enacting it and pruning down the size and power of government were 
his mandate 
bush was elected to carry on to make it all work despite giant 
budget deficits left in part because taxes were indeed cut but 
government shrank little if at all under reagan 
bush has a leftover tax cut to push a capital gains reduction 
that is likely to be passed this year but he also is confronted 
with the risk of a runaway toward the social security tax cut 
proposed by sen daniel patrick moynihan dny 
his state of the union address on wednesday night is likely to 
restate familiar proposals and priorities rather than seek new 
ones and to be coupled with a renewed call for bipartisanship 
with neither the money nor the inclination to undertake major new 
programs at home bush is sure to emphasize successes abroad as he 
keynotes the electionyear congressional session 
seeking to head off the inevitable pressure for peace dividend 
cuts in the defense budget bush said in advance that he will soon 
present a new military plan of his own to restructure americas 
defenses in the wake of the dramatic changes that are taking place 
abroad 
the defense budget he will present on monday seeks an increase 
in pentagon spending but bush said it will begin the transition 
to a restructured military a new strategy that is more flexible 
more geared to contingencies outside of europe while continuing to 
meet our inescapable responsibility to nato and to maintaining the 
global balance 
bush also will ask congress to promote the environmental 
protection agency to cabinet rank that will be the 15th seat at 
the cabinet table 
overall it is a managers agenda not a script for dramatic 
change or a catalog of republican issues for the campaign year 
bush said going in that his agenda was not one of drastic change 
but of building on eight years of republican administration under 
reagan 
the major arena of change in 1989 was outside his reach 
although it certainly worked to his benefit the administration and 
congress could only react and respond to the largely peaceful 
revolution that undid communist dominance in eastern europe 
for a while democratic leaders criticized bush saying he was 
too timid and too passive but the issue didnt take 
republicans are trying to make eastern europe into a 1990 issue 
on their own terms contending their military and foreign policies 
created the conditions for change 
freedom and democracy are breaking out across this entire 
planet republican national chairman lee atwater told party 
leaders i guarantee you that would not be happening today if it 
were not for a decade of leadership by ronald reagan and george 
bush 
the guarantee is debatable but there is no question that bush 
has been buoyed by those changes and by public support for his 
intervention in panama 
for all of that there is no sign that his current popularity 
will enable the administration to move many votes or to build a 
reaganstyle coalition in congress 
that has more to do with the last election than with the latest 
polls in winning the white house bush saw his republican ticket 
lose strength in congress democrats gained three seats in the 
house one in the senate 
a winning presidential candidate usually leads his party to 
congressional gains but bush did not he ran weaker than 
congressional candidates in 389 of the 435 house districts 
offyear elections historically are difficult for the presidents 
party the white house party hasnt gained house seats in an off 
year since 1934

richard gordon darman is in the unenviable 
position of trying to reduce an enormous federal deficit that many 
say he helped create during the reagan administration congress and 
the nation will get a long look at darmans handiwork on monday 
when he lays out president bushs first fullfledged budget 
proposal 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
george bush says he slumps into about 60 
minutes of gloom every time dick darman drops by the oval office 
still the budget director wins more presidential blessings than 
most anyone even as some people think hes as much culprit as 
savior for the ill message he bears 
even within the administration darman past servant of six 
federal departments and four republican presidents is the white 
house insider everyone loves to hate by the halfserious account 
of other cabinet officers he is an unreformed scrooge one who 
arises from his nocturnal visions ready to turn not his own but 
somebody elses leaf 
drug czar william bennett put it this way last month its 
that time of year christmas and armwrestling with dick darman 
darman 46 is far more than george bushs budget planner hes 
a thinker and a tinkerer whether its over a nickelanddime 
change in a presidential speech or a multibilliondollar shift in 
the basic institutions of government 
at his office darman for weeks has been honing a 1991 budget 
which by law must reduce deficit spending in the next fiscal year 
to 64 billion a cut of about 40 billion from the 1990 shortage 
and which by presidential promise cant be achieved with a tax 
increase 
most every night the 5foot9 180pound darman has been 
doodling before crawling into bed he puts the finishing touches 
on a dream scheme for himself half letter half diagram with 
squiggles and arrows and all sorts of code words related to the 
next days challenge then he props it on his nightstand ready for 
further jottings if some economic wraith strikes in his sleep 
i may be crazy but i think i get a lot of work done while im 
sleeping he has said my mind will make linkages and at 3 
or 4 or 5 in the morning or whenever id naturally wake up ive 
suddenly got three or four ideas that fit right in as the logical 
next bits of work 
the president of course is the final arbiter of richard gordon 
darmans handiwork but by all accounts the budget director wins 
most disputes with his cabinet colleagues bennett lost hundreds of 
millions in the internal debate over how much to spend on the drug 
war defense secretary dick cheney who himself cut billions from 
the pentagon budget in the wake of the global collapse of hardline 
communist governments lost an additional 5 billion to darmans 
arguments cheney wanted at least 297 billion next year darman 
proposed 290 billion bush made it 292 billion 
darman is the repository of all the hard decisions said 
john h sununu white house chief of staff when you have to say 
the eitheror you cant get two people to do that you have to get 
one person and its dick darman 
ive got enormous budget problems bush recently told a 
group of reporters i feel very strongly about it because darman 
just walked out and when you see him walking out i go through a 
period of about 60 minutes of gloom before i refocus on what else 
is happening out there 
no budget director is expected to be the life of the 
presidential party but darman lately has been spreading woe of a 
variety quite beyond that of the parent denying junior an increase 
in his allowance 
last summer in a speech variously greeted as courageous or 
disingenuous darman stood before the powerlunch crowd at the 
national press club and decried what he called the nownowism 
abroad in the land that word one of several invented by darman 
over the years he defined as the nations selfindulgence our 
collective shortsightedness our obsession with the here and now 
our reluctance to adequately address the future he added in 
our public policy as to some degree in our private behavior 
we consume today as if there were no tomorrow 
now hold on this from a man who took a little stroll in the 
white house parking lot nine years ago and told thenbudget 
director david stockman to indulge ronald reagans tax cuts even 
as he agreed they would produce budgetary chaos this from a man 
whose imprint is upon virtually every other consumption and 
debtdriving feature of reaganomics including the tax reform act 
of 1986 this from a man when asked last year how long the 
president would abide by his nonewtaxes pledge in the face of 
burgeoning debt replied as a starting position i would say we 
might as well assume forever 
in his book triumph of politics stockman wrote that darman 
in their parkinglot conversation on the prospective tax cut back 
in 1981 said that i dont know which is worse winning now and 
fixing up the budget mess later or losing now and facing a 
political mess in the end stockman said darman decided we 
win it now we fix it later 
later is now and it has fallen to darman like nobody else to 
fix it few question his technical credentials he is said to know 
budget arithmetic as well as stockman and so far with one notable 
setback heading bushs abortive drive last year for a cut in the 
capital gains tax he has been the better salesman and many 
predict he will win the capital gains fight this year just as he 
engineered the compromise incometax overhaul in 1986 when it 
appeared that effort too was dead in the water 
congressional democrats meanwhile are awaiting the 1991 budget 
blueprint with some consternation last year darman drew up the 
bush revisions to reagans final budget submittal while the 
new administration talked a soft cooperative line with congress 
it resorted to a fair amount of accounting gimmickry to meet the 
grammrudman deficit reduction target moreover it proposed cuts 
only in broad terms leaving the onus for trimming specific 
programs on congress itself 
now some fear darman may be giving bush more room to duck and 
hide on the budget because he has ordered a major structural 
change in the way it is presented the information that used to be 
spread across seven hefty volumes has been whittled into a single 
book darman promised no loss in specificity but others knowing 
darmans skills for cloaking controversy in ambiguity are 
suspicious

though largely unsung darman was a top economic policymaker in 
the reagan adminstration moving from the white house to the 
treasury department as the no 1 deputy to james a baker who is 
now secretary of state he quit to join a wall street firm for 19 
months late in the reagan years but bush recalled him this time 
to the omb post 
against that background some find it startling at the least 
that darman should be crying wolf these days about the nations 
economic shortsightedness robert greenstein director of the 
center on budget and policy priorities said he was a little 
distressed at the columns that played darman as a hero for having 
the courage to give the press club speech whereas the reality is 
hes one of the principal culprits 
look at the budget he helped create last february the bush 
budget in which they tried to camouflage the cuts so nobody would 
criticize the administration for cutting program x and program y 
it was the ultimate feelgood budget the ultimate noguts budget 
even ronald reagan had the guts to tell you what he wanted to 
cut greenstein said 
conservative political analyst kevin phillips said heres 
somebody whose been involved in the trade deficit the budget 
deficit the rise of the united states as the worlds leading 
debtor all of these things were aspects of an economy of which he 
was an architect and of course the 1986 tax reform which is 
generally regarded as promoting consumption and thats what 
darman was complaining about 
rep leon panetta dcalif chairman of the house budget 
committee said its a little bit like the fox in the chicken 
coop yelling theres a fox in the chicken coop 
for his part darman acknowledges that not all his past 
stratagems have been unqualified successes but what is the 
appropriate standard he asked all those programs are much 
better than none 
he prides himself as a pragmatist and compromiser i am a 
longterm idealist and a shortterm realist he said i really 
like to look at what works and whats feasible 
dick loves the machinations said kenneth m duberstein 
former reagan administration lobbyist he has this way of 
focusing way ahead seeing the obstacles the hurdles and figuring 
how to jump them 
darman compares the process of compromise to a game of pinball 
you put a ball in play with a ballistic shot and now your world 
is filled with all kinds of bumpers and random possibilities he 
once said but the important thing is the flippers are in your 
control its bump and flip bump and flip a convoluted approach 
to the goal 
rarely does he take a day off other than weekends he routinely 
gets to the white house at dawn ready for a 715 am meeting with 
sununu his chief ally at the executive mansion baker his former 
boss in the reagan years is another fierce supporter 
on a personal level there are two richard darmans one has 
repeatedly charmed the congress aside from the capitalgains 
stumble and earned plaudits from the severest administration 
critics house speaker thomas foley dwash talks of his 
unfailing good humor and easy and pleasant manner pete v 
domenici of new mexico the senate budget committees senior 
republican raves about him as a strategic thinker second to 
none the house budget chairman panetta acknowledges that 
weve enjoyed each others company 
he has a fast and mischievous wit but some members of his staff 
widely credited as the brightest within the administration find 
him quirky cutting and arrogant how could anyone think that 
way he has been known to demand of aides sometimes sending them 
off in tears 
others too have found him abrasive and howard baker of 
tennessee the former senate republican leader and reagans last 
chief of staff coined an adjective darmanesque which is 
now part of washingtons lexicon it means said baker too 
clever by half 
darman the son of a textile industrialist was born in 
charlotte nc and raised in rhode island and massachusetts he 
is thoroughly a harvard man having earned his ba in 1964 and 
his masters in business administration three years later he 
taught at harvards graduate school of government during the carter 
administration 
his government service started with the nixon administration in 
1970 when he was recruited by thenhealth secretary elliot 
richardson his best friend to this day and who rates darman as 
at the top of all the bright young people ive worked with 
when richardson was named attorney general as the watergate scandal 
brewed darman followed him to the justice department there he 
served on the strategy team that negotiated the felony conviction 
and resignation of vice president spiro t agnew enabling a 
credible successor gerald ford to be sworn in before watergate 
brought nixon down it was creative problemsolving said 
darman 
in that period darman got what he calls his one pure shock 
in his government career the famed saturday night massacre 
that led richardson himself and others to resign when nixon 
ordered the attorney general to fire the watergate prosecutor so 
weird he told the new york times leaving government for doing 
what you think is right like some political prisoner it seemed 
so totally unamerican like a parody of a police state 
darman returned under president ford when he hooked up with 
baker then an undersecretary at the commerce department their 
careers have been intertwined ever since 
still darman professes disinterest in the washington power 
chase its too easy to get caught up in the notion that this 
culture tends to reinforce that we really are as powerful as some 
people choose to pretend he has said 
his wariness doubtlessly stems in part from the watergate 
experience and friends say it derives too from the influence of 
his wife and mother of his two sons kathleen emmet a cultural 
historian and reportedly a closet critic of the administration 
the two shun the washington social mill preferring the quiet life 
at their home in mclean va 
then to sleep perchance to dream of pinball and yet another 
convoluted path to his goal the next ballistic shot the 1991 
budget of the united states is due monday

on the corner of dr david pages desk 
rests a foothigh stack of newly published genetics textbooks they 
matteroffactly describe the location of the sexdetermining 
factor the single gene that settles the question of whether a 
fertilized egg will be a boy or a girl 
the gene was pages discovery its rapid rise to the status of 
accepted wisdom is hardly a surprise for when he revealed it at a 
news conference the announcement was a major event in the world of 
genetics 
isolating the gene was a milestone in basic biology the prize 
in an exhausting race and the kind of achievement on which 
distinguished careers are built clearly a breakthrough in a field 
that uses the word sparingly 
or so it seemed 
the story was simple one tiny bit of genetic code rules gender 
if we have it at the moment we are conceived we will be male if 
not well be female 
just two years after pages announcement the precise location 
of the sexdetermining factor is a mystery again the gene he 
found while interesting and probably important is almost 
certainly not it 
the case illustrates the skittish and often whimsical way 
science moves rather than flowing forward in a neat sane way 
facts and theories cobbled together to fit them emerge in a 
jerky tango of discovery and setback a new set of lab results can 
turn breathtaking insight to smoke 
page is a staff scientist at the whitehead institute an elite 
center for genetics research across the street from massachusetts 
institute of technology while still in training at mit he used to 
smile at a cartoon on a biology professors door theory like 
mist on eyeglasses obscures vision 
pages theory accepted by many is now in shambles but its 
not the first time people have been wrong about the location of the 
sexdetermining factor a decade ago many believed it was a gene 
called hy and some textbooks still state this unequivocally 
pages quest to find the sex switch began in 1982 like others 
he tried to track it down by a process of elimination 
everyone is born with 46 strings of genes called chromosomes 
two of these called x and y are the sex chromosomes women have 
two xs while men have an x and a y scientists reason that the 
gene that makes men different from women must be located someplace 
on the y 
page and others have concentrated on apparent exceptions to the 
rule socalled xx males to all outward appearances these people 
are physically normal men but their cells contain the double xs 
of women through a genetic mixup one of their xs contains a 
tiny fragment of y enough to make them men 
among those he studied was an xx man with just half of 1 percent 
of a y chromosome within this bit of dna he found a gene that was 
shared by other xx males he postulated this was tdf 
testisdetermining factor the sex switch 
his description of the gene and his idea of what it did were 
published in december 1987 in the journal cell it was a depressing 
moment for dr peter n goodfellow at the imperial cancer research 
fund in london whose team was just a few months from making the 
same discovery 
page was almost certain he had correctly identified tdf but 
remembers feeling uneasy when colleagues flashed slides during 
lectures that confidently called it that you try as hard as you 
can to say that something is a working hypothesis and it gets 
boiled down even in a textbook to established fact 
to be on the safe side he named his gene zfy or ylinked zinc 
finger protein a reference to the kind of chemical structure it 
makes then he and other scientists searched for evidence that zfy 
is tdf but when new pieces of the puzzle emerged they didnt 
quite fit 
if you get something that is right more and more things start 
clicking into place said goodfellow what happened with the 
zfy story is that it didnt get stronger and stronger 
among the conflicting details 
page knew from the start that there was a related gene on the x 
chromosome but when its structure was decoded it was 
disquietingly like zfy if zfy is uniquely male why would females 
have a very similar gene 
all mammals have their own version of zfy but among the 
marsupials such as kangaroos the gene isnt on the y chromosome 
at all it lies on one of the nonsex chromosomes that presumably 
has nothing to do with sex determination 
other xx males turned up who did not carry zfy 
in mouse embryos the gene did not seem to be doing anything at 
the time when sex is determined 
efforts to transplant zfy into female embryos didnt produce 
male mice 
alone any of these tidbits could be explained away maybe the 
male mouse embryos werent producing the zfy protein because 
scientists were looking for it after the gene had already turned 
itself on and off maybe marsupials and their distant relatives 
among placental mammals have simply evolved different means of sex 
determination together though the tidbits raised doubts 
as the data accumulated it seemed to be more and more 
puzzling how it could be the sexdetermining gene said benajmin 
lewin editor of cell that is quite a common situation one sees 
an assumption a model is proposed and then more data accumulate 
that are not consistent with the model and then the model breaks 
the breaking point for this model came with a paper in december 
in the journal nature goodfellow had found four xx males who 
carried a bit of the y chromosome but not the part with zfy on it 
he argued that somewhere in the fragment they shared was the true 
sexdetermining factor 
while page was unmoved by the earlier skepticism over zfy 
goodfellows discovery was a shock it hit me sure in part 
because i did not know this was coming until it was published he 
could dismiss the other evidence as circumstantial but goodfellow 
had used precisely the same line of reasoning to attack zfys role 
as page had used to support it 
this makes it clear that zfy is not the only sexdetermining 
function on the y page said its possible that zfy has 
little if anything to do with sex determination 
goodfellow isnt gloating if he had found zfy first he said 
he would have written the paper page wrote a lot of people have 
said to me it shows that david page got it wrong everyone likes 
to see a hero fall 
its not really like that yes his interpretation was 
incorrect but if you go back and look at it he put forward what 
seemed to be the best hypothesis at the time 
now goodfellow and page are back where they were competing to 
find the sex trigger gene 
im not in the position of wanting to stand up and crow 
goodfellow said we are testing the most likely hypothesis that 
may be wrong or maybe david will publish finding a gene in this 
region tomorrow

human tests will begin soon on a device 
that supplies oxygen to the bloodstream while removing carbon 
dioxide a sort of artificial lung that developers say could help 
tens of thousands of people each year 
the intravascular oxygenator can be used up to seven days 
satisfying as much as half the bodys needs developers say it 
isnt a lung replacement but a lifesaving boost to see a patient 
through a crisis 
this device does not heal the lung said dr terry clemmer 
chief of critical care medicine at lds hospital this device buys 
us some time to create an environment more conducive to healing 
the lung 
the ivox developed by dr jd mortensen is inserted into the 
inferior vena cava the large vein carrying blood to the heart 
through an incision in the neck or groin a bundle of tubes in it 
carries oxygen to the blood carbon dioxide passes through fiber 
walls into the tubes and out of the body it uses new membrane 
technology to provide as much oxygen as larger external devices 
the surface area of the human lung is roughly that of a tennis 
court said dr john watson chief of cardiovascular devices at the 
national heart lung and blood institute in bethesda md the ivox 
is nowhere near the size of a tennis court but hes certainly 
been able to squeeze a large surface area into a relatively small 
device and thats by using these hollow fibers 
the clinical evaluations are expected to show that a patient 
suffering acute respiratory failure can be supported more safely 
and at lower cost with ivox than with current methods mortensen 
said in animal tests lasting up to 19 days it didnt damage the 
blood or organs in 150 sheep and dogs 
the first phase of human tests will involve 10 patients and will 
begin once theyre chosen it is intended to confirm the animal 
results and ivoxs safety a second broader study of its 
effectiveness could begin this summer 
in addition to lds medical centers in the first phase are penn 
states hershey medical center the university of michigan medical 
center in ann arbor and the los angeles countyuniversity of 
southern california medical center the hershey and lds teams 
received the first devices three weeks ago 
ivox was developed and manufactured at cardiopulmonics a salt 
lake citybased firm specializing in the development of gas 
permeable membranes and specialized critical care devices 
mortensen cardiopulmonics chairman had produced an earlier 
version that didnt exchange enough gases 
in september the food and drug administration approved an 
investigational device exemption that cleared the way for limited 
human testing after both phases are complete the data will be 
reviewed by the fda 
ivox could be used in situations where a patient is breathing 
oxygen through a nasal mask or an endotracheal tube and ventilator 
that arent working well mortensen said it also could help 
patients recover from acute episodes of respiratory failure 
resulting from inhalation of smoke or noxious agents drugs severe 
pneumonia and scores of other ailments he said it could help tens 
of thousands of people each year 
as far as its clinical benefit thats still to be 
determined watson said basically this type of step forward 
sort of opens the door 
patients who would qualify during phase one must be extremely 
sick near death and require pure oxygen mortensen said most will 
see benefit in two to five days when they can change to a regular 
ventilator 
those who dont improve would present an ethical dilemma though 
mortensen and clemmer maintain such cases would be unusual 
if they become dependent on the device to avoid death that is 
one of my greatest fears because its only approved for seven 
days clemmer said in a case like that he said hospital 
officials and the patients family would have to decide whether to 
leave the patient on the device past the test period 
before ivox the only support for patients with respiratory 
failure has been mechanical ventilation in which oxygen at varying 
concentrations is blown into the lung under pressure however the 
pressure and high concentrations can damage already weakened lungs 
by reducing the time a patient is attached to a respirator 
developers say costs and mortality can be reduced

mr yuk whose putrid green face has peered 
from poisons for almost two decades in america is now warning 
european children 
while the look is the same the name has changed because 
feminists in liverpool england think the courtesy title is well 
yukky 
yuk plain and simple is far more palatable 
there was some sensitivity about the mr weve never had 
that problem anyplace in the united states i know of said 
richard garber director of the institute of education 
communications at childrens hospital of pittsburgh 
the bright green sticker with the stuckout tongue and squinting 
eyes touted as a face only a parent could love made its 
international debut in liverpool in late october there was some 
speculation as to whether yuk should be replaced by some other 
distasteful term because yuk is a common surname in liverpools 
asian community but ethnic groups said they werent offended 
none of the 46 us poison centers using mr yuk has altered the 
name each centers phone number encircles the sticker copyrighted 
by childrens hospital 
garber a former teacher and guidance counselor who helped 
create mr yuk isnt miffed over the missing mr id like to 
keep mr yuk because thats the way we started really but mr yuk 
does not have to be a mister 
experts say the need for mr yuk by whatever name is as 
great as when it was introduced in 1972 as an alternative to the 
skullandcrossbones 
about 70 of the 130 centers that pool data got 13 million calls 
about toxic exposures in 1988 the most recent figures available 
said dr william robertson president of the american association 
of poison control centers inc twothirds involved children in 
all the death toll was 545 26 of them kids 
experts agree most poisonings occur at home and can be 
prevented the 46 centers in the mr yuk program expect to 
distribute 3 million sheets of stickers in 1990 free of charge as 
part of that prevention 
people really dont know what a poison is garber said 
most people will think of a poison as something thats ugly that 
kills bugs that cleans drains and things like that the 
products the kids are getting into are products used in the home 
every day attractively packaged and scented 
pharmaceutical items like aspirin and cough medicine are the 
main attraction for children followed by cleaning substances 
plants and health care and beauty products according to garber 
youngsters usually swallow such substances at mealtime he said 
kids are hungry theyre thirsty and mom is busy 
mr yuk strips away most if not all of the appeal according to 
robertson and being instantly recognizable helps 
telephone polls in the seattle area show more than 95 percent of 
the public is familiar with mr yuk said robertson who serves as 
medical director of the washington poison network and the seattle 
poison center other warning labels officer ugh a rattlesnake 
with nosiop poison spelled backward a skull next to a 
telephone receiver just dont seem to be as memorable 
when we say do you know what mr yuk is they say yes and 
they can describe it over the phone he said its a vehicle 
that has helped to acquaint the entire community not just parents 
of little kids

many toddlers who are slow to speak fail 
to outgrow the problem by the time they reach age 3 suggesting 
treatment should be considered to expand their vocabulary a 
scientist says 
traditional wisdom has counseled a waitandsee attitude for 2 
year olds with delayed language development said rhea paul an 
associate professor of speech and hearing sciences at portland 
state university 
but while some such toddlers improve spontaneously many who 
show early signs of trouble expressing themselves may experience 
longterm difficulty in language and school achievement she 
said 
pauls study involved 42 toddlers with language considered 
normal and 36 considered language delayed producing fewer 
than 10 intelligible words at 18 to 23 months or fewer than 50 
words or no twoword combinations by 24 to 34 months of the 
2yearolds who were language delayed 41 percent couldnt 
express themselves as well as they should have by age 3 paul 
found and more than half of the 3yearolds showed delays in their 
ability to understand 
paul said slow development of language ability may be linked to 
immature or underdeveloped abilities to socialize with other 
children if so treatment by a specialist should emphasize the use 
of language in daily conversation and social situations she said

scientists have isolated natural soil 
bacteria that can detoxify cancercausing vinyl chloride and 
related pollutants 
our work should lead to practical biological methods for 
cleansing the environment of these toxic chemicals in the near 
future said charles castro a chemist at the university of 
california riverside 
vinyl chloride which the environmental protection agency says 
causes cancer is used for making polyvinyl chloride pipes and 
insulation pvc which isnt considered carcinogenic also is used 
in floor tiles and upholstery 
vinyl chloride and other related chemicals called organic 
halides including funguskilling edb and dbcp reach the 
environment as pesticides or manufacturing byproducts edb and dbcp 
have been found to pollute groundwater in some areas 
the bacteria isolated by castro produce enzymes that break 
chemical bonds responsible for the toxicity of vinyl chloride and 
other organic halides the breakdown products further decompose to 
create nontoxic substances such as carbon dioxide simple alcohols 
and organic acids the university said 
castro said his research is aimed at making it commercially 
possible to use the bacteria to detoxify the pollutants he said 
research first must show exactly how and how quickly the process 
works

infected inflamed sinuses can masquerade 
as a dental problem by causing a toothache in the upper molars 
says an association of ear nose and throat doctors 
patients should be suspicious that they have sinusitis and not 
dental problems if their pain is combined with nasal discharge or 
stuffiness and if the tenderness is localized in the upper jaw 
area said dr david w kennedy of the american academy of 
otolaryngologyhead and neck surgery 
moira dewilde the groups spokeswoman said the academy decided 
to publicize the problem after a staff member rushed to her dentist 
in acute pain only to find the problem was with her sinuses not 
her teeth 
the maxillary sinus cavity above the upper jaw has membranes 
that can be inflamed and swollen by infection causing pain and 
tenderness in the upper jaw and teeth the condition acute 
sinusitis usually happens after a cold flu or allergy attack 
causes swelling of membranes in the nose the swelling blocks tiny 
openings from the sinuses to the nose allowing mucus to build up 
in the sinuses and causing a feeling of pressure 
dental xrays may not reveal sinusitis which can be treated 
with antibiotics to fight the bacterial infection and with 
decongestants to reduce swelling and help the sinus drain 
recurrent or persistent sinus infections sometimes require surgery

exxon corp said the cost of cleaning up the 
alaska oil spill has reached about 2 billion and cautioned that 
the final tab could climb higher still 
the company on wednesday reported taking a 500 million 
aftertax charge for the fourth quarter to cover expenses for 
cleaning some 1000 miles of alaska shoreline soiled when the exxon 
valdez ran aground last march the charge contributed to a 40 
percent drop in earnings in the period 
previously exxon took charges of 880 million in the first and 
second quarters for the cleanup the company also has said it 
expects to have in excess of 400 million in insurance proceeds 
to help pay for the spill 
william randol analyst with the investment firm first boston 
corp said he was surprised by the size of the latest provision 
thats a lot of money randol said 
bernard picchi analyst with salomon brothers inc said the 
provision might include money for environmental costs other than 
the alaska spill as well as potential legal costs 
there might be more there than meets the eye picchi said 
if it does include any provision for lawsuits i can guarantee 
they wont say it 
exxon officials refused to specify in detail how the 500 
million in the latest charge had been spent but they said the 
funds covered only cleanup costs and were not being set aside for 
potential legal liabilities 
it would be interesting to see a breakdown showing exactly 
where the money went said dennis kelso alaskas commissioner of 
environmental conservation 
theyve certainly been spending a substantial amount of money 
on spill response but i dont have any way of evaluating whether 
thats an accurate assessment he said referring to the 2 
billion figure 
company spokesman bill smith hinted that more charges could 
follow in 1990 
weve spent about 2 billion on the cleanup smith said 
this is our best judgment on what it will cost we dont know if 
it will be more 
exxon halted cleanup for the winter and has said it would survey 
the area after the spring thaw to determine whether additional 
treatment is necessary 
in the three months ended dec 31 exxon said its net earnings 
were 785 million or 61 cents a share down 43 percent from 14 
billion or 106 a share in the comparable 1988 period revenue 
rose 15 percent to 266 billion from 23 billion 
the worlds largest oil company said fourthquarter earnings 
would have been 13 billion or 101 a share if not for the 
cleanup charge 
in keeping with the industry trend exxon said higher crude 
prices in the fourth quarter helped boost its exploration and 
production earnings while refining marketing and chemicals 
earnings declined 
for the year exxons earnings fell 28 percent to 38 billion 
or 298 a share from 53 billion or 395 a share in 1988 
revenue rose about 9 percent to 961 billion from 886 billion 
the alaska spill occurred last march 24 when an exxon tanker 
ran aground in prince william sound and spilled some 11 millions 
gallons of oil 
the nations worst oil spill occurred last march 24 when an 
exxon tanker ran aground in prince william sound and spilled some 
11 million gallons of crude oil environmentalists and government 
officials criticized the company harshly saying it responded too 
slowly to contain the spill 
the financial effect of the exxon valdez accident was clearly 
the major reason for lower net income in 1989 exxon chairman 
lawrence g rawl said in a news release 
exxon said the latest spillrelated provisions still do not 
cover the cost of potentially damaging lawsuits that number more 
than 150 so far and could take years to settle 
the provisions also do not cover costs associated with exxons 
latest pollution incident a jan 2 pipeline rupture that left 
567000 gallons of heating oil floating in the arthur kill waterway 
between new york city and new jersey exxon has offered to cover 
the costs of environmental studies and cleanup of that spill which 
has generated lawsuits of its own including one by the state of 
new jersey 
exxon said its fullyear results also reflected an accounting 
change that boosted earnings by 535 million in the first quarter

satellite television industry officials say 
sales of home dishes are making a slow comeback four years after 
signal scrambling sent the market into a tailspin 
but with half of the nations estimated 28 million dish owners 
still receiving their signals through illegal decoders officials 
are planning a crackdown on piracy to try to boost their industrys 
image 
piracy not only keeps some legitimate businessmen out of our 
business it keeps consumers from buying because of the stigma they 
perceive said chuck hewitt president of satellite broadcasting 
and communications association the industrys trade group 
one of the reasons we believe 1990 will be a good year is we 
believe we can bring piracy under control 
delegates attending the trade groups winter convention here 
this week were generally upbeat over projections that some 350000 
home satellite television dishes would be sold in 1990 
thats about even with 1988 and 1989 but well above 1986 sales 
in that year plummeted to 200000 units from 750000 in 1985 after 
major broadcasters began to scramble their signals 
were making a gradual comeback but we dont see big growth 
until 1991 or 1992 hewitt said 
officials are pinning their growth hopes on a variety of 
subscription packages now being marketed nationally that are 
generally cheaper than cable television 
consumers with satellite receivers equipped with legitimate 
descramblers which nearly all new systems now have can call 
tollfree numbers and order just about any scrambled stations they 
want including pay stations such as hbo showtime and the disney 
channel 
thats in addition to some 75 other unscrambled channels that 
are available free to dish owners 
we are slowly overcoming the confusion among consumers about 
scrambling hewitt said by ordering these packages consumers 
are paying the programmers but can still get two pay services and 
14 to 16 channels for under 20 a month 
hewitt said his organization is starting to crack down on 
illegal descramblers with investigations and legal action against 
dealers who sell illegal decoders and people who use them with as 
many as half of all current dish owners using illegal devices some 
potential customers shun buying a dish because they think they will 
be doing something under the table he said 
our message is weve got a great value here already and 
theres no reason not to pay for legitimate programming services 
he said weve got some people who could buy eight or nine years 
of legitimate services for the money they pay for a descrambler 
trying to get it illegally 
although the industry touts its programming prices as lower than 
cable the average satellite system remains costly 
dealers at the show were hawking receiverdish combinations 
beginning at about 2000 with some fancier systems running 
several thousand dollars more 
even the basic units give you remote control and compact disc 
quality sound though hewitt said and the picture quality is 
better than you can get anywhere 
unlike previous industry shows this years convention space was 
40 percent rented by programming packagers including hbo which is 
marketing its own station along with cinemax and 20 other stations 
for 2175 a month 
we dont release subscription figures but were very pleased 
with our sales said bob caird an hbo vice president a 
considerable number of home satellite owners prefer receiving their 
favorite channels in one neat package 
hewitt said about 630000 satellite dish owners nationwide now 
buy programming from various sources with total spending of about 
150 million a year

numbers chryslers midjanuary truck sales which include 
minivans soared 356 percent over the same period last year while

trucks at an average daily rate of 29677 vehicles during the jan 
1120 period compared with 28619 during the same time last year

opposed with early january which we thought was abnormally high

the nations top stock and bonds policeman 
wants federal law changed to prevent savings and loans from selling 
their own securities 
if a customer walks in with a social security check we dont 
think they should be able to walk out with a junk bond 
securities and exchange commission chairman richard c breeden said 
the comment made wednesday in a speech to a meeting of the 
securities regulation institute referred to irvinebased lincoln 
savings amp loan association whose failure is expected to cost 
taxpayers 2 billion 
lincoln is fighting a classaction lawsuit on behalf of 23000 
investors who bought nowworthless unsecured bonds of lincolns 
parent american continental corp at lincoln branches 
the sale of the highrisk highyield junk bonds was permitted 
under federal and state laws 
but the investors many of them elderly californians who lost 
their life savings contend they were led to believe the bonds were 
federally insured like savings accounts 
breeden said allowing the sale of such bonds inside savings and 
loan branches was an invitation for fraud 
meeting with reporters separately breeden said longterm 
investors would be making a mistake to flee the stock market 
despite its recent losses and volatility 
he acknowledged that small investors might be scared by stories 
of computer trading and corrections that now drive prices down 
sharply in hours instead of days or weeks but said they would do 
well to hold on for the long haul 
for the individual investors who bought securities on jan 1 
last year and held them until dec 31 they had an aggregate gain 
of 31 percent last year breeden said 
i would think it would be a shame for people who are saving 
for the long term to buy a house or pay for a college education 
to give up a 31 percent return for a bank cd at 7 percent 
he made clear he was not guaranteeing the performance of any 
given stock 
breeden also urged congress and the bush administration to knock 
down a variety of domestic hindrances to the free flow of money 
saying that an economically deregulated europe in 1992 would 
otherwise overcome americas competitive edge as an attractive site 
for investment 
the europeans are systematically removing the barriers among 
their 12 nations standardizing disclosure regulations takeover 
rules banking laws he said 
he urged congress to allow banks to set up affiliated securities 
companies something that is banned now under the glasssteagall 
act 
breeden also called on congress to remove barriers to stock 
market trading of hybrid securities that have elements of 
futures 
a federal court recently banned trading of a stockindex future 
on the philadelphia and american stock exchange because of 
restrictions limiting such products to commodities exchanges 
similar securities are available to investors on the london and 
toronto stock exchanges 
at a separate session former sec chairman david s ruder who 
presided over the sec during two years that included the october 
1987 stock market crash and the wall street inside trading 
scandals called for a major sec study of wideranging securities 
industry reforms like one undertaken in 1962 
there should be a study not only of volatility but of 
littleknown problems in the industry and we need to assess 
whether the crazyquilt regulation we have in the us over the 
banking and securities industries is the right one ruder said 
breeden agreed that having separate regulators for stocks and 
bonds commodities and banking had led to problems in an 
increasingly interconnected financial world 
but he said there is too little time to undertake a major study 
like the one in 1962 which took two years 
id like to see congress and the administration get on with 
the task of reforming the securities market he said 
ruder said he felt congress would be forced to reevaluate 
scrapping the glasssteagall act to allow banks to underwrite 
securities 
our financial institutions are going to be at a severe 
competitive disadvantage in the world if they cannot engage in 
banking and securities transactions at the same time he said

exxon will not set up a large base in 
valdez next spring whether or not it decides to continue its 
cleanup work on prince william sound shorelines blackened in the 
nations worst oil spill 
exxon will keep its spill headquarters in anchorage otto 
harrison head of the companys cleanup effort said wednesday the 
alaska department of environmental conservation is expected to do 
the same and the coast guard already has moved to alaskas largest 
city 
exxon corps fourthquarter profits plunged more than 40 
percent because of the nearly 2 billion it spent cleaning the 
spill the company announced in new york 
in the three months ended dec 31 exxons net earnings were 
785 million or 61 cents a share down 43 percent from 14 
billion or 106 a share in the same period in 1988 the company 
said revenue rose 15 percent to 266 billion from 23 billion 
valdez city manager doug griffin said exxons decision would 
give his hardhit port community a needed breather this summer 
we kind of lost the year in some respects because of the oil 
spill he said 
exxon moved its operation from valdez to anchorage late last 
year as the cleanup wound down harrison said the company 
considered several factors in deciding to keep its headquarters in 
anchorage 
when you take in all the locations were looking at valdez 
seward cordova your flying conditions are better out of 
anchorage than out of valdez harrison said 
if the company decides to resume its cleanup in the spring it 
likely would send small teams to farflung locations valdez is 
not central to supplying that kind of operation harrison said 
environmental conservation commissioner dennis kelso said exxon 
talked with his agency last week about the switch to anchorage 
i dont see it as a problem for us he said as long as 
the job gets done thats our main concern 
the exxon valdez rammed bligh reef on march 24 spilling about 
11 million gallons of thick crude oil that coated the sound and the 
gulf of alaska after a stuttering start exxon pressed thousands 
of workers into the cleanup 
the huge cleanup turned valdez into a boomtown with garbage 
sewer and housing problems the crime rate soared and exxon 
received several calls from people concerned about tourism and fish 
processing said company spokeswoman christina stevens 
harrison said exxon would not be taking up much hotel or office 
space this summer 
we should not be providing any disruption to the citizens for 
their normal business he said 
no decision has been made about the cleanup effort harrison 
said

debate over a synthetic hormone that makes 
cows give more milk is heating up with a renewed demand by a group 
of farm and consumer advocates to keep milk from test herds from 
going into the consumer market 
the group argues that if the food and drug administration 
refuses to suspend sales until the agency makes a final decision on 
the drug the agency should at least require labels on milk and 
other dairy products that originate from test cows treated with 
bovine growth hormone or bgh 
a similar request for halting distribution of milk from test 
herds was made last august but the fda did not respond brian 
ahlberg of the national farm coalition told a news conference 
the genetically engineered hormone is bovine somatotropin and is 
usually called bst by the agriculture department and the chemical 
companies that make it the hormone also occurs naturally in a 
cows body 
agriculture secretary clayton yeutter said last week in 
discussing the hormone that unenforceable labeling laws have been 
proposed that would attempt to enforce mandatory labeling by 
farmers and processors 
yeutter told the milk industry foundation and international ice 
cream association meeting in palm beach fla that safety for 
consumers animals and environment is the only one criterion on 
which the use of the hormone should hinge 
thus bst measures up on all these counts he said and if 
it continues to do so it should ultimately receive approval for 
commercial use just as should any product that the fda deems to be 
safe 
jeremy rifkin of the foundation for economic trends a longtime 
critic of the synthetic growth hormone said his organization is 
preparing a petition asking the fda for a full thorough 
internal investigation into allegations the agency worked with 
drug companies and has been hiding test results from the public 
rifkin said the hormone has no redeeming social value and is 
bad for farmers cows taxpayers and ultimately perhaps consumer 
health 
however during questions coalition spokesman ahlberg said the 
group was not claiming adverse health effects from milk produced by 
hormonetreated cows 
rifkin also accused fda of promoting the growth hormone before 
the agency has given it final clearance 
this is outrageous rifkin said this is activity that 
should have been condemned a long time ago 
rifkin said if fda approves commercial use of the drug his 
group will seek court action to ban it 
we are determined that this product will never reach the 
marketplace in the united states and europe he said we will 
litigate will inform consumers with the mass media will do 
whatever is necessary 
the fda did not return calls for comment on rifkins allegation 
that the agency has been actively promoting the drug prior to its 
final approval 
speakers said they had no information from the fda about the 
extent of testing or how much milk is entering the us consumer 
pipeline although rifkin and others have said they thought the 
percentage is quite small 
they said producers include herds maintained by landgrant 
universities and private farmers the common practice is to sell 
milk from test herds to local dealers who then mix it with other 
milk for distribution 
sen patrick leahy dvt chairman of the senate agriculture 
committee has asked the general accounting office to investigate 
allegations by dr richard burroughs a fired fda veterinarian 
that tests of the chemical were inadequate 
burroughs has accused the fda of toning down criticism of 
research on the hormone at the request of the chemical companies 
the fda has said the hormonetreated milk is safe to drink 
the hormone is manufactured by monsanto eli lilly upjohn and 
american cyanamid who have said the fda review has been the most 
thorough of any study of animal drugs and the fda says it has not 
made any exceptions in its drugtesting standards

president bush is refusing to rule out a 
republican plan that would ultimately make the social security 
system private as the battle sharpens over a democrats bill 
slashing the retirement systems payroll tax 
bush told reporters wednesday that a plan by rep john e 
porter rill and the no 2 house republican leader newt 
gingrich of georgia to place workers retirement payments into 
private accounts has some interesting ingredients to it and is 
worthy of consideration of some study 
but he added im not prepared to endorse that 
the president cautioned that his 1991 budget proposal which he 
unveils monday will contain a different plan for addressing the 
huge social security surpluses 
but he said people are concerned about social security so 
when you have innovative thinking of that nature i dont want to 
just gun it down im not going to support it 
porter and gingrich want to gradually divert social security 
taxes which are paid by workers and their employers into a sort 
of mandatory individual retirement account 
as workers iras grow their claims on social security would 
decline when todays workers are retired about 50 years from 
now porter estimated social security would be fully privatized 
seldom since republican nominee barry goldwaters losing 1964 
presidential campaign has a national gop figure spoken publicly of 
even the remote possibility of replacing social security with 
private retirement plans 
the portergingrich plan looms as the major gop alternative to a 
plan advanced last month by sen daniel patrick moynihan dny 
moynihan considered one of congress experts on social 
security has proposed scaling back the systems payroll tax once 
immediately and again next january 
he has argued the surplus the social security system is banking 
66 billion this year and growing is cloaking the true size of 
the federal deficit rather than being banked to pay future 
retirement benefits to baby boomers 
bush called moynihans plan a disguise for increased taxes 
around the corner and a sleight of hand operation he 
referred to a separate bill proposed by sen ernest hollings 
dsc that would replace the monies lost by a social security tax 
cut with a new federal sales tax 
moynihan counterattacked on the senate floor later in the day 
there is no sleight of hand whatsoever moynihan replied 
and i do not see that there was any need to make such a 
characterization 
he also questioned bushs characterization of the 
portergingrich bill of innovative thinking asking was it 
innovative thinking after 50 years of steady payments to start 
dismantling social security i dont think so 
also on wednesday 
bush said congress should wait to see his own proposal to 
gradually take social security surpluses out of the federal deficit 
calculation that longrange plan starting in 1993 would require 
that a growing portion of the surplus be used to retire publicly 
held debt 
house speaker thomas s foley dwash said he has serious 
reservations about moynihans proposed tax cut which would require 
congress to find an additional 55 billion for deficit reduction 
this year he said he fears that instead of raising taxes or 
cutting spending to make up the loss congress and the president 
would opt for increased borrowing 
reps byron dorgan dnd and richard durbin dill 
proposed to roll back only this years increase in the social 
security tax rate which rose from 751 percent to 765 percent of 
the first 51300 of wages congress then could use the rest of 
this year to devise a plan for ensuring that social security taxes 
are used solely for social security

robust domestic sales pushed japans motor vehicle 
production to a record high of 13025741 in 1989 up 26 percent 
from the previous year the japan automobile manufacturers 
association said thursday 
jama officials attributed the surge to brisk domestic sales 
totaling 7256669 vehicles up 8 percent from a year earlier 
domestic sales set a record for the eighth consecutive year 
exports however fell an estimated 36 percent to 589 million 
it was the fourth consecutive year of declining exports 
the association is scheduled to release exact 1989 export 
figures at the end of january overseas shipments have been 
diminishing in part because many japanese manufacturers now are 
producing automobiles abroad 
passenger car output climbed 104 percent to a record 9052406 
in 1989 while production of trucks dropped 115 percent to 
3931261 bus production dropped by 267 percent to 42074 
strong personal spending the removal of a commodity tax on cars 
and the introduction of new models helped boost domestic sales 
jama officials said

the energy department is proposing holding its 
nuclear weapons contractors liable for environmental fines and 
other costs resulting from their own negligence 
the proposal announced wednesday by energy secretary james d 
watkins marks the departments most substantial effort to improve 
work at the weapons plants which are plagued by mismanagement 
safety lapses and environmental problems 
this proposal reflects my goal of safeguarding the public and 
protecting the environment watkins said in a statement 
the 17 major weapons production plants and research laboratories 
are owned by the department but operated under longterm contracts 
by private companies since the start of nuclear arms production in 
the 1940s the plant operators have enjoyed virtually complete 
protection from financial liability for their mistakes 
federal auditors last year reported that the energy department 
had paid hundreds of thousands of dollars in environmental fines 
incurred by weapons contractors plus related legal costs that 
totaled about twice as much as the fines 
under the new system contractors would have to pay fines they 
could reasonably have avoided plus legal costs they also would be 
charged for expenses resulting from damage to government property 
although not in all cases 
the department is expected to announce soon a related proposal 
for increasing the amount of bonus money that the contractors can 
earn for excellent performance that would partly offset the 
increased financial liability 
the watkins proposal is subject to change based on comments 
received during a 30day public comment period 
reaction on capitol hill was mixed 
rep ron wyden dore who sponsored legislation last year to 
increase the weapons contractors liability for environmental 
violations said in an interview wednesday that he was not 
satisfied that watkins proposal was tough enough 
it is just full of potential loopholes and i think dangerous 
hedging wyden said he noted as an example a provision that 
would set a ceiling on the amount of damages for which the 
contractors would be liable 
rep david skaggs dcolo whose district includes the rocky 
flats weapons plant issued a statement calling the proposal a 
real victory for common sense he said it offered new hope for 
improving the contractors performance 
now their own money will be at stake and thats a strong 
incentive for contractors to do the job right he said 
steven wakefield the departments general counsel said the 
weapons contractors had been briefed on the outlines of the 
proposal he said some didnt like certain provisions of the plan 
but that none had threatened to quit

union leaders are predicting easy approval of a 
threeyear contract offer giving boeing co engineers 9 percent 
more in annual bonuses than an offer they rejected last month 
daniel m mahoney general counsel of the seattle professional 
engineering employees association said the leadership was 
recommending acceptance after taking no position on the earlier 
offer 
were all happy the negotiators mahoney said we view 
this as quite an achievement 
mahoney said ballots would be mailed to the 9276 members of the 
unions professional unit on monday with a count set for feb 7 
we are pleased that an tentative agreement has been reached 
said paul binder of boeing 
the settlement which would replace a threeyear contract that 
expired dec 1 was negotiated in a 3hour meeting wednesday 
involving the two sides and federal mediator ben youtsey 
it was the second bargaining session since a threeyear offer 
without any general pay raises or bonuses after the first year was 
rejected on a 69 percent vote dec 18 a recess to review positions 
on each side followed a meeting jan 10 
the revised offer includes a 3 percent pay increase in the first 
year and productivity bonuses of 10 percent of gross pay in the 
first year 5 percent in the second and 4 percent in the third 
in addition money equal to 2 percent of all salaries in the 
unit is reserved for additional selective pay increases every six 
months with the entire pool to be spent 
in rejecting the initial offer many engineers noted that boeing 
production workers won three years of bonuses and general wage 
gains in a 48day strike last fall 
the company offer was increased by some 56 million after our 
general management met with the engineering management and 
considered the feedback that we received from engineers binder 
said 
union leaders cited a survey of 100 companies by the engineering 
trade magazine design news that showed boeing engineers generally 
earned 32000 to 35000 after five years one of the lowest pay 
levels among the major companies covered in the report 
binder questioned whether the survey considered regional 
variations in living costs and other factors 
the union which claims to be the largest representing engineers 
and technicians outside the aflcio has no strike fund and has 
never called a walkout strike authorization was rejected in the 
same balloting in which the initial offer was rejected 
the professional unit represents 15245 engineers scientists 
and other highly educated employees nearly all in the seattle 
area with an average salary of 39683 
the 8317 members of the unions other unit which represents 
12796 technicians with an average salary of 28079 voted dec 18 
to accept a threeyear contract with pay hikes of 3 2 and 2 
percent bonuses of 10 5 and 4 percent and a selective pay pool 
of 2 percent a year 
following a 48day strike boeing members of the international 
association of machinists and aerospace workers voted nov 18 to 
accept a contract with pay raises of 4 3 and 3 percent bonuses of 
10 5 and 4 percent and a boost in the cost of living formula from 
86 percent of inflation to nearly 100 percent 
the machinists represent 57800 production workers including 
43300 in the puget sound area and the strike virtually halted 
work at boeing plants in seattle wichita kan and portland ore

an aggressive expansion program that for 
years drained empire of america federal savings banks profits 
ultimately backfired when the states third largest savings and 
loan was placed under federal control 
customers were left uneasy by the governments move wednesday to 
take over financially strapped empire and transfer control to the 
resolution trust corp a federal agency created in august to 
dispose of all failed savings institutions 
im very disappointed said empire customer jenny plotar 
outside a bank branch here weve dealt with them for 40 years 
and i felt so safe and secure now i dont 
but curt reid an rtc official at the banks headquarters 
stressed that it will be business as usual for depositors they 
can continue to deposit and write checks and most importantly 
their money will continue to be federally insured 
analysts were hopeful that the move would result in an infusion 
of capital 
there are many positivies said rosemarie ligotti a vice 
president at prescott ball and turben a stronger company will 
come in and merge with empire 
empire new yorks thirdlargest savings and loan has been 
losing millions since it swallowed up 13 failing sampls with the 
support of federal regulators late last year the thrift announced 
it was insolvent and asked for federal help 
theyve experienced losses for quite some time said robert 
albanese senior deputy director for the new york district of the 
office of thrift supervision at this point we dont see any 
ability for the institution to be recapitalized without government 
assistance 
the resolution trust corp has installed a managing agent and 
removed the board of directors but the banks officers will 
remain albanese said 
empire of america has 125 branches in new york california 
florida michigan and texas in june 1989 it was the 12th largest 
bank in the united states and the third largest in new york with 
113 billion in assets according to sheshunoff information 
services inc a texas firm that rates banks 
however albanese said that the banks assets had dropped to 
88 billion at yearend still he said the thrift was among the 
five largest seized by federal regulators to date rtc has taken 
control of about 280 thrifts and has disposed of more than 30 
nationwide 
the problem was empire had tried to expand in a hurry as it 
bought these sickly sampls between 1981 and 1986 empire found that 
the thrifts liabilities which mostly consist of deposits and can 
be withdrawn any time exceeded the value of their assets by 926 
million 
to make its accounts balance empire added 926 million of 
goodwill to its assets in accounting goodwill is a noncash 
asset but it must be written off over a number of years as a 
charge against the companys income empire found that goodwill was 
draining 95 million to 110 million from its profit each year

nearly 33600 general motors corp and ford motor 
co workers will be laid off for at least a week in the latest 
series of layoffs blamed on slow sales or toohigh inventory 
aside from the layoffs announced wednesday effective in the 
next five weeks at nine car and truck assembly plants the big 
three automakers have announced indefinite layoffs at 11 assembly 
plants affecting more than 13500 employees 
other layoffs in supplier and component plants are likely 
because of the assembly plant shutdowns it is difficult to track 
those plants because of their numbers and the possibility that they 
will continue production and build inventory despite the shutdown 
of an assembly plant they supply 
gm said wednesday that car assembly plants in atlanta and 
doraville ga fairfax kan lansing mich and linden nj 
along with a van plant in lordstown ohio and a truck amp bus group 
plants in baltimore shreveport la and pontiac mich would be 
down for at least a week apiece in late january through 
midfebruary 
the production cuts will affect about 27600 workers 
ford said the new layoffs would involve 5600 workers at plants 
in edison nj kansas city mo and louisville ky and come in 
addition to 5600 layoffs previously announced for the companys 
car and truck plants in lorain ohio 
chrysler corp spokesman doug nicoll said wednesday the no 3 
automaker had no new temporary plant closings to announce through 
midfebruary chrysler will temporarily idle six plants for at 
least a week each resulting in 21600 temporary layoffs

contracts settled through collective 
bargaining last year provided workers average annual wage increases 
of 33 percent over the life of the pacts the government said 
today 
the labor department said 1989 was the first time since 1981 
that negotiated settlements provided larger wage adjustments than 
the contracts they replaced the last time parties to 1989 
settlements negotiated usually in 1986 or 1987 average wage rate 
adjustments were 24 percent over the contract term 
wage restorations in steel and other industries as well as wage 
gains for nurses accounted for the difference the agency said 
last years 33 percent wage gains also were up from the 24 
percent average wage gains contained in collective bargaining 
agreements settled in 1988 
the collective bargaining report like the labor departments 
broader employment cost index report showed workers in the 
fastgrowing service sector winning larger wage gains than 
manufacturing workers service workers received an average of 35 
percent hikes over the life of the contracts while manufacturing 
workers received 32 percent raises 
the labor department said the 459 collective bargaining 
agreements it analyzed covered about 185 million workers the 
government tracks agreements covering bargaining units with at 
least 1000 workers 
the government said 114 such contracts covering 743000 workers 
had been expired or reopened in the last quarter but had not been 
settled or ratified by dec 31 about half of those workers are 
employed in railroads

sales of existing homes edged down in 
december bringing the 1989 total to 343 million units or 46 
percent less than the previous years sales a real estate trade 
group reported today 
the national association of realtors said december sales totaled 
a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 355 million units down 11 
percent from 359 million units in november 
the realtors attributed part of the last months decline to 
severe weather conditions in the northeast and south and to a large 
drop in the west from an extremely high november level 
for the year sales were down from the 1988 total of 359 
million units which the realtors said was the strongest year of the 
decade 
the national median price for existing singlefamily homes in 
december was 92500 43 percent above the december 1988 median of 
88700 the median price for the year was 93100 also up 43 
percent from 1988 
the median price means that half of the homes cost more and half 
less 
realtors president norman d flynn called last years sales 
healthy and said that while they declined in 1989 the decline 
was from the highest resale volume since 1979 
last months resale pace indicates a stable market flynn 
said with plenty of homes available at good prices and 
relatively low mortgage rates it is really a buyers paradise 
right now he said 
sales in the northeast totaled 570000 units on an annual basis 
down 34 percent from november for the year the resale pace was 
585000 units 131 percent below that of 1988 
the northeast median price was 143100 in december up 01 
percent from december 1988 the 1989 median price was 145200 15 
percent higher than 1988 
the essentially unchanged median home prices in the northeast 
reflect a continuing slump in many of the large metropolitan 
areas said john a tuccillo nar chief economist 
the resale pace in the west was 600000 units down 63 percent 
from november the 1989 total was 605000 units 5l8 percent below 
the 1988 total the median price in december was 135300 51 
percent higher than december 1988 while for the year it was 
139900 up 12 percent from 1988 
sales in the south slipped 35 percent in december to 138 
million units for 1989 resales totaled 131 million units 29 
percent below those of 1988 the median price in the south was 
83200 in december 64 percent above that of december 1988 for 
the year the median price was 84500 28 percent above 1988 
the midwest posted the only sales increase in december rising 
31 percent to 990000 units for the year the total was 926000 
units 03 percent below the 1988 total the median price was 
72100 last month 65 percent above december 1988 the 1989

an official of the agency overseeing the 
savings and loan bailout today defended it against complaints from 
democrats that it is dragging its feet in establishing a program to 
provide housing to poor people 
the resolution trust corp is moving forward to quickly 
develop a program said stephen s allen director of the 
agencys low income housing 
however rep henry b gonzalez dtexas chairman of the house 
banking committee said earlier testimony from allens superiors 
did not demonstrate a commitment to making lower income occupancy 
of these properties a reality 
in bailout legislation enacted in august congress instructed 
the rtc to give poor people and lowincome housing groups a 90day 
right of first refusal on lowpriced housing the government is 
inheriting from failed sampls the law gives the agency the option of 
cutting the price on the property but the rtc is not doing that 
for now 
allen acknowledged that only 700 properties are being offered 
initially in the lowincome housing program out of a total of more 
than 26000 residential properties 
however he said about 10000 properties eventually will be 
moved into the lowincome program with most of them 5174 in 
texas 968 in oklahoma and 881 in louisiana 
republicans on the panel said the housing program could increase 
the cost of the bailout to taxpayers the properties should be sold 
as soon as possible to reduce carrying costs they said 
we cant tell the rtc that time is of the essence and then 
hamstring them we have to keep focused on cleaning up the mess 
in the sampl industry said rep toby roth rwis 
meanwhile in testimony wednesday a top regulator edged closer 
to admitting what private analysts have been saying for months 
that president bushs 50 billion savings and loan bailout doesnt 
provide enough money 
l william seidman nicknamed the bailout czar for his dual role 
as chairman of the federal deposit insurance corp and the rtc 
stopped just short of acknowledging taxpayers need to make a second 
installment on the cleanup 
someone will be back to ask for more money one of these days 
i think thats a high probability seidman said 
panel members reacted with dismay but seidman assured them the 
crunch would likely come after congressional elections this 
november 
seidman resisted several efforts to pin him down to a new loss 
estimate but figures in his testimony suggest losses in the range 
of 74 billion to 82 billion 
as of jan 16 the rtc had seized 333 institutions with assets 
totaling 136 billion the loss on those is about 42 billion he 
said the remaining 8 billion would be enough to cover the losses 
at additional sampls with assets of 40 billion 
however the treasury departments office of thrift supervision 
is predicting the failure of another 225 to 295 institutions with 
assets of 160 billion to 200 billion and seidman said his 
agency found no reason to question that estimate 
if the sampls yet to fail have losses in the 20 percent range 
the level in the most recent thrift takeovers total thrift losses 
would be at least 50 percent higher than the 50 billion provided 
in legislation enacted in august 
the thought of more dollars having to be spent on the sampl mess 
sends shudders down the spine of every congressman said rep 
charles schumer dny 
seidman replied probably the shivers will be there maybe we 
can get them past the election 
his assessment was the most pessimistic yet from a government 
official a day earlier deputy treasury secretary john e robson 
conceded it was possible that 50 billion is inadequate but said 
it was too soon to know for certain 
on another subject seidman defended his agency from charges it 
is moving too slowly it has disposed of only 40 sampls since august 
he said the cumbersome bureaucracy created by the bailout bill 
guarantees a slower process 
employees of seidmans fdic an independent regulatory agency 
are doing the bailout work however the policy and pursestrings of 
the bailout are controlled by an administration oversight board 
headed by the treasury secretary 
where does the buck stop in this process its almost 
impossible to tell seidman said 
daniel kearney president of the oversight board disputed that 
were certainly not slowing down the resolution process 
seidman has a free hand on that except for funding and weve given 
him the funding he said in a telephone interview

a second takeover offer for allegheny international inc as the 
small appliance maker struggles to emerge from bankruptcy 
protection

reorganization plan filed late wednesday in us bankruptcy court 
just before todays hearing on allegheny internationals proposal 
for emerging from chapter 11 protection 
japonica issued only sketchy details of its latest plan which 
it said would involve a 650 million allcash deal that is about 
34 million lower than one it proposed in november the offer 
includes a 120 million cash infusion and 375 million in bank 
financing 
allegheny international based in pittsburgh and known for its 
sunbeam and oster small appliances sought protection from 
creditors in february 1988 
robert sable lead attorney for ais bondholders and other 
unsecured creditors hadnt seen the plan but said he suspected it 
is loaded with conditions 
as far as my committee is concerned theres only one plan on 
the table the companys sable said 
a japonica spokesman conceded the groups financing hinges on a 
condition that caused one of ais previous reorganization plans to 
collapse 
japonica also said it would pay holders of ais publicly held 
securities premiums of 25 to 75 percent more than current market 
prices amounts it said top the payouts called for in ais plan 
ai has proposed repaying virtually all of its creditors other 
than trade suppliers in new stock 
ai spokesman edward m romanoff said the company had no comment

a us division of dutch electronics giant 
philips nv said today it will join a joint venture of nbctv and 
the american arm of frances largest electronics company to 
research advanced television systems 
thomson consumer electronics inc the us operation of thomson 
sa of france and philips consumer electronics co announced the 
joint venture at a news conference at nbc headquarters 
the venture eventually is intended to lead to a highdefinition 
television system which would provide picture quality vastly 
improved from todays best sets 
we want us consumers to have access to advanced tv services 
as quickly as possible said j peter bingham vice president of 
technology for philips consumer electronics 
philips which makes the magnavox sylvania and philco brands 
has said it is working on an improved television system called 
highdefinition system for north america 
nbc which is owned by general electric co has been 
cooperating with thomson at the david sarnoff research center in 
princeton nj to develop advanced television systems 
nbc and thomson which owns the former ge and rca television 
lines are working on a system called advanced compatible tv which 
would provide an improved picture on tv sets being developed by 
thomson while allowing continued use of conventional sets 
advanced compatible tv would require only minor lowcost 
adjustments to equipment at local tv stations thomson and nbc said 
last april nbc and thomson tested the system during a news show 
on nbcs new york station wnbc the improved picture was viewed by 
reporters and others on a special tv set at the nonprofit sarnoff 
center nbc said it was the first commercial broadcast of an 
improved tv signal 
but development of the true hdtv system would require a 
reallocation of broadcasting signals by the federal communications 
commission because it would use two channels to broadcast both the 
hdtv signal and a signal compatible with convention tv sets said 
james tietjen president of the sarnoff center 
several japanese companies are working on hdtv systems of their 
own in addition zenith electronics corp the last major us tv 
manufacturer has joined with american telephone amp telegraph co to 
develop an hdtv system 
like the nbcthomson system zeniths system would provide full 
hdtv pictures while remaining compatible with conventional tv sets 
although these existing sets would not receive an improved picture 
said zenith spokesman john taylor 
thomson in 1987 traded its medical equipment business and cash 
for the ge and rca television lines plus the rest of general 
electrics consumer electronics businesses

sold its investors interest in the nations largest airline 
company 
loomis sayles amp co an investment firm based in boston on 
wednesday sold off its stake in texas air the parent of eastern 
airlines and continental airlines last summer loomis sayles 
controlled 123 percent of the company 
i sold every share i owned said ken heebner loomis sayles 
portfolio manager if i had other airlines i would have sold 
them he said airline stocks no longer seem attractive 
some 667 million shares nearly 17 percent of the 40 million 
texas air shares outstanding changed hands wednesday making it 
the most actively traded issue on the american stock exchange 
texas air stock dropped 1rsqb to close at 7rsqb last august when

trading at 18 a share 
texas air spokesman art kent declined to comment on wednesdays

ual corps board of directors has a new option 
to consider a proposal by its three unionized employee groups for 
workers to buy 75 percent of the airline companys stock and leave 
the rest in public hands 
meanwhile ual today reported a 67 percent plunge in 
fourthquarter profit and 71 percent drop in annual net income 
united airlines pilots flight attendants and machinists 
outlined their employee stock ownership proposal in a letter 
wednesday to parent company uals board which is meeting today 
the letter offered few details of the plan nevertheless the 
development marks a distinct change in attitude on the part of the 
machinists union whose opposition to employee ownership and 
increased corporate debt helped scuttle a pilotmanagement bid for 
the company last year 
and it offers a chance for resolution of the 6monthold 
cliffhanger that has preoccupied united the nations 
secondlargest commercial carrier while rival american airlines 
steadily has strengthened its industryleading position 
we are unified as never before in our view that majority 
ownership of the company is the only acceptable means to resolve 
the issues that plague united concluded the groups letter 
the proposal also drew a positive response from a major ual 
shareholder that had been pushing for a recapitalizatin to boost 
the stock price 
the groups letter was signed by john f peterpaul vice 
president of the machinists union frederick c dubinsky chairman 
of the united chapter of the air line pilots association and diana 
robertson president of the united chapter of the association of 
flight attendants 
the union leaders said they were prepared to negotiate as a 
group for the acquisition of stock by all ual employees including 
nonunion workers through one or more employee stock ownership 
plans or esops 
they offered wage concessions and longterm contracts in return 
an esop typically buys stock with borrowed money and pays it 
back over a number of years with dividends on the shares 
the letter contained no details on how the employees proposed to 
structure or finance the purchase of 17 million of uals 226 
million shares or what price the workers would pay the plan would 
cost about 27 billion at wednesdays closing stock price of 
16150 
nor did the letter describe how the stock would be divided among 
the four employee groups union leaders did not return telephone 
calls seeking such details 
all we have here is a statement that the unions are agreeing 
between themselves that they want to own united said airlines 
analyst samuel buttrick of kidder peabody amp co 
the apparent concordance among the unions is a positive 
buttrick said but the notable lack of specifics on structure and 
financing indicates that only minimal progress has been made on an 
ultimate resolution 
separately ual said net income totaled 68 million or 31 
cents a share for the three months ended dec 31 compared with 
209 million or 97 cents a share for the same period of 1988 
revenue totaled 24 billion up from 22 billion in 1988 
for all of 1989 ual reported net income of 3242 million or 
1496 per share on revenue of 98 billion compared with profits 
of 11 billion or 3787 per share on revenue of 9 billion in 
1988 
ual said 1988 earnings included a 393 million pretax gain from 
the partial sale of its covia automated reservations system and a 
5239 million gain from the january 1988 sale of westin hotel co 
in the fourth quarter expenses of 60 million related to last 
years failed buyout bid were partially offset by a 407 million 
gain from stock appreciation rights also keyed to the buyout 
attempt these items combined depressed fourth quarter earnings by 
116 million 
a 34 percent increase in jet fuel expenses also depressed 
earnings ual said 
ual chairman stephen wolf called the results disappointing 
even without buyout related effects 
at todays board meeting ual directors had been scheduled to 
consider a recapitalization urged on the chicagobased company by 
the coniston partners investment group holder of an 118 percent 
stake 
but in an interview wednesday evening coniston principal keith 
gollust praised the esop proposal as a giant step forward and 
said he and his partners were backing away from their insistence on 
a recapitalization to boost the value of ual shares 
he said a recapitalization which likely would involve new 
borrowing by ual to make a payout to shareholders ought to 
remain as a backup alternative 
ual spokesman joe hopkins declined comment on the esop proposal 
in return for a majority stake in the company the employees 
said they were prepared to make significant investments 
including accepting lower wages and sign fiveyear contracts

federal bankruptcy court to force sci to liquidate and sci has 
asked that the request be denied sci said a hearing that had been

existing home sales dragged down by high 
interest rates slumped 46 percent last year to the lowest level 
since 1985 but were rebounding as the year ended a real estate 
trade group reported thursday 
sales of existing homes totaled 343 million units compared 
with 359 million in 1988 the strongest year of the decade 
according to the national association of realtors they reached 
321 million in 1985 after rising from the 1982 recessionyear 
total of 199 million 
sales ended the year totalling a seasonally adjusted annual rate 
of 355 million units in december down 11 percent from the 
previous month partly because of severe weather over much of the 
country the association said 
nevertheless the organizations chief economist john a 
tuccillo said that last year existing home sales totaled 
nearly 35 million units which would be the fourth consecutive 
year in which home sales reached or exceeded that level 
with the gradual decline in interest rates expected in 1990 
we should continue to see a healthy market this year he added 
home sales had plummeted by midyear as the housing industry was 
hammered by high mortgage interest rates forged by tight credit as 
the federal reserve sought to slow the economy and contain 
inflation 
sales which had reached a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 
355 million units last january plummeted to 321 million in may 
but the central bank began at midyear to gradually allow rates 
to drop and the pace of housing sales began to pick up 
despite the overall 1989 sales decline association president 
norman d flynn described last years pace as healthy and 
said last months resale pace indicates a stable market 
the 1989 median price of an existing home was 93100 up 43 
percent from 1988 the median in december was 92500 the median 
price means half of the homes cost more half less 
despite the severe weather the midwest posted the only sales 
increase in december rising 31 percent to 990000 units at an 
annual rate for the year the total was 926000 units 03 percent 
below the 1988 total 
tuccillo called the december improvement a signal that the 
market in the midwest is turning around and is expected to 
continue growing in the 1990s 
sales in the northeast totaled 570000 units on an annual basis 
down 34 percent from november for the year the resale pace was 
585000 units 131 percent below that of 1988 
the resale pace in the west was 600000 units down 63 percent 
from an eightmonth high in november the 1989 total was 605000 
units 518 percent below the 1988 total 
sales in the south slipped 35 percent in december to 138 
million units for 1989 resales totaled 131 million units 29 
percent below those of 1988

the federal aviation administration says a 
house report recommending a criminal probe into the firings of 
chicago airtraffic controllers was seriously flawed and 
repeated allegations already resolved by the courts 
the faas comments contained in a document filed with a federal 
workers board are the agencys first formal response since 
members of congress accused officials of lying and doctoring time 
sheets to justify the 1981 firings 
many of the reports findings are premised upon conjecture 
theory or speculation the faa said referring to a report 
released by a house public works and transportation subcommittee in 
september 
the report does not contain new evidence regarding the 
reliability of the timekeeping records and its conclusions are 
seriously flawed the agency said in the document which was 
obtained wednesday 
lawmakers spent three years investigating how faa officials at 
the chicago air route traffic control center in aurora ill 
prepared to defend the firings before the merit systems protection 
board 
in their report lawmakers concluded that attendance records 
were in such poor condition that officials decided to create 
documents to bolster the case against controllers who joined a 
nationwide strike 
the report also said faa officials may have committed perjury 
during appearances before the merit board which considers appeals 
from fired federal workers 
armed with the subcommittees report attorneys for the 
controllers are now asking the board to overturn the firings 
but the faa cites several reasons why the board should not 
reopen the case 
the allegations are not new the agency said the board in 1985 
and a federal appeals court in 1987 upheld the dismissals after 
considering similar complaints about time sheets 
the board cannot reopen a case that has been decided in court 
the subcommittee made errors and its report should not be 
considered 
the report not only ignored significant evidence and sworn 
testimony but revealed a significant misunderstanding as to the 
procedures which were used in the removal process the faa 
said 
faa officials acknowledged that some records had been amended 
but maintained the changes were made to ensure accuracy not to 
cheat controllers 
there was no scheme to alter and manufacture evidence which 
did not exist at the time of the strike and which was not prepared 
in the ordinary course of business the faa said 
scot imus staff director of the public works and transportation 
investigations subcommittee was not immediately available for 
comment thursday an aide said 
during their investigation members of the subcommittee said 
they were not judging the merits of the 1981 strike which led to 
the firings of approximately 450 controllers in chicago and 
thousands more across the country 
rather they said they were concerned with the actions of faa 
officials who were defending the firings before the mspb 
the subcommittee sent its report to the justice department 
suggesting possible criminal misconduct prosecutors however have 
asked the transportation department inspector general to review the 
findings

cable tv executives are seeing red over a 
promotional campaign that tells viewers free tv may one day be 
a thing of the past 
the executives asking the better business bureau to look into 
the series of 30second ads running this month on televisions 
stations nationwide that show future generations of youngsters 
expressing amazement that tv programs once could be had without 
paying a subscription fee a cable tv official said wednesday 
in one ad a little girl stands next to a blank tv screen at her 
grandmothers house turning the knobs in a vain attempt to get the 
set to work 
grandma how come we cant watch tv at your house the girl 
finally says as the message sometime in the future slips onto 
the screen 
honey i just cant afford the programs her grandmother 
answers 
dad said when he was a little boy tv was free is that true 
it sure was back in the 1990s we watched free tv all the 
time 
in another of the ads which are being produced and distributed 
to tv stations by the national association of broadcasters a 
little girl and her grandfather discuss a rabbit ears tv 
antenna shown in a vintage 1990 picture in an old photo album 
rabbit ears she asks 
yeah tv was free then me and your dad watched movies local 
news the super bowl right off the air the grandfather says 
an announcer ends the segment with free tv should never be 
just a memory call this station for more information 
cable tv executives say viewers are being duped broadcast 
television is not free they argue claiming that consumers 
eventually get soaked for the 27 billion that us businesses 
spend on tv advertising each year 
thats a little bit like telling people that all the rides at 
disneyland are free community antenna television association 
president stephen effros said in a complaining letter this week to 
the better business bureau the rides may be free but you have 
to pay to get into the park 
effros in his letter to ronald smithies vice president of the 
bureaus national advertising division in new york said the ads 
are false and misleading and are attempting to lull american 
consumers into the belief that they dont pay a dime for all of 
those free programs on their television sets 
he said the cost of tv advertising simply is passed on to 
consumers to the tune of about 298 per tv household whether we 
watch free tv or not 
nab spokesman walt wurfel on wednesday said effros was 
ignoring a number of studies over the years that make it clear 
that advertising is a service to consumers that adds competition 
and helps them make the wisest buy and tends to hold costs down 
smithies said his office if it determines that the cable group 
is raising a legitimate truth and accuracy question will contact 
nab officials and ask them to substantiate their free tv 
campaign claims 
negotiations then would take place he said in hopes that 
either the cable group will accept the ads as truthful or the 
broadcasters will change the ads 
the bbb which published the conclusions of its investigations 
has no legal enforcement power smithies said

phillips petroleum co reported a net 
loss of 255 million in the fourth quarter due largely to a 280 
million aftertax charge for its offshore california investments 
the company said thursday 
the writedown amounted to a loss of 104 a share in the final 
quarter of 1989 the company said 
for the same period a year earlier phillips had net income of 
135 million or 55 cents a share revenue totaled 303 billion 
up about 6 percent from 286 billion a year ago 
for the year phillips net income plunged 66 percent to 219 
million or 90 cents a share from 650 million or 272 a share 
in 1988 revenue totaled 1249 billion up 9 percent from 1149 
billion 
phillips chairman c j silas attributed the fourthquarter loss 
and the decline in yearly earnings mainly to the 280 million 
writedown for protracted delays in gaining regulatory approval to 
begin production of the point arguello field off the southern 
california coast 
texaco inc and chevron corp also have recently taken 
writedowns on the point arguello field 
silas said lower refining and marketing earnings stemming from 
higher crude oil costs and an oct 23 explosion that destroyed its 
houston chemical complex also had a negative impact on the 
companys results 
the explosion which killed 23 workers and injured more than 100 
others destroyed the companys us polyethylene capacity 
silas said chemicals earnings also declined in the fourth 
quarter and phillips paid a 50 million deductible for its business 
interruption insurance 
in keeping with the industry trend the companys exploration 
and production businesses posted higher earnings for the fourth 
quarter due to higher crude prices

futures prices of wheat and soybeans fell sharply 
thursday on the chicago board of trade in a late selloff linked to 
improving crop weather and slack demand for feed grains both 
domestically and abroad 
corn and oat futures also closed lower 
a flurry of grain and soybean buying late last year and earlier 
this month has filled delivery pipelines resulting in a demand 
lull 
ports in the soviet union are reportedly jammed with nearly 3 
million metric tons of imported grain waiting to be unloaded 
in the wheat market in particular the chance for doing any 
significant business is limited and were in a liquidating 
market said jerry zusel manager of trading floor operations for 
the brokerage balfour maclaine corp 
meanwhile a change this month to warmer weather patterns in the 
united states and europe has eased feedgrain consumption while 
recent precipitation in the nations midsection has raised soil 
moisture levels in winter wheat areas and replenished water 
supplies in the corn belt 
at the same time rains in the south american soybean belt have 
gotten the crop there off to a good start analysts said 
at the close of trading wheat futures were 2 cents to 6 cents 
lower with the contract for delivery in march at 385 a bushel 
corn was 1 cents to 2 cents lower with march at 239 a bushel 
oats were unchanged to 1 cents lower with march at 137 a

rising interest rates have made japans government 
bonds the most attractive paper on earth at the moment but 
forecasts of a mass exodus of funds from us investments may be 
overblown some experts say 
world markets were unnerved this week when a us offering of 
bonds to finance the savings and loan bailout did not attract the 
usual active interest among the japanese 
that incited fears in the united states because the japanese 
have been eager buyers of us government securities over the last 
several years helping to finance the federal budget deficit and 
hold down interest rates 
one broker joan anway of wi carrs tokyo office proclaimed 
japanese bonds the worlds most attractive but others say the 
factors adding to their allure could be temporary 
us analysts pinned the rise in japanese interest rates to 
inflation fears in japan where the rate more than doubled last 
year to 25 percent and where workers are seeking wage increases of 
6 perent 
for japanese investors the ability to obtain a high return 
without risk is bound to be remarkably attractive said seiichi 
kaneko manager of research in the international asset management 
division of asahi mutual life 
the yield on benchmark 10year japanese government bonds was 
quoted at 657 percent thursday compared to about 840 percent for 
a similar us treasury issue the japanese bond is up from about 
55 percent at the start of the year 
although the gap between the rates offered on us and japanese 
securities is definitely narrowing kaneko predicted there would 
not be any massive exodus of money from the us over the course 
of the year 
he said stock portfolio managers may liquidate some us 
holdings to take profits and offset recent losses in the tokyo 
stock market but after the new japanese fiscal year begins april 
1 kaneko expects managers to reinvest in the united states 
an indication of the extent to which japanese investors are 
fleeing the united states will come from the us treasury 
departments next refunding auction in early february 
kozo nogami manager of international securities investment for 
the largest japanese insurer nippon life said his firm still has 
a strong interest in us treasury bonds 
nogami said nippon life stayed out of tuesdays bond auction to 
finance the savings and loan bailout only because the term was 40 
years too long for us 
we havent sold any us bonds lately and well continue 
to buy he said 
but nogami added that with japanese interest rates rising 
japanese bonds are fairly attractive especially since they 
carry no currency exchange risk for japanese investors 
the central bank has raised its official discount rate the 
interest it charges commercial banks three times since last may 
bringing it to 425 percent from 25 percent in moves aimed at 
bolstering the yen and heading off inflation 
in turn the yield of government bonds calculated on the basis 
of price plus interest rate in secondary trading has shot up 
but world market turmoil and the political climate at home have 
kept japanese funds from being repatriated in large sums said 
richard c koo senior economist at the nomura research institute 
an arm of the nomura securities co 
money leaving us stocks and bonds appears to have been parked 
abroad leaving the yen vulnerable in the short run he said 
the markets are in such a mess that very few people are 
tempted to move funds home koo said 
he said that after japan holds elections next month and if the 
stock market settles down the foreign exchange market will 
respond strengthening the yen still broker anway believes funds 
already are flowing out of the united states into japan 
if people werent buying yen to get out of the us the 
dollar would be at 165 yen right now thats where it should be 
if everyone is really nervous about eastern europe she said 
the dollar closed in tokyo thursday at 14530 yen indicating no 
strong demand for dollars which investors need to make us 
investments 
american analysts said that if japanese investors do move money 
from the united states back home they may not be tempted to 
reenter the us market immediately 
if theyre going to leave because of the interest rate 
differential it could be difficult for them to come back without 
our rates moving higher said kevin flanagan a money market 
economist at dean witter reynolds inc in new york

when gillette co a household name in the 
shaving business said it would acquire part of the wilkinson sword 
blade and razor line last month it looked like a good deal 
too good if you ask the bush administration 
gillette already had an estimated 64 percent of the us blade 
and razor market and the companys plan to take over wilkinsons 
18 percent share set off alarms in the justice departments 
antitrust division alarms that were largely muffled during the 
reagan years 
analysts expect more bells to sound a year into george bushs 
presidency they say there are signs the government is taking a 
more aggressive stance on enforcing antitrust rules than the 
laissezfaire approach of the reagan administration 
i am clear in my mind that the bush administration will be 
less lenient less lax in merger enforcement said robert 
pitofsky a georgetown university law professor who described the 
reagan administration as more lenient about merger policy than 
anyone has been since the late 1930s 
lawrence j white a new york university professor who was chief 
economist in the justice departments antitrust division during 
ronald reagans first term agreed i just have a sense both from 
the rhetoric and the actions of bush administration officials 
that a tougher line is being taken 
the rhetoric white referred to was in the form of statements by 
james rill head of the justice departments antitrust division and 
janet steiger who chairs the federal trade commission 
rill in one of first declarations of bush administration 
antitrust policy said last november the fact is that antitrust 
is critical to the wellbeing of the american economy and plays a 
vital role in the governing process 
meanwhile ms steiger who appeared with rill at a harvard 
university lawyers conference said the ftc would be more vigilant 
in examining proposed mergers than it was during the reagan 
administration 
rills division is now challenging gillettes plan to buy 
wilkinsons blade and razor business outside of europe on the 
grounds the deal would reduce competition in this country it has 
asked both companies to submit information and documents about the 
planned acquisition by jan 29 
but not all observers believe theres been a big change in 
government policy under bush 
put the noise aside theres nothing substantive said sam 
pelzman an economics professor at the university of chicago 
graduate school of business however he added you hear that 
its toughening up its probably a signal 
pitofsky who was an ftc commissioner during the carter 
administration predicted that under bush there would be far more 
investigations of mergers than was the case a few years ago 
and challenges to the kinds of cases that sailed through the 
reagan administration 
the shift in policy comes as no surprise in fact it was 
anticipated in 1988 the year that takeover activity reached its 
peak analysts said then that many corporate acquirers wanted to 
get their deals done before the more permissive reagan 
administration left office 
the changed takeover environment with mergers and acquisitions 
slowed considerably by a virtual halt in junkbond financing may 
also make it easy for the administration to appear more activist 
but its not just heavily leveraged buyouts that the bush 
administration is looking at 
white the nyu professor pointed to the justice departments 
opposition last spring to eastern airlines plan to sell gates at 
philadelphia international airport and some of its routes to usair 
which already had a large presence in the philadelphia market 
he also noted the department had scotched plans by delta air 
lines and american airlines to merge their computer reservation 
systems 
it would have been a tougher call for the reagan 
administration to make white said 
the professors predicted that as time goes on the new attitude 
will become even more apparent 
it takes some time for a change of policy to work itself 
through the pipeline said pitofsky but he added most lawyers 
who work in this field believe that the rules are going to be 
tightened

unisys corp said thursday that w michael 
blumenthal its chairman and chief executive officer will retire 
in april to join the investment banking firm lazard freres amp co as 
a limited partner 
blumenthal 64 will remain chairman of the unisys board the 
company said 
meeting in detroit the companys board of directors chose 
president james a unruh 48 to assume the additional duties of 
chief executive officer after blumenthals retirement 
after almost two decades of managing major industrial 
companies and 10 years at burroughs and unisys the times has come 
for my longplanned retirement blumenthal said in a statement 
blumenthal who engineered burroughs corps 1986 takeover of 
sperry corp to form unisys was treasury secretary in the carter 
administration he indicated last year he planned to retire shortly 
at new yorkbased lazard freres blumenthal will serve as 
cochairman of a new international investment group his statement 
said 
unisys also announced its fourthquarter profit fell 84 percent 
as a weak us market offset strong international business growth 
and previously announced layoffs took a toll 
for the three months ended dec 31 the company reported net 
income of 34 million or 5 cents per fully diluted common share 
compared with 218 million or 105 a share in the same quarter 
of 1988 
revenue for the fourth quarter totaled 297 billion up 2 
percent from 291 billion a year earlier 
decreases in defense business and us commercial computer 
orders offset doubledigit growth in international orders unisys 
said from its headquarters here the us business was hurt 
temporarily by a 230 million restructuring charged against 
thirdquarter earnings that included the layoff of about 8000 
employees and consolidation of factories the company said 
but the restructuring helped the company return to profitability 
and a positive cash flow from operations after a 6482 million 
loss in the third quarter unisys said 
for all of 1989 unisys reported a loss of 6393 million or 
471 a share in 1988 the company reported a profit of 6806 
million or 327 per share 
revenue for the year rose 2 percent to 1010 billion from 994 
billion 
unisys said inventories were cut 216 million during the quarter 
to 18 billion bringing the years reduction to 723 million the 
company had set a goal of reducing inventories by 500 million 
after they rose 628 million in 1988 to 25 billion 
we are encouraged by the very early results from our 
fundamental cost structure initiatives blumenthal said in a 
statement our program is on schedule benefits are expected to 
accelerate gradually with the full impact to be realized in the 
latter part of this year 
unisys will seek to reduce debt by 600 million to 800 million 
in 1990 in part through the sale of nonstrategic and idle assets 
blumenthal said 
overall 1989 was a difficult and disappointing year he 
said we believe we have made progress against problems unique to 
unisys such as the high inventory position entering 1989 and we 
moved decisively to adapt to the rapidly emerging new economic 
model for the industry in the 1990s these actions will facilitate 
additional progress in the implementation of our strategic plans

the race to develop highdefinition television 
heated up thursday with the announcement that the us divisions of 
two european electronics giants have joined nbctv to research 
advanced tv systems 
philips consumer electronics co said it will join an existing 
research venture of thomson consumer electronics inc and nbc 
philips is part of nv philips of the netherlands while thomson is 
the us division of thomson sa of france 
the venture faces stiff competition from research efforts under 
way in japan and europe into highdefinition television which 
promises picture quality as crisp as photographs and crystalclear 
sound 
in addition zenith electronics corp the last major tv 
manufacturer in the united states has joined american telephone amp 
telegraph co to develop a hdtv system 
the new threeway alliance of philips thomson and nbc drew 
praise from several industry observers 
i think its a fairly wise competitive decision said pat 
hill hubbard a vice president of the american electronics 
association research is very costly in this field 
laura j lederman an analyst with the chicago investment firm 
duff amp phelps inc said the combination of manufacturers and 
broadcasters was critical 
if you have companies that build a set but you dont have 
broadcasters youre missing some of the pieces she said 
together philips and thomson control almost 40 percent of the 
us televisionset market philips makes the magnavox sylvania 
philco and philips brands while thomson owns the former general 
electric and rca lines 
nbc which is owned by general electric co has been 
cooperating with thomson for several years at the david sarnoff 
research center in princeton nj to develop advanced television 
systems 
nbc and thomson are working on a system called advanced 
compatible tv which would provide an improved picture on new 
widescreen tv sets while allowing continued use of conventional 
sets 
advanced compatible tv would require only minor lowcost 
adjustments to equipment at local tv stations thomson and nbc said 
philips on thursday endorsed the advanced compatible tv system 
we want us consumers to have access to advanced tv services 
as quickly as possible j peter bingham vice president of 
technology for philips consumer electronics said at a news 
conference at nbcs headquarters 
philips has been working on its own improvedtv systems in this 
country and said it would merge its efforts with those of nbc and 
thomson 
the consortium which invited other companies to join its 
effort said it hoped to have the advanced tv system operating and 
the sets on sale by 1993 the companies said they expected the sets 
would sell for 500 to 1000 
at the same time the consortium said it will pursue a true 
highdefinition tv system which would provide even sharper 
pictures 
the hdtv system being considered would require a reallocation of 
broadcasting signals by the federal communications commission since 
it would use the blank channels that now separate the channels in 
use in any one area 
the system would transmit an hdtv signal on one channel and a 
conventional signal on a second channel to meet an fcc requirement 
than any hdtv system not make conventional sets obsolete 
ms hubbard of the american electronics association said the 
trade group was pleased that the consortium joins three companies 
who are trying to keep the technology base in this country 
asked whether zenith would consider joining the consortium 
spokesman john taylor said were very pleased with the progress 
that we have been making in the development of our own system 
each of the groups developing highdefinition tv systems in the 
united states hopes its version is picked as the nations standard 
by the fcc which is scheduled to start testing proposed systems 
soon 
in addition to their us venture thomson and philips are 
involved in a european governmentindustry consortium to develop 
hdtv there 
japan has been researching hdtv for more than two decades and is 
considered by many experts to have the lead 
some experts say the nation that wins the hdtv race will have an 
enormous advantage in the broader electronics market

atampt reported sharply higher earnings thursday 
for the 1989 fourth quarter and the year calling it the best 
annual performance for the telephone giant since the breakup of its 
monopoly six years ago 
meanwhile nynex corp one of the baby bells spun off from 
american telephone amp telegraph co reported a loss for the fourth 
quarter and lower earnings for the year 
atampt said its improved results partly reflected a 67 billion 
charge it took in 1988 to modernize and streamline the nations 
biggest longdistance phone network that drastically lowered 
earnings that year 
atampt said it earned 705 million or 65 cents a share in the 
three months ended dec 31 vs a loss of 334 billion or the 
equivalent of 311 a share a year earlier quarterly revenue 
totaled 93 billion vs 921 billion 
for all of 1989 the company earned 270 billion or 250 a 
share on revenue of 361 billion in 1988 the company reported a 
loss of 167 billion or 155 a share on revenue of 352 
billion 
excluding the 1988 charge atampts 1988 results would have been 
593 million or 55 cents a share for the fourth quarter and 227 
billion or 211 a share for the year when compared with those 
results the companys 1989 fourth quarter and yearly earnings both 
rose 19 percent 
it was a year of excellent earnings our strongest since 
divestiture six years ago chairman robert e allen said in a 
statement it was a year in which atampt became a trimmer more 
responsive and more aggressive competitor 
allen said key events that shaped atampts performance last year 
included a reorganization into more focused business units more 
freedom from federal regulatory constraints and a trimming of the 
work force more than 21000 jobs were eliminated leaving the 
company with 283500 employees by yearend 
one industry analyst said atampt turned in improved results 
despite the increased competition it faces both in longdistance 
services and the telephone and computer equipment it sells 
the numbers were pretty good to me it indicates a continuing 
of their progression toward better earnings said pat jurczak of 
merrill lynch amp co jurczak said he believed atampt would increase 
its dividend in march 
nynex which provides local phone service in new england and new 
york state said it lost 437 million or 22 cent per share in 
the fourth quarter compared with a profit of 342 million or 
174 a share in the 1988 quarter 
revenue totaled 34 billion compared with 32 billion in the 
1988 quarter 
nynex blamed the loss in part on onetime charges totaling 325 
million after taxes it took in the quarter the charges related in 
part to a fourmonth strike against the company 
nynex chairman william ferguson also blamed the loss on a soft 
regional economy a downturn in the financial services industry and 
increased competition 
for the year nynex earned 808 million or 410 a share down 
from 132 billion or 663 a share in 1988 revenue totaled 
132 billion compared with 127 billion in 1988

for operations there said spokesman michael ascolese 
the company paid 176 million in taxes in 1988 and 241 million

after limited success pursuing a claim 
of worldwide conspiracy by giant japanese electronics firms a 
small scottsdale company has dusted off the allegation in a new 
federal lawsuit 
govideo inc which says it is counting on sales of its 
patented dualdeck videocassette recorder for survival filed the 
complaint wednesday in us district court in phoenix against six 
of the companies and their us subsidiaries 
it alleges that matsushita electric industrial co ltd and its 
panasonic division victor co of japan ltd and its jvc corp 
subsidiary sanyo electric co ltd sony corp nec corp sharp 
corp and sanyo electric co ltd tried to monopolize markets and 
prevent introduction of govideos vcr2 
the defendants did not immediately respond 
the new complaint expands on a conspiracy claim govideo first 
leveled in 1987 
the company plans to introduce the dualdeck vcr on march 28 
with a 995 suggested retail price 
in its first suit govideo alleged that the six japanese 
companies and others conspired to block marketing of the vcr2 
because they had been unable to develop a machine that has the same 
capabilities playing two movies at one time or recording from one 
tape to another 
the new suit repeats the allegations and alleges the formation 
of a cartel to control the consumerelectronics market including 
conventional vcrs digital audiotape recording equipment and 
highdefinition television 
since we filed our first lawsuit we have uncovered facts we 
believe suggest the existence of a conspiracy that is much more 
extensive than what we knew about or suspected when we started the 
first case said joseph m alioto an antitrust attorney for 
govideo 
alioto spent several weeks last year investigating and taking 
depositions from executives of japanese electronics manufacturers 
and others about their role in the alleged conspiracy against 
govideo 
some of the defendants have reached outofcourt settlements 
with govideo paying the company a total of 19 million the 
company has spent about 700000 on litigation

the layoffs are being blamed on slow sales high inventory and 
shrinking orders from auto dealers 
the twohour demonstration was organized by an ad hoc group made 
up mostly of uaw dissidents belonging to the socalled new 
directions movement 
one of new directions leaders don douglas president of uaw 
local 594 in pontiac mich called the closing of the jefferson 
avenue plant another broken promise 
gm plans to idle its lakewood assembly plant in atlanta in 
midmarch gm and chrysler also are trimming production rates at 
other plants in response to slumping sales 
ford so far has avoided largescale indefinite shutdowns by 
temporary plant closings and eliminating overtime in 1988 when 
ford was posting record profits the company was building up to 15 
percent of its new cars on overtime 
its going to be tough pete kelly president of uaw local 
160 at gms technical center in warren mich said of the coming 
negotiations which are expected to focus on the issue of job 
security 
i think there is as much dissension among salaried employees 
as among hourly kelly said at the rally 
each of the uaws contracts with the big three has language 
restricting plant closings mostly to those whose products arent 
selling chrysler said the dodge omni and plymouth horizon 
subcompact cars arent selling well enough to support the jefferson 
avenue plant and used that to justify the closing 
the uaw is challenging that claim and has suggested to chrysler 
that the omni and horizon continue to be built and sold only in 
areas where the model has proven to be a success 
many of thursday marchers came from gm or ford locals and 
waited for the end of the only shift at the plant to swell their 
ranks but the parade didnt grow appreciably after the workers 
inside the factory came outside 
one worker al jones of detroit said he wasnt sure what he 
would do after the closure of the plant where hes worked for 22 
years 
he and other members of uaw local 7 like other laidoff 
autoworkers are eligible for benefits from a variety of funds 
which could pay them as much as 95 percent of their normal wage

new studies show fees at checkcashing outlets 
nationwide continue to climb and a majority of americans support 
forcing banks to offer basic services to lowincome families 
consumer advocates and civil rights groups said thursday 
the organizations and a congressional backer said they will push 
for passage of legislation in the senate to require banks and 
savings and loans to provide low cost banking services to the 
working poor and recipients of government aid 
many lowincome and elderly persons cant even find a 
financial institution to cash their government checks said sen 
howard h metzenbaum dohio at a news conference to release the 
consumer studies 
however many institutions dont normally maintain the 
cash level that could handle that sort of a mandate said jim 
grohl spokesman for the league of savings instititutions 
banks are businesses said donald g ogilvie executive vice 
president of the american bankers association in a written 
statement they price their services in a competitive 
marketplace 
ogilvie said more than half the nations banks offer a basic 
banking account and a majority of them already will cash a 
government check for a noncustomer 
its a checkmate for the working poor said peggy miller a 
researcher for the consumer federation of america 
a cfa survey conducted between oct 3 and dec 1 1989 showed a 
general increase in the rates for cashing payroll checks and in the 
number of outlets entering the payroll checkcashing market 
a fourstate study released thursday by the us public interest 
research group showed only 14 percent of the financial 
institutions surveyed in new york new jersey oregon and 
california offer lowcost accounts 
only 31 percent of the banks surveyed would cash government 
checks for nondepositors 
the public interest research group collected data from 499 
financial institutions in the 1989 study 
metzenbaum argued that fees for basic services and minimum 
deposits and balances required by many institutions for 
checkcashing privileges are too high for lowincome elderly and 
minority people 
metzenbaums legislation suggests 2 be the minimum required 
balance for basic accounts at banks and savings and loans 
this countrys older and poorer residents are being denied 
something that many people take for granted the ability to have a 
basic bank account said francisco carranco a member of the 
board for the american association of retired persons a lobbying 
group for the elderly aarp backs metzenbaums legislation 
the national urban league the naacp and the association of 
community organizations for reform now joined the consumers groups 
in backing the senators proposals 
a gallup poll released thursday by aarp said that a majority of 
americans 73 percent of those surveyed believe financial 
institutions should offer some basic banking services to lowincome 
people 
sixtynine percent would support a law that required financial 
institutions to offer nofrills checking account to lowincome 
consumers at a price set by the government the aarp survey said 
the survey also found 17 percent thought the institutions should 
restrict their services to those most profitable for their business 
gallup conducted telephone interviews with 2008 adults from 
oct 918 1989 the margin of error for the gallup study was plus 
or minus 3 percent

the board of directors of campbell soup co 
said thursday it would maintain the food makers independence 
despite efforts by some members of campbells founding family to 
sell the company 
in a statement the board said it had given careful 
consideration to a move announced last month by an investor group 
that it would push to sell the entire company 
the dissident group which includes relatives of campbells late 
chairman john t dorrance jr said it was putting its 17 percent 
stake in the business up for sale and planned to seek a price per 
share significantly in excess of current market value 
but the companys board reaffirmed its intention to resist 
pressure to put campbell on the auction block 
we have concluded that now is not the time to pursue a sale or 
merger of the company the board said we are convinced that 
maintaining the companys independence is the superior means of 
maximizing the wealth of the companys shareholders over the long 
term 
the board holding its regular monthly meeting at the companys 
corporate headquarters in camden endorsed a plan designed to 
leverage the extensive brand power of campbell soup co and to 
deliver the financial results needed to build longterm shareholder 
wealth 
campbell provided no specific details david hackney a company 
spokesman declined to elaborate 
signs of disagreement within the dorrance family which has 
controlled campbell for nearly a century has fueled speculation 
that some major stockholders want to sell the company earlier this 
month campbell named david w johnson its new chief executive in 
part to squelch such rumors and analysts predicted the selection 
would bring stability to the company 
todays statement was an aim to quell takeover rumors and try 
to get the investment community to believe that mr johnson is 
going to be running this company for a long time and that hes 
going to be able to show dramatic improvement over the next couple 
of years said marvin b roffman of janney montgomery scott inc 
in philadelphia 
last week two branches of the dorrance family told the board 
they would not oppose a taxfree merger transaction dorrances 
three children who own about 31 percent of the companys 1296 
million outstanding shares have said they intend to hold their 
shares and keep the company independent

top partners at goldman sachs amp co the 
largest private partnership left on wall street have expressed 
concerns about the greed of some employees changing values within 
the firm and a failure to promote women and minorities a newspaper 
reported 
the views were expressed in a study surveying 11 current and 
former top partners of the firm a copy of which was obtained by 
the new york times the study included excerpts of executives 
comments but did not name the individuals making them the 
newspaper reported 
the study quoted one partner as saying in the old days when 
you became a partner you would feel free to give your wallet to 
another partner to hold for safekeeping i do not think it is that 
way today 
the partners also expressed frustration over the firms 
inability to keep some of its brightest stars the times reported 
they attributed the defections to factors like the 1987 stock 
market crash and the growth of small boutique investment firms that 
raid larger houses for talent the newspaper said 
one partner was quoted as saying weve seen a lot of change 
within the firm growth international business bringing in 
people from the outside etc its brought a lot of things with it 
things like more backbiting comments made about other people and 
other activities and they affect what its like to work here 
some partners also expressed concerns about the firms record of 
hiring women and minorities the newspaper said 
we have to do a better job of selection and need to get more 
people into the process one partner was quoted as saying 
weve hire too many blacks and females from places like harvard 
and stanford they dont turn out to be as successful as those from 
other schools like villanova who have struggled more and are more 
street smart 
one partner expressed doubt that the firm would add a second 
woman to its roster of 128 partners any time soon the times said 
the study believed to have taken several months and been 
completed in december 1988 was conducted by the delta consulting 
group a small consulting firm with assistance from two harvard 
business school professors john j gabarro and jay w lorsch the 
times said
