a quiet revolution is taking root behind 
the soft whir of sewing machines where bangladeshi women are finding 
alternatives to poverty early marriage and frequent childbirth 
in this underfed overpopulated disasterprone nation the 
garment industry has established itself as a success story both 
economically and socially 
nahar was 12 years old when her family arranged her marriage to a 
bicyclerickshaw puller who she said beat her by the age of 16 
she was a deserted wife with an infant son 
traditionally the only respectable options for a poor village 
girl like nahar would have been remarriage or becoming a maid the 
other possibilities in bangladeshs limited female labor market were 
husking rice pounding bricks and stones into gravel at construction 
sites or prostitution 
instead a few months after nahars husband cast her out in 1985 
a relative offered her a job in the fledgling garment industry 
today at the age of 20 she is a sewing machine operator at yk 
garments on elephant road in the center of dhaka and sends half her 
monthly salary of 900 takas about 28 home to her mother in the 
village to take care of her 5yearold son her annual salary of 
336 is more than double the countrys per capita annual income of 
160 
i feel im the happiest woman on earth she said no one 
beats me anymore almost every night im independent and i earn my 
own money 
like many bangladeshis she goes only by her first name nahar 
and does not use her last 
such independence is still rare for most bangladeshi women but 
it is a beginning and it is growing 
about 300000 women work in bangladeshs clothing factories 
making up 90 percent of the industrys work force the number of 
exportoriented clothing factories swelled from four in 1979 to 722 
in 1988 according to government statistics 
export earnings shot up from 500000 in 1979 to 450 million in 
1988 and now bring in 35 percent of the nations foreign exchange 
today bangladesh is the fifthlargest exporter of readymade 
clothing to the united states after hong kong south korea taiwan 
and china according to the us embassy 
but the garment industry could help in another problem area 
population growth if more women choose to work and marry later 
thereby reducing their childbearing years 
bangladesh is the worlds most densely populated land after the 
citystates of hong kong and singapore if its birth rate is not 
checked its population of 110 million will double within 35 years 
according to unicef 86 percent of the population already lives 
below the poverty level 
ayesha khatoon daughter of a landless peasant in bangladeshs 
northern rangpur district was 11 when she fled to dhaka in 1984 
because her parents planned to marry her off to a 16yearold boy 
i did not want the marriage she said the job at the 
garment factory has saved my life otherwise i would have ended up 
either being a maid at a rich mans house or who knows in a 
brothel 
ayesha and three of her coworkers at meghna garments industry 
ltd share a oneroom tinroofed apartment that in itself is a 
social breakthrough in a country where single women are expected to 
live with their families 
one of her roommates 25yearold khodeza said she left her 
husband two years ago because he insisted they have a fifth child 
the first four were girls and he wanted a son 
one night i thought and thought suddenly i decided that i 
cant take it anymore i must leave for a life of my own khodeza 
said 
the garment women have achieved a great social revolution in 
our conservative moslem society said sufia kamal a womens 
rights activist and leading poet they have done what many of us 
educated women have failed to achieve so far although the women are 
taking the jobs out of necessity they are also silently fighting 
against the social taboos

the newspaper in this middleoftheroad 
philadelphia suburb has drawn sharply divided opinions about its new 
type of human interest feature stories about dead pets 
they arent obituaries exactly according to staffers at the 
west chester daily local news daily circulation 40000 theyre 
more like stories of the pets lives and the people they lived with 
though it sounds like a dog days sort of thing to fill space 
in the paper of little real notice except maybe to the owners of 
the pets being remembered the project has proved controversial 
it seems to have hit some nerve said city editor david 
warner who tried the idea out first with a story about a rooster 
that flew the coop and died 
he expanded it last month into a weekly feature called pause to 
remember which now contains up to a halfdozen dead pet stories 
mostly about dogs some have suggested paws to remember 
many people think the stories are terrific and many think they 
are horrible and not serious journalism warner said there is 
nobody in between its either good or bad 
but the key point is that i like it and my boss editor james 
sneddon likes it and thats why its continuing and i think going 
ok 
the wall street journal even wrote about the new feature and got 
reaction from other journalists 
i have enough trouble finding space for the people irvin 
horowitz obituary editor for the new york times told the journal 
richard pearson who reports on important deaths for the washington 
post had a similar view 
eugene roberts president and executive editor of the 
philadelphia inquirer told the journal theres nothing like it in 
his newspaper and we have no plans to in the foreseeable future 
by which i mean in my lifetime 
warner insists what hes printing arent obituaries they are 
stories about pets and the people who loved them and thats what 
human interest items in newspapers are normally about so why is 
that wrong 
i understand that some people really feel strongly that the 
paper should be about more serious things warner said but we 
print a lot of less serious things like astrology charts comics 
advice to the lovelorn and comments about sex 
the pets profiled have included seagrave a dalmatian who liked 
to ride a fire truck molly a siberian husky who befriended an 
alzheimers disease victim butch a manx cat who played with cards 
in a hat or chipper a guinea pig who once was the best of show at 
a 4h club meet 
recently a story told about two dogs in one family teenier was 
blind and missie led her around like a seeing eye dog for a dog and 
both died within four months of each other warner said we 
thought that was interesting 
even in the papers newsroom there was disagreement 
sports writer dave spadaro said he felt the stories went 
against everything we were taught in journalism school it may be 
entertainment but people thought it hurt the papers credibility 
it was kind of a slap in the face of intelligence 
judith capar assistant city editor said she was skeptical in 
the beginning but has been pleasantly surprised at the outcome 
what we are doing are stories about peoples relationships with 
their pets and these stories are heartwarming and touching 
capar said 
the pet stories are written by james giuliano a parttime 
reporter 
he said he has found the assignment a real challenge and 
besides these arent hurting anyone

oregonians voted overwhelmingly tuesday to 
keep oregon logs at home to preserve mill jobs rather than allow 
them to be shipped overseas for premium prices 
with 8 percent of precincts reporting in unofficial returns 
measure 2 was passing 43263 or 92 percent to 3701 or 8 percent 
the measure will amend the state constitution to keep logs cut 
from stateowned forests at home for processing but congress would 
have to adopt enabling legislation before the export ban could go 
into effect 
this is the greatest present oregon could give me trying to get 
this bill through said sen bob packwood rore 
the measure also calls on congress to permanently ban the export 
of logs grown on national forests and other federal timberlands the 
bush administration has proposed lifting the annual ban on exporting 
federal logs to boost revenue by an estimated 200 million 
financing for the 800000 campaign came largely from 
nonexporting timber companies afraid that failure of the measure 
could have led to a lifting of the ban on federal log exports 
federal logs are already in short supply because of court 
injunctions barring timber sales in old growth forests that are 
critical to the survival of the rare northern spotted owl 
the measure drew no organized opposition but the pacific rim 
trade association complained that supporters have misled the public 
about the threat of state log exports to domestic mill jobs 
working through the association large log exporters such as 
weyerhaeuser co have concentrated their efforts on congress where 
they were successful last year in scuttling a bill to allow states 
to ban exports of logs grown on state lands 
the us forest service has estimated that federal exports could 
send an additional 1 billion board feet of raw timber from oregon 
and washington forests to japan china and korea 
about 13 billion board feet of oregon logs primarily cut on 
private lands were shipped last year out of a statewide harvest of 
9 billion board feet 
of the state forest harvest of 220 million board feet about half 
was exported

president bush and australian prime minister 
robert hawke have agreed to disagree over us grain subsidies 
officials said tuesday 
the dispute in which australia claims it is harmed by us 
subsidies to domestic growers surfaced as bush formally welcomed 
hawke to the white house 
it is precisely because of the depth and the maturity of our 
relationship that the difference of views can be faced openly 
and honestly for example on some trade matters particularly 
aspects of agricultural policy hawke said in his opening remarks 
i am quite confident that today we will be able to focus on 
ways to minimize if not entirely resolve such differences 
acting assistant secretary of state william clark said bush and 
hawke later agreed they would work through the ongoing trade 
liberalization talks in geneva to eliminate export subsidies such 
as the ones the united states has for grain under its export 
enhancement program 
the bush administration wants to discontinue export subsidies 
but only in the context of those multinational talks clark said 
adding that hawke is not making a demand right now that we do away 
with it 
hawke said monday that although damage to australia from the us 
policy has lessened over the past year there remains a danger 
that competitive export subsidization will again damage australia 
when grain surpluses reemerge 
clark said the united states doesnt believe its policy harms 
australia 
the grain flap also arose during vice president dan quayles 
recent visit to australia with australians contending the subsidy 
program has cut into their exports to other markets and gives the 
us growers an unfair price advantage 
while disagreeing on grain subsidies bush and hawke agreed on 
what stance to take toward to china 
hawke said he and bush had identical views deploring and 
condemning the barbarism in china but recognized that it is in 
their strategic and economic interest not to cut off ties or take 
measures that would reverse chinas economic reforms 
in an arrival ceremony bush said australians and americans share 
a pioneer heritage in the taming of two vast continents a 
heritage of democratic ideas and a heritage of common sacrifice in 
war and common efforts in peace 
hawke later told a news conference bush and agriculture secretary 
clayton yeutter reacted very positively to his proposal to 
strengthen the us hand at the geneva global trade talks by linking 
next years us farm legislation to progress toward the goal 
approved by both countries eventually eliminating farm subsidies 
the prime minister said he suggested that the 1990 us farm bill 
include a provision that in the event of a positive outcome to the 
uruguay round then the provisions of the legislation would in 
fact not come into effect 
both australia and america want to move toward abandoning farm 
subsidies so it makes sense to have within the us legislation 
a position which coincides with that intention hawke said 
and it would strengthen the bargaining position as you go into 
those negotiations which are going to be hard detailed and slogging 
between now and the end of 1990 he added 
hawke said he and bush both welcome unreservedly soviet 
president mikhail gorbachevs reform policies and that he backed 
bushs commitment that with appropriate caution he will pursue 
constructively every opportunity to build upon that attitude and 
that approach of president gorbachev 
bush and secretary of state james baker had an overwhelmingly 
positive response to australias initiative to organize regional 
machinery for consultation on economic problems among the pacific 
basin countries hawke said they agreed to work together in the 
coming weeks for a regional consensus looking toward a ministerial 
conference on it later this year he added 
the two countries disagreed however on ussuggested arms aid 
for the noncommunist resistance in cambodia and on australias 
decision to press for a total ban on oil drilling and mining in 
antarctica the prime minister said 
there are so many positive elements favoring prospects for a 
peaceful solution in cambodia that our judgment is that its 
better not to inject the element of lethal aid hawke said 
at a state dinner in his honor at the white house hawke praised 
bush as a shrewd leader who has built on the courage of the 
previous administration in promoting peace and moved to new 
frontiers offering the greatest opportunities for peace since the 
beginning of the nuclear age 
it takes courage it takes strength it takes leadership it 
takes boldness to have done those things hawke said 
bush said the united states has an abiding commitment to 
australia 
referring to the troubles in china he said that it was timely 
for the two leaders to meet and consult on issues affecting the 
region 
recent events in the asia pacific region showed that it is not 
enough to let a man buy what he wants he must be allowed to say 
what he believes bush said in apparent reference to the economic 
reforms in china contrasted with the brutal repression of 
prodemocracy demonstrations

with british prime minister margaret 
thatcher pledging to defend her countrys sovereign interests a 
rocky road still lies ahead for the 12nation european economic 
community as it moves toward closer economic and monetary union 
but in the view of many participants at this weeks eec summit 
mrs thatcher went a long way to shedding her image as the reluctant 
european adopting a more conciliatory approach and making 
concessions that just days ago seemed unthinkable 
i give thanks for mrs thatcher prime minister felipe 
gonzalez of spain who holds the communitys rotating presidency 
said at the end of the twoday summit tuesday 
if you had asked me a week ago i would not have believed that 
this would have been possible 
after hours of hard bargaining marked by sharp exchanges between 
mrs thatcher and president francois mitterrand of france the most 
enthusiastic supporter of monetary union the community agreed to 
introduce on july 1 1990 the initial stage of a program for closer 
economic ties 
mrs thatcher succeeded in blocking an automatic transition that 
would lead to a central bank and a single currency for the community 
but she did not kill off the currency and bank proposals which 
the two other largest community members of the community france and 
west germany regard as a key part of the drive toward a single 
market all trade barriers within the eec are to be dismantled in 
december 1992 
under the agreement that all the leaders endorsed an 
intergovernmental conference can be called by a simple majority any 
time after july 1990 to vote on changes to the communitys founding 
charter 
such changes would be needed to set up the single central banking 
system and currency 
mitterrand who takes over the eec presidency next month says he 
plans to call the intergovernmental conference next year likely 
forcing the showdown on close monetary integration 
community officials say the issue by one means or another is in 
play 
the movement has been started and i am tempted to say it is 
irreversible said jacques delors the head of the communitys 
executive body and head of a panel that wrote the report calling for 
a single currency and central bank 
i understand that political striptease contains a number of 
steps that are not automatically linked to each other added 
delors predicting further concessions from mrs thatcher 
he could be wrong 
mrs thatcher insists a common currency and central bank would 
strip the british parliament of sacrosanct rights to formulate 
financial policy and has suggested that in the end many other 
leaders would be equally reluctant to surrender these powers 
it takes away the power of the nationstate and takes away 
power which is at the heart of parliamentary democracy power over 
the budget power over the economy she said in a british 
television interview at the end of the conference 
but officials noted throughout madrid that she adopted a softer 
stance and she repeatedly stressed that britain is committed to 
europe 
her tone was substantially changed and in the community the 
tone can be as important as the substance said one eec official 
requesting anonymity now we all seem to be talking about the same 
sort of europe and providing we agree were living in the same sort 
of europe we can find a way to advance

a city councilman held on to his job 
tuesday despite efforts by a smokers rights group to snuff out his 
political career for sponsoring a tough antismoking ordinance 
unofficial results showed city councilor richard chapman winning 
all 22 consolidated precincts in his northeast albuquerque district 
city clerk eleanor sanchez said 3669 people voted against the 
recall while 1359 voted for it 
im ecstatic said chapman 41 in most senses the vote was 
much larger than me it was a vote for strong leadership in 
albuquerque it was a vote for health promotion 
dorothy jameson a packaday smoker who is a member of smokers 
rights of new mexico said she was disappointed but said her group 
will continue to fight the ordinance chapman sponsored which banned 
most indoor smoking in public places as of april 19 it carries a 
100 fine for violators 
angered by the ordinance smokers rights got enough petition 
signatures within chapmans district to force the recall election 
chapman a nonsmoker said the recall election had given him a 
chance to begin his reelection campaign a little early 
recognition was very high said chapman who will be up for 
reelection in october 1991 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
smokers rights contended the council violated the civil rights of 
thousands of smokers by prohibiting smoking in such areas as art 
galleries shopping malls libraries theaters taxis buses and 
public work places 
chapman said he sponsored the bill because polls showed most 
people in albuquerque favored smoking restrictions 
chapman who campaigned doortodoor against the recall often 
in temperatures near 100 degrees said he was surprised by the 
amount of publicity the recall generated 
i didnt have to introduce myself very much he said

sir alfred j ayer the british philosopher who 
helped popularize the notion that all philosophy can be reduced to 
linguistic analysis died tuesday after a lenghty respiratory 
illness at age 78 
ayers first book language truth and logic in 1936 was the 
first exposition of logical positivism in the english language 
the movement which ayer helped to develop in britain expounds 
the view that philosophical problems of the past can be reduced to 
linguistic analysis and that any idea that cannot in principle be 
verified by sensory observation is nonsensical 
ranging widely between the ideas of linguistic philosophers 
bertrand russell and ludwig wittgenstein it accepts that language 
must be strictly analyzed and redefined if there is any possibility 
of using it as an intelligible means of logical argument 
the philosophical school of linguistic analysts now dominates 
many british and american universities 
ayer also wrote the foundations of empirical knowledge in 
1940 and the problem of knowledge in 1956 as well as volumes of 
philosophical essays and histories of modern philosophy in which he 
extended the traditions of british empiricism

someone tied a yellow ribbon around the 
centuriesold treaty oak a bright reminder of peoples concern as 
workers hustled to help the historic tree survive a poisonous attack 
if theres power in prayer this trees going to be a real 
survivor said jack siebenthaler executive director of the 
american society of consulting arborists in florida 
a man suspected of poisoning the venerable tree may have done it 
as part of an occult ritual to cast a spell to protect a woman or 
because of a rivalry over a woman the austin americanstatesman 
reported today citing sources it did not identify 
police sgt john jones said investigators are looking for one 
person whom he did not identify jones has refused to discuss a 
motive for the poisoning 
legend has it that stephen f austin the father of texas signed 
a treaty with the indians under the 50foot trees branches 
but even though the handbook of texas a guidebook that includes 
state history says the story has little foundation visitors on 
tuesday continued to leave getwell messages in front of a ropedoff 
area that limits access to the tree 
siebenthaler was among state and national experts who developed a 
plan to help the tree in its struggle against the effects of the 
powerful herbicide velpar which was deposited in the roots police 
are investigating but know of no motive 
the plan to save the tree could be in place by weeks end said 
james houser head of the experts task force and chairman of the 
austin urban forestry board 
a sprinkler system will mist the trees foliage with water to 
control its temperature thus reducing stress from heat and an 
irrigation system will be set up houser said 
if soil samples taken tuesday show the herbicide remains in the 
ground despite efforts to remove it an underground drainage system 
could be constructed to flush it out 
what were trying to do is keep the tree functioning as well as 
it can said houser 
arthur costonis also a consultant with the arborist society and 
siebenthaler said they are hopeful for the trees chances 
it will be 1991 before experts will know if the tree will survive 
because of the potential for delayed stress siebenthaler said

would never go back

changes in the soviet union made him change his mind

civilized country and he considered it his duty to be part of the 
new era he said 
ashkenazy is music director of the royal philharmonic orchestra 
which he will take to moscow he said he will conduct two concerts 
at the moscow conservatoire and perform a mozart concerto in the 
first of them 
the russian people are freer to speak out and express 
themselves theres more honesty about their history which is an 
important foundation he said 
ashkenazy who will be 52 on july 6 left the soviet union in

to leave the crime fighting to michael keatons new version of the 
fictional character 
i guess if anyone should see it i should he said tuesday 
while in town for a return of his 1966 batman movie ive been too 
busy but im very curious 
west speaking in the same measured tones batman used while 
facing urban menaces said he would have liked to star in the new 
movie 
but i would not have been well casted he said they have a 
different vision people would expect the same thing batman was 
before lighthearted

hopelessly typecast he was shot out of cannons at circuses did 
avantgarde theater and wrote screenplays he also did lowbudget 
films such as as the happy hooker goes hollywood 
the turnaround began when the series became a hit in london 
during the mid1980s then came the new movie and word that batmans

environmentalists rejected a deal allowing 
timber to flow to northwest mills while protecting the habitat of 
the rare spotted owl but worked toward a deadline for compromise 
with the logging industry 
lawmakers hoped to attach a rider to a house spending bill to 
establish timber harvest levels for fiscal 1990 the bill is to be 
considered thursday 
i dont think the environmental community really wants to 
torpedo this agreement said rep les aucoin dore who met with 
conservationists tuesday i think cool heads can come together 
a compromise for saving old growth forest while opening some land 
to loggers was offered saturday at the socalled spotted owl summit 
of timber industry representatives environmentalists the seven 
members of oregons congressional delegation and gov neil 
goldschmidt 
the industry currently is blocked from logging many forest tracts 
by federal injunctions brought to protect the old growth forests 
the owls sole habitat 
we are talking about the extinction of a species and shouldnt 
act precipitously said andy kerr conservation director for the 
oregon natural resources council 
conservationists like misers may be hell to live with but we 
make great ancestors 
environmentalists said they supported many aspects of the 
compromise but had trouble getting information they needed from the 
us forest service 
yesterday we got three different answers to how much has been 
cut already and how much is available said larry tuttle oregon 
director of the wilderness society i think we need that kind of 
baseline information before anybody can proceed much further 
the timber industry warned that it could drop its initial 
approval of the deal if the cut level was reduced industry 
representatives claim that up to 18000 jobs could be lost unless 
timber tied up in court battles is freed 
the proposal called for allowing 8 billion board feet of timber 
to be harvested from national forests in oregon and washington and 1 
billion board feet from bureau of land management forests in oregon 
through sept 30 1990 some of the logged lands would be old growth 
forests but loggers would accept the wilderness society guidelines 
for protecting large blocs of the forest

energy secretary james d watkins is winning 
praise on capitol hill for opening the traditionally closed doors of 
federal nuclear weapons plants to independent safety checks by 
outside agencies 
watkins was touring an energy department waste dump in new mexico 
today and meeting with three governors to discuss a plan to give 
states a larger role in decisions about nuclear weapons production 
and waste management 
watkins on tuesday also renewed his attack on the departments 
past management of the weapons program 
the chickens have finally come home to roost watkins said 
after years of inattention to changing standards and demands 
regarding the environment safety and health 
managers failed to understand that weapons production goals can 
be met without sacrificing safety and protection of the environment 
he said 
watkins announced a series of steps he said will chart a new 
course for his department in ensuring that the 17 major weapons 
plants in 12 states comply with all state and federal environmental 
laws 
the weapons plants have been crippled in recent years by a series 
of mechanical failures safety lapses and delays in repair and 
construction plans the problems have left the united states for the 
first time without the ability to make tritium a radioactive gas 
needed to produce thermonuclear weapons 
watkins also announced he had abandoned hope of opening a nuclear 
waste dump in new mexico in september he said the waste isolation 
pilot plant near carlsbad required more review by experts outside 
the department he said he expected to open the plant next year but 
would not set a specific target date 
sen pete domenici rnm praised the decision 
we can only be encouraged by his intentions to make doe more 
credible in its operations especially by allowing outside entities 
more room to review doe operations he said 
watkins told a news conference at the energy department he is 
ordering talks with state governments on ways to let them 
independently check federal data on environmental issues and defense 
waste cleanup schedules for weapons plants within their borders 
the energy department worked out such a deal with colorado 
earlier this month after gov roy romer threatened to close the 
rocky flats weapons plant the fbi raided the plant on june 6 to 
search for evidence of illegal waste dumping 
watkins called the colorado accord a model for new doe 
cooperation with the states he was meeting today with romer new 
mexico gov garrey carruthers and gov cecil andrus of idaho 
continued operation of weapons plants in those three states are 
linked to the opening of the new mexico waste dump 
rep mike synar dokla who has urged watkins to postpone 
opening the waste dump because of doubts about its structural 
integrity said he was encouraged by watkins new emphasis on safety 
over weapons production 
admiral watkins statement is music to my ears synar 
said 
environmentalists were less enthusiastic 
we remain very skeptical of watkins because of his seeming 
unwillingness to have outside people involved in a meaningful way 
in decisions about the weapons plants said frances close hart who 
chairs the energy research foundation an environmental group based 
in columbia sc 
ms hart said watkins latest statements appear to indicate a 
change in approach but that it is too early to tell whether his 
plans will be put into action 
watkins said the department brought on much of the environmental 
and safety trouble itself by sticking to a tradition of secrecy and 
distrust of outside agencies 
the obstacles have been in our own house not with the 
states he said

us officials want to talk with zaire 
president mobutu sese seko about his peacemaking role in angola but 
may downplay his poor human rights record in the first visit by an 
african leader during the bush administration 
mobutu was arriving today for three days of talks with the bush 
administration he had meetings scheduled shortly after his arrival 
with secretary of state james a baker iii and defense secretary 
dick cheney 
on thursday mobutu is to have two hours of talks with president 
bush including a working lunch 
mobutus visit reflects the importance he holds for the conduct 
of american policy in africa 
briefing reporters about the visit a senior administration 
official said mobutus role in organizing last weeks peace 
conference in zaire between the angolan government and the 
usbacked unita rebels would be high on the agenda angola and 
unita signed a ceasefire that will end a 14year civil war and lead 
to talks on powersharing 
the us official speaking on condition of anonymity said 
american aid for unita much of which has been funneled through 
zaire will continue until a peace accord is signed 
the state department is hoping mobutus role in facilitating the 
agreement will deflect some of the congressional opposition to 
mobutu over his countrys human rights abuses 
we think zaires human rights record while being far from 
perfect has improved considerably in recent years said the 
official the number of political prisoners has declined prison 
conditions have improved and a human rights ministry has been 
established he said 
but sentiment in congress is strongly weighed against mobutu and 
rep ron dellums dcalif head of the black caucus has proposed 
halting us aid which is 60 million this year 
the house has already slashed the administrations request of 9 
million for military aid to zaire next year down to 3 million the 
money is intended for maintenance of ussupplied planes and 
equipment the official said 
us officials also want to ask mobutu for his assessment of 
recent contacts between the leftleaning government of mozambique 
and the violent renamo rebels he said 
assistant secretary of state herman cohen will travel to 
mozambiques capital of maputo in july to discuss possible us 
involvement in the peacemaking process there the official said 
i dont think hell mobutu play a role in mozambique said 
the official he has his hands full with angola and wed like 
him to devote full time to that 
also on the agenda are recent contacts between zaire and the 
apartheid government of south africa and the recent agreement zaire 
signed to undertake economic reforms in return for a loan from the 
international monetary fund

the pace of reform in poland and hungary is 
picking up even as president bush gets set to visit the two east 
european countries with assurance to moscow he will not try to 
overhaul their economies or pose a threat to the soviet union 
while bush on tuesday was advising soviet president mikhail s 
gorbachev not to get uptight about his trip to warsaw and 
budapest us officials said privately the second stage of 
elections in poland and a revamping of the communist party 
leadership in hungary have improved the trend to democracy 
there is uncertainty who will eventually become prime minister of 
poland however and the reshuffling in hungary may require a change 
in protocol on such delicate issues as who sits next to bush at 
dinner a fourman ruling body has sharply reduced the power of 
general secretary karoly grosz 
hell still see the same hungarians but in what order said 
a us official who assessed developments on the condition he would 
not be identified weve asked the hungarians 
in both countries bush will meet with prominent leaders of the 
opposition and he is bound to dwell on his session with lech 
walesa the leader of the polish trade union movement solidarity 
poland has now had two rounds of elections and solidarity has 
done well its won 99 of 100 senate seats and the union has won 
all of the contested races for the lower house 
a president is to be chosen by july 18 bush will be in warsaw 
and gdansk the baltic seaport where solidarity was launched july 
911 
there may be a caretaker government for a while and its not 
clear if wojciech jaruzelski will wind up wearing the twin hats of 
president and communist party chief 
there is a lot of nervousness among the poles because nobody 
knows how all of this is going to work out said another us 
official who also insisted on anonymity but we know the way the 
trend is running and we welcome the trend 
in hungary he said the reshuffling at the top of the party 
doesnt change things much 
democratic change is so far advanced it is conceivable a majority 
of the hungarian parliament will be noncommunist in the next two to 
five years a state department official told a house foreign affairs 
subcommittee 
the official curtis w kamman deputy assistant secretary for 
european affairs said the administration does not believe house 
legislation to give hungary a fiveyear exemption from economic and 
trade restrictions is needed 
he explained that hungary has removed practically all 
restrictions on the ability of its citizens to travel abroad or to 
emigrate at will the objective of the restrictions 
bush will be in budapest july 1113 just before he goes to paris 
for an annual economic summit meeting with the leaders of britain 
canada france italy japan and west germany 
at a news conference tuesday bush said he will not exhort the 
polish and hungarian people to take actions that might invite 
repression 
i want to see a much more open europe he said and i think 
that the importance of the visit is along that line its not going 
to be that were going to solve the problem of the hungarian economy 
or the polish economy 
bush took a relaxed view of ussoviet competition and 
gorbachevs own travels to the west for instance bush said it was 
a good thing that the soviet leader went to west germany earlier 
this month 
its a good thing for him to go to western europe and its a 
good thing for the president of the united states to go to eastern 
europe he said i want to see us move beyond containment 
bush said he will bring an economic package to poland but he 
stressed us support for the polish economy will require further 
reforms there 
in any event bush said in regard to both poland and hungary that 
being there is the significant thing it is important that the 
united states show its interest in these countries that are 
undergoing change you dont want to overexhort you dont want to 
overpromise you dont want to rally people to levels of political 
activity that might cause repression 
at the same time bush said the trip is not designed to send a 
signal to moscow 
i would not expect them to be uptight about it bush said 
mr gorbachev goes to western europe and is wellreceived and i 
will go to eastern europe and i will be wellreceived

advisers resigned from his gubernatorial campaign over their ties to 
the growing scandal of influence peddling within a federal housing 
agency

of housing and urban development by prominent republicans 
stone and his firm black manafort stone and kelly are 
resigning as courters political strategists stevens will step down 
as courters media adviser

recent news coverage about his firms ties to the hud scandal 
stone said the scandal would distract voters from the courter 
campaigns attempts to spotlight his democratic opponent rep james 
florio as the political boss of camden county we are intent on 
preventing jim florio and the democrats from using my association 
with the campaign as a club against jim courter stevens said 
stone stevens and the courter camp have consistently and curtly 
rejected any suggestion of ties to improper activities within hud 
but the controversy has been dogging the campaign 
stones firm received more than 300000 in fees under a nobid 
contract for a moderateincome housing project in cumberland county 
in southern new jersey paul manafort who handled the project 
described his own involvement as influence peddling

icelands womenonly party complains 
its being treated like little flowers with little ideas but a 
rival woman lawmaker says the feminists are not taking politics 
seriously and degrading parliament 
two years ago the womens list the worlds first allfemale 
party captured six seats in the 63member althing or parliament 
and for a while it looked like a potential powerbroker 
but today says womens list lawmaker thorhildur thorleifsdottir 
icelands maledominated society and especially its media have 
formed a very great coalition to silence us 
male and female opponents say the womens list wont be taken 
seriously unless it plays politics icelandicstyle which the 
womens list refuses to do saying it means surrender to a system 
designed and run by men 
the kvennalist icelandic for womens list is radical 
antinuclear and opposes icelands membership in nato 
this puts it outside the centrist political mainstream as does 
its dogged insistence on being nonestablishment it has no 
hierarchy or leadership operates by consensus rotates members in 
and out of parliament and has an eightyear limit on being a 
lawmaker 
the womens list sees these policies as strengths political 
rivals and western diplomats say they are weaknesses 
hierarchy is very much a male thing women try to run their 
homes without a hierarchy and we see this country as one large 
family said sigridur duna kristmundsdottir a kvennalist founder 
who served in parliament for four years 
we are very concerned about not having power accumulate in a 
few hands she said 
ms thorleifsdottir added we made it clear in the election 
that when you vote for our list you vote for ideas not for people 
but of course that goes against all the rules its a threat to 
the system 
opponents counter that seasoned recognized leaders are needed if 
the womens list wants to share power in a coalition the 
traditional style of government in this north atlantic island nation 
of 250000 people 
gudrun helgadottir the first female president of the althing 
the worlds oldest parliament said rotating members was absurd 
parliament is not meant to be some sort of schooling system 
she complained i think it degrades the parliament 
mrs helgadottir a member of the leftwing peoples alliance 
that belongs to the current threeparty centerleft governing 
coalition said the need for consensus keeps the womens list out of 
government 
such a movement can never be homogeneous enough to take 
political stands she said 
but ms kristmundsdottir said the womens list has stayed out of 
coalitions because other parties would not meet its minimum demands 
i would be happy if we have 1516 percent of the vote in the 
next election which would give us nine or 10 mps and make us 
seriously consider entering a coalition group she said 
iceland gave women the vote before other european countries and 
since 1980 it has had a woman president vigdis finnbogadottir 
the womens list was founded in 1981 by a dozen women who saw the 
salary gap between men and women widening despite a 1976 equal 
rights law 
it won three althing seats in the election of 1985 a year in 
which icelandic women celebrated the united nations decade of the 
woman with a oneday strike that paralyzed the country 
it won nearly 11 percent of the vote in the 1987 election 
doubling its seats a year later it had 28 percent in an opinion 
poll 
that fell to 12 percent in a poll last april but even opponents 
concede that the womens list is a fascinating phenonemon that has 
inspired women elsewhere 
this is not supposed to be an icelandic phenomenon said ms 
kristmundsdottir this is valid for women everywhere else if they 
think so themselves 
she said denmark has established a womens party that expects to 
run in the next election and women from canada norway the 
netherlands the united states and west germany have expressed 
interest 
womens list lawmakers complain that theyre viewed as little 
flowers ms thorleifsdottir a theater director and mother of 
five said too many powerful men believe the party has nice little 
ideas not worth pursuing 
this is a great danger to the world because it shows that 
men are not interested in any new ideas she said obviously we 
are going to have to find some way to break small holes in this 
wall 
ms thorleifsdottir said women still earn just 53 percent as much 
as men but the party claims credit for getting housework valued as 
work experience and maternity leave extended from three to six

an agriculture department analyst says the 
oncetroubled us sheep industry has settled into a profitmaking 
venture that no longer shows signs of the traumatic declines of 
decades past 
the number of sheep has plummeted from a high of 56 million in 
1942 to fewer than 11 million today but economist richard stillman 
says that since about 1980 the us inventory has exhibited 
cyclical fluctuations that are typical of most livestock 
production 
a shrinking group of people with a taste for lamb largely 
caused the decline he said growth in competing manmade fibers 
and shortages of skilled shepherds also contributed 
stillman added contrary to popular opinion lamb imports have 
not contributed to the decline in domestic production imports and 
production have declined in tandem 
the good news is that as a specialized industry raising sheep 
continues to be profitable he said the downside to a small 
industry is that the efficiencies of a larger scale in slaughter and 
distribution cannot be fully exploited and both producers and 
consumers bear the brunt of higher processing and distribution 
costs 
most sheep production is concentrated in the drier areas of 17 
western states where raising sheep or cattle is often the only 
viable use of the land stillman said texas with 18 percent of the 
inventory on jan 1 is the largest producer colorado however 
turns out the most feedlot sheep and lambs for the slaughter market 
writing in the july issue of agricultural outlook magazine 
stillman said the sheep industry has not attracted new producers 
although studies by the departments economic research service show 
sheep production has been profitable in twice as many years recently 
as cattle 
part of that profitability has been due to the federal wool 
program which provides subsidies to producers when wool market 
prices are down 
disease and predator problems translate into a higher death 
rate for sheep than for other livestock stillman said also 
the shepherds lonely existence makes it difficult to attract 
skilled labor moreover sheep require twice the labor of cattle for 
the same enterprise base 
in response to some of these problems producers have increased 
the average yield of sheep through genetic selection and feedlot 
finishing the dressed weight of lambs was raised to 63 pounds in 
1988 from an average of 51 pounds in 1970 
thus stillman said producers can reduce the sizes of their 
breeding herds and still maintain the same level of production 
but only a small segment of the population eats lamb or mutton 
consumption is expected to average about 14 pounds per person this 
year compared with beef at about 71 pounds pork at 63 and 
broilers at 65 
the sheep industry has been trying to attract new customers 
through educational campaigns on how to buy and prepare lamb 
but stillman said the industry still faces the prospect of 
boosting consumption of a relatively expensive red meat at a time 
when all red meats are losing market share to poultry 
some of the exporting countries are providing innovations 
shipping fresh lamb by air instead of freezing and sending it by 
ship to us markets australia leads in fresh lamb sales to the 
united states and new zealand is shipping live lambs to oregon 
this year 27000 landed in may and another shipment of about 
27000 is to follow stillman said however live lamb imports 
are still small compared with annual domestic slaughter of about 53 
million head

the soviet union has bought an additional 
400000 metric tons of us wheat for delivery this year under the 
longterm grain agreement between the two countries 
agriculture department officials said tuesday that the sale by 
unidentified private exporters was a straight commercial 
transaction and did not involve subsidies under the departments 
export enhancement program 
the soviet union has bought more than 42 millions of tons of 
wheat under eep arrangements for 198889 delivery the most recent 
being 96000 tons announced on june 23 
although the soviets had virtually used up the previous eep 
allocation a new deal for an additional 15 million tons of wheat 
was announced may 2 officials said moscow still has 814200 tons 
available under the program 
a metric ton is about 2205 pounds and is equal to 367 bushels 
of wheat according to the latest usda fiveday average the price 
of wheat has been 385 per bushel meaning the latest sale of 
approximately 147 million bushels could have a farm value of around 
56 million 
under eep arrangements private exporters can sell us 
commodities at reduced prices in order to meet foreign competition 
in selected overseas markets and then collect free government 
surpluses of grain or other commodities as bonuses or subsidies 
the sale announced tuesday boosted to more than 212 million tons 
the amount of grain moscow has bought for delivery in the sixth year 
of the agreement which began last oct 1 of that corn makes up 
nearly 162 million tons and wheat more than 5 million tons 
in addition the soviets have bought 442500 tons of soybeans 
135 million tons of soybean meal and more than 1 million tons of 
grain sorghum

the district of columbia council on tuesday 
gave preliminary approval to a bill to make handgun manufacturers 
and distributors financially liable forinjuries or deaths caused in 
shootings 
the 84 vote was on legislation to allow shooting victims and the 
families of homicide victims to recover monetary damages from the 
manufacturer of a gun used in a shooting regardless of who was at 
fault if given final approval it could be the first such law in 
the united states 
manufacturers around the country generally have not been held 
responsible by the courts for gun damage under existing laws the 
new legislation could expose them to hundreds of new lawsuits 
council members said they hope the measure will reduce the 
availability of firearms in the district as well as around the 
country 
this is not pr said council member william p lightfoot 
dat large a proponent of the legislation if you make a 
dangerous weapon were going to hold you responsible any time it is 
used 
richard r atkinson jr a member of the board of directors of 
the national rifle association and president of the district of 
columbia firearms association said the councils action could have 
a negative impact on home rule by giving its federal opponents 
additional ammunition with which to attack the districts local 
government 
i think if the city council continues with this kind of 
meddling in other states affairs it will go down in history as the 
city council that lost home rule he said 
during the council debate over the legislation tuesday opponents 
of the handgun bill raised similar concerns 
council member betty ann kane who voted against the bill called 
it a kneejerk response to the violence on the street she said 
she doesnt understand why we are taking away individual 
responsibility for the commission of shooting crimes

congress is trying to block the route which 
former reagan administration aide lyn nofziger used to win a 
reversal of his conviction for illegal lobbying 
rep barney frank said tuesday the house judiciary committee will 
consider amending the ethics in government act to revise provisions 
nofziger used successfully in appealing his 1988 conviction 
we saw it as a potential loophole said frank a 
massachusetts democrat 
in a 21 decision tuesday the us circuit court of appeals said 
nofzigers conviction must be set aside because it wasnt based on a 
finding that he had knowledge of each element of the offense 
he was convicted feb 11 1988 of three counts of illegally 
lobbying top presidential aides on behalf of private clients after 
he left the white house one year into the reagan administration the 
clients were scandalplagued wedtech corp a maritime engineers 
union and the manufacturer of the air forces a10 antitank plane 
the appeals court said tuesday that in order for a conviction to 
be valid the prosecution must demonstrate that nofziger knew the 
matters on which he lobbied were already of direct and substantial 
interest to the white house 
the proposed amendment would eliminate the provision requiring 
knowledge of each element of the offense said frank chairman of 
the house subcommittee on administrative law congress passed a 
similar measure last year but it was vetoed by president reagan 
independent counsel james mckay who prosecuted nofziger said he 
will consider appealing he could seek a review by the federal 
appeals court in washington or by the supreme court 
a fiveyear statute of limitations could make it impossible to 
bring revised criminal charges 
his conviction was reversed in a decision written by us circuit 
court of appeals judge james buckley joined by judge stephen 
williams both reagan appointees the third member of the panel and 
lone dissenter was judge harry edwards a carter administration 
appointee 
nofziger the white house political director in 1981 began 
lobbying his former colleagues within months of leaving the 
government he said he was trying to stimulate their interest in 
various matters which would not be a violation of the oneyear ban 
on lobbying an exemployees former government agency 
the case against nofziger was the first major test of the 
revolvingdoor provisions of the ethics in government act 
i dont think i am part of any revolvingdoor syndrome said 
nofziger people lobby in this town the main industry in this 
town besides government is lobbying 
asked whether he thought he got off on a legal technicality 
nofziger said absolutely no i think they came after me on a 
technicality 
nofziger said he was pleased by the decision i think i was 
innocent from the beginning i still think i am innocent he said 
the court ruling won praise from president bush and other 
highlevel administration officials 
bush asked about the ruling at a state dinner tuesday night 
honoring australian prime minister robert hawke smiled broadly and 
said only im always glad when somebody is found not guilty of 
something 
secretary of state james a baker iii called the decision 
terrific adding theres no doubt in my mind and never has 
been that he did not intend to break the law 
bush said he had not spoken with nofziger since the decision but 
chief of staff john sununu said he called nofziger to congratulate 
him 
i kind of felt that it was important that he know that at least 
some of his old friends hadnt forgotten him sununu added 
nofziger had been sentenced to 90 days in prison and fined 
30000 he said that defending himself cost over 15 million in 
legal fees and possibly more than that in lost income

when the supreme court upheld flag burning as a 
protected form of free speech george bush heard fire bells and was 
back on the campaign trail once more 
as bush has been fond of saying quoting baseball philosopher 
yogi berra it seemed like deja vu all over again 
bush used the flag in particular massachusetts gov michael 
dukakis veto of a state pledgeofallegiance bill to great 
political effect in 1988 
now hes mounting yet another campaign in defense of the flag 
one to amend the constitution to set aside last weeks 54 supreme 
court decision and forbid flagdesecration at the federal level 
amending the constitution is extremely difficult in the 200year 
history of the document thousands of amendments have been advanced 
but only 26 ratified 
however difficult the process the call for a proflag amendment 
was politically an easy one it doesnt increase the federal 
deficit doesnt affect federal services doesnt cost the president 
political support doesnt alienate most special interests and it 
once again puts democrats on the defensive 
it was a safe campaign tactic for bush a year ago and a safe 
presidential pronouncement for him now 
many democrats still smarting from bushs 1988 attack on dukakis 
on the flag issue and their own failure to respond quickly enough 
joined congressional republicans in denouncing the courts decision 
last week but they were treading with extreme wariness on bushs 
proposal 
house speaker thomas s foley dwash balked when reporters 
suggested that democratic failure to endorse bushs call for a 
constitutional amendment could give republicans a partisan issue 
im sure people will play politics with any emotional issue 
playing the most cynical politics for the most base and crass 
political purposes foley said 
such partisanship would be reprehensible and disgusting 
foley continued as if he hadnt gotten the point across im 
condemning those who are doing it 
just who might that be foley didnt say 
bush was asked about his own partisan use of the flag issue at a 
hastily called news conference on tuesday held a day after he told 
the new york times in an interview he was undecided on how best to 
respond to last weeks court order and had asked aides to study the 
issue for him 
given his renewed concern about proper reverence for the 
flag bush was asked did he think it helped the situation for him 
or any other politician to make the flag an instrument of 
partisan politics as it was in your campaign 
i dont view that as partisanship bush responded i think 
respect for the flag transcends political party and i think what 
ive said here is american it isnt republican or democrat it 
isnt liberal or conservative 
asked whether he disputed that he used the flag for the purpose 
of advancing his political campaign last year bush replied 
candidly everything i did last year was for the purpose of 
everything i did politically advancing my election 
but i didnt put it on the basis that republicans are for the 
flag and democrats are not 
bushs comments sounded similar to his response during the 
campaign when asked whether he was challenging dukakis patriotism 
no not his patriotism bush insisted he was only questioning the 
democrats judgment 
at issue was a state law requiring massachusetts public school 
teachers to lead their classes in the pledge of allegiance dukakis 
vetoed it claiming that his legal advisers had said the measure was 
unconstitutional 
had he been governor of massachusetts bush said during the 
campaign he would have figured out a way to make the law stick 
he paid a wellpublicized visit to a flag factory in new jersey 
to drive home his message and throughout the campaign surrounded 
himself with rows upon rows of waving flags 
last wednesdays supreme court decision in which two 
conservative members of the court joined the majority gave bush an 
easy chance to do just what he condemned dukakis for failing to do 
find a way to make a flag law stick 
civil liberties groups blasted the move it should come as no 
surprise that the president who made the pledge of allegiance the 
centerpiece of his campaign is now willing to make flagburning his 
chief domestic initiative it is triumph of politics over policy 
said arthur j kropp president of people for the american way 
but bushs stand was warmly received by republicans and 
conservative democrats in congress 
and the president himself had no difficulty defending his 
outspokenness on the flag issue while remaining silent on other 
recent constitutional issues including court decisions making it 
harder for minorities to bring discrimination suits against 
employers 
ive got to confess i do feel viscerally about burning the 
american flag he said

federal regulators and members of congress are 
threatening to trim the profits of the nations biggest banks if 
they continue resisting voluntary reductions in debt owed them 
by third world countries 
the federal reserve is the latest to put the pressure on telling 
a house subcommittee it will order the banks to set aside more 
reserves to cover possible losses from the loans unless there is 
progress soon on treasury secretary nicholas bradys debt reduction 
plan 
without further cooperation between borrowers and lenders 
credit quality will continue to deteriorate as more countries become 
unable or unwilling to service their bank debts william taylor 
the feds director of banking supervision and regulation said 
tuesday 
in such an event further significant increases in reserves 
will clearly be required taylor told the house banking 
subcommittee on international development finance trade and 
monetary policy 
the panels chairman del walter fauntroy ddc and rep john 
lafalce dny have introduced separate bills that would require 
banks to double their reserves for third world loan losses such a 
move could cut the earnings of those banks by 20 billion 
if there is one lesson we have learned from the savings and 
loan crisis its that we must require adequate reserves on 
highrisk loans said lafalce 
in addition fauntroy would prohibit banks that do not 
participate in the brady plan from taking any tax losses on the 
loans if and when they are declared in default 
us commercial banks now hold 707 billion of some 340 billion 
in troubled third world loans but have set aside reserves of only 
23 billion to cover them most of it in the past two years 
the general accounting office said tuesday that based on the 
discounted value of the loans regulators should be requiring 
reserves of nearly 50 billion instead of the 49 billion now 
mandated 
allan mendelowitz director of trade and finance issues for the 
gao said the federal reserve and the comptroller of the currency 
now require reserves on only about 16 percent of the loans owed by 
countries with problems servicing their debt 
and no reserves are required for covering possible losses on a 
total of 595 billion of the debt carrying a high level of risk or 
in arrears he said the gao estimated the value of those loans if 
sold on the secondary market at only 236 billion 
bradys plan calls for reducing third world debt by 20 percent 
it asks private banks to effectively forgive a portion of the loans 
in exchange for promises that governmentbacked international 
lending agencies such as the world bank will guarantee interest 
payments on the remaining balances 
but in its first major test with mexico the plan has run into 
stiff resistance among commercial banks 
after adopting widescale austerity programs in the wake of 
falling oil prices demanded by lenders mexico is now seeking a 55 
percent reduction in the nearly 70 billion it owes private 
creditors 
the commercial banks countered that plea with an offer of a 15 
percent reduction talks between the two parties are continuing 
but without a general agreement by july 14 when the paris 
economic summit of major industrialized nations opens 
administration officials fear bradys debt reduction plan like 
that of his predecessor james a baker iii may come unraveled 
debtridden poor countries claim a 20 percent reduction is not 
enough to allow them to lift up their economies 
and other lender nations are skeptical at the plans ultimate 
reliance upon taxpayer assistance through the world bank and 
international monetary fund to guarantee private banks against 
further losses 
time is running short and uncertainties appear to be 
increasing said taylor

the state department has done too little to 
recruit and promote minorities and white women are still finding 
the road to advancement is steep a congressional report says 
a general accounting office study of the departments foreign 
service found that despite advances for minorities and white women 
the numbers are low when compared to the civilian labor force 
the state department increased minority representation in the 
foreign service from 7 percent in 1981 to 11 percent in 1987 said 
the study required by the foreign service authorization act the 
percentage of white women has remained essentially unchanged at 
about 24 percent 
minorities and women are still significantly under represented 
at senior levels of the foreign service said the report released 
tuesday 
the report produced no immediate comment from the state 
department which is already under orders from a federal court in 
washington to offer new positions to 600 women and to revamp its 
entrance examination 
although it doesnt mention the lawsuit the report echoes its 
complaints 
as of september 1987 6166 of the state departments 9439 
foreign service employees were white men the study said white 
women accounted for 2232 of the employees there were also 508 
black men and women 324 hispanics 42 american indians or alaskan 
natives and 159 asianamericans or pacific islanders the study 
said 
the study noted that white males dominated the political and 
economic jobs both considered more prestigious women of all 
backgrounds tended to work as consular officers people who work on 
visas help americans overseas and issue passports most minority 
males become administrative officers the people in charge of 
budgets maintenance and supplies the study said 
the study found a particular problem at the midlevel foreign 
service for white women saying there should be 771 women in those 
positions while in fact there are 311 
if the promotion rates of white women continue at the current 
levels it could be several years before the state department 
achieves full representation at these levels the study said 
the state department stopped hiring white women from outside into 
the midlevel positions in 1987 
the study noted that states recruiting efforts have not 
increased the number of minorities taking the foreign service 
examination for officer positions and it said minority men and 
women pass the examination at onefourth the rate of white men 
it suggested more innovative approaches including a more active 
presence on college campuses 
the state department in a letter that was part of the gao 
report said it would alter its fiveyear affirmative action plan to 
come up with specific goals and timetables for the hiring and 
advancement of minorities 
it said its revamping of the examination would ensure that there 
is no bias against women or minorities 
charles schmitz vice president of the 20000member american 
foreign service association said the problem will be to come up 
with a test that doesnt discriminate or show cultural bias 
but assures that the people who represent the united states have a 
shared body of knowledge

the bush administration is threatening to veto 
and key senators are promising to slash an ambitious drought relief 
package approved by the house that would send more than 900 million 
to farmers facing crop losses from severe weather 
agriculture secretary clayton yeutter warned he would recommend a 
veto of the house plan unless the senate alters the measure which 
he says is too expensive and covers too many crops 
the house passed the legislation by voice vote tuesday hoping to 
speed assistance to winter wheat farmers in great plains states 
where dry weather is expected to sharply reduce this summers 
harvests and to also bring relief to farmers of other crops 
supporters estimate the price tag will be about 975 million and 
that the money could be covered by expected savings in federal 
commodity subsidies which should be lower because market prices for 
droughtshriveled wheat harvests are expected to rise 
yeutter estimated the house bill could cost up to 15 billion 
he said the administration would support drought assistance limited 
to winter wheat 
senate republican leader bob dole of kansas said he would work 
for a tighter plan calling the house bill a lavish multicrop 
multiperil multibucks bailout for over 600 crops 
democratic and republican leaders in the senate agriculture 
committee which is schedule to take up drought relief on july 19 
have said they favor targeting payments to winter wheat growers 
the drought bill introduced in the senate would limit relief to 
this years crops planted in 1988 primarily winter wheat the 
house would set up assistance for crops planted this year although 
damage to those harvests is not yet known 
yeutter said an allinclusive disaster relief program very 
well might not be necessary for springplanted crops because their 
prospects have been improved by recent rains 
the house legislation is also not restricted to drought problems 
and would make farmers eligible for aid if they have losses this 
year for hundreds of other crops because of severe weather 
no crop is covered unless it suffered a natural disaster if 
there is no disaster there is no coverage at all said rep dan 
glickman dkan chairman of a house agriculture subcommittee on 
wheat sybeans and feed grains so for all of those farmers who 
are suffering an extraordinary loss let us do the same thing we did 
last year let us show compassion let us show mercy for those 
people 
portions of the great plains and western corn belt have not 
recovered from the drought of 1988 despite recent rains in some 
areas lingering dry conditions early this year particularly hurt 
producers in winter wheatgrowing states which range from 
washington to ohio and texas to montana 
nationwide the winter wheat crop is projected to be the smallest 
since 1978 in kansas traditionally the nations leading wheat 
producer forecasters say this years harvest will be more than a 
third smaller than last year 
key provisions of the house relief package would 
make farmers eligible for assistance if they suffer losses of 
more than 35 percent from a weatherrelated disaster 
cap benefits at 100000 for each producer and prohibit 
payments to those with 2 million or more in gross farm revenues 
establish a new 75 million grant program for water assistance 
to rural communities in drought areas money to pay for the program 
would have to be provided in separate legislation

routine use of mammography and breast 
examinations can reduce deaths from breast cancer in women over age 
40 a coalition of medical and research groups says 
the groups including the american cancer society the american 
medical association and the national cancer institute on tuesday 
issued recommendations for screening women with no signs or symptoms 
of breast cancer 
beginning at age 40 annual clinical breast exams and mammograms 
every one or two years 
age 50 and older breast exams and mammograms every year 
breast cancer is the leading type of cancer in us women and 
second only to lung cancer in cancer deaths among women about 
142000 women are expected to be diagnosed with the disease and some 
43000 will die from it this year 
we would like to recommend these guidelines to all women and 
all doctors in the country as a way of decreasing this great 
mortality rate from breast cancer in the united states said 
charles r smart chief of the early detection branch at the 
national cancer institute 
the major groups in the coalition had already recommended this 
mammography schedule but some of the other groups had called for 
regular mammograms beginning as late as age 50 
the american cancer society and the ama said they will continue 
to recommend that women between 35 and 40 have a baseline mammogram 
for doctors to use as a comparison during later regular screening 
the groups said they agreed on the recommendations to end 
confusion caused by differing guidelines which they said has 
resulted in only about a quarter of physicians routinely 
recommending mammograms 
they cited mounting evidence that early detection of breast 
cancer prolongs survival and said mammography has improved greatly 
as a diagnostic tool since the 1960s 
about half of all breast cancers currently are found in the early 
stages of the disease but that could increase to 70 to 75 percent 
if the recommendations are followed by all women smart said 
the guidelines do not address selfexamination but the groups 
said this remains an important tool in the detection of breast 
cancer they noted however that cancer detected in this way often 
has grown beyond the early stage 
endorsing the guidelines were the american cancer society the 
american medical association the national cancer institute the 
national medical association the american academy of family 
physicians the american association of women radiologists the 
american college of radiology the american society for therapeutic 
radiology and oncology the american osteopathic college of 
radiology the american society of internal medicine and the college 
of american pathologists

socalled hate crimes involving the race 
religion ethnic group or sexual preference of victims would come in 
for a yearly inventory under a measure approved by the house and 
headed for the senate 
it creates an inventory to quantify the amount of criminal 
bigotry in this country rep dan glickman dkan said tuesday 
as the house approved the measure 36847 
the bill would have the justice department count the crimes of 
homicide assault robbery burglary theft arson vandalism 
trespassing threats and others the department deems appropriate if 
they have an element of bigotry against the victims 
the house has approved similar bills three times before but the 
senate has not followed suit hatecrime legislation cleared the 
senate judiciary committee on march 9 however and supporters are 
hoping for a floor vote 
annual nationwide crime statistics already are published by the 
fbi but the data is not broken down to reflect crimes involving 
bigotry 
supporters of the bill say it could help combat a growing wave of 
hate crimes across the nation this legislation is an opportunity 
to begin the counterattack against crimes based on hate said rep 
charles e schumer dny 
the more we know about crimes of hate the more chance we have 
of preventing them said rep barbara b kennelly dconn 
rep bill green rny said 1281 antisemitic acts were 
reported by the antidefamation league of the bnai brith in 1988 
he said the national gay and lesbian task force reported 7008 acts 
of antihomosexual violence in 1987 there is also evidence of 
growing ku klux klan neonazi skinhead and other hategroup 
activity green said 
the congressional budget office estimated that gathering such 
data could cost from 1 million to 10 million a year depending on 
the methods used 
supporters said the measure was important for its symbolism as 
well as for the actual collection of data 
congress should send a clear signal to all people that crimes 
based on race religion or sexuality will not be tolerated said 
rep benjamin gilman rny

even a roman catholic cardinal has those moments 
when hed trade the management of a 15millionmember archdiocese 
for the tranquility of ministering to a small congregation 
but cardinal edmund casimir szoka who has waded into several 
church disputes since becoming head of the detroit archdiocese in 
1981 banishes such thoughts quickly 
i am where i am he said 
szoka became a priest 35 years ago and started in a small parish 
but began climbing the church hierarchy quickly 
this month marks the first anniversary of his installation as a 
cardinal by pope john paul ii it was a year that placed him 
squarely at odds with some detroit catholics for ordering the 
closure or consolidation of 30 innercity churches 
some of those parishes were to go to court today seeking an 
injunction to halt the closings 
the brouhaha over church closings wasnt szokas first challenge 
early in his tenure in detroit where he was named archbishop in 
1981 szoka set out to make the annulment process in michigan more 
efficient he increased staff and introduced computers shortening 
the waiting period for an annulment from six years to about nine 
months 
he faced another challenge in his first year when a roman 
catholic nun sister mary agnes mansour took over as head of the 
state department of social services at the time the agency 
administered abortions for the poor szoka wanted her to resign or 
publicly oppose abortion she quit 
sitting in his modestly decorated downtown office szoka quietly 
justified his decisions and church doctrine 
he expressed dismay over accounts that money alone forced the 
church closings money was a factor szoka said but more important 
was the dwindling number of parishioners and the inadequate supply 
of priests 
its not enough just to maintain a church building and slowly 
watch it die as the people die he said 
he admires the opponents of the closings as deeply dedicated to 
parish and faith but sees his task as providing for the whole 
church 
its always the problem of trying to find the balance of what 
is for the common good and what is for special interests 
i cant work miracles he said the churchclosing dispute 
has made me accept more clearly that all i can do is the best i 
can accepting that brings a great deal of peace a great deal of 
comfort and tranquility to my life 
szoka was born sept 14 1927 in grand rapids to casimir szoka 
a polish immigrant and mary wolgat szoka his parents divorced 
early in his childhood and he was raised in nearby muskegon 
in the eighth grade he visited st josephs seminary in grand 
rapids expecting to find young men locked in unending study and 
prayer 
they were normal boys just like us he said i came home 
that night and i remember saying i was going to go to the seminary 
and that never changed 
william kienzle a seminary classmate and now a mystery writer in 
detroit said szoka lived in the library though szoka insists he 
played handball baseball and track 
even in seminary it was clear szoka would be more than a 
simple parish priest classmate bill zuidema recalled 
out of the seminary szoka was appointed associate pastor of st 
francis parish in the tiny upper peninsula town of manistique he 
was secretary to the bishop in marquette and later chancellor there 
and in 1971 started a parish in gaylord 
after becoming detroit archbishop he started an annual 
multimilliondollar fundraising drive catholic services appeal 
szoka has undergone angioplasty for a narrowed artery and he 
conceded that the duties of running a large diverse diocese are 
taxing 
occasionally he wishes for quieter days 
but only for a moment he said i have never refused an 
assignment because i still am of the conviction that if an 
assignment comes from your superiors in the church its coming from 
god

the air line pilots association wants the 
federal government to intervene in contract talks with eastern 
airlines a request likely to further complicate the strikebound 
carriers plans to emerge from bankruptcy proceedings 
meanwhile separate courtordered talks which union officials 
say have brought no progress were continuing for a third day today 
also today alpa leaders from nine other airlines were meeting in 
washington to discuss ways to support the eastern strikers 
the pilots union tuesday asked the national mediation board to 
referee its dispute with eastern accusing the airline of refusing 
to schedule further negotiations as required by the federal railway 
labor act 
despite our repeated efforts all of the major issues are still 
unresolved alpa president henry a duffy said in a letter 
requesting the appointment of a mediator 
but eastern said it has balked at further negotiations under the 
labor law because the other talks have been ordered by a us 
bankruptcy court judge who is overseeing easterns affairs while it 
is under chapter 11 protection from creditors 
we dont know what they are trying to accomplish with the 
mediation eastern spokesman robin matell said we believe that 
the bankruptcy court and the examiner are better able to handle 
bankruptcyrelated labor agreements 
granting of requests for mediation is routine and in this case 
could trigger an unprecedented situation mediation of a dispute 
involving a bankrupt airline already being struck by another one of 
its unions 
federal mediation also could result in a direct strike by alpa 
pilots most of whom have honored machinists union pickets at 
eastern and are considered legal sympathy strikers in the nearly 
fourmonthold machinists strike 
nearly 300 pilots have crossed machinists picket lines but alpa 
officials contend most of them would refuse to work if their union 
struck eastern however eastern predicts most of the pilots will 
continue to work if a pilot strike materializes 
airline disputes are regulated by the railway labor act which 
gives the mediation board broad power to try to resolve contract 
disputes unions cannot strike airlines or railways unless released 
from mediation a situation which occurred prior to the machinists 
strike 
eastern last week sought bankruptcy court permission to cancel 
its contract with the pilots and impose changes in wages and work 
rules it said it needs to reorganize as a smaller carrier 
but parties involved in federal mediation are prohibited from 
altering terms of their contracts 
mediation board spokesman david bushnell said he did not know 
what impact federal mediation would have on easterns attempt in 
bankruptcy court to abrogate the pilots contract 
matell said eastern officials believe the bankruptcy court 
proceedings would supersede the authority of the mediation board 
cole said alpa attorneys are reviewing the issue 
if a mediator declared an impasse a 30day cooling off period 
would begin and after that the union would be free to strike and 
the airline would be free to change provisions of existing contracts

handgun manufacturers and distributors would be 
financially liable for injuries or deaths caused in shootings under 
a measure awaiting final action by the district of columbia council 
on an 8 to 4 vote tuesday the council voted to allow shooting 
victims and the families of homicide victims to recover monetary 
damages from the manufacturer of a gun used in a shooting 
regardless of who was at fault 
if given final approval the measure would be the first such law 
in the united states 
council members said they hope the measure will reduce the 
availability of firearms in the district as well as around the 
country 
this is not pr said william p lightfoot an atlarge 
council member who backs the legislation if you make a dangerous 
weapon were going to hold you responsible any time it is used 
richard r atkinson jr a member of the board of directors of 
the national rifle association and president of the district of 
columbia firearms association warned the council that its action 
could harm home rule for the district such a law could give federal 
opponents new ammunition to attack the districts local government 
he said 
i think if the city council continues with this kind of 
meddling in other states affairs it will go down in history as the 
city council that lost home rule atkinson said 
council member betty ann kane who voted against the bill called 
it a kneejerk response to street violence she said she does 
not understand why we are taking away individual responsibility 
for gunrelated crimes

two brothers are being sued for 75 million by 
hud for allegedly failing to turn over 16 million from 
agencyacquired singlefamily homes to the government 
the lawsuit alleges that david and robert martin of atlanta 
escrow agents for the sales failed to turn over the money between 
october 1984 and may 1987 
us attorney robert barr said an audit leading to the lawsuit 
was begun in may 1987 and revealed that government losses reached 
25 million 
barr and raymond buday jr the us department of housing and 
urban developments regional counsel said the investigation 
revealed that false documents were filed to mask the nonpayment 
the martins lawyers contend the money was paid but cannot be 
traced in washington because of sloppy government bookkeeping 
the martins are not charged with a crime 
the nature of the case lent itself to a civil suit barr said 
tuesday 
he said there are related criminal investigations pending but 
declined to say if they involved the martins 
the homes in question were repossessed by hud after owners 
defaulted on federal housing administration loans 
there are several investigations into missing funds including 
major ones in indianapolis denver philadelphia and the washington 
dc area investigators say the cases appear unrelated 
critics contend the problems stem from incompetence and 
influencepeddling at high levels of hud during the reagan 
administration

house democrats concur with a senatepassed 
plan to authorize 175 billion for childcare programs next year 
but are considering a different approach to spending the money 
the first part of the house plan won approval tuesday in the 
education and labor committee passing on a 2311 vote after 
democrats defeated dozens of republican attempts to significantly 
change the measure 
in addition to its differences with the senate spending plan the 
house package also lacks the taxcredit provisions adopted by the 
senate last week the final house measure will likely have a 
taxrelief package too but chamber rules require it to originate 
in the ways and means committee 
that panel is expected to act on child care next month the house 
leadership then plans to bring the direct spending and tax credits 
up for floor debate together aides said that might not occur until 
late august or september 
among the amendments that passed the labor committee was one 
trimming the fiscal 1990 spending authorization from 25 billion to 
175 billion matching the senate level the panel again following 
the senates lead also deleted proposed federal child care 
standards from the measure in favor of leaving regulation to the 
states 
at the white house president bush reiterated his support for a 
childcare measure dependent almost exclusively on tax credits and 
said his position has not changed on the senate measure which the 
administration last week labeled a candidate for a veto bush 
however left the door open for compromise 
i would like to see what comes down here before i make further 
statements about what action i will take or wont take he said 
speaking several hours before the house committee acted 
tuesdays committees action indicated that significant 
differences are likely to exist between the senate bill and the 
final house measure 
the plan endorsed tuesday would divide the federal spending into 
four areas with 25 percent going to increase funding for head start 
programs 25 percent for childcare programs before and after school 
in public schools 35 percent for programs providing services to 
children less than 3 years old and the remaining 15 percent for 
state programs designed to increase the availability affordabilty 
and quality of child care 
working families whose incomes are at or below the poverty line 
would be eligible for the programs with some services also 
available on a sliding fee scale for families with annual incomes 
within 150 percent of the poverty level 
the committees plan would also spend 25 million to create a 
fund to give businesses 1 in federal grant money for each 3 spent 
on eligible childcare services 
by contrast the senate package calls for 70 percent of the 
spending to go directly to lowincome parents to help them pay for 
child care including the use of vouchers or other certificates 
created by state governments twentytwo percent of the money in the 
senate plan would be for loans grants and training programs 
designed to expand childcare opportunity and quality with the 
remaining 8 percent used for state administrative costs

the federal communications commission has 
turned down a request to delay a new pricing scheme scheduled to go 
into effect july 1 for the nations largest longdistance company 
atampt 
the requests for a stay had been filed in june by the puerto rico 
telephone co and la telefonica larga distancia which had said the 
new plan to limit the prices american telephone amp telegraph co can 
charge would put the two companies at a competitive disadvantage 
but the fcc in a decision made public tuesday concluded that 
the companies failed to provide adequate reasons for a stay and the 
public would benefit from the new pricing 
atampt last month told the commission it would lower its prices by 
140 million on july 1 the price cap lets atampt which in 1988 
controlled 68 percent of the us longdistance market raise rates 
3 percent less than the rate of inflation in three categories of

a case in which the supreme court is being 
asked to overturn its landmark legalization of abortion is one of 
five anticipated rulings separating the supreme court from its 
threemonth summer recess 
among the five is an important case over governmentsponsored 
religious displays that could move the barriers on the separation of 
church and state 
the possibility remains that one or more of the five cases in 
which rulings are pending will not be decided thursday expected to 
be the last day of the 198889 term 
the justices could order that one or more of the cases be held 
over and reargued in the courts next term which begins in october 
if that occurs a decision likely would not be announced until 
sometime in 1990 
in every supreme court term since 1977 at least one case has 
been held over for reargument the following term 
there is also the chance the court could take the highly unusual 
step of leaving the announcement of a decision on any of the five 
cases until friday or an even later date 
the last day of the term is also traditionally the day justices 
have chosen to announce retirement three justices who have passed 
their 80th birthdays william j brennan who is 83 and harry 
blackmun and thurgood marshall both 80 are considered the most 
likely candidates for retirement 
the religion case like all others this year has been 
overshadowed by a missouri dispute in which the justices are being 
asked to reverse the courts 1973 decision legalizing abortion 
but a controversy over displaying a christmas nativity scene and 
a hanukkah menorah at government buildings in pittsburgh provides 
justice anthony m kennedy his first opportunity to rule on a topic 
that has so closely divided the court in recent years 
and the courts ruling could affect more than religious displays 
offering new guidelines about how high a wall the constitution 
erects between church and state 
at issue are displays of a christmas nativity scene inside the 
allegheny county courthouse and a hanukkah menorah on the front 
steps of the citycounty building a few blocks away 
the supreme court by a 54 vote in a 1984 decision allowed 
communities to include religious symbols in officially sponsored 
holiday displays 
the 1984 ruling in a pawtucket ri case involved a nativity 
scene surrounded by secular symbols such as santa claus reindeer 
and snowmen the pittsburgh creche had been displayed by itself 
lower courts across the nation have been confused about just 
where the 1984 ruling drew the line between permissible governmental 
acknowledgment of religious heritages and the unconstitutional 
promotion or advancement of religion 
most lower courts have treated the 1984 decision as a narrow one 
and have disallowed various religious displays deemed too religious 
the other three cases in which decisions are pending include 
a freespeech dispute over a new york state university ban on 
some commercial activities in dormitory rooms a federal appeals 
court ruled that students rights were violated when college 
officials barred a cookware company from conducting its sales 
pitches in dorm rooms 
a significant controversy to any state in which an indian 
reservation is located at issue in a case from washington state is 
whether indian tribes may control through tribal zoning laws the 
use of land owned by nonindians within a reservations boundaries 
a pair of cases from arkansas and florida in which the justices 
must decide whether businesses that successfully challenge state 
taxes are entitled to collect refunds on taxes paid before they were 
invalidated

president bushs call for a proposed 
constitutional amendment to forbid flag desecration would be the 
first new amendment before states since 1985 if it passes congress 
a 1789 proposal to bar sitting members of congress from raising 
their pay is the only constitutional amendment pending before the 
states 
six other proposed amendments have passed congress by the 
necessary twothirds vote but failed to win ratification in the 
required threefourths of the states currently 38 of the 50 states 
bush called tuesday for a constitutional amendment that would set 
aside last weeks supreme court decision and forbid desecration of 
the american flag 
most proposed amendments expire if not ratified after seven 
years in the case of the one pending amendment no expiration date 
was set by congress 
the pay amendment authored by james madison states no law 
varying the compensation for the services of the senators and 
representatives shall take effect until an election of 
representatives shall have intervened 
twentythree states have approved the amendment which consumer 
advocate ralph nader and some state lawmakers have attempted to 
revive in recent years during controversies over congressional pay 
the last proposal to expire without enough states was a plan to 
give the district of columbia full voting rights in congress it 
fell short by 22 states in 1985 the capital currently has a 
nonvoting delegate in the house 
before that the equal rights amendment fell three states short 
in 1982 
four other amendments which were sent to the states but failed to 
be ratified included a formula proposed in 1789 for determining the 
number of house members a ban suggested by the 11th congress on 
citizenship for anyone receiving a title of nobility or honor from 
any emperor king prince or foreign power a bar proposed in 
1861 on congress interfering with the domestic institutions of any 
state including slavery but slavery was abolished in 1865 by the 
13th amendment and a 1924 proposal involving child labor 
regulations 
there also is a move afoot for a constitutional convention which 
must be called after a petition from twothirds of the states 
thirtytwo of the required 34 states have applied to congress this 
method has not yet been used to amend the constitution 
the congressional research service said there were at least 9994 
proposed constitutional amendments introduced in congress from 1789 
through 1984 but the number is considered low because of poor 
recordkeeping in the early years 
the library of congress says 155 such proposals have been 
introduced since the 101st congress began in january

hours after a 7yearold girl was swept into a 
storm sewer rescuers gave up plans to search for her in the 
fastflowing water and her mother abandoned hope 
but latricia reese managed to cling to cracks in the lining of 
the sewer for 12 hours while the flood waters from tropical storm 
allison swirled around her 
it was a horrible night and a terrible storm but we found a 
rainbow at the end said karen resse after two construction 
workers found her daughter 
i gave up most hope and everybody kept telling me not to give 
it up but i did mrs reese said tuesday while latricia rested 
in a hospital bed and watched cartoons 
i just held on to the crack in the cement latricia said 
complaining that mosquitos and ants bothered her throughout her 
ordeal 
latricia her hands white and wrinkled and her body covered with 
scrapes and bruises was suffering mild shock tuesday but was 
reported in good condition at humana hospitalsouthmore said 
spokeswoman ramona branch 
the 4foottall latricia was playing in a flooded ditch near her 
home around 730 pm monday when her cousin saw her lose her 
footing and vanish into an 18inch concrete culvert 
she spent the entire night in the citys major sewer system 
with all that flood water coming in on her and hardly had a 
scratch said fire department spokesman mike warnke its just a 
miracle that she could still be alive 
when the police diving team was called out the water was still 
flowing at a rate they believed too hazardous to risk entering the 
unfamiliar storm sewage system police thought the girl would have 
been swept to where the sewer system empties into a bayou warnke 
said 
the diving team told me they cant do any more its too 
dangerous for them they told my friend they thought they should get 
me a pastor because i would need it and it didnt look too good

girl at daylight tuesday other relatives enlisted the help of two 
construction workers checking sewer lines who removed manhole covers 
near the spot where the girl disappeared and found her in the sewer

mexico citys intelligence police had 
weathered accusations from ordinary citizens of extortion 
kidnapping torture even murder surviving repeated calls for its 
dismantling 
but the unit could not overcome the ugly politically charged 
scandal of the 1984 murder of manuel buendia a frontpage columnist 
and author who specialized in exposing wrongdoing in high places 
mayor manuel camacho solis ordered the intelligence police 
disbanded tuesday after three commanders were charged in the tangled 
assassination plot 
he called their involvement intolerable 
the three commanders served under the alleged mastermind of the 
buendia killing jose antonio zorrilla perez former director of the 
nowdefunct federal security administration 
zorrilla whose fbilike agency was disbanded for corruption in 
1985 is accused of ordering buendia killed to stop the columnist 
from exposing his links to drug lords 
the commanders juventino prado hurtado sofia naya suarez and 
raul perez carmona have all said they were tortured into 
confessing their participation in what was codenamed operation 
news 
corruption and brutality are old agonizing and acknowledged 
problems among the lowpaid poorly trained mexican police when 
reputed drug kingpin miguel angel felix gallardo was arrested 
earlier this year the entire local police force in his hometown of 
culiacan was rounded up along with him 
but even in a country where some fear cops as much as criminals 
mexico citys intelligence police were regarded as particularly 
dangerous 
critics said their main business was extortion 
this is the fundamental reason they detain people rep 
victor orduna chairman of the justice administration committee of 
the capitals city council said in a recent interview 
orduna and rep ramon sosamontes chairman of the councils 
public safety committee say scores of citizens complained of 
detention in clandestine jails torture and extortion 
human rights organizations and lawyers reported similar 
complaints 
some were verbal others were filed with the city or the courts 
all were still pending when camacho solis finally ordered the unit 
dismantled 
critics of the intelligence police had been hoping the taint of 
the buendia murder a crime that shocked the nation and galvanized a 
timid press into prodding two successive administrations for 
justice would accomplish what the complaints of ordinary people 
failed to do 
they are virtually gone human rights lawyer maria teresa 
jardi told the ap after zorrilla was indicted 
by most accounts the intelligence division was a crimefighting 
idea that went badly awry 
highranking police sources who insisted on anonymity said some 
of the roughest agents and officers in zorrillas disbanded security 
administration were chosen for the intelligence police 
the sources admitted privately that the attempt to harness those 
elements had created a monster 
in mexican police circles there is this idea to control 
delinquents you need a worse delinquent orduna said but this 
division became a social problem for the city 
the intelligence police had image problems from it outset late 
last year its original director was miguel nazar haro zorrillas 
predecessor at the security administration and a veteran of the 
harsh political repression of the 1970s 
the appointment created an uproar 
the mexican academy of human rights produced several people who 
testified that nazar haro had personally tortured them the press 
pointed out that he was still wanted by authorities in calfornia on 
a federal indictment alleging he was in a ring that stole hundreds 
of autos and smuggled them across the border 
officials of president carlos salinas de gortaris new 
administration staunchly defended nazar haro as a smart veteran cop 
and tough crimefighter 
were simply trying to fight crime police chief javier 
garcia paniagua said at the time and we will be forceful 
the divisions image took another sharp blow when its agents 
helped quell a december prison riot 500 miles from mexico city in 
tepic a videotape viewed by the associated press revealed that six 
inmates died after surrendering 
nazar haro resigned in late february but the intelligence police 
were back in the headlines within weeks after agents detained nine 
women on the way home from an illegal abortion clinic 
several of the women say they were beaten and their doctor was 
tortured before their release without charges 14 hours later 
sosamontes and orduna said the incident which the police refused 
to discuss was designed to extort protection money from the 
elderly doctor they say he paid a substantial sum 
the march abortion clinic incident prompted more demands for the 
divisions disbanding city officials agreed instead to close its 
infamous jail tlaxcoaque 
orduna said the closure created even more problems 
before i knew where to look for people he said recently 
now i dont know where to go they say there are four new 
clandestine jails but we dont know precisely where they are

a crucial scene from the oscarwinning rain 
man has been excised from the version shown by at least 15 major 
airlines because the scene about aviation safety was considered 
unfit for passengers 
in the fourminute rain man sequence dustin hoffmans 
autistic savant character refuses to board a plane because he has 
memorized airplane crash statistics 
pressured by his brother charlie babbitt played by tom cruise 
hoffmans raymond babbitt panics and starts screaming and thrashing 
about 
i think its a key scene to the entire movie thats why its 
in there barry levinson the films academy awardwinning 
director said in a telephone interview tuesday it launches their 
entire odyssey across country because they couldnt fly 
without that scene it comes down to this you basically lose 
an enormous impact of the film that scene tells you that they 
mechanically are forced to drive across country and secondly that 
charlie can only push raymond so far because he knows what will 
happen 
furthermore the deletion of the scene makes later references to 
it nonsensical 
rain man started showing on airplanes in june and is now 
being screened regularly on 15 carriers said don sathern 
supervisor of visual programming for sonytrans com inc the 
nations largest inflight movie service 
everybody wanted the scene out he said usually 
planecrash sequences are automatically out 
one airline spokeswoman said it was the sort of scene that 
typically could make passengers uneasy 
its our policy to remove portions of feature films as they 
relate to violence nudity obscenities or anything that could 
create discomfort for passengers about being on airplanes 
patricia graham manager of inflight programming for united 
airlines said in this weeks people magazine 
levinson said he didnt have the authority to insist that the 
scene be restored we cant do anything about it he said 
still he found the editing ridiculous 
these airlines dont know that supposedly there is a degree of 
risk levinson asked theyve never heard of such a thing were 
saying that over the years planes have crashed that is a reality 
of life 
in the airport scene charlie the hustler brother tries to 
prevail on his autistic sibling to board an airliner raymond was 
adamant 
airline travel is very dangerous 
dont be silly charlie snaps its the safest in the 
world youre going to love this trust me 
raymond remains steadfast in his travel phobia citing 30 air 
crashes in 1987 and 211 fatalities 
one airline is showing rain man with the scene intact 
qantas which raymond singles out for the best safety record 
qantas charlie demanded in exasperation 
never crashed raymond muttered

carrie bray was looking for reallife 
cowboys when she came to cheyenne but the closest the 14yearold 
texan got was a peek inside the howdy wagon parked in front of 
the chamber of commerce 
theres got to be some cowboys around here somewhere the 
dallas teenager said during a recent visit with her mother 
sorry tourists lured to cheyenne to live the legend are 
finding theres little legend to live in the southeastern wyoming 
city of 47000 residents 
city officials know theyre letting tourists down and admit they 
might be deceiving them with the advertising slogan 
can they live the legend no said mayor gary schaeffer 
as soon as people start making up slogans theres a perception of 
problems or they wouldnt need a slogan we have to give them what 
they need to live it 
realizing the western deficiency of the cowboy states capital 
civic leaders are beefing up frontier activities and sinking 
thousands of dollars into marketing surveys and tourist promotions 
people who come here from the east expect to see the old west 
like they see it on television dirt streets swinging saloon 
doors said scott binning director of the cheyenne visitors 
council some are totally disappointed because we have paved 
streets electric lights and running water 
so cheyenne this summer will have mounted police riding the 
streets mock gunslingers many of them real estate agents and 
carpenters shooting it out at high noon in the town square and 
for the first time in years horses to rent 
ive talked to tourists and most of em didnt believe there 
wasnt a place they could ride said wranglerclad jim talkington 
who opened his blue ribbon horse farm 10 miles west of cheyenne to 
trail rides a few weeks ago they were aghast they couldnt ride a 
horse in cheyenne 
minta garner a teacher from memphis tenn said she was 
expecting to see sagebrush plains horses and cattle 
i felt more like the old west out on the open range than i do 
here in town she said 
the mayor a pennsylvania native has issued a proclamation 
encouraging residents to say howdy instead of hello and to 
dress western throughout july which climaxes with the daddy of 
em all the cheyenne frontier days rodeo 
but not all residents are receptive schaeffer said adding he 
was almost strung up when he suggested building wooden sidewalks 
downtown 
some members of the business community would rather be viewed as 
a burgeoning city on the verge of economic greatness and cultural 
sophistication he said 
state sen win hickey a member of the cheyenne downtown 
development association said a little western flare is fine but 
by no means should we lose sight that were living in the 21st 
century 
if everyone wore western clothes and horses and carriages rode 
downtown it might be fun to come and look at but i cant believe 
they would say this is a progressive city and i would like to invest 
in it she said there needs to be a melding of what would 
attract the tourists but not detract the business person 
others say cheyenne already provides a glimpse into the old west 
state rep don sullivan of cheyenne the chairman of the local 
historical society said the citys mansions museums and railroads 
are rich in the lore of cattle barons rustlers and hangmen 
can you come and play cowboys the answer is no we dont have 
guys in black hats killing each other on 16th street he said 
but there is an aura an impression that people have of a true 
old western community and in all the best senses that is very much 
deserved its clean living clean life healthy people 
ed johnson 28 from port washington wis got a taste of that 
i hear that the people out west are friendlier and everyone i 
passed on the street said hello 
but not howdy

a strike immobilized all of britains railroads 
today and virtually all of londons subway network forcing millions 
of commuters to drive cycle walk or ride buses to work 
it was the second 24hour strike in eight days by 75000 national 
railroad workers and the eighth unofficial walkout in 12 weeks by 
the capitals 10500 subway workers 
traffic jams in london started two hours early and traffic is 
definitely heavier than usual said scotland yard spokeswoman 
alison bland 
birmingham liverpool manchester edinburgh and glasgow also 
reported earlier rush hours with more traffic congestion than 
normal the automobile association said 
last wednesday there was little of the traffic chaos that might 
have been expected from a triplebarreled strike that hit the 
national railroad and londons buses and subways many commuters 
carefully planned their journeys and others simply stayed at home 
this week major companies again hired fleets of coaches to bring 
in staff and london hotels were full of employees spending the 
night in the city to beat the strike 
the 248station subway system carries 27 million passengers a 
day while rail services are used by some 2 million people 
a sharply reduced subway service was operating on two of londons 
10 subway lines said london underground spokesman david morris 
londons buses which carry 32 million people daily appeared to 
be working normally today and special shuttle services were added 
between victoria station in central london and the southern suburb 
of wimbledon where the twoweek lawn tennis championships opened 
monday 
i think its absolutely disgraceful that people in the 
transport unions dont think about their fellow citizens prime 
minister margaret thatcher told sky news the cable television 
network 
its the public sector unions that are the problem those 
people are there to serve the public but they dont she said 
the national union of railwaymen is striking against stateowned 
british rails offer of a 7 percent wage hike and union leader 
jimmy knapp is demanding a pay rise of at least 10 percent 
the subway workers want a 99 weekly increase to operate without

president bush seems more interested in defending 
the flag than defending the ideas the flag represents say civil 
rights leaders who heard a speech by attorney general dick 
thornburgh 
in his address tuesday to operation push thornburgh said the 
bush administration wouldnt immediately pursue legislation to 
overturn controversial us supreme court rulings on job 
discrimination 
thornburgh said the administration wanted to first assess the 
impact of the high court rulings on antidiscrimination laws 
jesse jackson founder of the chicagobased operation push 
expressed disappointment with thornburghs waitandsee message 
he and others contrasted it with bushs immediate call for a 
constitutional amendment to set aside last weeks supreme court 
ruling nullifying flag desecration laws in 48 states 
we cannot help but notice the haste with which bush has rushed 
to defend the flag and his lack of haste in defending the substance 
that flag stands for which is equality under the law and 
fairness jackson said after thornburghs speech 
in his speech thornburgh said the administration is fully 
committed to eliminating every form of discrimination in our 
society 
but while acknowledging that some people view the recent high 
court decisions as a retreat in the battle for civil rights he 
urged caution 
i recognize as does the president that the full effect of 
these rulings will not be felt until they are applied in new 
cases the attorney general said 
in fact the president has asked that i monitor the 
implementation of these opinions in the lower courts to assess their 
impact on equal employment opportunities and if needed to suggest 
any legislative or executive action that might be required to 
resolve inequities he said 
bush made similar comments in washington earlier in the day 
i am strongly committed to equal opportunity for all 
americans bush said adding that he had been advised in a justice 
department report that the supreme court decisions didnt undermine 
those principles 
thornburgh received a generally polite but cool reception from 
the audience of about 200 
several delegates to the convention said they believed thornburgh 
was speaking for bush and not for himself 
clearly the dick thornburgh that i heard this morning was not 
the dick thornburgh i have known in the past said richard 
hatcher former mayor of gary ind the only conclusion i can 
reach is that it was a speech that was crafted at the white house 
i personally felt he was a little uncomfortable with it 
hatcher added for the president to call for a constitutional 
amendment thats a pretty serious step i cant help but feel that 
he is showing greater compassion regarding an inanimate object 
precious though the flag is to all of us than he is to some 22 
million citizens of this country 
jackson who declined to criticize thornburgh called for an 
effort to persuade congress to enact legislation that would set 
aside the recent high court decisions 
the supreme court has invalidated minority setaside quotas for 
local public works contracts made it harder for plaintiffs to prove 
employment discrimination and given white males the right to 
challenge affirmative action plans previously approved by courts 
during a discussion after thornburghs speech rutgers university 
law professor arthur kinoy loudly compared the administrations 
waitandsee response to the reaction after 19th century supreme 
court decisions that dismantled reconstruction legislation 
the high court decisions included the 1896 ruling that upheld 
separate but equal facilities for blacks and whites 
thornburgh responded angrily 
you are free to question the integrity and commitment of the 
president and the attorney general thornburgh said but i dont 
think it adds to the kind of dialogue that we are seeking to engage 
in to reduce this to the level of shouting matches

air force officials blame a bomb rack that 
was out of adjustment and contained a wornout part for an accident 
last month in which a jet fighter dropped a live 500pound bomb 
accidentally 
the bomb exploded may 4 near the small west georgia town of 
brantley and flattened some trees but caused no injuries or major 
damage 
the air force subsequently has tested the bomb rack on the f16 
jet and regularly replaced the suspect part but the planes will 
continue to fly practice bombing runs into fort benning passing 
over the marion county area east of the post 
were looking at alternate ways of getting there weve 
discussed that but no decision has been made col joe prater 
commander of the 347th tactical fighter wing based at moody air 
force base near valdosta said tuesday 
the bomb exploded 40 feet above the ground when it hit a tree 
scarring and knocking down trees for 100 yards in every direction 
a summary of the findings of an investigation of the accident 
undertaken by moody air force base officials was released tuesday in 
washington dc 
prater who oversaw the probe said the cause likely was the 
alignment of the bomb rack and the likely deterioration of a 
rubberized oring that may have caused the bomb to get hung up 
and then fall unexpectedly

a new state law that allows police to 
withhold the names of crime victims went into effect quietly earlier 
this month but is creating an uproar 
the law which amends the texas open records act allows 
government agencies to keep confidential the identities of victims 
of felonies including homicide 
police also can withhold information that could lead to victims 
identification such as addresses the bill went into effect june 14 
generally the news media voluntarily withholds the names only of 
victims of sex crimes 
one of the sponsors rep fred blair said the bill was aimed at 
protecting crime victims from harassment whether by reporters 
questions or from other sources such as security companies he said 
victims or their families could release the information but it 
otherwise would not be public unless it reached the courts 
a lot of crimes go unreported because the victims just dont 
want to go through it blair said i was thinking about the 
victims i wasnt thinking about anybody else 
i think the law is outrageous and i hope law enforcement 
agencies will choose to ignore it until this serious challenge to 
freedom of information can be corrected jack loftis editor and 
vice president of the houston chronicle said in a telephone 
interview tuesday 
the chronicle waged a lengthy court battle in recent years to 
obtain records from the houston police department 
in amarillo reporters and editors said that authorities would 
not release the names of people involved in a fatal car accident 
last weekend because of the law 
if i hadnt been familiar with the case already i would have 
been out of luck said john hagerty of kfdatv it really ties 
our hands 
dennis spies managing editor of the amarillo daily news said 
his reporters encountered similar problems with police who refused 
to give the name of the woman killed in the accident because a 
suspected drunken driver was charged with involuntary manslaughter 
a felony 
the paper finally got the names of the woman and her critically 
injured husband from a funeral home spies said 
spies also said police refused to disclose the names of five 
people injured in a knife fight at an amarillo nightclub monday 
im sure lawmakers had good intentions spies said but 
its not helping our readers any it affects everybody 
blair said he believes some law enforcement agencies are 
misinterpreting the laws intent and that authorities should be more 
liberal in releasing such information 
there is so much misinformation on the bill various 
departments are still studying it blair said departments that 
are withholding information have already just acrosstheboard 
broadly interpreted using the bill that way 
blair said that under the house counsels interpretation the 
names of the crash victims should have been released by authorities 
police spokesmen in austin and san antonio have said they are 
studying the law before changing any policies in midland deputy 
chief john smith said police were not aware of it 
the texas department of public safety which asked for a state 
attorney generals interpretation of the law told troopers to 
withhold the names of people killed or injured in drunkendriving 
accidents said spokesman mike cox 
ira perry regional director of the society of professional 
journalists said he expected several media groups to fight the 
measure 
were getting calls from everywhere either about problems or 
from news media saying what is going on here said sharon 
jayson chairwoman of texas media a freedomofinformation lobby 
for several statewide news associations she said the group tuesday 
was discussing how to respond to the law 
gov bill clements said tuesday that if asked hell consider 
putting the issue on the agenda of the special legislative session 
that began last week 
certainly clements realized what he was signing but 
there was no opposition voiced during the bills journey through 
the house and senate said rossanna salazar the governors deputy

a wayward bottlenosed dolphin that has made the 
east river home for the last week has attracted a steady stream of 
admirers and curious onlookers who ooh and aah as it leaps from the 
water 
when it jumps in a graceful arc there are excited shouts of 
there he is and hey flipper 
john soto a security guard is one of the dolphins most devoted 
admirers 
ever since it was spotted in the east river june 20 he has been 
on the esplanade from sunrise to sunset in the vicinity of 96th 
street to watch the creature he has named dolfie 
i got my binoculars a nice bench and ive been watching her 
every single day said soto this is my vacation spot right 
here 
the 5footlong dolphin on monday stubbornly resisted marine 
biologists efforts to herd it out of the murky river waters to open 
sea by banging on pipes in the water 
the experts dont know why the creature wont leave the small 
area in the river south of wards island said sam sadove the 
research director at the okeanos ocean research foundation inc on 
new yorks long island 
he said its possible the dolphins sonar is impaired 
another theory is that the sonar is working but is picking up 
changes in the water that make it think there is a barrier he 
added 
based on tests on the water monday marine biologists determined 
that the animal could remain in the river for up to three to four 
weeks without serious impact 
but if the dolphin becomes stressed its chances of survival 
decline 
it can die very quickly its just like a human in shock with 
changes in color pallor and breathing rate sadove said 
nelson hernandez an 11yearold who wants to be a marine 
biologist when he grows up is also concerned the river could mean 
death for the dolphin 
they say the water is dirty so he might be dying this water 
may be polluting his body said the youngster as he leaned over 
the esplanade railing to see the animal better 
gregory rivera a doorman who lives in the neighborhood pointed 
with amazement at the dolphin when he spotted it for the first time 
there it is see him right there 
myram pochynok a new york telephone employee munching on pizza 
during his lunch break also joined the excitement saying 
its one of the best things to hit the east river you usually 
see all kinds of other stuff floating in the water its nice to see 
something that belongs there 
dolphins certainly belong in the water but not in the east 
rivers water marine experts said and sadove said the foundation 
will continue its efforts to drive the dolphin to sea as soon as it 
has assembled the necessary equipment 
plans include use of large underwater speakers to play the scary 
sounds of killer whales in hopes that the dolphin will swim away 
from them and toward the ocean he said 
if that doesnt work marine biologists will string 100 yards of 
acoustic pingers between two boats to create a moving wall of sound 
we would move that wall progressively toward the dolphin in the

it wasnt love at first bite for two rare 
sumatran tigers matched through an animalmating computer service 
but zoo officials here are confident the affair will blossom with 
time 
dutch a 4yearold male from blidorp zoo in rotterdam holland 
met germanborn tuka 10 on monday in the tiger display at the 
lowry park zoological garden 
the two initially faced off warily tuka growled dutch took a 
swim 
shes snarling in a defensive posture explained zoo curator 
lex salisbury they could fight but other tiger introductions 
have been pretty good 
the tigers are indigenous to the asian island of sumatra and 
number about 700 in the wild said salisbury seventy of the 
endangered animals are in captivity 50 of those live in north 
american zoos 
the tigers are hunted for their rich orangeandblack striped 
coats and are being pushed out of their forest habitat by 
development 
dutch was donated to the zoo may 11 and tuka was loaned 
indefinitely six months ago by the san diego wild animal park 
the matchmaker was the american association of zoological parks 
and aquariums in apple valley minn 
its 3yearold computer program is called arks animal record 
keeping system 
one goal is to reintroduce babies produced by computer couples 
back into the wild salisbury said 
before their first date the tigers had only sniffed each other 
nose to nose in separate cages salisbury said 
it may be a while before they warm up and before they mate 
salisbury said after dutch ignored tuka to plunge into a moat 
they could breed tomorrow or a few months from now theres also a 
remote chance that they wont breed at all

members of a military tribunal have called for the 
courtmartial and execution of a highly decorated senior general who 
admitted to trafficking in cocaine ivory diamonds and other 
contraband 
gen arnaldo ochoa 57 told the panel of his peers that he had 
betrayed the revolution he held so dear but that none of his actions 
were meant to discredit it or the government of fidel castro 
staterun television has broadcast segments of the hearing before 
the 47 generals and admirals that began sunday including a 
30minute statement by ochoa who was charged with masterminding 
smuggling operations run by officers 
cuban media said viewers unaccustomed to such public show trials 
were transfixed by the proceedings against one of cubas most 
decorated war heroes 
ochoa received one of his countrys highest honors for his work 
as commander of cuban troops in angola in 198788 where cuba 
supported the marxist government against westernbacked rebels 
if this death sentence were to come which could even even 
include a firing squad my last throught will be for fidel and our 
great revolution the general told the tribunal in the statement 
broadcast tuesday night 
throughout the hearing ochoa looked dejected sometimes toying 
with a piece of string as members of the panel talked 
on tuesday the tribunal ruled that ochoa had committed treason 
and recommended he be courtmartialed 
witnesses who testified during the hearing said that beginning 
as early as 1985 ochoa was in league with colombian drug bosses and 
had helped turn cuba into a way station for usbound cocaine 
the government news agency prensa latina said tuesday that 
officers who testified before the tribunal all said ochoa had 
persuaded them to raise dollars at all costs to help this 
communist nations troubled economy 
in addition to drug trafficking ochoa is accused of overseeing a 
thriving black market trade in supplies provided to the troops he 
commanded in angola 
prensa latina said he traded fuel dried fish and beef weapons 
electronics and other supplies for diamonds and dollars 
the witnesses said some of the money he made ended up a 
panamanian bank account some was used to buy refrigerators and 
stereos for ochoa and other officers they said 
some of the generals on the tribunal were angered by the 
testimony while others choked backed tears 
some younger officers said they rose through the ranks regarding 
ochoa as a hero older officers mentioned their 30year friendships 
with ochoa and their common combat experience dating to the 
guerrilla war in the sierra maestra that ended with the 1959 victory 
of the castroled revolution 
nearly to a man however they recommended that ochoa be stripped 
of his rank and honors and be dishonorably discharged most asked 
that he be given the maximum penalty death by firing squad 
one pays for treason with ones life said ochoa whose voice 
grew husky at times 
he told the panel he was ashamed of his actions and recognized 
his mistakes but denied he wanted to embarrass the government it 
was to be expected that the enemy would try to use this but nothing 
is further from the truth than this having been for political 
motives 
the general also denied the castros or any other toplevel cuban 
government officials were involved in drugrunning 
neither the commanderinchief fidel castro nor the defense 
minister nor the party nor the armed forces ever had anything to 
do with this i wanted to make this clear before you ochoa 
told his colleagues 
authorities had said the courtmartial proceedings might begin 
tuesday but by early today there was no word that they had begun 
defense minister raul castro brother of the president testified 
that ochoas punishment should set an example 
the tribunal recommended that the full weight of the law be 
applied because of the extreme seriousness of his crimes 
capt jorge martinez valdez ochoas assistant had testified 
that ochoa began laundering money with panamanians and colombians in 
1985 
he said ochoa had direct contacts with leaders of the medellin 
cartel the worlds largest cocainesmuggling operation he said the 
colombian drug lords thought that we were official representatives 
of cuba

the debate over the export of logs grown on 
state and federal forests in oregon shifts to congress after voters 
gave overwhelming support to a measure intended to save jobs at 
local mills 
the measure which would ban the export of logs cut from 
stateowned forests will become effective only if congress adopts 
enabling legislation the ban would not effect logs already 
processed into lumber 
the measure also calls on congress to permanently ban the export 
of logs grown on the national forests and other federal timberlands 
the bush administration has proposed lifting the annual ban on 
exporting federal logs to boost federal revenue by an estimated 200 
million 
in tuesdays election a count of 99 percent of the votes showed 
the measure passing with 421991 or 90 percent to 44604 or 10 
percent 
this is the greatest present oregon could give me trying to get 
this bill through said sen bob packwood rore adding he has 
lined up 20 cosponsors for the bill on federal log exports and 16 
for the bill on state exports 
financing for the 800000 citzens to save oregon jobs campaign 
came largely from nonexporting timber companies afraid that failure 
of the measure could have led to a lifting of the ban on federal log 
exports 
weyerhaeuser co spokesman kelly conover said the proposal to 
keep logs grown on oregon state forests exclusively for use in 
oregon mills faced constitutional problems because it created a 
barrier to interstate commerce 
conover said counties and school districts receiving revenues 
from the sale of logs grown on state forests were likely to go to 
court to protest the loss of the premium prices paid by buyers from 
japan china and korea 
the campaign spent 15 million and failed to tell oregonians 
what their real problem is for the industry which is federal timber 
supply conover said 
federal logs are already in short supply because of court 
injunctions barring timber sales in old growth forests that 
environmentalists say are critical to the survival of the rare 
northern spotted owl 
the us forest service has estimated that lifting the ban on 
federal log exports could send an additional 1 billion board feet of 
raw timber from oregon and washington forests to japan china and 
korea 
about 13 billion board feet of logs from oregon primarily cut 
on private lands were exported last year out of a statewide harvest 
of 9 billion board feet of the state forest harvest of 220 million 
board feet about half was exported 
the measure drew no organized opposition but the pacific rim 
trade association complained that supporters misled the public about 
the threat of state log exports to domestic mill jobs

one by one they emerged from the airport 
terminal most leaning heavily on crutches with just one leg they 
are victims of a tragedy that began almost seven months ago as the 
earth shook under armenia 
bound for surgery in israel these survivors of the dec 7 
earthquake that killed 25000 people and injured thousands more are 
still haunted by visions of collapsing buildings 
they bear the scars of emergency surgery and are left with stumps 
that promise a life as social misfits 
i want my left leg to heal so that i would have at least one 
leg and i want to be able to walk normally like young women do i 
want to be able to do everything at home to be a good housewife 
said alyona berchuliak 
berchuliak an attractive 19yearold with dark hair had bigger 
plans she was a graduate student working on a construction site and 
planned a career as a construction site manager 
but that was before she was trapped in the ruins of a ninestory 
dormitory in leninakan armenias secondlargest city 
we finished our postgraduate practice and were gathering our 
belongings to return home when the earthquake started said 
berchuliak 
we tried to run out but the door was stuck the lock was 
broken 
now confined to a wheelchair berchuliak lost her right leg 
doctors diagnosed multiple fractures in her left leg and she has 
suffered from kidney complications 
unemployed berchuliak was recognized as an invalid of the 
first group by the state which entitled her to a monthly 75ruble 
pension about 10 on the soviet black market 
i am sorry but its impossible to live on that she said 
even so berchuliak is more fortunate than some she was among 61 
earthquake survivors 49 of whom are amputees who were flown to 
israel for medical treatment tuesday on mission healing which 
is funded by the american jewish joint distribution committee 
aryeh cooperstock an american who coordinated the project said 
many of the amputees are suffering the effects of inadequate 
hastily performed emergency surgery 
they did the best they could under the circumstances he 
said but in order to fit prosthetic limbs other preparatory 
surgery has to be done 
israeli officials saw the mercy mission in which a jetliner of 
the national el al airlines flew to soviet union for the first time 
as a further thaw in relations 
this definitely shows we are experiencing a new relationship 
with the soviet union said health minister yaakov tzur who met 
the mercy flight at the airport tuesday night 
moscow cut diplomatic relations with israel after the 1967 middle 
east war in a show of solidarity with arab nations the soviets are 
also the major arms supplier for israels arab enemies 
arieh levin head of the israeli consular delegation in moscow 
suggested there was a struggle in the kremlin between proarab 
officials and those favoring closer ties with israel 
our friends in the soviet leadership are looking for signs of 
good will from israel in order to build on them toward an 
amelioration of the soviet policy towards israel levin said 
narine balayan social welfare minister for the republic of 
armenia told reporters at a reception in yerevan i hope the time 
will come when planes like yours will land in yerevan without any 
disaster having prompted their visit 
about 40 other amputees from armenia have been flown to western 
countries for treatment armenian officials said the soviet union 
cannot produce prosthetic limbs of the same quality 
the soviet union has plans to build factories to make articial 
arms and legs with the help of west germany and donations from 
lebanese armenians but the estimated 500 quake survivors with 
missing limbs may wait for long to get prostheses without treatment 
abroad 
some of the amputees have already received prostheses in the 
united states this group is now leaving for israel and another 
group is to go abroad in autumn said the republics deputy social 
welfare minister zaven manuchian 
we dont want the foreign aid to be a onetime action we want 
to be able to produce prostheses ourselves according to the world 
standards he said speaking outside the redbrick airport 
terminal as crippled survivors slowly struggled to the waiting the 
boeing 757 
the survivors may eventually receive artificial limbs and find 
their way back into society but some of their wounds will never 
heal 
like those of egor khatchaturian 17 who lost 18 classmates when 
his school collapsed in the city of spitak khatchaturian who lost 
his left leg burst into tears as he recalled the terrible moment of 
their death 
sylvia gevorkian 51 kept adding the word killed to the list 
of relatives when asked if she had lost family in the quake 
daughter killed she said in a lifeless voice 
granddaughter killed

treasure hunters and archaeologists are 
hoping a ship found off the florida keys in 1500 feet of water will 
turn out to be the remains of a treasureladen 17thcentury spanish 
galleon 
seahawk deep ocean technology of tampa today planned to disclose 
videotapes made by remotecontrolled cameras of the shipwreck the 
ship could be the nuestra senora de la merced a spanish galleon 
believed to have vanished during a hurricane in 1622 
its worth a fortune in history said greg stemm a tampa 
businessman who hopes to recover the riches 
another galleon that sank in the same hurricane the nuestra 
senora de atocha was found laden with gold and silver by treasure 
hunter mel fisher in 1985 about 50 miles north of stemms discovery 
jim miller floridas state archaeologist who already viewed the 
videos of the ship wreck said the finds historical value is 
significant because although the ships structure has collapsed 
its cargo wood and organic materials have been wellpreserved 
this particular wreck is more like a time capsule it sank and 
it hasnt been touched since that time miller said 
last weekend salvors aboard stemms 85foot research vessel 
seahawk retrieved the ships bell that will be used to strengthen 
his companys federal admiralty claim to the wreck admiralty law 
governs shipwrecks found in international waters in this case 
more than 12 miles from the us coast 
by summers end the salvors will begin a fullscale operation to 
retrieve the fragile artifacts and confirm the ships identity 
so far they have discovered a number of jars that could be 
filled with wine food and other commodities the artifacts looked 
to be piled in a mound about 100by30 feet miller said 
if stemms research proves correct the wreck he discovered could 
hold a treasure worth millions 
were going to profit tremendously said stemm 32 coowner 
of a deepsea research company that discovered the sunken vessel in 
april

student leader wuer kaixi in a videotape made 
after fleeing china has made a dramatic vow to continue the 
struggle for democracy and predicted the wild beast communist 
leadership will soon fall 
this kind of government doesnt have the strength to continue 
living wuer said in the 18minute videotape shown today to the 
associated press they are the peoples enemies 
wuer escaped from china with his girlfriend liu yan despite a 
nationwide manhunt in which his picture was posted in airports and 
train stations 
he was easily the most charismatic of the 21 student leaders 
accused by communist authorities of inciting counterrevolutionary 
rebellion 
authorities ordered his arrest as part of the crackdown on 
dissent in china that began june 34 when soldiers attacked unarmed 
prodemocracy demonstrators in beijing killing hundreds 
wuer at times choking back tears made several emotional 
references to the people killed during that battle in which much of 
the fighting raged along changan street that runs into tiananmen 
square 
i dont know how many martyrs souls remain on changan street 
may they forever rest in peace 
those of us who remain alive our lives no longer belong to 
ourselves he said the lives of those classmates and countrymen 
who sacrificed themselves for democracy for freedom and for our 
beautiful motherland have dissolved into our own 
he urged those who participated in the campaign for freedom to 
focus our will and continue the great patriotic democratic 
movement until the end if we dont get our act together we 
wont be able to get moving and china will never advance 
wuer who looked pale in the videotape wore a white tshirt 
with the name of his school beijing normal university on the 
front he said the statement was made about two weeks after the 
beijing bloodbath he did not say where he was videotaped 
during the statement wuer attacked chinas conservative leaders 
deng xiaoping premier li peng and president yang shangkun whom 
he repeatedly referred to as fascists and at one point called 
them a band of reactionary warlords 
he said the chinese leaders will be judged by history how can 
i describe them they are a small stumbling block on the road of 
history 
he predicted the chinese leaders would remain in power six months 
to three years it wont be longer this government will 
definitely fall 
wuer gave an account of his own ordeal describing how he left 
tiananmen square the night of the military sweep spitting up blood 
from an apparent ulcer 
he shared an ambulance with a dying classmate whose stomach was 
still gurgling blood from bullet wounds and a soldier shot by his 
own troops apparently by mistake 
the student leader claimed many people were killed in 
tiananmen denying the governments contention that nobody died in 
the square 
a lot of my classmates were crushed to death by tanks they 
were completely flattened by tanks on tiananmen square wuer said 
there were innumerable tribulations and a narrow escape from 
death but im still alive he said 
he acknowledged that he and other prodemocracy protesters were 
naive to think the communist government would tolerate their 
peaceful demonstrations 
but we never thought the shamelessness and viciousness of 
those wild beasts would go to such an extent he said 
wuer remains in hiding in the west 
the videotape is the second of his statements released by 
activists in an underground network that has helped more than a 
dozen participants in the prodemocracy movement escape the chinese 
crackdown 
a black sun has appeared in the sky of my motherland and 
republic wuer said in a handwritten letter dated june 15 and 
shown to the ap this week 
but our life is young stubborn and uncrushable black sun 
im going to shoot you down

the food and drug administration is 
investigating an unauthorized clinical trial of an experimental aids 
drug from china in which one patient died 
organizers of the study involving compound q a purified extract 
of a protein from the root tubers of chinese cucumbers defended 
their actions under the fdas socalled compassionate use policy for 
experimental drugs 
it would be foolish not to give the benefits of research coming 
out of an individuals use of this drug ethically morally and 
legally it is the correct and proper thing to do said curtis 
ponzi an attorney for san franciscobased project inform a 
nonprofit group that helped set up the trial 
the fda under its socalled compassionate use decision allows 
individuals to import personal use quantities of experimental 
drugs largescale importation of unapproved products for commercial 
use is prohibited 
dr alan levin a san francisco immunologist who helped set up 
the study said the program is at least six months ahead of mainline 
research on the drugs efficacy and contended he could have dosage 
recommendations within three months 
what were doing is legally compassionate and not at all in 
violation of any laws said levin 
of the 42 patients from california new york and florida three 
showed adverse reactions and one died saturday possibly from side 
effects induced by the drug levin said the patient was in the 
advanced stages of aids 
levin said another 33 patients had received the drug but were not 
part of the study however levin issued a public plea to aids 
patients asking them not to inject themselves with the drug without 
medical supervision several people have been injured after 
obtaining bootlegged supplies of the potent drug 
in a statement issued late tuesday fda spokesman brad stone said 
the agency would investigate the underground trial because the 
exact circumstances surrounding the death and other adverse 
reactions reported to have occurred in this trial have not been 
ascertained 
it said questions also have been raised about the composition of 
the drug in the project inform trial and whether it was illegally 
imported 
violating fda policy on distributing unapproved drugs could 
result in seizure of the material cease and desist orders or in 
rare cases mostly involving forprofit schemes criminal penalties 
fred ponder who is helping project inform organize the trial 
said the equivalent of 225 doses were brought into the country from 
shanghai by a los angeles nurse who had to bribe officials in 
another country to get it out 
the patients under monitoring by nine physicians all showed 
clinical improvement with reductions averaging 50 percent of the 
p24 antigen a key indicator of viral activity caued by aids 
infection said levin he added the drug produced its best effects 
in those least ill from the disease 
our scientific procedures are very good and rigorous said 
levin he and his wife dr vera byers designed the trial 
i resent people calling us underground illegal or guerrilla 
groups said levin were not amateurs were firstclass 
doctors 
compound q is trichosanthin a protein derived from chinese 
cucumber root tubers it has been used for centuries in china to 
induce abortions and more recently to treat some forms of skin 
cancer it can produce severe side effects because it acts as a 
temporary immune supressor said levin 
a highly purified form of trichosanthin called glq223 was 
approved by the fda in april for human testing in two years of 
testtube and animal studies it appeared to selectively kill key 
cells called macrophages that are believed to harbor the aids virus 
according to figures from the centers for disease control in 
atlanta 97193 americans have contracted aids since june 1981 
through may 1989 of those 55673 have died

president bush is weighing proposals to curb 
specialinterest influence in political campaigns end 
gerrymandering and keep track of efforts by members of congress to 
influence executive branch policy administration officials said 
today 
in addition bush will propose pay raises for judges top 
executive branch officials and members of congress said one source 
who spoke on condition of anonymity his proposal did not include a 
specific figure as of today the source said 
proposals bush is to announce thursday the official said would 
abolish specialinterest political action committees that pour 
millions of dollars into the campaign war chests of federal 
candidates 
end the gerrymandering practice of drawing political district 
lines to benefit one party republicans have tended to fare badly 
with many state legislatures which draw up the districts controlled 
by democrats 
call for a pay raise across the branches of government 
congress quashed a 51 percent pay raise in february in the face of 
public outrage 
in addition the president is considering a proposal to log calls 
from members of congress trying to sway officials decisions said 
the source 
as part of his campaign reform proposals bush is considering new 
restrictions on socalled soft money a term generally referring 
to croporate and union money which although barred from federal 
campaign finds its way into campaign funds through loopholes 
one toplevel official said bush is looking at more complete 
disclosure of such funds that could entail opening the books of the 
national republican and democratic parties which are among the 
primary recipients of such contributions 
meanwhile the washington post reported in todays editions that 
bush also would emphasize enforcement of the voting rights act in 
his speech to congressional interns at the library of congress 
among the items on which bush is making decisions the official 
said are 
barring members of congress from carrying excess campaign funds 
over from one election to the next members who win their races 
handily sometimes amass huge war chests by rolling over the funds 
from election to election 
limiting the amount congressional incumbents can spend on 
mailings with their franking privileges critics say these 
mailings to constituents give the incumbents unfair advantage over 
election challengers at taxpayer expense 
banning corporate or labor union pacs while allowing those that 
are not connected to such groups socalled ideological pacs that 
are centered on a political philosophy 
the president also is considering lowering the current 5000 per 
candidate limit for pac contributions to 1000 the official said 
current law allows individuals to contribute up to 1000 per 
candidate in each election while pacs may give 5000 
bush previously said he wanted to do away with pacs which in the 
1988 election gave 1513 million to house and senate candidates 
according to federal election commission records bushs own 
presidential campaign got 862950 in pac money 
but he did not previously discuss separating out the ideological 
pacs bush aides said these are considered more acceptable because 
they do not represent a specific financial interest 
however the banned category would include leadership pacs formed 
by many politicians including bush when he was vice president to 
raise campaign funds and give them to other candidates 
such pacs however are seen as having a far more beneficial role 
for potential presidential candidates who use them to fund their 
travel and coalitionbuilding during the months before they announce 
their candidacies 
bush on tuesday reiterated his opposition to public financing of 
congressional campaigns 
currently the presidential primary campaigns operate with 
federal funds on a matching basis while the general election 
presidential campaigns are entirely federally funded the money 
comes from a voluntary 1 checkoff on individual income tax forms 
the pac bush founded before he became a presidential candidate 
called fund for americas future was the second largest of about 
4000 pacs that filed records with the federal election comission in 
198586 
the bush pac raised 94 million in the years when it was most 
active the 198586 campaign cycle second only to the conservative 
congressional club founded by sen jesse helms rnc the 
congressional club and its affiliated groups raised 166 million 
by contrast the largest corporate pac was the atampt pac which 
raised 18 million fec records show 
of laborrelated pacs the teamsters had the largest raising 
44 million that cycle among the trade associationrelated pacs 
the realtors pac raised 57 million and the american medical 
association pac raised just under 5 million 
in the 198788 election cycle bushs pac raised just under 2 
million as his presidential campaign geared up

the house overwhelmingly passed a bill today 
that could lead to freedom for a mother who has been jailed for 22 
months in a bitter child custody battle 
the house on a 37634 vote approved legislation that sets a 
12month limit for civil contempt jailings in the district of 
columbia 
rep frank wolf rva the bill sponsor said the legislation 
would be applied retroactively to dr elizabeth morgan 
morgan has been incarcerated since august 1987 for failing to 
produce her daughter hilary for courtordered visits with dr eric 
foretich morgans exhusband and the girls father 
morgan hid hilary after alleging that foretich sexually abused 
the child charges foretich has repeatedly denied hilarys 
whereabouts are unknown 
the bill breezed through the house despite protests that it 
unfairly interferes with a court case and sets a dangerous precedent 
for future child custody disputes 
if this is such a good idea we should have done it for all 50 
states rep herbert bateman rva said during floor debate 
tuesday 
but wolf said congress doesnt have the authority to do it for 
all the states 
congress has review power over all district of columbia laws but 
rarely uses its right to intervene in city government or the court 
system 
morgans case is before the citys appeals court which is 
reviewing dc superior court judge herbert dixons may 11 decision 
to keep her behind bars 
dont apply it just to dr morgans case apply it to others 
and see if it fits said rep richard durbin dill i have no 
doubt that this case is based on conscience but tomorrows case may 
be malice 
wolf and others argued that morgan has demonstrated her resolve 
by remaining in jail and in any event deserves the right to a jury 
trial 
under terms of the bill the us attorney for the district of 
columbia would be required to file criminal contempt of court 
charges before a person has been jailed for 12 months or set the 
person free 
stephen sachs morgans attorney has repeatedly pleaded for 
dixon to file criminal contempt charges against morgan so she can 
receive a jury trial 
this bill hurts hilary because it provides no guarantee she 
will be returned said elaine mittleman foretichs lawyer dr 
foretichs rights as a father are being absolutely violated 
before morgan can be freed a bill sponsored by utah republican 
orrin hatch must pass the senate 
wolfs bill is modeled on similar legislation in wisconsin and 
california

meet the new who a little older grayer and 
quieter but still able to deliver the goods with a punch 
before a packed house tuesday night at radio city music hall the 
who played virtually its entire 1969 tommy rock opera in a 
benefit for autistic and abused children 
it was a different who however with a muted pete townshend 
mostly playing acoustic guitar because of severe hearing problems 
from years of playing loud electric guitar he had help on lead 
guitar from steve bolton who added a 1980s flavor to the bands 
60s standards 
john entwistles superb bass at times seemed to overpower the 
other band members but there was added support from a fivemember 
horn section three backup singers drummer simon phillips and 
percussionist jodi linscott roger daltrey and towshend were both in 
fine voice 
the who raced through an hourlong uninterrupted tommy 
bringing the audience to its feet with pinball wizard im 
free and were not gonna take it 
townshend who wrote tommy went through as many guitars as 
he did in the old days but this time they all went off stage in one 
piece one of daltreys two tamborines was the only casualty 
the rock opera with its muddled story line about a deaf dumb 
and blind kid whos cured and becomes a rock celebrity was first 
performed in london in 1969 it was made into a movie by ken russell 
in 1975 starring daltrey annmargret oliver reed eric clapton 
keith moon and elton john as the pinball wizard the royal canadian 
ballet did its own version and the london symphony orchestra did a 
recording 
tommy has a rather mystical quality with its songs about 
pinball mobs and spiritualism 
townshend once joked about tommy saying rock critics and 
many fans took it seriously but that it was really just light 
entertainment 
after performing tommy the band returned for an encore 
which also lasted an hour townshend picked up an electric guitar 
for cant explain and the who had the audience on its feet 
again clapping and singing along to such who classics as behind 
blue eyes love rein oer me and a sizzling wont get 
fooled again 
the who plans one other performance of tommy in los angeles

a justice department task force is floating the 
idea of requiring weapons purchasers to obtain a national gun 
owners identity card but attorney general dick thornburgh wont 
endorse it a spokesman said today 
david runkel commenting on a proposal contained in a lengthy 
list of guncontrol options published this week said thornburgh 
is opposed to that and would not recommend it to the president 
he feels thats an infringement on rights of americans and 
believes that is not the way to tackle this problem the spokesman 
said 
thornburgh opposed a similar plan that was advanced in the 1970s 
when he was assistant attorney general in charge of the justice 
departments criminal division runkel said 
the card plan has been strongly opposed by organizations of gun 
owners 
the task force study was required by congress last year as part 
of antidrug legislation congress noting that illegal weapons play 
an increasing role in the epidemic of illegal drugs ordered a 
review of ways to try to keep felons from buying guns 
the 40page study published monday in the federal register 
outlined a variety of possibilities grouped along two general 
approaches 
one method would be aimed at potential gun buyers and would 
require them to show certification that they have no criminal record 
the second involves the countrys 270000 gun dealers and would 
require them to check with local and federal police agencies to 
quickly search computerized records before making any of the 75 
million annual weapons deals 
the identity card has long been opposed by the national rifle 
association along with civil liberties groups 
the task force noted that opposition we are keenly aware of 
the significant concerns about protecting the privacy interests of 
all citizens the panel said 
it did not recommend whether any of the options should actually 
be implemented nor did it spell out which firearms would be 
involved 
president bush a lifelong member of the nra has proposed a 
permanent ban on the importation of semiautomatic assaultstyle 
rifles 
the firearm owners identification card could be applied for long 
before a person intended to purchase a gun it would be 
electronically encoded with information about an individuals 
background and the card could be decoded by machines that would be 
available to gun dealers 
currently there is no requirement at the federal level for any 
check of the eligibility of a gun purchaser but 29 states and the 
district of columbia require that a prepurchase check be made of an 
individuals criminal history 
the study also lists a variety of other options including 
centralized record keeping to replace the current hodgepodge of 
widely scattered files live electronic scans of buyers 
fingerprints by gun dealers at the time of purchase and telephone 
checks of police records costs of the programs range up to 10 
billion the panel noted 
the panel didnt attempt to figure out ways to identify other 
persons aside from convicted felons who try to buy guns that task 
should be done by a private contractor and such a study is now in 
the planning stages the task force said 
the study was ordered by congress last fall shortly before it 
adjourned for the year as the chamber wrote a package of antidrug 
legislation 
one proposal proposed as part of the bill called for a sevenday 
waiting period before a handgun could be purchased opponents said a 
study should be done before any waiting period was imposed and the 
plan published monday was designed to meet that requirement

china has recalled all of its foreign ambassadors 
but officials refused to confirm the move was linked to the fallout 
from the crackdown on prodemocracy demonstrators 
western leaders kept up their criticism of the suppression of 
dissent which left hundreds dead 
in an emotional videotape seen today one of the student leaders 
of the prodemocracy movement vowed from hiding to continue the 
fight and predicted the wild beast chinas communist 
leadership soon will fall 
a cultural attache at chinas embassy in kenya confirmed that all 
envoys would be called back to beijing for a general meeting he 
denied the recall was connected to the crackdown which began june 
34 
but in washington a spokeswoman at the chinese embassy said 
ambassador han xu will remain in washington she declined comment 
when asked why han was not returning to beijing 
embassies in west germany italy yugoslavia the philippines 
australia turkey egypt spain poland and belgium were among those 
that said their ambassadors had left or would return to beijing soon 
the most common reason given for the return of the ambassadors 
was for scheduled vacation or annual home leave 
the foreign ministry in beijing had no immediate comment on the 
reports 
in tokyo ambassador yang zhenya told education minister takeo 
nishioka that he was going home as part of a general recall japans 
kyodo news service reported 
a western diplomat in beijing said the ambassadors meeting would 
take place july 7 
we assume theyre going to give them the government line and 
tell them to go out and sell it and stop your people from 
defecting the diplomat said speaking on condition of anonymity 
a week ago china urged the more than 20 chinese diplomats who 
had defected to return home saying they were led astray by 
misinformation 
britain said tuesday that three first secretaries at the chinese 
embassy in london had asked for political asylum 
the western diplomat noted that china recalled all its 
ambassadors during the 196676 cultural revolution when the nation 
cut almost all contacts with the outside world 
chinas 11 billion people were told today to rally behind a june 
9 speech by senior leader deng xiaoping in which he praised the 
military for crushing the prodemocracy movement 
deng contends the studentled movement for democratic reforms 
turned into a counterrevolutionary rebellion and said in the speech 
that china must never waver in its opposition to bourgeois 
liberalization or western ideas 
deng said china must not back away from economic reforms but said 
ideological education is needed to show people that such reforms can 
only succeed under the guidance of the communist party 
all major dailies carried dengs speech in full on their front 
pages the noon news devoted 15 minutes to reading the entire text 
deng 84 reportedly ordered the military assault on beijing and 
his speech has become the gospel for hardliners seeking to root out 
all dissent in the party and government 
china has been sharply criticized by many nations for using 
troops to drive prodemocracy protesters out of central beijings 
tiananmen square in an assault that left scores of people dead 
official chinese reports say nearly 300 people died including 
nearly 100 soldiers and police chinese witnesses and western 
intelligence sources say the death toll may have been as high as 
3000 
at least 1800 protesters and activists have been arrested and 
27 people have been executed for alleged roles in antigovernment 
protests that broke out in response to the crackdown 
one of those who escaped arrest is wuer kaixi a student protest 
leader who fled china after he was accused of inciting 
counterrevolutionary rebellion and ordered arrested 
this kind of government doesnt have the strength to continue 
living wuer said in an 18minute videotape shown today to the 
associated press 
those of us who remain alive our lives no longer belong to 
ourselves he said at times choking back tears 
he urged those who participated in the campaign to focus our 
will and continue the great patriotic democratic movement until the 
end if we dont get our act together we wont be able to get 
moving and china will never advance 
he said the statement was made about two weeks after the military 
crackdown in tiananmen he did not say where it was videotaped 
since the crackdown the united states has cut off arms sales and 
canceled all highlevel visits to china 
the european economic community on tuesday urged similar steps by 
its 12 members and joined washington in recommending that the world 
bank postpone new loans to beijing 
japan chinas most important source of development aid has 
suspended talks on new loans 
china has criticized the united states for interfering in its 
internal affairsbut has generally tried to shrug off its growing 
diplomatic isolation by saying it hopes foreign contacts and trade 
will quickly return to normal 
chinas legislature the national peoples congress is to 
convene a special meeting thursday to endorse the party line and act 
on a draft bill that will tighten regulations on the holding of 
rallies and demonstrations

the case of a us soldier 
sentenced to 30 years in prison for giving military secrets to east 
germany will be reviewed by a general who may reduce the sentence 
an army spokesman said wednesday 
michael a peri of laguna niguel calif pleaded guilty to 
espionage last week during his courtmartial in fulda where he was 
based with the 11th armored cavalry regiment near the east german 
border 
before he was sentenced saturday the 22yearold intelligence 
analyst tearfully begged forgiveness for leaving his unit in 
february and turning over defense plans to the east germans he 
denied receiving any money for the plans 
under a pretrial agreement peris 30year sentence will be 
reduced to 25 years if he serves the first three with good behavior 
peri also received a dishonorable discharge lost his pay and 
benefits and was demoted from specialist four to the armys lowest 
rank private 1 
the case must be reviewed by lt gen john w woodmansee the 
commander of the us armys 5th corps in frankfurt said corps 
spokesman maj samuel taylor 
gen woodmansee as the convening authority for the case 
automatically reviews it and if he finds grounds to do so can 
choose to reduce the sentence taylor said 
the case then is sent to the us court of military review in 
falls church va for review 
even if woodmansee chooses to reduce the sentence the review 
court can further reduce it they can never increase it so all of 
this is in peris favor taylor said 
peri can ask that the case be reviewed again by a panel of three 
civilian judges at the court of military appeals in washington and 
as a last resort he can petition the us supreme court 
peri left the 11th regiment on feb 20 and went to east germany 
with a portable army computer and discs containing classified 
material 
he returned voluntarily march 4 the regiment is responsible for 
frontline defense if soviet bloc forces attack 
peri said he left because he was frustrated with his job as an 
intelligence analyst and electronic signal intercepter 
military officials described him as a model soldier before his 
disappearance 
peri is being held at an army jail in mannheim pending transfer 
to the militarys disciplinary barracks at fort leavenworth kan

on the supreme courts decision on burning the flag 
 
june 22 
the lufkin texas daily news 
what could be as repugnant as burning an american flag 
a few things come close a cross burning in a front yard 
antisemitic statements scrawled across the side of a wall the 
humiliating harangue of an ethnic slur 
all of these things are allowed and protected as free speech 
under the constitution of the united states 
the fact is that liberty true liberty allows stupid and 
outrageous political beliefs it allows them even if no one else 
agrees it allows them even though they violate the bounds of human 
decency 
burning the flag is all of that and more it tramples on the 
sacrifices made by our fathers sons and brothers in protecting this 
nation it brands those who do it with a mark of ignorance none of 
us should ignore we may have to allow them to speak their piece 
but nothing commands us to listen 
but ironically the supreme court decision saying flagburning 
is legal takes something away from those who would do it let them 
take to the streets of moscow havana or beijing burn the flags of 
those nations and they will not find the same freedom of expression 
as painful as it is the supreme court decision shows again why 
america is different as long as that difference remains the flag 
stands for something that can never be burned

kennebec journal augusta maine 
the outcry against the supreme court flagburning decision may be 
shortlived we are not dealing with an issue which involves enormous 
social and legal dilemmas such as abortion 
the concerns are symbolic going to the intent of how a flag is 
burned burning after all is the recommended method for disposal 
of worn flags so the physical act is irrelevant to the courts 
decision 
what is involved is what are we to do when an isolated protester 
burns the flag as an affront to the vast majority of americans who 
consider themselves patriotic and to the flag as a symbol of 
national unity and resolve 
do we punish the protester and possibly send him to jail or do 
we tolerate even an act we hate as a measure of our commitment to 
unfettered political speech

the joplin mo globe 
the supreme court siphoned off much of the symbolism from the 
american flag to which symbolism is everything a majority of five 
justices reasoned if you can call it that that the first 
amendment protects protesters who burn the flag in political 
demonstrations in addition to sparking outrage from millions of 
americans the court invalidated flagdesecration laws in 48 states 
 
of course the flag the visible symbol embodying the nation is 
worthy of sensible care protected political speech is vital but not 
invulnerable to perceive obscene treatment of the flag as a command 
of the constitution is an obscenity in itself

the news dispatch michigan city ind 
burning the flag may be a distasteful form of expression and 
it may be extremely wrongheaded but you cant protect the most 
reasoned and inspired free speech without at the same time 
protecting the speech of those who are wrong and perhaps even 
outrageous 
and burning or desecrating the flag does nothing to harm what the 
flag symbolizes there is delicious irony in the fact that a 
flagburner who thinks he is trashing the country and its system 
actually illustrates the remarkable amount of freedom we enjoy 
the flag bless it and what it stands for can take a little 
free speech and come back for more

the journal new ulm minn 
the justices are right the flag is a symbol of our country 
and the freedoms we enjoy one of those freedoms is freedom of 
expression the symbol should not be more important than the freedom 
itself 
in a way the flag may never look as noble as it does when it is 
going up in flames in the hands of protestors the flag is being 
given up as a sacrifice for the right of the protestors to make 
their point as they see fit in burning a flag a protestor gives 
the flag a dignity and nobility he himself will never have 
let them burn the flag they will not be able to burn out the 
ideas and freedoms the flag represents the flag will wave in our 
hearts long after the protest is forgotten

the newport ri daily news on the customs service 
the federal government is at it again proving that it can turn a 
silk purse into a sows ear 
this time it is the customs service that earns our ire it seems 
that despite netting more than 1 billion in property seizures in 
1988 customs managed to rack up millions in red ink 
the customs debacle is an outrage taxpayers are getting squeezed 
more each year in user fees social security taxes higher health 
costs etc we have little choice but to accept these fees but we 
need not accept ineptitude and incompetence on the part of the 
federal government

the charleston wva gazette on coal strike violence 
united mine workers members who struck the pittston coal group 
companies justly felt desperation their employer seems intent on 
breaking the union and has resorted to cutting off pensions and 
medical benefits while running a media campaign that makes the firm 
sound benevolent 
at first the strikers acted in the nonviolent tradition of 
mahatma gandhi and martin luther king they blocked coalhauling 
roads with their bodies inviting arrest in the classic style of 
civil disobedience 
but when other miners began a wildcat strike against other 
unionized mines ignoring the nostrike contract they had entered 
and idling a third of the nations coal production they turned 
increasingly to violence that damages their cause demoralizes their 
sympathizers and in west virginias case undermines their state 
 
the union plays into the companies hands by lawless conduct 
members speed the decline of their union by their actions if union 
president richard trumka or other umw officials can end the 
violence they should do so 
but no matter what anyone else should do the state of west 
virginia should enforce the law when mobs roam the land no one is 
safe

the houston post on private club membership 
it is sen lloyd bentsens business if he wants to rejoin three 
exclusive clubs from which he resigned after becoming the 1988 
democratic vice presidential nominee but he might explain why he 
felt the memberships were inappropriate for a candidate seeking high 
national office while they are all right for a united states 
senator 
bentsens spokesman jack devore says the three clubs the 
river oaks country club and ramada club of houston and the 
middleburg tennis club in virginia have no membership 
restrictions but the river oaks and middleburg clubs have no black 
members the ramada club membership has been described as mixed 
the senator was a member of the houston clubs for 25 years before 
resigning last august when he became massachusetts gov michael 
dukakis running mate at the time devore said bentsen felt it was 
the appropriate thing to do now he says associates have told 
the senator it is appropriate for him to rejoin 
the only conclusion we can draw from this is that bentsen didnt 
want the memberships to become a presidential campaign issue but no 
longer considers them a political liability how about basing it on 
what is right

despite their name the diapers are far from disposable 
after a single wearing most end up in municipal landfills where 
they provide a potential breeding ground for viruses and bacteria 
that cause polio hepatitis meningitis and other diseases 
new ways of dealing with the diapers must be found one suggested 
approach is to make the plastic liners in the diapers with 
biodegradable corn starch which supporters say causes them to

saginaw mich news on the savings and loan crisis 
having preserved some semblance of reason in the national 
insanity that is the savings and loan scandal congress should next 
seek to bring the crooks to justice 
its not enough that sampls no longer will be permitted to pretend 
that they have 20 billion in the uh bank the house last week 
refused to let them count good will as a genuine capital asset 
if public opinion is worth anything in fact at least that much has 
piled up on the debit side of he ledger 
what catches our eye in the 285 billion bailout bill is not even 
that incredible figure it is the mandate to go after the crooks who 
did a real number on the nation 
when the measure comes up for final approval early in july the 
house and senate plan to allocate at least 50 million a year to the 
justice department through 1991 to detect and prosecute fraud at 
financial institutions the maximum civil penalty for reckless 
disregard for safety will be 1 million a day the criminal 
penalties will be 1 million per day or imprisonment for up to five 
years 
sound like a lot of money hey somebodys got it 300 billion 
doesnt just evaporate there are stories of sampl bosses collecting 
8 million in bonuses as they threw money away like it wasnt theirs 
which of course it wasnt 
the justice department should bring in all the special 
prosecutors it needs to find and convict these thieves

the postcrescent appletonneenahmenasha wis on children and 
gun laws 
a new florida law imposes criminal penalties on parents whose 
loaded weapons are not kept out of the reach of their children 
in the wake of several recent shootings by wisconsin children who 
had such easy access some legislators want a similar law here 
we dont 
the key to preventing horrible accidents of this nature is not to 
lock up the weapons the key is to get children to act responsibly 
around the weapons in the first place that can best be accomplished 
not by punishing parents after their kids have shot someone but by 
educating the kids about gun safety by acting before tragedy 
strikes 
teaching children to handle guns properly is a far better 
solution than thinking that hiding guns will make the problem go 
away it wont

the columbian of vancouver wash on the hud scandal 
teapot dome the notorious tale about public servants tapping the 
federal till for private gain blots the historical view of 
president warren harding the unfolding scandal in the recent 
administrations department of housing and urban development may 
stand as an even darker mark against ronald reagan 
harding died before the extent of teapot dome was clear he 
did not have to watch secretary of interior albert b fall locked up 
for taking more than 100000 in bribes similarly reagans 
welldocumented teflon coating may keep the hud mud from sticking to 
him in the short run 
the hud scandal however shapes up as larger and more pernicious 
than teapot dome whatever else historians write about the past 
decade they must reckon with massive expropriation of federal funds 
by friends and former associates of reagan while thousands of 
families and individuals daily fought for wretched shelter while 
construction of new subsidized housing dwindled while the decay of 
existing housing stock accelerated wellconnected republicans used 
hud as a private slush fund

los angeles herald examiner on the supreme courts death penalty 
rulings 
even the most ardent advocates of capital punishment would be 
hard pressed to defend a pair of supreme court decisions authorizing 
executions for crimes committed by 16 and 17yearold teenagers 
and the mentally retarded 
while we still believe the death penalty is appropriate in 
certain circumstances such a sentence must never be taken lightly 
proponents should start by admitting that protecting society from 
specific violent killers is probably the death penaltys least 
important function in most circumstances life without parole would 
do as well and given the high cost of legal appeals at lower cost 
but given the three traditional justifications for capital 
punishment to deter those who would commit heinous crimes to 
punish those for whom rehabilitation is not possible and as an act 
of social ablution or ritual cleansing killing teenage criminals 
serves little purpose 
killing them is neither measured justice nor fitting 
retribution its a spasm of vindictiveness the least defensible of 
all motivations

a person born during the year 1900 could 
expect to live to be 50 years old today a persons life expectancy 
at birth is 75 years a full generation longer why are people 
living longer what do these extra years mean to the individual to 
the family to society 
how long a person lives depends on several factors genetics 
medical advances lifestyle and environmental assaults 
science and medicine have given us antibiotics vaccines and 
better medical care so that illnesses once fatal no longer are 
people are more aware than ever of changes in lifestyle that affect 
health eating a wellbalanced diet that limits fats and increases 
fiber exercising sensibly wearing seat belts quitting smoking 
and drinking little if any alcohol have all contributed to 
longer healthier lives governmental regulations have eliminated 
many concerns about the food we eat the water we drink and the air 
we breathe 
some 20 or 30 years ago people believed that getting old meant 
an inevitable decline of health and intellectual function in fact 
many medical textbooks still use the word senile to describe 
people who suffer confusion and memory loss and imply that this 
condition is a natural consequence of age 
today thanks to studies on normal human aging we know that 
people can live to be 100 and more with no evidence of heart disease 
or memory impairment scientists also have concluded that 
personality does not change with age in fact there are few if 
any changes that occur to all people as they grow old 
despite these results there are many people for whom aging is no 
joy i recently met a woman in her mid70s who confided no one 
ever told me that growing old hurts so much many older people 
become dependent on family members and society because of 
debilitating conditions that severely restrict their independence 
arthritis osteoporosis and alzheimers disease to name a few are 
problems for which science and society have not yet found adequate 
solutions a person should be able to remain functional and vigorous 
throughout life 
as director of the national institute on aging at the national 
institutes of health i am all too frequently asked is this what 
i have to look forward to as i grow old studies that help us to 
understand and eliminate the afflictions that rob a person of 
independence are a high priority among researchers around the world 
make no mistake we have made progress for example we have the 
expertise to treat certain forms of urinary incontinence we have 
identified the risk factors that make falls and subsequent fractures 
likely and we understand the benefits of early rehabilitation after 
stroke 
because of these and other successes many children today know 
their grandparents and even their great grandparents in many 
cases grandparents are an integral part of the family and are 
called upon to lend support to the family unit this is all very 
positive however new problems arise as many grown children are 
called upon to care for a frail parent or relative for many the 
caregiving role is fraught with doubts guilt tedium and fears and 
indeed is an area which requires innovative approaches to best serve 
all concerned 
to society the implications of the growing number of older 
people is still confusing many healthy older people do not choose 
retirement they wish to remain employed healthcare systems do not 
yet know how to respond to the growing number of people who require 
longterm care health professionals and policymakers need to sort 
out the ramifications of having so many older people in need of 
assistance 
from the day you are born you begin to age no matter how old you 
are aging issues apply i hope this information will serve to 
eliminate some of the common fears many of us have about growing old

prime minister sousuke uno chosen by the governing 
party as a mr clean to rescue it from scandal was kept busy 
wednesday denying he might resign because of allegations about his 
sexual conduct 
in exchanges with reporters throughout the day uno repeatedly 
denied reports that in meetings tuesday night leaders of his 
liberal democratic party had to persuade him not to resign over of 
allegations he kept paid mistresses 
stock prices plunged despite the denials 
according to the reports uno told party leaders the accusations 
insulted his dignity and made it difficult for him to meet other 
world leaders 
political situation appears increasingly fluid said a 
headline in the national newspaper asahi and the financial 
newspaper nihon keizai declared omen of confusion in politics 
uno said wednesday im not such an irresponsible person as to 
resign before making political reforms he promised on taking office 
june 2 he told legislators and businessmen at a trade meeting he 
would attend the summit of seven industrialized nations in paris 
next month 
he was foreign minister when he replaced noboru takeshita who 
resigned to take responsibility for the scandal involving recruit 
co an information and publishing conglomerate accused of trying to 
buy influence with bribes and cutprice stock 
reports about unos alleged woman problem have incresed in 
the past week 
mitsuko nakanishi a former geisha said on television sunday the 
prime minister who is married paid her to be his mistress in 1985 
the same allegation had appeared in a national magazine without 
naming ms nakanishi 
two weekly magazines said later that uno kept two other 
mistresses 
one reported that a former geisha known professionally as hatsuko 
said she was paid 100000 yen 700 a month for 10 years until 
1985 the other quoted his former secretary as saying that from 
1962 to 1972 uno paid an unknown sum to a ginza bar hostess 
identified only as ms y who became pregnant and had an abortion 
foreign exchange dealers attributed a sharp decline in the value 
of the yen wednesday to fears of political instability the dollar 
closed at 14355 yen up 232 yen from tuesdays close 
daiwa banks kenji ishizuka said most of a 067 percent drop in 
the main tokyo stock exchange index was due to politicians 
inability to resolve their problems 
after takeshita decided to resign because of the recruit scandal 
which led to the resignations of three cabinet ministers the party 
spent a month searching for a scandalfree successor uno was chosen 
after masayoshi ito a noted reformer refused the job 
in parliament earlier this week uno would not answer questions 
about the alleged affair with ms nakanishi calling it a private 
matter on wednesday he repeated his previous comment that ive 
never done anything contrary to morality 
womens groups have demanded that he explain his actions 
threatening to campaign against his party otherwise the liberal 
democratic party has governed japan since it was formed in 1955 
the liberal democrats were shaken sunday by a defeat in an upper 
house byelection at niigata in northeast japan which is 
traditionally conservative but elected a woman running for the 
socialist party 
elections for the tokyo municipal assembly are scheduled for the 
weekend and half the upper house of parliament is to be chosen next 
month 
on wednesday an asahi editorial on unos problems declared it 
is bizarre indeed that this man is being forced for personal 
reasons to virtually hide from the voting public right before 
important elections he is totally lacking in class

committed suicide 
souther 32 defected to the soviet union and rose to become a 
major in the soviet kgb yet his nervous system could not stand 
the pressure gen vladimir kryuchkov told reporters in moscow 
outside the meeting hall of the soviet legislature 
souther kryuchkov said took his life last week and left a note 
thanking the soviet government for what it did for him personally 
the spy chief would not say how souther committed suicide 
the obituary on tuesday identified souther by the russian name of 
mikhail orlov a name he took when he arrived in the soviet union 
kryuchkov said 
the name had led to speculation that souther ws a russian mole 
rather than an american defector 
kryuchkov said souther left behind a russian wife and daughter 
and was buried monday in the same cemetery as kim philby the 
british traitor who spied for moscow he said southers parents and 
brother traveled to moscow from the united states for the funeral 
some of the people who knew souther as a russian major at old 
dominion university speculated he committed suicide because of his 
disillusionment with the soviet union 
they used him like a spider playing with a moth and when they 
were going to finish with him they finished with him said 
barbara fahey a professors wife who knew him in school 
others said he could have turned soviet spy but they doubt he was 
a mole who masqueraded as an american during four years at old 
dominion and an eightyear navy enlisted career that included 
intelligence work 
he was not a soviet i can assure you of that said ms 
faheys husband john a retired navy commander who taught russian 
to souther at old dominion 
fahey said the soviets may have described souther as one of their 
own to prevent the united states from investigating his death 
despite glasnost disinformation is not dead in the soviet 
union he said 
the faheys remembered souther as a prankster who loved to be the 
center of attention 
he wanted to be the life of the party mrs fahey said i 
felt he was screaming out to be seen and heard 
southers outgoing personality may have been illsuited to the 
soviet union the faheys said 
im sure he was depressed after they got through with him and 
debriefed him he would not get the recognition or attention 
there fahey said the dismal life there im sure was a shock to 
him 
ronald kessler a writer preparing a book on souther said his 
research shows souther was an american who became a soviet spy 
he was in fact a very successful spy kessler said in a 
telephone interview from his potomac md home its possible 
that he took this russian name after he defected 
kessler said souther referred to my lifes vicissitudes in a 
letter he sent the writer this month he was perhaps having second 
thoughts or having trouble adjusting over there kessler said 
souther enlisted in the navy in 1975 and was honorably discharged 
in 1982 with the rank of petty officer first class he served in the 
naval reserve until may 1986 
thats when he disappeared he turned up on soviet television 
last july saying he had defected because he was being harassed by 
the fbi souther indicated in the broadcast that he was dissatisfied 
with his new life although he had a comfortable moscow apartment 
i havent found my niche exactly i dont feel that im being 
the most productive for what i have to offer he said 
souther had been married to an italian woman and had a son with 
her before they divorced said fran hassencahl his speech professor 
at old dominion ms hassencahl said he was engaged to an american 
woman when he defected 
kessler said he had been told souther was in excellent health and 
rode his bicycle regularly in the soviet union 
theres no reason to believe that he would die so early he 
said any kind of violent death should be considered 
dennis leighton who knew souther in the mid1970s when they 
attended high school in cumberland maine said he was surprised 
when he found out about the defection 
to me he was just a regular guy who ran track and 
crosscountry there was nothing unusual said leighton a 
physical therapist in portland maine if he was a russian he had 
me fooled he wasnt political or anything 
one of southers campus pranks may have led to his decision to 
defect fahey said because he was suspended from old dominion in 
1984 for biting a female student on the neck souther was turned 
down for navys officer candidate school 
he was very bitter about what happened to him as far as the 
problem on campus fahey said he really wanted to become a 
naval officer

democratic fundraisers said wednesday they are 
recruiting women to run for dozens of open and swing house seats 
expected to result from the 1992 overhaul of the nations 
congressional districts 
this is the critical moment said rosa delauro executive 
director of emilys list which has raised nearly 1 million for 
democratic women candidates in the last four years 
women who make up about 6 percent of the house have increased 
their numbers only three times in 20 years in 1972 and 1982 after 
redistricting and in 1988 emilys list an acronym for early money 
is like yeast attributes the 1988 increase largely to its own 
fundraising activities on behalf of several women who are now house 
freshmen 
the group estimates there will be 80 open seats as a result of 
redistricting retirement and electoral changes in 1992 recruiters 
are already trying to identify potential women candidates for 1992 
and 1994 as part of a longterm majority project 
asked how the list intends to make sure democratic women preempt 
the democratic men who no doubt will be interested in running for 
the same open seats delauro replied were going to find them 
fast 
and give them money added celinda lake a consultant 
studying womens house campaigns 
delauro said the majority project also is looking at which women 
incumbents may be vulnerable due to the 1992 redistricting process 
and will help them work closely with democrats in the state 
legislatures charged with drawing the new lines 
democratic incumbents with districts likely to change are reps 
louise slaughter and nita lowey of new york according to mark gersh 
of the national committee for an effective congress a political 
action committee working with emilys list 
gersh said the two districts in the suburbs of rochester and new 
york city dont have enough people and whatever changes are made 
could either solidify or weaken the two womens positions 
gersh also said rep jill long dind was elected in a 
republican district and any subtle boundary changes could affect her 
future he said the greater cleveland area stands to lose a seat 
affecting any one of six or seven incumbents one of them rep mary 
rose oakar is a democratic woman 
open seat opportunities are expected to abound in california 
texas and florida because of population shifts california 
anticipates a gain of five to seven seats during reapportionment 
while the other two should win at least three seats each 
many of the new seats will be in suburban areas a factor the 
strategists said bodes well for women according to lake women 
become increasingly attractive candidates as income level rises and 
the proportion of women under 45 working outside the home increases

from a deserted strip of highway to the musclebound 
athletes of a high school football team the many faces of the 
american south are on display at the international photography 
festival in the city of arles 
the deep south at the palais de larcheveche from july 2 
through sept 3 features 200 pictures by 18 american and european 
photographers some of the photos date back to 1930 
the south has long been photographys poor relative because 
its so difficult to photograph said gilles mora the shows 
curator there is racial tension and then there are the 
protectionist attitudes of the people who resent outside cultural 
influences 
american photographer robert franks pictures of birmingham 
ala focus on the citys downandout residents 
frank gave up photography 20 years ago to pursue a career in the 
movies but he picked up his camera again last year to photograph 
birminghams centennial celebrations at the request of the 
birmingham news 
also on show are works by bruce davidson best known for his 
pictures of the new york subway and east 100th street in harlem for 
the deep south he shot firefighters doctors and police 
mora a photographer who spent four years teaching french in 
louisiana says the french are particularly fond of the south 
its the only place in the united states where theres a life 
for the senses there are smells people live outdoors and take 
walks they handle problems with a kind of inefficient and relaxed 
detachment reminiscent of southern france italy and other latin 
countries mora said 
the south is a unique juxtaposition of kitsch and class luxury 
and poverty 
in the 1930s dozens of american photographers immortalized the 
works project administration the government sponsored building and 
improvement project that created jobs for the unemployed between 
193543 
the photos show that the south hasnt gone down hill things 
are remarkably unchanged mora said there are the same 
landscapes and cityscapes and the people show the same pride and 
the same mistrust of outsiders

morning star rested quietly on the capitol lawn 
wednesday fixing her yellow eyes on the crowd as politicians and 
conservationists advocated the return of her species the timber 
wolf to yellowstone national park 
wolves dont eat little children stressed rep wayne owens 
dutah sponsor of a bill requiring the national park service to do 
an environmental impact study on returning wolves to yellowstone 
wolves have gotten an undeserved bad reputation because they 
howl at night and scare people and compete with us for food 
said owens 
even as owens was discussing his measure sen alan k simpson 
rwyo was attacking it in a statement issued in cheyenne 
simpson an opponent of returning wolves to yellowstone 
condemned owens bill as a misguided and zealous effort to 
accelerate wolf reintroduction without considering in any way how 
wolves will affect other animals in yellowstone park and the very 
real human beings that also live in wyoming 
hes half right i am zealous owens responded in washington 
owens bill does not require the reintroduction of wolves to the 
park rather it directs the park service to begin a study of what 
the impact would be if wolves were returned and sets a date of dec 
31 1991 for completion of that report 
it has been 60 years since a wolfs howl has been heard in 
yellowstone m rupert cutler president of the conservation group 
defenders of wildlife said in washington it never should have 
been silenced 
morning star a 13monthold female gray wolf shifted her long 
legs and panted slightly in the capitals summer heat and humidity 
but otherwise seemed uninterested in the speeches and cameras 
she yawned languidly as owens expounded on her docility 
tolerating petting from him and her handlers from wolf haven a 
refuge near olympia wash that cares for abandoned wolves 
wolves were exterminated from yellowstone by hunters and 
government trappers cutler said with the result that today 
thousands of elk and bison are overgrazing the yellowstone range 
and many starve to death every winter 
wolves are needed in the northern rockies to restore the 
natural balance among animals said cutler 
although backed by defenders of wildlife the national wildlife 
federation the national parks and conservation association and 
other national and local conservation groups owens measure may 
face rough going due to opposition from ranchers who fear wolves 
will eat their sheep and cattle 
owens said he has invited simpson to travel to canada with him to 
see a park where wolves live peacefully not bothering nearby 
livestock 
and cutler pointed out that defenders of wildlife has raised a 
special fund to compensate any rancher in the yellowstone area 
losing stock to wolves 
rep william d ford dmich said he was cosponsoring the 
measure as a way of trying to make amends to nature for what our 
predecessors did 
asked how he would respond to residents who contend he is 
interfering in local affairs of the park region owens said that 
they dont own the park the park belongs to all americans 
while wolves once roamed over much of the area currently occupied 
by the united states they were relentlessly hunted and poisoned in 
the last century today only alaska has large numbers of wolves 
with about 1200 in northern minnesota and a few reported in 
michigan and montana

a clotbusting drug that interrupts heart attacks 
has been redesigned to work longer which might reduce the risk of a 
second heart attack after treatment 
in test tube experiments an altered version of a drug called 
tissue plasminogen activator remained largely potent when exposed to 
substances in blood that deactivate the current form of the drug 
the work is described in thursdays issue of the british journal 
nature by researchers at the university of texas southwestern 
medical center in dallas and the howard hughes medical institute 
there 
it will take animal studies to assess the persistence of altered 
forms of the drug said study coauthor joseph sambrook of the 
medical center on wednesday 
most heart attacks occur when a clot plugs an artery that feeds 
blood to part of the heart muscle tissue plasminogen activator 
called tpa can stop a heart attack by dissolving the clot 
but some patients who get tpa therapy develop another clot after 
the treatment stops putting them at risk for another heart attack 
if tpa can be made to remain active longer it may reduce the 
tendency toward forming clots after therapy stops said thomas j 
ryan chief of cardiology at boston university 
tpas effectiveness is limited not only by inactivation but also 
because the drug is removed from the bloodstream by the liver that 
is why animal studies are needed to assess persistence of altered 
versions said edgar haber president of the squibb institute for 
medical research in princeton nj 
some researchers have altered tpa to hamper removal by the liver 
and perhaps that approach can be combined with that of the new study 
to create a longerlasting drug haber said 
sambrook said a longerlasting tpa might make treatment cheaper 
because smaller doses could be used currently because a given dose 
works only briefly tpa must be given as a continuous infusion over 
a few hours he said 
the treatment costs about 2000 some 10 times that of using 
another clotbusting drug streptokinase which is administered as a 
single injection

president bush planned to send congress late 
today his proposal for a constitutional amendment to prohibit flag 
desecration his spokesman announced 
it was a matter he felt strongly about and which he wanted to 
present to the american people said white house press secretary 
marlin fitzwater 
bush on tuesday joined a chorus of lawmakers in calling for such 
an amendment to nullify last weeks supreme court ruling overturning 
state flagdesecration laws 
however house speaker thomas foley said the house will not rush 
to nullify the supreme court decision he contends the issue should 
not be used for crass political purposes 
moving to slow down a possible stampede for constitutional 
change foley announced tuesday that hearings will be held in july 
on setting aside the court ruling that threw out flag desecration 
laws in 48 states 
fitzwater said bush had consulted with attorneys on details of 
his proposed amendment and that a number of proposals already had 
been advanced on capitol hill its not like theres a clear plate 
here he said theres been a lot of drafting done on the hill 
fitzwater did not divulge specific details of bushs proposal 
the president has proclaimed that a constitutional amendment a 
process used only 26 times in the nations history is the only 
solution to change the 54 ruling 
foley dwash said the house judiciary committee hearings are 
not going to be rushed but they will not be obstructive they will 
be conducted calmly in the spirit of deliberation and care we 
are not seeking to inflame this issue he told reporters 
foley called a constitutional change a very deeply felt matter 
and also one which touches upon the first amendment to the 
united states constitution which is the source of the most sacred 
personal values of this country freedom of speech freedom of 
religious worship and freedom of the press 
a proposed 27th amendment might attempt to carve out a specific 
and narrow exception to the first amendments freespeech protection 
for flag burning but freespeech advocates said any such effort 
endangers all freedom of expression 
the minute you establish the principle that there can be 
exceptions to the first amendment for offensive speech theres no 
principled way to limit it ira glasser executive director of the 
american civil liberties union said today 
the first exception will not be the last glasser added 
someone adds an exception for derogatory racial remarks if youre 
a woman you want an exception for playboy if youre a jew you want 
an exception for nazis marching pretty soon you dont have a first 
amendment 
with senators already home for their july 4 break foley gave 
house members outraged by last weeks ruling a chance to vent their 
feelings he scheduled an immediate vote on a nonbinding resolution 
expressing profound concern over the decision and the house 
passed it 4115 
senate judiciary committee chairman joseph r biden jr ddel 
said tuesday he favors seeking to nullify the ruling by passing 
legislation to prohibit burning the flag a law can be ruled 
unconstitutional by the supreme court 
attorney general dick thornburgh interviewed today on cbs this 
morning noted that the courts still would have a role in 
interpreting the amendment 
if the constitutional amendment is passed it will obviously 
require some implementing legislation at both the federal and state 
level if the congress and state legislators want to follow through 
on it effectively and the terms of that legislation would then be 
subject to construction in the courts he said 
foley told reporters he will vigorously fight any attempt by 
conservative republicans to use the flag issue against democrats 
president bush scored points against democratic presidential 
candidate michael dukakis last year by criticizing the massachusetts 
governors veto of legislation that would have required the states 
public school teachers to lead daily pledges of allegiance to the 
flag 
i am sure there will be people trying to play politics with 
it foley said anybody who suggests that there is a party 
difference in respect for the american flag is using this deep 
affection of americans twisting it manipulating it using it for 
the most base and crass political purposes it would be 
reprehensible and disgusting i am condemning those who are doing 
it 
but bush said earlier tuesday at a news conference i think 
respect for the flag transcends political party and i think what 
ive said here is american it isnt republican or democrat it 
isnt liberal or conservative 
debate on the resolution sponsored by house judiciary committee 
chairman jack brooks dtexas was often emotional despite the 
nonbinding nature of the language 
rep carroll hubbard jr dky asked those who burn the flag to 
consider moving to iran china or cuba where burning the flag 
is encouraged 
but rep ted weiss dny said the court acted correctly to 
preserve freedom of speech adding i exult in the decision 
because the supreme court has validated once again the constitution 
and the bill of rights 
saying he personally deplored desecration of the flag weiss 
cautioned members against reckless tampering with the 
constitution 
voting along with weiss against the resolution were reps gus 
savage dill ronald dellums dcalif william clay dmo and 
george w crockett jr dmich 
the house hearings could be held by the full judiciary committee 
but brooks could assign them to the civil rights subcommittee headed 
by rep don edwards dcalif a strong supporter of the court 
decision 
edwards pledged tuesday he will not try by any trick to bury 
a proposed constitutional amendment but added that he hopes people 
will think about the risk they are taking for freedom of speech 
bush declaring the american flag a unique national symbol 
said tuesday as president i will uphold our precious right to 
dissent but burning the flag goes too far and i want to see that 
matter remedied 
a constitutional amendment is ratified after a twothirds vote by 
both houses of congress and approval by legislatures of 38 states

the house on wednesday overwhelmingly passed a 
bill aimed at freeing a woman jailed nearly two years by a judge for 
refusing to reveal the whereabouts of her daughter in a 
childcustody case 
the bill would require prosecutors in the district of columbia to 
release or to file criminal contempt charges guaranteeing a trial 
and the possibility of bail against anyone who had been held more 
than 12 months for civil contempt of court 
the measure which passed by a 37634 margin is designed to 
apply retroactively to the case of dr elizabeth morgan a local 
plastic surgeon 
she was jailed for civil contempt in august 1987 after refusing 
to produce her daughter hilary for courtordered visits with dr 
eric foretich her exhusband and the girls father 
morgan hid hilary after alleging that foretich had sexually 
abused the 6yearold girl foretich has repeatedly denied those 
charges 
before the legislation could take effect the senate would have 
to act as well sen orrin hatch rutah has introduced a similar 
bill but it has not yet been debated 
congress has review power over all district of columbia laws but 
rarely uses its right to intervene in the citys court system 
morgans case now stands before the citys appeals court which 
is reviewing dc superior court judge herbert dixons may 11 
decision to keep her behind bars until she reveals where her 
daughter is 
the case has gained national attention as womens rights groups 
and organizations concerned with child abuse have rallied to 
morgans defense foretich has been backed by several fathers 
groups 
the controversy involving morgan is not the issue were 
addressing were addressing a flaw in the criminal justice 
system the bills sponsor rep frank wolf rva said during 
floor debate the flaw is that anyone including dr morgan can 
remain behind bars indefinitely on civil contempt charges 
the bill survived despite protests that it would set a dangerous 
precedent in child custody battles and complaints that congress 
should not intrude on city court matters 
this interferes with an ongoing court case and that is bad 
public policy rep herbert bateman said during debate on the 
bill if this is such a good idea we should have done it for all 
50 states 
dont apply it just to dr morgans case apply it to others 
and see if it fits pleaded rep richard durbin dill i have 
no doubt that this case is based on conscience but tomorrows case 
may be malice 
stephen sachs morgans attorney has repeatedly asked dixon to 
file criminal contempt charges against morgan so that she can 
receive a jury trial sachs declined to comment on the measure 
wednesday 
elaine mittleman foretichs attorney said this is clearly a 
special bill that is being passed just to benefit dr morgan 
dr foretichs rights as a father are being absolutely violated 
only two states wisconsin and california have similar limits 
on civil contempt of court jailings

a us company and a japanese 
manufacturer sold hundreds of thousands of substandard nuts and 
bolts to the pentagon and the comanche peak nuclear plant the 
justice department charged today 
the indictment unsealed today names yamaguchiseisakusho co of 
shizuoka japan and aircom fasteners inc of arlington 
the nuts and bolts were used in a variety of items including 
tractortrailers and other military vehicles and nuclear plants but 
authorities today said they dont know for sure where all the 
fasteners ended up 
the fort worth startelegram reported today that the bolts which 
were of an inferior composition but labeled as if they were made of 
higherquality material have been blamed for at least two 
accidents in which no one was hurt 
its like if someone orders a cadillac and you slap a cadillac 
emblem on a chevrolet and sell it as a cadillac said jim slick 
agent in charge of the defense criminal investigative service in the 
fort worth office of the inspector generals office 
us attorney marvin collins said he expects six aircom employees 
to surrender today marcy forman customs supervisor in houston 
said the government will seek extradition of five employees of the 
japanese manufacturer 
a woman who answered the telephone at aircom said no one was in 
the office and weve got nothing to say before hanging up 
the defense department and tu electric owner of comanche peak 
ordered bolts with high tensile strength meaning they would break 
only under extreme conditions 
but federal officials contend yamaguchi seisakusho used lowgrade 
boron in its bolts instead of stronger steel alloys the 
startelegram reported the bolts tend to fail prematurely when put 
under stress 
slick said we had several products that did not work because 
of the substandard fasteners and that constituted a safety problem 
slick and brooks griffin an investigator with the nuclear 
regulatory commission said they dont know where all the bolts 
ended up and to what extent they were used 
griffin said some of the bolts were taken out of a system that 
removes heat from the reactor core at the nearly operational 
comanche peak in glen rose he would not speculate on what would 
have happened had the bolts never been discovered 
peterbilt motors co had to recall many of its trucks including 
several used by the government to haul nuclear minuteman missiles 
after learning in 1988 that aircom bolts used in the steering 
mechanism were failing causing drivers to lose control the 
startelegram said 
at least two mishaps occurred before the recall but no injuries 
were reported the newspaper said citing unidentified sources 
the investigation began 2 years ago when the pentagon was tipped 
by industry sources authorities said

a us navy intelligence analyst who spied for the 
soviet union was a sensitive and emotional man who broke under the 
pressure of his work and committed suicide the head of the kgb said 
today 
glenn michael souther 32 defected to the soviet union and rose 
to become a major in the soviet kgb yet his nervous system could 
not stand the pressure this was apparent even in his homeland 
where life as a spy was far from simple gen vladimir kryuchkov 
told reporters outside the meeting hall of the soviet legislature 
kryuchkov in a rare admission of soviet spying said souther 
took his life last week and left a note thanking the soviet 
government for what it did for him personally 
the motive was not political kryuchkov said he long ago 
started to show a nervous state of mind he was a gifted emotional 
caring sensitive person he was easily hurt 
the spy chief would not say how souther committed suicide 
he said the usborn souther began working for the kgb several 
years before he came to the soviet union 
when souther defected in may 1986 the fbi was investigating him 
on charges of spying he appeared on soviet television in july 1988 
when the soviets announced the defection and said the fbi was 
harassing him 
a soviet obituary which appeared tuesday in the military 
newspaper red star identified souther first by the russian name of 
mikhail orlov which he took when he arrived in the soviet union 
kryuchkov said 
the name had led to speculation that he was a russian mole rather 
than an american defector 
kryuchkov said souther was born in the united states and that his 
parents brother and sister had traveled to moscow for the funeral 
he said souther was buried monday in the military section of 
kuntsevo cemetary the resting place of the late british traitor kim 
philby 
the fbi said souther was born in hammond ind and went to high 
school in cumberland maine he served in the navy in the 1970s and 
then went to work as a civilian intelligence specialist in the 
navys 2nd fleet headquarters in norfolk va 
i am very sorry he died at the age of 32 kryuchkov said 
it was also a personal loss i met him several times 
souther is survived by a russian wife and 18monthold daughter 
his former speech teacher at old dominion university fran 
hassencahl said souther previouly had been married to an italian 
woman while in the united states and that they divorced she said he 
was engaged to an american woman when he defected

a pet cat attacked an 8yearold girl 
several times and drove her family from their home making all 
kinds of weird sounds until it finally was wrestled to the ground 
by two men and killed 
the body of 3yearold gypsy was sent to a state laboratory for 
rabies testing 
ive watched all kinds of movies and ive never seen anything 
like this mike johnson said of the cats last attack on his 
daughter amy the cat was ripping her apart all over 
gypsy attacked amy several times monday and finally drove the 
family from the house for several hours 
when the family returned home johnson persuaded amy to take a 
shower thinking that perhaps she had picked up the scent of other 
cats 
but when the girl entered her bedroom gypsy reappeared glared 
at johnson and then pounced on amy clawing a oneinch gash above 
her right eye that required four stitches 
i thought i was going to die amy said it felt like 150 
needles going through me 
johnson rescued his daughter by striking the cat with a mop 
handle then called police while amys mother dorothy took her to 
a hospital 
after patrolman gary berg arrived he and johnson found the cat 
under amys bed 
she came flying out making all kinds of weird sounds 
johnson said 
the cat bit and scratched but the men managed to wrestle her to 
the floor johnson said he finally was forced to strangle the animal 
i was tired and the cat was freaking out and both of us were 
getting sliced and diced johnson said if was afraid if i let 
her go she would kill me 
she had an evil look on her face 
mrs johnson said gypsy had been with the family since she was a 
kitten and was never mistreated or deprived of food johnson said 
the cat never had a rabies shot but was an indoor cat and therefore 
unlikely to catch the disease 
dr philip haines of the state department of human services 
laboratory in augusta acknowledged that the likelihood of an indoor 
cat contracting rabies was slim but said there could be many 
reasons why a cat would go berserk

a group of current and former police 
employees has filed a 30 million lawsuit against the city of 
concord because a video camera was secretly placed in the police 
station mens room 
the department installed a hidden video camera above a urinal in 
1986 hoping to identify the person who clogged it several times 
with toilet paper 
chief george straka has called the surveillance bad judgment 
and said no one ever viewed the tapes 
the overflow reportedly flooded a computer room and the chiefs 
office on the floor below the restroom which was open to the public 
but used primarily by police 
the lawsuit filed tuesday in us district court accuses straka 
and three commanders of invading the plaintiffs privacy it asks 
that the city pay 1 million each to 26 officers and three civilian 
employees who allegedly were watched by police cadets and filmed as 
they stood at urinals 
the lawsuit also accuses the chief and his top commanders of 
making death threats to one officer gary primavera the day after 
primavera filed a claim against the city in the case the suit asks 
that he be awarded an additional 1 million for the alleged threats 
the tribune in oakland reported in wednesdays editions that 
straka captains bob evans and wayne novinger have been ordered 
suspended without pay for at least three weeks as a result of the 
video camera incident 
the disciplinary action was discussed at a squad briefing the 
paper said

disciplinary action saying the results of the investigation are 
personnel matters and not subject to public disclosure concord is 
about 25 miles northeast of san francisco

nasa spending next year will create 237000 
privateindustry jobs and spur 23 billion in privateindustry 
sales according to a study commissioned by a group of former nasa 
employees 
the nasa alumni league said the study by management information 
services inc is the first comprehensive look at the statebystate 
industry and job effects of space agency purchasing 
california with its huge aerospace industry is the biggest 
benefactor expected to garner 67 billion in sales and 70332 
nongovernment jobs created directly or indirectly by nasarelated 
spending the study found thats nearly 30 percent of the us 
total in both categories 
but the study also indicates that states not usually tied to the 
space industry benefit new jersey for example can expect 506 
million in sales and 5411 jobs the report said 
the study was based on an estimate that the national aeronautics 
and space administration will spend 113 billion in fiscal 1990 
which begins oct 1 nasa has asked for a budget of more than 13 
billion but that probably will be cut by appropriations committees 
studying the request 
nasa procurement spending in 1990 will create 237000 private 
sector jobs 23 billion in private industry sales and 24 billion 
in corporate profits the study said 
spending on that level also will generate 74 billion in 
federal state and local tax revenues 
florida alabama maryland and texas all with major nasa 
facilities also lead in the sales and jobs category 
texas would have 21 billion in sales and 19528 nongovernment 
employees from the nasa spending while florida would have 13 
billion in sales and 14756 jobs according to the study 
maryland would have 994 million in sales and 11122 jobs while 
alabama would have 858 million in sales and 8582 jobs 
the report also computed the indirect impact of nasa procurement 
on various states 
michigan for example would receive 14 indirectly from 
procurementinduced funds for every dollar the state receives in 
nasa money 
other states with large benefit ratios were indiana 12 for 
every 1 in nasa funds illinois 98 to 1 missouri 83 to 1 and 
oregon 67 to 1 
the study provided these estimated sales and job figures 
alaska 35 million in sales 236 jobs arizona 229 million

the pilot and captain of a tanker that 
spilled more 310000 gallons of oil in the delaware river said today 
an anchor was dropped too soon causing the vessel to swing around 
and run aground on the shoals 
in rhode island a grand jury was convened today to investigate a 
420000gallon oil spill and the cleanup of 250000 gallons of 
crude in texas was nearly over 
the spills occcured within hours of each other over the weekend 
capt raul dibarrart testifying at a coast guard inquiry in 
philadelphia said the crew of the uruguayan tanker was lowering the 
anchor to the waters surface in preparation for dropping anchor 
farther up the delaware river shipping channel 
i heard the anchor fall and i heard over the walkietalkie my 
lieutenant say its running away the captain said speaking 
through an intepreter 
the captain and the tanker pilot robert anderson said the 
vessel swung around and ran aground in the shallows then ran 
aground again as two tugboats tried to bring it back into deep water 
and set it back on course 
it was then that a tugboat captain noticed oil coming from the 
tanker the pilot said 
paul l ives jr president of the pilots association for the bay 
and river delaware said before the hearing got under way that 
dropping the anchor from 749foot vessel is like stepping on the 
leash of a running dog 
meanwhile a coast guard spokesman said more people and boats 
were being pressed into service today to clean up the heavy 
industrial heating oil which was mostly congealed in huge blobs 
that could be picked up by hand 
temperatures in the mid90s tuesday made the oil run in spots 
complicating the cleanup and raising the threat to the shore and to 
wildlife but coast guard spokesman jim weakley said todays weather 
was cooler and the spill is winding down 
its winding down because were getting the stuff out of the 
water he said 
meanwhile new jersey officials said a wind shift was sending oil 
toward their side of the river crews were cleaning up the debris as 
it came ashore said tom gallagher spokesman for the states 
emergency response agency 
coast guard spokeswoman annette sebastian said 600 people and 33 
boats worked on the cleanup tuesday and more were expected today 
officials dramatically reduced their estimate of the amount of oil 
spilled from 800000 gallons to about 310000 an estimated 106240 
gallons had been recovered by tuesday night 
in rhode island the effort to fix blame for fridays tanker 
accident shifted to a state grand jury some of the crew and the 
captain iakovas georgudis have been summoned 
the state is investigating whether a harbor pilot was required to 
be on board the world prodigy when it ran aground spilling 420000 
gallons of heating oil at the mouth of narragansett bay 
in interviews with coast guard officials and the governor after 
the spill georgudis admitted he made a mistake in not taking on a 
pilot to take the vessel into the harbor 
the coast guard wants prosecutors to grant a helmsman immunity 
from prosecution to secure his testimony helmsman konstadinos a 
paraskevopulos accompanied by an attorney and speaking through an 
interpreter invoked his fifth amendment right against 
selfincrimination and refused to testify tuesday at the coast guard 
inquiry 
virtually all the spilled no 2 heating oil had dispersed and 
officials said a rainstorm forecast for this afternoon would help 
flush the oil out of the sand and break up a sheen in the water 
in houston the pilot of a tanker that collided with a barge in 
the houston ship channel radioed he couldnt stop his vessel minutes 
before the accident according to the captain of a tugboat pushing 
the barge 
mason t ware testified at a coast guard inquiry that he realized 
he wouldnt be able to stop his tugboat and three barges it was 
pushing 
friday nights collision damaged one of the barges which leaked 
about 250000 gallons of crude into the water and fouled a milelong 
stretch of the galveston bay shoreline 
crews this morning continued the cleanup near la porte where 
most of the slick was contained within a ship channel and all but 
about 20000 gallons have been removed coast guard spokesman bob 
morehead said 
the tanker pilot michael gale testified tuesday that his vessel 
failed to perform as expected on a right turn into the channel 
leading to the collision 
in delaware the state filed suit in federal court against the 
government of uruguay and the captain of the presidente rivera 
seeking unspecified damages caused when the governmentowned tanker 
ran aground saturday 
the spill covered 21 miles tuesday extending from above marcus 
hook pa to below pea patch island the island is the site of a 
wildlife refuge which was being protected by booms

the government reported wednesday that its 
chief economic forecasting gauge plunged last month taking the 
deepest dip since the 1987 stock market crash but many analysts 
remained confident the economy is not being steered into a recession 
the 12 percent decline in the index of leading economic 
indicators was the steepest since a 18 percent dropoff in november 
l987 the commerce department reported the drop in 1987 reflected 
the shock from the 508point plunge in the dow jones index of 30 
industrial stocks on oct 19 1987 
many analysts were expecting a decline although perhaps not as 
steep and said it was consistent with the socalled soft landing 
sought by the federal reserve as it seeks to stem inflation by 
slowing the economy without driving it into recession 
the index is designed to foretell economic activity six to nine 
months into the future 
at the white house spokesman marlin fitzwater said of the drop 
the economy is healthy and growing at a slower pace which means 
less pressure on inflation and interest rates we still think that 
the economy is in very good shape 
undersecretary of commerce michael r darby told reporters i 
think the federal reserve has been aiming at more moderate growth 
and it has been successful in achieving that this spring 
other economists agreed 
although the numbers came in a bit lower than expected i still 
think the fed is on track for a soft landing said david wyss 
senior financial economist of data resources inc in lexington 
mass 
however analysts such as wyss and lawrence chimerine senior 
economic adviser for the wefa group in bala cynwyd pa also 
expressed concern that the fed not overtighten its grip on the 
economy 
while again i think well avoid a recession certainly well 
have to watch the next couple of months very carefully chimerine 
said 
there have been signs recently that the fed has been easing 
interest rates and some economists anticipate further easing as the 
economy continues to slow 
i dont expect a discount rate cut wyss said but i do 
expect to see interest rates moving down further due to other fed 
action the slower economic growth is getting impressive enough that 
they will want to loosen again 
the may decline was the third in four months the index fell 03 
percent in february and 06 percent in march but rose 06 percent in 
april thus allowing the index to steer clear of the traditional 
signal of a forthcoming recession three consecutive monthly 
declines 
while a threemonth drop has preceded all eight recessions since 
1948 there also have been five similar series of declines 
including the five consecutive months surrounding the 1987 stock 
market crash that were not followed by recessions 
only two of the forwardlooking business statistics that make up 
the composite index moved up in may higher stock prices and 
increased building permits 
the others moved down a drop in the money supply lower prices 
for sensitive materials indicating slower demand the fourth 
consecutive drop in an index measuring consumer confidence faster 
vendor deliveries meaning declining demand a shorter average work 
week fewer orders for plants and equipment a decrease in 
manufacturers unfilled orders higher initial claims for jobless 
benefits and a decrease in manufacturers new orders 
the various changes left the index at 1438 percent of its 1982 
base of 100 so far this year the index has declined at an annual 
rate of 2 percent compared with an increase of 45 percent for all 
of 1988

a state appeals court today refused to disturb 
a judges order temporarily preventing the commissioner of baseball 
from holding a disciplinary hearing on charges pete rose bet on his 
own teams games 
the ruling was the second court loss in four days for 
commissioner a bartlett giamatti 
on sunday common pleas judge norbert a nadel granted rose a 
14day temporary restraining order blocking the hearing nadel said 
that giamatti had already made up his mind against rose and could 
not give him a fair hearing 
baseballs lawyers asked an ohio appeals court to nullify the 
order arguing it interferes with the commissioners powers to 
protect the integrity of the game 
but a threejudge appellate panel this afternoon said it has no 
authority to review a temporary restraining order 
baseballs lawyers could not be immediately reached for comment 
on whether they would pursue their appeal to the ohio supreme court 
rose is accused of gambling on his own team an offense that 
could get him banned from the game for life 
the allegations against the cincinnati reds manager are in a 
225page report by chief baseball investigator john m dowd and 
eight accompanying volumes of evidence 
among other things the report contains statements by a former 
rose associate that rose conferred with other baseball managers 
before deciding whether to bet on their teams and tried to get 
involved in cocaine deals 
the drug accusations against rose were made in february by paul 
janszen a bodybuilder who recently completed a fourmonth stay in a 
halfway house for failing to report income from the sale of steroids 
on his taxes he said rose tried to get involved in the cocaine 
deals of his other associates 
it was the first time rose has been publicly linked to drugs by 
testimony in the investigation which was announced march 20 the 
report was released monday 
janszen didnt say rose used drugs but said the manager thought 
he could get cash from drug deals conducted by a circle of 
associates rose sometimes had trouble paying his large gambling 
debts according to janszen 
several of the associates were sentenced after federal 
authorities cracked a ring that transported cocaine from florida to 
ohio 
janszen said he traveled with rose on road trips in april may 
and june 1987 and spent a lot of time in the reds clubhouse he 
said he saw rose research games before he bet on them 
when i was with him all day long janszen said he could 
sit in the clubhouse and depending on what city it was he didnt 
like to do it in new york because he said new yorks phones were 
being tapped and he was under investigation up there for gambling 
but there is different cities that he knew the phones were 
safe and he would call up different managers and ask them how 
certain pitchers arms were and if they were going to play certain 
players that night and try to get as much information as he could 
about a game so then he could go ahead and either bet the game or 
not bet the game 
janszen said he wouldnt swear to this but he thought rose 
called detroit manager sparky anderson once for information on 
pitcher jack morris physical condition anderson managed rose 
during cincinnatis big red machine era of the 1970s 
anderson declined to comment tuesday in detroit about anything 
related to the rose investigation 
other managers scoffed at the accusation that rose made telephone 
calls to get information for bets 
i think its absurd minnesotas tom kelly said i wouldnt 
dignify that with a comment 
roses attempts to get tips werent limited to managers janszen 
said adding that in spring 1987 rose placed bets on college 
basketball 
what he would do is he would get down to the spring training 
facility then in tampa fla and talk to some of the other guys 
and figure out who they liked maybe run into a sportswriter you 
know who do you like tonight then he would call and you see 
thats how it worked janszen said he kept losing 
later in the year janszen said he placed bets for rose on reds 
games and other baseball games he said rose didnt bet against the 
reds 
janszen said rose got heavily into debt with a new york bookie 
and when they had to go to new york and play a baseball game 
he was scared to death to go up there because he was afraid they 
would come into the clubhouse janszen said but they never 
did 
janszen said rose wasnt always careful to hide his gambling 
he would talk about his gambling in front of a lot of people 
janszen said 
he put himself above everything they cant get me what have 
they got what are they going to prove how are they going to prove 
it 
rose may have bigger problems than baseball for dowds report 
also says he conspired to hide his racetrack winnings from a 47646 
piksix ticket in 1987 
if the charges are true rose faces possible charges of 
conspiracy to defraud the us government a federal grand jury is 
investigating roses income taxes

freespeech advocates reacting strongly to a 
proposal by president bush said wednesday a constitutional 
amendment to protect the american flag inevitably would lead to 
censorship of many unpopular views 
the minute you establish the principle that there can be 
exceptions to the first amendment for offensive speech theres no 
principled way to limit it said ira glasser executive director 
of the american civil liberties union 
the first exception will not be the last he said someone 
adds an exception for derogatory racial remarks if youre a woman 
you want an exception for playboy if youre a jew you want an 
exception for nazis marching pretty soon you dont have a first 
amendment 
the presidents call for an amendment on tuesday was sparked by 
the supreme courts ruling last week that burning the flag is a 
constitutionally protected form of political protest 
bush didnt say just how his proposed amendment would read but 
he did call the flag a unique symbol of america suggesting he 
believes the constitution can be amended to outlaw flag burning 
without unduly threatening the right to protest 
his spokesman marlin fitzwater underlined that idea wednesday 
saying the president does not believe this amendment would cause 
an unraveling of the constitution 
burton yale pines of the heritage foundation supported bush 
saying this is no frivolous exercise no slippery slope down 
which a host of democratic guarantees may slide the amending 
process would permit a national debate and referendum on the flag 
but the aclus glasser disagrees 
i think its impossible to draft limiting language he said 
would it say flag burning or flag desecration would desecration 
include wearing the flag or superimposing a dove on it or failing 
to salute it 
flag amendments already pending in congress generally would give 
the federal government and the states authority to prohibit 
desecration of the flag and to impose criminal penalties for such 
actions 
one introduced by sen strom thurmond ranking republican on the 
senate judiciary committee does not mention criminal penalties but 
says 
the congress of the united states and the states have the power 
to prohibit the desecrating mutilating defacing defiling or 
burning of the flag of the united states 
attorney general dick thornburgh said the courts still would have 
a role in interpreting any amendment 
if the constitutional amendment is passed it will obviously 
require some implementing legislation at both the federal and state 
level if the congress and state legislators want to follow through 
on it effectively and the terms of that legislation would then be 
subject to construction in the courts thornburgh said 
amending the constitution is no easy matter an amendment 
beginning in congress must be approved by twothirds of the house 
and senate and by 38 state legislatures 
floyd abrams a lawyer who has represented the news media in 
numerous freespeech cases said never before in our history have 
we limited what the supreme court has held to be the first amendment 
rights of americans 
he said president bushs call for a constitutional amendment 
represents a dangerous precedent adding i believe a good 
part of the impetus for it is demagogic in nature 
the constitutional right to burn the american flag as seen by 
the court is not absolute it does not protect those who burn 
someone elses flag or those who while burning a flag trespass 
disturb the peace or create a safety hazard 
abrams said the constitution was drafted for the ages theres 
no way a flagdesecration amendment could be drafted for the ages

the government and the biggest group of 
tamil rebels agreed to an immediate ceasefire in a sixyear war 
that has claimed 9000 lives the two sides said wednesday 
on sri lankas second war front wednesday police said sinhalese 
extremists detonated a car bomb in the southern provincial capital 
killing four people and wounding 25 others 
industries minister ranil wickremasinghe announced the government 
and liberation tigers of tamil eelam reached agreement tuesday 
the two sides will resolve tamil demands for an independent 
nation and other differences through negotiations wickremasinghe 
said at a news conference 
it was not attended by any tamil leader but a rebel source said 
the ceasefire does not mean they have abandoned their campaign for 
a separate homeland in the northeast 
the ltte has clearly told the government that it is premature 
to talk about the withdrawal of the homeland demand the source 
said on condition of anonymity 
the truce follows a unilateral ceasefire announced by the tigers 
on may 4 when they began their first peace talks with the government 
rebels want a separate nation for the ethnic minority tamils 
because they say they are discriminated against by the sinhalese who 
comprise 75 percent of the population tamils are mainly hindu while 
most sinhalese are buddhist 
most war victims have been government soldiers and sinhalese 
civilians killed by rebels in the north and east where tamils 
predominate 
confrontations between the rebels and government troops reduced 
considerably after india brokered a july 29 1987 peace accord 
it confined the sri lankan military in the north and east to 
barracks and replaced them with indian peacekeeping troops 
the accord says rebels should surrender their arms in exchange 
for local political powers for the tamils who make up 18 percent of 
sri lankas 16 million people 
the tigers initially accepted the accord as did other smaller 
tamil rebel groups but then the tigers turned their guns on indian 
soldiers at least 800 indian troops and 1500 tamils have been 
killed 
president ranasinghe premadasa has asked india to withdraw its 
45000 troops by the second anniversary of the accord but new delhi 
says a hasty withdrawal could cause even greater violence 
india got involved because its own 60 million tamils sympathize 
with the sri lankan rebels cause 
wednesdays ceasefire offers peace for the north and east but 
the government still is fighting a southern insurgency against 
ultranationalist sinhalese angered by the indian troop presence and 
government concessions to tamils 
extremists of the leftwing sinhalese peoples liberation front 
have killed more than 3500 government officials supporters and 
governing party members in the last two years by official count 
front guerrillas wednesday detonated a car bomb outside a local 
government building in galle were 50 councilors were meeting a 
senior police official said in a telephone interview 
it killed four people the officer said without identifying the 
victims 
galle 70 miles south of colombo is headquarters of the southern 
province

when a magazine interviewed mayor 
richard schoeninger for an article on what noted arkansans do under 
the sun his answer was au naturel he posed nude at his favorite 
swimming hole 
im a little bit mischievous and it was lots of fun 
schoeninger said wednesday 
a strategically placed boulder protected his modesty in the 
photograph which appears in the july issue of arkansas times 
magazine nevertheless the admittedly eccentric mayor was chastised 
at a council meeting tuesday by alderman susie bell 
it comes to a point in which ones uniqueness can interfere 
with the job we are trying to do she said

in the early 1940s jazz clubs in new york such 
as mintons were the scenes of some extraordinary jam sessions 
these musical gymnastics shaped the american art form to a classic 
style that became known as bebop 
trumpeter dizzy gillespie was one of the masterminds of bop and 
so it was fitting that he should lead a bebop revisited concert 
tuesday night at the jvc jazz festival 
bebop prospered under gillespie and kenny clarke who led the 
house band at mintons soon pianistcomposer thelonious monk and 
alto saxophonist charlie parker who also composed refined the 
musical style to pretty much what it is today 
some of parkers old bandmates played at the tuesday night 
concert at avery fisher hall including pianist duke jordan with 
parker in 194748 and trumpet player red rodney one of the first 
white musicians to understand bebop who played with the charlie 
parker quintet from 194951 
jordan and rodney joined phil woods on sax and mel lewis on drums 
in the evenings first set which featured outstanding solo work on 
some bebop standards jordans fingering was light and lovely on 
dont blame me woods sweetly soared with lover man and 
rodney was in good form with i cant get started 
gillespie joined in for a final blast with the group 
the next set brought the dueling pianos of barry harris and 
walter davis jr joining them were ron carter on bass and roy 
haynes who played with the parker quintet in 194950 on drums it 
was an energetic set that ended with an explosive version of how 
high the moon 
the second half of the evening opened with vibes king milt 
jackson who has worked with gillespie monk parker and the 
legendary modern jazz quartet jackson was joined by bob cranshaw on 
bass cedar walton on piano mickey roker on drums and jimmy heath 
on tenor sax gillespie joined in for a jam or two 
the group excelled with monks lilting round midnight 
unfortunately bad miking made art blakey and the jazz messengers 
a poor closing act avery fisher has excellent acoustics but some 
groups tend to overmike blakeys drums were so loud no other 
instrument in his eightpiece group could be heard and that 
included a trombone three saxophones and a trumpet 
by the time the group finished the set with a night in 
tunisia the amplification had been adjusted and listeners 
realized the collection of talent blakey had assembled 
blakeys jazz messengers has been a proving ground for some of 
the brightest talent in jazz the personnel whove played in the 
group reads like a whos who horace silver wynton marsalis 
branford marsalis wayne shorter lee morgan freddie hubbard woody 
shaw chick corea jackie mclean and cedar walton 
ed bradley of cbs 60 minutes served as host for the night 
before becoming a tv journalist bradley was a jazz deejay in 
philadelphia the concert was a benefit for the studio museum in 
harlem 
the jvc jazz festival is sponsored by the japanese victor corp

a principal has offered to sacrifice his 
own job so that teachers wont have to be fired from their 
financially pressed elementary school of 200 students 
principal norman najimy told the richmond school committee on 
tuesday it could help balance the books with the least damage to 
the children by firing him and applying his pay of 43000 a year 
toward teachers salaries he said the committee could pay a teacher 
an extra 3000 to run the school 
this kind of catastrophic financial situation forces a man to 
creatively destroy his school system george st pierre regional 
superintendent for richmond and several other small districts said 
wednesday thats what norm is doing 
najimy who was not in his office wednesday also submitted a 
list of 22 other possible moves ranging from cutbacks in phsyical 
education programs to boosting the price of school lunches in order 
to trim 150000 from the schools proposed 12 million budget for 
the upcoming fiscal year 
he argued against laying off any teachers 
building faculty is the hardest thing to do najimy told the 
committee if we lose our teachers we will never get them back 
st pierre said the school has the equivalent of 14 fulltime 
teachers including some parttime instructors teaching subjects 
such as art and music 
hes a very sincere person and i sincerely believe that norm 
wants to do what he thinks is best for the kids st pierre said 
its a small school in a small town with limited financial 
resources and the severe financial problems are due to things we 
have no control over st pierre said 
the school committee is scheduled to consider the cuts at its 
july 13 meeting richmond is a town of 1600 in the berkshire hills 
in western massachusetts

chinese media are giving prominent coverage to 
accounts that oppose the official line on the june 34 crackdown 
but they also denounce the contrary reports 
the government says the crackdown by thousands of troops marching 
on beijing was necessary to crush a small group seeking to overthrow 
the leadership 
the most recent example of reporting antigovernment views and 
then dismissing them came wednesday in the newspaper economic 
reference which told of a shanghai man who said the bloodstains on 
his shirt came from tiananmen square where he said 26000 people 
were killed 
geng xiuliang told people on a street corner in shanghai on june 
5 that he saw a 3yearold boy shot six times when soldiers backed 
by tanks drove student protesters and their supporters from the 
square 
geng a 36yearold worker at a metal factory tried to sell the 
shirt as a historic object for the equivalent of about 1350 
the newspaper said 
police stopped geng who admitted he was not at tiananmen on june 
34 but with a friend in shanghai where they killed a dog and ate 
it for supper the newspaper said 
it quoted geng as saying the bloodstains actually came from the 
dog the paper did not say whether geng was punished 
in another case the magazine beijing review this week gave 
astonishingly prominent play to antigovernment posters put up at 
chinese universities early on in the seven weeks of studentled 
demonstrations 
is there any reason for the existence of socialism asked 
one another declared right from the beginning everything the 
communist party has done is corrupt autocratic and traitorous the 
communist party has nothing good the magazine published excerpts 
from posters that described the party as just another group of 
autocrats in power in chinas thousandyearold feudal despotism 
and said it was rampant with profiteering officials full of 
corruption and degeneration and collapsing morality 
but the point of reproducing the posters the beijing review 
said was to show how a few people stir up turmoil by making use 
of all the wellmeaning aspirations of the broad masses of students 
by making use of the same peoples confused thinking by making use 
of some failings in the work of the party and government 
one of the bestknown instances of authorities publicizing 
antigovernment views is the case involving video footage 
intercepted from the abc news 
shown across china the tape shows a man animatedly describing 
how 20000 people were shot and crushed to death in the armys 
attack on tiananmen square 
news announcers urged the public to report the rumormonger to 
police and within 24 hours the man had been spotted and turned in 
to authorities in dalian a coastal city east of beijing 
the government says fewer than 300 people half of them soldiers 
were killed when the army marched on beijing chinese witnesses and 
western intelligence reports say up to 3000 people most civilians 
died 
statecontrolled media have singled out the voice of america for 
allegedly spreading rumors and interfering in chinas politics by 
broadcasting reports beijing considers inflammatory 
the chinese media have noted the voa quoted taiwan news reports 
that senior leader deng xiaoping had died or was seriously ill and 
that civil war was imminent in the days after the crackdown began 
many news organizations reported that apparent infighting within 
the military indicated civil war was possible but chinese criticism 
was directed at the voa 
if the voa reports arent rumormongering then what is a 
radio beijing news announcer said

the canadian museum of civilization opens thursday 
on the banks of the ottawa river giving canada an extravagant 
combination of hightech and culture aimed at luring more visitors 
to the national capital 
the government invested 214 million in the museum which forms 
an impressive triangle of national landmarks parliament hill is 
visible from the glassedin grand hall of the museum on the ontario 
side of the river is the national gallery of art 
the 24acre museum has two separate structures a glacier wing 
for exhibition space and a canadian shield wing for storage and 
administration 
architect douglas cardinal said one of his goals was to make the 
vividly curved building appear as if it were carved by the glaciers 
and all the forces of nature 
for years a debate has gone on in canada over what constitutes 
the countrys national identity and whether anything more complex 
than a royal canadian mounted police officer can legitimately be 
called a national symbol 
as such virtually every aspect of the museum can figure in the 
quest for a national identity 
the museum houses a major collection of pacific coast indian 
totem poles native art and artifacts and wiring for its hightech 
systems that could circle the globe 18 times 
museum director george macdonald likes to speak of the museum as 
being of the global village the term the late canadian media 
analyst marshall mcluhan used to describe the world as a single 
community formed as a result of mass media rapid travel and other 
developments 
the museums technological systems have been described as 
symbolic of the importance of communications in developing a vast 
but sparsely populated country of 26 million people 
the museum will be able to tie into communications systems 
elsewhere and use the technology for research and educational 
purposes as well as its own exhibitions 
there have been complaints the cost was excessive at a time of 
budgetary restraints and that the new museum is as much a theme park 
as a cultural center 
macdonald said the cost said to be more than triple the original 
budget actually was within 30 percent of the target 
perhaps most like a theme park is the history hall where 
visitors can pass through exhibits showing the settlement of canada 
from whaling in the 16th century to mining in the west 
costumed actors will roam through the sections with buildings 
and other props to dramatize past and present ways of life 
only 45 percent of the exhibitions planned for the more than 1 
million square feet of space were ready for opening day 
the rest will open gradually in the next few years

christian and moslem leaders wednesday 
supported an arab league call for a ceasefire but syrian and 
lebanese christian gunners continued to trade shellfire that killed 
two people 
police said 11 people were wounded by the rocket and artillery 
shells that exploded on both sides of the green line slicing beirut 
into christian and moslem sectors 
by police count 375 people have been killed and 1471 wounded 
since march 8 when the duel began between gen michel aouns mainly 
christian lebanese army and syrian soldiers allied with lebanese 
druse militiamen 
the arab leagues special committee on lebanon called for both 
sides to lift port blockades that started the fighting 
the committee grouping algerian president chadli bendjedid king 
hassan ii of morocco and saudi arabias king fahd issued its latest 
appeal after a tuesday meeting in oran algeria beirut radio 
stations aired the call several times as fighting raged wednesday 
an arab summit gave the committee six months to negotiate a 
settlement to lebanons 14year civil war but it has not been able 
to enforce even a truce 
we stress that for the initiation of dialogue resulting in 
benefits for the lebanese and lebanon violence in all its forms 
must stop said the three leaders statement 
the daily assafir which supports syria said lakhdar ibrahimi 
arab league assistant secretarygeneral will come to lebanon within 
48 hours in a new drive to stop the fighting 
committee leaders said their foreign ministers will hold talks 
with world leaders to promote peace syria is the chief power broker 
in lebanon while aoun is armed by iraq damascus chief arab foe 
following the contacts and a consolidated ceasefire the 
committee said it will invite lebanons singlechamber parliament to 
a foreign country of legislators choice to work out a new 
powersharing formula christian sects traditionally have dominated 
lebanese politics though they are outnumbered 21 by sunni and 
shiite moslems and the minority druse 
the ceasefire lifting of blockades and opening of crossing 
links must be achieved before the meeting of the parliamentarians 
outside lebanon which will set the stage for the meeting of the 
lebanese parliament in lebanon the committee said 
christian legislators welcomed the calls for a ceasefire and 
lifting of blockades but voiced reservations about meeting in a 
foreign country 
phalangist party leader george saadeh head of a rightwing 
christian coalition said if crossing gateways were reopened the 
lebanese would be able to meet in lebanon gates linking beiruts 
christian enclave to syrianpoliced moslem sectors have been blocked 
for more than three months 
syrias 40000 troops and allied forces started besieging the 
christian area northeast of beirut on march 14 six days after aoun 
blockaded illegal ports run by syrianbacked militias 
the conservative daily newspaper addiyar which is close to 
aoun said the maronite catholic leader opposes a parliament session 
outside lebanon because it contradicts the principles of 
sovereignty and national dignity 
lebanons parliament has not met for more than a year since it 
failed to elect a leader to succeed president amin gemayel when his 
term expired

about 1 million serbs gathered 
wednesday in kosovo an ancient serbian heartland now dominated by 
ethnic albanians to mark the 600th anniversary of a great battle 
and cheer their nationalist leader 
chants of slobo slobo arose when slobodan milosevic 
president of the serbian republic ascended a platform high above 
the flagwaving sea of admirers 
serbs came from all parts of yugoslavia and from abroad to bask 
in the nationalism milosevic has revived through his campaign to 
regain control over kosovo an autonomous province within serbia 
kosovo is serbia they chanted 
kosovo was the heart of medieval serbia where the serbs were 
defeated by the ottoman turks in the battle of kosovo in 1389 the 
defeat entered legend as the beginning of a fivecentury struggle by 
the serbs to keep their orthodox christian faith alive under moslem 
rule 
milosevic told the crowed wednesday it was very difficult to 
say today whether the battle of kosovo was a serbian defeat or 
victory whether we lost our freedom and became slaves or we 
managed to survive in spite of slavery 
six centuries ago serbia defended itself bravely in the field 
of kosovo but serbia was also defending europe he said it was 
a bulwark defending the european culture civilization and 
religion 
today serbs are a small minority in kosovo and claim they are 
harassed by the predominantly moslem ethnic albanians who make up 85 
percent of the 19 million people the impoverished southern 
province adjoins albania 
ethnic tension turned violent in march with fights between 
police and albanians protesting moves by serbia to take control of 
the provincial police judiciary and schools 
at least 25 people were killed and hundreds of ethnic albanians 
have been jailed 
on wednesday ethnic albanians stayed out of sight during the 
largest outpouring of serbian nationalism in more than four decades 
of communist rule the day began with religious ceremonies at one of 
serbias holiest shrines the 14th century byzantinestyle monastery 
of gracanica near pristina the provincial capital 
huge crowds of people many in serbian national costume streamed 
under a scorching sun to nearby gazimestan a hilly part of the 
battlefield crowned by a stone monument honoring those who died 
fighting the turks in 1389 
thousands of buses and private cars decorated with serbian flags 
portraits of milosevic and religious symbols jammed roads for miles 
an enthusiastic cheer greeted about 100 american serbs who waved 
both the stars and stripes and the serbian banner a serbian choir 
in full national dress from toronto sang traditional songs and 
danced 
some emigres who fled communist yugoslavia decades ago said only 
such an occasion could bring them back 
my father always told me we serbs are the live fire from 
kosovo said steve klipa 56 of pittsburgh he kissed the ground 
and crossed himself 
the serbian orthodox church was prominent in the days 
ceremonies several hours of which were broadcast on serbian tv the 
church once was repressed by the ruling communist party but is 
reviving in the nationalist fervor inspired by milosevic 
patriarch german 90yearold head of the church was seated in 
the front row of honored guests at gazimestan dozens of bearded 
priests in flowing black robes mingled with communist party 
dignitaries 
this is fantastic i never imagined anything like this would 
happen said ljiljana markovic a middleaged woman who stood atop 
the hill gazing at the crowd below 
organizers estimated the crowd at 15 million western reporters 
put it at slightly under 1 million 
police helicopters clattered overhead watching over the crowd 
and ferrying in milosevic and other other communist party officials 
from serbia and other regions 
serbias exiled royal family also has been welcomed in the flush 
of nationalism 
princess elisabeth daughter of prince paul karadjordjevic 
princeregent from 1934 until the outbreak of war in 1941 attended 
ceremonies in belgrade on sunday and was said to be in the crowd 
wednesday

an imprisoned american news 
photographer was allowed his first visit from a us diplomat 
wednesday since his arrest three weeks ago with moslem guerrillas 
fighting the communist government 
tony obrien of santa fe nm was visited in the office of the 
state interrogation department by renny smith a consular officer 
from the us embassy in new delhi 
he is eating ok and not complaining about his food and looked 
relaxed she said he is pretty happy i gave him cheese 
chocolates six books and paper and pencils 
obrien a freelance photographer working for timelife was 
captured by the afghan secret service june 8 at a guerrilla hideout 
in kabul 
ms smith came from new delhi because the us embassy in kabul 
closed in january a few weeks before soviet military forces 
withdrew feb 15 ending nine years of involvement in the civil war 
obrien 43 was sharing a 10footby8foot cell with two 
afghans she said asked when he might be released she replied i 
have learned not to speculate it can be the best or the worst best 
can be tomorrow worst can be 10 years of sentence and release by 
a presidential pardon 
afghan government officials said obrien would have to wait for a 
court verdict even if president najib decided to pardon him 
it is difficult to put a sense of timing one said privately 
it can be one month three months or even six months 
obrien felt isolated in the early stages but now he is aware 
what is being done what his friends are doing she said 
many embassies in kabul closed before the soviets left because 
of a widespread belief that the afghan army could not be able to 
guarantee the security of the capital 
moslem guerrillas began fighting after a communist coup in april 
1978 and soviet military forces entered the country in december 
1979 an estimated 115000 red army soldiers were in afghanistan 
when the withdrawal began last year

wuer kaixi the student leader who was smuggled 
out of china called for the overthrow of the wild beasts of 
communism and he predicted the current government would fall 
in a defiant videotaped message made after he fled the 
raspyvoiced leader of a movement for freedom choked back tears as 
he accused authorities of crushing students with tanks and burning 
bodies on tiananmen square 
those of us who remain alive our lives are no longer our 
own he said on the tape the lives of those classmates and 
countrymen who died for democracy for freedom and for our beautiful 
motherland have melted into ours we must focus our will and 
continue the great patriotic democratic movement to the end 
a hong kong activist showed the tape to the associated press on 
wednesday then distributed it to other news organizations 
wearing a tshirt from his school beijing normal university the 
21yearold freshman who has gone into hiding looked pale and drawn 
during the 18minute tape which was shot about a week ago he 
coughed weakly several times 
wuer was hospitalized more than 10 times after he began leading 
a hunger strike in may as the movement progressed and pressure 
intensified he began vomiting blood 
wuer savagely attacked chinas top leaders deng xiaoping 
premier li peng and president yang shangkun calling them a band 
of fascist reactionary warlords 
and the goverment they run he said was just a small stumbling 
block on the road of history 
this kind of government doesnt have the strength to continue 
living wuer said they are the peoples enemies 
he predicted it would last from six months to three years 
wuer and his girlfriend liu yan were smuggled out of china by 
a hong kongbased underground railroad despite a nationwide 
manhunt during which his photo was posted in airports and train 
stations more than a dozen others including two leading 
intellectuals and another student leader also have made it to 
safety in this manner 
a hong kong activist has declined to give details of the escape 
because he said it would jeopardize others trying to flee the bloody 
crackdown on dissent 
wuer was by far the bestknown and charismatic of the 21 student 
leaders accused of counterrevolutionary crimes by the communist 
leadership 
he was also the most widely criticized as the crackdown began 
staterun media showed a 10minute video of the leader eating with 
friends from hong kong accusing him of feasting when his 
classmates were fasting when the secret tape was made the hunger 
strike already had ended 
if this is feasting wuer said in the video seen wednesday 
id like to ask this band of fascists what they call the banquets 
and parties they have on public money id like to ask what they 
call the blood and sweat of the masses they use everyday to fatten 
themselves 
wuer made several emotional references to those killed during 
june 34 when chinas army invaded beijing and opened fire on 
unarmed crowds along changan street just off tiananmen square 
i dont know how many martyrs souls remain on changan street 
may they forever rest in peace he said 
he said he left tiananmen square on the night of the military 
sweep in an ambulance 
there was a classmate shot in the head and chest his skull was 
shattered his stomach was still gurgling blood he said 
a soldier was with them shot by his own troops apparently by 
mistake he said 
there were three people including myself spitting blood as i 
lay there unable to move the classmate later died 
we were so peaceful we were so naive he said describing 
the student protesters we never thought the shamelessness and 
viciousness of those wild beasts would go to such an extent 
wuer said many people were killed in tiananmen square 
contradicting the governments account that nobody died there 
a lot of my classmates were crushed to death by tanks they 
were completely flattened by tanks on tiananmen square he said 
he quoted a classmate as saying soldiers used shovels to stack 
the bodies wrapping them in plastic and burning them on the square 
wuer urged his countrymen to band together and fight the 
government 
all the participants in the movement must struggle to the 
end he said they are like the boat trackers paying with their 
blood and their lives pulling this big boat that is china upriver 
pulling this old boat to the glorious sea 
despite his weak demeanor wuer said he was ok 
there were innumerable tribulations and a narrow escape from 
death but im still safe he said on the tape the second of his 
statements released by the underground network 
in a letter dated june 15 wuer said that a black sun has 
appeared in the sky of my motherland and republic 
but our life is young stubborn and uncrushable black sun 
im going to shoot you down

auto insurers have promised a court 
challenge of legislation that would force them to roll back rates to 
15 percent below july 1988 levels for new policies starting next 
october 
the measure was passed tuesday by the state assembly and senate 
and sent to gov bob miller and aides said the governor will sign 
it 
nevada has the fifthhighest car insurance rates in the nation 
with an average premium of 600 per driver according to the state 
insurance commissioner 
the measure would let insurers raise rates only if they could 
prove to the insurance commissioner that they would go bankrupt 
without the increase 
that is the toughest in my opinion rate rollback bill in 
america said assemblyman gene porter who negotiated the rollback 
with the senate 
the assembly approved the measure 375 and the state senate then 
voted 164 for it 
auto insurers termed unconstitutional a provision taking into 
account profits from fire health and life insurance when deciding 
whether an insurer could raise rates on auto liability coverage 
the language in this bill is more patently unconstitutional 
than the language in prop 103 american insurance assocation 
spokesman jim wadhams said referring to a california rate rollback 
parts of proposition 103 were struck down by that states supreme 
court on grounds they denied insurers a fair return on their 
investments 
wadhams also complained that lawmakers hadnt let insurers 
participate in compromise negotiations 
the insurance commissioners office estimates auto insurance 
prices have risen 5 percent in the last year making the bills 
average rollback more than 20 percent 
state sen bob coffin criticized the bill as inadequate saying 
legislators were winning safe political gains by voting for a bill 
they knew a court would strike down later as unconstitutional 
its probably the assembly version of crack cocaine theyre 
going to feel good for a few minutes and then it will go away 
coffin said 
state sen nick horn said lawmakers nearing the end of the 
legislative session finally had to respond to voters calls to 
control insurance costs 
weve been hearing tales of pricegouging all along horn 
said this finally serves the people by providing some rollbacks 
porter who headed a study commission on auto insurance costs 
had submitted 14 different insurance reform proposals this session 
including a rate rollback of as much as 37 percent 
after the senate commerce and labor committee delayed action on 
that rollback lawmakers agreed to insert porters insurance rules 
into a 10 percent rollback proposed by state sen jack vergiels

evan makopoulos and his mother paula of parsippany they claimed 
they should be allowed to sue in new jersey because of the 
difficulty of attending a trial in florida where disney world is

polishamerican leaders urged president bush on 
wednesday to provide millions of dollars in new aid for poland to 
forestall economic turmoil that could doom moves toward democracy in 
the communist bloc nation 
they said bush assured them he has already begun talking with 
western allies about debt relief for poland which bush will visit 
july 911 
the polish american congress leaders including president edward 
j moskal of chicago did not put a price tag on how big a relief 
package they had in mind other than saying it should be a 
multimillion dollar one 
bush went to the polishamerican community of hamtramck mich 
april 17 to propose new aid for poland tied to government reforms 
including recognition of solidarity debtrelief and moves to 
encourage private enterprise 
bush reiterated tuesday that he would have an aid package for 
poland but said he will insist that poland itself will have taken 
the steps necessary to have the money wellspent i dont want to 
just push money down the drain 
marlin fitzwater the white house spokesman said the aid package 
is still being developed in the national security council 
poland owes 39 billion only 25 billion of it to the united 
states 
asked if they were satisfied with the approach bush outlined in 
hamtramck moskal said wed like to see a little more but we 
didnt come asking for pie in the sky 
moskal who is also president of the polish national alliance 
said we need some substantial assistance primarily with private 
enterprise restructuring of the loan aid for the ecological 
situation there the agriculture situation a general uplifting 
were also looking for some sign that the people will be able 
to grasp and say well theres a future for them yet he said 
theres so much need over there the economys a shambles 
youve got 45 years of communism over there which is nothing less 
than bankruptcy said moskal 
he said bush told them he was advocating restructuring of polish 
debt in the paris club of creditor nations in the international 
montetary fund and in the world bank 
there are steps being taken and from what we gathered there 
are steps already being taken with the other western allies 
including great britain west germany and france he said 
in poland moskal said both the communist government and the 
solidarity movement realize what the stakes are nobodys 
looking for a china solution over there 
jan nowak national director of the polish american congress 
what is needed is something that would allay the danger of some 
upheaval in the next six months 
any suppression by force of massive strikes or riots would 
bring to power stalinists hardliners who are already feeding on 
the election defeat and that would mean the chinese scenario said 
nowak 
if the polish experiment would end in failure following so soon 
the chinese experience it would have a tremendous negative impact 
on the process of changes in the entire soviet orbit said nowak 
so the stakes are very high i have an impression the president 
understands this very well

a former us navy intelligence analyst who spied 
for the soviet union cracked under the pressure of his work before 
he committed suicide the head of the kgb said wednesday 
defector glenn michael souther killed himself june 22 at age 32 
according to soviet officials 
his nervous system could not stand the pressure said gen 
vladimir kryuchkov 
after his obituary in the soviet military newspaper red star 
listed his name as mikhail y orlov speculation arose that souther 
had been a soviet mole but kryuchkov discounted that saying he was 
a nativeborn american 
souther never admitted spying he had been under investigation by 
the fbi when he disappeared in 1986 from his job as a civilian 
intelligence specialist in the navys 2nd fleet headquarters in 
norfolk va 
his obituary tuesday in red star an illustrated article on him 
wednesday in the government newspaper izvestia and kryuchkovs 
comments amounted to unusual publicity for any kgb officer and a 
rare soviet admission of spying 
but kryuchkov shrugged off the disclosures saying you have 
spies we have spies 
soviet reports on southers death said he was driven to betray 
his country because of a fear of nuclear war and a growing interest 
in russian culture 
his nerves were a problem even in the several years he spied 
before defecting in 1986 kryuchkov told reporters outside the 
meeting hall of the soviet legislature 
he long ago started to show a nervous state of mind he was a 
gifted emotional caring sensitive person he was easily hurt 
the kgb chief said 
kryuchkov would not say how souther took his life but that the 
motive was not political 
he said souther left a note thanking the soviet government for 
what it did for him personally 
izvestia said souther took the name mikhail orlov only after he 
arrived in the soviet union it said he was born in hammond ind 
which the fbi confirmed 
southers parents brother and sister traveled to moscow for his 
military funeral monday the kgb chief said he was buried in the 
military section of kuntsevo cemetery the resting place of british 
traitor kim philby 
the izvestia article was accompanied by two photographs one of a 
cleanshaven souther at a chess board and the other showing him with 
a full dark beard 
souther enlisted in the us navy in 1975 and became petty 
officer first class before being honorably discharged in 1982 
according to us records 
izvestia said he served as a military photographer aboard the 
nuclearpowered aircraft carrier nimitz in the us 6th fleet and 
on other navy ships in the mediterranean sea 
there he comprehended the real danger of the nuclear threat 
which pushed him into fight against it in the ranks of soviet 
intelligence izvestia said 
souther then went to work for us nayy intelligence analyzing 
satellite photographs and worked with topsecret information at the 
norfolk base izvestia said it was there his worries over nuclear 
war led to an internal breakup the newspaper said 
through his russian language studies at old dominion university 
in virginia he saw in the ussr a country that was closer to 
his soul and his convictions izvestia said 
some of the people who knew souther at old dominion speculated he 
committed suicide because of his disillusionment with the soviet 
union 
they used him like a spider playing with a moth and when they 
were going to finish with him they finished with him said 
barbara fahey a professors wife who knew him in school 
ronald kessler a us writer preparing a book on souther said 
the defector referred to my lifes vicissitudes in a letter he 
sent the writer this month he was perhaps having second thoughts 
or having trouble adjusting over there kessler said 
souther was survived by a russian wife and an 18monthold 
daughter according to soviet news reports

japan facing the threat of heavy trade 
sanctions has agreed to open its multibilliondollar tokyo 
marketplace to us cellular telephones and to loosen restraints on 
business radios us trade representative carla hills said 
wednesday 
the agreement which focused on motorola incs attempts to 
extend its cellular business into the lucrative tokyonagoya region 
averts a showdown on july 10 when the united states had said it was 
prepared to slap tariffs of as much as 100 percent on more than 50 
japanese electronics imports 
mrs hills who announced the agreement after talks here with 
officials representing japans ministry of posts and 
telecommunications said she hoped the settlement will be a 
precedent for the entire telecommunications market in japan 
the united states had a trade deficit with japan of about 52 
billion last year and the motorola problem became a test of how new 
japanese prime minister sosuke uno would treat the festering 
usjapan trade issue 
the agreement affects cellular phones and thirdparty radios 
such as equipment used for dispatching taxis and delivery trucks 
and pagers 
it will be particularly advantageous for motorolas new 
pocketsized cellular phone which the company is just bringing to 
market at about 2500 a copy 
motorola the principal american maker of cellular phones and 
business radios had contended the japanese restrictions cost 2 
billion in lost sales over five years 
the measures should provide immediate improvements for us 
companies in these two highgrowth segments of the japanese 
telecommunications market mrs hills said there should be 
significant additional benefits when fully implemented 
she said the agreement forestalls us retaliation against 
japanese exports 
mrs hills said the japanese agreed to changes in licensing 
procedures for thirdparty radio companies improved access to the 
broadcast spectrum needed for thirdparty radio and cellular phones 
sold by foreign companies and adoption of other rules which will 
treat foreign thirdparty radio companies on a more equitable 
basis 
the list of potential targets for higher us tariffs had 
included japanese color television sets tape recorders and 
photocopying machines that variety of goods including some of the 
most popular japanese electronic devices sold in this country 
emphasized how seriously the administration was taking this issue 
rep nancy johnson rconn who led a campaign by 16 members of 
the house to persuade the japanese to negotiate said once the 
japanese realized we were deadly serious about this problem they 
moved quickly to help settle it todays agreement is proof positive 
that our trade law can work to help open markets and also that we 
should not be shy about confronting our trading partners on problems 
such as this 
the us trade representatives office on april 28 declared that 
japan had violated a 1986 trade agreement by limiting motorolas 
sales it said the united states would act against japanese products 
on july 10 
informal negotiations have been held for the past several weeks 
and japan sent an envoy ichiro ozawa to washington last week for 
steppedup talks 
motorola which is based in schaumberg ill has sold its 
cellular phones in japan since 1987 through a japanese company 
dainidenden inc but motorolas phones would not work in japans 
largest market the tokyo area because the motorola equipment is 
not compatible with the cellular phone network operated by the 
nippon telegraph amp telephone corp 
the japanese government had said there was not enough space 
available on tokyos crowded airwaves to accommodate motorolas 
system but last year the government assigned new frequencies to a 
japanese company convenience radio telephone prompting motorola to 
complain to the bush administration motorola spokesman rusty 
brashear said 
in the negotiations the japanese agreed to shift allocations of 
airwave space from a japanese company ido to allow motorolas 
agent dainidenden access part of the broadcast spectrum in the 
tokyo area immediately further access will be phased in later in 
tokyo and other areas of the country for both ddi and ido brashear 
said

the nations 60yearold farmpolicy pendulum 
is swinging away from reliance on government toward the free market 
according to a private study released wednesday 
the evolution of agricultural policy toward less government 
intervention and control is a very positive trend based on 
fundamental economic and social changes the report said 
agriculture today is very different than it was in the 1930s 
when most of our current programs were designed 
the study released by washington consultants lesher russell and 
moos for the agricultural policy working group said agriculture is 
a much more integral part of the national economy today than 60 
years ago 
farms also are more similar to other businesses across the nation 
than those of half a century ago the study said 
farm law passed in 1985 expires next year and congress has begun 
preliminary work on a 1990 bill 
although the current law the food security act of 1985 is 
noted for its major commodity programs and their various 
pricesupport mechanisms it also ranges widely with programs for 
food stamps nutrition conservation trade credit research and 
many other functions 
the study concentrates on the crop programs including wheat 
feed grains cotton and soybeans and their effect on the nations 
economy 
officials of the consulting company include bill lesher and randy 
russell senior economists in the agriculture department in the 
early reagan years and chief architects of the 1985 farm 
legislation gene moos is a former agricultural aide to rep tom 
foley dwash now house speaker 
members of the sponsoring group are major companies deeply 
involved in agriculturally related enterprises cargill inc 
central soya company inc louis dreyfus corp imc fertilizer group 
inc monsanto co nabisco brands inc and norfolk southern corp 
the study was done by government research corp part of the 
public relations firm hill and knowlton and economic perspectives 
inc of mclean va since last fall part of sparks commodities inc 
of memphis tenn 
one course the study said would be for congress to extend 
current farm law which is regarded to have worked well but 
tacking on another five years would produce a stagnant sector 
severely limited by sluggish market growth 
another option calling for planting flexibility would retain 
the basic structure of the 1985 farm law but without specific crop 
acreage bases instead the acreage bases for such crops as wheat 
corn and cotton plus the acreage typically planted to soybeans 
would be combined into a single farm base 
acreage idling programs would still be used to control 
production but the setasides would be from the whole farm base 
not specific crop bases 
the flexibility option over five years would result in smaller 
annual carryover supplies or surpluses faster market growth and 
somewhat higher incomes for farmers the report said 
a third option would be another form of decoupling which would 
continue historical federal income supports to farmers but without 
annual requirements for idling specific crop acreages farmers would 
be free to plant what they choose 
the report said decoupling would require a transition period 
during which prices and sales receipts would decline but that 
declining farm income could be avoided by making federal income 
support payments larger in the early years 
following about two years of adjustment increased market 
growth would bring price recovery and higher incomes as well the 
report said

allegedly stole hundreds of cars in new york 
before the conclusion of that case castellano was gunned down 
outside a midmanhattan restaurant in december 1985 eventually six 
of the eight defendants remaining in that trial were convicted of 
various charges

arena a hitmanturnedinformer who admitted his part in four 
slayings and francis mickey featherstone a onetime enforcer 
for the westies a predominantly irish gang on manhattans west side

ustica 44 sol hellman 63 joseph testa 34 salvatore mangialino 
52 douglas rega 39 and carlo profeta whose age was unavailable

israeli troops wednesday shot and killed a 
palestinian radical who kidnapped an american relief worker last 
week the army said 
earlier a bomb wounded three israelis and an arab in a crowded 
openair market in the israeli town of ramle and vengeful israelis 
stabbed two arabs police said paramilitary police rushed to the 
town near tel aviv to prevent further violence against arabs 
the dead palestinian radical mohammed abu nasr was identified 
as leader of a threeman gang that abducted chris george of 
montclair nj on june 22 
israel television and arab reports said nasr was in a taxi he had 
hijacked when soldiers shot him he was carrying a pistol and two 
clips of bullets said an army statement that gave no details of the 
shooting 
george was freed unharmed after a day when he agreed to carry a 
letter from nasr pleading with president bush to recognize 
palestinian rights 
the army said nasr is suspected of two other gaza strip attacks 
this month in one an israeli military government employee was shot 
and wounded and in the other an israeli gasoline truck driver was 
hit in the head with an ax 
israeli news reports said george was abducted by the palestine 
liberation organization but yasser arafats organization maintains 
nasr acted on his own and was mentally deranged 
nasr who was in his late 30s had been jailed for being a member 
of arafats fatah faction and was released in a 1985 prisoner swap 
george 35 declined comment on his kidnappers death 
in the occupied west bank and gaza strip meanwhile israeli 
troops wounded at least 13 palestinians in clashes with 
stonethrowers and a man died of injuries suffered in a beating by 
youths who accused him of collaborating with israel 
his death brings the toll to 538 palestinians killed since arabs 
started revolting against israeli occupation in december 1987 
sixtynine have been killed by arabs as suspected collaborators 
twentythree israelis also have been killed 
israels supreme court denied a palestinians appeal against 
deportation authorizing the expulsion of the 48th resident of the 
occupied territories since the revolt began it ruled bilal izzidin 
hussein shakhsheer 37 carried out antiisraeli activities for an 
outlawed extremist plo faction 
a survey of 104 leaders in the west bank and gaza showed 83 
percent favor an israeli plan to hold elections for palestinian 
representatives to negotiate with israel but only under certain 
conditions a palestinian magazine reported 
bayader assiyassi said it asked if leaders favored elections on 
condition israeli troops withdraw from occupied cities before 
internationally supervised elections 
eightysix percent of those favoring elections insisted troops be 
withdrawn from all the occupied lands the survey showed 
plo and some palestinian leaders in the occupied lands reject 
prime minister yitzhak shamirs plan saying it does not guarantee 
an independent palestinian state 
in apparent response to rightwing opponents of his plan shamir 
said wednesday that crushing the 18month uprising is israels 
first security objective 
but he added it should be clear that israel has 
consciously and deliberately refrained from taking the ruthless 
measures that could have ended in violence 
he was addressing an international conference of jewish leaders 
where american seymour reich criticized proposals to move an 
expected wave of soviet immigrants to jewish settlements in the 
occupied lands 
soviet jews should be absorbed through the normal process of 
resettlement said reich head of the conference of presidents of 
major jewish organizations 
he noted the us administration likely would object america 
opposes the settlements as an obstacle to a usbacked proposal of 
trading land for peace

thanks to the continuing ceasefire in the 
iraniraq war the pentagon has decided it can revise its deployment 
policy for the indian ocean to one that doesnt require the 
continuous presence of an aircraft carrier defense officials said 
wednesday 
the officials who insisted on anonymity said the united states 
had no intention of withdrawing its naval forces from the indian 
ocean or the persian gulf 
but with the truce still holding in the iraniraq war we dont 
need a nonstop presence explained one official we dont need 
an aircraft carrier parked outside the persian gulf 
before 1980 and the iranian hostage crisis the united states 
routinely sent aircraft carrier battle groups to the indian ocean on 
a staggered basis leaving gaps of as much as a month or two as 
hostilities then heated up in the persian gulf that policy was cast 
aside in favor of keeping at least one aircraft carrier on station 
outside the gulf at all times 
but the ceasefire between iran and iraq will have held up for 
a year in august so were going back to our old approach 
explained one source 
although it attracted little attention the first gap in the navy 
presence already has occurred the aircraft carrier ranger was 
allowed to depart its station outside the gulf in the northern 
arabian sea before a replacement the america arrived in the region 
the america just steamed through the suez canal into the indian 
ocean one official said wednesday but such gaps in coverage will 
become commonplace starting this fall 
the source also said the navy would occasionally send in battle 
groups built around battleships instead of aircraft carriers 
another official said the change in policy was driven in part by 
the recent budget decision of defense secretary dick cheney to 
maintain 14 carriers in the navy instead of 15 
a second source downplayed that factor however saying the key 
reason for the change was the end to the fighting between iran and 
iraq

for the first time in their 71year 
history greeces communists were given a chance wednesday to form a 
government after the socialists and conservatives failed to do so 
the coalition of the left and progress seemed set on using its 
threeday mandate to discuss possibilities of a national unity 
government but efforts to form an allparty government were 
hampered by the two larger parties insistence on leading it 
national elections june 18 failed to produce a winner the 
coalition an antiamerican grouping of the greek communist party 
and the eurocommunist greek left emerged as the power broker with 
28 seats in the 300seat unicameral parliament 
the conservative new democracy party won 145 seats the 
panhellenic socialist movement or pasok came in second with 125 
seats ending eight years of socialist rule 
coalition leader harilaos florakis has been general secretary of 
the communist party since 1974 when it was legalized after the fall 
of the military dictatorship it was founded in 1918 
the coalition rejected a jointrule proposal by pasok leader 
andreas papandreou the hospitalized caretaker premier whose 
mandate to form a government ended tuesday night before that the 
conservatives had tried to form a government 
florakis said his party proposed a government of widespread 
acceptance that would not be led by papandreou or new democracy 
leader constantine mitsotakis 
mitsotakis ruled out formation of a government that would not be 
headed by himself 
how is it possible for the 13 percent of the greek people to 
impose their will on the 44 percent mitsotakis said 
new democracy won 44 percent of the vote pasok 39 and the 
coalition 13 percent 
if the coalition cannot form a government by friday president 
christos sartzetakis will ask the three major parties to try to set 
aside their differences and form a coalition if that fails the 
president will call early elections under a caretaker administration 
pasok officials have tried to reach an agreement with the 
communists on a longterm coalition but rejected proposals that did 
not give papandreou the premiership 
the coalition a strongly antiamerican party calls for the 
removal of us military bases in greece and withdrawal from nato 
papandreou has pledged to put any new agreement with the 
americans on the four bases to a national referendum the previous 
agreement ended in december 
cooperation on national issues includes a referendum on the 
bases said akis tsohatzopoulos a member of pasoks executive 
bureau 
tsohatzopoulos was appointed to negotiate with the communists 
because papandreou was still in athens general state hospital 
papandreou was hospitalized thursday for pneumonia but later 
developed heartand kidney complications a hospital bulletin 
wednesday said he was no longer in critical condition and in 23 
days we will be able to say when he will be dismissed

the federal government not state governors has 
the final authority over the deployment of national guard troops 
outside the united states an appeals court ruled wednesday 
the 8th us circuit court of appeals upheld an amendment that 
prohibits governors from withholding consent to send troops outside 
the country because of objections to the location purpose type or 
schedule of active duty 
we hold that the constitution does not require gubernatorial 
consent to active duty for training of the national guard of the 
united states the court said in its 72 opinion 
the original lawsuit was filed on behalf of minnesota gov rudy 
perpich by hubert h humphrey iii the states attorney general 
minnesota was joined in the suit by the states of colorado 
delaware maine massachusetts ohio and vermont 
opposing them was the defense department which was joined as 
friends of the court by the national guard association of the united 
states and the states of alabama georgia hawaii iowa kentucky 
louisiana maryland mississippi and missouri 
in 1985 and 1986 several governors objected to deployment of 
national guard personnel to central america the governors withheld 
or threatened to withhold their consent to federally ordered active 
duty missions by their states national guard units 
in response congress enacted the montgomery amendment which 
prohibits the governors from withholding consent 
after members of the minnesota national guard participated in 
three active duty training missions in honduras in january 1987 
perpich filed suit seeking a declaration of the governors 
constitutional authority 
perpich asked specifically for a declaration that the montgomery 
amendment infringed on the states right under the constitution to 
train the militia the lawsuit sought to enjoin any federal order 
commanding members of the minnesota unit of the national guard to 
active duty for training outside the country without perpichs 
consent 
a us district court ruled against perpich saying the dual 
enlistment system under which guard members enlist and serve in 
both the state national guard and the federal national guard was a 
proper exercise of congress power to raise and support armies 
a threejudge panel of the 8th us circuit court of appeals 
reversed that ruling however holding that the montgomery amendment 
violated the constitutional authority of states to train its militia 
that ruling said the national guard could not be ordered to 
active duty for training without the consent of the states unless 
congress or the president first declared a national security 
emergency 
the federal government appealed and was granted a rehearing on 
the issue by the full appeals court 
senior circuit judge gerald w heaney strongly disagreed with 
wednesdays ruling 
with a few strokes of the word processor heaney said in his 
dissent the majority has written the militia clause out of the 
united states constitution 
in so doing it contradicts the clear intent of the founding 
fathers who believed that state control over elements of the 
military was essential to a free and peaceful republic

a company said wednesday it has 
canceled a contract to supply iran with chemicals produced in india 
that could be used to make poison gas 
the rheineisen chemical products company of duesseldorf made the 
announcement after west german officials began an investigation into 
whether the firm had violated federal export laws it said the 
delivery would not be made 
also on wednesday federal officials announced west germany was 
trying to block delivery of 257 tons of thionyl chloride before it 
left india for iran 
the duesseldorf company acknowledged it arranged the deal but an 
attorney for the company said customs officials had told it the 
shipment to iran would not violate export laws 
a customs employee confirmed on may 22 that there were no 
objections to the shipment said attorney georg greeven 
dieter vogel spokesman for the economics ministry said 
rheineisen could face prosecution if it is determined an export 
permit was required for the shipment the company did not apply for 
such a permit he said 
west german authorities say the investigation into the deal was 
begun after us officials last week alerted bonn about the 
duesseldorf companys involvement 
west germany has been trying to crack down on illegal exports 
since allegations last year that german companies helped build a 
libyan plant that us officials said was intended to produce 
chemical weapons 
libya said the plant was making pharmaceuticals 
west german authorities arrested the head of the imhausenchemie 
company in connection with the libyan deal 
greeven said rheineisen was able at the last moment to keep 
the first delivery of the chemicals from being loaded aboard a ship 
in india he did not give other details 
the company will not be resuming this transaction he said 
greeven said the chemicals were made by a company in india called 
transpec he did not give the location of the firm he also did not 
indicate whether rheineisen knew the chemical could be used to make 
mustard gas 
company spokesman juergen tigler said if officials had 
expressed any objections to the deal the whole thing would have 
been called off 
doris grimm spokeswoman for the transport ministry said a west 
german shipping company owns the vessel slated to transport the 
chemicals she refused to identify the ship or the company 
she also said the vessel is flying the flag of a foreign country 
which under west german law could make prosecution of its owners 
impossible

a pennsylvania congressman citing the case of 
a 92yearold woman who was dragged out of her home kicking and 
screaming said wednesday that congress should help elderly 
americans who face eviction 
we need a mechanism by which there would be an automatic 
community response to the anguish of an elderly person about to lose 
ones home or be evicted rep george w gekas rpa said in 
testimony before the house subcommittee on human resources 
gekas introduced an amendment in february to the older americans 
act of 1965 that would require states that receive funds under the 
act to notify the area agency on aging when legal procedures are 
begun that would result in a person 65 or older losing his home 
because of nonpayment of debt 
gekas bill would require written notification of the state 
agency within seven days after the proceedings have begun and would 
halt any action for at least 60 days 
the proposed legislation was prompted by last summers eviction 
of effie kapates from her harrisburg pa home the house was sold 
after the 92yearold woman failed to pay back taxes on the property 
she was screaming and squirming and resisting to the last 
moment against sheriffs deputies doing their duty gekas said 
i have an 89yearold mother and i would hate to see her being 
carried from her own home said subcommittee chairman dale kildee 
dmich 
elizabeth a schreffler executive director of the dauphin 
county pa area agency on aging testified that her agency was not 
notified until two weeks before the eviction even though kapates 
had lost title to her house four years earlier 
she would have been eligible to receive a 100 percent tax 
rebate through the auspice of the pennsylvania lottery fund 
schreffler said adding that kapates later moved in with a daughter 
in a way we failed that lady as a community gekas said 
advocates for the elderly generally back the legislation but 
some dont want it linked to state funding 
withholding older american act funding because of the lack of 
action by a state legislature could jeopardize many older persons 
who depend on oaasupported nutrition programs said margaret 
williams president of the national association of area agencies on 
aging

lawyers on wednesday asked a court to 
hear an intelligence agent testify that prime minister olof palme 
may have been shot as part of an international conspiracy 
the request came in the third week of the trial of christer 
pettersson who is charged with shooting palme on feb 28 1986 as 
the swedish leader walked home from a movie with his wife lisbeth 
pettersson a confessed drug abuser with a long criminal record 
denies the killing 
lawyer arne liljeros asked for permission to call janhenrik 
barrling a swedish security police officer who investigated a 
militant kurdish separatist group called the pkk or kurdish workers 
party in connection with the assassination 
we want to establish that the pkk lead is still the most 
credible liljeros said 
prosecutor anders helin objected that barrlings value as a 
witness is not very high since all the information he can give is 
secondhand 
the court will decide thursday whether to call barrling said 
judge carl anton spak 
the kurdish separatists were the focus of a yearlong 
investigation by stockholm police chief hans holmer who was sacked 
when he failed to prove a connection and refused to give up his 
theory of a plot 
police on wednesday began investigating holmer on suspicion of 
misappropriating funds swedens national tt news agency reported 
the kurdish group was branded a terrorist organization by the 
palme government which also denied refugee status to one of its 
leaders telephone taps of some separatist members before the 
killing appeared to indicate some sort of plot 
barrling has been linked to a group that privately pursued the 
kurdish connection he was indicted for helping smuggle in illegal 
eavesdropping equipment and awaits trial justice minister 
annagreta leijon was forced to resign for supporting the amateur 
detectives 
the prosecutions case rests on lisbeth palmes identification of 
pettersson 42 in court as the man she saw a few feet away after 
her husband fell to the ground fatally wounded 
in court wednesday three passersby testified that only one 
person was close enough to palme to shoot him although none could 
support mrs palmes identification two of the witnesses saw the 
man fire a gun 
leif ljungkvist who was stopped at a traffic light when he heard 
the shooting said he saw a man standing near the fallen premier 
stare for several seconds before turning slowly away and fleeing up 
a side street he indicated mrs palme had plenty of time to see the 
gunman 
but he also said mrs palme was unresponsive and in a state of 
shock when he approached her two minutes after the shooting she 
has testified she was clearheaded 
a social worker who knew pettersson in jail also testified that 
the accused showed a deeprooted hatred of authorities which 
prosecutors say could have been his motive

cyprus in 1974 to prevent a possible union with greece and halt 
alleged persecution of the islands turkish minority

the economy is in a state of emergency and up to 
15 million people will lose their jobs during its restructuring the 
official in charge of economic reform said at his confirmation 
hearing wednesday 
leonid abalkin painted the bleak picture before the new supreme 
soviet legislature which approved his nomination as head of state 
commission on economic reform a job carrying the rank of deputy 
premier 
abalkin was among four cabinet members confirmed wednesday after 
the legislature rejected for the first time in soviet history a 
slate of nominees for the government positions 
the situation in the country is that of an emergency abalkin 
said within the last year and a half the economic situation has 
been worsening with every passing month 
the economist said 12 million to 15 million people will become 
unemployed as a result of reform by the end of the century 
according to remarks carried by the tass news agency 
abalkin said the layoffs will occur as the country moves from 
emphasis on production to services and as the labor force is 
redistributed from state businesses to private cooperatives and 
familyrun businesses 
other economists have said unemployment will result from 
streamlining the government and industry and shifting resources 
within the economy 
abalkin the 59yearold director of the institute of economics 
told the legislators the unemployed will need job retraining 
occupational counseling and other social programs 
traditional communist party doctrine has said unemployment is 
solely a western problem resulting from exploitation of the working 
class but president mikhail s gorbachevs program of perestroika 
or economic restructuring is causing widespread realignment of the 
soviet labor force 
abalkin predicted that efforts to make the economy 
marketoriented will be successful in six to seven years at which 
time the soviet currency the ruble can be made convertible 
at it stands the ruble cannot be freely converted into other 
currency and that severely hampers foreign companies trying to do 
business in the soviet union 
abalkin took the podium after his confirmation and said soviet 
efficiency must be improved 
we have a budget deficit of 100 billion rubles 156 billion 
this year he said there are two ways to eliminate it cut 
expenditures or increase revenues 
abalkin explained the poor soviet standard of living with the 
comment we live no worse than we work 
deputies laughed and then applauded 
under questioning from the 542member supreme soviet another 
cabinet nominee yuri maslyukov chairman of the government planning 
agency gosplan said his agency would drastically reduce central 
planning of the economy he was then confirmed as both the new 
gosplan chairman and first deputy premier 
deputy igor griazin of estonia said he had expected more 
controversy over the 52yearold maslyukov but the gosplan chief 
promised his agency would confine itself to setting major economic 
factors such as the federal budget raw materials and military 
production leaving details to the republics 
two months ago he was opposed to all this griazin said 
this is a new guy i like him very much 
there were only six votes against maslyukov the hands raised to 
vote yes were not counted as they were a clear majority 
lev voronin 61 a bureaucrat in the state supply committee was 
confirmed as a first deputy premier in charge of general matters 
igor belousov nominated as deputy premier and head of the state 
commission for militaryindustrial affairs told the lawmakers that 
by 1995 60 percent of the defense industrys production will be 
civilian goods those goods will include equipment to process crops 
consumer items medical equipment electronics computers and 
communications devices belousov said 
gorbachev has said the defense industry will be called on to 
tackle production of items in chronically short supply namely food 
and consumer goods 
on tuesday premier nikolai ryzhkov withdrew seven of his cabinet 
nominees after the newly elected legislature refused to support them 
six of the nominees were rejected in firstever confirmation 
hearings last week by committees of the supreme soviet which this 
year replaced the old rubberstamp legislature the previous 
legislature did not have the power to confirm or reject top 
government officials 
the supreme soviet is the countrys first fulltime 
representative legislature a branch of the larger congress of 
peoples deputies chosen this spring in the first nationwide 
contested elections in seven decades

sevenyearold latricia reese left a hospital to 
the applause of wellwishers wednesday just a day after she was 
rescued from a storm drain where she was trapped for more than 12 
hours by rushing water 
latricia shying away from the throng of reporters and 
photographers who have trailed her since she was found with only 
bruises scrapes and a mild concussion rode away from the hospital 
with a broad smile and a car filled with toys flowers and balloons 
she came through this ordeal in a remarkable fashion shes 
going to be just fine dr george rodriguez said just before 
latricia was released from humana hospitalsouthmore the one 
thing that she needs right now more than anything else is to be at 
home with her mother 
latricia was playing in a flooded ditch monday evening in the 
aftermath of tropical storm allison when she was washed into a 
concrete storm culvert and disappeared into the underground drainage 
system the storm dumped about a foot of rain on the region 
the water was moving so swiftly a police diving team decided 
against entering the unfamiliar sewage system 
when the divers left and promised to come back at daybreak 
latricias mother feared the worst 
they told me it was just a small chance of survival but it 
would be a miracle karen reese said i thought they were coming 
back to search for a body but we got a miracle 
latricia was rescued after her cousin devincent phillips 
spotted two construction workers checking a nearby manhole tuesday 
morning and asked them to help search for the girl 
it was pitch black down there said tim gabrysch who entered 
a manhole near where latricia disappeared he found a little girl 
all scrunched up in that pipe and then she turned and looked at 
me and i thought id bust 
latricia swept by the fastmoving water through several levels 
of the underground drainage system said she managed to grab a crack 
in the concrete passage hold on and keep her head above water until 
the water receded 
the water keeps on coming until when i let go at first the 
ants were biting me i had to let go and then i went down 
further latricia said wednesday 
she suffered a mild concussion and slight shock in the accident 
and often appeared confused or unaware of many aspects of her 
ordeal at times she says only her head was above water other 
times she says only her feet were wet and is unable to describe 
her descent through the sewer system 
asked what she did during the night she said i prayed 
it may well be that she doesnt remember much of what happened 
down there rodriguez said citing the concussion 
i think maybe there are some things she doesnt want to 
remember mrs reese added 
it was a horrible night and a terrible storm but we found a 
rainbow at the end she said

chinas new communist party chief said wednesday 
that government would show no mercy to leaders of the prodemocracy 
movement 
chinese embassies in more than 20 countries said their 
ambassadors were being recalled to beijing and a diplomatic source 
said they were to meet to discuss the military crackdown on the 
movement for a freer society 
party general secretary jiang zemin said the work of quelling 
the counterrevolutionary rebellion and putting an end to the turmoil 
must be firmly carried on 
we should thoroughly expose and mete out according to law 
timely and severe punishments to the plotters organizers and 
behindthescenes commanders the official xinhua news agency 
quoted him as saying in his first public comments since being named 
party chief saturday 
for them an iota of forgiveness should not be given jiang 
added 
his comments were in line with his reputation as a political 
hardliner 
as party boss in shanghai chinas largest city he took a strong 
stand against political dissent and press freedom that went beyond 
limits acceptable to the party 
jiang 62 replaced party chief zhao ziyang who was stripped of 
his party posts for expressing sympathy for the studentled 
prodemocracy movement 
the government says fewer than 300 people half of them soldiers 
were killed when thousands of troops clashed with civilians in the 
streets and drove protesters from tiananmen square on june 34 
chinese witnesses and western intelligence reports say the death 
toll could be as high as 3000 mostly civilians 
in assessing chinas political agenda jiang said an emphasis on 
fundamentalist communist ideology doesnt mean any change in the 
partys policy on intellectuals and the policy of letting a hundred 
flowers blossom and a hundred schools of thought contend 
he was referring to a movement initiated by the late leader mao 
tsetung who in 1957 encouraged philosophical debate intellectuals 
who spoke out against the party however were persecuted and purged 
jiang also known for vigorously promoting economic ties with the 
west said china must push ahead with reforms but distinguish 
between socialistoriented and capitalistoriented change 
he also said beijing would not alter its policies toward hong 
kong which reverts to chinese control in 1997 and taiwan with 
which china hopes to hold reunification talks 
jiangs comments came as china summoned its ambassadors home and 
the legislature prepared to convene thursday to endorse the 
governments crackdown on political dissent 
embassies in west germany italy yugoslavia the philippines 
australia turkey egypt spain poland and belgium were among those 
that said their ambassadors had left or would return to beijing soon 
embassy spokesmen in washington moscow and vienna however said 
their envoys would remain at their posts 
most embassies said the diplomats were returning for for 
scheduled vacation or annual home leave 
a diplomatic source in beijing said they would probably meet july 
7 for instruction on the governments position on the prodemocracy 
movement that a small group bent on overthrowing the government 
and communist party were behind the unrest 
the envoys also probably will discuss how to stop the rash of 
defections by chinese diplomats overseas the source said 
we assume theyre going to give them the government line and 
tell them to go out and sell it and stop your people from 
defecting the diplomat said speaking on condition of anonymity 
more than 20 chinese diplomats reportedly have asked for 
political asylum in north america europe and japan since the 
military crackdown began 
also on wednesday radio beijing announced the arrest of yu 
zhenbing 27 for forming a counterrevolutionary organization in 
western qinghai province and spreading antigovernment propaganda 
since the crackdown began more than 1800 people have been 
arrested and the government says it has executed 27 prodemocracy 
activists 
most of the student leaders wanted by the government have eluded 
capture and one was seen in an emotional videotaped message played 
for reporters wednesday in hong kong 
student leader wuer kaixi vowed on the videotape to continue his

a juror in the oliver north trial testified 
wednesday that she gave incorrect background information to the 
court because she forgot that her brother had been sent to prison 
for armed robbery 
tara leigh king who was on the panel that convicted north on 
three irancontra charges last month had said no when asked on 
a jury selection form whether you or any member of your immediate 
family had been involved in any court proceeding or investigation 
when i filled this out i had forgotten about it miss king 
said during a 90minute hearing 
norths lawyers had asked for a hearing saying that her 
misstatement raises serious questions as to juror bias and 
impartiality and suggests that defendant was deprived of his right 
to exercise peremptory and causal challenges in an informed manner 
north a former aide on the national security council was at the 
defense table with four of his lawyers but took no part in the 
proceeding 
us district judge gerhard a gesell said he will rule thursday 
whether the jury was tainted by the events his most serious remedy 
would be to grant a mistrial 
norths sentencing had been set for june 23 but was postponed to 
july 5 when the juror problem arose he faces a maximum prison time 
of 10 years for aiding and abetting in obstruction of congress 
destroying or mutilating official documents and accepting a gratuity 
miss king said when she filled out the questionnaire on feb 1 
she also had not remembered being questioned by detectives 
receiving a subpoena appearing before the grand jury and about her 
mother telling her that her brother was in prison 
i had forgotten about it after i shed tears she said it 
stuck with me but not until the point where he got out 
the brother samuel king 51 was in prison from mid1987 to 
mid1988 for armed robbery 
in the questioning it was brought out that samuel and tara both 
lived at home miss king said she was one of 15 children eight boys 
and seven girls 
is it a little embarrassing to talk about this asked brendan 
sullivan norths lawyer 
yes it is said miss king 
she explained that she forgot about samuels arrest at 
christmastime 1986 it wasnt a nice thing to think about she 
said adding i had a job to go to i could not let it tear me 
down i had to live my life 
sullivan also brought out that four other brothers had been 
involved in criminal matters and that a sister had gone to court in 
a child custody suit 
but miss king said she had not known anything about any of those 
her misstatements on the juror form came to light during an 
investigation by norths lawyers miss king had been one of the few 
jurors to grant extensive interviews to the news media following the 
trial and she admitted to having used cocaine until four months 
before the trial 
gesell said wednesdays hearing would have been held behind 
closed doors had it not been for that 
the reason for the public hearing is that miss king herself 
chose to accept the overtures of the press he said simply 
start playing this game with the press and you have to play it the 
whole way 
like all others chosen for the jury miss king said before the 
trial that she had not heard seen or read about north at the time 
when he testified before congressional committees in 1987 
she was asked by prosecutor john keker whether she had any 
preference for or against north when she filled out the 
questionnnaire 
no said miss king i was doing what i was asked to do and i 
was answering the qestions as good as i could i had forgotten the 
situation about my brothers

the massachusetts state seal with its sword poised 
above the head of an indian and the latin motto by the sword we 
seek peace has endured for 209 years but some american indians 
say thats far too long 
on wednesday a group of wampanoag indians took the first step 
changing the emblem the legislatures state administration 
committee unanimously recommended a bill setting up a study 
commission on the seal 
the genocide of american indians has just begun to subside 
lately said john peters of mashpee known among his wampanoag 
friends as slow turtle weve had to get through a lot of turmoil 
just to be survivors this sword over the indians head encourages 
that kind of attitude toward us its all right to kill indians 
the seal dating back to 1780 and updated to its present form in 
1898 appears on state stationery legislation the state flag 
prominent public walls the cover of the state budget and the back 
of gov michael s dukakis official chair among other places 
in the center of the seal stands an indian clad in deerskin and 
holding a bow and arrow a right arm bearing an english broad sword 
is poised above the indian and the motto printed in latin on a 
ribbon around the shield translates by the sword we seek peace 
but peace only under liberty 
in completing a modernization of the seal in 1898 anthropologist 
charles willoughby used the skeleton of an indian unearthed in 
winthrop a town just northeast of boston for the scale of the 
body a living indian little shell of the ojibway tribe on lake 
superior agreed to model for the head the seal looked much the 
same prior to 1898 but different versions were in circulation and 
the state wanted a single authoritative seal 
a contemporary description of willoughbys efforts tells of red 
men and poor savages the author e h garrett writes 
during the progress of the work of preparing the seal many people 
objected that an indian did not and should not stand for the state 
of massachusetts 
state rep byron rushing said the yankee politicians who 
conferred over the seal that year cared little about the american 
indian 
there was a judgment made by a bunch of gentlemen one afternoon 
at the parker house hotel and im not sure what they were 
drinking said rushing a boston democrat who is a supporter of 
the study commission bill 
five members of the wampanoag tribe wearing street clothes and 
indian jewelry attended wednesdays legislative hearing and 
presented their case for a more sensitive view of the american 
indian 
if approved by the legislature the study commission would 
consist of two senate members three from the house three american 
indians and four other appointed or elected officials 
what we want to do here is not to make any radical changes but 
to clear up the errors rushing said 
one possible alternative proposed by the wampanoags looks like 
the current seal from a distance but depicts a pine tree instead of 
a sword over the indians head the indian is drawn to resemble 
indians who lived in massachusetts when english settlers first 
arrived 
and in the indians hand instead of a bow and arrow is a peace 
pipe

a small corroded bell plucked from 
siltcovered rubble at a depth of 1500 feet may herald the find of 
the richest ship from a spanish treasure fleet that sank in a 
hurricane 350 years ago salvors said wednesday 
the pirates are not dead quipped dan bagley part of the 
venture which found the ships bell and put it on display 
the bronze bell corroded through on one side was retrieved by 
the crew of the tampabased research vessel seahawk 50 miles off key 
west where the nuestra senora de la merced was believed to have 
gone down during a 1622 hurricane with a load of treasure 
the bell eight inches wide and 11 inches tall is inscribed 
under the lip a marking that researchers hope will identify the 
sunken ship bagley said it will be sent in the few days to 
floridas state archaeologist jim miller to examine test and date 
we dont have any idea what we found if the bell doesnt tell 
us we wont know until we bring up something else said bagley a 
director of fox ridge capital corp parent company of rv seahawk 
inc and seahawk deep ocean technology 
the merced was believed to have been carrying twice as much 
silver gold and jewels as the nuestra senora de la atocha which 
was found in 1985 nearer key west by treasure hunter mel fisher he 
valued his find at 400 million 
the merced keeps being brought up because it makes great 
headlines bagley admitted the merced was the richest ship that 
went through there bringing riches to europe thats what we hope it 
is we know its from the same time period we know it was lost in 
deep water but other ships were lost in deep water too 
we havent counted our money yet 
the crew of the 85foot research vessel located and photographed 
the bell in april and retrieved it last week with a remoteoperated 
vehicle carrying a television camera 
its worth a fortune in history greg stemm a tampa 
advertising firm owner and a partner in the venture said of the 
bell 
stemm said the bell will be used to strengthen his companys 
federal admiralty claim to the wreck admiralty law governs 
shipwrecks found in international waters in this case more than 12 
miles from the us coast 
television pictures of the pile of rubble may also provide clues 
as to whether its actually the remains of a 17thcentury spanish 
galleon 
the videos revealed remnants of ships timbers and olive jars of 
the type used by spaniards to store food and water on sea voyages 
bagley said 
archaeologist miller viewed the videos of the ship wreck and said 
the historical value of the find is significant 
this particular wreck is more like a time capsule it sank and 
it hasnt been touched since that time miller said 
by the end of the summer the salvors will begin to retrieve 
artifacts with a remoteoperated vehicle being built in aberdeen 
scotland 
so far they have spotted ballast rock an object that looks like 
a crucifix circular objects that could be bracelets and about 50 
of the olive jars in the collapsed rubble which appears to be piled 
in a mound about 100 long and 30 feet high miller said 
stemm 32 along with bagley and john morris hooked up with 
robert marx a treasure hunter and author who provided the 
coordinates for the find according to marx 20 years ago a 
fishermans net pulled up part of one of the jars but the technology 
available then was not capable of locating and photographing or 
retrieving anything at that depth 
using his information we first went out with sonar and it 
checked out it looked promising bagley said 
we could have gone down with grab buckets and brought up the 
whole thing but we abhor that idea we want to do it right he 
said 
we dont want to blow it by just bringing it up bagley said

they said ochoa decorated for his service as a field commander 
in angola in 19871988 had damaged cubas reputation and threatened 
its national security

smugglers and had helped turn cuba into a caribbean stop for 
usbound cocaine

arrested worked for the interior ministry which is in charge of 
internal security

diamond and ivory traffic and described hiding money in 
refrigerators and under cement slabs in backyards nearly all said 
their purpose was to help cuba with its economic problems

sentence should come to pass i want you to know that my last 
thought will be for fidel and the great revolution he has given our 
country 
he was asked by ulises rosales del toro president of the court 
whether he had sought to challenge castros power or policies and 
replied of course there is nothing to that i have never been 
opposed to the revolution

state department deputy spokesman richard boucher said wednesday 
that mobutu has taken steps to correct such abuses 
human rights problems and deficiencies are part of our ongoing

efforts by nuclear power supporters to simplify 
and shorten reactor licensing suffered a major setback wednesday in 
the house energy and commerce committee 
by a vote of 2220 the panel voted to omit from a nuclear 
regulatory commission budget bill a provision that would have 
allowed a utility to get both a construction permit and an operating 
license at the same time 
under current law the nuclear regulatory commission must hold 
hearings after construction is complete on whether to grant an 
operating license 
a major streamling of commission rules that took effect last 
month limits the issues that can be raised in hearings on an 
operating license but without legislation the commission may not do 
away with that step 
the industry believes the new commission rules will not amount to 
the simplification the commission expects and will not do enough to 
remove uncertainty 
the industry has complained for years that the twostage process 
takes too much time and causes too much financial risk since the 
second hearing opens the door to lastminute challenges that can 
kill plants that already are completed 
rep william dannemeyer rcalif earlier this month narrowly 
won an energy and commerce subcommittee vote to attach his onestage 
licensing amendment to the nrc spending bill for the 1990 fiscal 
year that starts oct 1 
the proposal was killed however in wednesdays vote by the full 
committee the panel was scheduled to continue debate on the 
spending bill thursday 
lando w zech the nrc chairman told a news conference wednesday 
at commission headquarters that he still believes the rule has set 
the stage for getting nuclear plants built in six years or less 
that is about half the time required currently 
zech who is retiring from the commission on friday cited the 
rule as one of the most important accomplishments of his three years 
as head of the agency he is completing five years on the 
commission following a 42year career in the navy 
he said he was confident that an 11year hiatus in new orders for 
nuclear plants would end and that public concerns about safety 
would be overcome 
nuclear power plants are safer today than they ever have 
been he said 
zech will be replaced as chairman by kenneth carr who has served 
on the commission since 1986 zech who turns 66 on thursday said 
he was unsure of his future plans

a top el salvadoran defense official told vice 
president dan quayle on wednesday that president alfredo cristiani 
will establish a human rights commission in that strifetorn country 
rene emilio ponce chief of staff of el salvadors armed forces 
disclosed the plans in a meeting with quayle at the white house 
quayle spokesman david beckwith said ponce informed the vice 
president that the commission will be composed of three independent 
citizens with a mandate to ensure that the government including the 
military respects human rights 
ponce is considered a leading candidate to become defense 
minister in el salvador under the new conservative cristiani 
admnistration after the current caretaker minister completes a 
sixmonth term 
quayle visited el salvador last month on his second central 
american trip and admonished rightwing leaders there including 
cristiani associate roberto daubuisson to avoid human rights 
abuses 
quayle told reporters at the outset of his meeting with ponce 
that he stands by his message of wanting to see no embarrassments 
to the cristiani government 
lets not have any kind of overreaction to the brutal killings 
that have been going by the fmln in el salvador he said 
the fmln was trying to overthrow the government even before 
cristianis party came to power it is blamed for several recent 
assassinations including the killing of el salvadors attorney 
general and jose antonio rodriquez porth cristianis chief of staff 
quayle said he met with both right and leftwing politicians in 
el salvador because he wanted to reach as wide a political 
spectrum as possible 
some democrats in congress have criticized quayle for meeting 
with daubuisson but quayle said his critics have been silent about 
the killings by the left 
its a total oneway street and certainly something i dont 
accept said quayle 
they have very narrow minds when it comes to the enforcement of 
human rights only on one side were taking human rights across 
the board he said 
according to beckwith quayle told ponce the salvadoran military 
has made great progress on its human rights record and praised it 
for refusing to respond to the violent provocations by the fmln

a hispanic child is born into poverty in the 
united states every 3 minutes according to a report by a latino 
advocacy group that says the needs of these people are overlooked by 
federal policymakers 
the report by the national association of latino elected and 
appointed officials released this week said 394 percent of all 
hispanic children were living in poverty 11611 for a family of 
four in 1987 
moreover the increasing growth of the hispanic population a 
community which has increased by 30 percent from 1980 to 1987 in 
addition to the relative youth of the community compounds an 
already alarming situation the report said simply stated 
significant numbers of hispanic children constitute a population at 
risk 
while hispanic children comprise approximately 10 percent of all 
children in the united states they represent 27 percent of all 
children in poverty the report said 
yet the unique needs of hispanic children in poverty continue 
to be overlooked by the nations federal policymakers civil 
affairs researchers and the media the report said 
the nations hispanic population jumped from 143 million in 1980 
to 175 million in 1985 through a combination of high birth rates 
and international migration according to census bureau estimates 
released last week 
although they were only 63 percent of the us population in 
1980 hispanics made up about onefourth of the 12 million national 
population increase during the next halfdecade the census bureau 
said

the defense department continued to discipline 
errant contractors at a nearrecord pace in the first half of fiscal 
1989 excluding 307 companies or individuals from bidding on 
military work 
the bidding rights of another 325 contractors were temporarily 
suspended because of wrongdoing 
the 307 debarments fell five short of the sixmonth record of 312 
established during the second half of fiscal 1988 
the figures were released wednesday in the latest semiannual 
report to congress by the pentagons inspector general it covers 
oct 1 1988 to march 31 
inspector general june gibbs brown said investigators conducted 
significant fraud investigations on matters like defective pricing 
product substitution and false claims 
those efforts to curb defective and substandard products 
conspiracy and labor cost mischaring resulted in monetary recoveries 
of 258 million she said in the report 
the inspector general maintains a staff of auditors and 
investigators who operate outside the control of top pentagon 
executives the office was created in 1983 
the report dated may 30 discloses that auditors issued more 
than 26000 new contract audits involving 124 billion worth of work 
during the sixmonth period the auditors either disallowed or saved 
for other uses more than 22 billion through the audits the report 
said 
us army corps of engineers auditors saved an estimated 67 
million by challenging questionable awards or future contracting 
plans and pentagon auditors saved another 4843 million through 
followup audits aimed at completing cases that led to management 
disputes over the auditors recommendations the report said 
the justice department obtained 455 indictments on behalf of the 
pentagon during the period in addition to 43 indictments at the 
local state or foreign level and 258 recommendations for 
courtsmartial 
among some of the more significant actions cited during the 
period was a settlement with the sundstrand corp of a false claims 
and illegal gratuities case that resulted in a 115 million fine and 
623 million in administrative settlement payments

a state appeals court wednesday upheld 
cincinnati reds manager pete roses bid to stave off a hearing 
before baseball commissioner a bartlett giamatti setting up a 
possible court fight between the two 
the 1st ohio district court of appeals gave rose his second legal 
victory in four days deciding it had no authority to nullify an 
order that temporarily blocks giamatti from holding a hearing to 
decide roses fate 
giamatti is still barred from holding a hearing on allegations 
that rose bet on his own team and from taking any action against the 
manager for two weeks 
another hearing is scheduled july 6 before hamilton county common 
pleas judge norbert a nadel for a preliminary injunction which 
would extend roses protection while the case is prepared for trial 
if baseball cant block the july 6 hearing giamatti will appear 
before nadel to try to convince the judge he is wrong baseball 
lawyer louis l hoynes jr said 
the commissioner will certainly be a witness for us hoynes 
said its important for us for him to be here and he will be 
here 
in an unpredecented ruling nadel decided last sunday that 
giamatti has prejudged rose as guilty and concluded a hearing 
before the commissioner would be pointless giamatti can suspend 
rose for life if he determines the manager bet on his own team 
giamatti said wednesday that the appeals court didnt decide 
whether nadel was correct in his assessment but had concluded it 
had no authority to act giamatti has said he hasnt yet decided 
roses fate 
they didnt affirm judge nadels finding about me they just 
decided they couldnt decide giamatti said 
hoynes gave no indication of baseballs next legal move which 
could turn to the ohio supreme court 
although rose is unbeaten in the state courts evidence supplied 
by his accusers to baseball could give him trouble with federal 
authorities 
rose also is being investigated by a federal grand jury in 
cincinnati looking into whether he listed all his income on his tax 
returns 
testimony in baseballs report on rose alleges he purposely hid 
income from the internal revenue service from race track wagers 
memorabilia sales and public appearances offenses that carry the 
threat of jail and fines

member julia cooke both wearing the familiar green sash from their 
own scouting days

hiring if you look at the members of my staff said mrs bush 
im realy sort of kidding but it wouldnt be such a bad 
idea would it she said

wilson in 1917 five years after the girl scouts were founded today

the house approved and sent to president bush 
wednesday a limited ninemonth extension of the strategic petroleum 
reserve as the nations energy lifejacket in the event of another 
oil embargo 
the senate last week bowed to house demands for a limited 
extension temporarily giving up its plan to expand the reserves 
capacity from 750 million barrels of oil to 1 million barrels by 
early in the next century 
as approved by voice vote in both houses the legislation now 
authorizes the energy department to continue filling the reserve 
with 60000 to 78000 barrels of oil daily only through next march 
without the bills passage the presidents authority to draw 
upon the stockpile in order to counter a dramatic upsurge in oil 
prices from an embargo or other supply disruption would have expired 
june 30 
under current law bush can use the stockpile only in the event 
of a disruption in oil imports 
the senate would have expanded his authority to draw it down also 
if domestic supplies are interrupted such as when oil prices shot 
up dramatically after exxon valdez tanker spill off alaska this 
spring 
rep philip sharp dind chairman of the house energy and power 
subcommittee said that issue along with new proposals for financing 
the reserve such as leasing the oil from foreign suppliers rather 
than buying it will be studied during the next nine months 
the government has spent some 6 billion on building the reserve 
since it was begun in 1975 in response to an arab oil embargo two 
years earlier 
it now has some 570 million barrels slightly less than a 90day 
supply of us imports at current levels stored in salt caverns 
along the texas and louisiana coasts

president daniel ortega 
denied wednesday that his government ordered president jose azcona 
hoyo and three other leaders killed in neighboring honduras as a 
nicaraguan deserter claims 
this man is crazy i wouldnt even want to think that he is 
being manipulated by the honduran government or the gringos 
americans this is madness ortega told the associated press 
orlando solorzano martinez said in tegucigalpa that the leftist 
sandinista government sent him to honduras nine months ago to 
assassinate azcona roman catholic archbishop hector enrique santos 
of tegucigalpa and presidential candidates rafael leonardo callejas 
of the opposition national party and carlos flores facusse of the 
governing liberal party 
ortega briefly answered questions on a visit he made to this town 
near managua where he gave 200 peasant families title deeds to 
plots of farmland 
solorzano spoke at a news conference tuesday in san pedro sula a 
port city 125 miles north of tegucigalpa where he is staying 
he said he and two other military officers entered honduras in 
1988 on a secret mission ordered by the nicaraguan high command 
to assassinate political and military leaders in this country 
solorzano said that instead he deserted because he was tired of 
the corruption and degeneration by the communists in power in my 
country 
nicaraguas foreign minister miguel descoto meanwhile told a 
news conference in the hague netherlands on wednesday that the 
outlook for an early peace settlement in central america was not 
promising he said ussponsored military in the region were 
blocking such an agreement 
descoto said the civilian presidents of some central american 
nations are hostages of the military and limited in what they 
can do and how far they can go 
but he said nicaragua was going ahead with general elections 
scheduled for next year and that the sandinistas were ready to 
yield power if defeated 
he said his government definitely wanted better relations 
with the bush administration adding we told them that we were 
waiting at the negotiating table but so far i see no 
indications for improvement yet 
descoto said washington still supported hondurasbased rebels 
fighting the managua government despite a 1986 world court ruling 
banning such support 
descoto was in the hague to attend a foreign ministers 
conference of the movement of nonaligned countries

through all the twists of glasnost one figure in 
soviet history has stood above criticism vladimir ilych lenin but 
an official magazine now has breached that taboo with a vehement 
attack on the man who led the communists to power in russia 
lenin all victories of the party and the state are linked 
with the name of lenin wrote vasily grossman in a work published 
posthumously in the june issue of the oktyabr literary magazine 
but all cruelty committed in the country has become the tragic 
burden of vladimir ilych 
grossman charges that soviet political terror and dictatorship 
were begun by lenin and not by his successor josef stalin as 
communist party doctrine has maintained since 1956 
by printing the ukrainianborn writers short novel forever 
flowing in the soviet union for the first time the monthly 
implicitly questions president mikhail s gorbachevs oftenstated 
view that the nation needs only to shake off the totalitarian 
heritage of stalinism and return to true leninist ways to construct 
a democracy in which the liberty of each citizen is respected 
bolsheviks did not believe in the value of personal freedom 
freedom of speech and press wrote grossman they like lenin 
himself considered those freedoms which were a dream for many 
revolutionary workers and intelligentsia as insignificant 
soviet writers including alexander solzhenitsyn often have used 
the novel form to comment on real issues 
forever flowing was published in frankfurt in 1970 six years 
after grossmans death it apparently circulated earlier in the 
soviet union as part of the genre of underground literature known as 
samizdat 
lenin who steered the bolsheviks to power in the 1917 russian 
revolution was elevated to near divine status by the kremlin 
following his death in 1924 his writings and thought have served 
since as a touchstone and bible for communists gorbachev among them 
the soviet founders preserved body lies in a shrinelike 
mausoleum at the kremlin wall and people lining up daily to wait 
their turn for a glimpse at the remains have worn a path across the 
the cobblestones of red square 
lenins words are cited as gospel by kremlin leaders as well as 
state agencies and propaganda organs the inflight brochures of 
aeroflot the state airline stress lenins enthusiasm for aviation 
in forever flowing grossman portrays a lenin at odds with 
the official heroic portrait a man who may even have had a paunch 
because of a love for buttered macaroni more importantly 
grossmans lenin is a political fanatic who would sooner exterminate 
his enemies than try to persuade them 
lenins intolerance unshakable aspiration to achieve a goal 
contempt for freedom and cruelty to those who thought differently 
his ability to remove from the earth whole regions areas which did 
not comply with his orthodox rightness all those features were not 
added to lenins character by the revolution they go much deeper 
into lenins youth wrote grossman who died in 1964 
lenin didnt try to find the truth in discussions but to 
win grossman said when debates were transferred from the pages 
of newspapers and magazines into the streets battlefields and 
wheatfields it was realized that all cruel means were useful and 
good 
grossmans accusations are strong stuff even given the criticism 
of other soviet historical figures that has appeared under 
gorbachevs campaign for glasnost or more openness in a 
foreword to forever flowing grigory g vodolazov takes issue 
with grossmans identification of lenin with stalin but defends 
grossmans right to write as he pleased 
under socialist pluralism v grossman and those who think 
along his lines have the legal right to express themselves wrote 
vodolazov a member of the editorial board of the party theoretical 
journal problems of peace and socialism the mere existence of 
their opinions their search for answers serve the highest and most 
noble purposes 
if vodolazovs view is now official doctrine it would extend 
glasnosts range beyond the hazy boundaries that so far have 
preserved a measure of immunity for lenin and for gorbachev 
himself since all soviet policy claims to be leninist 
criticizing lenin is casting doubt on the soviet present and past 
since the establishment of soviet power itself 
perhaps grossmans most damning accusation is that lenin paved 
the way for the centralized police state constructed by stalin and 
his nationwide campaigns of political terror that led to the deaths 
of millions 
things inherited from lenin like revolutionary dictatorship 
terror and the struggle against bourgeois freedoms which lenin 
viewed as temporary were used by stalin for building a foundation 
and became a whole with the traditional national lack of 
freedom in russia grossman wrote 
gorbachev other party officials and communist doctrine have 
maintained that stalin was not the heir to lenins work but its 
perverter an article last year in another literary monthly novy 
mir said lenin justified the use of terror and made errors in his 
early economic policy but that he realized he was wrong and thus 
merits praise 
grossmans masterwork a novel about world war ii titled life 
and fate also challenged a central tenet of soviet orthodoxy by 
equating nazism and soviet communism 
the novel was so sensitive that the kgb confiscated grossmans 
manuscript in 1961 along with the carbon paper and typewriter 
ribbons he used to write it like forever flowing life and 
fate was first published in the soviet union by oktyabr

the house agriculture committee was urged 
wednesday not to let the 1990 farm bill wait on the conclusion of 
international trade talks 
the legislation that will shape federal agriculture policy for 
four or five years is in the informationgathering stage and will 
not be crafted for many months said chairman kika de la garza 
dtexas 
during what de la garza described as an open mike session 
members of congress who are not on the committee and two governors 
offered suggestions for the new bill 
north dakota gov george sinner noted the bush administrations 
efforts to abolish export subsidies worldwide during ongoing 
international trade negotiations under the general agreement on 
trade and tariffs or gatt 
earlier agriculture secretary clayton yeutter had even suggested 
that the 1985 farm law be extended until the trade talks are 
finished as they assuredly would affect farm exports 
but sinner opposed tying the legislation to the trade talks 
whatever the outcome of gatt our 1990 farm bill must provide 
strong government support for us agriculture said sinner who 
also is chairman of the national governors association committee on 
agriculture and rural development those policies put in place by 
congress should not be erased by the gatt negotiators 
he said he would like to see export subsidies like the export 
enhancement program used in the united states stopped but only 
multilaterally 
he also called for a solution to the volatile exchange rate 
affecting sales prices 
if there is no other way we should adopt a policy using a 
10year moving average for an exchange rate base and correcting 
deviations from that 10year moving average with a tariff he said 
as for crop reserves sinner questioned whether the united states 
should continue to hold twothirds of the worlds reserves 
the answer is no way said sinner thats one thing gatt 
must work on 
sinner said that the decision in 1985 farm law to freeze program 
payment yields has caused hardship for many young farmers and 
created a land market that is driven by a acreage bases rather than 
the inherent quality of the land 
many young or expanding farmers are suffering from their 
inability to prove yields during the past few years he said it 
is important to allow proving of yields again and to coordinate 
proven yields for federal crop insurance this will make the system 
more equitable 
sinner also said the government needs to figure out what to do 
with the land in the conservation reserve program 
federal agency takeover of lands has gotten out of hand in the 
west at least he said a better privatepublic reward system 
is far more desirable 
kansas gov mike hayden said farmers need more flexibility and 
suggested that the government look at a farmers total acreage of 
all crops in determining how much should be held out for 
conservation purposes 
the us department of agriculture should allow the planting of 
industrial nonfood crops on setaside acres so produces can test 
these crops without being penalized under current farm programs 
he said

attorney general dick thornburgh opposes the 
idea of requiring gun buyers to obtain a national identification 
card one of several options outlined by a justice department task 
force a spokesman said wednesday 
the requirement would be an infringement on rights of 
americans said david runkel adding that the attorney general 
wont recommend that option to president bush 
under the task force suggestion published this week as part of a 
guncontrol study each person who buys a gun would be required to 
first obtain a firearms owners identification card valid for three 
years the study estimated that as many as 5 million cards would be 
issued annually 
an applicant would wait four weeks to six weeks after being 
photographed and fingerprinted while police determine if the 
individual has been convicted of a felony 
thornburgh opposed a similar idea in the 1970s when he headed the 
justice departments criminal division runkel said 
the identificationcard option was one of several ways the task 
force offered to prevent felons from obtaining weapons the task 
force didnt recommend any one of the options it suggested 
the study also noted that criminals would be able to obtain 
weapons on the black market even if an effective screening system 
could be devised 
thornburgh is required by congress to propose a screening system 
by nov 18 but wont review the options until a public comment 
period ends in september runkel said 
another option in the 40page report published monday in the 
federal register would require the nations 270000 gun dealers to 
call local police before selling a weapon to determine if the 
purchaser has a criminal record 
there are an estimated 75 million gun sales each year 
requiring identity cards would force the fbi to hire 1700 
additional clerks to check fingerprints the system would cost 
federal state and local governments 136 million to 161 million a 
year which could be financed by a user fee of 27 to 32 the study 
said 
federal law doesnt require checks of those who want to buy guns 
twenty states as well as the district of columbia require checks 
of the buyers criminal history 
the taskforce study was mandated by congress last year rep 
bill mccollum rfla proposed the measure to head off a bill 
requiring a sevenday waiting period for gun buyers 
mccollums measure was seen by many as an effort by the national 
rifle association to stall gun control by requiring further study

a state judge refused to grant an injunction 
wednesday for parishioners hoping to keep open 14 roman catholic 
churches set to be closed in an effort to consolidate waning 
membership and finances 
the request for the injunction was the latest move in a long 
fight against the closings by bitter parishioners and clergy in the 
15 millionmember archdiocese of detroit 
wayne county circuit judge james a hathaway made the decision 
wednesday saying courts shouldnt settle religious disputes and 
it was jesus idea that we love one another and with a little 
effort we can do that 
outside the wayne county courthouse more than 150 demonstrators 
marched and sang we shall overcome to protest the closings 
this idea of walking around with posters and haranguing each 
other i dont want to see that we need to approach the matter 
from the point of trying to heal differences rather than exacerbate 
them the judge said 
hathaway agreed to consider issuing a temporary stay of cardinal 
edmund szokas order to close the churches to give opponents a 
chance to go to the michigan court of appeals a hearing was 
scheduled for 2 pm thursday 
since january 16 of 30 parishes targeted to be closed have been 
shut down by the archdiocese of detroit including five last 
weekend the closings come under a plan cardinal edmund szoka said 
will strengthen the church by creating fewer parishes 
szoka said the closings became necessary as hundreds of thousands 
of catholics joined the migration to the suburbs of detroit in 
recent decades it left fewer than 50000 catholics in the nations 
sixthlargest city 
detroits population is approximately 11 million about 4 
million people live in the metropolitan area 
five parishes have permission to remain open until july 16 four 
others have longer extensions tied to priests retirements or church 
anniversaries and the rest are to close by friday archdiocese 
spokesman jay berman said tuesday 
robert van cleef an attorney for the 18 churches that are suing 
to stay open argued wednesday that szoka reneged on a promise to 
conduct open grievance hearings before closing parishes 
szokas attorney joseph sullivan said church members wouldnt 
suffer by having their parishes closed until all appeals to the 
vatican are exhausted 
its a little bit difficult for me to understand that 
worshiping at a church a few blocks away or a halfmile or a mile 
from where one used to worship is a serious problem he said 
church members said wednesday they havent lost all hopes of 
saving their parishes 
all i can say is were in good company said leonard gross a 
member of our lady of the rosary david had a lot of opposition 
when he went up against goliath 
berman said the oftenemotional struggle over the closings was a 
painful period that is about to end he expressed hope that detroit 
catholics would begin working to strengthen the church 
its fortunate that this is now being brought to a close 
because we can now focus on the mission which is to revitalize and 
reenergize the church in the city berman said 
last september szoka unveiled a proposal to close or merge 48 of 
112 parishes within the city initially members of most targeted 
parishes opposed the move filing internal appeals with the 
archbishop 
on jan 8 szoka said 30 churches would close this year and 25 
more would have until 1990 to increase membership and improve their 
finances 
last week priests nuns and parishioners from nine parishes said 
they would defy the closing order in several cases they have held 
services outside locked buildings 
but determination to resist the closings began to crumble when 
szoka announced last week that the vatican had rejected appeals 
filed in march by 14 parishes 
opponents of the closings said they may consider filing an appeal 
with the vatican supreme court a move berman said the cardinal

the latest word on abortion law expected in a 
missouri case that has become the most closely watched supreme court 
controversy of the decade may be announced thursday 
and maybe not 
the case webster vs reproductive health services has captured 
enormous attention because the justices are being asked to use it to 
overturn the courts 1973 decision legalizing abortion 
it is one of five cases in which decisions are pending and some 
word must come in each before the 198889 term concludes 
the court last week announced it would release decisions monday 
and thursday this week the assumption and probably still the best 
bet was that thursday would be the courts last day on the bench 
but there is no guarantee when the justices take the bench at 10 
am edt thursday they might not have all five decisions 
court officials could announce that some decisions will be 
released later and the possibility remains that one or more of the 
cases will be ordered held over for reargument in the next term 
which begins in october that could delay announcement of a decision 
until sometime in 1990 
since 1977 the court has ordered at least one case held over for 
reargument each year 
the landmark 1973 ruling in roe vs wade said women have a 
constitutional right based on their right to privacy to abortions 
the decision said a womans decision to have an abortion during 
the first three months of pregnancy must be left to her and her 
doctor it said states may regulate abortions during the second 
trimester only to protect the womans health and may take steps to 
protect fetal life in the third trimester 
state authority to regulate abortions after the first trimester 
was not made absolute however

a japanese manufacturer and texas 
supplier were indicted wednesday on charges of fraud accused of 
supplying substandard nuts and bolts to the defense department and a 
nuclear power plant 
officials said the fasteners were used in civilian trucks 
military vehicles and at the comanche peak nuclear power plant in 
glen rose texas but they said they do not know how many 
substandard parts were used where they were used or how many were 
brought into the country 
government tests found the bolts were weaker than their labeling 
indicated and could break under stress said charles harrison 
assistant special agent in charge of us customs in houston 
its like if someone orders a cadillac and you slap a cadillac 
emblem on a chevrolet and sell it as a cadillac said jim flick 
agent in charge of the defense criminal investigative service in the 
fort worth branch of the inspector generals office 
officials learned about the substandard fasteners 2 years ago 
after a tip 
harrison said there were no reports of injuries resulting from 
failure of substandard nuts and bolts although some of the parts 
were shipped to a peterbilt motors co plant in denton and caused 
minor accidents after being installed in tractortrailer rigs 
brooks griffin senior investigator with the nuclear regulatory 
commission regional office in arlington said several substandard 
bolts had to be replaced in the nuclear power plants residual heat 
removal system which helps cool the reactor core 
griffin declined to speculate what would have happened had the 
plant begun operations with the substandard parts but he said it 
would have been unsafe 
the indictment names yamaguchiseisakusha co ltd of shizuoka 
japan aircom fasteners inc of arlington texas and 11 employees 
of the two companies 
five employees of the japanese company could each face 3 million 
in fines and 78 years imprisonment if convicted harrison said the 
united states will seek their extradition six aircom employees 
could face fines ranging from 750000 to 62 million and prison 
sentences of 15 to 143 years 
if convicted yamaguchiseisakusho faces fines of 3 million on 
counts of fraud mail fraud and entry into the united states of 
falsely labeled goods collins said aircom faces fines of up to 
62 million on numerous fraud counts 
charles blau attorney for aircom president gerald l dunsmore 
said dunsmore and the company are innocent 
dunsmore and four other aircom employees made preliminary court 
appearances wednesday and were released on their personal 
recognizance they are to be arraigned july 7 the sixth person 
indicted did not appear in court 
a woman who answered the phone at aircom said no one at the 
company had any comment she did not give her name 
harrison said customs is investigating at least two other 
suppliers of nuts and bolts in the southwest and more indictments 
are expected within a few months

lastminute efforts to revive a compromise 
aimed at ending the bitter owlsvstrees fight over the ancient 
forests of the northwest collapsed wednesday with most lawmakers 
blaming environmentalists for scuttling the proposal 
after a 45minute joint meeting of the oregon and washington 
state delegations congressmen said they would drop their effort to 
attach the compromise to the house interior appropriations bill 
thursday 
lawmakers added however they would still try to negotiate a 
settlement between environmentalists and the timber industry 
environmentalists who on tuesday rejected the compromise 
proposed at a weekend timber summit said they too were 
willing to continue negotiations and thought the proposal offered 
the framework for a possible solution possibly to attach to the 
bill when the counterpart senate committee takes it up 
oregon democratic rep les aucoin called the decision not to seek 
a legislative solution now a lost opportunity to ensure a 
shortterm supply of logs for northwest mills while protecting the 
oldgrowth forests where the rare northern spotted owl lives 
environmentalists have decided to pursue a strategy that is 
shortsighted politically risky if not plain dumb said aucoin 
i dont think they understand how damned mad the people of the 
northwest will be over the torpedoing of what was a fair equitable 
and balanced proposal 
rep al swift dwash said that environmentalists have been 
able to put a virtual stranglehold on the supply of timber for 
northwest mills by securing court injunctions barring timber sales 
in spotted owl habitat 
the compromise called for harvesting of 8 billion board feet of 
timber from the national forests of the northwest and 1 billion 
board feet from bureau of land management forests in oregon over the 
next 15 months roughly the quantity loggers said they needed to 
keep area mills running though not necessarily in the same places 
the deal also would have ended all court appeals of timber sales 
during the period and would have protected large blocks of old 
growth from fragmentation by logging roads and scattered clearcuts 
environmentalists said they thought the plan was vague and they 
did not have adequate time to consider it they too said they were 
optimistic about an eventual agreement despite the criticism from 
lawmakers 
there is not a level playing field here said swift we 
must appeal to them environmentalists for more flexibility 
fingerpointing isnt going to get anything done said lee 
keller reis a spokeswoman for the national wildlife federation 
we have been willing to talk all along and we are still willing to 
talk 
george frampton jr president of the wilderness society said 
negotiations were far from over and it was just unrealistic 
to expect that a compromise proposed on saturday could be nailed 
down so quickly 
environmentalists have sought to have the spotted owl which 
nests only in the oldgrowth forest of oregon washington and 
northern california protected as a threatened or endangered species 
as part of their campaign to halt logging in the ancient forests 
such a designation for any species requires that its habitat be 
preserved 
the industry has claimed such protection would lock up vast 
sections of the federal forests to logging creating economic 
catastrophe in dozens of onemill towns 
the us fish and wildlife service has proposed the owl for 
listing as a threatened species but a decision might still be two 
years away 
timber industry representatives who had reluctantly accepted the 
compromise said they were not surprised the lawmakers had decided 
not to pursue legislation

a heavy load wind gusts and engine 
problems caused an air force jet to crash and burn on takeoff from a 
texas base killing 19 people said a military report released 
wednesday 
the kc135a tanker crashed jan 31 at dyess air force base near 
abilene texas the refueling plane was carrying a crew from 
michigans sawyer air force base to participate in exercises over 
guam 
the death toll included eight military retirees and family 
members taking advantage of a policy that lets them hop overseas 
flights as space permits two of those killed had just boarded at 
dyess 
the air force isnt limiting the numbers of civilians catching 
such flights because of the crash said maj ken st john a 
spokesman for the 8th air force in barksdale la 
the air force report released wednesday fails to say outright why 
the 26yearold tanker swerved suddenly into the ground as it took 
off from dyess 
the report notes the possible failure of a waterinjection system 
designed to give the jet extra liftoff power and mentions that the 
heavily loaded plane was struggling to take off under gusting winds 
there wasnt anything black and white st john said the 
team believes a combination of factors was involved 
st john said the investigating team blamed the crash on the 
combined effect of the gusting wind the planes full weight and its 
failing waterinjection system he said witnesses also told 
investigators the craft took off at too steep an angle which also 
would have cut its liftoff power 
repair records showed the crafts waterinjection system had 
failed eight times from october to december maintenance crews 
replaced one engine and believed they had the problem fixed st 
john said 
those kinds of malfunctions are not unusual he said it is 
a recurrent problem with the kc135a 
the crash was the second at dyess in less than three months and 
third in three months involving a plane from sawyer a nuclear base 
by lake superior 
six people died oct 11 when another plane from sawyer crashed 
during landing at wurtsmith air force base in eastern lower 
michigan pilot inexperience was cited as a factor 
a broken fuel pump overheated and sparked the dec 6 explosion of 
a b52 bomber during toucandgo landings at sawyer all eight crew 
members survived in what base personnel called a miracle

against the advice of its chairman the house 
armed services committee voted wednesday to restore funds to the 
295 billion defense budget to save a marine aircraft and f14d 
fighter jet the bush administration wants to cancel 
in a vote marked by high drama the democraticcontrolled panel 
tied 26all on an amendment to accept the 64 billion procurement 
budget without any addons or deletion 
reps patricia schroeder dcolo and ron dellums dcalif 
initially passed during the roll call but then cast no votes 
that resulted in a tie and the amendments failure 
by virtue of the measures defeat two other amendments saving 
the marine corps v22 osprey and the navys f14d tomcat fighter 
and providing about 1 billion for the national guard and reserves 
by reducing funds for the b2 stealth bomber were adopted as part 
of the procurement budget 
in a final vote the committee sent the bill to the full house 
445 
individual amendments to cancel the b2 program outright cut all 
funds to move 50 mx missiles from silos to railroad cars and reduce 
b2 spending by 379 million to buy army ammunition were defeated 
approved and made part of the procurement budget was an amendment 
introduced by reps curt weldon rpa and thomas foglietta dpa 
that would provide 157 million in the 1990 fiscal year beginning 
oct 1 for the bellboeing v22 to be built in fort worth texas 
and which defense secretary dick cheney wants to cancel 
the f14d fighter which is manufactured by grumman corp on 
long island would receive 230 million 
the amendment backed by rep sonny montgomery dmiss would 
take 500 million from the b2 bomber and about 520 million from 
spare parts for the national guard and reserves 
the committee chairman rep les aspin dwis had urged his 
colleagues to accept the procurement budget as presented last week 
in a 109 vote the procurement subcommittee had responded 
positively to aspins call 
but members expressed dismay with aspins schedule for voting on 
the amendments which even if approved would be negated if the panel 
in its last decision accepted cheneys 64 billion procurement 
budget 
its like going to a dance by yourself you get to dance with 
all the girls but at the end you get to pick only one to take 
home said rep arthur ravenel jr rsc 
nevertheless the panel voted on five individual amendments 
before deciding against cheneys budget 
by a vote of 3616 the panel rejected an amendment introduced by 
dellums to cancel the b2 bomber which at between 500 million and 
650 million a copy is considered the most expensive plane in 
history 
its time to cut loose from the monument to misallocated 
money dellums argued weve obligated ourselves to 22 billion 
without knowing whether this plane can fly 
rep john kasich rohio who backed the amendment noted that 
every week the air force changes the mission for the radarevading 
plane 
another b2 opponent rep john rowland rconn reminded his 
colleagues that based on the newly declassified cost figures 
released by the pentagon it was likely that congress would use the 
proposed 5 billion in fiscal 1991 for the b2 as a cash cow 
but aspin argued that a vote on the b2 will take place on the 
house floor and total termination at this point is wrong 
the panel also rejected dellums amendment to stop 164 million 
requested by the pentagon to move 50 mx missiles from silos to 
railroad cars the vote was 4210 
the panel did approve a reports language that transferred money 
from b2 procurement to research and development on the stealth 
bomber a day earlier the panel rejected an amendment to restore 
351 million for the bomber that the research and development 
subcommittee voted to spend on the osprey 
that vote left 27 billion in procurement funds for the b2 and 
cut the proposed 18 billion for research and development to about 
15 billion 
in its first work of the day the committee beat back efforts to 
provide money at the expense of the stealth bomber for buying the 
v22 a revolutionary aircraft that would take off like a helicopter 
but fly like an airplane 
in the two votes the committee 
rejected by voice vote an amendment by rep john spratt dsc 
that would have cut funds for the b2 by 850 million and allocated 
157 million for the osprey contingent on cheneys reevaluation of 
the aircraft 
rejected 3121 an amendment by rep marvin leath dtexas to 
reduce b2 money by 900 million and restore 157 million for the 
osprey without any restrictions 
aspin said wednesday of the procurement budget i support dick 
cheneys budget not because its dick cheneys i played with 
the amendments and i didnt come up with anything better than what 
cheney had 
the committee also approved an additional 300 million for the 
department of energy to clean up toxic and radioactive wastes at 
nuclear weapons sites 
and the panel accepted an amendment requiring the bush 
administration to certify that safety standards for the withdrawal 
of chemical stockpiles in europe be met before certain money could 
be spent 
both measures were approved by voice vote 
late tuesday the panel agreed to reduce the number of troops 
stationed in europe in connection with the ussoviet 
intermediaterange nuclear forces treaty by 15000 
star wars formally known as the strategic defense initiative 
took a 11 billion cut as the committee by voice vote approved a 
35 billion budget considerably less than the 46 billion bush 
proposed for the program to develop lasers and other weapons to stop 
enemy nuclear missiles 
that reduction came on top of a 1 billion cut in proposed star 
wars spending made by cheney two months ago as he slashed 10 
billion from the budget

the house wednesday rejected an effort to 
attach strings to us aid to el salvador as it worked toward 
completion of a 23 billion twoyear foreign aid bill 
lawmakers voted 233185 to kill an amendment by rep matthew 
mchugh dny that would have held back 34 million in military 
aid to el salvador next year until congress had a chance to review 
how the rightwing ruling arena party is handling human rights 
mchugh argued that the amendment backed primarily by democrats 
would keep pressure on newly elected arena president alfredo 
cristiani to curb rightwing death squads and work toward a peaceful 
settlement of a civil war with leftist rebels 
without some chance to review the aid totaling 170 million 
over the life of the bill congress would be giving cristiani a 
blank check for two years he said 
but opponents noted that the bill already gives congress a chance 
to vote down further aid next april if it finds serious human rights 
abuses and accused democrats of harboring grudges left over from 
tensions over central america with the reagan administration 
rep henry hyde arguing against the proposal noted that the 
fmln guerillas have been accused of numerous recent murders of 
civilians including cristianis chief of staff the fmln has 
never been more brutal in its tactics hyde said why in the 
world would you want to coddle these people 
consideration of the measure was expected to extend into 
thursday when the house was to take up an amendment imposing a 
series of new sanctions against china for its deadly crackdown on 
prodemocracy demonstrators 
rep stephen solarz dny said the list would include 
suspending trade and development programs banning the sale of 
policerelated weapons and limiting transfer of hightechnology 
items 
i think it sends a very strong signal to the leaders and people 
of china that the united states will not continue business as usual 
in the absence of fundamental human rights improvement solarz 
said 
the bill authorizes the spending of up to 115 billion each in 
fiscal 1990 and 1991 for the entire range of us foreign aid 
programs including military support economic subsidies and 
development aid for friendly countries around the world 
the measure perenially one of the most politically unpopular to 
come before congress still faces an uphill fight no separate 
foreign aid bill has been enacted since 1985 each years aid since 
then has been taken care of in annual spending bills 
this year the senate foreign relations committee has had a 
particularly hard time grappling with its version prompting 
chairman claiborne pell dri to observe that there is a 
profound lack of interest in the measure in addition the bush 
administration has threatened a veto over provisions it says 
unfairly limit the presidents foreign policy latitude 
as they worked through a deep pile of amendments to the bill the 
lawmakers also 
rejected 212204 a proposal to force random drug testing for 
state department employees and others involved in administering 
foreign aid programs 
earmarked 75 million in each of the two years of the bill for 
humanitarian aid for the people of lebanon to be administered 
through international aid agencies 
approved a nonbinding amendment stating that election law 
reforms undertaken by the leftwing sandinista government in 
nicaragua do not meet the requirement of a regional peace accord

leona helmsley cried in court wednesday when her 
lawyer argued she could not get a fair trial unless he was allowed 
to show that one of her codefendants had stolen money from helmsley 
businesses 
this isnt going to be a trial its going to be a farce 
said her lawyer gerald feffer 
mrs helmsley who sat facing us district judge john walker 
jr used her hands to wipe away tears that fell down her face a 
judges clerk later brought her a handful of tissues 
the arguments came late in the afternoon after walker completed 
three days of screening potential jurors for the tax evasion trial 
of mrs helmsley and two former aides 
feffer asked the judge for broad latitude in presenting evidence 
crossexamining witnesses and arguing in his opening and closing 
statements that codefendant frank j turco an exsenior officer 
with helmsley hotels had engaged in wholesale theft from the 
helmsleys 
its an essential part of our defense he said 
turcos attorney william brodsky argued a separate motion 
asking that his client be severed from the trial because mrs 
helmsleys defense would be prejudicial and deny him a fair trial 
i think it would be devastating for mr turco to have two sides 
attacking him with artillery brodsky said referring to assistant 
us attorney james davita and feffer 
walker reserved decision on both motions 
feffer claimed he had evidence that showed turco had siphoned 
large amounts of money and deposited it into his personal bank 
accounts 
one charge in the indictment alleged that mrs helmsley had 
instructed employees through turco to submit phony travel vouchers 
and then give her the cash feffer said he alleged that turco had 
kept the money and that it was not passed on to mrs helmsley 
mrs helmsley 68 who with her husband heads a 5 billion real 
estate and hotel empire is charged with conspiracy tax and fraud 
charges in connection with the billing of more than 4 million in 
personal expenses to helmsleycontrolled companies 
among the expenses prosecutors allege were wrongfully reported 
were renovations including the installation of a marble dance 
floor at the couples mansion in greenwich conn 
two former aides turco and joseph licari are charged with 
assisting in the scheme mrs helmsleys 80yearold husband harry 
was indicted but removed from the trial for health reasons 
mrs helmsley and turco also are charged with extortion for 
allegedly shaking down employees and contractors doing business with 
the helmsley companies 
walker completed choosing a pool of 60 potential jurors on 
wednesday before opening arguments lawyers and prosecutors will 
select the 12 jurors and six alternates who will serve

a fraud case against northrop corp now 
includes allegations the defense contractor sold the government 
about 200 improperly tested guidance systems for missiles and 
planes rather than 17 
the amended indictment filed tuesday in us district court by 
the us attorneys office adds 22 counts to a 167count indictment 
filed april 11 
the company was charged with conspiracy and lying to the 
government in the testing and sale of stabilization devices used in 
nucleartipped cruise missiles and the marines av8b harrier jets 
northrop spokesman tony cantafio repeated the companys position 
that there had been no wrongdoing 
the government alleges the company sold devices called flight 
data transmitters and costing 4000 to 6000 apiece that had 
failed tests to show they would work at temperatures as low as 65 
degrees below zero 
contracts required that test because the gyroscopic devices must 
work in the cold encountered at high altitudes 
the original indictment alleged 17 of more than 1000 of the 
units sold from 1984 through 1989 had been improperly tested the 
amended indictment says 200 werent properly tested 
northrop which makes the flight data transmitters at its pomona 
plant could be fined up to 30 million if convicted

the governing national party will 
campaign in parliamentary elections this year on a platform 
envisioning a direct vote for blacks in national affairs within five 
years according to party leaders 
the platform to be adopted thursday at a party congress in 
pretoria includes removal of criminal penalties for residential 
apartheid violations more government subsidies for multiracial 
schools removal of race as the major criterion for identifying 
political groups a bill of rights and negotiating a new 
constitution with black leaders 
much of the platform represents a softening of nationalist 
policies aimed at maintaining white control 
in london a leader of the outlawed african national congress 
guerrilla group called it an advance but from a wrong position 
its a step forward to the extent that the national party 
recognizes that south africa cannot be ruled on the basis of 
exclusive power for the white minority said thabo mbeki 
secretary for international affairs en route to the ancs base in 
lusaka zambia 
but the position is wrong because it continues to define people 
as black and white and not as the people of south africa the period 
of transition must emerge from negotiations 
information minister stoffel van der merwe outlined the platform 
at a news briefing 
the fiveyear plan does not specifically say blacks could vote 
directly for national representatives within five years but van der 
merwe and finance minister barend du plessis said that was what it 
foresees 
the platform appears consistent with the nationalists declared 
goal of providing blacks with a national political voice in a way 
that would preserve rights for the whites and other minorities 
black activists seek a oneman onevote system that would 
effectively transfer power to the black majority 
the platform is believed to reflect the thinking of national 
party leader fw de klerk designated successor to president pw 
botha who says he will retire after elections sept 6 
the plan begins with the statement south africa is one 
undivided state with one citizenship for all every south african 
has the right to participate in political decisionmaking on all 
levels of government which affect his interests subject to the 
principle of no domination 
van der merwe said that to keep the 5 million whites from being 
dominated by the 28 million blacks government officials 
contemplated forming something like the un security council in 
which major powers have a veto on some issues but not all 
specifics are to be negotiated with recognized leaders of all 
groups committed to the pursuit of peaceful solutions the plan 
says 
bothas government has been accused of jailing and silencing 
legitimate black leaders while seeking to negotiate with those who 
have no constituency 
van der merwe said the nationalists would modify their demand 
that black negotiators renounce violence and require only that they 
be committed to peaceful solutions 
the demand for renunciation of violence has been seen as an 
obstacle to talks with the anc which conducts guerrilla attacks in 
south africa but says it also seeks peaceful solutions 
groups their identities and their rights still are a major part 
of the nationalist manifesto but van der merwe said the plan calls 
for a shift from the present racedefined groups to culturally 
defined groups for political purposes and for people in groups 
not the government to decide who can join 
he said this means that eventually the population registration 
act a cornerstone law of apartheid would cease to be required 
the act classifies south africans racially for purposes of housing 
education medical treatment military service political rights 
and access to public amenities 
the nationalists remain committed to racially segregated schools 
for those who prefer them but the platform commits the party to 
providing a system of subsidized private schools for those who 
prefer to live outside a specific group context 
the government already subsidizes some private multiracial 
schools van der merwe and du plessis said the plan envisages 
expanding the subsidies eventually there would be a dual 
educational system racially segregated public schools and 
multiracial private schools both funded by the government 
the group areas act another pillar of apartheid will remain on 
the books meaning it will still be a crime to live in a 
neighborhood designated for another race but the party plan calls 
for a system of assistance and negotiation to solve the 
problem without legal intervention

a federal judge wednesday ordered a special federal 
grand jury impaneled to investigate alleged criminal activity at

judge sherman finesilver said a special one should be called aug 1 
because there is a possibility of a lengthy investigation 
fbi and environmental protection agency investigators raided 
rocky flats 16 miles northwest of denver on june 6 looking for 
evidence of criminal environmental violations including illegal 
disposal of hazardous wastes 
the department of energy plant is operated by rockwell

secretary james watkins allowing colorado to more closely monitor 
rocky flats hailed the decision to call a special grand jury 
i welcome anything that helps get the complete facts on the 
table we need to remove the mystery about rocky flats and i think a 
grand jury will help accomplish that i want all of the truth to 
come out he said 
three days after federal investigators raided rocky flats a 
federal judge unsealed the fbi affidavit that led to the search 
warrant at the plant 
the affidavit alleged that plant workers burned hazardous wastes 
illegally in a plutonium reprocessing building that had been closed 
for safety violations 
it also says the plant illegally discharged pollutants into two 
creeks that flow into water supplies serving four denver suburbs 
and illegally dumped hazardous wastes documents allegedly were 
falsified to cover up the acts the affidavit said

grenadas former police commissioner 
went on a shooting rampage at police headquarters wednesday killing 
the commissioner and a us diplomat and wounding two highranking 
officers an official said 
in washington the state department said the american died trying 
to subdue the gunman who was later killed by other law officers 
the shooting occurred at 1130 am at fort george the police 
headquarters which overlooks st georges harbor 
the state department and officials in grenada said the slain 
diplomat john angelo butler 33 of twentynine palms calif the 
political officer at the us embassy was not the original target 
police commissioner cosmus raymond also was killed officials said 
daniel searles the acting police superintendent and collis 
barrow deputy police commissioner were wounded and taken to st 
georges general hospital deputy prime minister ben jones said 
both were listed in stable condition 
officials identified the attacker as grafton bascombe his motive 
was not known 
state department press officer dennis harter said in washington 
his department understood bascombe was on loan to the neighboring 
caribbean island of st vincent and had been about to return there 
albert xavier an adviser to prime minister herbert blaize said 
bascombes return was delayed because he was in charge of funds made 
available for joint military exercises with the united states and 
was to have given an accounting to raymond on wednesday 
xavier said bascombe entered raymonds office and fired two shots 
from a 45caliber revolver hitting the commissioner in the head 
and stomach and killing him instantly 
bascombe next walked into barrows office next door where us 
embassy and police officials were meeting butler and administrative 
officer roy sullivan were representing the embassy 
harter reported they were discussing administrative details 
connected with the recently concluded operation trade winds joint 
military exercises held in grenada last week 
they were also discussing security plans for the fourth of july 
reception scheduled to be held at the american embassy according to 
eyewitness accounts bascombe burst into the room fired 
several shots critically wounding barrow and searles 
john butler made a move to subdue the assailant who then shot 
mr butler pointblank before fleeing the room 
mr butler apparently was killed instantly 
we cant speculate on bascombes motives but we have 
no indication that mr butler was a deliberate target of the killer 
this does not appear to have been an act of political terrorism 
according to xavier bascombe fired first at barrow hitting him 
in the thigh and then at searles hitting him in both legs 
xavier said butler was shot fatally in the stomach he said 
sullivan was not hurt 
harter said the californiaborn butler had been assigned in 
grenada as political officer since the summer of 1988 
butler joined the foreign service in 1980 and served in the 
dominican republic and costa rica harter said butler was a 
graduate of the university of san diego and had a graduate degree 
from san diego state he leaves his wife and a stepchild both of 
whom were in grenada 
after the attack bascombe reportedly walked onto the veranda of 
the police station threw his revolver and police cap into the yard 
below then put his hands above his head and ran down the hill 
xavier said 
one witness said however that bascombe was apprehended by 
police in the station yard and dragged to a police building a 
doctor who examined bascombe said he found him handcuffed lying on 
the floor and bleeding from a facial wound xavier said 
harter said the department had no details of how bascombe was 
killed 
grenada is an island of about 100000 people in the caribbean 
in october 1983 us marines and paratroopers along with a 
small caribbean force invaded the island and toppled a marxist 
junta that had seized power

thousands of gold prospectors in the 
amazon are devastating rain forests and killing off the worlds 
largest primitive indian tribe a panel of officials scientists and 
clerics said wednesday 
indian reservations are being physically morally and 
culturally destroyed by uncontrolled gold mining and settlement in 
the region said action for the citizens 
it is the first time government officials have spoken against 
destruction of the yanomami indian tribe and the rain forest by gold 
miners in this nation where the frontier spirit is strong and 
rugged prospectors are widely seen as folk heroes the government 
has rarely intervened 
the commission of justice ministry officials lawmakers lawyers 
scientists roman catholic church members and missionaries said 
whites disrupted indian hunting contaminated rivers with mercury 
used to join gold dust particles and spread fatal diseases among the 
indian population 
the yanomamis are a tribe of about 9000 in the far northern 
states of amazonas and roraima near the venezuelan border the area 
is rich in timber gold diamonds and other minerals and has been 
invaded by an estimated 100000 prospectors despite a government 
ban prohibiting whites from entering indian reservations 
owing to the tolerance of the authorities before an invasion of 
thousands of gold miners into the reserves we are seeing the 
genocide of the yanomani indians devastation of nature 
contamination of rivers and a gigantic ecological disaster sen 
severo gomes of the centrist brazilian democratic movement party 
said in an interview 
gomes had joined house member plinio arruda sampaio of the 
leftist workers party archbishop aldo mongiano and 15 other 
members in a recent threeday trip to several yanomami reservations 
in the faroff jungle state of roraima some 3720 miles northwest 
of rio de janeiro 
the delegation also visited territories of the macuxi wapixana 
ingarico and taurepang tribes which have been invaded by ranchers 
that burned off and cleared indigenous farmland 
the 26page report denounced a complete disregard for the law 
by the miners and the lack of government enforcement in the region 
which it said even led to contrabanding of gold 
all gold is required by law to be sold to the government 
the miners themselves with their guns resolve all legal 
problems said senator gomes 
prospectors illegally used jungle airstrips cut by the brazilian 
air force every five minutes to transport cargo and manpower by 
helicopter and planes said sampaio 
the whole thing looks like vietnam during the war he said 
the hellish noise of planes and helicopters sends the indians 
scattering 
last year the powerful bishops council of the roman catholic 
church warned that the yanomamis faced extinction if their lands 
were taken away the council said the government reduced by 70 
percent the tribes 173 million acres of land divided into 19 
separate tracts 
about 220000 indians are left in brazil down from an estimated 
5 million when the country was discovered by the portuguese in 1500

home and eat carrot cake he said

r foster winans the former wall street journal 
reporter convicted in an insider trading scandal has gone to court 
to keep the state crime victims board from confiscating his book 
royalties 
the board is using the states son of sam law to try to get 
17000 in royalties that winans publisher owes him on his book 
trading secrets seduction and scandal at the wall street 
journal 
the law named for socalled son of sam killer david 
berkowitz was passed to keep convicted criminals from profiting 
from their crimes 
winans 40 seeking a hearing wednesday argued in papers filed 
in triallevel state supreme court that he was convicted of federal 
crimes and therefore state laws do not apply and state agencies have 
no jurisdiction in his case 
he also raised a first amendment free speech issue saying the 
law cannot possibly be applied to a professional writer since the 
law would then prevent me from pursuing my only occupation 
winans 1985 conviction on 49 counts of conspiracy and fraud 
stemmed from a scheme in which he passed information from the wall 
street journal column heard on the street which he cowrote 
to stock brokers before it was published the brokers used the 
information to profit in stock trading 
winans 18month sentence was reduced on appeal to one year and 
he was ordered to pay 5000 to a federal crime victims fund 
in august 1986 st martins press published winans book about 
his experience his contracts called for advances of 35000 for 
hardcover rights and 30000 for the paperback rights 
on jan 14 1987 the state crime victims board moved to get the 
1706554 st martins had not yet paid winans meanwhile federal 
authorities claimed their 5000 and winans paid them with money he 
already had 
in his suit to collect the money his book has earned winans also 
argued 
the son of sam law is unconstitutional because it calls for 
seizure of property without due process 
the federal crime victims law requires there be physical harm 
to a victim and federal authorities have a victims reimbursement 
fund which he paid into 
that while state law was amended in 1985 to cover federal 
crimes his crimes occurred in 198384 before the law was passed and 
the law may not be applied retroactively 
that he was convicted of stealing information from his 
employers dow jones amp co owners of the wall street journal and 
that a probation report says his former employers not asking for any 
monetary recovery

an agreement to abandon the beleaguered 
shoreham nuclear power plant cleared its final hurdle wednesday when 
long island lighting co shareholders overwhelmingly approved the 
deal 
we must now come together and end the controversy chairman 
william catacosinos told about 600 shareholders at the utilitys 
annual meeting its hurt all of us too much 
gov mario cuomo who helped negotiate the deal said the 
shareholders approval allows lilco to devote itself exclusively 
in the future to providing safe and reliable energy for long island 
at the lowest possible cost 
the shareholders also approved the terms of a settlement of a 
classaction lawsuit filed against the utility under the racketeer 
influenced and corrupt organizations act it calls for long island 
lighting to refund 390 million to ratepayers as adjustments in 
monthly bills over a 10year period 
the shareholders approval was the final step necessary before 
the settlement between the company and the state to close the 55 
billion shoreham plant can take effect 
the utility is expected to seek permission from the federal 
nuclear regulatory commission to sell shoreham for 1 to the long 
island power authority a state agency the agency will then seek 
approval from the nrc to dismantle the plant 
the company was not guaranteed any rate increases in exchange for 
agreeing to sell the plant cuomo predicted when the deal was 
announced that any hikes would be probably less than 45 percent a 
year the utilitys customers already pay among the highest electric 
rates in the nation 
state and local officials contend the area around the plant 
about 50 miles east of new york city could not be safely evacuated 
in the event of an accident 
it would be the first time a completed nuclear power plant will 
be closed without ever going on line 
a preliminary tally of about 85 percent of shareholders indicated 
that shareholders voted approximately 82 million to 3 million to 
accept the deal company spokesman james lois said 
still the deal could lead to a new round of battles since 
federal energy department officials have stated they intend to block 
the sale and transfer of shoreham for dismantling 
they contend the reactor should be mothballed so that it could be 
activated if necessary to meet energy needs in the future

fire had blackened 1000 acres since it was spotted shortly before 2 
pm wednesday 
another blaze just east of lake elsinore charred 4000 acres of 
thick mountain brush and jumped containment lines in two areas 
forcing authorities to order evacuation of an estimated 200 families 
shifting afternoon winds complicated firefighting efforts in the 
larger blaze which started tuesday in the cleveland national forest 
its really picked up in its velocity said joanne evans a 
california division of forestry spokeswoman its rapidly burning 
in a couple of canyons 
in southwestern new mexico firefighters were mopping up a 
wildfire that burned 11770 acres of ponderosa pine trees grass and 
brush in the gila national forest a us forest service official 
said 
another fire that burned 25000 acres 23 miles southeast of 
animas was controlled said ron henderson fire information officer 
firefighters were released from the gray ranch fire which burned 
mainly grass and some ponderosa pine pinon and juniper trees on 
private land in hidalgo county henderson said 
both fires were triggered by lightning june 15 
the smaller fire 20 miles northeast of silver city in a rugged 
are of the parched gila was contained at 6 pm wednesday 
henderson said 
things are cool and calm he said were trying to unwind 
that fire as fast as we can now people are tired and dirty 
in california the fire east of lake elsinore threatened decker 
canyon and the rancho capistrano area red cross workers set up at 
elsinore high school to take care of people who fled 
the fires are coming down those hills there but im not sure 
how far they are evans said 
the blaze was 35 percent controlled and officials hoped cooler 
temperatures and light winds would help firefighters 
the later fire in the angeles national forest blackened 1000 
acres of brush and was burning out of control prompting the 
evacuation of green valley leona valley and elizabeth lake said

40 feet in height

downtown los angeles aided by four aerial tankers and two 
helicopters 
the larger fire which began tuesday stretched along a 20mile 
front in the mountains about 10 miles east of lake elsinore and drew 
to within a quartermile of about 175 small ranches at one point 
said us forest service spokesman nelson dean said 
reinforcements were called in wednesday to the fire which 
earlier had forced evacuation of a youth correctional facility and a 
nudist camp 
west winds were light and temperatures were in the 70s but the 
fire continued to feed on parched vegetation 
the blaze roaring through brush and chaparral dried by three 
years of drought was apparently caused by man but dean said 
investigators had not determined if it was deliberately set

the leader of namibias main guerrilla organization 
wednesday accused south africa of using murder and terror to 
sabotage the namibian peace process and november independence 
elections 
sam nujoma president of the south west africa peoples 
organization said pretoria was waging a campaign against the 
namibian people despite the move towards free elections overseen by 
the united nations 
nujoma said special south african police units known as koevoets 
meaning crowbar in afrikaans were murdering and terrorizing the 
black population and destroying crops 
un secretarygeneral javier perez de cuellar is reported to 
have told a closed meeting of the security council on tuesday that 
actions by koevoet members raised grave doubts about the possibility 
of free and fair elections in namibia 
in windhoek on wednesday louis pienaar the south african 
administrator of the territory said he would be happy to discuss 
the presence of the koevoet units in the namibian security forces 
with perez de cuellar 
nujoma who intends to end his exile from namibia soon also 
criticized south african moves to raise the age for voters from 18 
to 21 he said that might reduce swapos support by 30 percent 
though swapo is expected to win a majority in the elections it 
is not certain they will receive the twothirds majority needed to 
control the government 
swapo has been engaged in a bush war against south african rule 
of namibia since 1966 
nujoma also hinted that an independent namibia could join the 
commonwealth the 48nation association of britain and its former 
colonies he said the matter was raised at the meeting 
asked whether swapo would want the country to join nujoma 
replied perhaps it would be a good idea for us to be in the 
commonwealth we will look into that 
namibia gained independence from south africa under a 
unsponsored peace plan that included the withdrawal of 50000 
cuban troops from angola but the peace process almost foundered the 
day it began on april 1 when more than 1000 swapo guerrillas 
crossed over the boarder from angola into namibia in violation of 
the regional peace agreement 
more than 300 guerrillas and 27 securityforce members were 
killed in subsequent fighting but clashes have stopped and the 
election campaign begins in july independence is expected to come 
early next year 
the un has sponsored an airlift to repatriate 41000 registered 
namibian refugees in time for the opening of the campaign but so 
far only 10200 have been returned

the last temptation of christ is 
being introduced to video stores with as little fanfare as possible 
thursday to avoid tempting the virulent protests that met its 
theatrical debut producers said 
mca home video fearful that the movies video release might 
encourage further demonstrations and boycotts is distributing the 
last temptation without store displays promotional posters or 
advertising 
so far there have been no organized demonstrations against the 
video even so the last temptation at a suggested retail price 
of 8995 will not be sold by blockbuster video the nations 
largest videostore chain 
its certainly unusual but it was a corporate decision 
considering all that went on with the film said wally knief a 
spokesman for the fort lauderdalebased video chain with 343 
companyowned outlets nationwide 
it is blockbusters first such action against a major studio 
release knief said and nearly 80 percent of blockbusters 387 
franchise locations also have indicated they wont carry the video 
robert blattner president of mca home video which is affiliated 
with last temptation producer universal pictures said his 
company was taking a lowkey marketing approach because it was 
conscious of provoking a new controversy which was clearly not in 
anybodys interest 
on the other hand were not willing to keep it on the shelf 
blattner said we think its important that this title be made 
available in the marketplace 
starring willem dafoe and directed by martin scorsese the last 
temptation was attacked before it appeared in theaters last august 
by many fundamentalist christian organizations most objected to the 
depiction of christ as a doubting messiah with human frailties and 
sexual fantasies 
a secretary for the rev donald wildmon a conservative christian 
activist who led those attacks said wednesday that wildmon was not 
planning any protests against the videocassette debut as he had 
threatened to do last year 
a number of independent stores also will not carry the cassette 
john clark owner of the video center in gilroy calif said 
although he carries xrated videos that could be considered 
controversial he would not bring in the last temptation for 
that very reason 
i just dont need the potential of the community being upset 
clark said clark said he has a separate room for the sexually 
explicit movies and that he was not willing to build another room 
just for the last temptation 
employees of national video retailer music plus which will carry 
the last temptation have been told to tell patrons that the 
chain does not have the right to censor its product line because it 
would not serve customer needs 
although the films opening was greeted with pickets and 
vandalism the last temptation was a modest hit it has grossed 
82 million to date according to exhibitor relations co and won 
an academy award nomination for director scorsese 
mca home video declined to say how many cassettes of the last 
temptation it was producing but the trade magazine video week 
estimated that 47000 units will be shipped

president bush revisiting an issue that drew 
public outrage earlier this year will call for a pay raise for 
congress and the abolition of fees for members outside speeches 
but will not make specific proposals administration officials said 
wednesday 
bushs proposal for salary increases for members of congress as 
well as top government officials will be included a speech thursday 
in which he will unveil proposals for tougher campaign finance laws 
said the officials who spoke on condition of anonymity 
bush aides played down the salary increase which bush has 
previously advocated as a side issue to the packet of proposals 
designed to limit special interest influence in elections 
the white house initially planned to advance the idea of a 
gradual pay increase tied to a phaseout of honoraria the fees 
members of congress earn from speeches said one source but the 
president decided wednesday to leave such specifics out of his 
speech another top official said 
hell make a point that he thinks honoraria and pay raises 
should be linked and he will offer to work with congress to put 
together a deal the first official said 
bush also decided not to propose a specific pay increase for 
congress to go along with the 25 percent raise he already is seeking 
for federal judges however he was expected to give a number in his 
call to raise top officials salaries in the executive branch 
a proposed 51 percent pay raise for congress government 
officials and judges went down in flames earlier this year in a 
backlash of public resentment that raise would have increased 
congressional salaries from 89500 a year to 135000 
bush aides noted a proposal this month by sen christopher dodd 
dconn that would increase salaries for members of congress top 
executive branch officials and the judiciary by 10 percent per year 
for four years at the same time honoraria for lawmakers would be 
phased out 
congressmen currently augment their salaries with thousands of 
dollars in speaking fees a practice criticized as an invitation to 
influencebuying they may get 2000 per speech up to 30 percent 
of salary in the house and 40 percent in the senate 
rep vic fazio dcalif cochairman of a house task force 
already studying honoraria and other ethics issues said bushs 
input was welcome but he doubted congress would quickly embrace 
whatever he proposes 
we appreciate his willingness to get into these issues but 
weve got to solve these matters internally he said 
fazio said his group hoped to finish drafting a new ethics 
package this year and pay raise or not it will be a tough sell 
its a lot easier to vote no and deal with the devil you 
know he said 
the speech thursday will outline the presidents proposals for 
election law changes that package according to those working on 
it will include the abolition of business and labor political 
action committees a ban on carrying over campaign funds from one 
election to the next curtailment of gerrymandering methods of 
drawing political district lines and full disclosure of socalled 
soft money contributions to campaigns 
soft money is a term used to describe funds that are raised 
outside the guidelines of federal election law and that do not have 
to be reported to the federal election commission the frequently 
cited example is that of corporate and union funds barred in 
federal campaigns that are given to political parties or state 
groups which then help the candidates even though they are formally 
independent of the campaign committees 
bush also will call for restrictions on franking privileges 
which allow members of congress to send mail to their constituents 
free 
bush has been meeting in recent weeks with members of congress 
advocacy groups and campaign law specialists to address concerns 
that special interest money plays too big a role in politics 
advocates of campaign changes said the president efforts wouldnt 
go far enough to make a difference 
ellen miller who heads the nonprofit center for responsive 
politics said disclosing the sources of money will not eliminate 
special interest influence but she said the very fact that he is 
in this ball game that he is clearly personally concerned and 
committed to change and reform in this area is a major step 
fred wertheimer president of common cause a longtime advocate 
of tougher election laws said that from what he knows of bushs 
proposals they do not solve the problems of massive campaign 
spending and specialinterest influence 
he also said that bushs plan to bar corporate and union pacs but 
allow political action committees that are not tied to companies 
unions or trade associations would leave room for continued abuse 
but he said if bushs action leads to bipartisan congressional 
negotiations this could mean an enormous difference in breaking 
this whole thing open 
wertheimer and miller were invited to the white house on tuesday 
to talk with bush and his advisers about revamping the campaign 
finance system 
on the pay raise bush has said he wanted to distinguish the 
congressional pay raise quagmire from salary increases for judges 
and executive branch officials 
in april bush endorsed a 25 percent pay increase for federal 
judges which is pending in congress 
at a news conference on tuesday bush was asked about his concern 
that many people have left government service for higher paying 
private jobs 
i want to see that remedied he said i still would like to 
see the separation of consideration for judges and other key 
executive branch posts im thinking of some of the researchers in 
the nih the national institutes of health and people of this 
nature and i want to see it separated out so it doesnt get caught 
on the question of congressional pay 
bush endorsed the 51percent salary increase for congress 
executive branch officials and judges in january at his first news 
conference

made 
gov gaston caperton who has tried to bring pittston and the 
united mine workers together for talks reiterated that state police 
would investigate all reported violence and make arrests when

the use of criminal activity by either side of the conflict in 
our coal field is an intolerable response to labormanagement 
problems he said

additional 6000 had been on strike but it was unclear if they had 
returned to work or were on vacation the miners staggered twoweek

violate the contract the union signed in february 1988 with the 
bituminous coal operators association the bcoa represents most 
major coal operators but not pittston 
the union hasnt sanctioned the strikes and we will do

president roh taewoo said wednesday he 
firmly opposes demands by us lawmakers and some of his countrymen 
to reduce the number of us troops in south korea 
he said american troops contribute to the stability of the 
divided korean peninsula the rest of asia and the entire pacific 
region 
roh holding his first news conference for the foreign press 
since becoming president expressed concern about events in china 
while also expressing hope for early restoration of tranquility 
and stability 
he said the moderating influence of neighboring china on 
korea has been affected by the recent turmoil but he did specify 
south korea regards china an ally of the communist north as having 
moderating influence on militant north korea 
roh said south koreas democratization has not always been easy 
there is still unrest in this country our society has many issues 
to solve as it moves from authoritarianism to democracy 
he said the economy is experiencing difficulties due to labor 
demands excessive consumption and the appreciation of the currency 
but said he was confident the economic and labor problems would be 
resolved 
acknowledging that demands for reduction or withdrawal of 43000 
american troops come from both south korea and washington he said 
he is against making any change in americas commitment to keep 
forces in korea under a mutual defense pact 
he said north korea continues to introduce modern weapons from 
the soviet union and deploys massive troops along the demilitarized 
zone separating the two nations which technically remain at war a 
peace treaty was never signed after the bloody 195053 korean war 
the global trend of relaxation of military tensions seen in 
europe does not apply to korea he said 
democratic lawmakers in washington have urged a reduction in us 
troops in korea saying that the 26 billion spent on them could be 
better used elsewhere they say south korea with seven times the 
gross national product of the north and twice as many people could 
afford its own defense 
roh said keeping troops in korea was the wisest and most 
economical investment americans could make 
he said dissidents and radical students demand withdrawal of us 
troops but that most koreans share my view that america is our 
best and oldest friend and ally 
if it aint broke dont fix it he said 
roh said north korea has made only cosmetic changes in its 
rigid isolationist policy he repeated a call for a summit 
conference with north korean leader kim il sung

a new advocacy group of prominent californians 
gave their state a d grade wednesday for the way it cares for 
children 
children now based its childrens report card on 27 factors 
including infant mortality teenage pregnancy and high school 
graduation rates and drug use among teens according to a press 
release 
the card issued to coincide with the end of the school year 
graded the state in five categories it gave a c for the status 
of childrens health and education a dminus for the teen 
years a dplus for investing in families and a u or 
unsatisfactory grade for childrens safety 
the graders were california supreme court justice allen 
broussard stanford university president dr donald kennedy former 
us secretary of education shirley hufstedler garfield high school 
teacher jaime escalante whose life was depicted in the film stand 
and deliver and former baseball commissioner peter ueberroth 
the report found that california ranked worse than the national 
average in more than threequarters of the areas it researched 
including graduation rates children in poverty and studentteacher 
ratios 
in a few cases the state ranked among the 10 worst states 
we like to think of ourselves as the golden state and we should 
be able to do more for our kids said wendy lazarus vice 
president for policy for the nonprofit foundationfunded group 
founded in 1988 
the good news in this report card is that there are some areas 
that we can be proud of she said we really think its a call 
to action with a message that together we can do it 
the statistics mostly for 1987 and 1988 were gathered from a 
variety of state and federal agencies 
unfortunately on some of the measures there just wasnt any 
information available nobody can tell us how many homeless children 
there are in california so we just gave an incomplete in that 
category ms lazarus said 
state schools chief william honig agreed with the reports 
conclusion 
there is a major problem on comprehensive childrens 
programs he said theres been an explosive growth in poverty 
and were all going to pay the price

stranded on impassable freeways to leave their cars 
at least two fatalities were blamed on allison which was 
downgraded to a tropical depression tuesday morning harris county 
sheriffs department divers pulled a mans body from rainswollen 
spring creek late tuesday on monday a traffic death in the 
beaumont area was attributed to the storm 
two major houston freeways interstate 45 and us 59 were

south of lufkin moving slowly to the northnortheast 
maximum sustained wind speed was 35 mph with 45 mph gusts in 
heavy squalls said the national hurricane center in coral gables 
fla because rain tends to fall to the east and north of such a 
storm the center said 5 to 10 inches of rain was possible over 
extreme southeastern texas and western louisiana before the storm 
moved into southern arkansas 
although heavy rain and flooding is not unusual for houston the 
severity of the freeway problems rivaled hurricane alicia which hit 
in 1983 and tropical storm claudette which dumped more than 20 
inches of rain in 24 hours in 1979 and dropped a national singleday 
record 43 inches in nearby alvin

houston 
for the year the nearly 39 inches of rain so far in houston is 
17 over normal 
it was the second doubledigit rainfall in the area in six weeks 
and some of the same areas hit by a may storm were hit again by 
allison 
we still havent got our insurance money from last time said 
alberto ferrer who will have to clean up his home north of houston

rising temperatures melted globs of congealed oil in the delaware 
river on tuesday complicating efforts to remove the oil spilled 
from a tanker and hearings opened into two other oil spills in 
texas and rhode island 
a harbor pilot testified he radioed three warnings to the tanker 
world prodigy before it hit a reef and spilled 420000 gallons of 
oil off the rhode island coast a coast guard officer said the 
tankers captain apparently used the wrong chart to plot his course 
in texas the pilot of a tanker that collided with a barge in the 
houston ship channel testified tuesday that his vessel didnt react 
as expected just before the accident that ruptured the barge and 
spilled 250000 gallons of oil he said sediment buildup in a 
channel may have kept him from making a turn 
in delaware coast guard commandant adm paul a yost called 
tuesday to promise more action said a spokesman for gov michael 
castle who has complained that the cleanup has been far too slow 
yost said he would put more resources into the cleanup 
immediately said castles press secretary jeff welsh yost also 
promised to put a command post on location wherever it will do the 
most good 
the message from the admiral is this if the governor isnt 
happy the admiral isnt happy welsh said 
delaware officials including castle filed suit in federal court 
seeking unspecified damages against the country of uruguay the 
owner of the tanker 
coast guard officials had said they hoped more than 500 people 
would be involved in the delaware cleanup tuesday but roger a 
lucio of the delaware department of natural resources and 
environmental control said 207 national guard and private contractor 
employees were working along with 100 federal government workers in 
philadelphia coast guard spokesman david oney said delaware was 
sending 150 more guardsmen 
the coast guard reduced its estimate of the spill tuesday saying 
about 306000 gallons of heavy oil down from 800000 gallons 
spilled into the river saturday when the uruguayan tanker presidente 
rivera ran aground 
unlike the lighter oil spilled in rhode island and texas and the 
crude oil that leaked march 24 in alaska the oil coagulated in the 
cool water into chunks ranging in size from a basketball to two or 
three feet 
cleanup workers had been using pitchforks and even their hands to 
snare the globs from the water because skimmers were jammed by the 
larger chunks about 64000 gallons had been recovered as of tuesday 
but on tuesday the temperature headed out of the 80s and into 
the 90s the melting range for the no 6 industrial heating oil 
when weve got it in chunks we can pick it up said coast 
guard capt larry murdock 
liquefied oil poses a much greater hazard to shoreline and to 
wildlife murdock said 
during an inspection tour officials pointed to patches where the 
rainbow hue of petroleum on water showed up and said it was coming 
from oil blobs close enough to the surface to heat and melt 
until tuesday only a short stretch of shoreline had been tainted 
in delaware injuries to wildlife were limited to 25 canada geese 
which were being cleaned at the tri state bird rescue center in 
wilmington del a 26th goose died an additional 50 geese spattered 
with oil were trapped in a lagoon near wilmington 
in providence ri pilot david g leonard 55 told a coast 
guardnational transportation safety board hearing that pleasure 
boat radio traffic may have kept his warnings to the tanker world 
prodigy from being understood he said vital radio channels should 
be freed because pleasure boat interference is common during summer 
virtually all the no 2 heating oil spilled in fridays accident 
had dissipated by tuesday and state officials began reopening 
beaches 
coast guard lt paul cormier said the world prodigys captain 
iakavos georgudis acknowledged seeing a buoy that warns traffic 
away from brenton reef but said i turned the ship too late 
cormier said georgudis was not using a chart with enough detail 
to show the buoy or water depth and said the captain turned the 
ship with a 36foot draft into 30 feet of water 
gov edward d diprete who met the captain on a coast guard 
vessel hours after the accident asked him why there was no pilot 
aboard he said that was my mistake he made no bones about 
it diprete said 
authorities are investigating whether the ship was past the point 
where state law required a pilot on board 
the investigating panel however was blocked from hearing 
testimony from the ships helmsman konstadinos a paraskevopulos 
when his attorney lise j gescheidt advised him to invoke his 
right against selfincrimination 
capt david h whitten who is leading the investigation for the 
coast guard said he was working with the us attorneys office to 
grant paraskevopulos immunity the helmsman who speaks no english 
appeared with a greek translator 
us attorney lincon almond indicated the request would be 
granted 
he could be important to the inquiry and he could be important 
to any criminal prosecutions the prosecutor said 
almond said the captain would not be granted immunity however 
because he was the target of a criminal investigation 
in texas about a dozen huge vacuum machines and regular vacuum 
machines were at work pumping oil from the bayport channel where 
much of the 250000 gallons of oil spilled into the houston ship 
channel was funneled to help in the cleanup coast guard spokesman 
bob morehead said cleanup crews by tuesday had collected 4300 
barrels of oil from the water morehead said 
tanker pilot michael gale said he was trying to make a right turn 
from the bayport channel into the ship channel but the tanker 
continued straight ahead and collided with the barge friday 
my only opinion is she didnt have enough water underneath her 
keel gale said it could have been caused by too much sediment 
in the channel 
gale a pilot for 12 years said he has made 2700 trips in the 
channel

gov steve cowper on tuesday offered to 
share the lessons alaska has learned from the nations worst oil 
spill with five states affected by a recent rash of spills 
i stand ready to offer you alaskas expertise learned the hard 
way from three months on the front lines of north americas largest 
oil spill cowper said in letters sent to the states governors 
he referred to the march 24 exxon valdez spill which polluted 
alaskas prince william sound with nearly 11 million gallons of 
crude oil the cleanup of that spill is in no way over he said 
copwer also asked the governors of delaware new jersey 
pennsylvania rhode island and texas to help him push for federal 
legislation to prevent spills and improve the nations ability to 
respond to them 
he outlined his proposals for improving tanker safety and 
spillresponse capabilities 
it is clear that the industry from producers to shippers does 
not have the equipment expertise or technology to mount an 
effective response in a critically short period of time cowper 
said 
the united states should adopt the advanced technology of other 
oilproducing nations especially norway and the soviet union which 
provided alaska with expert help after the exxon valdez spill he 
said 
alaskas governor noted that federal law allows the party 
responsible for the spill to direct the cleanup until it is either 
unwilling or unable to do so 
the public shouldnt have to wait for a spiller to quit or 
fail we should have the ability to act quickly without worrying 
about emptying federal or state treasuries cowper wrote

a federal judge tuesday ordered an end 
to wildcat strikes by nearly 43000 coal miners in nine states 
saying they are violating us labor law 
us district judge dennis knapp said the walkout by united mine 
workers members violated national labor relations act guidelines 
against secondary boycotts the walkout began june 12 in support of 
1900 umw members who have been on strike against the pittston coal 
group since april 5 
knapp issued a temporary injunction at the request of the 
national labor relations board the judge stopped short of forcing 
the miners back on the job but said union officials must report to 
the nlrb within 10 days on what steps they have taken to meet the 
court order 
umw president richard trumka said union officials do not 
believe an injunction is warranted in this case 
these work stoppages are not sanctioned by the union and the 
international has requested the affected members to return to 
work trumka said in a prepared statement we will take the 
necessary steps to comply with the courts order as we review the 
next legal steps 
gov gaston caperton applauded knapps order 
its so important to get people back to work everybodys 
interested in finding new ways to finding a solution to this 
problem caperton said in huntington where he attended an 
economic development seminar 
knapp ordered the umw to stop any activities that might cause 
miners to continue to strike and to halt any threats or coercion 
against the coal companies 
he also told the umw to inform miners that union officials have 
no objection to their return to work and that miners would not be 
disciplined by the union for resuming work 
there were no immediate reports of strikers heeding the order 
but most began their twoweek vacations this week and the coal 
fields have been relatively quiet since the weekend 
earlier in the walkout there were rowdy and sometimes violent 
attempts by miners to block replacement workers and coal trucks as 
miners ignored previous backtowork court orders 
jim strickland director of public relations for the drummond 
co one of alabamas largest coal producers said the company was 
pleased with the court order 
the international union will now notify its members that they 
should return to work at companies such as ours that have no labor 
disputes in question strickland said in a statement in light 
of this order drummond fully expects its umwa employees to report 
to work 
the bituminous coal operators association claims the umw is 
violating a nostrike clause contained in a national contract signed 
in february 1988 pittston refused to sign the association contract 
claiming that as the nations largest coal exporter it needed more 
flexibility to deal with foreign competition 
about 1600 umw miners in virginia and west virginia struck 
pittston after working 14 months without a contract they were 
joined by 300 pittston miners in kentucky earlier this month 
the judge could have restricted the backtowork order to west 
virginia and parts of virginia kentucky and ohio but ordered that 
it apply nationwide to all coal companies that have umw contracts 
at one point 46000 miners in missouri west virginia alabama 
illinois indiana kentucky ohio pennsylvania tennessee and 
virginia were off the job missouris miners went back to work on 
monday

a new scandal ignited wednesday as prime minister 
sousuke uno already suffering from allegations of an affair with a 
former geisha was hit with reports of two other liaisons 
the reports which appeared in a popular womens magazine josei 
jishin alleged that uno had affairs with a hostess in the ginza 
entertainment district from 1962 to 1972 and with a geisha from 1975 
to 1984 
before the magazine hit the stands wednesday rumors that uno was 
considering resigning less than a month after taking office on june 
2 reflected in overseas financial markets and surfaced in the 
japanese press 
top stories in major national newspapers said leaders of the 
governing liberal democratic party held an emergency meeting tuesday 
night and persuaded uno to stay in office 
according to reports in asahi shimbun mainichi shimbun and 
yomiuri shimbun among other newspapers uno told advisers the 
reports of womanizing insulted his dignity he said they made it 
difficult for him to meet other world leaders at such forums as the 
paris summit in july 
on wednesday uno denied reports that he expressed desire to 
resign over the scandals 
i didt say such a thing uno told reporters referring to 
the reports 
the yomiuri shimbun and mainichi shimbun quoted sources close to 
the prime minister as saying if i am troubling you further i 
must resign 
i cannot manage my job receiving such an insult i didnt 
become prime minister because i wanted to yomiuri quoted uno as 
saying 
but mainichi said uno also said i will not resign for awhile 
whatever happens 
uno told a group of legislators and businessmen attending a trade 
meeting wednesday that he would attend the paris summit of major 
industrial powers 
as japans representative i must discuss important issues with 
leaders from other countries an official of the prime ministers 
office quoted uno as saying 
the scandals come as the liberal democrats who have ruled japan 
for 34 years struggle to regroup after the resignation of prime 
minister noboru takeshita who left office after being linked to the 
recruit influencepeddling scandal which tainted many of the 
partys elite 
the scandal is widely expected to hurt the party in an election 
this weekend for the tokyo metropolitan assembly and in voting next 
month for half the seats in parliaments upper house 
uno when questioned in parliament refused to comment on earlier 
reports he paid a geisha to be his mistress in 1985 saying it was a 
private matter 
after a setback for the ruling party in a byelection sunday 
however he acknowledged rumors of womanizing had added to damage 
done to the party by the recruit scandal 
uno was foreign minister until he was drafted on june 2 to be 
prime minister ending the partys search for a politician with a 
clean image to help it overcome the widespread recruit scandal 
the report in josei jishin claimed that uno began his affair with 
the ginza hostess identified in the article only as ms y 50 
several years after he was first elected to parliament in 1960 
it said the other geisha who also was not named met uno once a 
week from 1975 to 1984 and was paid the equivalent of about 700 a 
month 
on sunday a former geisha appeared on television to say she was 
paid by uno to be his mistress in 1985 mitsuko nakanishi 40 
claimed that under a contract with her geisha house uno paid the 
equivalent of 14280 to the house and 7140 to her in addition to 
monthly payments of 2100 over four months 
contrary to their reputation overseas real geisha are not 
prostitutes but are highly trained entertainers well versed in the 
arts and in conversation most work in traditional japanese 
restaurants often frequented by politicians and businessmen some 
become mistresses of favored patrons

purposes 
moving tuesday to slow down a possible stampede for 
constitutional change foley announced that hearings will be held in 
july on setting aside the court ruling that threw out flag 
desecration laws in 48 states 
he acted only hours after president bush joined a chorus of 
lawmakers in proclaiming that a constitutional amendment a process 
used only 26 times in the nations history is the only solution to 
change the 54 ruling 
foley dwash said the house judiciary committee hearings are 
not going to be rushed but they will not be obstructive they will 
be conducted calmly in the spirit of deliberation and care we

president bush seems more interested in defending 
the flag than defending the ideas the flag represents say civil 
rights leaders who heard a speech by attorney general dick 
thornburgh 
in his address tuesday to operation push thornburgh said the 
bush administration wouldnt immediately pursue legislation to 
overturn controversial us supreme court rulings on job 
discrimination 
thornburgh said the administration wanted to first assess the 
impact of the high court rulings on antidiscrimination laws 
jesse jackson founder of the chicagobased operation push 
expressed disappointment with thornburghs waitandsee message 
he and others contrasted it with bushs immediate call for a 
constitutional amendment to set aside last weeks supreme court 
ruling nullifying flag desecration laws in 48 states 
we cannot help but notice the haste with which bush has rushed 
to defend the flag and his lack of haste in defending the substance 
that flag stands for which is equality under the law and 
fairness jackson said after thornburghs speech

the 1985 farm law will expire at the end of 
1990 after a fiveyear run reviews are mixed but its doubtful 
that capitol hill critics will force a major rewrite of the 
hackneyed old script 
for one thing the law properly the food security act of 1985 
allowed the agriculture department to reduce some of the subsidies 
and price formulas tied to certain commodities such as wheat corn 
and cotton 
the law and usda decisions it permitted have effectively reduced 
some of the high price supports that many economists say had priced 
the united states out of international export markets with lower 
prices us grain has been better able to compete they say 
but much of the 1985 farm law resembles its ancestors going back 
to the 1930s by authorizing production controls when deemed 
appropriate and providing basic price supports to designated 
commodities 
despite a mathematical chance of an ideological upheaval in 
congress over farm policy and whether to get the government out of 
the commodity markets once and for all the odds greatly favor a 
continuation of the present system with a little tinkering here 
and there 
and guess what even if congress fails to write a new farm bill 
the government programs would simply revert to permanent 
legislation written in 1949 and 1933 
susan l pollack of the departments economic research service 
says the issues currently facing lawmakers include ways of cutting 
costs more flexibility for crop plantings trade liberalization 
food safety environmental concerns rural development nutrition 
and hunger and research 
the bush administration and many members of congress have 
expressed satisfaction with the 1985 farm law despite some record 
outlays for commodity programs she said 
in fiscal 1984 spending by usdas commodity credit corp on 
various programs including feed grains wheat rice cotton 
tobacco dairy soybeans honey wool and disaster assistance 
totaled about 73 billion 
spending in 1985 rose to 177 billion and in 1986 climbed to a 
record of more than 258 billion costs dropped to 224 billion in 
1987 to 125 billion in 1988 and are expected to edge up to 138 
billion in 1989 the forecast for 1990 currently is 116 billion 
less than half the earlier peak 
strong pressure to cut domestic spending however will 
continue to force lawmakers to scrutinize farm program costs 
pollack said in the july issue of agricultural outlook magazine 
costcutting proposals have included further reductions in target 
prices used to determine subsidies or deficiency payments to 
farmers setting target prices to reflect the costs of production 
and establishing more flexible acreage bases 
a socalled triplebase concept advocated since 1985 by rep 
charles stenholm dtexas would give farm participants the option 
of planting a crop of their choice on part of their acreage base 
without losing acreage credit 
pollack said the concept would continue to divide a farmers 
total crop base into permitted acreage and acreage idled under 
the acreage reduction program or arp but the permitted acreage 
would be divided further into a base for program crops that would 
continue to be eligible for federal payments and a flexible 
base 
crops produced on the flexible base would not be eligible for 
deficiency payments 
proponents hope the triple base concept would decrease federal 
expenses by cutting the number of acres receiving payments while 
giving farmers more flexibility as to what they can plant she 
said and the triple base would continue the movement toward a 
more marketoriented agriculture 
one of the heavyweight issues for 1990 farm legislation continues 
to be agricultural trade us farm exports in the doldrums a few 
years ago have improved substantially partly because of aggressive 
overseas selling policies including export subsidies to offset 
similar competition from the european economic community 
congressional observers expect the new farm bill to continue 
boosting us farm exports with targeted subsidies and to keep the 
pressure on other nations for trade reforms pollack said 
meanwhile if current trade negotiations under the uruguay round 
are successful the new farm bill would have to be amended to 
reflect such changes those amendments to the 1990 farm law 
however would take place after negotiations under the general 
agreement on tariffs and trade are completed 
some other issues that pollack said are becoming more important 
to farm bill debate 
food safety and groundwater contamination recent concerns about 
the chemical alar used on apples are examples along with continued 
problems with poultry and meat inspection establishing seafood 
inspection and the labeling of food products to disclose more 
information about cholesterol sodium fat and calorie content of 
food are other possible issues 
lowinput agriculture which calls for less chemical fertilizers 
and pesticides one bill by sen wyche fowler dga would use 
cash incentives and tax breaks to encourage farmers to voluntarily 
review farm chemical use and to cut back where possible 
rural development many bills have been introduced to improve 
rural health services education transportation and water systems 
a comprehensive bill by sen patrick leahy dvt includes loans 
and grant programs that would involve all levels of government and 
the private sector 
crop insurance agriculture secretary clayton yeutter has told 
congress the program needs to be overhauled the administration also 
says droughtrelief legislation forces the taxpayer to subsidize 
those farmers who choose not to buy crop insurance 
sugar program critics say the system of limiting imports of 
sugar through quotas to maintain higher domestic prices should be 
changed defenders say it has worked well to protect us sugar 
interests and the american consumer

buzz aldrin laments that the 
promise of apollo was never fulfilled that the american space 
program languished after he and neil armstrong left the first human 
footprints on the moon two decades ago 
he says he hopes the 20th anniversary of apollo 11 will become 
a catalyst for the country to chart a bold course for human 
expansion outward 
but given todays political and tight budgetary climate aldrin 
is not too hopeful 
president bush is expected to voice continuing support for a 
permanent manned space station and say other nice things about 
nasas program when he meets with aldrin armstrong and their 
command module pilot michael collins on july 20 the anniversary 
of the moon landing 
but no matter how many nice things the president says about 
space the political truth is that congress must approve the money 
and with the space station already facing a sharp funding cut 
congress is not expected to give much support to new projects 
so the national aeronautics and space administration once again 
is at a crossroads as it was when the glory days of apollo ended 
president john f kennedy had committed this nation to landing a 
man on the moon in the 1960s the goal was to gain space superiority 
over the soviet union whose early feats had earned the russians 
worldwide respect and shocked americans 
when the united states won the race to the moon nasa laid out 
bold plans for the future 
to a presidential panel agency head thomas paine in 1969 
proposed a 12man space station and a reusable space shuttle in 
operation as early as 1976 followed by a station in moon orbit a 
base on the moon a 50man space station in earth orbit and a manned 
mission to mars in the 1980s 
but in a period of unrest due to domestic racial problems and 
involvement in vietnam costly plans to explore space were given low 
priority 
only the reuseable space shuttle survived and its proposed 
funding was cut deeply 
those were tough times said paine who resigned in 
frustration a year after apollo 11 
the ford and carter administrations were lukewarm toward the 
space program but the shuttle was built it performed capably as a 
space truck for 24 missions until jan 28 1986 when the challenger 
exploded killing its seven crew members and grounding the program 
for 32 months 
nasa had gained some hope from president reagans endorsement of 
a strong space program and from his 1984 state of the union message 
in which he backed building the space station freedom 
in 1985 congress created a commission to define longterm space 
goals its chief was thomas paine the former nasa administrator 
six months after challenger paine stood in the oval office and 
gave reagan a slick leatherbound volume that recommended the space 
station a lunar base and manned trips to mars essentially an 
update of paines 1969 plan 
reagan two years later signed a presidential directive on 
national space policy that stated space leadership was a fundamental 
objective it endorsed the space station and without being 
specific set a longrange goal to expand human presence and 
activity beyond earth orbit into the solar system 
reagans policy set in motion a nasa program named pathfinder 
whose goal is to test technologies for manned and robotic 
exploration of the moon and planets advanced missions in orbit and 
on planetary surfaces extended human presence in space and space 
transportation to the moon and planets 
bush has not disclosed his thinking beyond saying he supports a 
space station he established the national space council headed by 
vice president dan quayle to recommend a comprehensive space policy 
quayle is expected to have a preliminary outline ready for bushs 
anniversary meeting with the apollo 11 astronauts 
nasa needs a decision from congress soon on how much money it can 
spend next year on space station freedom a permanent orbiting space 
station is essential to those ambitious pathfinder dreams and would 
serve as a training base and launch pad for flights deeper into 
space 
bush has requested 205 billion in the budget for fiscal 1990 to 
continue work on the station predictions are that congress will 
trim that by 400 million to 700 million amounts that space 
officials say could further delay or even kill the project 
the space station project has gone through five tumultuous years 
reagan wanted it built in cooperation with americas major allies 
but there were stormy sessions over access to the station before 10 
european nations japan and canada agreed to invest nearly 8 
billion to build sections of it 
nasa said in 1984 it could begin launching segments of the 
orbiting laboratory in 1992 and estimated the us cost at 8 
billion in 1987 agency officials revised the pricetag to 146 
billion the new figure covered a suddenly scaleddown phase one 
which left off two of the external struts to which experiment 
modules would be attached the struts would be added in orbit under 
phase two 
shortly after that a national research council panel reviewing 
station costs and technical issues for the white house said the 
total cost to develop and deploy the first phase would be 2502 
billion with phase two raising the cost to 328 billion 
the schedule began slipping and nasa now says if it receives the 
proper funding it could begin assembling the station in 1995 
some in congress believe nasa should alter its plans and build a 
less complex station and instead of relying totally on the space 
shuttle develop a large unmanned rocket to do much of the lifting 
job 
orbiting at 250 miles freedom would be home to a crew of eight 
with astronauts rotating back to earh after four to six months 
the station would allow humans to study the stars and planets 
from the pollutionfree environment of space the weightless 
interior would permit manufacture of new contaminationfree 
medicines and other products impossible to create on earth 
astronauts would assemble service and repair satellites and send 
them out into space and the station could eventually be the staging 
point for mans return to the moon or a journey to mars 
no one can predict whether these grand plans will come about but 
the three astronauts who made that extraordinary apollo 11 flight to 
the moon 20 years ago think they should 
a permanent presence in space is a worthy objective and i hope 
that space station freedom becomes a reality neil armstrong said 
recently 
i strongly endorse the station a scientific base on the moon 
and eventually manned flights to mars said buzz aldrin 
michael collins who orbited the moon while armstrong and aldrin 
walked its surface envisioned setting up a colony on mars 
were a nation of explorers he said we started on the 
east coast we went to the west coast and then vertically starting 
with the wright brothers chuck yeager through the sound barrier 
armstrong and aldrin on the moon 
its in our tradition its in our culture

while america marks the 20th 
anniversary of mans landing on the moon nasa has on its wish list 
a permanent scientific lunar outpost early next century 
when astronauts neil armstrong and buzz aldrin set foot in the 
lunar dust july 20 1969 some scientists saw it as a logical step 
toward building a research base there 
but no overwhelming public or political support developed for 
such an expensive undertaking and blueprints were shelved 
some scientists continued through the years to yearn for a moon 
base mineralrich lunar soil could support crops grown under 
pressurized domes researchers say and a commercially valuable gas 
prevalent on the moon could be returned to earth where it is rare 
the scientists have a glimmer of hope in a document released last 
december by nasas office of exploration beyond earths horizons 
human exploration of the solar system in the 21st century it 
outlined possibilities for two moon bases among four potential 
manned expeditions the other two involve flights to the martian 
moon phobos and to mars itself 
one of the moon bases envisioned would not be permanently 
staffed it would serve chiefly as an astronomy laboratory where 
telescopes free of the earths obscuring atmosphere and interfering 
electronic transmissions could study the most distant radioemitting 
galaxies and search for extraterrestrial life 
the exploration office plan puts this unmanned base on the moons 
far side which is permanently hidden from earth each of four 
successive fourperson crews would work through a 14day lunar day 
setting up equipment delivered by unmanned cargo vehicles before 
returning to earth or an orbiting space station as a 14day night 
begins staying through a frigid lunar night would require 
considerable extra support equipment 
once the observatory is built the telescopes would operate 
automatically sending images and data to earth through a satellite 
orbiting the moon or the ground could direct them to look at 
certain celestial objects 
astronauts would return to the base every three years to service 
the equipment and to collect and replace telescope film 
the second base on the front side of the moon would be 
permanently manned 
many astronaut crews over several years would be required to 
construct an antarctictype facility using raw building materials 
already there the apollo missions disclosed that every shovelful of 
lunar soil is rich in metals and silicon and that this soil can be 
mixed with water to form a type of cement 
oxygen is the most abundant element on the moon and this can be 
combined with hydrogen to make water because oxygen is fivesixths 
of what rocket engines burn the base could also serve as a tank 
farm for spacecraft flying between earth and the moon or embarking 
for mars or elsewhere in the solar system 
a lunar resource of potentially great commercial value is 
helium3 an isotope of helium with three atomic nuclei instead of 
the more common two physicists see it as a cleaner more efficient 
alternative to the fuels foreseen for conventional fusion reactors 
to generate electrical power 
on earth helium3 exists only in very small quantities as a 
byproduct of nuclear weapons production but on the moon it is 
abundant deposited by the suns charged particles 
studies done by the fusion technology institute at the university 
of wisconsin and nasa indicate that as little as 40000 pounds of 
helium3 could be transported to earth on just two lunar return 
trips used in a national array of fusion reactors this amount 
could supply the energy needs of the united states for a year 
the exploration office study says either or both moon bases could 
be started early in the next century the report did not include 
expedition costs but frank martin chief of the office said 
its clear that in order to do these things you are going to have 
to spend more money a larger percentage of the federal budget

thats one small step for a man 
one giant leap for mankind 
twenty years have passed nearly a generation since neil 
armstrong called those momentous words down from the moon 
two decades since earthlings watched those flickering television 
images saw that tentative first step on the dusty surface and 
looked on in wonder as two americans hopped about in weak gravity 
planted and saluted their flag picked up bits of lunar treasure and 
spoke with their president a quarter million miles away 
most people living then can tell you today where they were when 
astronauts neil armstrong and buzz aldrin took those first steps on 
the moon sunday july 20 1969 
they were realizing a goal that john f kennedy had set in 
frustration and desperation 
kennedy came to office in january 1961 with a pledge to get 
this country moving again the economy was sluggish fidel castro 
had taken over cuba and the united states trailed the soviets in 
the highly visible arena of space 
the space chasm widened april 12 1961 when soviet cosmonaut 
yuri a gagarin blasted into orbit the first man to fly in space 
american prestige was rocked again five days later on april 17 
a brigade of cuban exiles sponsored by the central intelligence 
agency stormed the beach at cubas bay of pigs in an effort to 
overthrow castro his forces routed the illequipped exiles leaving 
the united states and its young president in shame and disarray 
kennedy accepted the blame and decided bold action was needed to 
restore americas honor space was the answer he concluded and he 
gave vice president lyndon johnson the task of determining what 
could be done 
on april 28 the national aeronautics and space council which 
johnson chaired submitted a preliminary report to the president 
the moon is a good target for us it said 
even as the president and his advisers were discussing moon 
trips some in the administration were concerned about the first 
us maninspace flight now set for may 2 with everything going 
wrong for the nation the impact of a failure could be devastating 
but kennedy let the launch date stand and on may 5 after a 
threeday weather delay astronaut alan shepard rode a slender 
redstone rocket and a cramped mercury capsule 115 miles up and 302 
miles down the atlantic tracking range on a 15minute suborbital 
flight 
america heaved a sigh of relief the soviets were still ahead 
but the united states was on the move 
on may 25 four months after taking office kennedy delivered a 
special state of the union message on urgent national needs it 
covered many subjects from the economy to disarmament it also 
dealt with space 
i believe this nation should commit itself to achieving the 
goal before the decade is out of landing a man on the moon and 
returning him safely to earth no single space project in this 
period will be more impressive to mankind or more important to the 
longrange exploration of space and none will be so difficult or 
expensive to accomplish 
the project was called apollo after the greek archergod the 
god of light and truth brightshining farshooting 
christopher c kraft jr who would become flight operations 
director for apollo was a nasa engineer working on the mercury 
project 
i thought he had lost his mind kraft said of kennedy and his 
bold commitment we had a total of 15 minutes of manned 
spaceflight experience we hadnt flown mercury in orbit yet and 
heres a guy telling me were going to fly to the moon doing it 
was one thing but doing it in this decade was to me too risky 
despite the doubts of kraft and others within nasa americas 
biggest costliest and most ambitious technological effort began 
with virtually no dissent before it was achieved more than 20000 
industrial contractors and 420000 technicians engineers and other 
skilled persons would be involved 
while the hardware of apollo was being developed and tested 
americans and russians were learning to live and work in space and 
to perfect the rockets spaceships and techniques for going to the 
moon 
to a watching world it was like a relay race in space the 
russians with their larger booster rockets and larger manned 
spacecraft held the early lead 
john glenn in 1962 was hailed as americas first orbital 
champion three more mercury orbital flights proved man could 
survive and function for at least a short time in weightless space 
nasa moved on in 1965 to the twoman gemini program and 10 
exciting flights in 20 months tested and proved all the rendezvous 
and docking and space walking procedures needed to travel to the 
moon 
the russians too were perfecting these techniques but by early 
1967 as the united states was ready to move into manned apollo 
flights america seemed to have a slight lead based on superior 
computer and other technologies 
then tragedy 
in a countdown test on jan 27 1967 a month before the planned 
launch faulty wiring released a spark that touched off an inferno 
inside the apollo 1 cabin the flames intensified by the 100 
percent oxygen environment incinerated the threeman crew gus 
grissom ed white and roger chaffee 
three months after the apollo fire cosmonaut vladimir komarov 
rode into orbit in a new spacecraft named soyuz believed to be a 
test model for a lunar command ship after a day in orbit as he 
returned to earth soyuz 1 tumbled became tangled in its parachute 
straps and crashed komarov became the worlds first inflight space 
casualty 
in both countries critics brought their guns to bear on both 
space programs each was halted for nearly two years while repairs 
were made 
apollo was reexamined rewired redesigned and finally flew 
apollo 7 orbited the earth for 11 days in october 1968 and then in 
a bold move nasa officials decided to fly the threeman apollo 8 
crew into orbit about the moon on christmas eve 1968 
they reasoned the flight would provide vital information about 
navigating to and around the moon buy time while the lagging lunar 
landing module was readied and rob the soviets of any glory they 
might reap by looping one man once around the backside of the moon 
on a translunar trajectory there was a widely reported rumor that 
the soviets were ready to do just that 
the mission was a huge uplifting success and two more flights 
one in which two astronauts swooped to within 10 miles of the lunar 
surface set the stage for the main event apollo 11 
more than 1 million people tourists congressmen diplomats 
business people reporters and movie stars came to watch the 
launch at the kennedy space center on july 16 1969 all eyes stared 
at the sheet of flame as the mighty saturn 5 rose ponderously from 
launch pad 39a precisely on schedule at 932 am and sent a 
thunderclap across the scrubland 
in the spaceship on the tip of the rocket were neil alden 
armstrong 38 a civilian the commander air force col edwin 
eugene aldrin jr 39 the lunar module pilot and air force lt 
col michael collins 38 the command module pilot ambassadors

several times in the final minutes 
before man first touched down on the moons surface the astronauts 
and ground controllers came close to aborting the attempt 
there were some scary things during that descent astronaut 
neil armstrong recalled later especially those computer alarms 
after separating from mike collins and the mother ship columbia 
armstrong and buzz aldrin in the lunar module eagle swooped behind 
the backside of the moon out of radio contact with mission control 
in houston 
armstrong fired the descent engine on the farside 70 minutes 
before the planned touchdown 
ground controllers did not know until 39 minutes later when 
eagle returned to radio range whether the engine had fired 
successfully to shift the astronauts into an orbital path whose low 
point was just 98 miles above the surface 
once eagle reached this closest approach armstrong had five 
seconds to decide whether to ignite the descent engine again to drop 
to the surface or to abort and initiate a rendezvous course to 
columbia 
as the critical moment approached mission control detected two 
problems that could cause an abort 
we were getting broken voice and telemetry communications 
recalls gene kranz the apollo 11 flight director who today is 
director of flight operations at the johnson space center in houston 
immediately it flashed through my mind this basic ground rule 
that i had to be sure that whatever happened we had to have data 
during this critical attempt at descent and landing kranz said 
the data was broken but the key stuff was there and we were able 
to improve it by making a minor change in the lms attitude 
at the same time stephen bales the 26yearold guidance officer 
in the control center detected the module was going toward the 
moon about 15 miles an hour faster than the guidance computer 
thought it was because some navigation errors had been introduced 
into the system 
now 15 miles an hour doesnt sound like much but we had an 
abort limit that i was supposed to call that said if this thing grew 
to 23 miles an hour i had to stop the landing i had to say no 
go bales said 
that much excess speed would have pushed eagle outside the 
previously photographed landing zone in the sea of tranquillity 
we did not want them trying to land in unfamiliar territory 
said bales who today is chief of the systems division at the 
johnson space center in houston fortunately the spacecraft did not 
gain additional speed 
these problems resolved armstrong was given the green light to 
again start the descent engine he pressed the button landing on 
the sea of tranquillity was 12 minutes away 
suddenly computer alarm lights began flashing in the cabin the 
guidance computer was overtaxed and eagle again was rapidly 
approaching an abort situation 
the computer was on a fixed onesecond cycle bales said 
it had to navigate it had to guide it had to display data to the 
crew it had to trim the engine and if it couldnt get all its jobs 
done in one second it gave this overload alarm 
fortunately the guys who programmed it were very sharp and 
they put the least needed tasks at the bottom of the stack and the 
most needed at the top he said we had seen the same thing in a 
simulator run just two weeks before the launch and because i could 
see the computer was solving all the right problems i told gene 
kranz to have the crew ignore the alarms and keep going 
chris kraft the flight operations director who now is a private 
aerospace consultant said in a recent interview that bales 
contribution was absolutely vital 
without his ability to see into the operations of that 
computer we would have waved off aborted kraft said 
another abort situation faced armstrong and aldrin as they neared 
the surface because of the navigation error they were coming in 
about four miles west of their planned touchdown point instead of 
the relatively smooth area theyd expected eagle was coming down in 
an area strewn with boulders and pocked with craters 
armstrong took manual control and began flying the module like a 
helicopter searching for a smooth spot 
we didnt know what was going on bales said we knew he 
was close to the surface but was not landing he was running out of 
gas and i said were going to have to abort for gas 
armstrong had only about 12 seconds of fuel left when he dropped 
eagle onto the surface 
houston tranquillity base here the eagle has landed 
armstrong reported 
roger tranquillity said astronaut charlie duke the capsule 
communicator in the control center we copy you on the ground you 
got a bunch of guys about to turn blue were breathing again 
everyone in the control center was cheering applauding flight 
director kranz suddenly realized discipline was breaking down that 
the team had to be ready to make splitsecond decisions in case the 
astronauts had to make a sudden takeoff from the moon 
all right everyone he said get settled down theres a 
lot of work to do 
within seconds they were preparing for a possible emergency 
liftoff 
radio data indicated pressure in a descent engine fuel line 
apparently because it was frozen 
that started sounding pretty bad bales recalled gene 
called down to me and said i dont have time to follow what youre 
doing because ive got to follow this freezing problem you just 
make sure youve got all the right stuff loaded into the computer 
because we may be lifting off that really bothered me because it 
would be a shame if we had to lift off now 
as we were loading the right insertion velocity azimuth and 
other things into the lm computer the line that they were talking 
about ruptured bales said it caused no damage and because it 
was on the nolongerneeded descent engine everything was ok that 
was a big big big relief they stayed on the moon

neil armstrong the first man on the 
moon withstood the pressure of fame buzz aldrin the second 
moonwalker was not so lucky 
after they returned to earth as heroes along with pilot michael 
collins who had stayed in lunar orbit there were months of public 
appearances goodwill visits abroad and seemingly endless interviews 
and autograph signing 
the three apollo 11 crewmen remained with nasa for awhile 
in 1971 armstrong retreated to the privacy he craved he also 
realized a dream to teach becoming a professor of aerospace 
engineering at the university of cincinnati 
after nine years at the university he became an aerospace 
consultant today he is chairman of cta inc in lebanon ohio a 
computer systems company now 58 he and his wife jan live on a 
farm near lebanon 
aldrin had trouble handling the postapollo 11 celebrations and 
subsequent disappointments when he returned to active military duty 
with the air force 
my depression was brought on by being thrust into the 
uncomfortable area of public relations followed by a period of 
wondering where you fit in after being an astronaut on the moon 
aldrin said 
an air force colonel in 1971 he was named commander of the 
aerospace research pilots school at edwards air force base calif 
a school i didnt know anything about after being away from the 
service 10 years he said his previous military training had not 
prepared him to be a leader 
eight months later aldrin checked into a military hospital in 
san antonio texas i was on my way to having a good oldfashioned 
american nervous breakdown i realized it and asked for help 
he went through bouts with mental illness and alcoholism but 
recovered from and lectured on both during this bad period he was 
divorced remarried and divorced again he wrote a book return to 
earth about those troubled times 
after his recovery he retired from the air force and became an 
aerospace consultant today at 59 he has remarried and is 
president of his own los angelesbased firm research amp engineering 
he is author of a recently published book about his apollo 11 
experience men from earth 
collins left nasa in january 1970 to become assistant secretary 
of state for public affairs a year later he joined the smithsonian 
institution as director of the national air and space museum 
overseeing the building of the museum which opened in 1976 
in 1980 collins became vice president of the vought corporation 
and in 1985 be became president of his own company michael collins 
associates in washington where he and wife pat live 
im trying to make a living as a writer collins 58 said 
recently he has written carrying the fire and liftoff two 
highly acclaimed books about the space program im currently 
writing a book on mars

the footprints left in the lunar dust 
20 years ago by apollo 11 astronauts neil armstrong and buzz aldrin 
should be visible for half a million years because the moon has no 
atmosphere to erode them says a california chemist 
but the absence of an atmosphere also leaves the moon unprotected 
from meteorite and cosmic ray strikes and these eventually will 
erase the footprints reports james r arnold 
arnold who calls himself a cosmochemist is director of the 
california space institute at the university of california san 
diego 
the moon is a quiet place lacking an atmosphere and is 
therefore free of wind and rain he said 
arnold and his colleagues have developed techniques to measure 
the rate of erosion and turnover of rocks and soil on the moon by 
studying radioactive isotopes in samples brought back from six 
apollo lunar landing missions

offended by it said coors spokesman joe fuentes we never 
intended that were going to drop the commercial were going to 
apologize for any concern that it may have caused 
edward ostrowski a past grand marshal of new yorks pulaski day

they told me they were going to drop it a week ago ostrowski 
said in a telephone interview from new york theyre still showing 
it i think it was a slap in the face of the polish people 
it makes fun of our national music and our heritage its a 
disgusting variation of polish jokes and demonstrates an amazing 
lack of sensitivity not only by coors officials but also by the ad 
agency who devised this piece of trash 
fuentes said the commercial for coors extra gold beer was part of 
a series by the goldenbased brewer called party time tips 
set in a singles rock n roll bar actor tom arcuragi a polka 
fan said he had a tip for patrons who have trouble reaching the bar 
to get another coors extra gold he then goes to the jukebox and 
plays a polka and the bar empties out 
arcuragi played in a polka band for six years fuentes said 
it was not our intention to offend anyone he said it was 
designed to take a humorous look at a slice of american life were 
just kind of exaggerating the music preference

sixtyfive book publishers nationwide 
say they are being squeezed financially and half may be forced out 
of business because millions of dollars worth of their books have 
been tied up in a bankruptcy dispute 
the complicated case in federal bankruptcy court here involves 
the small publishing houses a bridgeport distributor that has 
failed to repay 3 million in bank loans the hartford bank that 
loaned the money and a new york book sales organization 
in order to collect on the loans the connecticut bank and trust 
co has threatened to sell all the publishers inventory held at the 
distributors warehouse 
the bank and distributor believe receipts generated by the sale 
of the books belong to the distributor the publishers disagree 
cbt may or may not win their argument that it has some right to 
the publishers books but knows that it can bring the publishers to 
their knees in the meantime because we have to have our inventory to 
survive said rollin riggs president of one of the affected 
companies mustang publishing of new haven 
riggs and representatives of the other publishers the owner of 
the distributorship and a host of attorneys were at us bankruptcy 
court in bridgeport on tuesday they had hoped to make some progress 
in settling the issue but couldnt even agree on when to return to 
court for their next pretrial hearing 
as it now stands a trial might not begin until december meaning 
the books could be held until at least that time 
the case began march 9 when key book service the bridgeport 
distributor filed for protection under chapter 11 of the federal 
bankruptcy act 
three weeks later the publishers sales group filed for chapter 
11 protection 
the sales organization kampmann amp co of new york had been 
hired by the publishers to warehouse and ship their books as well 
as collect money for the publishers it was kampmann amp co that 
contracted with key book in 1987 to distribute the books 
as part of its reorganization plan kampmann amp co reached an 
agreement with a new distributor in maryland but when it sought to

100000 he said the books represent about half his assets 
unlike riggs shaw said he could continue to publish if the bank 
seizes all the books but i will lose everything i have earned in 
the past 10 years he said 
eric m kampmann president of the sales group said about half 
the 65 publishers would be put out of business if the books are 
seized and sold at discount by the bank 
harold levine owner of key book for 40 years said tuesday that 
he didnt want to harm the publishers and that it was cbts decision 
to obtain a court order blocking distribution of the books 
levine also said it was the publishers fault that their books 
were put on hold he said that if the publishers hadnt attempted to 
move the books cbt wouldnt have acted 
the independent publishers brought this to a head he said 
it didnt come out of left field we didnt pick on those guys 
because theyre small and we want to beat on them

a bush administration economic panel has 
debated whether to extend steel import barriers as signs pointed to 
a compromise decision aimed at mollifying opponents of the 
restraints 
the fiveyear curbs expire sept 30 
white house officials said that the cabinetlevel economic policy 
council met privately tuesday to discuss the controversial trade 
program among those on the council are commerce secretary robert 
mosbacher who would oversee the steel trade program and us trade 
representative carla hills whose office would negotiate the 
restraints with other nations 
administration officials speaking on condition of anonymity 
said it was a guessing game whether a decision by bush would be 
released before the end of the week the officials said bush was 
anxious to keep a campaign pledge to renew the curbs but that he 
hoped to appease manufacturers and lawmakers who believe the program 
has caused steel shortages 
his bushs tendency seems to be to compromise william 
reinsch a steel trade expert and aide to sen john heinz rpa 
said tuesday heinz cochairman of the senate steel caucus has 
been pushing for an extension of the import barriers in their 
current form 
the american iron and steel institute an industry group said in 
a news release that the administration is expected to announce its 
decision this week 
pressured by congress the reagan administration negotiated 
fiveyear productbyproduct voluntary restraint agreements in 
1984 with 29 nations including japan south korea brazil and the 
european community to limit the flow of steel into the united states 
three days before last novembers election bush pledged to renew 
the restraints in some form but with the steel industry newly 
profitable opponents of the curbs led by a coalition of 
steelusing us manufacturers concerned about high steel prices 
say they can make a case for ending the program or at least 
narrowing its scope 
if the program is continued opponents are hoping it will be for 
less than five years and will allow new exemptions for 
manufacturers who claim the program has left them with inadequate 
steel supplies 
i suppose i could live with a compromise sen bob packwood 
rore a leading opponent of the restraint program said last week 
bushs decision will cap months of lobbying that has included a 
steel industry consultant gathering information on a rival group and 
planting questions with proimport quota lawmakers for use during 
congressional hearings according to an american iron and steel 
institute memorandum obtained by the associated press 
the may 25 memorandum described the work of the public relations 
firm oglivy amp mather which has been lobbying on behalf of extending 
the import restraints 
the memorandum said the firm planted questions for house and 
senate committee members to ask administration trade officials and 
gathered information on our opponents namely a coalition of 
us manufacturers opposed to continuing the curbs 
reinsch heinzs aide said he saw nothing wrong with the firm 
offering questions to members we take questions from all 
sources he said we wont always use them but its the 
quickest simplest way to get the lobbyists perspective 
the firm said it gathered information on the manufacturers group 
simply to find out who its members were and how much steel the group 
purchased

the daiwa dealer said the bank of japan sold 500 million to 600 
million during the day in efforts to check the us currencys rise 
but the intervention was absorbed as the dollar was rising so there 
was little impact he added 
on the stock exchange daiwa banks kenji ishizuka said the 
plunge resulted from political concerns and the yens fall 
seventy percent of the fall stems from politicians inability 
to resolve their problems he said 
ishizuka said shares such as highspeed linearmotor car related 
issues that are not affected by the exchange rate and interest rates 
received particular attention from investors 
volume traded in the first section totaled 600 million shares up

haulers today one day after a judge ordered an end to wildcat 
strikes by 43000 miners in nine states

comply with the federal judges order but miners have ignored 
similar orders in the past 
there were no immediate reports of strikers heeding the order 
but most began their traditional twoweek summer vacations this 
week

during protests in beijing for democracy chinese 
students in california demonstrated the growing power of the humble 
fax machine by using it to bypass censorship and send information 
into china 
the machines were made naturally in japan 
faxes once pricey snailpaced curiosities have become a basic 
necessity in offices around the world and a source of profits for 
japanese electronics companies 
although fax machines were invented in the west it was japanese 
companies that perfected and popularized them in a repeat of their 
success with a host of other products originally developed overseas 
more than 20 japanese companies now produce almost all the 
worlds facsimile machines a market estimated at 35 billion a 
year us firms that once made them have become mere middlemen 
putting their name on equipment manufactured in japan 
american companies dont seem interested in making faxes 
themselves said toshikasu hori of matsushita graphic 
communications maker of panasonic faxes theyre more interested 
in buying japanesemade machines to sell under their own brand 
names 
japans domination of the market reportedly spared faxes from 
inclusion this spring in a list of japanese products being 
considered by washington for punitive tariffs in response to alleged 
restrictive trading practices in japan the reason tariffs would 
hurt american consumers without benefiting any american producers 
with the worlds market open to them japanese fax makers are 
waging a fierce battle among themselves for rapidly increasing sales 
the battle illustrates the way japanese companies have come to 
dominate markets in the past for such products as transistor radios 
and videotape recorders 
it may look like an orchestrated push by japan inc when japanese 
companies enter an overseas market with priceslashing heavy 
advertising and a flurry of product introductions but underneath 
there is cutthroat competition among japanese firms for market share 
and razorthin initial profits 
the competition has brought down prices and speeded the 
introduction of sophisticated features into lowerpriced models 
says satoshi aoki of ricoh co which shares the market lead with 
matsushita 
ten years ago fax machines made in the united states took up to 
six minutes to transmit a page now technological advances 
particularly in semiconductor image sensors digitization and 
microprocessors the brains of the machines have reduced 
transmission time to as little as three seconds and the price for 
slower basic models to as low as 500 
at those prices a fax message often costs less than a letter 
even to another country and much less than overnight delivery 
service 
weve virtually stopped sending letters and use the fax 
instead says nobue hoshi a secretary at a radio production 
company its cheaper and much faster than a letter 
hori says japans lead in image sensor technology so far has kept 
out competition from asias newly industrialized economies south 
korea taiwan hong kong and singapore 
but weve had many korean and taiwanese visiting matsushita in 
the past year studying our production process he said 
analysts expect one and possibly both countries to enter the 
market later this year with lowpriced models in a repeat of 
patterns followed in other industries once dominated by japan 
that would intensify competition in the fastestgrowing market 
segment moderatepriced machines for smaller businesses 
about 22 percent of japans 57 million small businesses and 
stores with less than 10 employees now have faxes and the rate is 
expected to rocket to about 60 percent in three years hori says 
japan is expected to produce 42 million fax machines this year 
up 23 percent from last year of that about 12 million will be 
sold in japan and a similar amount in both north america and 
europe according to government forecasts 
the fax caught on quickly in this country partly because the 
complexity of the japanese writing system makes it difficult to use 
japanese in sending a message by telex or computer 
already japanese can use coinoperated fax machines at the 
neighborhood convenience store to order homedelivery noodles or 
pizza send a comment to a tv panel discussion show request prayers 
from a shrine for success in school entrance exams or obtain a 
detailed map of any part of japan 
in osaka the sakura taxi co offers faxequipped taxis for those 
who dont want to be out of touch with their offices coin faxes 
also are available in some train stations tour buses boats and 
japan airlines flights 
few japanese homes are faxequipped hori said there are still 
too few uses for a home fax he said not enough other people 
have them yet to make them worthwhile its still easier just to use 
the telephone 
but that will change over the next five years the matsushita 
executive said 
new models aimed at household use include a combination fax and 
answering machine that can recognize whether a human voice or 
another fax is on the other end of the phone line and respond 
accordingly 
some foreign businesses are using the japanese product to 
increase their sales in japan bypassing traditional distributors 
i couldnt live without it says paul maclardy owner of 
arise imports a washington dcbased fashion and antique exporter 
its amazing how many small businesses have faxes in japan we 
get a new piece of merchandise in and fax out a letter to about 20 
shops then the next day we generally get a fax back saying whether 
they want it he says 
while fax owners in the united states complain about a stream of 
junk faxes or unsolicited advertising messages japanese 
secretaries are reporting obscene faxes often dirty drawings 
arriving on their office fax machines

the governments chief economic forecasting 
gauge plunged 12 percent in may the biggest decline since the 
stock market crash in late 1987 the commerce department reported 
today 
the decline in the index of leading economic indicators was the 
third in the last four months as the gauge designed to foretell 
economic activity six to nine months into the future continued to 
flash strong signals of a significant decline in economic activity 
the 12 percent decline was significantly steeper than analysts 
had been expecting however economists generally believe the 
economy can escape a recession this year although they are looking 
for a major slowing in economic growth accompanied by rising 
unemployment 
the 12 percent drop in may followed a 06 percent gain posted in 
april the index had fallen 06 percent in march and 03 percent in 
february 
the may decline was the stepest since a 18 percent plunge in 
november 1987 that drop reflected the shock to the economy from the 
508point plunge in the dow jones index of 30 industrial stocks on 
oct 19 1987 
at the white house spokesman marlin fitzwater attemptged to put 
the may report in a positive light saying the economy is healthy 
and growing at a slower pace which means less pressure on inflation 
and interest rates we still think that the economy is in very good 
shape 
the april increase had allowed the index to steer clear of the 
traditional signal of a forthcoming recession three declines in a 
row but the may report added to the overall downward trend this 
year that has worried many economists 
todays index figure reinforced recent government and private 
industry reports that show almost every sector of the economy 
contracting because of the federal reserve boards efforts to raise 
interest rates to control inflation 
for instance only two of the 11 forwardlooking business 
statistics that make up the composite index higher stock prices 
and increased building permits pointed upward in may 
the others pointed down a drop in the money supply lower prices 
for sensitive materials indicating slower demand the fourth 
consecutive drop in an index measuring consumer confidence faster 
vendor deliveries meaning declining demand a shorter average work 
week fewer orders for plants and equipment a decrease in 
manufacturers unfilled orders higher initial claims for jobless 
benefits and a decrease in manufacturers unfilled orders 
the various changes left the index at 1438 percent of its 1982 
base of 100 so far this year the index has declined at an annual 
rate of 20 percent compared with an increase of 45 percent for 
all of 1988 
there have been signs recently the fed has relaxed its grip 
slightly but the effects remain some economists fear that unless 
the central bank eases more the economy could be pushed into a 
recession 
were still looking for a soft landing without a recession but 
were keeping our fingers crossed said david wyss senior 
financial economist at data resources inc in lexington mass 
said tuesday 
lawrence chimerine senior economic adviser for the wefa group in 
bala cynwyd pa said i still think well avoid a recession but 
the data probably is a little weaker than any of us had expected 
economist james annable of first national bank of chicago sees 
the economy slowing dramatically but without sliding into a 
recession 
in advance of todays report most economic forecasters were 
predicting the index would give up its april gain if not more 
but they thought the economy now in its seventh year of 
expansion would continue to grow although slightly this year 
chimerine described 1989 as a transition into a long period of 
fairly slow growth somewhere between 1 percent and 2 percent 
annable said we will see real economic growth for the rest of 
the year of more than 2 percent 
wyss who predicts a soft economy for the remainder of the year 
is looking for just over a 12 percent growth rate during the 
second half of 1989 
and the latest monthly survey of 51 top economists conducted by 
the blue chip economic indicators newsletter put the consensus 
growth forecast this year at 27 percent down significantly from 
gross national product growth of 39 percent in 1988

a federal appeals court panel ruled wednesday 
that trans world airlines inc had not bargained in bad faith to 
precipitate and prolong a strike by flight attendants in 1986 
members of the independent federation of flight attendants went 
on strike march 17 1986 after carl icahn who had taken control of 
twa bargained unsuccessfully for costsaving concessions from the 
union after a federal mediator could not resolve differences icahn 
cut flight attendants wages by 22 percent increased working hours 
and changed rules 
twa hired 2700 new flight attendants to replace strikers about 
1300 attendants resigned from the union and continued to work on 
may 17 1986 the union offered unconditionally to return to work 
without a contract 
the union later went to court accusing twa of bargaining in bad 
faith and seeking reinstatement to jobs lost in the strike and back 
pay at prestrike rates 
us district court judge howard sachs granted twas motion to 
dismiss the unions claim and his decision was upheld by a 
threejudge panel of the 8th us circuit court of appeals in his 
ruling sachs chastised both sides for sometimes angry and abrasive 
negotiations but said twas actions were legal responses to 
economic conditions 
i cannot conclude from the evidence presented that twas 
bargaining was in bad faith sachs said in a 78page ruling 
sachs said the law permits an aggressive union to bargain for 
benefits that will increase an employers costs and that an 
aggressive employer can lawfully bargain for reduction in total 
expenses of a group thought to be considerably overpaid and much 
less productive than is feasible 
sachs made reference to allegedly sexist remarks made by icahn 
saying they were made when he was engaged in debating and 
apparently became angry or lacked the sophistication to realize he 
was likely to antagonize rather than convince 
there has been no persuasive showing that sex stereotyping 
governed or influenced icahns economic demands only his 
rationalizations sachs said

selling analysts said 
news that protesting brazilian soybean producers may temporarily 
resume sales to processors as part of a governmentrequsted 10day 
coolingoff period prompted further selling of soybeans 
especially for nearterm delivery 
but rain is expected to continue in the southern mississippi 
valley where soggy field conditions have brought harvesting of soft 
red winter wheat to a standstill 
the wheat is not coming to market its not going out for 
export its not going to mills and they are starting to have some

on statistics collected for their areas 
the other five posted various increases the economies of san 
diego houston and miami showed the most improvement while los 
angeles and detroit displayed more moderate strength

in san diego houston and miami by comparison retail sales 
declined on average for all the cities studied while employment 
increased 
san diegos gains in retail sales and employment were the highest 
of all the cities 
houstons economy improved for the fifth straight quarter

energy futures prices tumbled in moderate trading 
wednesday as investors took profits from what analysts said was an 
overpriced market 
on the new york mercantile exchange the august contract for west 
texas intermediate the benchmark grade of us crude oil fell 45 
cents to finish at 2003 cents per barrel the august contract had 
risen 77 cents over the previous two sessions 
contracts for later delivery of west texas intermediate posted 
smaller decreases 
among refined petroleum products traded on the exchange the july 
contract for unleaded gasoline plunged 253 cents to 6115 cents a 
gallon heating oil for july skidded 122 cents to 4931 cents a 
gallon product prices for delivery after july also eased 
analysts attributed wednesdays declines to a temporary 
correction after recent steep gains 
peoplehave been skeptical of the recent rise so they sold it 
out today taking profits said john hill energy broker with 
merrill lynch energy futures 
paving the way for wednesdays declines was an industry report 
showing crude oil supplies rose last week some traders said 
the american petroleum institute reported that crude oil supplies 
rose 22 million barrels from the previous week to 3424 million 
barrels heating oil stocks also rose by more than 1 million barrels 
to 988 million 
although the api report showed a 13 millionbarrel decline in 
gasoline stocks to 2193 million analysts said prices were 
continuing a correction from mays sharp rise following the alaska 
oil spill and reports of tight supplies due to new octane 
requirements 
crude oil prices for august had risen 117 a barrel since last 
wednesday the day after the july contract expired surprising many 
analysts several factors contributed to the rise including a 
report that kuwait was lowering its oil production closer to the 
level desired by the organization of petroleum exporting countries 
kuwait previously had rejected its opecimposed production 
ceiling and set its own quota 
also driving prices higher this week were reports that put opec 
output last month at below 20 million barrels a day down from 
previous estimates in excess of 205 million barrels opecs 
selfimposed quota is 195 million

the house voted wednesday to begin construction 
on a giant super collider particle accelerator rivaling the 
washington beltway in size over objections that the nation cant 
afford the 5 billion supertoy president bush wants for his home 
state 
on a 33093 vote the house rejected an amendment by three 
northern members that would have struck 110 million from an 
appropriations bill to break ground on the 53milelong tunnel 25 
miles south of dallas 
the amendment to delay construction of the collider was offered 
to an 185 billion energy and water appropriations bill for fiscal 
1990 that also includes 636 million quadruple this years 
spending for environmental cleanups at the nations nuclear 
weapons plants 
the bill also finances the beginning of construction on 40 new 
water projects 37 by the army corps of engineers and three by the 
interior departments bureau of reclamation but limits total water 
project spending to 415 billion slightly less than what is being 
spent this year 
passed later on a voice vote the bill is the first spending 
measure to be passed by either house since bush assumed the 
presidency 
the administration opposed the new water project construction 
starts complaining they will require nearly 1 billion in federal 
funds over the next several years and claiming that many of them 
are not economic 
white house budget director richard g darman also complained 
that bill erodes water project costsharing requirements adopted by 
congress in 1986 but the white house refrained from making any veto 
threats over it 
on the super collider the administration lobbied heavily 
wednesday against the amendment by reps david obey dwis dennis 
eckart dohio and sherwood boehlert rny to delay construction 
the machine is called the superconducting super collider or ssc 
because its electromagnets will be cooled to near absolute zero 
temperature where energywasting resistance to electrical current 
vanishes 
the ssc is a critical part of this administrations initiative 
to strengthen the position of the nation as a world leader in 
science and technology the white house said in a policy 
statement it will produce discoveries innovations and spinoffs 
that could touch profoundly on every american 
bush had sought 250 million in initial construction and other 
money for the project which the energy department decided before 
last years presidential election to build in texas following an 
intense competition for it by more than half of the nations 50 
states 
earlier this month the president pleaded with key house members 
to protect the project from cuts in science energy and water 
programs being made as part of a deficitreduction agreement 
nonetheless the house appropriations committees energy and 
water development subcommittee trimmed bushs super collider request 
to 200 million including 110 million for beginning construction 
we feel this will be adequate to get the project under way 
rep tom bevil dala the subcommittees chairman said wednesday 
as time goes on this would become more expensive 
the energy department has estimated the cost at 58 billion 
expressed as the sum of the annual expenditures needed or the 
equivalent of 44 billion set aside in an interestbearing account 
in 1988 to pay for everything the congressional budget office has 
estimated it will cost at least 64 billion by the time it is 
completed in 1999 
opponents led by obey and eckart expressed fears that once 
construction is under way the project will absorb 800 million to 
900 million of the 11 billion that the government spends annually 
on all general nondefense scientific research eckart said he 
believed the cost could reach 12 billion 
were beginning to leverage this project into the budget at a 
cost to other science programs obey complained but the 
president indicates hes opposed to additional revenues if were 
going to have these expensive toys we ought to pay for them 
when completed the super collider would be the most powerful and 
most advanced accelerator in the world for studying subatomic 
particles in the quest for what is matter whirling beams of 
protons into each other with energies 20 times what is possible 
today scientists believe they will be able to duplicate for the 
first time in an almost infinitesimally small volume the 
conditions of the postulated big bang moment of creation 
while its difficult to predict now where the ssc will lead us 
we do know that past scientific and technological breakthroughs have 
had enormous impact on our daily lives said rep martin frost 
dtexas major advances in medicine agriculture computers and 
lasers have come about because of our nations commitment to basic 
scientific research

coffee futures prices posted solid gains wednesday on slim hopes 
for an international compromise to avert a collapse of the markets 
26yearold pricesupport machinery 
the market feels that producers and consumers are working to 
pull the proverbial rabbit out of the hat said arthur stevenson 
a coffeemarket analyst with prudentialbache securities inc in new 
york 
on other markets gasoline futures plunged platinum futures fell 
sharply corn and wheat futures advanced and livestock and meat 
futures were mixed 
green unroasted coffee settled 35 cent to 32 cents higher on 
new yorks coffee sugar amp cocoa exchange with the contract for 
delivery in july at 11438 a pound 
the rally represented a significant rebound from the 11monthlow 
of 111 a pound reached monday when it appeared the international 
coffee organization was headed for the junk heap 
the ico formed in 1963 is composed of 74 major coffee producing 
and consuming countries it tries to stabilize coffee prices by 
limiting sales of green coffee beans by the producers to the 
consumers 
the groups current 6year agreement expires on sept 30 and 
members have been unable to agree on a new pact 
the catalyst for mondays collapse was colombias stated 
intention to move for the abolition of all export quotas unless the 
organizations members approve one of two proposals for a new 
agreement at their scheduled meeting in london on monday analysts 
said neither proposal appeared to have enough support to succeed 
but on wednesday the eve of a scheduled meeting of the icos 
executive board rumors flew that colombia was seeking to postpone 
the crucial vote while seeking a compromise with brazil the worlds 
largest coffee producer colombia is the secondlargest producer 
the key issues in the debate include demands by consumer nations 
for more shipments of mild arabica coffees the type most in demand 
in north america and europe and for tighter controls on discount 
sales of coffee to nonico members 
some unleaded gasoline futures plunged the permitted 
2centsagallon limit on the new york mercantile exchange following 
the latest weekly american petroleum institute report which showed 
a 13 percent increase in refinery activity 
but the api report also showed a 13million barrel drop in us 
gasoline supplies last week and many analysts said the markets 
collapse was less a reaction to the report than a technical 
correction following substantial gains in six of the previous seven 
sessions 
crude oil and heating oil futures also ended lower 
west texas intermediate crude settled 27 cents to 45 cents lower 
with august at 2003 a barrel heating oil was 122 cents to 157 
cents lower with july at 4931 cents a gallon unleaded gasoline was 
156 cents to 253 cents lower with july which has no daily price 
limit at 6115 cents a gallon 
platinum futures plummeted in a selloff sparked by early japanese 
selling in the wake of the dollars sharp rise against the japanese 
yen gold and silver posted only slight losses 
platinum settled 1080 to 11 lower on the new york merc with 
july at 50360 a troy ounce on new yorks commodity exchange gold 
settled 10 cents to 60 cents lower with august at 37920 an ounce 
silver was 24 cents to 25 cents lower with july at 5285 an ounce 
most corn and wheat futures posted moderate gains on the chicago 
board of trade partly in reaction to forecasts for weather 
detrimental to those crops 
wheat settled cent lower to 4 cents higher with july at 412 
a bushel corn was 2 cents to 3 cents higher with july at 264 a 
bushel oats were 2 cents to 3 cents lower with july at 150 a

purchase agreement with hotel officials 
creditors hold a 65 million mortgage on three atlantis parking 
lots they requested the judges order to prevent the state casino 
control commission a stateappointed conservator and elsinor shore 
associates owners of the property from transferring the property 
to trump 
the judge had scheduled a hearing for thursday to consider 
whether to extend the restraining order 
the nakash brothers bid could be attractive to state gaming 
regulators and not only because it is higher many casino 
regulators including the atlantis stateappointed conservators 
have expressed concern about allowing more of atlantic citys casino 
and hotel industry to be owned by trump 
trump has said he would close the casino and convert it into a 
luxury hotel 
trump owns two atlantic city casinos and has a third under 
construction if he buys the atlantis it would give him control of 
34 percent of atlantic citys casino hotel rooms 31 percent of 
casino floor space and revenue and 48 percent of casino meeting and 
exhibition space according to state statistics 
new jersey gaming regulators have approved trumps bid and his 
lawyer has said the closing on the sale is set for july 7 pending 
the outcome of court action 
in april the atlantis became the first new jersey casino to fail 
to win approval of its regular license renewal since legal casino 
gambling began in atlantic city in 1978 the state ordered the 
casino to shut last month ruling that the gaming halls financial 
situation was too marginal to allow it to continue operations 
nakash who lives in manhattan said he and his brothers own 
several hotels including the guest quarters in houston and two 
hotels in israel the family also owns an american shipping line 
that operates tankers and bulk carriers under the liberian and 
panamanian flags

an advertising executive known as one of the 
industrys authorities on print media charged in a 75 million 
lawsuit wednesday that a manhattan ad agency fired him because he 
stutters 
david c lehmkuhl 42 was fired in march from his 
125000ayear position at ammirati amp puris inc after four months 
on the job according to the suit which was filed in state supreme 
court in manhattan 
during an afternoon meeting in his office edward vick the 
firms president told lehmkuhl he was being fired because we 
cant have you getting any closer to the clients the suit said 
lehmkuhl is seeking 5 million in compensatory damages from 
ammirati amp puris and 25 million in punitive damages 
the plaintiffs attorney barry r fischer said i think this 
will be a test case in the sense that this is a fairly highranking 
high executive in an industry a wellknown person and 
wellcompensated person who has been discriminated against in an 
obvious way 
vick said in a telephone interview that lehmkuhl was fired for 
not performing he would not comment on lehmkuhls stuttering 
the whole case is so far off base and so without merit there 
is almost no point in getting into a discussion of the specifics 
he said adding that his company intended to vigorously defend the 
case 
lehmkuhl is described in a december 1987 issue of marketing amp 
media decisions a media trade journal as one of the ad industrys 
most influential authorities on print media 
he worked for 18 years at the advertising firm n w ayer inc 
before being recruited by ammirati amp puris the suit said as senior 
vice president at ayer he earned 90000 plus a 10000 bonus in 
1988 and had 35 to 40 people reporting to him the suit said 
he was assigned to many of the agencys most prestigious 
accounts including atampt procter amp gamble gillette and ralston 
purina it said 
jean connolly a member of lehmkuhls media staff at ayer was 
quoted by marketing amp media decisions as saying he is brilliant 
he has a hard time communicating his ideas verbally but he still 
has this incredible reputation behind the scenes talk about unsung 
heroes 
fischer said in a telephone interview that his client tended to 
have top subordinates do presentation type work but there was no 
evidence that it held him back in any way his career speaks for 
itself that he has come a tremendous way despite his disability 
according to the suit lehmkuhl decided to leave ayer when 
ammirati puris offered him a 125000ayear position as senior vice 
president and director of media services as well free use of a bmw 
a 10000 bonus and eligibility to participate in the executive 
bonus pool beginning in 1989 
the suit says vick had met with lehmkuhl more than once prior to 
hiring him and was aware that he stuttered 
during his first week on the job vick invited him to lunch it 
proved to be the turning point in their relationship according to 
the suit 
under the stress of the new job mr lehmkuhls stutter was 
more readily apparent it said 
the moment his disability manifested itself vick immediately 
shunned mr lehmkuhl and refused to offer even a modicum of 
cooperation in trying to reasonably accommodate mr lehmkuhls 
disability 
lehmkuhl took steps to improve his speech he signed up for 
speech therapy classes and a publicspeaking course the suit said 
on march 15 he was fired 
fischer said his client is currently a selfemployed consultant 
in the media business making a fraction of what he used to earn

queen elizabeth ii and queen beatrix of the 
netherlands were not amused by getting stuck in london traffic 
wednesday night along with thousands of other commuters caught by a 
24hour subway and rail strike 
two businessmen in bowler hats tried waterskiing to work on the 
thames but not even a police escort could get the two monarchs to a 
700yearold church on time for an ecumenical service 
the 24hour strike which prime minister margaret thatcher called 
absolutely disgraceful idled all railroads and nearly the 
entire london subway system it was the second big transit strike in 
a week and the eighth walkout in 12 weeks by london underground 
workers 
elizabeth and beatrix were 15 minutes late at the dutch church in 
londons financial district but the service marking three centuries 
since william of orange of holland and his english wife mary took 
the english throne did not start without them 
the church was founded in 1253 and rebuilt after being bombed in 
world war ii 
police outriders tried to clear the traffic but there was 
nowhere to clear it a buckingham palace spokesman said anyone 
traveling on the roads this evening would be in a similar state 
transport secretary paul channon said the strike was utterly 
intolerable he said the government would not get involved and 
urged all parties to seek independent arbitration 
transit employees staged the walkout to press their demands for 
higher wages they threatened to hold another strike july 5 
employers reported more workers reached their offices than on 
jan 21 when londons bus drivers and conductors joined subway and 
railroad employees in the earlier walkout 
the confederation of british industry estimated 75 percent of 
london workers showed up at their jobs compared with 60 percent 
last week 
people were lulled into a false sense of security because the 
traffic was so light last week so more people have tried to get in 
this time said jane calvertlee london regional director of the 
confederation 
people have been leaving home as early as 4 am she said 
london buses were crowded but operating normally and traffic 
congestion was heavy extra buses were running from heathrow and 
gatwick airports into the city and special buses took thousands of 
tennis fans from central londons victoria station to wimbledon in 
southwest london 
a skeleton service of 26 trains was operating on three of the 
subway systems 10 lines with workers who oppose the strikes 
two businessmen hoping to avoid the choked streets of londons 
financial district traveled instead on the lesscongested river 
thames by water skis 
but their unconventional journey from putney south london came 
to an inauspicious end when river police told them that water skiing 
was forbidden on the thames 
when we stopped them they just sank into the water suits and 
all their bowlers bobbing off down the river said constable fred 
minnie one of two officers in the police boat which stopped the 
businessmen near westminster bridge 
it was quite a sight they said theyd had a bit of trouble 
getting to work last week on the day of the strikes so decided to 
water ski today and didnt realize it wasnt allowed 
the river bus partnership which operates river taxis on the 
thames said it expected to carry 5000 passengers or five times 
its normal load 
the royal mail said there would be some disruptions in service 
because 70 percent of the countrys mail is carried by trains it 
said extra trucks were rented to help the postal services own 
34000 vehicles 
the national union of railwaymen is striking to protest the 7 
percent wage hike offered its 75000 members by british rail 
the 10500 subway workers want a 99 weekly increase to operate 
trains without guards management is offering 46 plus 14 days extra 
annual vacation but is tying the raise to increase productivity 
about 27 million passengers use the london underground daily and 
2 million use rail services

conditional illusory nature of the offer by the two canadian 
firms behind dd acquisition unicorp canada corp and cara 
operations ltd

a group of house republicans introduced 
legislation wednesday to delay implementation of major provisions of 
medicares new catastrophic illness protections including a 
controversial income tax surcharge 
rep harris fawell rill who instigated the legislation 
acknowledged an uphill fight in getting the measure considered by 
the full house however the ways and means committee must send the 
measure to the floor if a majority of house members 218 sign a 
petition demanding such action 
the fawell bill which has 25 sponsors is identical to a measure 
by sen john mccain rariz that failed to pass the senate by one 
vote 
the congressional budget office estimates that a little under 40 
percent of the 33 million americans eligible for medicare have 
enough income to subject them to the surtax and that only 56 
percent are financially well off to be liable for the maximum tax 
for about 60 percent of those eligible for medicare the only 
additional charge for the expanded catastrophic protection is 4 a 
month 
senate finance committee chairman lloyd bentsen dtexas has 
scheduled hearings to consider reducing the surtax which could be 
as much as 800 this year for upperincome people over 65 
the hearings also will consider whether to make participation in 
the catastrophic illness program and thus payment of the surtax 
voluntary rather than mandatory 
house ways and means chairman dan rostenkowski dill opposes 
any changes in the new program which took effect jan 1 president 
bush also opposes any changes 
white house spokesman marlin fitzwater said wednesday that bush 
doesnt want the surtax rolled back despite estimates that it may 
collect 4 billion more than needed 
the program is just starting fitzwater said we dont know 
whether that excess will hold up or not the first year is 
probably not the time to tamper with a program of this magnitude 
when you dont really have realworld experience 
proponents argue that much of the criticism stems from the fact 
that the surtax is being collected in advance to build up a trust 
fund from which benefits are to be paid

a federal appeals court on wednesday reversed a 
lower court ruling that had granted more than 800 million to the 
state of south dakota in a federal antitrust claim against kansas 
city southern industries inc 
the 8th us circuit court of appeals said south dakota had no 
standing to assert the federal antitrust action 
about 600 million of the 8442 million represented a trebled 
jury verdict of 200 million on the antitrust claim the rest was an 
award to south dakota on claims that kansas city southern and its 
chief subsidiary the kansas city southern railway co interfered 
with a contractual relationship 
a us district court jury made the award in sioux falls sd 
in april 1988 the jury agreed with the states claim that the 
kansas city southern railway had conspired with other railroads to 
block a coal slurry pipeline proposed by energy transportation 
systems inc the railroad company based in kansas city appealed 
the award 
etsi was created during the early 1970s by a number of 
corporations to build a slurry pipeline through which coal could be 
transported from mining sites in northcentral states to utility 
companies in southcentral states the project was begun in response 
to the energy crisis at the time 
coal slurry is a mixture of roughly half coal and half water 
consequently large quantities of water were required to operate the 
pipeline 
south dakotas contract with etsi to supply the pipeline with 
water would have brought the state 9 million a year in revenue 
the states lawsuit claimed that kansas city southern and others 
violated federal antitrust laws in delaying the 1400mile 38 
billion pipeline which would have crossed railroad tracks 
attorneys for the state produced a document that said kansas city 
southern was designated to be the lead railroad to fight the project 
and the water sale 
the railroad argued that it opposed the pipeline but that there 
was no conspiracy the company also contended the project was 
financially doomed with or without south dakota water contracts 
in its opinion the appeals court said the judgment of the 
district court should be vacated on the grounds that 1 the state of 
south dakota had no standing to bring the antitrust claim and 2 the 
evidence fails to show that kcs improperly interfered with the south 
dakota district contract through the petitioning activities 
occurring after december 1981 
kansas city southern in a statement hailed the decision 
this removes a cloud that has hung over the company and its 
business operations since the return of the jury verdict in april 
1988 said landon h rowland president and chief executive 
officer 
south dakota gov george mickelson said he would have to read the 
ruling before deciding which of three options the state will pursue 
the state could do nothing ask the full court of appeals to review 
the panels ruling or apply directly for a hearing before the us 
supreme court he said 
mickelson said he was extremely disappointed with the ruling he 
said south dakota intended to use the money from the etsi water sale 
to support water development projects 
we pursued the etsi damages in an attempt to right a wrong done 
to south dakotans in our development of one of our most valuable 
resources water the governor said in a statement

the captain of a greek tanker that 
spilled 420000 gallons of heating oil into narragansett bay was 
arrested and charged wednesday with violating the federal clean 
water act and refuse act 
the captain iakovas georgudis 43 surrendered and was charged 
promptly in federal court in providence to ensure that he would 
remain in this country said us attorney lincoln almond 
each of the two misdemeanor counts carries up to a year in prison 
and 100000 fine or double the actual damages which the coast 
guard has estimated at 16 million 
the clean water act prohibits the negligent discharge of 
pollutants the refuse act prohibits unlawfully discharging refuse 
into navigable water without a permit 
in a hearing on a second spill on the delaware river the pilot 
and captain of an uruguayan tanker testified that the ships anchor 
was dropped too soon causing the vessel to run aground and leak 
more than 310000 gallons of oil 
painstaking cleanup continued on that spill while workers using 
handheld skimmers were close to finishing the cleanup of 250000 
gallons of crude spilled when a third tanker collided with a barge 
in texas soiling a milelong stretch of galveston bay shoreline 
all three spills occurred within hours of each other over the 
weekend 
in rhode island us magistrate jacob hagopian set bail for 
georgudis at 50000 and ordered the captain to surrender his 
passport and remain on the ship until bail is paid 
georgudis also was subpoenaed to appear at a statewide grand jury 
wednesday that is investigating possible violations of state 
pollution laws and a statute that requires ships within narragansett 
bay to have harbor pilots on board but he did not testify said 
state attorney general james oneil 
his attorney indicated he was going to exercise his privilege 
against selfincrimination oneil said georgudis declined to 
answer questions as he ran into the courthouse followed by his 
attorney peter dibiase 
in interviews with coast guard officials and rhode island gov 
edward d diprete after the spill georgudis admitted he made a 
mistake in not taking on a pilot to escort the vessel into the 
harbor 
diprete said after meeting with president bush in washington late 
tuesday that bush pledged the federal government would pay all state 
cleanup expenses officials reported earlier this week however 
that most of the oil has evaporated 
the governor said wednesday most shellfish beds closed in upper 
narragansett bay after the accident would reopen thursday federal 
food and drug administration tests showed no contamination he said 
the reopening comes just before the july fourth weekend 
traditionally the most profitable time of year for shellfishermen 
further tests would be needed before the southernmost beds could be 
reopened diprete said 
at the philadelphia hearing into the delaware river spill pilot 
robert anderson said the transit of the 749footlong presidente 
rivera was normal and he started slowing down more than 10 miles 
below his destination the sun marketing and refining co refinery 
in marcus hook pa he said he told the captain to prepare for 
anchoring 
as we approached the intersection of marcus hook i suddenly 
saw sparks fly and i said jesus christ he didnt drop the 
anchor i saw thats what had happened anderson said at the 
coast guard inquiry 
i was waiting for the jerk of the anchor that would yank the 
ship they finally got it stopped and i felt we had hit something on 
the bottom we went through various maneuvers and got the help of 
two tugboats we were able to get off and heave the anchor up 
all of a sudden the ship hit bottom again and i heard it and 
i knew we were hard and fast one tugboat captain said he could see 
oil coming out at that point i said to the captain that we had to 
notify the coast guard he said 
speaking through an interpreter capt raul dibarrart said he 
told a lieutenant to prepare to drop the port anchor about 130 am 
saturday but before he knew it the anchor had begun to fall 
lt ricardo schunk the second officer on the tanker said the 
ships windlass a huge winch used to raise and lower the anchor 
was not engaged as it usually is when dropping anchor the botswain 
responsible for the windlass was not present he said 
the hearing was recessed until next wednesday 
hundreds of people have been working since the weekend to clean 
up the spilled oil which took the shape of greasy sticky blobs 
some as large as beach balls 
a coast guard spokesman said wednesday that cleanup crews were 
making headway sweeping the delaware river cooler weather kept oil 
blobs from melting into puddles that would soak into shorelines but 
wind shifts began to move oil to new jersey riverbanks for the first 
time 
in texas only about 40 of the 6000 barrels of oil that leaked 
from the barge in the houston ship channel remained on the water 
wednesday afternoon us coast guard spokesman william nash said 
its a slower process now because the larger machines cant be 
utilized with the smaller levels of oil nash said its more 
of a handson operation now 
testimony continued wednesday in a hearing being held to 
determine what caused the spill which occurred friday evening when 
the panamanian tanker turned into the barge near the intersection of 
the houston ship channel and the bayport ship channel

american investor t boone pickens prepared thursday 
to assert his rights as the largest shareholder in koito 
manufacturing co at the japanese auto lighting manufacturers 
annual shareholders meeting 
the stockholders meeting began at 10 am with pickens in 
attendance on several occasions hecklers disrupted koito president 
takao matsuuras opening remarks and his presentation of the 
companys annual report 
in a controversial deal that is challenging the insularity of the 
japanese corporate world pickens announced in march that he had 
bought 202 percent of koitos stock making him the companys 
largest shareholder which has close ties to toyota motor corp 
koito has refused pickens request for a seat on its board of 
directors saying it doubts his assertions that he is longterm 
investor with a genuine interest in helping manage the company 
pickens planned to present his case at the meeting held in tokyo 
meanwhile matsuura said wednesday he was worried gangsters might 
disrupt the gathering 
the national police agency said 5358 police are being sent to 
shareholders meetings scheduled thursday across japan to deal with 
sokaiya racketeers who regularly disrupt such meetings trying 
to extract payoffs from management to keep silent 
koito like more than 1300 other firms is expected to receive 
police protection for its meeting where japanese media plan heavy 
coverage in case of a management showdown with pickens 
pickens who has a reputation as a corporate raider in the 
united states planned a showdown at the meeting at least over the 
number if representatives he can bring into the gathering 
pickens purchase of koito stock sent shock waves through the 
japanese business community whose tradition is to consult with a 
firm before taking a major stake in its stock 
the texas oilman has argued that japanese shareholders should 
stand up for their rights which japanese critics agree are limited 
japanese businessmen agree that the interests of shareholders are 
often ignored in favor of those of management and employees 
although pickens arguments for shareholders rights have gained 
some support in leading newspaper editorials japanese with an eye 
to his string of unsuccessful hostile takeover attempts in the 
united states remain suspicious of his motives 
he has strongly denied however that his intention is greenmail 
the practice of buying a companys shares to force their 
repurchase at a higher price to maintain the companys management 
independence 
pickens has raised his problems with koito as a trade issue in 
washington saying americans are denied the right to invest freely 
in japan while japanese can easily purchase american companies 
it was not known whether sokaiya actually would show up at 
koitos meeting thursday but its a big worry said company 
president takao matsuura in a meeting with reporters wednesday 
japanese companies regularly pay off sokaiya so they wont 
disrupt shareholders meetings and sometimes hire them to silence 
complaints from other shareholders although the practice has been 
illegal since 1982 securities industry sources say it is still 
common and over the past several years a number of executives of 
major companies have been arrested for paying sokaiya 
koito officials say they have no ties with sokaiya koito is 
known as a company that has avoided contact with sokaiya said a 
former securities house executive in charge of dealing with the 
racketeers he spoke on condition of anonymity 
sources close to koito and securities industry sources say they 
dont think pickens himself has any ties to sokaiya either 
many industry sources are unwilling to comment on the record 
about sokaiya because they fear them or their associates however 
information on sokaiya is wellorganized with newsletters on their 
activities circulating among securities houses and businessmen who 
have to deal with them 
detailed directories and histories of sokaiyas activities 
charting their ties with yakuza japans organized crime gangs 
are bought by managers to determine how much attention to pay to 
pressure from a particular person claiming to be a sokaiya 
koito was informed that a number of people registered to attend 
its meeting were on a police list of known sokaiya said a source 
close to the company who refused to be further identified

an agreement to abandon the beleaguered 
shoreham nuclear power plant cleared its final hurdle wednesday when 
long island lighting co shareholders overwhelmingly approved the 
deal 
we must now come together and end the controversy lilco 
chairman william catacosinos urged about 600 shareholders at the 
companys annual meeting its hurt all of us too much 
gov mario cuomo who helped negotiate the deal called the 
shareholders action historic and said their approval allows 
lilco to devote itself exclusively in the future to providing safe 
and reliable energy for long island at the lowest possible cost 
the shareholders also approved the terms of a settlement of a 
classaction racketeerinfluenced and corrupt organizations act suit 
filed against the utility it calls for lilco to refund 390 million 
to ratepayers as adjustments in monthly bills over a 10year period 
under the agreement lilco will resume payment of dividends to 
its shareholders which were suspended in 1984 when the uncertainty 
over shoreham brought lilco to the brink of bankruptcy preferred 
stockholders dividends will be retroactive to 1984 
shareholder approval of the deal to abandon shoreham was the 
final step before the settlement between lilco and the state to 
close the 55 billion shoreham plant could take effect 
lilco is now expected to seek permission from the federal nuclear 
regulatory commission to sell shoreham for 1 to the long island 
power authority a state agency lipa will then seek approval from 
the nrc to dismantle the plant 
lilco was not guaranteed any rate increases in exchange for 
agreeing to sell the plant cuomo predicted when the deal was 
announced that any hikes would be probably less than 45 percent a 
year lilco customers already pay among the highest electric rates 
in the nation 
state and local officials contend the area around the plant 
about 50 miles east of new york city on densely populated long 
island could not be safely evacuated in the event of an accident 
it would be the the first time a completed nuclear power plant 
will be closed without ever going on line 
a preliminary tally of about 85 percent of lilco shareholders 
indicated that shareholders voted approximately 82 million to 3 
million to accept the deal according to lilco spokesman james lois 
however the deal could lead to a new round of battles since 
federal department of energy officials have stated that they intend 
to block the sale and transfer of shoreham for dismantling they 
contend the reactor should be mothballed so that it could be 
activated if necessary to meet energy needs in the future 
it was the second time within a year that lilco shareholders 
voted approval to the statelilco settlement to abandon the shoreham 
facility 
the earlier deal stalled in december when the state legislature 
refused to consider a portion of the agreement that required its 
approval the portion gave authority to the state power authority to 
build power plants on long island in place of shoreham to meet peak 
electricity demands 
the legislators charged that the rates provided for in the 
agreement put a burden unfairly on lilco customers 
under the revised 1989 settlement reached in february 
legislative approval is not required 
in april the nrc granted a full operating license for shoreham 
after nearly a decadelong struggle to obtain the permit shoreham 
had only been licensed to operate at up to five percent of full 
power 
suffolk county filed suit against lilco in 1986 under the rico 
statute charging that lilco had lied to the state public service 
commission about costs and progress of shoreham in order to obtain 
electric rate increases 
a federal jury in brooklyn convicted lilco making the company 
liable for billions of dollars an attorney for the ratepayers 
settled the case for 390 million

banc one corp of columbus ohio agreed 
wednesday to take over 20 failed banks of mcorp a dallas holding 
company in what analysts believe will be the third largest 
commercial bank escue in the nations history 
federal deposit insurance corp announced that banc one will be 
the new owner of the mcorp banks but refused to discuss details of 
the transaction before a news conference on thursday however 
private analysts believe the deal will involve a federal infusion of 
about 2 billion 
if the analysts are correct mcorp will become the third biggest 
bank failure ranking behind continental illinois of chicago in 1984 
and first republicbank of dallas in 1988 which required initial 
government pledges of 45 billion and 4 billion respectively 
the fdic which insures commercial bank deposits said that banc 
one will assume management of the failed banks effective july 5 and 
its chairman john b mccoy will assume the chairmanship of the 
mcorp banks under the name of bank one texas 
fdic spokesman alan whitney said banc one agreed in principal to 
invest 500 million in the new texas operation he declined to say 
how much the government is injecting the deal likely will become 
final in four to six weeks he said 
banc ones vice president for acquisitons bill boardman said in 
columbus it was not clear how much federal help or overall funds the 
deal would require the bank has made an estimate of the cost which 
he declined to disclose 
the fdic will take over problem loans and bring the balance 
sheet to a zero position he said 
banc one he added will manage banc one texas for 120 days 
identifying the problem loans and inflated assets before the 
purchase is completed 
banc one the 25th largest banking company in the nation with 
253 billion in assets has pioneered retail innovations and has 
been one of the five most profitable banks every year since 1984 
it was one of the first banks to offer automated tellers and it 
has been a leader in packaging credit card debt into securities for 
sale to investors it allocates more of its earnings to research and 
development than most banks 
unlike other large banks it has shunned participating in 
corporate buyout deals instead its bread and butter has been 
credit cards auto leasing and student loans still its had some 
missteps an effort to create a computerized home banking network 
fizzled 
with the texas acquisition banc one obtains an extensive branch 
network with offices in abilene austin houston fort worth dallas 
and other cities in the state 
since march 29 the failed mcorp banks have been government 
owned operating under the name of the deposit insurance bridge 
bank dallas that new entity was formed when regulators declared 20 
mcorp subsidiaries insolvent leaving five subsidiary banks still 
operating under the private ownership of the original holding 
company 
among the other prominent bidders for the failed mcorp banks were 
ncnb corp based in charlotte nc which bought first 
republicbank last year chemical banking corp the nations sixth 
largest banking company first city bancorp of houston itself the 
recipient of 1 billion federal bailout in 1987 and the new 
yorkbased leveraged buyout firm kohlberg kravis roberts amp co 
early on san franciscos wells fargo amp co had also been interested 
in the deal but did not bid 
in a written statement fdic chairman l william seidman said 
only that banc one had been selected in a highly competitive 
process from among attractive proposals 
kohlberg kravis said in a statement we are extremely 
disappointed weve spent an enormous amount of time resources and 
effort on this matter it noted that its proposal would have 
maintained an independent bank in texas 
buddy kemp chairman of ncnb texas the new name of first 
republicbank said his company was disappointed with the fdics 
decision but said we remain committed to serving the texas 
market by expanding our franchise throughout the state 
analysts have blamed mcorps failure on the collapse of the 
energy market even though the bank had focused more on real estate 
loans rather than energy loans the collapse of oil prices earlier 
in the 1980s snowballed into a real estate bust and a regional 
recession in the southwest 
seidman has said that mcorp is the agencys last major commercial 
bank problem remaining however the fdic also is reviewing bids for 
national bancorp of texas of san antonio and texas american 
bancshares inc of fort worth with combined assets of 7 billion 
they are likely to be sold in a package requiring in the 
neighborhood of 500 million in government assistance 
last year the fdic reported a postdepression record 221 bank 
failures and suffered its first loss since it was established in 
1934 with reserves dropping from 183 billion to 14 billion 
seidman has said he expects the fund to begin rebuilding its 
reserves this year
