soldiers at the us navy base at guantanamo 
cuba fired two shots thursday at cuban sentry posts breaking 
glass but causing no injuries the official news agency prensa 
latina said 
the news agency quoted a ministry statement as saying one shot 
was fired at 10 am est at sentry post 17 and a second at 1 pm 
at post 18 
lt cmdr ken satterfield a spokesman in washington for the 
pentagon said we received no reports of any such incident 
both shots shattered glass in the posts the agency said in the 
dispatch monitored in mexico the direction indicated the shots 
were fired from american post 13 the agency quoted the note as 
saying 
these actions are even more serious and of unpredictable 
consequences because the two shots hit the guardposts and could 
have wounded and even assassinated any of the soldiers who were on 
guard duty the agency quoted the note as saying 
the note said the last similar incident was aug 21 1987 when 
shots were fired from american post 18 on a cuban observation post 
it noted the incident occurred as the country was holding 
funerals for more than 2000 cuban soldiers and civilian 
technicians killed in angola and other foreign conflicts the past 
14 years 
the ministry said it was not an accident that these vulgar and 
dangerous provocations by yankee soldiers occurred precisely

state game officials are no dummies 
but the same cant be said for the deer they used to nab poachers 
for the second straight year officers from the states division 
of natural resources used fake deer against hunters who stop along 
highways to shoot at deer illegally 
last year one bogus buck in braxton county bamboozled 30 
wouldbe hunters into taking potshots this year conservation 
officers caught 82 shooters at two locations 
we were hoping that the publicity would act as a deterrent to 
those hunters who like to cruise the roads looking for deer said 
maj bill daniel of the agencys law enforcement division i 
think it worked im sure it saved some real deer 
most of the arrests were for shooting from the road or for 
trespassing on private property 
daniel said one decoy was set up in a privately owned field 
marked with no hunting signs 
we had some guys who would jump out of their cars run over to 
the fence and use the signs as gun rests daniel said 
such antics often left conservation officers laughing so hard 
that they had to pause to compose themselves before moving in to 
make arrests daniel still chuckles about one incident 
one car pulled up and four guys came rolling out of it with 
their guns he said three of them took up positions outside 
the fence while the other one sneaked in toward the decoy 
finally the guy got within 30 yards or so of the deer stood 
up and fired he looked at the decoy still just standing there 
and i think he began to get the idea that something was wrong 
he walked over to the decoy and just reached out and touched 
it about that time we hit the siren and moved in youve never 
seen a more dejected or more hangdog expression on anyone in your 
life his buddies were laughing their brains out

your runofthemill lounge lizard will 
still be roaming bars but the coggon city council intends to 
decide whether an undersized alligator can frequent a tavern 
a hearing will be held next month to discuss whether crosby the 
alligator can be the mascot of crosbys cove a tavern recently 
purchased by crosbys best friend and feeder jim schebler of cedar 
rapids 
tuesday night schebler lobbied the city council to amend the 
citys dangerous animal ordinance which prohibits bobcats polar 
bears alligators and other wild critters within the city limits 
council discussion showed a general reluctance to amend the 
ordinance to allow alligators less than 3 feet long if in a 
secured container 
but councilman richard foye supported the change agreeing with 
schebler that dogs could be more dangerous than a lockedup 
alligator 
im not worried about his alligator snipping off my kids 
toes foye said they shouldnt be in the tavern anyway 
mayor bob trumbull encouraged drafting the amendment and having 
a hearing jan 2 
schebler wants to keep the alligator now 2 feet long in the 
bar to attract customers

even minuscule amounts of cocaine can constrict 
the arteries and reduce the flow of blood to the heart and this 
may explain how larger doses trigger heart attacks and death 
researchers report today 
young seemingly healthy cocaine abusers sometimes suffer chest 
pain or heart attacks even though their heart arteries appear to be 
perfectly normal doctors have speculated that the drug causes 
spasms in blood vessels and temporarily chokes off the flow of 
blood to heart muscle 
the importance of our findings was showing that this indeed 
happens said dr l david hillis no one has shown it in man 
before 
cotton strips soaked in a cocaine solution are routinely used as 
a local anesthetic in an estimated 185000 medical procedures in 
the united states each year it is especially common during minor 
nose operations since it limits bleeding as well as deadens pain 
in their experiment on 45 people doctors tested cocaines 
effects on the heart when volunteers received doses that were about 
twothirds the amount used for anesthesia they got between 150 and 
180 milligrams of cocaine by contrast people who abuse cocaine 
typically take one gram or six times this much 
even that small dose caused coronary blood flow to fall by 
about 15 to 20 percent said hillis one can extrapolate from 
that to say that in all probability a much larger dose would in 
some people cause a very profound fall in blood flow 
the study conducted by hillis and colleagues at the university 
of texas southwestern medical center in dallas was published in 
the new england journal of medicine 
hillis said that despite the finding the medical use of cocaine 
as a painkiller is safe the volunteers showed no sign in their 
hearts of ischemia or oxygen starvation 
hillis said that some peoples heart arteries respond much more 
dramatically than others to the potential hazards of cocaine in 
his study he said the reduction in blood flow ranged from 5 
percent to about 40 percent 
he said these individual differences may explain why some people 
have heart attacks or die from cocaine abuse while most do not 
in an accompanying editorial drs jeffrey m isner and saurabh 
k chokshi of st elizabeths hospital in boston noted that during 
the past year the number of emergency room visits for 
cocainerelated problems has increased fivefold 
while laboratory studies offer increase insight into the 
fundamental effects of cocaine they wrote the history of this 
ancient drug grows progressively more depressing 
they said that at least 58 cases of cocainerelated heart 
attacks have been described in medical journals among highly 
publicized cases was the 1986 death of college basketball star len 
bias 
hillis said cocaine stimulates the bodys production of 
adrenaline and other hormones these trigger the blood vessels to 
narrow so that less oxygencarrying blood can get through at the 
same time the drug increases the hearts need for oxygen by 
boosting the heart rate

china plans to shut down 10 percent of its 
newspapers and publishing houses targeting for closure those 
printing pornography or material critical of the communist party 
the official xinhua news agency said today 
the agency quoted the current issue of china cultural news as 
saying newspaper and magazine offices that publish pornographic 
stories or articles running counter to the party line will lose 
their licenses 
the press and publications administration will also merge 
newspapers and periodicals that are similar in content it said 
the report said china has 1600 newspapers 3000 social science 
periodicals and 500 publishing houses many are similar in nature 
and have few readers 
in the past year particularly after communist leaders used 
troops to crush the prodemocracy movement in june the government 
has moved to consolidate and exert greater control over the 
publishing industry 
millions of publications have been confiscated and destroyed in 
a nationwide antipornography campaign and a number of publications 
that sympathized with the prodemocracy movement such as 
shanghais world economic herald have been shut down or revamped 
li ruihuan the politburo standing committee member in charge of 
propaganda and cultural affairs said recently that many 
publications were being turned out that advocated bourgeois 
liberalization or western ideas 
he said such publications were full of seductive and poisonous 
material especially harmful to young people and it was high 
time to solve all these problems

cervical cancer risks increase dramatically 
for women who fail to get pap smear tests at least every two years 
university of washington scientists report in a study released 
today 
women who get pap smears only every three years run a risk that 
is 39 times greater that cervical cancer will go undetected than 
women who have the test annually according to the study published 
in the professional journal obstetrics and gynecology 
the study said the risks increase as the betweentest interval 
increases and that for women who have no pap tests for 10 years or 
longer the risk increases by 123 times 
the study shows that women should get pap smears more 
frequently than every three years said dr joseph chu one of 
five physicians who conducted the study at the university of 
washington the risk of having advanced disease goes way down if 
the tests are conducted every two years or less 
chu said that the more frequent pap tests lower the cancer risk 
for all women no matter what other risk factors such as smoking 
or multiple sexual partners they have in their life 
the pap smear is used in gynecological screening to detect the 
presence of squamous cell cancer the most common form of cervical 
cancer it can also detect changes in cells that could lead to 
invasive cancer if not treated thus the test can result in 
therapy that prevents the cancer from developing 
to perform a pap test doctors collect cells from the mucous 
membrane of the cervix during a pelvic examination the cells are 
stained for laboratory analysis the procedure known formally as 
the papanicolaou stain test is named for george nicolas 
papanicolaou the physician who developed it 
just how frequently such tests should be performed to afford 
maximum protection has long been a matter of controversy some 
studies have found that significantly elevated risks for cancer 
occur at test intervals of four years or more 
but the washington state researchers said in their study that 
they found three years seemed to be the critical interval 
women with threeyear screening intervals had over three times 
the risk of squamous cells cervical cancer at did other women with 
annual screening intervals 
it noted however that there was little risk difference between 
annual and biannual pap tests 
we found no difference in the risk of cervical cancer between 
women screened every year and those screened every two years 
suggesting that twoyear screening intervals offer the same 
protection as annual smears said dr kirk shy lead author of 
the study 
the findings are based on interviews and medical histories of 92 
women with advanced cervical cancer compared with similar data 
from 178 women without cancer and selected randomly the ages 
ranged from 31 to 75 
annual pap tests are recommended by the american cancer society 
and the american college of obstetricians and gynecologists for 
women ages 18 and over who are sexually active after three 
consecutive tests with normal findings however the test often is 
done at the discretion of the physician 
there are really no firm guidelines chu said our study 
though shows that three years is certainly not the right number of 
years between tests 
the study showed that although the pap test frequency along 
with appropriate followup treatment can reduce the risk of 
squamous cell cancer the test interval had no effect on other 
types of cervical cancer squamous cell however accounts for 
about 85 percent of all cervical cancers chu said 
other researchers conducting the study were drs margaret 
mandelson benjamin greer and david figge 
obstetrics and gynecology is the professional journal of the 
american college of obstetricians and gynecologists

soviet president mikhail s gorbachevs 
toughened stance on submarinelaunched cruise missiles could delay 
completion of a strategic weapons treaty past the summit planned 
for june says a senior us official 
gorbachev and his foreign minister eduard a shevardnadze 
appeared at the malta summit last weekend to walk back from a 
concession they made in september concerning the submarinelaunched 
cruise missiles or slcms said a second official both sources 
spoke on condition of anonymity 
at a september meeting in wyoming with secretary of state james 
a baker iii shevardnadze withdrew soviet demands that slcm limits 
be included in the proposed strategic arms reduction treaty 
shevardnadze said the soviets would settle for a separate deal but 
did not specify whether it must be signed at the same time as the 
start treaty 
at malta however the soviets spelled out new more stringent 
conditions for the proposed slcm accord and they have been 
indicating that they want the two deals concluded simultaneously 
said the sources 
in september they said slcms could be dealt with outside the 
start treaty but gorbachev said how can we agree to all these 
kinds of reductions when slcms are out there running free said 
the official 
gorbachev also pressed president bush to hold naval arms control 
talks to ban shortrange nuclear weapons in the superpower navies 
said white house spokesman marlin fitzwater 
bush rejected gorbachevs suggestion as unacceptable to us 
because the united states is a naval power we depend upon the seas 
for contact with all of our allies and with other continents of the 
world fitzwater said 
gorbachev concentrated on the issue of tactical nuclear weapons 
while shevardnadze dealt in greater detail with the slcm question 
in a separate meeting with baker said one of the sources 
the senior us official said that as a result of the 
conflicting signals from wyoming and malta i dont know where we 
are but slcms is a major issue 
the new soviet position helps explain the sudden pessimism of 
us officials who went to malta hoping to conclude start in time 
for the summit scheduled for the last two weeks of june in the 
united states but left the mediterranean saying it could take 
longer 
both leaders said before the summit that a start deal was 
possible by september and at malta they announced that baker would 
travel to the soviet union next month to continue work on the 
treaty which would cut longrange superpower arsenals by 30 
percent to 50 percent to 6000 warheads apiece 
so far the soviets have not put forward a comprehensive 
proposal linking slcms and tactical nuclear weapons or spelling 
out the scope of the issues they want covered in naval arms control 
talks 
but at malta shevardnadze told baker the soviets wanted the 
slcm issue included in a naval arms control treaty that they 
wanted tough verification rules and they wanted to curb 
conventional and nuclear warheads said one source 
the soviets have been pushing similar conditions at the start 
talks in geneva and also have given indications that they want 
start and a naval treaty at the same time they didnt say that 
specifically at malta said the source 
one official described shevardnadzes statements at malta as a 
hardening of the soviet position another called it a walk 
back 
gorbachev illustrated his concern over the american navy by 
giving bush a map of us naval bases deployments and maneuvers 
around the soviet union 
in rejecting gorbachevs argument fitzwater said bush 
maintained that the soviet union is a landbased power but the 
navy is crucial to us in terms of maintaining all of our 
commitments around the world maintaining open sea lanes and 
commercial lanes around the world 
in pentagon and other assessments the us navy is considered 
to be mightier than its soviet counterpart having for example more 
aircraft carriers 
at the joint presidential news conference concluding the summit 
bush and gorbachev staked out their basic positions on naval arms 
control although neither went into detail 
the time has come when we should begin discussing naval 
forces gorbachev said 
bush replied im disinclined to think that this is an area 
where we will have immediate progress

with the cold war thaw the republican partys 
right wing is having a tougher time attracting troops and money to 
its conservative causes prompting a search for new issues to 
replace the soviet menace 
saber rattling and the sort of hardline anticommunism that 
have held our coalition together are not going to be as convincing 
arguments with the voters not when you have a majority of the 
voters thinking the soviet union merely seeks peace like we do 
said roger stone a republican political consultant 
richard viguerie who built a political and financial empire 
based on mailorder fundraising among conservatives says hes 
replacing anticommunism with attacks on congress as the 
centerpiece of his new appeals for dollars 
i plan to make the imperial congress my no 1 issue for the 
foreseeable future viguerie said whether its going to catch 
on as the no 1 issue i dont know 
not all conservatives have begun such wholesale rethinking 
however 
most prominent among them was vice president dan quayle who 
offered a highly skeptical assessment of the soviets in an 
interview published after last weekends summit between president 
bush and soviet president mikhail s gorbachev 
i dont think theyve changed much in foreign policy quayle 
told the washington post in a subsequent interview with 
knightridder newspaper editors quayle tempered his earlier 
comments by saying he should have referred to the soviet union as 
an authoritarian rather than totalitarian state 
national security adviser brent scowcroft rejected suggestions 
there was a marked difference in the views of bush and quayle 
he said that there may be a difference of perspective but 
theres no difference in the substance of the policies were 
pursuing 
sen malcolm wallop rwyo a leading senate hawk disputed the 
notion that gorbachevs perestroika reforms and the moves 
toward democracy in the soviet bloc nations of europe have resulted 
in a lessening of cold war concerns by american voters 
i dont think the millennia has arrived and i dont think the 
polls show the public thinks the millennia has arrived wallop 
said 
he is a leader of conservative efforts to oppose defense cuts 
attributable to the lessening of superpower tensions he is 
opposing bush administration acceptance of modest cuts in defense 
spending 
but wallop acknowledges that in the wake of changes in europe 
and the malta summit its going to require some leadership to 
maintain some perspective in the public mind in support of the 
conservative agenda 
the opening of the berlin wall and other rapid revolutionary 
changes in eastern europe are only the latest blows to 
conservatives ability to rally around cold war worries 
as conservatives have seen their presidential candidates win 
three consecutive elections and much of their agenda enacted by 
congress some of their leading organizations have faced a decline 
in fundraising and duespaying membership as they succeed some 
of the fire goes out of the fight 
our members came on because of defense and foreign policy 
issues anticommunism issues said dan casey executive 
director of the american conservative union 
the fear and loathing is just not at the same level of 
intensity it was in recent years you dont expand your 
membership pool by just declaring victory 
most of the conservative leaders say they believe there is still 
a good case to be made for maintaining tough defense and 
anticommunism positions their problem is most voters arent as 
concerned as before 
i find this all a very sorry state of affairs laments stone 
the acu illustrates the problem encountered by many conservative 
groups 
its donor list has fallen from a high of 750000 donors a decade 
ago to about 60000 today others such as the american security 
council have sold assets and cut back programs 
david keene chairman of the acu said his group is in an 
assessment phase and considering other issues 
and conservative leaders say there are many other ones 
including opposing latin communism as casey calls it in 
central america and even that favorite from 11 years ago 
maintaining control of the panama canal 
i dont see any perestroika south of the border casey said 
other potential fighting issues eyed by conservative 
fundraisers are opposing abortion pushing conservative social 
issues before the supreme court fighting taxes and opposing 
liberals on the spending at home of any savings accruing from peace 
abroad 
the center of gravity of the conservative movement will 
shift said casey i think the tax issue is a critical issue 
and the disposition of the peace dividend will ignite the usual 
liberalconservative fight 
wallop while insisting the cold war causes will still work 
acknowledges that rapid changes in the face of communism will force 
conservatives and liberals to change their methods 
its made it different its made it different for the other 
side too wallop said the will begin to find ways to spend 
the defense savings theyve got a pile of new thinking to do also 
all of us do

forgery of his fathers signature on the documents giving him the 
shares to make it appear that the transfer took place before 
rodolfo guccis death in 1983 the lower court said gucci was 
trying to evade inheritance taxes 
but the appeals court ruled wednesday that gucci and six others 
accused with him didnt commit the crime

scientists reported today they have discovered a 
gene for a protein that helps govern brain cell communication a 
potential step toward new treatments for stroke and severe head 
injury 
further work also may help explain how the brain learns and 
remembers scientists said 
this discovery is extremely important commented charles 
stevens of yale medical school whose editorial appears with the 
study in the british journal nature 
the work is the first finding of a gene that tells brain cells 
how to make a protein called a glutamate receptor when this 
receptor senses a natural substance called glutamate outside a 
brain cell it makes the cell more prone to fire off messages to 
neighboring brain cells 
in this way the receptor acts as a fundamental regulator of 
brain cell communication 
the newfound gene is for one type of glutamate receptor but it 
can be used to find genes for the other types said study coauthor 
stephen heinemann finding the gene is a first step toward studying 
a receptors structure and behavior 
eventually glutamate receptor studies may lead to development 
of drugs that limit brain damage from strokes head injury or 
repeated seizures and to new understanding about learning and 
memory the scientists said 
heinemann and colleagues at the salk institute for biological 
studies in san diego report that they isolated key portions of a 
rat glutamate receptor gene 
the same issue of nature carries reports of similar findings in 
frogs and chicks by scientists at salk the national institutes of 
health in bethesda md and the weizmann institute of science in 
rehovot israel 
in a telephone interview heinemann said his group went on to 
isolate the entire gene finding the human counterparts of rat 
glutamate receptor genes for further research should be relatively 
easy he said 
he said he hopes the work will lead to finding the gene for 
another type of glutamate receptor called the nmda receptor 
because it binds to a manmade chemical called nmethyldaspartate 
the nmda receptor plays a role in a phenomenon called 
excitotoxicity in which brain cells are fatally overstimulated 
after a stroke repeated epileptic seizures or a severe blow to the 
head stevens said by analyzing and experimenting with the nmda 
receptor researchers may be able to develop drugs that block the 
process and so limit brain damage he said 
the nmda receptor also triggers a process called longterm 
potentiation a strengthening of communication links between 
certain brain cells that is thought to underlie some forms of 
memory and learning so studying the receptor may illuminate brain 
function in those tasks stevens said 
such studies might one day lead to treatments for people with 
learning or memory disorders heinemann speculated 
scientists have been unable to study details of the nmda 
receptor because until now they had not found any glutamate 
receptor gene to guide the search for the nmda receptor gene 
stevens said 
the new work gives us the right gene family we think he 
said 
carl cotman of the university of california irvine cautioned 
that the study does not guarantee discovery of a gene for the nmda 
receptor although it probably increases the chances

sometimes overlooked in the excitement of 
the political upheaval in eastern europe is an increase in 
nationalism and racism along with the new climate of freedom 
in the soviet union east germany hungary and poland there are 
signs of nationalism and antisemitism that suggest the four 
decades of communist rule suppressed traditional hatreds instead of 
eradicating them 
since mikhail s gorbachev allowed more openess and lifted iron 
controls on dissent ethnic and racial hatreds have resurfaced in 
moslem central asia and in the caucasus republics of the soviet 
union ethnic violence there has killed more than 300 people 
azerbaijan and armenia are in conflict over the nagornokarabakh 
region and the baltic republics are gripped by growing nationalist 
sentiment 
writing in the current issue of foreign affairs zbigniew 
brzezinski says that although communism proclaimed itself to be a 
doctrine of internationalism communism in fact intensified popular 
nationalist passions 
the former us national security adviser noted that while 
poland and hungary are the most ethnically cohesive countries in 
eastern europe yugoslavia and czechoslovakia are diverse societies 
and both romania and bulgaria have substantial national minorities 
moreover all these states have borders that are potentially 
subject to revisionist aspirations on the part of their 
neighbors he wrote 
in the soviet union activity by pamyat a nationalist russian 
society also has picked up in this new era pamyat with its 
extremist xenophobic outlook is operating openly in a number of 
major russian cities 
in vienna soviet artist tanya loskutova said in a recent 
interview that gorbachevs campaign of openness had succeeded in 
unearthing hatreds that had lurked under the surface for decades 
antisemitism has become much more obvious because there is 
now a great opportunity to spit out the dirt that people had 
inside said ms loskutova a jew who emigrated in october and 
hopes to settle in the united states 
the sudden removal of constraints on freedom of expression has 
permitted organizations like pamyat to step up antijewish 
campaigns 
in hungary too overt antisemitism appears to be more 
pronounced since the country initiated reforms about two years ago 
that are meant to transform it into a full democracy 
but representatives of hungarys jewish community of 60000 seem 
to feel the racist sentiment expressed through the desecration of 
synagogues and in antisemitic outbursts at soccer matches is not 
on the rise 
they say its just becoming more visible 
antisemitism has been with us all these four decades but it 
was forbidden to discuss it openly chief rabbvi alfred schoener 
said in an interview 
more worrying to jews is that political reforms have been 
accompanied by the kind of growing nationalism that in the past has 
been linked to the persecution of jews 
the popularity of the hungarian democratic forum a main 
opposition party that has gained support by exploiting tensions 
with romania over transylvania and the fate of ethnic hungarians in 
the romanian territory is therefore a cause of worry for some jews 
gyoergy konrad a writer of jewish origin likes to relate how 
his mother once told him my boy be careful because once they 
start talking about transylvania theyll be deporting jews soon 
government figures and the hungarian media have also raised 
nationalist themes in an attempt to gain popularity the result is 
embarassing some members of hungarian minority groups living in 
neighboring countries 
the media in budapest are hurting us here with false reports 
of a mass autonomy movement in slovakia andras szemere a member 
of czechoslovakias 500000strong hungarian minority told a 
western visitor to bratislava recently sure we have our 
problems all minorities do everywhere but right now were more 
interested in working with the czechs and slovaks and getting rid 
of the communists 
in poland there have been scattered incidents of antisemitism 
preceding elections that gave the country its first government in 
four decades not dominated by the communists 
people scribbled the word jew on campaign posters of 
solidarity activist jacek kuron who is not jewish 
there are also reports that prominent solidarity activist and 
intellectural bronislaw geremek was passed over for the polish 
premiership because he is jewish 
in east germany where decades of isolation have fallen away 
with the opening of the berlin wall fears focus on the importation 
of racist sentiments 
at a meeting with jewish community leaders nov 27 east german 
security officials contended that leaflets distributed by west 
germanys ultrarightist republican party have appeared with 
increasing frequence in east germany since border controls were 
loosened nov 9 
since the opening of the borders to the west a rise in 
activities of neonazi groups in the direction of east germany can 
be noticed the official adn news agency said in a report on the 
meeting 
even romania the last bastion of stalinism in the soviet bloc 
is exploiting some of the unsolved ethnic problems 
in an apparent attempt to deflect attention from his own 
countrys economic and human rights record president nicolae 
ceausescu recently suggested the return of the former bessarabia 
now soviet moldavia which romania lost during world war ii

the worlds beef trade is undergoing rapid 
changes as production declines in 1989 and production falters in 
some major countries 
one result the agriculture department said wednesday is that 
the united states is edging ahead of new zealand as a worldclass 
beef exporter 
us exports are estimated at 450000 metric tons up from 
313000 tons in 1988 the departments foreign agricultural service 
reported exports are expected to rise to about 508000 tons in 
1990 
most of the increase is the result of larger sales to japan 
under last years trade liberalization by tokyo to open the door to 
more beef and citrus 
new zealands total beef and veal exports meanwhile are 
estimated at 439000 tons in 1989 and 368000 tons in 1990 
production rose this year as drought forced more cattle to 
slaughter 
us imports of beef which reached 11 million tons in 1988 
are expected to decline this year to around 990000 tons the 
report said the decrease is the result of smaller shipments from 
australia where production is down and more meat was diverted to 
the lucrative japanese market 
the report said us beef imports in 1990 are likely to decline 
slightly to around 970000 tons as australia continues exporting 
to japan 
us beef exports grew at a faster rate than those of the 
other five countries during the 1980s rising from sixth to fourth 
position by 1988 the report said in 1989 it is expected that 
the united states will surpass new zealand to become the third 
largest beef exporter in the world 
the top six beef exporters in 1989 are australia 823000 tons 
the 12nation european economic community 759000 united states 
450000 new zealand 439000 brazil 370000 and argentina 
350000 
overall global beef and veal production is expected to decline 
this year to about 452 million metric tons from 453 million tons 
in 1988 the report said much of the decease occurred in the eec 
argentina brazil and australia 
the situation in the major beef producing countries is watched 
closely by usda trade analysts and livestock producers 
particularly conditions in australia and new zealand 
cattle herds are expected to increase in australia to about 253 
million head by 1991 from 243 million at the beginning of 1989 
the report said 
dampening a more rapid increase in the herd size is an 
attractive wool market and expansion in the sheep industry the 
report said without this competition for resources total cattle 
numbers could increase more rapidly 
in new zealand drought forced cattle slaughter to about 33 
million head this year from 31 million in 1988 but slaughter may 
decline to around 28 million head in 1990 the report said

the agriculture department says it will soon 
pay wheat and barley producers about 175 million in deficiency 
payments for participating in the governments 1989 acreage program 
keith bjerke executive vice president of the departments 
commodity credit corp said wednesday that the payments to wheat 
and barley farmers will be made in cash through local offices of 
the agricultural stabilization and conservation service 
wheat payments will total about 168 million and barley 7 
million no payments will be made for 1989 oats the payments will 
include a deduction for advance payments earlier this year 
deficiency payments are made to help make up the difference 
between a target price and the higher of the price support loan 
rate or a fivemonth market price average 
for example the target price for wheat this year is 410 per 
bushel and the basic loan rate is 257 per bushel the market 
price average for five months was 378 per bushel 
thus the deficiency payment rate would be 32 cents per bushel 
the difference between the target and the market price an advance 
of 25 cents per bushel was made so farmers will get 7 cents per 
bushel at final settlement

a reduction in the use of wheat as animal feed 
is partly responsible for a sharp jump in global corn trade says 
the agriculture department 
in the last four years world corn shipments have increased an 
estimated 28 percent the largest increase since the late 1970s 
the departments foreign agricultural service said wednesday in a 
report 
there has been some worldwide stepup in animal feeding 
particularly in the soviet union and major east asian markets 
the report said but in the last two years an additional reason 
for the sharp expansion is the reduced use of wheat for feed 
caused by relatively low global wheat supplies 
as a result wheat has become more expensive in relation to the 
livestock feeding value of corn 
further the report said us corn exports have nearly doubled 
in the last few years while exports of other foreign suppliers 
have dropped by onethird due to shifts to more profitable crops 
like oilseeds increased domestic utilization and poor crops 
the net result is that the us now provides nearly 80 percent 
of the worlds corn export needs up dramatically from just a few 
years ago the report said

gary coleman called his mothers attempt to 
wrest control of his estate vindictive and his lawyer said 
allegations in her court request may damage the actors career 
coleman 21 and attorney charles wake responded wednesday to 
edmonia sue colemans statements in court documents asserting her 
son was incapable of handling his 6 million fortune 
my mothers latest legal action obviously stems from her 
frustration at not being able to control my life said coleman 
star of the old diffrent strokes tv series 
mrs colemans conservatorship petition filed monday said his 
deteriorating physical and mental condition puts him at 
significant risk of financial exploitation 
the allegations upon which sue colemans petition is based are 
simply not true said wake this sort of tactic will only 
backfire because it will expose garys parents to additional 
liability for malicious prosecution 
the potential damage to garys career is enormous and this 
sort of accusation can be extremely harmful even though it has no 
foundation whatsoever 
mrs coleman asked that a conservator be appointed for her son 
and that us trust co of california be placed in control of 
assets that include 6 million in property and annual income of 
750000 
a superior court hearing on the request was scheduled for jan 3 
it was latest action in the continuing legal wrangle between 
coleman and his parents 
in february coleman filed suit in santa monica against his 
parents and former business adviser anita dethomas alleging they 
improperly profited from his financial success 
the lawsuit alleges the colemans and dethomas diverted his 
profits and assets to themselves coleman said in his suit that he 
felt his parents were unduly influenced by dethomas 
i was very hurt by the vindictive response it caused 
coleman said wednesday 
coleman was born with an atrophied right kidney and has 
undergone two transplants during a childhood that required frequent 
dialysis and medications the court documents said 
mrs coleman said she was concerned about her sons business 
manager dion mial whom she described as a 25yearold unemployed 
michael jackson impersonator 
coleman was 10 when diffrent strokes made it debut in 
november 1978 and his character arnold jackson opposite costar 
todd bridges became a hit with young viewers his twinkling eyes 
pudgy cheeks and flawless timing helped make the tv situation 
comedy a ratings winner

the first call from the university of montreal 
came into the citys emergency 911 phone line in late afternoon 
there is a hostagetaking there is gunfire and there are lots 
of people wounded police quoted the caller as saying 
it was the beginning of what may be the worst mass shooting in 
canadian history when it was over 14 women had been killed the 
gunman had committed suicide and a dozen other people had been 
rushed to hospital operating rooms 
based on police and eyewitness accounts the drama began as 
students were ending their last classes of the term 
about 430 pm a man thought to be in his twenties and dressed 
in hunting garb entered the cafeteria on the first floor of the 
universitys engineering building and opened fire with what police 
believe was a 22caliber rifle killing three women 
the gunman then went up to the second floor and walked into a 
packed classroom where he ordered the men into one corner of the 
room and the women into another 
several of the students who had been making oral presentations 
on the final day of classes before exams said later they thought 
it was a joke 
but the gunman fired a shot into the wall and they quickly 
followed his instructions 
he told the men to leave they did so and police said the 
gunman screamed before opening fire on the women youre all a 
bunch of feminists 
six slain women were later found in the classroom 
on the same floor he killed a woman in an administration office 
then he climbed to the third floor where he shot four more 
women in the corridor it was a human hunt and we were the 
quarry said one witness quoted by canadian press 
he was clearly gunning for the women said another student 
he continued up to the fourth and fifth floors shooting and 
wounding both men and women 
then police say he returned to the third floor and turned the 
gun on himself 
one police officer who was called to the scene discovered his 
daughter was among the dead

t david franklin wants the world know 
hes broke but appeals for money like the one containing pieces 
of the berlin wall keep streaming in 
the package was delivered even though it was addressed to the 
millionaire david franklin in portland maine usa 
it came from a young west berlin woman who had read news reports 
about the 32yearold benefactors efforts to help residents in his 
adopted city of portland start their own businesses 
as a sign that a new time begins i send you a little part of 
the original berlin wall a sign that people should come together 
and help each other in peace love and harmony the woman wrote 
in asking franklin to finance her healthrelated studies 
appeals have poured in by the thousands said franklin he says 
his life has changed dramatically in the six weeks since he placed 
a classified ad in local newspapers offering to bankroll firsttime 
entrepreneurs and provide them with office space and business 
advice 
enthusiasm and hard work were the traits the community college 
dropout from a bluecollar baltimore suburb sought in examining the 
flood of applicants before selecting 15 beneficiaries of his 
interestfree loans 
these were people who didnt need a push he said they 
had the enthusiasm they just needed the guidance 
after writing checks totaling more than 220000 and wondering 
aloud how he will pay his next mortgage payment on the apartment 
house where he lives and works franklin has a standard reply to 
the unending pleas 
im broke im out of money 
undaunted applicants often ask franklin to put their names on a 
waiting list for any future largesse 
franklin acknowledged that though he may be strapped for cash 
he probably remains a millionaire on paper thats because of the 
appreciation in value of real estate he accumulated in baltimore 
new hampshire and maine as his career as a computer salesman 
blossomed 
he resigned his lucrative sales job last spring out of boredom 
and invested in a computer company in portland he then looked at 
job possibilities in the area found nothing of interest and 
decided to use his business talents to help others 
franklin insists he was just an average guy before his 
newspaper ad made him an international celebrity and propelled him 
into 16hour workdays 
recipients of franklins seed money include several welfare 
recipients a recently discharged serviceman and an exconvict 
trying to earn a living as an artist 
the startup money has ranged from as little as 200 for 
supplies and equipment to help a young woman begin a cleaning 
business to 100000 to publish the comic book artists work 
form months 23yearold bonnie robinson wanted to open the 
cleaning business to get off welfare but couldnt afford a vacuum 
cleaner or other supplies 
so she answered franklins ad and he helped her buy the 
equipment 
but she admits to being leery after first reading the ad i 
thought maybe it was a guy who wanted to kidnap people and sell 
children so i made sure not to bring my daughter 
franklin who embarked on the project three months after his 
arrival in portland said the role of benefactor is a weighty 
burden 
a lot of people dont realize this but its a big 
responsibility when youre dealing with peoples dreams he said 
theyre looking up to you as an answer its frightening 
diane branscomb associate director of the small business 
development center at the university of southern maine said people 
applying to franklin should be cautious because they are vulnerable 
when they start a business even if it is with someone elses money 
they could put in the time and effort and blood sweat and 
tears and lose the whole kit and caboodle she said

tone to the horses as millie cowered nearby 
finally the first lady scooped up millie in her arms as 
photographers frantically maneuvered to get the shot 
its just because shes never seen a horse before mrs bush 
said millie cannot steal this show please 
growers duane meade and bradley berkey of spartansburg pa 
won a contest sponsored by the national christmas tree association 
for the right to have one of their trees displayed at the nations 
most prominent residence 
a white house delegation traveled to the familys 140acre farm

6 to wednesdays ceremony and they were invited to sit in the 
carriage as it rolled past reporters and guests 
the growers wondered how the tree would fit through the white 
house door 
miracles happen every year here dont worry itll get in

a male prostitute who testified before the 
house ethics committee on his relationship with rep barney frank 
remains under subpoena and may be called back for additional 
testimony the panels chairman says 
steven gobie who claims to have run a male prostitution ring 
out of franks capitol hill apartment testified for four hours 
wednesday at a closed meeting of the ethics committee 
in past comments gobie had suggested that he had information 
embarrassing to other members of congress besides frank dmass 
but after the hearing the ethics panels chairman rep julian 
dixon dcalif said gobies testimony did not expand the scope of 
the investigation 
dixon said gobie may be called back for additional testimony 
but that the investigation isnt any broader as a result of the 
information he provided wednesday 
frank has said he had a brief sexual relationship with gobie 
after meeting him and paying him 80 for sex in 1985 he said he 
later hired gobie with personal funds to serve as a housekeeper and 
driver from july 1985 through august 1987 
frank has acknowledged that he intervened with virginia 
probation authorities on gobies behalf but he denies other 
allegations by gobie including that he knew gobie was running a 
prostitution ring from his apartment and that gobie evidently took 
advantage of him 
frank had acknowledged his homosexuality before gobies 
allegations were made 
leaving the session gobie said he was not out to destroy 
franks reputation and career 
i think hes a very fine person i always have and i always 
will i think hes one of the best people up on the hill gobie 
said 
frank has not yet testified to the committee neither frank nor 
his attorney stephen sachs attended wednesdays session 
dixon said the committee will continue its investigation through 
the current congressional recess which is scheduled to end jan 23

cuba ending a prolonged silence says 2016 
military and other cuban personnel have died in angola since 
president fidel castro began his commitment there 14 years ago 
angel pino a spokesman for the cuban diplomatic mission here 
gave that figure wednesday in announcing that the remains of all 
cubans who died carrying out international missions in angola and 
elsewhere have been returned to cuba in recent days 
the cuban casualty toll had never before been discussed 
officially 
the dead were being honored at a ceremony today outside havana 
at which castro was due to participate along with angolan president 
jose eduardo dos santos and ethiopian vice president fisseha desta 
pino said 2289 cubans including troops and civilian technical 
advisers have died abroad over the years more than 400000 have 
participated in such missions mostly in africa 
pino said 160 cubans died in ethiopia where thousands of cuban 
troops were sent in 1977 two years after cubas involvement in 
angola began 
the number of cuban dead in angola has been the subject of 
considerable speculation over the years but cuba has always 
regarded the figure as a state secret three years ago angolan 
anticommunist rebel leader jonas savimbi whose forces have been 
fighting the cubanbacked government for years put the cuban death 
toll at more than 6000 
of the 2289 casualties pino said 863 were killed in combat 
595 died of illness and 829 were accident fatalities the remains 
of 36 cubans could not be recovered several others disappeared 
the remains were returned to cuba between nov 27 and dec 4 and 
have been sent to their hometowns over the years some families 
have complained that the remains of relatives who died while 
serving the revolution abroad had not been brought back to cuba for 
burial 
at its peak cuban involvement in angola reached 50000 
personnel but castro agreed last december to withdraw all its 
forces by early 1991 as part of an accord brokered by us 
assistant secretary of state chester crocker 
cubas troop commitment to ethiopia declined over the years 
ending several months ago 
cuba also has been involved in internationalist missions of 
either a civilian or military nature in a number of other 
countries including equatorial guinea and mozambique and in the 
middle east and asia as well

joe cruzan has watched with anguish for nearly 
seven years as his daughter lies unconscious in a missouri hospital 
and he says listening to the supreme court consider her fate was 
yet another sad event 
it certainly was a very painful thing to sit through cruzan 
said after the the justices heard arguments on whether his 
daughters feeding tube should be removed 
i would like to be able to express my feelings to them why we 
are very comfortable with our decision why we feel that we are 
doing what nancy would want us to do he said 
cruzan a 55yearold sheet metal worker from southwestern 
missouri and his wife want the nations highest court to grant 
their request for removal of a feeding tube sustaining their 
braindamaged daughter nancy 
on wednesday justices for the first time took up the 
righttodie issue as they heard oral arguments by attorneys in 
the case of the 32yearold woman who has been in what doctors 
call a persistent vegetative state since a 1983 automobile 
accident the missouri supreme court has ruled that doctors cannot 
remove the tube that supplies food and water keeping ms cruzan 
alive 
the familys attorney william colby told the justices that if 
ms cruzan were lucid for a moment and could come before this 
court she would choose liberty and ask for removal of the 
feeding tube but she will never recover to do that he said 
assistant attorney general robert presson of missouri maintained 
that ms cruzans parents have no right to permit their daughters 
death especially without clear and convincing evidence she 
would choose to die 
letting her die goes against the states interest in 
preventing suicide he said 
solicitor general kenneth starr the bush administrations top 
courtroom lawyer supported the states position 
a ruling by the court is expected by july the justices recently 
have been reluctant to expand individual rights but they gave no 
clear sign on the outcome of the case as they questioned the 
lawyers during arguments 
colby said after the case that he didnt expect the court to 
issue a broad ruling on the the righttodie question an estimated 
10000 people in this country are being kept alive in a manner 
similar to that used for ms cruzan legal and medical officials 
say the courts ruling could set a precedent in determining the 
limits of lifesustaining care 
doctors say ms cruzan could live for 30 years or more in her 
current condition unless the feeding tube is removed her body is 
rigid her hands and feet constricted and bent into claw shapes 
she can breathe on her own and at times her eyes are open and move 
randomly 
cruzan and his wife joyce an older daughter and two 
grandchildren watched the supreme court proceedings 
afterward he expressed concerns about the possible effects on 
other families if the high court denies his daughter a right to 
die he contended it would force people to consider initially not 
ordering lifesustaining treatment for fear that it could not later 
be stopped 
this puts families in a terrible situation of being faced with 
making a decision about life support when there is still hope when 
it still might do some good he said 
asked how he thought the oral arguments played out to the 
justices cruzan replied i have no idea im not an attorney 
im just a spectator

lawyers for a man convicted of operating a 
drug ring that took in 2 million a week in the nations capital 
say they will appeal the verdict while us attorney jay b 
stephens says the convicted dealer will now face other charges 
rayful edmond iii 24 was convicted wednesday of operating a 
cocaine distribution network that prosecutors said was responsible 
for up to 30 percent of the cocaine sold in the district of 
columbia 
a 12member us district court jury found edmond guilty of all 
seven charges against him after more than four days of 
deliberations capping a 12week trial held amid extremely tight 
security the verdict means edmond faces a mandatory life prison 
sentence ten other defendants were convicted of assisting him 
everyone on the defense team is upset by the verdict said 
william murphy one of edmonds attorneys we had the cards 
stacked against us from the beginning and we are going to 
appeal 
us district court judge charles richey has not yet set a 
sentencing date for edmond or his associates 
edmond faces additional charges including three counts of 
firstdegree murder and conspiracy stephens said he plans to try 
edmond on those charges despite the mandatory life sentence in the 
drug distribution case 
our immediate plan is to proceed stephens said the 
primary goal is to bring this organization to a halt 
prosecutors had described edmonds drug network as a blend of 
family members and close friends who conducted their operations 
with a sophisticated and deadly entrepreneurial flare 
the charges against edmond included conspiracy to violate drug 
laws employing minors to possess and distribute cocaine traveling 
across state lines to sell drugs and using a telephone to set up 
illegal drug deals 
convictions on those counts satisfy a definition of a continuing 
criminal enterprise a crime that carries a mandatory life sentence 
edmonds 10 codefendants including an aunt a sister a 
brother and several close friends were found guilty of conspiracy 
to deal drugs that crime carries a penalty of 10 years to life in 
prison 
at its peak last summer the prosecutors charged the edmond 
network was pumping up to 440 pounds of cocaine per week into the 
streets of washington 
the message should be clear if you deal death and 
destruction you will pay with your life stephens said after 
noting that edmond had been perceived by some friends and neighbors 
as a hero for his ability to make money the prosecutor said edmond 
should be seen instead as a purveyor of human destruction 
the trial featured extremely strict security measures at the 
outset richey ruled that jurors names be kept secret even from 
himself and lawyers to protect the jury from reprisals the home of 
one witness mother was firebombed during the trial and an 
informant was shot after his name was accidentally divulged by the 
prosecution 
defense lawyer james robertson suggested that the unusual 
security provisions including a 1inch bulletproof shield 
around the courtroom made it impossible for the defendants to 
receive a fair trial 
no matter what happened in that courtroom it was going to 
make it very difficult to give mr edmond the benefit of the 
doubt he said

half of all americans believe communism is 
dying twice the number who thought so nine months ago a media 
generalassociated press poll has found 
the survey found views of communism shifting radically as reform 
sweeps eastern europe with far fewer americans now seeing the 
soviet union and its warsaw pact allies as a threat 
but more americans feel threatened by china where authorities 
in june suppressed prodemocracy demonstrators and the poll found 
no change in the relatively high level of concern about communism 
in latin america 
the survey tracked opinion by repeating questions that first 
were asked in a media generalassociated press poll in march a few 
months before the democratic reform movement gained full force in 
eastern europe 
the change in opinion was striking then for example only 19 
percent said communism was on the decline around the world in the 
new poll 54 percent said communism was declining worldwide a 
nearly threefold increase 
similarly 52 percent regarded communism in eastern europe as 
less of a threat to us security now than in the past in march 
just 28 percent held that view and 51 percent in the new poll saw 
soviet communism as less of a threat to the united states up from 
38 percent nine months ago 
in one of their broadest measures the surveys asked 
respondents in your view is communism dying or not in 
march 25 percent said yes in the new poll 52 percent said yes 
the new survey was conducted nov 1725 as many of the changes 
reshaping eastern europe were still evolving the changes some of 
which culminated after the poll was done include establishment of 
a partially noncommunist government in poland and the fall of 
communist leaderships in east germany hungary and czechoslovakia 
optimism was the greatest for east germany where on nov 9 the 
berlin wall was opened after 28 years of division from the west 
sixty percent in the survey expected that within their lifetimes 
east germans will enjoy the same freedoms americans have now 
by contrast only 26 percent expected americanstyle freedoms to 
come within their lifetimes to residents of the soviet union where 
reforms are progressing more slowly and the communist party retains 
supremacy and only 14 percent expected such freedoms in china 
where soldiers staged a bloody crackdown on dissidents near 
tiananmen square on june 34 
indeed during the past nine months more americans have come to

as in the earlier poll concern was greatest about communism in 
latin america fortysix percent called it an increasing threat to

the dollar rose against the japanese yen in tokyo 
thursday while the key index on the tokyo stock exchange set 
another new high 
the dollar closed at 14413 yen up 038 yen from wednesdays 
close of 14375 yen after opening at 14395 yen the us currency 
ranged between 14394 and 14433 yen 
on the stock market the nikkei stock average of 225 selected 
issues which rose 16012 points for a record closing of 3765429 
wednesday added another 20382 points or 054 percent to close 
at 3785811 another new high 
currency dealers said the dollars bullish opening in tokyo was 
largely due to the currencys gains on overseas markets overnight 
the dollarbuying was triggered by warnings issued by the east 
german military that it would not tolerate attempts by citizens to 
seize munitions from security installations according to dealers 
a fleeting fear that the military might take action to block the 
countrys reform movement led some to sell the west german currency 
for dollars they said 
the dollars decline against the mark in new york was 
accelerated overnight by comments from us undersecretary of the 
treasury david mulford who said the united states was not 
alarmed about the dollars recent steep 10 percent decline 
against the mark 
he also noted the dollar has only slipped 2 percent against the 
yen 
the new york market took mulfords comments to mean that the 
us central bank has not been intervening to shore up the sagging 
dollar as many had thought 
securities dealers said the nikkei index rose as market players 
were reassured by an economic planning agency announcement of 29 
percent growth in japans real gross national product in the 
julyseptember quarter over the previous quarter 
the rise in inflationadjusted gnp was equivalent to an annual 
122 percent growth the largest since 1973 according to the 
agency 
trading is becoming more active and broader said a dealer 
at nikko securities co requesting anonymity i expect the 
bullish trend to continue for some time

a father whose entire family was among 
the 27 people killed in a fiery bus crash cast a stern gaze from 
the witness stand at the man accused in the nations deadliest 
alcoholrelated traffic accident 
i just wanted to see if the man sitting over there being tried 
for the murder of my three girls would have enough compassion to 
look my way as i looked his way army 1st sgt lee williams said 
after testifying wednesday in larry mahoneys murder and 
drunkendriving trial 
and i didnt see it 
from the witness stand in carroll circuit court williams glared 
at mahoney as he told of losing his wife marilyn joy 34 and 
daughters kristen 14 and robin 10 
williams was the last in a series of parents and spouses who 
testified about the 24 youths and three adults who died in the may 
14 1988 crash 
authorities said the crash occurred when mahoney drove his 
pickup truck in the wrong lanes of interstate 71 south of this ohio 
river town and plowed into the bus owned by the first assembly of 
god church in radcliff 
in july williams married the widow of another crash victim 
dotty pearman williams who also testified about her loss 
her husband bus driver john pearman and a niece were killed 
her daughter christy survived with severe burns 
christy returned and was severely injured mrs williams 
said john was brought back in a cold black body bag 
in other testimony two witnesses said mahoney was drunk the 
night of the crash 
kerry cantrell a laboratory supervisor from humana 
hospitaluniversity of louisville testified a blood sample drawn 
from mahoney after the crash showed a blood alcohol level of 024 
terry comstock a state police chemist said he tested the same 
blood sample drawn four days after the crash his tests showed 
blood alcohol levels of 018 and 020 
in kentucky a person is considered intoxicated if their blood 
alcohol level is at least 010 
defense attorney russell baldani attacked the discrepancy among 
the three tests 
mahoney 36 is charged with 27 counts of murder 42 counts of 
wanton endangerment 12 counts of assault and a count of drunken 
driving 
testimony of the parents and spouses was brief because a 
kentucky supreme court decision limits questioning of homicide 
victims family members to basic biographical information about the 
deceased said assistant attorney general paul richwalsky jr 
but williams said even a short time on the stand was painful 
when the lawyer says when was the last time you saw your 
family for a second or two i honestly saw kristen walk down 
the hall to the bedroom and i remember putting my arms around her 
and i remember kissing her goodbye and telling her i loved her 
williams told reporters later 
he spoke at length and in heartbreaking detail about his 
experiences during the trial 
this is the second christmas im going without my two 
daughters williams said and i miss them every day 
williams viewed mahoneys three emotional outbursts in court 
last month as an expression of guilt but not sorrow 
but for his three times i have broken down three thousand 
times williams said

the navy is defending its new 12 billion 
destroyer in the wake of fresh charges that the ship could be 
detected by soviet airborne radar despite pentagon attempts to make 
it radarevading 
with the arleigh burke class this is the best warship the 
world has seen navy spokesman lt bruce cole said in response to 
allegations from one lawmaker that the destroyer program is fraught 
with technical and financial problems 
rep john dingell dmich who last september called the 33 
billion destroyer program a procurement nightmare of cost 
overruns and schedule delays contended wednesday that the navy was 
forced to bail out the destroyers manufacturer bath iron works 
corp of maine 
in a letter to rep charles e bennett dfla dingell said 
bath iron works faced serious financial problems and the navy spent 
between 75 million to 90 million to save the company the 
michigan democrat also said the money came from unspecified 
pentagon accounts and questioned whether slush funds were 
common at the defense department 
clearly i think the navy and the contractors are attempting 
to hoodwink both of us dingell said in a threepage letter to 
bennett chairman of the house armed services subcommittee on 
seapower and strategic and critical materials 
the letter dated dec 4 was obtained by the associated press 
duane d fitzgerald president and chief operating officer of 
bath iron works called the bailout suggestion laughable he 
said the navy and the company did agree on contract adjustments 
but they totaled 35 million 
the navy denied that a bailout took place and stressed that the 
ships hailed as the most advanced combat ships ever will be built 
within budget 
bennett in a twoparagraph statement released late wednesday 
said he received dingells letter which makes many assertions 
and raises many questions of fact 
the navy tells me today that some of this information is 
incorrect and that some of the letters conclusions are 
unjustified said bennett who cautioned against jumping to 
conclusions but promised a subcommittee inquiry into the destroyer 
program when congress returns in january 
the ddg51 destroyer named after arleigh burke world war ii 
naval hero and former chief of naval operations is designed with a 
more expensive allsteel superstructure instead of one that was 
part aluminum and more prone to splintering and fire damage 
the first destroyer which is scheduled to be delivered to the 
navy in february 1991 will be equipped with sophisticated aegis 
computers and tomahawk cruise missiles 
the navy has tried to reduce the destroyers radar 
crosssection which is the enemys ability to discern the type of 
ship showing up on radar and give it some of the characteristics 
of the air forces b2 stealth bomber 
the steps taken by the navy to reduce the radar crosssection of 
the new destroyer include more rounded edges and less 90degree 
angles a reduction in crosssection means an enemy has to get 
in closer cole said the same approach was taken with the b2 
dingell contends that incorporating stealth characteristics on 
an 8315ton allsteel ship became an overwhelming design and 
engineering problem for bath iron works that led to the contract 
increases 
dingell also said that according to experts an airborne radar 
at an altitude of 50000 feet would detect it easily at over 300 
miles 
complicating the situation is the number of soviet 
antiradiation missiles that can be airlaunched shiplaunched or 
submarinelaunched said dingell who cited a secret report by the 
defense intelligence agency and central intelligence agency titled 
special assessment on the antiradiation missile threat 
fitzgerald questioned the appropriateness of dingells 
references to a classified issue such as naval radar capability 
the whole business of radar signature still has same 
classifications congressman dingell can choose to violate his 
security clearance i dont choose to violate mine fitzgerald 
said 
suffice it to say we think hes wrong the executive added

condemned to death for the 1983 robberyslaying of wanda jean 
lopez 24 a service station clerk in corpus christi 
i want to say i hold no grudges deluna said in a brief 
final statement i hate nobody i want my family to know i love 
them i want to tell everyone on death row to keep the faith up 
to keep going everything will be all right 
the us supreme court rejected by a 72 vote a request to halt 
the execution until a new appeal could be filed on his behalf the 
5th us circuit court of appeals refused to block it tuesday 
deluna was the fourth person executed this year in texas 
bringing to 33 the number of executions in the state since the 
supreme court allowed capital punishment to resume in 1976 the 
total is the highest of any state nationwide 120 people have been 
put to death 
ms lopez alerted by customers that a man with a knife was 
outside the station was on the phone with police when deluna came 
in for a pack of cigarettes feb 4 1983 
on the tape shes talking to the cops and then you heard 
that scream said steve schiwetz the assistant district attorney 
who prosecuted deluna he was just real belligerent this was 
totally uncalled for there was just no reason to kill this girl 
he didnt know her 
the last thing she was saying was ill give the money but 
he just wanted to stick her with the knife its really a bad 
deal 
deluna on parole for about six weeks after serving part of a 
threeyear sentence for attempted rape and car theft was arrested 
after he was found hiding under a truck near the slaying witnesses 
identified him at trial 
he had insisted another person committed the crime but has 
refused to elaborate 
im not going to talk about it he said i took the stand 
the jury didnt believe me 
the high school dropout blamed his problems on alcohol and drug 
abuse plus getting mixed up with the wrong crowd 
schiwetz said delunas juvenile record included numerous thefts 
this guy stole every car in corpus christi before he was 18 
deluna said in his last interview a week ago that he was afraid 
of dying 
i dont think anybody can prepare yourself for dying he 
said i cant imagine myself lying down on that gurney i try to

a nervous hans jurich gestured toward the 
rainsoaked grounds of the secret police institute he directs a 
place where workers crack codes and build eavesdropping devices 
as you can see there are no helicopters or tanks here now 
he offered 
in an odd switch that only could have come during these heady 
days of the east german uprising it was the secret police who were 
getting the third degree 
jurichs interrogators were reform activists from a new citizens 
committee that has taken it upon itself to probe official 
corruption 
three activists from the organization which is quartered above 
a religious bookstore on sophienstrasse jumped into a 
mudencrusted volkswagen golf on wednesday after getting a call 
from colleagues with a hot tip 
all we know is that witnesses in the area have reported that 
helicopters and tanks were moving around yesterday and trucks were 
seen hauling away material gabriela kleiner of the new forum 
prodemocracy group explained as the car careened through east 
berlins muddy central streets 
this could be dangerous thats why we are taking along the 
press as protection 
a carload of journalists from the communistrun berliner zeitung 
followed behind the speeding graftbusters 
the independent investigative committee was formed by reform 
movement activists on sunday after word spread that ousted 
communist leaders accused of corruption were having incriminating 
evidence removed from their offices 
angry citizens began standing watch around official buildings on 
monday and tuesday until police could set up a security cordon to 
prevent losses 
communist premier hans modrow has ordered police units to 
cooperate with the citizens committee but officials are still 
considering whether it should have access to information collected 
by a government panel probing corruption 
east german television on tuesday disclosed the groups 
existence and gave out its address and telephone number for those 
with information to relay 
at least 200 calls were fielded overnight and early wednesday at 
the committee office 
this is our second special action explained matthias 
etzold driver of the golf but last time on monday we arrived 
too late and everything was gone 
asked what they planned to do should they encounter the reported 
tanks or helicopters ms kleiner said they would call the police 
after 30 minutes of negotiating rutted roads the car screeched 
to a halt in front of a gated and guarded compound on 
kopenickstrasse 
were from the independent investigative committee and we want 
to talk to responsible officials etzold shouted through the 
narrow opening of a clouded plexiglass window at an entrance 
security booth 
the whole entourage was invited in to meet with federal minister 
for science and research peterklaus budig who hadnt noticed 
tanks or air actions in recent days 
but this is all necessary im all for it the smiling 
official offered eagerly commenting on the ambush visit its 
necessary to clear the air and have a fresh start 
maybe it was the compound next door where the federal ministry 
for state security operates a research institute he offered 
yes we were told you were coming confessed the gate guard 
at the secret polices institute for technical research our 
director will be here to talk with you in a moment 
jurich a portly crewcut bureaucrat sweating profusely despite 
the damp december cold had likely already been having a bad day 
since the entire leadership of the secret police resigned tuesday 
night under pressure 
reform groups had assailed the ministrys leadership for 
allowing agents to do what they had done with impunity for years 
harass and beat protesters 
told of reports alleging removal of evidence from the premises 
jurich laughed nervously and pointed out that there was no military 
hardware in evidence 
mind if we have a look around etzold queried 
first the answer was no as the compound was a sensitive point 
of manufacture of electronic warfare materials which you can use 
your imagination to calculate the use of jurich said 
then he offered a short tour of the metallittered grounds in 
consolation 
we have nothing to hide the director contended 
the group was able to see nothing more complicated than rusting 
pipes and palettes of what looked like mailboxes piled outside 
factory doors 
no the investigators could not talk to workers this was after 
all a matter of state security 
weve wasted our time bemoaned ms kleiner the problem 
is that we are so naive this is a mafia we are dealing with

the soviet union can now launch groundattack 
jets from its first fullscale aircraft carrier a naval aviation 
advance that the us navy says holds the potential for offensive 
use 
the development came only days before mikhail s gorbachev 
pressed president bush on naval arms control issues at the malta 
summit 
the us navy confirmed on wednesday that the 65000ton tbilisi 
aircraft carrier had launched and recovered three fighter jets 
during trials in the black sea the mig29 fulcrum a su27 
flanker and the su25 frogfoot ground attack aircraft 
the tbilisis capabilities are a marked advance over the much 
smaller kievclass carrier which is capable of transporting only 
helicopters and jumpjets 
while the tbilisis sea trials are not unexpected navy 
officials pointed to the type of aircraft used on the carrier as 
interesting as well as the timing of the event 
they are way ahead of schedule said one navy officer who 
spoke on condition he not be identified by name 
use of an aircraft carrier vastly improves soviet tactical 
aviation capabilities allowing fighter jets to be launched far 
beyond the range of soviet borders 
the tbilisi is the first of its class while two others are 
under construction 
the ship uses a ski jump bow to launch aircraft and not the 
highpowered catapults that hurl jets from us carriers but the 
soviets do use the arresting wires that stop planes as they land on 
the deck just as the american carriers do 
the navy in a statement pointing to the ships offensive 
capabilities said 
the soviets have insisted that the tbilisi is intended 
for defensive purposes only nonetheless the demonstrated 
capability of the tbilisi to accommodate a variant of one of the 
soviet unions principal groundattack aircraft the frogfoot 
shows a potential for offensive operations 
while pentagon officials said the trials took place in 
midnovember the navy confirmed them several days after gorbachev 
sought to ban shortrange nuclear weapons aboard the superpowers 
ships according to white house spokesman marlin fitzwater 
gorbachev illustrated his concern over the wideranging us 
navy giving bush a map of us naval bases deployments and 
maneuvers around the soviet union 
in rejecting gorbachevs argument said fitzwater bush 
maintained that 
the soviet union is a landbased power but the navy is 
crucial to us in terms of maintaining all of our commitments around 
the world maintaining open sea lanes and commercial lanes around 
the world 
another defense official said the definition of the soviet 
warship as an aircraft carrier is of some importance to the region 
the soviets continue to tell turkey that this is not an 
aircraft carrier he said adding that the soviets contend it is 
a heavy aircraftcarrying cruiser 
under the 1936 montreux convention turkey could bar the 
movement of such a warship through the dardanelles which is the 
passage between the black sea and the mediterranean the official 
said 
the convention put the control of the water passage in turkish 
hands and it allows the nation to close the straits to warships of 
other nations in time of war 
the soviets have stated that the tbilisi will join the northern 
fleet and operate out of the kola peninsula the navy said

secretary of state james a baker iii still 
faces tough problems in getting mideast peace talks started even 
with the conditional acceptance by the palestine liberation 
organization of a first round of negotiations 
baker will be able to convene talks in washington early next 
year with the foreign ministers of egypt and israel however going 
beyond that stage will take slick maneuvering by baker as well as 
concessions from all sides 
the plo speaking through egypt agreed wednesday to the 
session the israeli cabinet agreed last month 
but us officials made it clear that the plo and israel still 
have reservations about what happens next and baker will have to 
find a way to ease their concerns to keep going 
basically yasser arafats group is clinging to its claim to 
represent palestinians everywhere it wants to play a role in 
selecting the palestinian delegation that would meet with israel in 
cairo as the next step in a drawnout peace process 
israel on the other hand wants to exclude the plo even from a 
behindthescenes role bakers fivepoint program guarantees that 
israel will go to cairo only after a satisfactory list of 
palestinians has been worked out 
but another provision of the baker plan specifies that egypt 
cannot substitute itself for the palestinians and that it will 
consult with palestinians on all aspects of the dialogue 
that could mean the plo will be able to play an influential role 
even if its not at the table 
despite the problems though baker achieved a breakthrough of 
sorts after three months of dickering with foreign ministers moshe 
arens of israel and esmat abdel meguid of egypt 
they will continue the bargaining at the washington meeting 
which state department spokeswoman margaret tutwiler said would be 
held in january at the earliest 
the us goal is to carry out a proposal by israeli prime 
minister yitzhak shamir for elections among the 14 million 
palestinians who live on the west bank and in gaza 
the elected palestinians would negotiate with israel an 
arrangement for limited selfrule after the fiveyear experiment 
israel jordan egypt and palestinians would hold talks on an 
overall settlement 
the plo has repeatedly denounced the israeli scenario as a 
scheme to undercut palestinian aspirations for statehood 
baker telephoned arens with the news of the plos conditional 
acceptance arens told him the israeli government would study the 
response said ruth yaron spokeswoman for the israeli embassy 
a senior us official declining to be identified said that 
now that baker has qualified acceptance from the plo and israel 
he can get down to work on dealing with their views 
baker three months ago began an arduous diplomatic effort to 
bridge the gap between the plo and israel his plan includes the 
washington meeting with arens and meguid 
another provision of his fivepoint program released by ms 
tutwiler is that the united states understands that israel will 
attend the dialogue only after a satisfactory list of palestinians 
has been worked out 
a third provision guarantees that egypt will consult with 
palestinians on all aspects of the dialogue 
a fourth assures the palestinians that those who meet with 
israel would be free to raise issues that relate to their 
opinions on how to make elections and the negotiating process 
succeed 
this could be a vehicle for palestinians to assert statehood 
aspirations and also to register demands extending beyond the 
limited selfrule shamir envisions for five years on the west bank 
and in gaza 
for the past two years palestinians in the territories have 
clashed with israeli authorities at least 626 have died in the 
process while 155 other palestinians were killed by arabs on 
suspicion of cooperating with israel also 43 israeli soldiers and 
civilians died in the rebellion 
the baker formula makes no direct reference to the plo with 
which the united states opened talks a year ago after arafat 
publicly renounced terrorism and said he accepted the existence of 
israel 
robert pelletreau jr the us ambassador to tunisia has been 
meeting with plo officials while baker conducted negotiations 
through meguid 
ms tutwiler called the egyptian reply a step forward for 
the peace process last week in bakers behalf she had ruled out 
any us action on the plos reservations until it first accepted 
his formula 
we have now received from the government of egypt a positive 
response to secretary bakers fivepoint framework ms tutwiler 
said 
we will be working with the parties on steps needed to get to 
a trilateral meeting in washington as part of a process for 
launching an israelipalestinian dialogue

vice president dan quayle says the united 
states should not get too hung up on soviet president mikhail s 
gorbachevs charming manner while pointing out that foreigners 
like him more than his own countrymen do 
the personality can help bring about these reforms and we 
should encourage that quayle said in a televised interview 
wednesday on the cable news networks larry king live show 
the president wants to encourage that and he wants to offer 
help to chairman gorbachev to have these reforms the vice 
president said but instead of getting caught up in the magnetic 
personality of chairman gorbachev weve got to look beyond that 
and see if there are true lasting reforms taking place 
following president bushs meetings at malta with gorbachev last 
week quayle expressed skepticism about soviet foreign policy 
saying in a published interview monday that the kremlin still wants 
to create instability in other nations 
while that view seemed to contrast with the friendly nature of 
the talks between bush and gorbachev white house officials moved 
quickly to say there was no disagreement between the president and 
the vice president 
before the vice presidents televised remarks wednesday soviet 
spokesman gennady i gerasimov said quayles views on soviet 
foreign policy sounded strange 
quayle has consistently taken a tougher view of the soviet union 
than other administration officials and while he spoke well of 
gorbachev during wednesdays interview he said relations should 
not be based on one man 
we want him to succeed in perestroika we want him to succeed 
in glasnost quayle said 
but sometime gorbachev will not sometime down the road will 
not be the leader of the soviet union he said 
his popularity is probably greater outside the soviet union 
than in the soviet union quayle said 
recent polls in the united states west germany and the soviet 
union support quayles observations on gorbachevs popularity the 
first time a high us official has said such things 
a survey for the west german magazine der spiegel last summer 
found 82 percent of 2000 voters polled were convinced that 
gorbachevs reform policies in the soviet union will succeed a 
parallel survey of 1000 moscow citizens conducted for the magazine 
by the soviet academy of sciences found that 59 percent thought 
perestroika will succeed 
in sheer popularity der spiegel found that gorbachev rated 
higher than west german chancellor helmut kohl in the united 
states a media generalassociated press poll last month found that 
bush and gorbachev have roughly equal popularity in this country

the handwritten letter blamed unspecified failures in the 
gunmans life on unidentified women and said he was going to kill 
some women in revenge said jacques duscheneau a montreal police 
senior investigator 
the man began the rampage in a firstfloor cafeteria where he 
killed three women st laurent said 
the gunman then went up to the second floor and walked into a 
packed classroom ordering the men into one corner of the room and 
the women into another police said 
he told the men to leave they did so and police said the 
gunman screamed before opening fire on the women youre all a 
bunch of feminists 
six slain women were later found in the classroom on the same 
floor he killed a woman in an administration office 
then he climbed to the third floor where he shot four more 
women in the corridor it was a human hunt and we were the 
quarry said one witness 
he continued up to the fourth and fifth floors shooting and 
wounding both men and women 
then police say he returned to the third floor and turned the 
gun on himself 
st laurent at one point told reporters police were looking for 
two accomplices but said later he was mistaken and the man acted 
alone 
i saw the bodies of the people who were slain they were all 
women said louis courville director of the engineering school 
his voice shaking 
one student said a bullet passed his leg and he brought his 
hands up in a pleading gesture the gunman left him alone 
he was clearly gunning for the women the student said 
all i know is that a crazy guy came in here and began shooting 
at anything that moved said dominique berube 22 one of scores 
of terrified students who ran from the building 
its our friends who have been killed 
she said some people threw themselves on the floor while others 
stood paralyzed 
the injured several in critical condition were taken to four 
hospitals 
frenzied parents rushed to the university and were told to 
gather at a central location 
i saw death close up and i shook said student vanthona ouy 
22 
witnesses told police the gunman entered the classroom at about 
520 pm est 
students said the man emerged from the classroom fired three or 
four shots at a group of people and ran up a flight of stairs 
student francois bordeleau said he had to drag people by the 
collar to keep them from going in the mans direction 
he said he heard 20 to 30 shots and the man appeared to be 
aiming mainly at women 
i heard the gunman say i want the women said bordeleau 
several other witnesses confirmed that the gunman said that 
student eric chavarie said the gunman told us to stop 
everything and then when we looked at him we thought it was a 
joke but he fired a shot in the air and separated us into two 
groups the guys in one corner and the girls in another corner 
when that was done he asked the guys to leave he left the 
girls in there we got outside in the hallway and for a couple of 
minutes he stayed in there and after when he got out he leveled his 
gun at a group of people who were there and he shot three or four 
shots 
i saw some people fall 
lucien justin who was in the computer room said the assailant 
first aimed at the wall there and then ran out 
somebody locked the door but he shot off the lock and then 
left a second time he said 
i was terribly afraid i ran like hell 
who could have thought that something like this could happen 
in a peaceful student world said ba madou 35 an engineering 
student 
people thought it was a joke said stephane meunier an 
engineering student people were in a state of shock 
at the montreal general hospital doug lemm assistant director 
of security said staff were at a christmas party in the cafeteria 
when victims began to arrive 
he said the timing could not have been more fortunate 
the party was scheduled from 3 pm to 8 pm and there was no 
booze we called all the doctors and nurses to the operating room

a federal lawsuit against the owners of 
a missing lobster boat alleges that the vessel was unseaworthy and 
its crew inadequately trained 
the suit was brought in us district court in new haven by the 
parents brother and sister of 22yearold michael hare one of the 
five men aboard the missing heidi marie it seeks unspecified 
damages 
hare of pawcatuck also had been a crewman on the sophie g 
another lobster boat owned by garbo enterprises inc of stonington 
when it sank in 1988 without loss of life 
the coast guard called off its search for the heidi marie on 
friday after spending 11 days searching more than 100000 square 
miles of ocean for the 72foot lobster boat the vessel was last 
heard from nov 21 and was believed to have gone down in the north 
atlantic 
the lawsuit filed monday charged that the presumed death of 
hare was a result of negligence by the vessels owners and 
operators bfd fisheries inc garbo enterprises inc james garbo 
sr james garbo jr and david garbo 
a woman who would only identify herself as the office manager at 
garbo enterprises said wednesday the garbos would be unavailable to 
comment on the lawsuit its a very tragic situation they are 
really not able to cope with any interviews at this point she 
said 
according to the lawsuit the owners and operators of the heidi 
marie ordered the boat to sail either without getting available 
weather information or after ignoring weather information 
extremely poor weather hampered the search and presumably caused 
the loss of the vessel 
the lawsuit charges that the boat lacked adequate safety and 
navigational equipment the crew lacked adequate training and the 
vessel was not a safe place to work 
filing the suit were hares parents lewis and roberta hare 
brother alan m hare and sister jennifer r lensis

the united states should press for additional 
cuts in strategic nuclear weapons once it finishes negotiating a 
pact to reduce those weapons by as much as half a former us arms 
negotiator says 
certainly we can afford to be more ambitious in our arms 
control proposals former arms negotiator paul warnke said 
wednesday in a speech to the arms control association a private 
research group 
under the start strategic arms reduction treaty agreement now 
being negotiated us and soviet longrange bombers missiles and 
submarines would be cut by 30 percent to 50 percent 
warnke said that agreement could be completed and signed at the 
summit president bush and soviet president mikhail s gorbachev 
plan to hold in washington next june a meeting the two leaders 
agreed to at the malta summit last week 
there is no reason at all we cant go ahead with a start 2 
treaty warnke said 
such a second treaty should aim at banning missiles with 
multiple warheads warnke said 
warnke argued that soviet troop withdrawals from eastern europe 
and the political changes sweeping the warsaw pact countries mean 
fewer nuclear weapons are needed to defend the west 
he said the major obstacle in the strategic arms reduction talks 
in geneva was the us program to devise a space shield against 
ballistic missile attack 
but that idea left town with mr reagan warnke said of the 
us strategic defense initiative championed by the former 
president but viewed with skepticism by many in congress and most 
arms control experts 
a ban on missiles with multiple warheads would eliminate the 
threat of a nuclear first strike by either side warnke suggested 
such an attack would require so many singlewarhead missiles the 
aggressor would be unable to defend against nuclear retaliation 
and therefore would not launch an attack he argued 
but warnke who was former president carters chief negotiator 
stressed the two sides should complete the current start treaty 
first before making deeper cuts in their strategic weapons 
congress has approved a bush administration plan to extend the 
us arsenal of landbased missiles armed with multiple warheads 
that could reach all targets within the soviet union by putting 
some on rail cars that could move around in a crisis making them 
harder for the soviets to destroy 
warnke said that probably was a lousy idea and would 
escalate nuclear tensions

stan price who became a symbol of 
peaceful coexistence between humans and brown bears has died of 
cancer he was 90 
price known as the bear man of pack creek died tuesday at 
the home of his greatnephew gary lingle of juneau where he had 
been living since october 
he lived for 40 years along the shores of pack creek on 
admiralty island which attracts thousands of visitors to see the 
worlds largest concentration of brown bears 
but price himself also was an attraction a small whitehaired 
man who casually strolled among the fearsomelooking bruins which 
can weigh more than 1000 pounds with nothing more than a walking 
stick for protection 
a native of missouri price arrived in southeast alaska in 1927 
in a sailboat he had built in seattle in 1928 he set up a mining 
and logging operation at windham bay not far from pack creek 30 
miles south of juneau he also worked as a mechanic fisherman and 
fox farmer 
in the 20 years that he regularly visited his greatuncle 
lingle said he always felt safe walking with price because of the 
special relationship he had with the bears 
he always said if youre friends with the bears the bears 
will be friends with you lingle said he had a mutual respect 
with the bears and the proof is that he lived there for 40 years 
with only one incident 
that occurred on a narrow path between prices woodshed and his 
house on a beach price and a brown bear surprised each other and a 
face off began with neither backing down the big brownie finally 
swatted price breaking his collarbone 
despite living in close quarters with about 25 brown bears that 
roam the pack creek area price never carried a rifle a quick bop 
on the nose with his walking stick was usually sufficient if a bear 
got testy 
as word of prices special relationship with the bears spread 
films television shows and magazines told his story during the 
1980s the number of visitors to pack creek increased dramatically 
he had a gentleness and a special way of communicating with 
the bears said joel bennett a juneau wildlife filmmaker and 
alaska board of game member he didnt subscribe to the theory 
that they were marauding killers lurking behind every tree 
bennett said price would walk to within 6 feet of the animals 
and talk to them 
this is the passing of a grand old man that represents a 
unique part of the heritage of alaska bennett said his legacy 
is that people can coexist with wildlife peacefully if we try he 
taught that by example 
survivors include prices second wife esther who lives in 
arkansas and has alzheimers disease lingle said his first wife 
died of cancer

the use of us fighter jets to 
support president corazon aquino during the attempted coup has 
triggered nationalist outrage and added a new element to talks on 
us bases negotiations 
while rebels made threatening statements toward the 
approximately 100000 us citizens in the philippines in response 
to washingtons decision they took no action against americans 
trapped in rebelheld hotels 
indeed public indignation largely has focused on mrs aquinos 
reliance on us military help in crushing the coup the most 
serious since she took office in february 1986 
when push came to shove this government yelled for the 
yanks i for one am ashamed wrote respected political 
commentator max v soliven in the philippine daily star 
when a government cannot overcome a rebellion without 
outside help i hope that this does not make it a colony a 
satrap or a banana republic all over again said soliven 
recalling the halfcentury when the philippines was a us colony 
how the nations socalled leaders could possibly justify 
our complete dependence and subservience to a former colonial 
master truly blows the mind chimed in columnist noel c cabrera 
in the manila times 
us f4 phantom jets flew air cover friday for loyalist forces 
the jets did not fire on the rebels but prevented them from 
continuing air strikes targeting the presidential palace and 
military camps 
mrs aquino had requested military assistance in a telephone 
call to president bush during the first hours of the coup when the 
survival of her government appeared in doubt 
the air support has been widely viewed as the turning point 
the jets took off from clark air base about 50 miles north of 
manila it is one of six us military bases in the philippines 
with leases expiring in 1991 
the future of the strategic bases is one of the hotest political 
topics in the philippines and the debate has intensified with the 
us intervention in the attempted coup 
base supporters have argued that the installations give the 
economy a needed shot in the arm and provide strategic protection 
from foreign aggression 
opponents have claimed the bases although technically under 
philippine control are usrun and therefore an affront on 
national sovereignty 
mrs aquinos use of phantoms from clark however has added a 
new element to the debate the bases as ultimate guarantor of 
democracy in the philippines 
a resolution drafted wednesday by the opposition nacionalista 
party of vice president salvador laurel says the bases are not 
designed to promote mutual security but to perpetrate us hegemony 
in the philippines 
it calls for nonrenewal of the bases treaties and abrogation of 
the bilateral mutual security treaty 
but house speaker ramon mitra said the us assistance was 
just to show the enemy of the people that there is another force 
which will support president aquino at a time when our democracy is 
endangered it is a nice feeling to have when you need assistance 
it is there what would have happened if it did not come 
although mrs aquino has not expressed a clear position on the 
bases she has been willing to negotiate new leases which would be 
subject to senate approval 
talks that were expected to begin this month may now be delayed 
until 1990 because of the coup attempt 
a senior official at the us embassy speaking on condition he 
not be further identified said there was nothing magic about a 
december start to negotiations and said a timetable would depend on 
the philippine side 
he said he did not believe us involvement would make the talks 
more difficult claiming that a large number of people were 
very happy the support came when it did 
there has been no sign of widespread antiamerican sentiment in 
the wake of the coup attempt this archipelago nation benefits from 
much american aid and investment and has absorbed much of popular 
us culture 
in fact when filipinos were asked to temporarily house 
foreigners escaping the heavy fighting in the makati financial 
district over the weekend several people specifically asked for 
americans to be their guests 
even rebels refused to move against us citizens they held in 
makati hotels saying these american tourists are not our enemy 
but a statement issued in the name of a rebel leader advised the 
us government to evacuate its nationals and urged americans to 
pressure washington to refrain from pursuing any policy or action 
which may trigger a new philippineamerican war

hanko dewitz raced up on his 
bicycle for his fourhour watch at secret police headquarters his 
mission prevent communist officials from destroying evidence in a 
widening weapons scandal 
the excited young supporter of the opposition new forum group 
had to wait until classes were out wednesday before he pedaled 
through this baltic port to take up watch 
across east germany there are similar strange scenes angry 
citizens have this week surrounded and in some cases stormed 
local headquarters of the oncedreaded secret police 
we check all material coming in and going out of this 
building we are here to make sure the police dont burn the 
papers we control this building said dewitz a 24yearold 
medical student 
supporters of new forum the largest opposition group in east 
germany occupied the building monday upon hearing reports that 
communist officials were involved in illegal weapons export from a 
nearby factory 
there were also reports of the burning of documents 
the focus of anger is the imes factory at kavelstorf a village 
on a rolling plain about 10 miles south of rostock new forum says 
it discovered cases of weapons among piles of household goods that 
the plant normally produces 
the plant is now occupied by police and a representative of new 
forum is present at all times 
a handlettered sign on the fence says new forum kavelstorf 
and an east german flag with a white dove stitched on calls for 
demilitarization 
the group charges that the weapons were exported for hard 
currency the head of the firm has been arrested and alexander 
schalckgolodkowski the government official who oversaw the 
operation has turned himself to authorities in west germany where 
he had fled 
a secretary in the mayors office of kavelstorf had this comment 
on the affair disgusting 
said a local mechanic everybody from the top party boss to 
the little local party leader was corrupt 
the case has been turned over to the state prosecutors office 
which has put five lawyers on it the people are being represented 
by new forum 
the scandal is the talk of the town and by afternoon the local 
ostzee zeitung newspaper is now sold out once a communist party 
mouthpiece the daily now prints full reports of opposition 
activities and even lists planned demonstrations 
throughout east germany the opposition has set itself a tall 
order to make sure that 40 years of incriminating documents do not 
vanish 
in addition to its 24hour guard inside the secret police 
building new forum has taken over a garage that serviced cars 
belonging to the police 
the activists are allowing no information to be radioed out and 
they say they have halted the burning of documents likely to 
incriminate secret police

the swapping of classified pentagon 
budget documents by employees of nine major defense contractors was 
endemic according to a witness at the federal trial of a 
former boeing co employee 
the informal network of document trading existed in the late 
1970s and early 1980s government witnesses said wednesday it was 
the third day of the trial of richard lee fowler a former boeing 
worker accused of illegally obtaining secret defense department 
documents 
fowler has pleaded innocent to 39 counts including conspiracy 
illegal conveyance of classified documents and mail fraud boeing 
earlier pleaded guilty to receiving classified documents and will 
pay a 52 million fine 
among the companies implicated in the document trading network 
besides boeing were honeywell bendix ibm rca grumman raytheon 
rockwell and martin marietta 
i would describe it as endemic linda coutre a bendix 
employee from 1972 to 1984 said of the document swaps 
ms coutre said everyone seemed to have the socalled 
planning programming and budget system documents and she 
exchanged documents with fowler and employees of other defense 
companies 
the documents were never entered in bendixs classified document 
log ms coutre said adding that she kept the documents in a file 
cabinet or a safe and when they became outdated she would shred 
them or burn them in her fireplace 
ms coutre said she never asked fowler or others where they got 
the documents 
it was an unspoken agreement that no one asked that 
question she said we didnt want to get people in trouble 
ms coutre who was granted immunity from prosecution by us 
attorneys said the documents gave defense contractors some 
indication of how serious the pentagon was about pursuing various 
projects 
they were used primarily to support business decisions she 
said we had to look at the opportunities from the department of 
defense and make decisions on whether to invest money we wanted to 
make sure the government was serious about the opportunities before 
we went forward 
philip jackson an rca employee from 1979 to 1984 said he also 
swapped documents but the top source of supply was fowler 
jackson said fowlers supply of documents seemed to be 
continuous and quick and on at least two occasions fowler handed 
him documents from the trunk of his car parked in the garage at 
boeings rosslyn va office 
it was my sense that every major contractor had them 
jackson said 
jackson who was also granted immunity from prosecution said he 
never asked anyone what their source was it was just not done 
it was not the gentlemanly way to do things 
but jackson said he had the distinct impression that fowler 
got the documents from the pentagon and he thought fowler was 
encouraging others in the network to develop pentagon sources 
max franklin who worked both for martin marietta and ibm said 
that he too swapped documents with fowler and others 
franklin who was called as a defense witness said he didnt 
feel that exchanging the classified documents was illegal and that 
defense contractors had a legitimate right to know what was in the 
documents 
franklin said fowler was described by others as the best in 
the business in terms of getting the documents but denied that 
he had heard fowler described as the mother lode 
in earlier testimony wednesday a retired honeywell employee 
said he and other company employees were under pressure to get the 
secret budget documents 
frank lozito said when he was asked by his supervisor to get 
classified air force budget documents he turned to fowler an old 
friend for help 
lozito who also was granted immunity said he got documents 
from fowler five or 10 times a year from 1979 to early 1984

a judge who grew up in the same neighborhood 
as the defendant sentenced him to life in prison without parole for 
possessing 5 ounces of crack 
i dont feel any pity for him because he set the agenda for 
himself us district judge david w williams said wednesday in 
sentencing richard van winrow 
winrow 22 was sentenced under a 1988 federal narcotics 
trafficking statute that provides for severe mandatory penalties 
for people with multiple drug offenses 
winrow was arrested in december 1988 in a raid on his mothers 
home he was convicted in august of possession with intent to 
distribute 5 ounces of crack the potent highly addictive 
smokeable form of cocaine 
he had three prior convictions for cocaine possession and was on 
probation when he was arrested under the antidrug abuse 
amendments act of 1988 winrow faced a minimum of 20 years in 
prison and a maximum of life without parole williams chose the 
maximum 
we have one or two things in common the 79yearold judge 
told winrow we are the same race and we come from the same 
neighborhood 
the judge who is black noted he grew up about a mile from 
winrows mothers home in southcentral los angeles 
i know that neighborhood and i know how its changed 
williams continued the man is making it one of the neighborhoods 
you cant live in cant walk down the streets on my people are 
the victims 
winrows attorney david chesnoff argued against the sentence 
he contended the federal statute violates the constitution by 
representing cruel and unusual punishment taking discretion away 
from judges and failing to match the severity of the crime 
but williams said the sentence though harsh was constitutional 
congress has gone out to battle the drug war and this man is 
one of the enemies the judge said

despite popular opinion that global warming 
will disrupt earths climate scientists are still debating whether 
the greenhouse effect has started and how bad it will get 
the scientific community is by no means unanimous 
massachusetts institute of technology meteorologist dick lindzen 
said wednesday 
because of uncertainty that automobile and industrial pollutants 
are heating up earths climate i would be loathe to tell detroit 
they cant build big cars any more or tell exxon to cut oil 
production said climate researcher tim barnett of the scripps 
institution of oceanography in la jolla 
debate over global warming took place at the american 
geophysical unions fall meeting 
the greenhouse effect theory says that carbon dioxide and 
other gases emitted by burning industrial and automobile fuel is 
accumulating in earths atmosphere acting like greenhouse glass to 
trap heat from sunlight 
computer simulations suggest that by the middle of the next 
century earths average temperature may rise 4 to 9 degrees 
fahrenheit possibly altering storm patterns triggering droughts 
and crop failures and raising sea levels to flood lowlying coastal 
areas 
if humans keep burning fossil fuels at present rates adding 
more carbon dioxide to the atmosphere by the year 2050 were 
going to have tremendous climate changes far outside what man has 
ever experienced said james hansen director of nasas goddard 
institute for space studies 
lindzen countered its equally easy to support scenarios 
where nothing happens 
he argued that a warming of earths surface spurs creation of 
more cumulus clouds and makes them rise higher which in turn 
blocks enough sunlight to counteract greenhouse heating 
barnett said the greenhouse effects potential consequences 
are scary as hell but he and others question whether computer 
forecasts of climatological doom are valid 
thats because so far they have been unable to find evidence to 
link greenhouse gases to the onehalfdegree warming observed 
during the past century 
analysis of warming since 1881 shows that most of that increase 
in global temperature happened before 1919 before the more 
recent sharp rise in the amount of carbon dioxide in the 
atmosphere said thomas karl of the national oceanic and 
atmospheric administrations national climatic data center in 
asheville nc 
while global climate warmed overall since 1881 it actually 
cooled during the period from 1921 to 1979 before warming again 
karl said 
in spite of all the wellpublicized concern about global 
warming you must understand that there is still considerable 
uncertainty among scientific experts about a number of critical 
factors which determine global warming noaa administrator john 
knauss said in a statement 
the researchers agreed they need to stop arguing and do better 
research to learn if the greenhouse effect is under way and will be 
as severe as hansen and others believe 
hansen spurred controversy when he told a us senate committee 
hearing during the hot dry summer of 1988 that he was almost 
certain greenhouse warming already had begun 
other scientists at wednesdays news conference said that if 
thats true they cant detect such warming since it is so small 
compared to temperature variations caused by changes in solar heat 
output and other natural factors 
hansen said that to reduce the prospects for radical climate 
change there many things that can be done without great cost 
such steps include phasing out chlorofluorocarbon gases which 
harm earths protective ozone shield and warm the atmosphere 
improving energy efficiency to reduce fuel burning and recycling 
newspapers to save trees that consume carbon dioxide he said

growing evidence shows a monstrous 
earthquake could wallop the woefully unprepared pacific northwest 
followed by tidal waves that would swamp coastal areas of oregon 
and washington scientists say 
the chances are very high that a great earthquake will occur 
yet seismic building codes are notoriously out of date said 
university of oregon geophysicist paul vincent 
craig weaver a us geological survey geophysicist in seattle 
called the regions ability to prevent death and damage from 
earthquakes abysmal 
were not prepared in the pacific northwest he said 
while some scientists remain skeptical evidence accumulated 
during the last five years indicates six quakes with magnitudes of 
8 to 9 rocked the region during the past 3500 years making 
coastal areas suddenly drop so that tsunamis or seismic tidal 
waves inundated the shoreline the last such quake was about 300 
years ago 
more studies showing such quakes have occurred and are likely to 
strike again were released wednesday during the american 
geophysical unions fall meeting 
residents of the northwest should be ready for an earthquake 
at any time although no one knows how soon weaver said 
one study found the oregon coast near tillamook has been rising 
and tilting eastward much more quickly during the past 50 years 
than it has on average in 80000 to 100000 years 
that indicates that stress is building underground and will be 
released in a quake measuring 8 to 9 on the richter scale any time 
within the next 150 years according to scientists from the 
university of california berkeley 
the study was conducted by vincent and ray weldon at the 
university of oregon and mark richards at berkeley 
dozens of dead western cedar trees along washingtons southern 
coast were studied by david yamaguchi a forester at the university 
of colorado at boulder yamaguchi said that by dating the trees 
rings he determined they all died suddenly about 300 years ago 
when coastal land suddenly dropped during a major quake and 
tsunamis submerged the trees 
yamaguchi said the trees were found along a 60mile coastal 
stretch suggesting the quake measured 8 on the richter scale 
mary reinhart of the university of washington presented a study 
showing 300yearold peat buried by sand has been found along at 
least a 120mile stretch of the oregonwashington coast she said 
it indicates a 40foothigh tsunami dumped sand on coastal 
estuaries in a big quake three centuries ago 
richards said oregon is severely unprepared for the great 
seismic hazard the lack of recent big quakes lulled oregonians 
into a false sense of security and the state has made little 
progress updating building codes to take large quakes into account 
he added 
weaver said washington state is slightly better prepared because 
building standards were improved after a magnitude71 quake in 
olympia in 1949 and a magnitude65 quake near seattle in 1965 the 
two quakes killed 17 people 
geological survey geologist bob buckham found new evidence that 
one and possibly two quakes measuring about 7 rocked seattle at 
least 1200 years ago 
he found that land on bainbridge island west of seattle was 
suddenly uplifted by as much as 23 feet at the time a 
magnitude73 quake in algeria several years ago raised land there 
by about 16 feet 
two large plates of earths crust collide off the pacific 
northwest the juan de fuca plate which is under the seafloor is 
diving eastward under the north american plate beneath oregon and 
washington in a process is called subduction 
quakes can happen in subduction zones when one plate sticks to 
the other until so much stress builds up they snap apart in a giant

that caused the 1985 mexico earthquakes which killed about 
10000 people and the two largest quakes ever recorded the 1960

lynn sykes of columbia universitys lamont doherty geological 
observatory said other scientists have too quickly jumped on the 
big earthquake scenario for the northwest 
he believes the juan de fuca plate is warmer and softer than the 
plates off alaska mexico and chile in that case the plate could 
dive smoothly under north america without sticking and snapping 
but richards said if that were true the northwest would have 
the only major subduction zone which does not cause substantial 
earthquakes

two former allies on mickey lelands peoples 
five slate of young black legislative candidates have become 
political foes in the race to succeed the congressman who died in a 
plane crash 
state sen craig washington and city councilman anthony hall 
face eachother in saturdays nonpartisan runoff election for 
lelands 18th congressional district seat leland was killed aug 7 
during a famine relief mission to ethiopia 
in the early 1970s all three men worked for civil rights fair 
housing health care for the poor food for the hungry and other 
social concerns they were the only successful candidates from the 
democratic peoples five slate who sought to represent houston 
in the state house 
now washington and hall have spent weeks trying to establish 
their political differences and prove their interest in 
representing a district said to be among the nations poorest 
my campaign is a movement said washington its an 
opportunity for people to get involved in politics again 
an attorney and a former law school instructor washington 48 
has been state senator since 1983 after serving 10 years in the 
house 
he captured 41 percent of the vote in the nov 7 election 
compared with 34 percent for hall the two topped a field of 11 
candidates seeking to succeed leland 
the term expires in 1990 
i won in the black community and the white community and the 
hispanic community washington said and i intend to do exactly 
the same thing on dec 9 
a poll published monday by kprctv showed the race is nearly 
deadlocked the kprc poll said 41 percent of voters favor hall 
while 38 percent were for washington twentyone percent said they 
were undecided and the poll had a 5 point margin of error 
hall 45 has a more buttoneddown style also an attorney he 
gained early notice as a decorated vietnam veteran who returned to 
houston questioning discriminatory practices in housing and 
employment more recently he has worked to set up 50 just say 
no antidrug programs for 1300 students 
i have a vision that indeed we can do better than we do now at 
solving the problems that we face as a community said hall a 
threeterm legislator who has served as councilman since 1979 
hall who had been a high school friend of lelands lost a 
bitter battle to him for the congressional seat in 1978 when the 
two fought to succeed barbara jordan 
hall had to give up his reelection bid for the council to run 
for congress mayor kathy whitmire has endorsed his bid for 
congress and helped him raise money 
washington and hall agree many issues both favor increased 
funding to battle drug trafficking and abuse and for health care 
to the poor and elderly and military cutbacks in central america 
what differences there are largely is a matter of style 
says franklin jones a political scientist at texas southern 
university washington comes off as the more grassroots kinds of 
campaigner more of the peoples candidate while hall has the 
more polished image as the sort of professional candidate but 
both of them are extremely professional and longterm political 
people

one in every 130 children require hospital care 
each year for injuries resulting from fights suicide attempts and 
other intentional acts of violence according to a study published 
today 
intentional injuries are now recognized as a major cause of 
death among children and teenagers in the united states the 
latest research was intended to see how often violence results in 
significant but nonfatal injuries 
the study based on massachusetts data gathered a decade ago 
found that such harm is relatively common especially among city 
dwellers and poor people 
it found that intentional injuries made up 3 percent of all 
injuries to children and teenagers they led to 10 percent of all 
hospitalizations and 16 percent of all injuryrelated deaths 
overall 85 percent of the intentional injuries resulted from 
assaults such as fights rape and child battering 
the analysis was conducted by dr bernard guyer and colleagues 
from the harvard school of public health and boston university 
school of medicine it was conducted between 1979 and 1982 in 14 
massachusetts communities and published in the new england journal 
of medicine 
among the findings 
one in 42 adolescent boys was treated annually for an 
assaultrelated injury usually resulting from a fight 
boys were almost twice as likely as girls to seek care for 
intentional injuries 
one exception was suicide attempts which were nearly twice as 
frequent among girls one in every 303 adolescent girls needed 
hospital care for a selfinflicted injury each year 
nearly onequarter of the rapes occured in girls under age 10 
assaultrelated injuries were three times as common in cities 
as in suburbs

stung by electoral successes of the extreme right 
and fierce debate over rights for moslems the government has 
appointed a troubleshooter to formulate new policy for integrating 
immigrants into french society 
premier michel rocard on wednesday named hubert prevot as 
permanent secretary of a government committee that will grapple 
with what has become the leading issue in domestic politics 
the economic situation of france no longer permits us to be a 
land of immigration government spokesman louis le pensec said 
after the appointment was announced at the weekly cabinet meeting 
its now a question of integrating foreigners who have come to 
make their homes here and wish to live here permanently le 
pensec said 
prevot 61 will head a task force of 13 ministers to grapple 
with the issues of integrating moslems into the secular school 
system the definition of a political refugee illegal workers and 
immigrant housing 
the panel will submit conclusions to the government sometime 
after jan 31 
the creation of the task force represents a victory for the 
extremeright national front headed by jeanmarie le pen who has 
fulfilled a longheld goal of putting immigration high on the 
governments agenda 
it comes the same day mariefrance stirbois took the partys 
first seat in the national assembly since electoral reforms in 
1988 mrs stirbois won the seat for suburban dreux in a runoff 
election sunday 
immigration exploded into a frontpage issue in october after 
three girls with north african origins insisted on wearing islamic 
scarves to their junior high school 
french law dating to the turn of the century separates church 
and state all forms of proselytizing and wearing of religious 
symbols are prohibited in the secular school system 
though two of the girls removed their scarves and returned to 
class on saturday they ignited fresh debate over whether some 
immigrants can be absorbed into french culture 
le pen has pushed the issue for years arguing that social 
payments to immigrants cut into benefits for native french 
citizens his party fares well in areas like dreux that have a high 
population of noneuropean immigrants 
in an interview published in wednesdays edition of the 
conservative newspaper le figaro le pen urged the government to 
expel all foreigners who arrived in france after 1974 
le pen says a law passed that year that restricted immigration 
to political asylum or reuniting families is widely flouted 
wisdom would dictate reducing the number of foreigners in 
france and reversing the flood le pen was quoted as saying in 
10 years there will be 100 million people living in north africa 
what is their hope to come to france 
he continued is that the solution of course not the 
solution is the development of the underdeveloped countries the 
national front has won 9 to 145 percent of the vote nationwide 
vote in recent elections 
the debate over immigration almost never mentions immigrants 
from north america or europe but focuses instead on arab north 
africa and black west africa where many countries are former 
french colonies or protectorates 
a survey of 926 people conducted by the polling service bva 
showed 68 percent of the french think the level of tolerance has 
been reached for immigration and 50 percent oppose the 
construction of new mosques 
the last national census taken in 1982 showed 36 million 
immigrants living in france the ministry of the interior puts the 
current figure at 45 million or about 8 percent of a total 
population of 55 million 
the ministrys last breakdown in 1985 showed portuguese as the 
most numerous immigrant population at 846488 followed by 
algerians at 725049 moroccans at 558799 italians at 378339 
spaniards at 353232 tunisians at 225730 and turks at 160140

actor john payne kris kringles lawyer 
who proved that santa claus exists in the 1947 christmas film 
classic miracle on 34th street has died he was 77 
payne a leading man in hollywood musicals and dramas during the 
1940s and 1950s died his home here wednesday said robert palmer 
a longtime friend and former publicist he suffered from heart 
problems 
paynes third wife actress alexandra sandy crowell curtis 
and his three children from previous marriages were with him when 
he died palmer said 
miracle on 34th street which won three oscars and has 
become a christmas tv tradition also starred maureen ohara 
edmund gwenn and an 8yearold natalie wood as a girl who didnt 
believe in santa claus 
paynes character is called upon to defend kringle the 
department store santa who faces court proceedings because of his 
insistence he is really santa claus 
the lawyer wins by getting postal officials to deliver to 
kringle in court thousands of childrens letters for santa claus 
the judge decides not to refute a government agency and frees the 
kindly old man in time to make his christmas eve rounds 
payne took personal credit for getting the movie 
he spotted the valentine davies story in a magazine and overcame 
objections from 20th century fox studios to making a simple 
christmas story in an era of extravagant productions 
it was broadcast on local tv station tuesday 
he was very proud of that film said palmer in fact the 
night before he died he was unconscious in bed a television in 
the corner was playing that film it was strange looking at him in 
bed like that 
payne was born in roanoke va the son of a gentleman farmer 
who lost much of his wealth in the stock market crash of 1929 his 
mother was an opera singer 
payne studied drama and voice at juilliard and columbia 
university supporting himself with roles in lowbudget shubert 
shows 
he once had his own radio program on wnew in new york 
payne first made his mark in film as a leading man in several 
20th century fox musicals in the 1940s often starring opposite 
alice faye or betty grable 
his films include tin pan alley sun valley serenade 
hello frisco hello springtime in the rockies the dolly 
sisters the razors edge and sentimental journey 
in the 1950s payne switched to westerns and action pictures 
including passage west raiders of the seven seas and 
santa fe passage 
payne retired in the 1960s but went back to the stage with miss 
faye in the 1973 national revival of good news 
payne said of his acting career in 1974 i could never quite 
take it seriously 
it was all kind of fun it was a remunerative profession i 
certainly couldnt have earned that much money any other way that i 
can think of he said 
a memorial service was scheduled for saturday at st aidans 
episcopal church in malibu

customers of supermarkets with automatic 
checkout scanners were overcharged in 32 of the 33 stores checked 
by new york state inspectors this year officials said 
the 32 stores which include all of the major supermarket 
chains were fined a total of 5015 for the violations said 
joseph ferrara assistant director of food inspection services for 
the state department of agriculture and markets 
more than 5 percent of the items in a typical store are 
mispriced in favor of the supermarket ferrara said 
nonetheless state officials were unable to say wednesday 
whether the customers at the 32 stores ended up net winners or 
losers because of the scanners industry officials noted that the 
scanners might also be undercharging customers on some of the many 
items checked in each supermarket 
i think they consumers have to pay careful attention to the 
prices marked as opposed to the prices on the scanners ferrara 
said its not uncommon for them to be overcharged for items in 
stores that use scanners i guess buyer beware would probably be 
good advice 
michael rosen director of government relations for the state 
food merchants association said mistakes are made that both 
benefit and hurt consumers 
so while 32 of the 33 stores were found to be overcharging on 
some items they may have been undercharging on many others said 
the lobbyist 
people arent going to knowingly cheat their customers because 
theyll lose them rosen said you might fool someone once or 
twice but if you lose that person and they never come back youre 
not going to be in business for very long 
ferrara said inspectors posing as customers would go into 
stores and buy about 150 items or more comparing prices on the 
product with the receipt after checking out stores where 
discrepancies were found that hurt the consumers were fined 
many of the mistakes came in items that were advertised as on 
sale but the sale price hadnt been entered into the computer 
scanner he said

rebel troops chanting no surrender 
the fight goes on left the citys financial district and returned 
to their barracks today ending for the moment their bid to topple 
president corazon aquino 
but in cebu 350 miles south of manila about 400 rebels were 
not budging from mactan air base refusing to surrender unless new 
elections are called to replace mrs aquino whose term expires in 
june 1992 
civic and religious leaders negotiated with holdouts at mactan 
the last known stronghold of mutineers who launched the coup 
attempt on friday 
this is unconditional surrender said brig gen arturo 
enrile head of the philippine military academy who led 
negotiations throughout the night with rebel leaders in the 
financial district the problem is already finished 
but rebels who marched the 1 miles back to fort bonifacio were 
singing and chanting no surrender the fight goes on troops at 
the army base unfurled a white sheet at the gate saying welcome 
home 
as the mutineers marched past the exclusive forbes park 
neighborhood where us ambassador nicholas platt lives some 
residents stood on the street and cheered 
we have won some victories said rebel capt danilo lim 
we have made a very strong statement 
at least 79 people have been killed and more than 570 others 
wounded in the coup attempt it was the bloodiest of the six 
attempts to overthrow mrs aquino who took power in the february 
1986 civilianmilitary uprising that toppled the late president 
ferdinand e marcos 
mrs aquino who faced the gravest crisis of her administration 
said she was relieved the siege was over 
we must now all join hands and consolidate our resources to 
rebuild what has been destroyed she said in a written statement 
at mactan air base rebel leader brig gen jose commendador 
threatened to blow up all military aircraft unless his demands were 
met 
military chief of staff gen renato de villa begged commendador 
in a television statement to spare the aircraft saying they were 
needed for the fight against communist insurgents 
but as representatives of the two sides watched the telecast in 
cebu a rebel officer turned off the set before de villa appeared 
cardinal jaime l sin roman catholic archbishop of manila and 
the countrys leading cleric called on todayu his followers to 
join a mass rally friday in support of democracy 
the future of the nation is in your hands sin said in 
1986 hundreds of thousands joined sins call to turn out in the 
streets to support soldiers who had mutinied against marcos 
that triggered the people power revolution mrs aquino rode 
to power but much of her public support has now eroded amid 
charges of incompetence and corruption 
on wednesday mrs aquino declared a national state of emergency 
to deal with the crisis her staff was expected to send congress a 
list of new powers requested under the emergency decree 
rebels abandoned makati a day after about 1800 foreigners 
among them roughly 250 americans were evacuated from rebelheld 
luxury hotels there 
as they left the skyscrapers and hotels seized on saturday the 
mutineers sang the theme song of their scout ranger regiment 
rifles bazookas machine guns and bandoleers of ammunition were 
slung over their shoulders 
we will not surrender even if it takes forever said cpl 
roy bantung the government must change 
rebels have accused mrs aquino of failing to stamp out 
corruption reorganize the armed forces and deliver on promises of 
social justice 
the rebels seized hotels and buildings in makati on saturday 
the military said about 300 rebels surrendered today but the 
number appeared to be more than 500 
defense secretary fidel ramos estimated that about 3000 rebels 
joined the mutiny at its highpoint 
on sunday mrs aquino ruled out negotiations with the rebels 
and warned them surrender or die but in the end she relented 
and stepped aside to allow loyal military commanders to resolve the 
crisis peacefully 
most rebel officers in past coup attempts have simply been 
confined to barracks and many enlisted men were sent back into the 
ranks 
enrile said the rebels political demands which included the 
resignation of mrs aquino were nonnegotiable the rebels 
were believed to favor a civilianmilitary junta that would pave 
the way for new elections 
on friday us f4 phantom jets flew air cover for loyalist 
forces preventing the insurgents from continuing air strikes from 
villamor air base which the rebels seized in the coups first 
hours 
the us warplanes did not fire on the rebels 
public confidence has been shaken far more than by the other 
coup attempts 
jose fernandez governor of the central bank said wednesday 
that 91 million had been withdrawn in runs on manila banks many 
parts of the archipelago had cash shortages because domestic air 
service had been suspended

state gaming regulators have fined a 
casino 250000 for removing black and women employees from a table 
at the request of a bigstakes player 
the penalty approved unanimously by the casino control 
commission on wednesday stopped short of the closure suggested by 
the state division of gaming enforcement which did not propose any 
length to a shutdown 
however it exceeded an administrative law judges 
recommendation that the casino be fined 15600 the amount lost by 
robert libutti the player in question 
the fine was the second largest in new jerseys 11year casino 
history the largest was a 257000 penalty issued against caesars 
for allowing a patron to play from inside the pit among other 
charges 
in 1985 the gaming hall became the only casino to be closed for 
a day when it allowed a patron to lose more than 7 million without 
checking his source of credit 
a suspension of the operation certificate is not warranted in 
this instance said commission chairman walter n read but the 
evidence also establishes sufficiently aggravating circumstances to 
warrant nothing less than maximum penalties 
read cited the inherently abhorrent nature of race and 
sexbased discrimination and the gaming halls catering to high 
rollers the commission decision also requires caesars to conduct a 
training program emphasizing how to deal with highrollers 
libutti a 57yearold thoroughbred horse consultant from saddle 
river has said through his attorney that he never asked for the 
removal of dealers 
he is suing caesars and the division of gaming enforcement for 
making the allegations 
the gaming divisions discrimination complaint against caesars 
charges that on two occasions in may 1988 caesars removed black 
and women craps workers to accommodate libutti 
although the ruling was unanimous w david waters the lone 
black member of the fiveperson commission questioned its impact 
on caesars 
it is obvious that organizational or corporate penalties 
represent nothing more than the cost of doing business waters 
said if violations of this sort occur in the future i think 
this commission must consider assessing penalties against top 
management in order to hold them personally accountable 
caesars attorney gregory parliman said he was pleased that the 
commission decided not to accept the recommendation to suspend the 
license 
the casino collects about 851000 a day from patrons before 
expenses 
joel respes the black floorperson who was replaced also said 
he was satisfied by the ruling 
im happier with this decision than a 15000 fine respes 
said 
respes 36 said he still works for caesars but added it has 
not been easy 
i was vey humiliated he said my pride was hurt i 
couldnt believe the company would do such a thing

trial claimed he once gave panamanian gen manuel noriega a 
300000 present and implicated the manager of rock star bon jovi 
steven michael kalish 37 faced crossexamination today at the 
us district court trial of 23 men accused of an enormous 
smuggling conspiracy 
in testimony tuesday kalish said the panamanian government 
helped him get in and out of panama once warning him that the us 
drug enforcement agency was watching his jet so he could arrange 
for another 
kalish said he met noriega in the fall 1983 through cesar 
rodriguez and enrique pretel the panamanian strongmans partners 
in the firm of servicios touristicos 
kalish the 70th witness to testify in a trial which began in 
late october said he told rodriguez and pretel that he expected to 
have 100 million and needed adequate banking protection for the 
money 
soon afterward he met noriega the day after that he said he 
was taken to noriegas home and gave the general a 300000 gift 
i am rather impressed that i am in this mans house said 
kalish who often spoke of the past in the present tense 
he said noriega agreed to help with banking channels in panama 
and noriega rodriguez and pretel divided a 5 percent commission on 
25 million sent to deposit in panamas bank of commerce credit 
international 
kalish also testified tuesday that harold doc mcghee 
manager of the rock groups bon jovi skid row and the scorpions 
was the link between the smugglers and a colombian drug supplier 
at a meeting in miami kalish testified mcghee was told to ask 
one of his associates paul vargas of baranquilla colombia to 
supply a boat loaded with 40000 to 50000 pounds of marijuana for 
shipment to north carolina in november 1982 
the colombian navy seized the boat and towed it to cartegena 
colombia he said but kalish testified a 100000 bribe from 
vargas paid with the assurance that mcghee would repay vargas in 
miami persuaded the colombian crew to let the drug boat free and 
help load it 
mcghee who got a suspended sentence after pleading guilty to 
marijuana importation charges in us district court in north 
carolina faces more charges in lafayette where he is among about 
two dozen defendants to be tried later 
kalish described their marijuana enterprise as a 
multimilliondollar business with so much cash that banks couldnt 
handle it at one point he said the organization had 40 
million and no place to put it 
organization members are accused of smuggling about 48000 
pounds of marijuana into north carolina in 1982 nearly 300000 
pounds into louisiana in 1983 and plotting to bring one million 
pounds into missouri in 1984 
the 1984 operation never materialized however because kalish 
was arrested for racketeering he subsequently pleaded guilty to 
continual criminal enterprise and was sentenced to 14 years in 
prison 
the prison term later was reduced to 10 years after kalish began 
cooperating with federal authorities 
in testimony about another defendant michael lyons kalish 
testified that he visited an ohio farm soon after the delivery of 
280000 pounds of marijuana to a shipyard near abbeville la he 
said some of the marijuana had been taken to the farm for

shots screams echo through the halls for a second jeanrobert 
cadieux thinks it is only a preexam prank 
one of my friends said if its a gag its a good one 
theres a bloody corpse by the photocopy machine said the

classrooms and corridors wednesday of the engineering school at the 
university of montreal 14 women were dead nine women and four men

the sprawling university that rests on a hill overlooking the city 
i saw death close up and i shook said vanthona ouy 22 one 
of scores of horrified students who streamed out of the building 
after the carnage its our friends who have been killed

congressional investigators are turning up 
evidence of possibly widespread security problems at the energy 
departments nuclear weapons plants which already are under the 
gun for extensive safety and environmental flaws 
little has been documented of security lapses mainly because 
details about protection of plutonium and other nuclear materials 
are classified as a result of congressional inquiries however 
oncesecret information is trickling out 
some members of congress and private experts say the emerging 
evidence points to an unnerving vulnerability to diversion of 
bombgrade plutonium to terrorists 
the questions of diversion and the pathways of diversion are 
extremely numerous said milton hoenig scientific director of 
the nuclear control institute a private group that advocates 
measures to control the spread of nuclear weapons 
despite the governments devotion to secrecy in matters of 
nuclear weapon production it appears some federal nuclear 
facilities have run the risk in recent years of allowing the theft 
of enough plutonium to build a nuclear bomb 
government documents also suggest that some energy department 
officials have played down protection problems other officials 
complain that budget constraints have prevented the department from 
filling security posts with adequately trained people 
among security slips disclosed this week by a house 
investigations subcommittee 
argonne national laboratorywest near idaho falls idaho 
violated rules last year on controlling access to portable 
plutonium at a nuclear reactor site at the lab 
details of the incident are classified but a senior energy 
department official told a closed hearing of the house energy 
investigations subcommittee that the violation revealed a 
deficiency and vulnerability to diversion of bomb materials to 
terrorists 
portions of the hearing transcript were declassified earlier 
this week 
the official hilary j rauch manager of the regional energy 
department office that manages the idaho facility did not dispute 
a suggestion by rep gerry sikorski dminn that the incident 
meant people could be carting plutonium out of the place rauch 
stressed that the problem has since been corrected 
quantities of plutonium large enough to make a nuclear bomb 
were left unattended in rooms without alarms at lawrence livermore 
national laboratory in california last spring 
a previously secret inspection report on livermore also said 
large quantities of plutonium were often left between process 
steps with only one person or unattended during normal business 
hours department officials acknowledged to the house subcommittee 
that this was a serious lapse of security 
a senior department official brig gen paul f kavanaugh 
expressed concern in an internal memorandum last april at the 
frequency of marginal and unsatisfactory ratings of nuclear 
material security by federal inspectors of weapons plants 
if within the doe we cannot articulate and enforce effective 
security practices at our most sensitive facilities we will 
deserve the comments of our most vocal critics wrote kavanaugh 
who left the department shortly after sending his memo 
kavanaugh also drafted a toughworded message that he suggested 
be sent to managers of key weapons plants requiring immediate 
action to improve nuclear materials security a few weeks later a 
brief version of his proposed message was sent offering thanks for 
previous efforts but making scant mention of the problems 
the subcommittee is investigating why the draft kavanaugh 
message was watered down by his superiors 
security questions also have arisen at the oak ridge weapons 
complex in tennessee rep john dingell dmich expressed alarm 
that responsibility for granting security clearances was taken away 
from oak ridges security officials and given to the personnel 
office 
also a laboratory at oak ridge was unsure for more than a year 
starting in august 1988 whether a substantial amount of tritium 
a gas used to make nuclear warheads had been stolen from a 
loading facility the department said last week that it was 
confident that none had been lost but some members of congress say 
doubts remain about oak ridges ability to protect tritium supplies

president fw de klerk 
announced a major defense cutback today including a reduction from 
two years to one year of the mandatory period of initial military 
service for white men 
he said certain military units would be eliminated and 
facilities closed with details to be disclosed next year 
the announcement came two weeks after south africa completed the 
withdrawal of its troops from namibia where since 1966 they had 
fought a bush war against proindependence guerrillas 
a year ago south africa signed a treaty that cleared the way 
for namibias independence and also halted south african 
involvement in the civil war in angola namibias northern neighbor 
these diplomatic developments have prompted speculation that a 
major cut in military spending is imminent 
de klerk opening a new headquarters for the state arms 
manufacturing corporation indicated that conscripts already in the 
military would have their terms of service shortened 
he said details about this would be disclosed friday 
the president said it was possible that career military 
personnel and employees of armscor the weapons company might lose 
their jobs as part of the cutback he said efforts would be made to 
find new jobs for these people 
it was the second time in 10 days that the president had 
announced steps which reduce the scope of military operations and 
influence on nov 28 he scrapped a nationwide security network 
which critics had denounced as an unaccountable shadow government 
de klerks predecessor pw botha had been criticized for 
giving the security forces too large a role in policymaking botha 
quit in august after losing a power struggle with de klerk 
under the current conscription system all ablebodied white 
males in south african are required to serve two years of initial 
military duty and then are eligible for callup camps that could 
amount to two more years of service spread out over 20 or more 
years military service for blacks asians and people of mixedrace 
is voluntary 
in september 780 white men vowed not to perform military 
service the largest defiance ever of conscription laws 
draft resisters face prison terms of up to six years or 1 
times the amount of unfulfilled service three men currently are 
serving sixyear terms the youngest 19yearold charles bester 
completed a full year of his sentence on tuesday 
the government does not release information on the manpower of 
the armed forces however at any given time in recent years there 
have been as estimated 68000 conscripts on active duty and about 
325000 men in the reserves out of the roughly 24 million white 
males of all ages in south africa

former philippines president ferdinand marcos 
said in videotaped testimony that his government collected 
information on dissident activities in america 
marcos who died in hawaii sept 28 said in a video deposition 
he became fearful of antimarcos protests in the united states by 
1984 when massive black propaganda was mounted against his 
regime 
asked whether four philippine agencies including the military 
and the presidential security command would have been involved in 
collecting intelligence in the united states marcos replied 
among other things most probably yes 
shown in us district court on wednesday the videotape was 
made in hawaii in july 1986 five months after marcos was 
overthrown in a popular revolt 
the late marcos his widow imelda and others are being sued 
for 30 million by the families of silme domingo and gene viernes 
union reformers and antimarcos activists who were fatally shot in 
june 1981 in the seattle offices of the alaska cannery workers 
union 
the suit claims marcos government ordered the killings based on 
an intelligence network in the united states that monitored 
antimarcos activists including domingo and viernes 
local prosecutors contended the killings involved an internal 
union dispute three men were convicted of the murders in a 1981 
criminal trial 
philippine intelligence in the united states would have been the 
same as any other countrys marcos said in the video 
every embassy including the american embassy have reports 
of this nature of those who are against the government in either a 
benign way or a vicious way he said i never heard of any 
serious effort of infiltrating any antimarcos organizations in the 
united states 
shortly before their deaths viernes had carried money to the 
philippines and met with antimarcos labor union officials there 
and he and domingo supported a resolution at a labor convention in 
hawaii calling for an investigation of labor conditions in the 
philippines 
but marcos said he wasnt very concerned about opponents in the 
united states until years after the killings 
this fear probably reached what you would call an 
attention level about 84 not before that because of the massive 
black propaganda directed at me personally marcos said 
he said he doubted a us senate committee report of the late 
1970s that said philippine agents had operated in the united states 
since 1973 keeping track of marcos opponents 
thats a surprise to me marcos said 
among the documents taken out of the philippines after marcos 
overthrow was one that plaintiffs claim shows a slush fund 
account in san francisco that was used to funnel money to the 
united states for intelligence work 
plaintiffs claim one 15000 entry on that account was used to 
pay for the murders of domingo and viernes 
marcos was not asked about that document in the video shown 
wednesday but he said the philippines intelligence apparatus 
contained funds that are considered held at the discretion of 
some of the officers

new prime minister vp singh visited 
sikhisms holiest shrine today and told an estimated 20000 sikhs 
to help him stop the sectarian violence that has cost thousands of 
lives 
too much bloodshed has taken place in punjab singh told the 
sikhs gathered inside the sacred golden temple 
singhs visit to punjab was the first by a prime minister since 
indira gandhi traveled to amritsar in june 1984 when she ordered a 
bloody crackdown on sikh extremists 
four months later she was assassinated by two of her sikh 
guards 
singhs visit is part of his new governments initiative to 
solve the sikh separatist campaign 
more than 7500 people have died in the 8yearold campaign for 
the homeland that sikh extremists propose to carve out of punjab a 
rich farming state bordering pakistan 
singh a hindu traveled in an open jeep your love to me is 
my security he told the sikhs who lined up the 2mile route and 
cheered him he gave autographs to sikh children and shook hands 
my government will move fast to bring peace and prosperity in 
punjab singh 58 told the sikhs gathered in the 14th century 
golden temple 
i have not come here for any political or governmental 
purposes singh said i have come to perform prayer in the holy 
shrine so that peace and normalcy can be restored in the state once 
again 
the shrine was the scene of a fierce battle when it was attacked 
by indian troops to flush out sikh militants entrenched inside 
more than 1200 people mostly sikhs were killed in the 1984 army 
operation that precipitated the revenge slaying of mrs gandhi 
sikhs whose religion is rooted in both islam and hinduism 
comprise just 2 percent of indias 880 million people but have a 
slight majority in punjab sikh militants claim the government in 
the predominantly hindu nation discriminates against them socially 
and politically 
hindus make up 82 percent of the population 
sikh took office last month after elections that ended the 
tenure of rajiv gandhi mrs gandhis son and immediate successor 
the new government issued formal orders dec 2 to free top sikh 
leaders from jails including a new member of parliament who was 
accused of plotting the 1984 assassination of mrs gandhi 
simranjit singh mann a former police officer accused of 
conspiracy was released from jail after the government withdrew 
cases against him mann was elected to the lower house of 
parliament from punjab by an overwhelming majority in last months 
national elections 
other leaders released were gurcharan singh tohra chief of the 
sikh temple management committee and prakash singh badal a former 
chief minister of punjab 
mann 44 who has been jailed for the past five years on

begun serving a fouryear sentence for a federal bribery conviction 
thomas reed 61 a former alabama house member surrendered at 
1130 am wednesday to a minimumsecurity prison in pensacola fla 
donna stratman assistant superintendent at the 300inmate 
staufley field prison said reed was fingerprinted photographed 
and assigned a standard prison uniform 
she said the prison which has no fences is located on navy 
property and inmates have work assignments in the facility or on 
the navy base 
reed who in 1970 became one of the first two blacks to serve in 
the alabama legislature since reconstruction was ousted from his 
seat after he was convicted in september 1988 of accepting 10000 
as a bribe to help obtain an early release for a convicted 
murderer anthony chesser 
the parole board denied the parole after reeds involvement 
became known chesser was released earlier this year 
reed was reelected president of the alabama chapter of the 
national association for the advancement of colored people in

the 11th us circuit court of appeals in atlanta recently 
upheld the conviction but reeds attorneys plan to take the case 
to the supreme court 
his attorneys say reed who predicts he will be vindicated 
should get a new trial because a jury heard about his attempts to 
remove the confederate flag from the alabama capitol

the state house has passed a bill 
requiring parental consent for unmarried girls under age 18 to have 
an abortion in michigan 
the bill passed 6539 wednesday after the house rejected nearly 
50 amendments including one to require boys to wear condoms to 
prevent teenage pregnancy 
it now goes to the senate which has passed a similar measure 
and is expected to take action before lawmakers leave for the 
winter holidays next week 
that sets up a promised veto by gov james blanchard who has 
pledged to strike down any measure restricting abortion rights 
opponents of the bill say it is merely intended to make it more 
difficult for girls to get an abortion planned parenthood 
officials said at least 70 percent of pregnant minors in michigan 
already bring at least one parent to an abortion clinic with them 
this bill is meant to put the squeeze on teenagers with no 
regard to the horrible alternatives they may seek said rep 
maxine berman a democrat can any of you live with yourself if a 
woman resorts to a backalley abortion or to crack cocaine to 
induce abortion or to suicide i dont want any more young people 
to die 
under the legislation a pregnant girl could petition a probate 
court to have an abortion if she believes she cant tell a parent 
or if the parent refuses to let her have an abortion permission 
would be required from just one of the parents 
were talking about the very bedrock of our society 
family said democratic rep michael griffin the bills sponsor 
we recognize there are families in trouble thats why we put the 
judicial bypass in there 
william kandler spokesman for blanchard said the democratic 
governor wouldnt change his mind despite a poll by the detroit 
news that said 68 percent of state residents favor a parental 
consent requirement 
im hopeful the governor will think about parents and not his 
own personal beliefs said barbara listing president of right to 
life of michigan 
margy long spokeswoman for planned parenthood of michigan said 
she was encouraged by at least 40 signatures collected on the house 
floor asking the governor to veto the bill 
that is more than enough to sustain a veto in the 109member 
house although supporters of the bill say they have enough votes 
for an override in the senate 
meanwhile the state department of public health reported 
wednesday that the number of abortions in michigan during the third 
quarter of 1989 fell 23 percent from the same period last year 
the drop comes on the heels of similar declines reported 
beginning in late 1988 with the implementation of a ban on 
statefunded medicaid abortions for poor women 
the 8696 abortions between july 1 and sept 30 compared with 
11358 in the same months in 1988

communist partys legal lock on power it also presented a bold 
challenge to president mikhail s gorbachev who has said that 
demands for more autonomy in some of the 15 republics are 
endangering his economic reform program 
gorbachev also has been trying to crack down on the autonomy 
movements to reassure orthodox soviet communists who have been 
alarmed by challenges to the communist party at home and in several 
eastern bloc countries 
eduardas potashinskas a lithuanian activist who has been 
monitoring the supreme soviets legislative sessions said the vote 
today was 2431 with 39 abstentions a vote on the same proposal

the 6th article of the constitution of the lssr was abolished 
and changed into the new formula which declares a multiparty 
system the information department of the lithuanian political

parties and movements are within the legal framework of the 
lithuanian constitution 
article 6 which became part of the basic law of the soviet 
union with the brezhnev constitution of 1977 makes the communist 
party the leading and guiding force of soviet society 
eliminating it could help reduce the partys grip on on all spheres 
of life 
the lithuanian action only affects that republic and is likely 
to face a stiff challenge from moscow a similar proposal in the 
armenia republic failed wednesday when the legislature failed to 
draw a quorum 
the lithuanian party is moving toward a showdown with the 
kremlin over its plans to separate from the soviet communist party 
gorbachev has spoken out sharply against that the lithuanians have 
scheduled a dec 19 party congress to decide on the issue 
czechoslovakia east germany poland and hungary all recently 
dropped similar provisions in their constitutions granting special 
status to their communist parties to satisfy prodemocracy 
movements in their societies 
in moscow green photocopied cards have appeared in metro 
stations and main streets calling for a twohour general strike on 
monday to ask the congress of peoples deputies to rescind the same 
provision in the national constitution 
human rights activist andrei d sakharov and five fellow members 
of the soviet parliament signed the appeal 
sakharov and his fellow deputies are calling for the brief 
general strike from 10 am to noon on monday to pressure the 
national congress into voting to rescind article 6 and on draft 
laws on land property and business enterprises the congress 
starts its second semiannual session tuesday 
it is of great importance that article 6 of the constitution 
be abandoned sakharov was quoted as saying by the soviet news 
bulletin interfax published today we cannot afford to bob in the 
wake of changes that are taking place in eastern europe 
in czechoslovakia the parliamentary action was preceded by a 
similar symbolic strike czechoslovak strike organizers publicized 
their plan through massive demonstrations wall posters and direct 
organizing at factories 
sakharov was quoted by interfax as saying that dropping the 
provision from the soviet constitution is extremely important in 
checking the crisis of confidence in the country 
the supreme soviet a fulltime working legislature is supposed 
to hammer out new laws but its parent body the congress must 
approve any changes in the constitution the supreme soviet voted 
on a proposal in early november to place consideration of article 6 
on the congressional agenda but the proposal defeated by a narrow 
margin 
the congress is the centerpiece of president mikhail s 
gorbachevs political reforms its 2250 deputies were elected last 
march in the countrys first competitive elections in more than 70 
years

the national commission on aids says it 
submitted its first report to the white house eight months early 
because the crisis has become too urgent to wait 
we have heard what people were telling us that a crisis 
situation does exist said dr david rogers vice chairman of the 
commission that began its work in august 
the commission wednesday released the sixpage report it sent to 
president bush calling for a national voice to repair a health 
care system that is in danger of crumbling under the weight of a 
worsening aids epidemic 
the public health care system in this country is not working 
well and nowhere is that more evident than for people with aids 
and people infected with the hiv virus the cause of aids 
while aids is not the cause of the health care systems 
disarray it may well be the crisis that could pressure responsible 
national action to correct its serious shortfalls the report 
said 
among the problems it cites are lack of training support for 
primary care physicians to treat people with hiv infection and aids 
and low reimbursement rates that discourage physicians from 
treating medicaid patients with aids 
also many aids patients have no public or private health 
insurance which limits their access to lifeprolonging drugs the 
report said 
the commission was required to draft its first report by august 
1990 but commissioners told bush in a letter that testimony they 
heard during four days of hearings was so compelling we felt it 
is vital to write to you now 
dr louis sullivan who as secretary of the department of health 
and human services is a nonvoting member of the commission did 
not participate in writing the report and his press office was not 
aware of the document until asked about it by reporters 
james brown a spokesman for sullivan said the secretary has 
expressed concern about some of the same issues addressed by the 
report however brown took issue with the proposition contained in 
the report that national leadership is lacking 
there has been leadership from this department and there will 
continue to be brown said citing the departments work on aids 
education programs drug research at the national institutes of 
health and federal funds undermedicaid to treat people with aids 
but the commission said more needs to be done 
to date there is no national policy or plan and no national 
voice the report said 
whats needed the commission said is frank recognition that 
a crisis exists in many cities that will require extraordinary 
measures to overcome 
the panel recommended creation of a flexible patientoriented 
comprehensive system of care and possible creation of a network 
of regional centers to provide backup and consultation to primary 
care physicians treating aids patients 
it also called for creation of units to treat of hiv patients 
who are intravenous drug addicts aids is spreading rapidly through 
needle sharing among drug users who are passing it to their sexual 
partners and their children 
the advisory commission was created as the followon to a reagan 
administration panel chaired by retired adm james d watkins that 
called for a major escalation of federal efforts to prevent treat 
and cure aids and for enactment of legislation barring 
discrimination against victims of the disease 
federal health officials say 112241 people have been found with 
aids in the united states since june 1981 and 66493 of them have 
died 
more than 1 million americans are believed to be infected with 
hiv the commission said that over the next four years aids is 
likely to claim 200000 lives 
the report estimated that direct medical care for people with 
aids in 1991 will cost from 25 billion to 151 billion it notes 
the range is from less than 1 percent to about 3 percent of total 
health care spending in the nation 
we simply must be prepared to make these expenditures the 
report said

east germanys communist party published a 
new program today that calls for free elections as soon as possible 
and broad cooperation with the opposition in an effort to salvage 
its diminishing power 
the program was announced as representatives of the communists 
and opposition opened talks on the countrys future 
the communists held a monopoly on power in east germany for 40 
years but two months of political upheaval have resulted in the 
loss of its guaranteed leadership role 
on wednesday former party leader egon krenz stepped down from 
his last official post the presidency and was replaced by a 
noncommunist manfred gerlach for the first time in the countrys 
40year history gerlach will be president until parliament chooses 
a permanent replacement 
krenzs politburo and central committee resigned sunday and were 
replaced by a 25member panel of party reformers who drew up the 
new program to be discussed at an emergency party congress friday 
we support free and secret elections as early as possible at 
a time to be set jointly by all political forces said the party 
program which was published by the official adn news agency it 
did not suggest a date for elections 
the program proposed that all newly formed democratic 
political movements and forces work together until the elections 
that was a reference to opposition movements such as new forum that 
have sprung up in recent weeks 
the program also called for a new consitution and new penal and 
administrative codes 
the party newspaper neues deutschland has indicated that the 
communists traditional leadership hierarchy the politburo and 
central committee will be abolished at the congress several east 
german officials have said the communists plan to change the 
partys name to the socialist party as was done in hungary 
recently 
the 25member panel conceded the party is responsible for the 
deepest crisis in the history of the german democratic republic 
and accused a certain circle of party functionaries of taking 
part in criminal and unregulated actions according to adn 
only a radical break with the partys stalinist basic 
structures can create a new political home for those in our party 
who favor a free just and solidarityoriented society the panel 
said 
the talks today involved communist officials and representatives 
of the main opposition group new forum and four small political 
parties that had been communist allies but broke with the party in 
recent days 
about 300 demonstrators gathered outside the church where the 
talks were going on demanding the talks be broadened to include 
other groups 
a trade union representative complained that labor leaders had 
not been invited to the talks 
krenz took power oct 18 after hardline leader erich honecker 
was forced to resign amid rising calls for reforms krenz opened 
the countrys borders and promised sweeping reforms but his 
longtime association with the honecker government and growing 
pressure from the opposition and party ranks finally forced him out 
the upheaval set into motion investigations into abuses of power 
by the ousted communist elite whose members allegedly exploited 
their high position to rob public coffers and live lavish 
lifestyles 
honecker and others are under house arrest and criminal probes 
are under way three former politburo members including former 
economics czar guenter mittag have been arrested 
early today west berlin police spokesman helmut hinz announced 
that alexander schalckgolodkowski a former leading east german 
trade official was in a west berlin prison following an 
international manhunt schalckgolodkowski is accused of pocketing 
millions of dollars in illegal arms sales 
groups of demonstrators have been surrounding secret police 
stations in recent days to prevent former officials from spiriting 
away incriminating documents that may be used for investigations of 
former leaders 
on wednesday the government appealed for calm and restraint 
after reports of proreform activists seizing secret police 
facilities in the cities of leipzig and gera 
a recently formed citizens action group headquartered in east 
berlin claims numerous officials under probe by an official 
investigative committee have managed to destroy evidence that could 
be used against them 
adn reported late wednesday the suicide of an official who had 
been caught trying to leave a government building in east berlin on 
monday with two suitcases stuffed with state funds 
the news agency said the man was arrested after trying to remove 
funds stashed by schalckgolodkowski

two deputies have been charged with 
conspiring to delay the courtordered seizure of property from a 
financially troubled company after mayor w wilson goode called 
the sheriff on behalf of the companys owner 
the delay last january gave the businessman time to avoid the 
seizure by declaring bankruptcy 
goode says he did nothing wrong by referring the businessman to 
the sheriff and said the grand jury report describing the man as a 
friend of his was wrong 
the two deputies surrendered wednesday to face charges they 
conspired to delay the seizure of 160000 worth of machinery from 
elijah medleys business 
a grand jury presentment released wednesday said medley faced 
the seizure after defaulting on about 500000 in loans the grand 
jury also raised questions about the involvement of city officials 
in pennsylvania grand juries may issue a presentment 
recommending that a prosecutor charge someone instead of issuing 
an indictment bringing the charge itself 
we are concerned that city officials knowingly abused the 
power of their office to unfairly benefit one citizen at the 
expense of other citizens to impede the orderly administration of 
justice the presentment said 
we will continue our investigation to determine if there was a 
systemic abuse of power and to determine whether any other public 
officials were involved in such conduct 
the prosecutor is district attorney ronald castille a 
republican considered to be a mayoral prospect in 1991 
goode and sheriff john green both democrats denied any 
wrongdoing 
i did not intervene the mayor told reporters i simply 
referred a businessman who is not my friend to someone who could 
help him i can assure you that ron castille knows deep down in 
his soul that i did nothing wrong 
i dont do wrong things and i resent anyone implying that 
green also denied wrongdoing and said he was confident that 
chief deputy joseph graves jr 56 and lt robert armstrong 41 
would be exonerated of what he called weak charges that have 
obvious political implications 
the defendants are accused of purposely failing to execute a 
courtordered seizure of equipment from medley tool and model 
co castille said the seizure was supposed to have been made 
jan 30 but it was delayed and the company filed for bankruptcy 
feb 1 
charges against graves and armstrong include criminal conspiracy 
and tampering with public records or official information each a 
felony punishable by up to seven years in prison 
neither goode nor green denied the mayor had made a telephone 
call on behalf of medley shortly before the seizure was to have 
been made 
goode said medley called him the grand jury presentment 
described the businessman as the mayors friend which goode said 
was inaccurate and asked for help about a sheriffs sale 
problem for which he needed more time goode said he then called 
green at home 
the sheriff declined to discuss details of the case but said he 
felt it was political he also said parts of the presentment were 
inaccurate 
castille just elected to a second term said both the mayor and 
sheriff appeared to have played an integral part in the case 
the presentment said that after the writ was delayed sheriff 
green asked chief graves has the mayors job been taken care of 
and graves said that it had 
the mayor summoned reporters to his city hall office and denied 
he had done anything wrong insisting the phone call from a 
businessman was normal and that all he did was refer it to the 
sheriff 
medley couldnt be reached by telephone for reaction his 
company though in bankruptcy is still in business but telephone 
calls are taken by an answering service

president virgilio barco blamed a truck 
bombing that killed 52 people in the capital on drug traffickers 
and pledged not to allow colombian democracy to succumb to their 
bloody tyranny 
barco went on national television wednesday night after 1100 
pounds of dynamite were detonated in front of the offices of the 
secret police in bogota gouging out a 20footdeep crater and 
wounding hundreds of people 
it was one of the worst terrorist attacks in colombian history 
in the last few days the criminal organization of drug 
traffickers has begun a vile assault that has cost the lives of 
many innocent colombians barco told his countrymen 
three more bombs exploded in the cocainetrafficking center of 
medellin just before the speech was transmitted from tokyo where 
barco was on a state visit the bombs targeting a mormon temple 
an evangelical church and an electronics shop caused only slight 
damage and no injuries police said 
today a bomb exploded on a road in the northern coastal city of 
cartagena killing two policemen in a car radio reports said but 
pamphlets found at the scene suggested the attack was carried out 
by the national liberation army the most active of colombias six 
leftist guerrilla groups 
barco said the bombing at federal intelligence police 
headquarters was part of a string of attacks by drug gangs intended 
to force the government to stop extraditing to the united states 
traffickers indicted by us authorities 
he said traffickers also were responsible for the nov 27 
bombing of a colombian jetliner that killed all 107 people aboard 
as well as for tuesdays assassination of a medellin judge 
he said the countrys resolve to battle traffickers would not 
waver as a result of their terrorist onslaught 
they will not succeed in defeating us he said we are 
fighting and will continue to fight the war is against all 
colombia against democracy we will not allow ourselves to fall to 
the bloody tyranny of the narcoterrorists 
the extraditables a group linked to the powerful medellin 
cocaine cartel claimed responsibility for the truck bombing at 
intellegence police heaquarters the claim came in a written 
communique received tuesday by half a dozen newspapers and radio 
stations in medellin 
the morning rush hour explosion killed at least 52 people and 
wounded about 1000 aerial photographs showed extensive damage to 
buildings in a nearly two square mile area 
the explosion felt more than three miles away caused 23 
million worth of damage to about 1500 houses and buildings 
including nearby justice ministry offices 
the extraditables said in their message that they would continue 
the terrorist campaign until the senate approves a national 
referendum on the countrys extradition policy 
the barco administration has sent nine drug suspects to the 
united states since decreeing the policy in august when it 
declared allout war on traffickers after they were blamed for the 
assassination of a popular presidential candidate 
however none of the 12 leading cocaine bosses wanted for 
extradition to the united states have been caught 
on tuesday the house of representatives passed a bill that 
would allow the public to decide in a plebiscite whether the policy 
should continue 
the administration has vehemently opposed the bill maintaining 
it would lead to more terrorist violence as traffickers try to 
intimidate colombians into rejecting extradition 
today the head of the governing liberal party former president 
julio cesar turbay said he would resign if the colombian congress 
approves the bill allowing the referendum on extraditions turbay 
made the announcement in a statement published in bogota dailies 
in his speech barco said the latest terrorist attacks prove the 
predictions validity 
these incidents show what these criminals would do to make 
sure that the referendum results are in their favor barco said 
there is still no indication on which way the senate might vote 
on the referendum but the bombings of the intelligence police 
offices and the avianca airlines boeing 727 are likely to 
strengthen support for the administrations opposition the 
referendum 
i was for a dialogue with traffickers before the bombings 
but now no way said one man interviewed on the news program 
24 hours 
traffickers have since august been bombing public places 
including banks supermarkets and theaters in an effort to 
pressure the government into reversing its decision to extradite 
but most of the the 201 previous bombings had been at night and 
consequently caused relatively few civilian casualties the 
campaign had killed 29 people before the latest phase of 
indiscriminate slaughter began with the bomb aboard the jetliner 
the intelligence police chief gen miguel maza marquez said 
wednesdays truck bomb was an example of the worst type of crime 
maza was in the building at the time of the attack and he said that 
although he was the main target the bombing was aimed at all 
colombians 
it was an indiscriminate act against the country against 
everything he said in a radio interview late wednesday with the 
rcn network

an attorney for margaret mitchells heirs said he 
was pleased with a paris courts ruling that a french bestseller 
plagiarized the classic gone with the wind but said he plans 
to appeal for more damages 
the french court ruled wednesday that regine deforges must pay 
the mitchell estate 333000 in damages and interest because her 
bestsellr the blue bicycle illegally pirated the atlanta 
authors book the mitchell heirs had sought 833000 from ms 
deforges and her publisher 
we are exceedingly pleased with the findings of the court as 
to piracy said atlanta attorney hal clark a former law partner 
of miss mitchells late brother stephens mitchell and an executor 
of the gone with the wind estate 
we are somewhat disappointed in the award of damages 
however he added saying he plans to appeal 
stephens mitchells son joe accepted the news calmly 
it sounds all right we seem to have won the case he said 
franck spengler president of the company that published ms 
deforges book said he and the author also would appeal the 
novelist was in west germany and unavailable for comment he said 
we feel were innocent spengler said wednesday 
the books are both great novels but they are very different 
the blue bicycle is a historical novel smattered with 
psychology and emotion while gone with the wind is a 
psychological novel cloaked with history he said 
in a judgment issued by judge nicole antoine the court 
concluded the blue bicycle constituted an illicit 
reproduction of gone with the wind 
based on a comparative study of the two works it is clear 
that what regine deforges borrowed from margaret mitchells work 
and incorporated into the blue bicycle is perfectly identifiable 
and relates to the most important elements of ms mitchells 
novel the statement said 
the blue bicycle which has sold millions of copies since it 
was published in 1983 as the first part of a trilogy is set during 
the nazi occupation of france 
its heroine lea delmas is the beautiful headstrong daughter 
of a southern vintner like scarlett ohara the beautiful 
headstrong daughter of a southern planter she finds her carefree 
youth interrupted by the horrors of war 
like scarlett lea wants the one man she cannot have laurent 
dargilat has married the sweet fragile and morally upright 
camille a character similar to melanie wilkes wife of scarletts 
unrequited love ashley wilkes 
ms deforges frenchstyle rhett butler francois tavernier 
is a swarthy cigarsmoking rogue who miraculously turns up 
whenever lea needs him 
the case has been long and complicated because there are few 
precedents french law forbids plagiarism but it does allow 
pastiche a centuriesold literary form defined as a humorous 
takeoff or remake of a recognizable original text 
ms deforges repeatedly asserted that her novel was meant as a 
pastiche but the court rejected her argument saying the 
differences between the two works were undeniably secondary and 
inoperative given the extent of their similarities

former president reagan is trying to quash a 
subpoena for his notes and diaries by onetime national security 
adviser john poindexter saying it encroaches on the office of the 
presidency 
poindexter facing trial jan 22 contends that notes and 
diaries compiled by reagan will show the expresident authorized 
the activities for which poindexter has been accused of crimes 
in a court filing wednesday reagan said poindexters subpoena 
was a broadgauge discovery device masquerading as a trial 
subpoena and that it seeks a laundry list of documents on 67 
different subjects 
the subpoena raises constitutional concerns about the 
presidents prerogative to maintain a purely personal and private 
record of his thoughts and reflections said reagans lawyers 
nothing could be closer to the core of the presidency and more 
private than the intimate and confidential communications by the 
president with himself the lawyers argued 
reagan and the justice department suggested in separate filings 
that president bush might become involved in the battle over the 
records from reagans presidency 
reagan suggested a review of a limited number of diary excerpts 
by us district court judge harold greene who is handling the 
poindexter case 
only then should the former president and if appropriate the 
incumbent president be forced to assert or waive executive 
privilege reagan said in the court papers 
the justice department urged the court to consider bushs views 
before taking the extremely serious step of forcing public 
disclosure of reagans diaries 
the justice department proposed a procedure under which it would 
review a sealed filing that poindexter made to the court outlining 
what he believes are in the diaries and why he needs them 
the department noted that this procedure would not compromise 
the secrecy of poindexters defense because the office of 
independent counsel lawrence walsh not the justice department is 
prosecuting the case 
after reviewing poindexters filing the justice department said 
it would prepare a response the court could then inspect excerpts 
of the diaries the justice department said 
the department moved to quash a similar subpoena for reagan 
papers served by poindexter on the national archives and records 
administration the material sought from the archives has already 
been turned over to irancontra prosecutors the justice department 
said 
reagans lawyers said any diary entry must be found by the judge 
to be central to poindexters case and essential to justice 
before it can be disclosed 
earlier wednesday the judge rejected a request by poindexter to 
subpoena records from 65 us senators and representatives 
greene also denied as overly broad poindexters request to issue 
subpoenas to a number of congressional committees the office of 
white house counsel and the national security agency the judge did 
not disclose how many committees poindexter wanted to subpoena 
the judge said the only apparent basis for the proposed 
subpoenas to the members of congress is that they at one time or 
other met with oliver north 
north a former national security council staff member was 
involved in the secret contra resupply network and the 
administrations arms sales to iran he was convicted of three 
felonies in the irancontra affair and is appealing 
poindexter has said that reagan formulated or tacitly 
approved the administrations position on matters for which 
poindexter now faces trial 
he has said his communications with reagan included discussion 
of a white house chronology that falsely said no one in the us 
government knew at the time that a 1985 shipment to iran contained 
hawk missiles 
another subject poindexter says he discussed with reagan is the 
administrations view of a proposed house resolution of inquiry 
into norths secret contra resupply network poindexter is accused 
of obstructing congress by endorsing earlier denials that the 
national security council staff was soliciting funds or 
coordinating military efforts for the contras

iraq said today it launched a rocket 
capable of carrying satellites into space a development that would 
have profound implications for the military balance in the middle 
east 
hussein kamel minister of industry and military 
industrialization said on staterun baghdad radio that the 
threestage rocket was launched at 830 am tuesday from the 
alanbar space research center 
he also claimed that iraq has developed two other 
surfacetosurface missiles with a range of 1240 miles if true 
this would double the reach of iraqs missile arsenal 
the heaviest missile the iraqis are believed to have developed 
is the alhussain weapon with a range of around 560 miles 
there was no independent confirmation of the launch 
the report did not specify the missiles flight path or say 
where the research center is located kamel said the 48ton rocket 
will be used to launch a satellite for scientific research he said 
it used a 70ton firststage launch vehicle far bigger than 
anything the iraqis were believed to possess 
he said the launch was the first stage of an iraqi space 
research program 
oilrich iraq is the only arab country to have claimed it has 
the capability of launching satellites into space if true this 
could enable it to develop a military satellite to spy on israel 
and iraqs rivals in the region 
israel is the only middle east country known to have satellite 
capability 
president saddam hussein of iraq has been driving to develop an 
aerospace industry for some time and has spent billions of dollars 
on missile development 
the most ambitious part of the program was developing a 
multistage ballistic missile with egypt and argentina based on 
argentinas condor missile 
the radio report quoted kamel as telling saddam in a telegram 
announcing the launch that the rocket was built at iraqi 
militaryindustrial research centers but intelligence officials 
and diplomats have been skeptical for some time about such claims 
israel launched the ofek1 satellite sept 19 1988 from a 
military base south of tel aviv it said ofek1 was designed for 
scientific research but arab governments fear it will be used as a 
spy satellite 
israel has said it is working on an ofek2 satellite the soviet 
news agency tass reported that the israelis launched a ballistic 
missile sept 14 
israel denied it but western intelligence agencies believe the 
reported firing could have been an abortive effort to launch ofek2 
into orbit 
if the iraqis have acquired the potential to put a satellite 
into space the iranians and syrians would be concerned 
iran and iraq fought an eightyear war that was halted by a 
ceasefire last year but peace talks have deadlocked and both 
sides are rearming 
syria is saddams archrival in the arab world and was allied 
with iran against iraq during the war 
a spy satellite capability would greatly enhance saddams 
military might and would erode israels longheld technological 
superiority already threatened by the buildup of longrange 
surfacetosurface missiles by iraq iran syria and saudi arabia 
libya too is seeking a missile arsenal

after two years of protests strikes and 
bloodshed the palestinian uprising has lost its way failing to 
deliver a palestinian state or even negotiations with israel 
at the same time israeli prime minister yitzhak shamirs 
government which refuses to talk with yasser arafats palestine 
liberation organization is increasingly frustrated over its 
inability to restore calm either through diplomacy or force of arms 
divisions on both sides have blocked compromises that could have 
started negotiations 
unless peace efforts gain momentum the prospects are for even 
meaner streets with radical palestinians gaining influence and 
calling for the use of guns not words to solve the problem 
the toll from the intefadeh arabic for uprising is 
already fearful 
by associated press count 626 palestinians have been killed by 
israelis un figures show 39000 arabs wounded and 40000 jailed 
9000 of whom were denied a trial also 363 arab houses have been 
demolished or sealed and 60 activists deported 
on the other side 43 israelis have died and 2438 civilians and 
1635 soldiers were wounded in more than 60000 incidents of 
unrest israels economy suffered about 800 million in lost 
production and tourism as well as increased military costs 
including two months a year of reserve duty for most men 
despite the high cost palestinians have scored gains 
they succeeded in defining the territory in the west bank gaza 
strip and east jerusalem that they want for an independent state 
except for soldiers most israelis rarely venture into these areas 
now 
the underground proplo unified national leadership of the 
uprising has also demonstrated unity and determination with 
onceaweek general strikes and the closure of stores and 
businesses every afternoon 
but the strikes and rockthrowing have become routine almost 
mechanical gestures that despite the ongoing bloodshed no longer 
carry the political punch needed to arouse international concern 
and pressure on israel 
i believe over the last few months we have lost the 
initiative and there has been a vacuum of strategy we havent had 
any renewed strategic plan to put into the intefadeh said sari 
nusseibeh a leading palestinian intellectual 
nusseibeh a philosphy professor considered by israelis to be a 
senior proplo activist said palestinians should use positive 
energy to create a provisional government 
he proposed health education welfare and other organizations 
be united into areawide plorun institutions that could serve as 
the basis for ministries in a future government 
israels government launched an initiative to start the peace 
process with elections in the occupied lands to chose a palestinian 
delegation for talks but the cabinet is deeply divided and unable 
to deliver compromises to satisfy palestinian demands that the plo 
have a public role 
two prominent israeli intellectuals journalists ehud yaari and 
zeev shiff proposed that israel stage an administrative 
withdrawal from occupied lands as an interim step until elections 
can be arranged 
they suggested turning over some government functions to 
moderate palestinians who would be likely to win elections if they 
were held 
thus some of the burden of occupation would be removed and 
friction between the inhabitants and the israeli army will be 
reduced they wrote 
ephraim sneh a retired general who once headed the west bank 
military government told a seminar at hebrew university that the 
plo in seeking to influence international opinion had failed to 
persuade average israelis that it had really wanted peace 
sneh called for palestinians to shift focus and understand in 
the coming year that their real opportunity is not in gaining the 
sympathy of the world but the confidence of israelis 
israeli society is a traumatized society he said alluding 
to the jews experience with the nazi holocaust and repeated wars 
with the arabs 
it is difficult for the israelis to believe that after 22 
years the plo really abandoned terrorism he said 
in recent months there has been increasing concern about the 
rise of palestinian radicals who oppose negotiations and advocate 
armed struggle 
splits in palestinian ranks are already clear with small 
extremist groups taking over neighborhoods or towns and according 
to underground leaflets operating independently 
interpalestinian violence has increased palestinians have 
killed 154 of their fellow arabs most on suspicion of informing 
for israel 
groups calling themselves the black panthers and red eagles 
controlled the casbah quarter of the west banks largest city of 
nablus killing 25 suspected collaborators and shooting at israeli 
outposts 
the army claimed to have neutralized the two groups killing or 
capturing their leaders in recent weeks but there is ongoing 
concern such groups will proliferate as frustrations grow over a 
lack of progress toward peace talks 
hanna siniora editor of the arabic daily al fajr in jerusalem 
said peace prospects appeared bleak but that the palestinian 
leadership was trying to maintain its noguns policy 
palestinians are trying in every way to keep this a 
nonviolent resistance movement in order to positively affect 
israel public opinion he said calling for increased 
israelipalestinian dialogue

american medical association policymakers have 
recommended that communities set up systems to find and notify 
unsuspecting sexual or needlesharing partners of people infected 
with the aids virus 
the amas house of delegates on wednesday also broadened its 
attack on drug abuse to include tobaccorelated diseases 
the delegates approved the aids notification policy by voice 
vote as part of a resolution that encourages state legislatures to 
establish laws for reporting and following up on serious 
communicable diseases including aids 
the resolution says communities and prisons should have systems 
to notify people who are at risk of aids because they have sexual 
partners or share drug needles with infected people 
dr david johnson of arkansas said concern for patient privacy 
should be secondary in light of the number of aids deaths in the 
united states as of the end of october the federal health 
authorities had recorded 112241 cases of aids in the united 
states with 66493 deaths 
however former military physician j william cox of san diego 
protested saying devising a system to keep track of sexual or 
druguse partners would waste incredible amounts of money and 
drive people infected with the aids virus underground 
in other business the association resisted an attempt to remove 
tobacco from a resolution naming substance abuse its top health 
priority 
the resolution included the endorsement of a routine screening 
program for all pregnant women and those of childbearing age for 
evidence of substance abuse 
before ending its threeday meeting wednesday the ama delegates 
also ordered the restructuring of the groups internal organization 
and restricted the authority of its executive vice president 
that action came after ama executive vice president james h 
sammons approved two financial deals with executives that failed 
and caused thousands of dollars in losses 
sammons accepted full responsibility for the deals and a call 
for his immediate resignation failed with more than twothirds of 
the 435 delegates supporting him sammons is due to retire at the 
end of next year 
the organizations 280000 members account for about half the 
doctors in the united states

the governments massive cholesterol education 
program places too much emphasis on drug treatments that may do 
more harm than good a congressional panel was told today 
but a federal official defended the national cholesterol 
education program saying its guidelines will improve the health of 
americans and reduce the risk of heart attacks the nations 
leading killer 
thomas j moore an investigative reporter whose article in the 
september issue of the atlantic magazine inflamed the controversy 
over cholesterol monitoring said he questions the value of what he 
says is aggressive treatment recommended by the federal program 
this is a very serious and expensive mistake in public 
policy he told the house energy and commerce subcommittee on 
health 
the programs cholesterol guidelines recommend diet as the 
treatment of choice but says that failing that patients with high 
levels of cholesterol should seek treatment with drugs 
an estimated 60 million americans are believed to have high 
blood cholesterol a fatty substance that can clog arteries and 
contribute to heart disease and heart attacks 
besides cholesterol other factors that have been identified as 
factors in heart disease are high blood pressure obesity smoking 
and lack of exercise 
moore said he agrees with advice in the programs guidelines 
that americans should have their cholesterol levels checked and 
make their diets healthier by eating less fat fewer calories and 
more fiber 
he also said there is evidence that high cholesterol levels in 
middleaged men makes them more vulnerable to heart disease 
although he said the evidence of a link is much weaker for men over 
65 and women of all ages who have no history of heart disease 
but the central question is do we have effective medical 
treatment that justifies putting 60 million people under longterm 
care of their doctor moore said 
he said the evidence he has found shows that diet does little to 
lower cholesterol levels in the blood and that while drug 
treatments show more benefit they have not demonstrated 
significant ability to ward off fatal heart attacks 
moore said his complaint with the cholesterol program of the 
national heart lung and blood institute is that with evidence that 
diet isnt a significant factor in lowering cholesterol levels 
many who follow the programs guidelines will turn to drug 
treatments that can have side effects including liver damage 
cataracts and digestive difficulties 
when people become frustrated with diet there will be an 
expansion of drug treatment beyond what the architects of the 
program expected he said 
claude lenfant director of the heart lung and blood institute 
part of the national institutes of health disputed moore and said 
clinical trials have shown that lowering cholesterol levels by diet 
or drugs decreases the incidence of heart disease 
most people with high blood cholesterol will be able to lower 
their levels with diet alone and only a small minority will have 
to resort to drugs he said 
lenfant also noted that when the first surgeon generals report 
on smoking and health was released in the mid 1960s critics 
started talking about the tobacco myth 
it has taken a long time for the ripples to subside and for 
near unanimity to emerge that the risks of smoking are no myth 
he said 
much the same is true for cholesterol it may take a while 
before there is universal agreement about cholesterollowering but 
cholesterol is also no myth

communist premier ladislav adamec 
resigned today after failing to form a coalition government 
acceptable to opposition groups and he was replaced by the deputy 
premier 
adamec quit after meeting with leaders of allied noncommunist 
parties to discuss changes in the government according to bohuslav 
kucera head of one of those parties the socialists 
kucera said in an interview that adamec wanted a new person to 
head the next coalition government and to reach the compromises 
necessary to carry out reforms being sought by the tumultuous 
prodemocracy movement 
several hours later president gustav husak asked deputy premier 
marian calfa to replace adamec the state news agency ctk reported 
calfa who was promoted to the deputy premiership from minister 
without portfolio on sunday participated in most of adamecs talks 
with the opposition on forming a new government to resolve 
czechoslovakias political crisis 
calfa 43 studied at pragues charles university law faculty 
he had served as minister without portfolio since april 1988 it 
was not immediately known how his promotion would affect the talks 
with the opposition 
adamec had negotiated with opposition leaders in recent weeks 
and on sunday introduced a new 21member cabinet that included only 
five noncommunists and left communists in control of key 
ministries 
the opposition demanded more power for noncommunists and 
another new government by dec 10 
adamec threatened wednesday to resign if the opposition did not 
stop delivering him ultimatums 
his resignation leaves the 21member cabinet which was the 
subject of huge street protests in charge of the nation 
earlier today the opposition submitted adamec with a list of 
seven names for consideration in a new government 
the civic forum opposition movement and its slovak counterpart 
public against violence have threatened a nationwide general 
strike dec 11 if noncommunists are not given more power 
a general strike nov 27 was observed by millions and led to 
adamecs promise to create a new government with noncommunists 
the seven names given adamec were not released but opposition 
sources said leading slovak dissident jan carnogursky was on the 
list carnogursky was released from prison just 12 days ago after 
being held since august 
the struggle over the composition of the government comes after 
several weeks of whirlwind political changes 
in the weeks since a harsh police crackdown nov 17 on a 
peaceful demonstration in prague the energized prodemocracy 
movement has forced the communists to relinquish their 41year 
monopoly on power and to reverse 21 years of hardline policy on 
the failed prague spring reforms of 1968 
hardline leaders tied to the crackdown after 1968 have been 
sacked except husak whose resignation the opposition has demanded 
the opposition today denied it had intentionally put adamec 
under pressure to change the cabinet 
the crisis was caused by the current government not by us 
the opposition said in a statement we are not trying to force 
our demands through and we are not trying to force anybody to 
accept them in a hurry or under pressure 
in addition to adamec communist party leader karel urbanek and 
several other members of the ruling politburo were at todays 
meeting 
the shape of the new cabinet was expected to hinge on the 
outcome of the negotiations and on resolution of internal debates 
within the opposition and other groups 
adamec said in his wednesday television address that it was 
difficult to get professionals the opposition wants in the 
government to join such a cabinet the public mood changes from 
day to day and hour to hour he said 
he said he would have no choice but to quit if the new cabinet 
failed towin public confidence and the leadership crisis were not 
resolved 
the announcement was an obvious appeal to citizens to trust him 
to lead reforms that have ended the communists guaranteed monopoly 
on power in hungary poland czechoslovakia and east germany

leftist guerrillas renewed 
their assault on the salvadoran capital today setting up positions 
in at least seven neighborhoods and battling government soldiers 
the rebels claimed they shot down a military helicopter but the 
government said it suffered a mechanical problem and crashed 
a statement by the armed forces press office said columns of 
rebels infiltrated the metropolitan area from the north east and 
west during the night including the upperclass escalon and san 
benito districts 
there were no immediate reports of casualties a military 
spokesman said speaking on condition of anonymity for security 
reasons 
planes and helicopter gunships flew over the city during the 
night dropping flares and strafing suspected rebel positions 
while troops on the ground opened up with automatic weapons fire 
but the new outbreak was much smaller than the fighting that 
began when guerrillas launched an urban offensive on nov 11 as 
part of their decadeold struggle for power against a succession of 
usbacked governments 
fighting had subsided to a few scarce shots since friday after 
the rebels withdrew from an incursion in escalon and san benito 
also reported under attack were the workingclass neighborhoods 
of aytuxtepeque san ramon and soyapango north and east of the 
city and the small town of apopa to the north the military said 
the military spokesman said a usmade helicopter crashed 
during the night because of mechanical failure but the rebels 
clandestine radio venceremos claimed it was shot down by guerrilla 
fire 
in the broadcast the guerrillas of the farabundo marti national 
liberation front also announced they were renewing their sabotage 
campaign against electric power installations and other economic 
targets 
rebel groups destroyed two city buses and five private 
automobiles were destroyed by guerrillas in santa ana 25 miles 
west of the capital and a burlap bag factory in san miguel 85 
miles east of san salvador 
the rebels also were reported to have dynamited a bridge on the 
litoral highway near the city of usulutan 70 miles east of the 
capital 
in an unrelated development the government allowed three us 
episcopalian bishops to enter the country to check on several 
episcopalians who were imprisoned during the recent offensive by 
leftist guerrillas 
bishops william frey of the diocese of colorado david reed of 
kentucky and william swing of california arrived wednesday on a 
commercial flight from miami and went through immigration 
proceedings with no problems 
the first two had come on tuesday and were told by immigration 
authorities their visas were invalid they were put on a flight 
back to miami where they spent the night before making the second 
attempt to enter 
frey said president alfredo cristiani sent a letter by telefax 
apologizing for the previous days problems

communist party members involved in prostitution 
will be expelled from the party according to new regulations 
announced thursday 
the partys central commission for discipline inspection said 
any party member who sells sexual favors patronizes a prostitute 
or forces or instigates others to do so will lose his or her party 
membership 
the official xinhua news agency said the rules also stipulate 
that any member who harbors a prostitute shields related actions 
or obstructs the investigation or punishment of a prostitution case 
will receive punishment more severe than removal from party posts 
prostitution is one of the six evils that have become the 
target of a nationwide anticrime campaign the others are 
gambling drugs the selling of women and children pornography and 
superstition 
the evils have been linked to the western tendencies the 
current hardline leadership has sought to eradicate since 
suppressing the prodemocracy movement in the spring 
prostitution is believed to be most prevalent in canton and 
other freewheeling southern china cities and in other cities such 
as shanghai where contacts with foreigners are on the increase

china said thursday the cold war will continue as 
long as a few countries apparently the united states and the 
soviet union continue to try to influence events in other 
countries 
the practice of power politics will eventually jeopardize the 
relaxation of the international situation and only lead to a 
continued cold war foreign ministry spokesman jin guihua said at 
a weekly news briefing 
jin was responding to a question on whether the malta summit 
between president bush and soviet president mikhail s gorbachev 
signaled an end to the cold war 
the international situation is undergoing major changes at 
present jin said hegemonism is finding its going tougher and 
tougher however power politics hasnt entirely resigned itself 
from the historical arena 
he added in the international relations its still easy to see 
attempts made to interfere in others internal affairs by means of 
one sort or another violating the norms governing international 
relations 
the chinese governments only previous comment on the summit was 
that it hoped the results will genuinely help relax and stabilize 
the world situation and will not harm the interests of any third 
party 
asked which superpower was more responsible for prolonging the 
cold war jin said only in this world of today there are very 
few countries that are in a position to practice power politics we 
are against whomever practices power politics 
through much of the 1970s and 1980s china claimed that soviet 
hegemonism was the biggest threat to world peace however 
moscow and beijing this year normalized relations after three 
decades of animosity while beijings relations with washington 
have plummeted following the military crackdown of the 
prodemocracy movement this spring 
china repeatedly has accused the united states of power 
politics for imposing economic sanctions on china to protest the 
chinese governments harsh suppression of dissent 
jin on thursday again blasted the united states for taking 
measures to make it easier for chinese students worried about 
persecution at home to extend their stays in the united states 
the sending of chinese personnel to study abroad their 
management and assignment upon their return are all chinas 
internal affairs in which no foreign government or parliament has 
the right to interfere jin said 
the us action is bound to do serious damage to the sinous 
educational exchanges and the responsibility for it lies with the 
us side 
jin said china had taken note of bushs veto of a 
congressional bill on the visa status of chinese students but 
expressed regret that bush had taken administrative actions similar 
to those called for in the bill and said allegations that chinese 
students face persecution upon their return are utterly 
groundless

president bush likening the us war against 
drugs to peoples quest for freedom in eastern europe today lauded 
a poor black community that united to drive drug dealers out of a 
public park 
as with the new freedom in eastern europe freedom from drugs 
isnt something the government can give you bush said in remarks 
prepared for an antidrug rally at winzer park in his adopted 
hometown 
youve got to take a stand youve got to take back the 
streets he urged 
he lauded the tenants and community activists from the acres 
homes war on drugs committee who helped sweep drug dealers out of 
winzer park last year and organized neighborhood crimewatches to 
keep them out 
he said that like those demanding freedom to travel and vote in 
eastern europe the acres homes residents have used people 
power to fight for another kind of freedom freedom from fear 
freedom from crime freedom from drugs 
bush said acres home was once the embodiment of the american 
dream the largest unincorporated black community in the south 
but in recent years the dream on main street has become the 
nightmare on elm street a twisted backwards world where our 
children and our playgrounds are taken away by an evil menace 
called cocaine often in broad daylight he said 
by 1987 25 to 30 drug dealers were operating in winzer park 
and a circular drive was so clogged with cars of drugbuyers that 
police called it crackinthebox bush said 
but since 1000 community activists joined with police to drive 
the dealers out on april 9 1988 they havent come back and 
they better not he said the local residents had taken a stand 
against evil 
efforts like yours are a critical part of americas 
battleplan against drugs said bush who unveiled his 8 billion 
strategy three months ago he said parents teachers and other 
community leaders must teach children right from wrong and instill 
a sense of personal accountability 
only you can cultivate character and a sense of value in our 
kids it is not a federal problem for which there is a simple 
federal solution he said we cant do it by looking to the 
government alone 
he named the acres home war on drugs group as a recipient of one 
of his presidential points of light a daily honor highlighting 
outstanding volunteers 
bush was attending a fundraiser dinner in the astrodome tonight 
for sen phil gramm rtexas before journeying to colorado and 
iowa on friday 
he will spend the night in houston his adoptive home before 
heading to denver for another antidrug rally and a campaign 
luncheon for rep hank brown rcolo a us senate candidate 
bushs national drug policy coordinator william bennett also 
visited winzer park recently 
on friday bush will take part in an antidrug rally with 
members of the denver broncos football team then fly to des moines 
to address a fundraising dinner for rep tom tauke riowa tauke 
plans to run for the senate seat of democratic sen tom harkin 
bushs trip on behalf of domestic antidrug efforts comes a day 
after more violence rocked the drugproducing nation of colombia a 
truck bomb exploded outside police headquarters in bogota killing 
dozens and wounding hundreds during morning rush hour 
white house press secretary marlin fitzwater said colombia is 
still being considered as a site for the february drug summit that 
bush will attend with the leaders of peru colombia and bolivia 
the chief drugproducing nations 
however he said other sites outside of colombia are also being 
considered 
wherever we hold it we will do so with the assurance that we 
can provide security for the president he told reporters 
speaking about another latin american trouble spot fitzwater 
said the nicaraguan contra rebels had no alternative but to 
stay intact as a fighting force despite a regional peace accord 
requiring them to disband dec 5 
fitzwater contended that nicaraguas ruling sandinista 
government has not lived up to its commitments under the august 
agreement to promote democratic reforms and encourage repatriation 
of the contras

the bush administration is voicing deep 
skepticism about mikhail s gorbachevs efforts to repair the 
soviet unions ailing economy saying his ideas are simplistic and 
just far from the real world 
the gloomy assessment arises from gorbachevs weekend talks with 
president bush during a twoday summit off the mediterranean island 
of malta 
a senior administration official intimately acquainted with the 
two leaders discussions said gorbachev demonstrated he has less 
than a realistic economic notion of how to deal with his economic 
problems 
referring to gorbachevs ideas the official said theyre 
simplistic 
the official discussed the summit with a small group of 
reporters at the white house under assurances of remaining 
anonymous 
white house spokesman marlin fitzwater speaking with reporters 
today aboard air force one as bush flew to houston said we 
wouldnt use that word 
fitzwater said that the soviets do have a lack of knowledge 
about how free enterprise systems work and how market economies 
work and that was reflected in the conversation between bush and 
gorbachev at malta 
he said simplistic was not a very good word to use but 
there is going to be a problem in introducing free market economies 
to these marxist countries 
the soviet union is suffering from widespread shortages of food 
fuel and consumer goods despite gorbachevs program of economic 
reform known as perestroika 
the problems are expected to worsen during the bitter soviet 
winter raising fears of civil unrest 
a lot of his economic definitions and ideas and so on come out 
of a kind of marxist mold and theyre just far from the real 
world the official said 
in particular the official mentioned gorbachevs views on 
converting the ruble to a hard currency his lack of information 
about the benefits of a central bank comparable to the us federal 
reserve and his ideas about longterm leasing of land and factories 
to soviet farmers and workers 
the other side of it was here is a man of great 
selfconfidence the official said there was no hint of 
selfdoubt given the immensity of the problems he faces which he 
acknowledges but he was very very selfassured 
bush and gorbachev held eight hours of talks in their first 
superpower summit 
the official said gorbachev was more selfcontrolled than in 
his five earlier summit meetings with president reagan 
clearly he wanted to establish a relationship with the 
president and wanted this to be good the official said 
during the summit bush offered an array of economic concessions 
to help gorbachev deal with his economic problems 
the president proposed completion of a ussoviet trade 
agreement by june 1990 granting most favored nation status to 
moscow giving it the lowest possible tariffs for its exports 
the most favored nation status would be linked with the waiver 
of a 1974 law that imposed trade sanctions against moscow in 
retaliation for restrictions on emigration by soviet jews 
bush also proposed giving moscow observer status at a world 
organization that sets international trading rules the general 
agreement on tariffs and trade until now the united states had 
strongly opposed soviet participation 
i think he needs a lot more sophistiction the official said 
about gorbachev one of the things that will help him get the 
sophistication is something like observer status at gatt so he can 
have a look at how the world economy really works 
im not sure where he wants to go with economic reforms the 
official added 
while welcoming bushs economic package gorbachev was not at 
all in a posture of saying we want your help the official 
said 
what they dont want is the notion that the united states is 
going to come in to bail them out were not going to do it 
anyway 
on another subject the official said gorbachev suggested some 
flexibility toward ethnic unrest in the baltic states 
the official said the soviet leader said he was prepared to 
look on all kinds of autonomy but that he would draw the line 
at independence the official quoted gorbachev as saying we 
need to look for new structures to meet new circumstances 
the official added he seemed quite open to experimentation

a banner on the outskirts says 
with soviet union forever but the people of this bohemian 
village want to sell their 20foot statue of josef stalin for 
western currency 
everyone in town is with the revolution against the communists 
except one guy and hes in the secret police said butcher 
vaclav jicha 
well maybe 10 percent of komarov opposes these changes but 
all of the rest are happy said elementary school teacher jiri 
beran 
whatever the numbers a glance outside prague shows that the 
students november revolution is firmly implanted in smaller cities 
and rural areas 
in plzen an industrial city 50 miles west of prague 
anticommunist posters are less evident than in the capital but 
attitudes are clear during last weeks strike even the fabled 
urquell pilsener beer stopped flowing 
no one hesitated when we asked them to stop said jan 
kylbergr strike organizer at prazdroj brewery workers left even 
before he got a chance to read his manifesto 
we wont have to disband communist groups here added 
kylbergr 27 theyll destroy themselves 
if any place in czechoslovakia exemplifies the new mood it is 
komarov a village of 2200 people about 30 miles southwest of 
prague 
komarov makes machine parts no one likes to be more specific 
and the factory put up an immense stone statue of stalin in the 
1950s its still there on the square one of the last stalin 
monuments left in europe 
reformers were about to smash it into gravel when a visiting 
professor mentioned someone in britain collected stalin 
memorabilia komarov townsfolk in need of an oldage home figured 
stalin might be of some use to them after all 
that was a few days ago the plan in its earliest stages has 
not yet reached the proper channels for approval 
at first glance komarov looks like a party town walls are 
festooned with red stars the odd hammer and sickle and 
standardissue marxistleninist poster art 
a bulletin board announced a party youth march and there was 
stalins statue identifying him as the greater teacher of 
working people liberator of our country 
asked about it beran advised dont pay any attention to that 
garbage look over there he pointed to glass double doors to the 
little shopping mall plastered with leaflets from the opposition 
civic forum 
inside in a wellstocked store offering everything from bidets 
to bicycles saleswoman iva bartipanova explained how the pamphlets 
got there 
we didnt know anything about what was happening in prague 
until these things appeared on the doors she said during the 
night someone ripped them off but then they appeared again 
when demonstrations began in prague volunteer taxi drivers took 
students and actors from town to town to spread the word they 
found willing ears in komarov 
anyone who lived through the 1968 invasion must support what 
the civic forum is doing mrs bartipanova said in 1968 she was 
just bringing her infant son home from the hospital when she ran 
into soviet troops headquartered just up the road 
down a country road from komarov josef prochazka 65 lives 
alone on isolated farm the state decided to return to him last year 
after keeping it for four decades he knows all about the uprising 
prochazka could hardly believe it back in the 1950s he watched 
the communist militia shoot two men who mocked the idea of 
collective farms he spent years in a forced labor camp because his 
father would not join a collective he suffered later when a nephew 
defected 
now he makes a meager living sawing logs in the farms small 
mill which the state still owns 
despite it all he has swung right back into political 
kibitzing in czechoslovakias democratic tradition 
the opposition is doing the wrong thing he said we need 
two strong parties the peoples party and the socialists 
in sharp contrast to the immediate past almost everyone was 
happy to talk mothers pushing babies in prams carefully spelled 
out their names young soldiers described their enthusiasm and 
their officers misgivings 
for frantisek sojka a 85yearold pensioner in a motheaten fur 
hat the biggest surprise of the revolution was seeing an american 
reporter and english photographer wandering around loose 
sojka would just as soon keep the stalin statue it is art he 
says but he wants to see it accompanied by a monument to tomas 
masaryk czechoslovakias first president

the battleship uss iowa its no 2 turret 
still sealed after an april explosion that killed 47 sailors 
arrived today to cheers from the crews family and friends after a 
sixmonth deployment in the mediterranean 
the crew lined the rail bundled in pea coats to protect against 
cold blustery winds as the iowa docked at its home port shortly 
after 1 pm 
a cheer went up from more than 1000 family members and friends 
when the ship appeared on the horizon then they waited patiently 
for it to dock 
navy officials kept reporters about 500 yards away from the 
crowd during normal homecomings the crew families and media 
representatives are free to mix after the ship ties up 
were doing this to protect the privacy of the crewmen and 
their families said lt cmdr steve burnett a navy spokesman 
adm jd williams the 6th fleet commander in the 
mediterranean laid the groundwork for a festive welcome by telling 
crew families in a letter pull out all the stops for the iowas 
homecoming 
in contrast the iowas return to norfolk naval base four days 
after the april 19 gun turret explosion was somber and silent 
then the 1500 crewmen in their white uniforms lined the 
battleships rails each crewman wore a black armband as tugs 
nudged the 887foot warship was nudged toward the pier the several 
thousand people on shore stood silent 
the navys controversial report on the explosion was released in 
september while the iowa was at sea it found the blast most likely 
was caused by a disgruntled gunners mate who sabotaged the huge 
gun and died in the explosion 
that report is being challenged by many of the families of the 
47 victims who believe the navy is covering up equipment and 
training failures aboard the world war iiera battleship 
congressional committees will hear testimony next week from navy 
officials and fbi experts navy investigators found that sabotage 
was the only explanation for the explosion but the fbi has 
declined to endorse that conclusion because its tests and 
investigation failed to duplicate the navys findings

congressional leaders expressed concern today 
about the depth of opposition to philippine president corazon 
aquino despite her apparent success in quelling the latest coup 
against her government 
it appears that the immediate threat to mrs aquinos 
government has been removed but its troubling that some of the 
rebel military elements are among the most professional and 
proficient philippine military house speaker thomas s foley 
told reporters outside the white house after a meeting with 
president bush 
sen patrick leahy dvt said the coup raises concerns about 
us aid for the philippines especially as the two nations enter 
negotiations for the future of the major us bases there 
were obviously concerned about what that moneys going to be 
spent on what the governments going to be there said leahy 
sen alan simpson rwyo said this was the best organized coup 
to date our intelligence shows us if they keep stepping it up 
grade by grade she will be in deep trouble he said 
simpson noted that congress has been considering aid of up to 
16 billion including benefits for philippine war veterans as 
part of the price of renewing base leases 
a senior adminstration official said wedneday that despite 
putting down the coup mrs aquinos political future appears 
uncertain 
shes been hurt theres no question about it said the 
official adding that mrs aquino should take seriously what 
happened 
asked about those comments today white house spokesman marlin 
fitzwater said on the record we would not speculate on mrs 
aquinos future he acknowledged that the united states has 
concerns about the situation and certain philippine policies but 
that does not diminish the fact that we support her and her 
government and we hope that theyre successful 
at the state department spokesman richard boucher said mrs 
aquinos government has shown incredible resilience in this 
situation and he restated our very strong support for her 
setting a more optimistic tone than the senior official boucher 
said pessimism surrounded a coup attempt in 1987 but that the 
phillipines rebounded rapidly and continued its economic growth 
the united states now expects that the philippine people can 
pull together under president aquinos leadership to achieve a 
similar recovery from the latest unrest he said 
the official briefing a small group of reporters wednesday on 
the condition that he not be identified further apparently was 
seeking to send a clear message to mrs aquinos usbacked 
government to become more responsive to criticism within her 
country 
mrs aquinos future may depend on her ability to eliminate 
the sources of discontent the official said 
uneasiness among the philippine population in general and 
within the military in particular is a sure sign of trouble and 
as a political leader she has to deal with it the official said 
asked if mrs aquino could survive politically the official 
said thats a tough one 
he spoke as the coup attempt the sixth since she took office 
in 1986 seemed to be running out of steam rebel forces who had 
fortified themselves in manilas makati business district returned 
voluntarily to their barracks thursday 
however it remained unclear whether the announcement marked the 
end of the coup 
at least 79 people have been killed and more than 570 wounded 
since friday 
earlier us officials praised as careful and effective a 
philippine evacuation that freed 280 americans and other foreign 
citizens from the manila hotels where they had been trapped by 
gunfire in the 7dayold rebellion 
we commend the aquino government for organizing and carrying 
out this operation said state department spokeswoman margaret 
tutwiler applauding the careful and effective manner in which it 
dealt with the situation in the makati commercial district and the 
efforts it took to safeguard american citizens and others who were 
in the area 
the senior administration official said that with us military 
help mrs aquino had appeared to survive an almostsuccessful 
coup correcting himself to say a serious attempted coup 
in any event he said i think that if she takes seriously 
what happened and tries to eliminate the sources of discontent 
which helped lead to the coup it may come out all right for her 
we really have to reassess what all this means 
asked to elaborate he said we have to assess what this has 
done and the american assistance in terms of the situation people 
will use the fact that she called on america against her 
president bush heeded mrs aquinos plea for help last friday 
sending f4 fighter jets from clark air base screaming over two air 
fields held by rebels preventing the insurgents from using those 
fields to launch additional attacks 
the united states gave 650 million to the aquino government 
this year the third largest foreign aid package behind only 
israel and egypt the united states maintains two bases in the 
philippines clark and the sprawling subic bay naval base 
us leases on both bases expire in 1991 and the attempted coup 
seriously complicates efforts to renegotiate those leases for the 
time being lease talks have been put on hold

entertainer wayne newton has asked a 
federal appeals court to uphold the record 53 million damage 
award in his suit against nbc news over reports that he was linked 
to organized crime figures 
newtons attorney has filed a 120page brief with the 9th us 
circuit court of appeals in san francisco saying that overturning 
the award would have dire consequences to the public 
lawyer morton galane said in the brief filed nov 17 that if the 
verdict is overturned victims of malicious defamation by the 
mass media will have no effective remedy and the media will not be 
deterred from disseminating knowing or reckless falsehoods 
the cost of litigating against a media giant like nbc will 
often exceed any compensatory award the victim could hope to 
receive 
if upheld newtons award would be the largest on record arising 
from a news report 
newton sued the network in 1981 claiming that a series of 
broadcasts in 1980 defamed him the broadcasts entitled wayne 
newton and the law linked newton to alleged crime figures and 
centered on his purchase of the aladdin hotel here 
the series was presented by nbc reporter brian ross and producer 
ira silverman 
a jury awarded newton 192 million in damages in 1986 
the following year us district judge myron crocker cut the 
award to 53 million 5 million of that is punitive damages 
but upheld the jurys libel findings 
nbc appealed to the 9th circuit after newton announced he would 
accept the reduced award

to limit movement by about 1 million people in the west bank to 
block protests linked to fridays anniversary 
in the west bank reinforced army units patrolled ramallah and 
bethlehem and police increased patrols in arab east jerusalem in 
gaza soldiers announced through loudspeakers that the seaside 
strip was under curfew 
plobacked uprising leaders ordered a threeday work stoppage 
starting thursday throughout the occupied lands to mark the 
anniversary of the intefadeh arabic for uprising in 
addition to a general strike saturday 
palestinian protests were subdued by rain thursday but police 
detained three people in a stonethrowing protest near jerusalems 
old city and four protesters were reported shot and wounded in the

proposed to hold elections he said 
under israels plan adopted in may palestinians would be 
elected to negotiate with israel on a period of interim selfrule 
for the occupied lands 
the palestine liberation organization has criticized the 
proposal since it is designed to bypass the plo and fails to 
guarantee eventual palestinian independence the main aim of the 
uprising 
israel views the plo as a terrorist organization and accepted 
the baker plan on condition the group would be excluded from the 
peace process 
israeli officials said shamir and foreign minister moshe arens 
worked out a positive stand to bakers plan after receiving 
us assurances that egypts reply was its own and not that of the 
plo 
the us made it clear to egypt that it could not accept that 
egypt would act as a postman for the plo and egypt made it very 
clear that it is not acting as such and would not do so a senior 
israeli diplomat said 
shamirs coalition partners in the leftleaning labor party 
praised egypts reply and vice premier and labor leader shimon 
peres declared if its positive its enough

the communist party suffered a major defeat in the 
soviet union on thursday when the republic of lithuania abolished 
the constitutional guarantee of communist supremacy and legalized a 
multiparty system 
similar action has been taken in poland czechoslovakia hungary 
and east germany as part of the wave of political upheaval and 
reform that is diminishing the role of the communist part in those 
nations 
lithuanias parliament defied moscow with a resounding 2431 
vote to end the partys total dominance of all political and social 
organizations within the baltic republic another 98 deputies 
abstained or stayed away from the session 
president mikhail s gorbachev has resolutely opposed a 
multiparty system for the soviet union the challenge to the 
communist power structure comes at a time when he faces a crippled 
economy growing nationalism and demands from conservative 
communists for more order 
the move in lithuania one of 15 soviet republics thrilled 
other soviet activists who are organizing a twohour general strike 
monday to call for similar action by the national parliament 
wonderfully done said activist yelena bonner on hearing of 
the lithuanian action you cannot restrain the movement today 
this is a good example for the other republics said bonner wife 
of nobel peace prize winner andrei sakharov one of a group of 
national parliamentarians calling for the general strike 
estonias parliament voted wednesday to delay voting on a 
similar switch to a multiparty system until next week to allow 
time for public discussion armenias parliament was forced into a 
postponement wednesday for lack of a quorum 
the lithuanian action rescinds article 6 of the republics 
constitution which says the communist party of the soviet union is 
the leading and guiding force of soviet society the nucleus of 
its political system government and social organizations 
according to tass 
in practice it meant that communists dominated every sphere of 
life and every organization in the country until gorbachevs 
reforms began to loosen the iron custom ambitious soviets were 
forced to join the party and follow its orders to rise in any 
profession 
similar articles are found in the national constitution of the 
soviet union and those of the other 14 republics 
word of the call for a general strike to demand a parliamentary 
vote on the national version of article 6 began to percolate 
through soviet society thursday after it was reported by western 
radio stations 
on thursday the newspaper izvestia published the first mention 
of the strike call in a generally circulated soviet publication 
the article was highly critical of the strike call but nevertheless 
spread the word to the newspapers 95 million readers nationwide 
it accompanied a letter from parliamentarian yuri chernichenko 
saying he supported the call for a vote on the communist partys 
supremacy but not the plan for a strike chernichenkos name was 
among the supporters listed on announcements of the strike 
sakharov and his fellow deputies called the strike to pressure 
the national congress of peoples deputies into voting to rescind 
article 6 and on draft laws on land property and business 
enterprises the congress starts its second semiannual session 
tuesday 
in latvia the peoples front is scheduled to meet with factory 
and labor leaders to respond to the call for a general strike 
janis krumins deputy editor of the latvian peoples front 
newspaper atmoda said the latvians are likely to strongly support 
the strike but for just 15 minutes not two hours 
eduardas potashinskas an activist who watched a live tv feed of 
the parliamentary session in the capital of vilnius said the 
supreme soviet directed that a new law governing the actions of 
political parties in the republic be prepared in the next 45 days 
potashinkas said lithuanian party first secretary algirdas 
brazauskas and other party leaders voted for the change he said 
that in debate tuesday brazauskas had termed the decision 
difficult but correct 
a first try tuesday fell nine votes short of the twothirds 
majority of 228 necessary for approval of a constitutional 
amendment because so many members were absent or abstaining 
the lithuanian communist party is due for a showdown with the 
kremlin on dec 19 when its party congress is to vote on a plan to 
separate from the communist party of the soviet union and on a 
program that includes support for lithuanian independence 
gorbachev has spoken out sharply against both moves but lithuanian 
communist leaders say they must change or face certain defeat in 
upcoming elections

prime minister vp singh visited 
sikhisms holiest shrine the golden temple on thursday in a major 
initiative by his government to end the lingering secessionist 
campaign by sikh militants 
it was the first visit by a prime minister to the golden temple 
in more than five years since shortly after a bloody army raid 
that led to the assassination of prime minister indira gandhi 
too much bloodshed has taken place the hindu prime minister 
told about 20000 sikhs inside the 14th century shrine the time 
has come to win the hearts of the people 
in new delhi a judge formally dropped charges against four 
sikhs accused of participating in the oct 31 1984 assassination 
of mrs gandhi 
mrs gandhi was shot and killed by two sikh bodyguards angered 
by the army attack she ordered on the golden temple in june 1984 to 
drive out sikh militants using it as a base 
one assassin was shot and killed by security men the other was 
convicted along with an accomplice and both were hanged in january 
conspiracy charges were later filed against four other sikhs 
last week the government said it would withdraw the charges in a 
conciliatory move toward the sikh community 
one does wonder why the move was not made earlier said 
judge jaspal singh himself a sikh in ordering the charges dropped 
all sikhs and many hindus use the name singh which means lion 
two of the sikhs accused of conspiracy were elected to 
parliament in last months general elections in which vp singh 
and his national front coalition prevented rajiv gandhi mrs 
gandhis son and successor from returning to power 
singh was sworn in as prime minister saturday and said solving 
the sikh dispute in the northern state of punjab would be one of 
his top priorities 
on wednesday he made an effort to heal rifts between hindus and 
moslems by by appointing a moslem mufti mohammad sayeed to the 
key job of minister of home affairs religious riots this fall left 
at least 300 people dead 
his visit to the golden temple was noticeable for the almost 
total lack of bodyguards who surrounded gandhi during his public 
appearances singh traveled in an open jeep from amritsars raja 
sansi airport to the temple after refusing to sit in a bulletproof 
sedan 
your love to me is my security the prime minister told the 
gathering at the golddomed temple i have not come here for any 
political or governmental purposes i have come to perform prayers 
in the holy shrine so that peace and normalcy can be restored 
mrs gandhi was the last prime minister to visit the temple she 
came a week after the army raid 
the sikh secessionist campaign was launched by a small group of 
radicals in 1982 and exacerbated by the raid on the golden temple 
and by antisikh riots in northern india after mrs gandhis 
assassination 
at least 1200 people died in the army raid and the temple 
suffered heavy damage turning even moderate sikhs against the 
government at least 3000 sikhs were killed in ensuing riots 
sikhs easily identifiable by the their long hair flowing 
beards and colorful turbans form only 2 percent of indias 880 
million people but are a majority in punjab sikh militants say 
their community is discriminated against by the hindus who make up 
about 80 percent of the population 
officials say at least 7500 people have been killed in punjab 
since the sikh campaign began 
punjab governor sidhartha shankar ray resigned thursday and was 
replaced by nirmal kumar mukarji an appointee of the new 
government the state is ruled by the federal government in the 
absence of an elected legislative assembly and the governor is the 
top administrator

the federal election commission said thursday 
it is investigating political contributions by charles h keating 
jr the main figure in the nations largest savings and loan 
failure who arranged for 13 million in donations to the 
campaigns and causes of five senators 
the investigation initially is focusing on contributions by 
keating family members and corporate associates to sen john 
mccain rariz who requested the probe the fec said 
but the investigation could spread to four democratic senators 
who along with mccain intervened with banking regulators on 
keatings behalf if the fec feels that there are other problems 
or other violations under the federal electon campaign act 
commission spokesman scott moxley said 
the meetings with regulators began in 1987 when keatings 
lincoln savings and loan was collapsing 
the senate ethics committee is now conducting a factfinding 
inquiry into the case which has enormous political consequences 
for mccain a rising gop star and for the democrats majority whip 
alan cranston of california banking committee chairman donald w 
riegle jr of michigan governmental affairs committee chairman 
john glenn of ohio and dennis deconcini of arizona all deny 
wrongdoing 
meanwhile federal regulators asked a judge thursday to dismiss 
a suit against them by keating who contends his sampl was being 
operated soundly calls the government takeover capricious and 
arbitrary 
keating whose bank failure could cost taxpayers a record 2 
billion or more to protect depositors also contributed to other 
senators and house members and those donations also could come 
under fec scrutiny keating once asked if his financial support of 
politicians would influence them to take up his causes replied i 
want to say in the most forceful way i can i certainly hope so 
moxley the fec spokesman said the commission which 
administers the nations campaign finance laws began its 
investigation after receiving a letter from mccain oct 30 seeking 
the probe 
a spokesmen for keating was not immediately available for 
comment 
contributions to the five senators made during the mid1980s 
came from keating his immediate family members and from officials 
of his companies that included lincoln of irvine calif its 
parent phoenixbased company american continental corp and other 
subsidiaries of american continental spouses of these corporate 
officials also gave donations 
federal law limits contributions to campaigns to 1000 per 
individual for each election many of the contributions from 
keating and his associates were given on the same day in separate 
1000 donations 
for instance when the associated press requested an fec check 
of campaign contributions made on a particular day the agencys 
computer found nearly three dozen separate 1000 donations from 
keating associates or family members to thensen chic hecht 
rnev keating himself was not on the list on the day checked nov 
18 1988 
the law prohibits anyone from making a donation on behalf of 
someone else for instance keating could not have his corporate 
officers give 1000 each under their names and reimburse them 
later to skirt the donation limit 
moxley said however the law is unclear on whether someone 
could ask his associates to contribute without reimbursing them 
mccain said in his request to the fec that representatives of 
his 1982 and 1984 house campaigns and his senate campaign of 1986 
assure me that on their face those contributions comply with 
federal election law 
if these contributions resulted from illegal activities of the 
corporations who employed these contributors it is not evident in 
the committees records or on publicly available information he 
said 
but mccain expressed concern that any potentially illegal 
action by corporations and contributors be reviewed as rapidly as 
possible 
mccain received 112000 in campaign contributions from keating 
and associates and promised to promptly refund any money given 
improperly he previously announced he was reimbursing american 
continental 13433 for flights he and his family took aboard 
keatings corporate plane to and from the bahamas in 198486 
deconcini received 48100 for his 1988 reelection campaign but 
announced he was returning the money 
cranston the no 2 senate democrat as majority whip received 
39000 in campaign money he solicited from keating 850000 for 
three voter education projects in california and 85000 for the 
california democratic party the fec has jurisdiction only over 
contributions for federal campaigns 
glenn received 34000 in direct contributions and a political 
action committee associated with him was given 200000 
riegle received 76100 for his 1988 reelection campaign but 
announced he was returning the money

reeling from voters overwhelming 
rejection of three tax increases the governor is proposing 98 
million in budget cuts that could signal major changes for his 
economically strapped state 
its difficult to get people to look at the complexity of an 
issue like this democratic gov george sinner said wednesday 
i tried hard but i dont think i achieved the message i really 
dont 
he spent weeks campaigning on behalf of higher state income 
sales and gasoline taxes a year after he easily won reelection 
against a republican opponent who ran on an antitax platform 
but north dakotans thronged to the polls tuesday to defeat those 
tax measures as well as five other issues proposing mandatory seat 
belts video gambling sex education for schools legislative 
pensions and the reorganization of state government 
people were in the mood to vote no and once they started 
voting no they just kept going said former state house speaker 
tish kelly 
turnout was unofficially counted at 253429 or 53 percent of 
the states estimated voting population a record turnout for a 
special election 
of the three defeated tax measures a proposal to raise the 
state sales tax from 5 percent to 6 percent fared best it lost by 
5347 percent increases in income and gasoline taxes were rejected 
by 6040 percent 
sinners proposed cuts which are subject to legislative 
approval would hit public schools hardest elementary and 
secondary education would lose 34 million according to state 
office of management and budget documents 
the states higher education system faces a possible 24 million 
cut and state human services a 21 million reduction 
north dakotas general fund budget totals 112 billion during 
the current twoyear budgeting period which ends june 30 1991 
sinner may call lawmakers into special session early next year 
but he plans to consult legislative leaders before making his 
decision 
the state is celebrating its centennial year but its past 
decade has been bittersweet the economy relies heavily on farming 
and energy production and has suffered from drought and low prices 
for oil and wheat north dakota farmers got more than 400 million 
in drought aid last year 
the latest campaign was the governors second in three years to 
raise taxes in 1987 he took a leading role in persuading voters 
to endorse an income tax increase which was approved while the 
legislature was in session 
but wednesday he said his latest effort may have been a waste 
its easy to see why this budget is so extremely tight and 
yet the people never really seem to perceive that sinner said 
he contended tax increases are needed to maintain existing 
services sinner who has talked of running for a third term 
shrugged off questions about the political damage from his tax 
campaign 
its way too early for me to think about that said sinner 
whose fouryear term ends at the end of 1992 he added i didnt 
take the job because i wanted to perpetuate myself in office 
opponents of the tax increases said the governor has failed to 
pare spending enough and that farmers and businesses cannot afford 
a heavier tax burden 
governor sinner needs to put more of his energy into economic 
development said kent french a bismarck businessman who led 
opposition to the taxes instead hes spent his time trying to 
raise taxes 
legislators sensed anger in the vote 
there seems to be a bitterness said democratic state sen 
geraldine meyer north dakota people are short of money and 
hurting and to me the election was almost a striking out 
voters have had it with taxes and government said sen bryce 
streibel a republican 
government is no longer a servant of the people he said 
its become a monster

a safe driving record and living in a 
lowcrime area are two ways to get lower auto insurance rates but 
being elected to the legislature might be more effective 
pennsylvania and california are the only two states that 
reimburse legislators for the lease and insurance on their cars 
a vote on a compromise insurance reform bill is expected next 
week in the pennsylvania legislature where the senate in june 
voted down a proposal that would have cut rates by about 25 percent 
philadelphias rates are among the highest in the nation fueled 
in part the philadelphia inquirer said by legislation that was 
drafted by lobbyists for the insurance industry and trial lawyers 
who benefit from personalinjury lawsuits 
two state senators are not reimbursed for car insurance one 
doesnt have a drivers license or car and the other is sen james 
c greenwood all 48 other senators have the taxpayers cover most 
of their insurance premiums 
i think to the extent that every time my insurance goes up i 
feel the pain too that makes me like the people i represent 
greenwood said 
sen chakka fattah who paid 184 to insure his 1989 lincoln 
continental last year said it is unfair to say that legislators 
dont care about the insurance issue because their car insurance is 
paid by the state 
thats just like saying because we have jobs we wouldnt be 
concerned about unemployment fattah said 
state insurance commissioner constance b foster said the 
states reimbursement policy could make it more difficult for 
legislators to adopt reform legislation 
if a person is isolated from the problem its very easy to 
minimize it even if they have teenage sons and daughters she 
said foster was one of the key proponents of the insurancereform 
bill defeated by the senate in june 
foster has the use of a stateowned and insured 1989 buick 
century 
state records show that many pennsylvania lawmakers lease 
latemodel cadillacs lincolns and other luxury cars the insurance 
on those cars runs from several hundred dollars a year for rural 
legislators to thousands for philadelphia lawmakers 
under house rules representatives can be reimbursed for up to 
100 percent for their car insurance senators can be reimbursed up 
to 95 percent 
many legislators said that such a benefit is normal in business 
and that it helps them perform their jobs better they also 
disputed that the practice insulates them from the high cost of 
insurance because they still have to pay for insurance on personal 
and family cars

a jailed east german official accused of 
embezzling will fight extradition back to the communist country 
saying the growing turmoil makes a fair trial unlikely his lawyer 
said thursday 
alexander schalckgolodkowski fled the country after prosecutors 
disclosed he was operating a weapons ring selling arms to countries 
in south america africa and the middle east 
the growing scandal already has led to one suicide and the 
arrest of schalckgolodkowskis deputy for allegedly taking 110 
million in west german marks out of east germany 
such allegations are particularly embarrassing for east germany 
which for years has claimed that it needs more western currency to 
support its economy 
schalckgolodkowski had supervised the various governmentowned 
businesses that brought in the badly needed western money 
he disappeared while on an official visit to west germany on 
saturday quickly becoming the target of an international manhunt 
that added even more damaging publicity to the deeply troubled 
nation 
east germanys christian democrats a small party that recently 
broke with the communists said the allegations made the country 
look like a banana republic 
schalckgolodkowski turned himself in to west berlin authorities 
wednesday night and immediately promised to repay 31 million to 
east germany from swiss bank accounts that is only a small part of 
what east germanys official news media claim he embezzled 
in an interview with a west berlin tv station the former 
officials lawyer peter danckert said his client would resist 
being returned to east germany for trial 
danckert said that the uncertainty that we have seen 
everywhere in east berlin made a fair trial unlikely the 
national frenzy aimed at punishing past corruption has led lutheran 
church officials to warn that calls for revenge against the 
guilty were sparking widespread fears 
danckert said schalckgolodkowski would appeal to the west 
german supreme court if necessary to avoid an extradition 
on thursday west berlin prosecutor dietrich schultz said 
schalckgolodkowski would stay in jail indefinitely and that the 
former east german official feels that he is not guilty 
the west berlin prosecutor added that an extradition to east 
germany is still possible based on the communist nations arrest 
warrant for embezzlement the charge carries a maximum of 10 years 
in prison 
however schultz said his office had not turned over anyone to 
east germany for prosecution in 20 years and that it was possible 
he would be set free 
schultz said that schalckgolodkowski could be tried on the 
allegations in west germany if the east germans can prove he 
committed the crimes 
on wednesday the official east german news agency adn reported 
the suicide of an official caught two days earlier trying to leave 
a government building with two suitcases stuffed with east german 
and west german money adn did not give his name but said he was 
connected to the schalckgolodkowski case 
manfred seidel who served as schalckgolodkowskis deputy was 
arrested on suspicion of having smuggled 110 million in west 
germank marks out of the country

lobzilla a gigantic lobster spared a 
date with a boiling pot after a wave of public sympathy was flown 
from north carolina to maine by an animal rights group thursday to 
be returned to the ocean 
but the group didnt get to make the release state marine 
patrol agents confiscated the illegally oversized crustacean and 
then released it themselves 
the 21pound lobster almost got cooked and served nov 30 in 
shuckers oyster bar in charlotte nc but after some publicity 
from an animal rights group manager kurt larkins decided to give 
lobzilla to the group gratis 
larkins said the lobster measured more than 3 feet when 
stretched out 
oh hes so beautiful said cam macqueen of people for the 
ethical treatment of animals who accompanied the lobster which 
traveled in an icebox labeled eat beans not beings 
he is truly majestic incredible to look at said ms 
macqueen who estimated his age at 150 years 
carol l burnett of the washingtonbased animal rights group 
said the group picked maine for lobzillas release because state 
law does not permit the taking of lobsters whose shells measure 
more than 5 inches in order to preserve large ones for breeding 
because that law also prohibits possession of oversize lobsters 
marine patrol agents confiscated lobzilla on arrival then went 
ahead and released it

iraq claimed thursday it has testfired 
two longrange missiles and successfully launched a rocket able to 
carry satellites into space developments that could affect the 
middle easts military balance 
hussein kamel minister of industry and military 
industrialization said the threestage rocket was launched tuesday 
from the alanbar space research center 50 miles west of baghdad 
he also claimed in a statement broadcast by staterun baghdad 
radio that iraq has testfired two surfacetosurface missiles with 
a range of 1240 miles 
that is enough to reach cairo to the west athens and istanbul 
to the northwest all of iran to the east and the southern soviet 
union to the north 
iraqs other main foes israel and syria are already within 
range of missiles reported in iraqs armory 
if the iraqi claims are true the developments will heighten 
soviet and us fears of a new arms race in the middle east 
state department spokesman richard boucher said he had heard 
reports iraq had developed intercontinental ballistic missile but 
knew nothing about their validity 
kamel gave no details of the surfacetosurface missiles and did 
not say when the testfirings occurred 
the heaviest missile the iraqis are believed to have developed 
is the alhussain with a range of about 560 miles 
there was no independent confirmation of tuesdays reported 
rocket launch but iraqi tv showed what it said was footage of it 
kamel said the rocket weighed 48 tons bigger than anything the 
iraqis were believed to possess 
the us polaris nuclear missile weighs only 13 tons 
its a big leap said hansheino kopietz a middle east 
analyst with londons international institute for strategic 
studies the iraqis are known to have been working on some big 
projects and we must assume this was one of them 
what we must anticipate now if this report proves to be 
correct is how iraqs neighbors will react 
israeli officials refused comment and there was no immediate 
reaction from other middle east capitals 
kamel said the rocket will be used to launch a satellite for 
scientific research at an unspecified date 
he said the launch was the first stage of an iraqi space 
research program and called it the springboard for further 
achievements in space technology 
but it also would enable baghdad to spy on israel and iraqs 
main rivals in the region syria and iran 
iraq fought an eightyear war with iran that was halted by a 
ceasefire last year syria iraqs archrival in the arab world 
was allied with iran during the war 
iraq is the only arab country to claim the capability of 
launching satellites israel is the only middle east country known 
to have satellite capability 
iraqi president saddam hussein has been driving to develop an 
aerospace industry for some time and has spent billions of dollars 
on missile development 
the most ambitious part of the program was development of a 
twostage ballistic missile with egypt and argentina based on 
argentinas condor missile 
intelligence sources have said iraq is negotiating with brazils 
space agency and the french to help it acquire a surveillance 
satellite 
israel launched the ofek1 satellite sept 19 1988 it said 
ofek1 was designed for scientific research but arab governments 
fear it will be used as a spy satellite 
israel has said it is working on an ofek2 satellite the 
official soviet news agency tass reported the israelis launched a 
ballistic missile sept 14 
the israelis denied it but western intelligence believes the 
reported firing could have been an abortive effort to launch ofek2

rival shiite militias fought in moslem 
west beirut on thursday during a general strike to protest alleged 
attempts by michel aoun the rebellious christian general to 
partition lebanon 
police said no casualty reports were available on the battle 
between the the proiranian hezbollah and amal a more moderate 
militia supported by syria 
luckily this clash broke out on a day of general strike which 
decreases casualties among civilians said a police spokesman 
whose name was withheld in keeping with regulations 
amal and hezbollah fighters started shooting at midday in the 
densely populated basta and khandaq alghamiq districts of the 
moslem sector which is patrolled by syrian soldiers the spokesman 
reported 
he said tension was gradually spreading despite efforts by 
the syrians to contain the trouble the syrian command sent 
hundreds of its soldiers to districts bordering basta and khandaq 
alghamiq 
automatic weapons fire and the thud of exploding 
rocketpropelled grenades could be heard across west beirut and 
radio stations interrupted regular programming with reports on the 
violence 
the police spokesman said the confrontation could spread 
quickly 
fighting broke out in beirut two days after hezbollah drove amal 
from the western part of the syrianoccupied bekaa valley in east 
beirut destroying the five major amal bases in sohmor yohmor and 
mashgara villages 
police gave casualties in the bekaa confrontation as 17 
combatants killed 16 from amal and one from hezbollah and 42 
wounded 
the two factions have fought since may 1987 for supremacy among 
the 12 million shiites lebanons largest sect police say 552 
people have been killed and 1532 wounded 
leaders of the national front alliance of prosyrian leftist and 
moslem groups called the strike in moslem areas to denounce 
attempts to partition the nation 
president elias hrawi a christian like aoun presided over a 
meeting of his government at an army barracks in syrianpoliced 
east lebanon and issued a statement saying several decisions 
were adopted regarding ways of ending the partition scheme no 
details were given 
the government urged all concerned to join the unifying policy 
of the legal authority to abort the partition scheme 
moderate christian leaders have joined moslems in supporting 
hrawi who was elected by parliament on nov 23 with a mandate to 
implement a peace agreement designed to end the 14yearold civil 
war 
aoun rejected hrawis election and opposes the peace accord 
because it does not include a timetable for withdrawal of syrias 
40000 troops from lebanon he commands 20000 christian troops 
from a bunker beneath the presidential palace in the christian 
suburb of baabda and refuses to leave 
syria has ringed the 310squaremile christian enclave east and 
north of beirut with tanks artillery and thousands of soldiers 
hrawi has given mediators two weeks to convince aoun to leave the 
palace peacefully

an appeals court on thursday upheld the acquittal of 
director martin scorsese who was charged with contempt of religion 
for his film the last temptation of christ 
scorsese and biennale festival director paolo portoghesi were 
cleared of violating italian laws on obscenity and blasphemy in the 
showing of the movie at the venice film festival 
judges initially decided to take no action against scorsese or 
the festival organizer but an appeals court in rome ruled the case 
should be considered by a venice criminal court which found 
scorsese and portoghesi innocent 
the rome courts upholding of the acquittal is final because 
the supreme court has declined to accept the case 
protesters who prompted the criminal case in fall 1988 said the 
movie was sacrilegious particularly a scene in which jesus 
hallucinates on the cross about abandoning his role as redeemer 
making love to mary magdalene and raising a family with her

a judge ruled that an 
airconditioner repairman who believes his father is doowop singer 
dion dimucci cannot bring a paternity lawsuit 
dion ambrogio 32 is 10 years too late in suing palm beach 
circuit judge walter colbath said wednesday citing a state law 
that bars a paternity action once the child reaches age 22 
im disappointed said ambrogio dion wantign contributions made 
on a particular day the agencys 
computer found nearly three dozen separate 1000 donations from 
keating associates or family members to thensen chic hecht 
rnev keating himself was not on the list on the day checked nov 
18 1988 
the law prohibits anyone from making a donation on behalf of 
someone else for instance keating could not have his corporate 
officers give 1000 each under their names and reimburse them 
later to skirt the donation limit 
moxley said however the law is unclear on whether someone 
could ask his associates to contribute without reimbursing them 
mccain said in his request to the fec that representatives of 
his 1982 and 1984 house campaigns and his senate campaign of 1986 
assure me that on their face those contributions comply with 
federal election law 
if these contributions resulted from illegal activities of the 
corporations who employed these contributors it is not evident in 
the committees records or on publicly available information he 
said 
but mccain expressed concern that any potentially illegal 
action by corporations and contributors be reviewed as rapidly as 
possible 
mccain received 112000 in campaign contributions from keating 
and associates and promised to promptly refund any money given 
improperly he previously announced he was reimbursing american 
continental 13433 for flights he and his family took aboard 
keatings corporate plane to and from the bahamas in 198486 
deconcini received 48100 for his 1988 reelection campaign but 
announced he was returning the money 
cranston the no 2 senate democrat as majority whip received 
39000 in campaign money he solicited from keating 850000 for 
three voter education projects in california and 85000 for the 
california democratic party the fec has jurisdiction only over 
contributions for federal campaigns 
glenn received 34000 in direct contributions and a political

president bush signed legislation thursday 
giving the attorney general the authority to settle claims of up to 
50000 for injuries or damage caused by fbi agents executing their 
duties 
the measure amends a 1936 statute that had limited such damage 
payments to 500 
it also expands the settlement authority to cover other federal 
law enforcement agencies including the drug enforcement 
administration the immigration and naturalization service the 
us marshals service and the bureau of prisons 
the expanded settlement authority is intended to cover incidents 
ranging from broken walls and doors to personal injury or deaths 
resulting from properly executed law enforcement activities by the 
fbi and other federal agencies 
if negligence were involved the victims already had a right to 
sue the government for much larger damages than 500 under the 
federal tort claims act

president fw de klerk 
announced a major defense cutback thursday cutting mandatory 
military service in half and promising to close some military units 
and facilities 
he also suggested that some career military men and employees of 
the national arms manufacturing company may lose their jobs 
the announcement came two weeks after south africa completed the 
withdrawal of its troops from namibia where they had fought a bush 
war against proindependence guerrillas since 1966 a year ago 
south africa signed a treaty that cleared the way for namibias 
independence and also halted south african involvement in the civil 
war in angola namibias northern neighbor 
de klerks announcement marked the second time in 10 days he has 
taken action counter to standing policies of the security 
establishment that held strong influence under his predecessor 
pw botha on nov 28 de klerk scrapped a nationwide security 
network that was denounced as an unaccountable shadow government 
when the namibian and south africanangolan wars ended defense 
force chiefs and the defense minsiter magnus malan had said there 
would be no cutbacks or service reductions because the government 
still had to defend its borders against guerrilla infiltration from 
surrounding countries 
last week malan reversed himself saying it was no longer 
necessary for south african forces to stage crossborder raids or 
support antigovernment groups in neighboring countries the 
military units de klerk has suggested eliminating may be those 
involved in such clandestine actions he said details would be 
given next year 
zach de beer a leader of the antiapartheid democratic party 
said de klerks action was an indication that the relationship 
between ourselves and our neighbors in southern africa have 
improved and we look forward to a more peaceful time 
the conservative party is concerned that the state 
presidents unilateral and overhasty decision will be detrimental 
to state security said koos van der merwe defense spokesman for 
the largest white opposition party he warned against creation of a 
peace pscyhosis when he said the outlawed african national 
congress was continuing its guerrilla actions 
van der merwe suggested that rather than reducing the strength 
of the defense force the extra soldiers be assigned to the 
undermanned police force and that black indian and mixedrace men 
also be subject to conscription now only white men can be 
conscripted military service for other races is voluntary 
de beer as well as several business organizations said the 
reduction in military service would help the economy by slowing the 
brain drain of young men who leave the country rather than 
serve diminish disruption of careers and allow more educated men 
to enter the workforce earlier 
de klerk opening a new headquarters for the state arms 
manufacturing corporation indicated that conscripts already in the 
military would have their terms of service shortened new draftees 
would serve one year instead of two and the number of recalls to 
temporary service would be reduced 
the end conscription campaign a restricted organization that 
wants young men to be given a choice between military and community 
service said this reduction does not remove the huge dilemma 
facing conscripts who still have to choose whether to serve in an 
apartheid army 
in september 780 white men vowed not to perform military 
service the largest defiance ever of conscription laws 
draft resisters face prison terms of up to six years or 1 
times the amount of unfulfilled service three men are serving 
sixyear terms 
the government does not release information on the manpower of 
the armed forces however at any given time in recent years there 
have been as estimated 68000 conscripts on active duty and about 
325000 men in the reserves out of the roughly 24 million white 
males of all ages in south africa 
the president said efforts would be made to find new jobs for 
career military personnel and employees of armscor the 
governmentowned weapons company who might lose their jobs as part 
of the cutback

a senior state department official said 
thursday that nicaraguas government has embarked on a clear 
pattern of abuses designed to intimidate opposition political 
activists and voters before februarys national elections 
john bolton assistant secretary of state for international 
organization affairs said the political opposition has grown to 
represent a real threat to continued sandinista power in nicaragua 
and the government has responded with tactics designed to 
discredit confuse and intimidate the opposition and its 
supporters 
bolton also released a letter he had sent this week to elliot 
richardson the chief un observer of nicaraguas elections 
detailing more than a dozen attacks and threats aimed at opposition 
political figures and their supporters in recent weeks 
bolton said the incidents would make it difficult for 
richardson a former attorney general to certify following the 
feb 25 voting that the elections were free and fair in accordance 
with a regional peace agreement signed by the leftist sandinista 
regime and its four central american neighbors 
in a speech at the state department bolton said that virgilio 
godoy the vice presidential candidate of the opposition coalition 
uno had been stopped by soldiers on nov 26 in the town of 
pantasma when godoy complained that two of his supporters had been 
beaten and detained by the army the soldiers responded that the 
opposition had been throwing rocks and then threatened to fire on 
the candidate and his party 
that and other incidents present a clear pattern of abuses 
designed to interfere with the open free and fair electoral 
process that the sandinistas are pledged to uphold bolton said 
bolton in a letter to richardson also cited the nicaraguan 
governments refusal to provide visas for a 20member us 
congressional election observer group appointed by president bush 
in rejecting the visa requests last week nicaragua said the 
united states could not claim objectivity because it was providing 
9 million in support to the electoral process to enhance unos 
chances and was continuing to funnel support to the antisandinista 
contra rebels many of whom have reinfiltrated into nicaragua 
bolton dismissed those arguments noting that humanitarian 
aid to the rebels is permitted in the regional peace accord and 
that nicaraguan law permits outside financial aid to political 
parties

sixtyeight human rights monitors were killed 
worldwide in the last year double the number in the previous 12 
months an international human rights monitoring organization said 
thursday 
human rights watch said 63 of the killings were in countries 
usually considered to be democratic but added in its annual report 
that the danger in democratic countries is of course not an 
argument in favor of dictatorships of the right or of the left 
the organization said it had little or no information on 
persecutions of human rights monitors in albania iran iraq north 
korea romania or saudi arabia because it is virtually impossible 
for citizens in those countries to monitor government activities 
nevertheless the report said the dangers that attend efforts 
to monitor and defend human rights in some democracies should 
give pause to those who have celebrated the democratic tide that 
has swept across the world in the 1980s 
at least in a number of latin american and east asian 
countries the advent of electoral democracy has not meant great 
advances in respect for human rights 
it is when a certain degree of openness prevails but when the 
rule of law has not been established that the perils are 
greatest the organization said 
in colombia where the group said a history of human rights 
violations has been exacerbated by the violence associated with the 
drug trade 24 human rights monitors were killed more than in any 
other country 
brazil was second with 14 and many of the cases reflect the 
intense struggle over land distribution in rural areas human 
rights watch said 
the 345page report discussed 1200 cases of persecution of 
human rights monitors in 72 countries including arrest 
imprisonment and torture of people who gather and disseminate 
information on their own governments human rights abuses 
aryeh neier executive director of human rights watch said 
czechoslovakia where a new reformist government has come to power 
was second only to south africa in the total number of cases but 
he said many of those listed had been released about two weeks 
before the report was issued 
not all the people we care about in czechoslovakia have yet 
been released so there is a way to go neier added 
south africa takes up 36 pages in the report and czechoslovakia 
23 
the report devoted only six pages to china but said some of the 
thousands arrested after the june 34 disturbances in tiananmen 
square were known to have been signers of statements and petitions 
on human rights issues 
in addition to the 68 killings 10 more human rights monitors 
disappeared after being taken into custody the organization 
said 
human rights watch is made up of five regional committees 
africa watch americas watch asia watch helsinki watch and middle 
east watch it is headquartered in new york

advocates of forcing sampl owners to back their lending with more 
of their own money say the measure will encourage institutions to 
avoid risky investments that could run up big losses for the 
government deposit insurance fund 
of the 1100 institutions falling short of the standard about 
300 are already insolvent and due to be transferred to the 
resolution trust corp for liquidation 
of the 800 remaining about 270 likely will be able to shrink or 
raise capital on their own and about 230 likely wont be able to do 
it before mandatory growth restrictions take effect on jan 1 
1991 m danny wall director of the thrift office said thursday 
then 300 in the middle are candidates for the matchmaker 
program blind dates arranged marriages however you want to put 
it wall told the association of government accountants thursday 
in a reference to a thrift office program aimed at matching weak 
sampls with merger partners 
private analysts however are skeptical about the prospects for 
capitaldeficient institutions 
there are very good reasons to question whether the guys in 
the middle will survive certainly in their present form litan 
said the most likely strategy will be shrinkage because they 
will not be successful in attracting new capital theres a pall 
hanging over the entire thrift industry which makes investors 
nervous 
anticipating the rules sampls have been shrinking shedding a 
record 152 billion in assets in september and 133 billion in 
august according to the latest report available 
litan and another economist paul getman of the wefa group in 
bala cynwyd pa said another provision in the thrift bill 
requiring sampls to concentrate 70 percent of their assets on housing 
loans up from 60 percent is discouraging investors and virtually 
forcing the shrinkage 
congress is saying to thrifts put all your eggs in one 
basket and that basket is looking real shaky getman said 
noting weakening real estate markets in the northeast on top of 
already soft markets in the southwest 
this is setting up the industry for what will be a knockout 
punch in the early 1990s he said predicting that the southeast 
will be the next region with real estate problems 
the right analogy to draw for these 800 thrifts is they are 
like prisoners on death row they have another 15 years to live 
getman said

the solidarityled government said 
thursday it wont tolerate more demonstrations at monument to lenin 
where antisoviet protesters trying to destroy the statue have 
twice clashed with police 
protesters chanting soviets go home hurled paint gasoline 
and explosives at the monument and fueled the fire with park 
benches in a demonstration that lasted until midnight wednesday 
police used water cannon and tear gas to disperse the 
demonstrators after they marched to a militia headquarters pelted 
officers with stones and tossed molotov cocktails the official pap 
news agency reported 
twenty people were injured 13 of them police pap said damage 
was estimated at 6000 including a jewelry store looted after its 
windows were smashed 
another demonstration turned violent nov 29 at the statue to 
the founder of the soviet state that dominates a square in the 
krakow suburb of nowa huta built in the 1950s as a model socialist 
industrial city 
the problem of the location of the monument should be decided 
by inhabitants of this district of krakow in legal forums the 
government statement said 
vandalism and hooliganism are something else such activities 
cannot be tolerated it continued the forces of order acting 
in accordance with the law will be forced to take firmer steps in 
order to prevent such dangerous excesses 
the youthful demonstrators gathered by a radical group known as 
movement for an alternative society have been an embarrassment for 
the government of prime minister taduesz mazowiecki formed of 
former opposition forces who now must maintain relations with the 
soviet union 
the police action nov 29 was apparently the first largescale 
use of force against demonstrators since solidarity took over the 
government in august 
the solidarity committee for the southern poland region has 
adopted a resolution asking local authorities to remove the lenin 
monument to prevent further disturbances pap reported thursday 
our resolution is not dictated by political reasons but by 
concern over security and order in the city it said according 
to pap 
if a decision manifesting the will of society is not made 
immediately stability will be threatened and district and 
municipal authorities will be to blame it said 
not freely elected the peoples councils that form local 
governments have yet not been subject to the reform sweeping 
through the central government and are still dominated by communist 
party members 
stanislaw suchonski a member of the krakow council told pap 
two possible solutions were being considered either to prevent 
such further events or having heard the opinion of nowa huta 
inhabitants to move the monument to a different place 
edward nowak a solidarity parliament deputy serving as a 
mediator in the monument dispute said thursday that only removal 
of the statue can end the demonstrations pap reported

agriculture department said thursday 
f paul dickerson general sales manager for the departments 
foreign agricultural service said shipments are scheduled in 
january and february 
the wheat was sold under the departments export enhancement 
program or eep which provides subsidies to exporters selling us 
commodities to designated foreign markets

unions current eep allocation of 15 million tons announced may 2

thousands of children and grownups jammed a park 
where george bush once coached girls softball to show the 
president thursday how they reclaimed the playground from drug 
dealers 
bush said he was proud of the neighborhood for joining together 
on what they call independence day april 9 1988 when 1000 
people went out to take andrew winzer park back from drug dealers 
thank you not only for standing up to greet me but also for 
standing up for houston every day said bush noting that at one 
time the park had been so clogged with drug dealers even houston 
police called it crack in the box 
bands drill teams cheerleaders choirs school mascots even 
a few children skipping school lined up hours before the 
president arrived in northeast houston to review the results of the 
acres homes war on drugs 
joining bush for the 20minute ceremony were federal drug czar 
william bennett who visited the park in july and treasury 
secretary nicholas brady the visit was part of the presidents 
twoday trip to texas iowa and colorado to spotlight antidrug 
efforts and boost republican candidates 
in his remarks bush referred jocularly to the time he coached 
softball at the park during his congressional service in the 1960s 
it was a great bunch of girls they almost won state said 
bush in fact i think i see our third baseman over there he 
said drawing a laugh from the crowd 
the festive atmosphere thursday was in stark contrast to the 
situation in the area two years ago when drug dealers dominated 
the neighborhood 
it was sad said john phillips a former high school 
football coach i used to drive by here at lunch there would be 
25 cars lined up there for four or five guys selling whatever you 
wanted families just stopped coming here people were afraid 
the neighbors banded together got their children involved and 
started an aggressive neighborhood watch program that included 
writing down license numbers and turning alleged drug dealers into 
police 
bush drew applause when he quoted erma scales president of the 
acres homes war on drugs as saying we need to teach our system 
of values parents need to spend more time with their kids and 
go back to being parents not just being buddies he said 
kenneth scott 34 came out thursday with his 3yearold 
daughter keandra 
its nice and peaceful now but it was a lot of drug dealers 
and drug addicts here it was just in turmoil i couldnt bring my 
kid out here they would run out to every passing car and ask every 
passing car to buy drugs 
but now thats all changed i love it here 
but police said the job is not finished 
as crews worked wednesday to ready the park for the presidents 
visit undercover police officers made three arrests in an hour for 
the sale of crack cocaine within a mile of the park

chancellor helmut kohls political 
foes on thursday complained that the governments tentative plans 
to shrink its military forces by nearly onefifth do not go far 
enough 
a day earlier the government announced it intended to cut its 
forces from 480000 members to 400000 by the mid1990s but only 
if current eastwest talks on reducing conventional forces in 
europe are successful 
it would be the biggest reduction in west germanys armed forces 
ever 
but andreas von buelow a federal lawmaker with the opposition 
social democratic party said defense minister gerhard 
stoltenbergs plan doesnt do enough to encourage disarmament and 
to help overcome divisions within europe 
why dont you stoltenberg work toward a structure that 
allows you to actively hurry along the demilitarization of the 
eastwest conflict that would still protect our security buelow 
asked stoltenberg at a heated parliamentary debate 
the social democrats demanded that compulsory military service 
be cut from 15 months to 12 months 
buelow also said west germany and nato should be thinking of 
possible ways to alter the character of the armed forces so there 
werent so many offenseoriented elements 
but stoltenberg said his plan foresaw the most significant 
newordering in the history of the federal republics west 
germanys armed forces 
pointing out that west germany remained natos frontline state 
stoltenberg said the countrys armed forces are an essential 
factor for stability in europe and that this must not be 
jeopardized 
it would be disastrous to put into question the alliances and 
the west german armys roles as key elements for peace 
stoltenberg said 
in announcing its plan wednesday the government said it was 
taking the tentative steps to cut down on costs because of west 
germanys low birth rate which means there will be fewer men for 
the armed forces and because of the changing political situation 
in europe 
the demise of communist governments in eastern europe has 
triggered a new debate in west germany about what kinds of changes 
are possible within the countrys own armed forces and within nato 
as a whole 
the social democrats and the leftist greens party have been 
leading the calls for farreaching changes saying the threat from 
the east bloc has decreased dramatically 
kohls government says it wants quicker progress in arms control 
and disarmament but it has also pledged west germany will remain a 
nato member even if events in europe eventually permit unification 
of the two german nations 
some liberal members of kohls government have strayed from 
official government pronouncements on military matters 
education minister juergen moellemann a member of the free 
democrat party junior partner in kohls coalition government has 
said he thought 350000 soldiers in the countrys armed forces and 
a 12month military service term would be sufficient

a substantially higher number of hispanic 
americans are overweight when compared to the rest of the nation 
federal researchers reported thursday 
a survey of mexican americans in the west cuban americans in 
miami and puerto ricans in metropolitan new york found overweight 
problems to be substantially higher than those reported for 
nonhispanic americans the national centers for disease control 
reported 
among mexican americans 30 percent of men and 39 percent of 
women were overweight the cdc said among cuban americans 29 
percent of men and 34 percent of women were overweight and among 
puerto ricans 25 percent of men and 37 percent of women were 
overweight 
among nonhispanics in another survey overweight men accounted 
for 24 percent of whites and 25 percent of blacks among women it 
was 25 percent of whites and 44 percent of blacks 
the three hispanic groups chosen account for about threefourths 
of the hispanic population in the united states the cdc said 
while the survey was not nationwide it was a scientifically based 
sample in those three areas said michael rowland a researcher 
with the cdcs national center for health statistics 
the reasons for a trend toward overweight among hispanic 
americans are pure conjecture said dr david f williamson of 
the cdc 
he noted that hispanic americans in general have lower income 
and education status than do white americans and people at the 
lower end of socioeconomics are at greater risk of being overweight 
this is an especially strong pattern among women why that is 
he said is again up for debate 
the surveys were conducted as part of the statistics centers 
hispanic health and nutrition examination survey between 198284 
the term overweight in the survey was used for anyone whose 
body mass index a measurement of height and weight was in 
the top 15 percent of men or women in their 20s 
severely overweight indicated the top 5 percent that 
designation applied to between 8 to 10 percent of hispanicamerican 
men and 8 to 16 percent of hispanicamerican women compared with 
generally lower levels for nonhispanics the cdc said

the citrus canker scare that led to the 
burning of 20 million fruit trees in the mid1980s reached the 
states highest court thursday with growers arguing that a 
compensation plan violates their rights 
attorneys for citrus growers and nursery owners told the florida 
supreme court that a law passed by the legislature last spring 
providing a 30 million compensation fund and setting up an 
administrative hearing procedure denied them the right to have 
their day in court 
claims pending before the state list damages of at least 200 
million 
jim moody one of three citrus industry attorneys said the plan 
was wrong because the legislature also made the decisions leading 
to the burning of the trees under basic separation of powers 
protections he said the courts are the correct forum for settling 
on payment for losses 
the constitution is what protects us from our own 
government moody said are we going to let those taking the 
property determine the compensation for the property the answer is 
no 
millions of citrus trees mostly seedlings were destroyed 
beginning in 1984 to halt the spread of canker a disease that can 
lead to premature fruit drop and loss of the crop 
scientists have since concluded that most of the trees diagnosed 
with canker were suffering from a relatively harmless leafspotting 
disease and most regulations aimed at preventing the spread of 
canker have been dropped 
lower courts supported the states authority to destroy the 
trees because of fears that a serious disease was threatening the 
states 1 billion citrus industry but courts also have ruled that 
full compensation for destroyed trees is required 
attorney general bob butterworth said there are about 1100 
claims stemming from the canker eradication program if those 
claims were taken to court butterworth said it could cost the 
state at least 200 million 
seventysix canker compensation cases have been filed in courts 
around the state but the law passed last spring freezes them and 
directs they also go through an administrative process 
a hillsborough county judge ruled the law unconstitutional one 
day after it was signed by gov bob martinez and the state 
appealed 
robert shevin a former state attorney general representing the 
legislature said the compensation program gives growers a way to 
press their claims in a reasonable way 
we admit liability we pay these folks shevin said we 
believe weve provided an adequate alternative remedy that has 
adequate safeguards to ensure just compensation 
another government attorney parker thomson said the system 
keeps intact growers constitutional rights to a hearing 
i submit that there is no substantive right diminished much 
less taken away by this statute said thomson representing 
butterworth 
moody and steven turner another citrus industry attorney said 
the florida constitution protects a property owners right to 
compensation when property is seized by government but more 
importantly mandates that such a decision be made in a court 
turner also said the law should not be applied retroactively to 
claims that already had been filed in state courts 
the justices did not indicate when they would rule

america should seize and support 
opportunities to reduce international tensions the commander of 
us forces in the pacific said thursday in commemorating the 48th 
anniversary of the pearl harbor attack but when we perceive a 
threat against the interests and security of the nation we must 
continue to speak out even if the tide of public opinion is 
running the other way said adm huntington hardisty during a 
navy ceremony aboard the uss arizona memorial 
hardisty noted that an 18yearold sailor lost in the dec 7 
1941 attack by japan would now be 66 
that sailor would be pleased to see that the pacific command is 
waging peace hardisty told about 100 invited guests 
he would be pleased to see that our nations security posture 
in the pacific is in good shape hardisty said but i also 
think the sailor would sound a warning that peace requires strong 
credible forces and constant vigilence 
a minute of silence was observed at 755 am the time the air 
raid began the minute ended with a flyover by hawaii air national 
guard jets in the missing man formation 
representatives of veterans civic and patriotic organizations 
presented wreaths during the ceremony which also included prayers 
and a 21gun salute 
among those attending were us reps daniel akaka dhawaii 
martin lancaster dnc marvin leath dtexas and david ob 
martin rny hawaii gov john waihee and other pacific military 
commanders 
about 900 people attended a public service held simultaneously 
at the arizona memorial visitor center 
retired rear adm victor a dybdal who was a gunnery officer 
aboard the uss helm at the time of the pearl harbor attack was the 
keynote speaker 
he gave a personal account paid tribute to those who died and 
said america must remain strong even with recent developments in 
europe and the soviet union 
we should support the movements toward democracy and freedom 
but remember that the huge military strength of the soviet union is 
still there he said 
the national park service ceremony included prayers by the world 
federation japan religious committee 
some pearl harbor survivors scattered across the country 
attended commemorations without returning to hawaii 
in harrisburg pa for example gov robert p casey told about 
50 pearl harbor survivors they were in the front line of the 
fight for freedom that is taking place in eastern europe 
you stand for peace and freedom the peace and freedom that we 
all enjoy that others strive for and that can never be taken for 
granted you are living reminders of where we have been of our 
goals and of our aspirations

the house armed services committee chairman 
charged thursday that the bush administration bungled the 
announcement of future cuts in defense spending by failing to spell 
out a military strategy 
rep les aspin dwis said defense secretary dick cheney 
directed the services to come up with ways to slash 180 billion 
from pentagon spending during fiscal 1992 to fiscal 1994 but 
provided no policy guidance 
without a strategy the administration faces the likelihood of 
the defense budget being crafted by lawmakers concerned with 
parochial interests instead of by the administration aspin said 
in the last couple of weeks the administration has fumbled the 
defense budget ball big time aspin said in a speech to the 
national security industrial association 
the wisconsin democrat said the budget exercise asked the 
services where they would cut it didnt tell them what threats to 
assume what roles to emphasize or what missions to minimize 
complicating the situation was cheneys decision to discuss the 
cuts in published reports and television interviews aspin said 
the cuts according to the lawmaker will come from unrealistic 
budget totals envisioned by the pentagon and in the long run will 
amount to substantial but no massive reductions 
if we compare it to the fiveyear defense plan that they are 
now working with in the pentagon a cut of 180 billion in 1992 
1993 and 1994 would mean a reduction of about 45 percent per year 
in each of those years thats in real terms after accounting for 
inflation aspin said 
the problems stemming from the administrations handling of the 
issue will be worse if it falters in producing a strategy for the 
budget cuts aspin said 
when your defense budget is not supported by a military 
strategy it will be patched together with a pork strategy aspin 
said of course even if you have a military strategy it is hard 
to fend off a pork strategy but if you have no military strategy 
you have no chance 
aspin said the administration faces allegations that it will be 
fashioning a strategy to fit the budget 
nevertheless the administration must reopen the debate over 
soviet military capabilities and intentions in a time of 
fastmoving events in eastern europe 
the administration then must outline a strategy to ensure that 
the united states gets the most for its reduced defense dollars 
aspin said

about 2500 east germans marched through the 
city center late thursday shouting slogans against the communist 
party and the countrys oncefeared secret police 
hundreds of the demonstators blew shrill earpiercing whistles 
and shouted for the secret police to stop meddling in citizens 
affairs 
imprison the communists the marchers demanded referring to 
disgraced former leaders accused of having misused their offices or 
made off with state funds during four decades of communist rule in 
east germany 
the rally which started at east berlins sprawling 
alexanderplatz followed the broad marxengelsforum boulevard and 
passed city hall included demonstrators who hoisted signs calling 
for free elections next year 
we demand quick free elections and the communists must now 
pay for the mistakes of misery placards read we have had 
enough of election fraud 
former communist party chief egon krenz was forced to resign 
from his posts as party leader and president this week following 
accusations that he allowed approval of falsified april election 
results 
two demonstrators carried a sign showing a caricature of a man 
shredding polling records 
another sign denounced krenz and west german chancellor helmut 
kohl who has offered a plan for german reunification 
we need neither krenz nor kohl well only feel well when we 
govern ourselves the sign read 
there had been reports the demonstrators would march on the 
secret police headquarters in east berlin but the demonstrators 
never passed the building 
about 200 demonstrators broke off from the main column at the 
communist party headquarters where they shouted come out come 
out we are peaceful 
police presence as the march wound through the city was 
negligible 
at one point a policeman using the megaphone of a patrol car 
shouted attention attention this is the peoples police 
please use the sidewalks you are disrupting traffic 
the marchers ignored the order booing and jeering the police 
did nothing 
people in a hotel along the route cheered on the marchers who 
waved back 
at about the same time about 30 demonstrators from west berlin 
pushed their way to the front of the column of marchers and shouted 
antinazi slogans 
part of the procession marched by the dietrichbonhoeffer

premier ladislav adamec resigned 
thursday while still bargaining with the powerful opposition which 
has told the communists to form an acceptable government or face 
another general strike 
adamec 63 announced his resignation at a meeting with 
noncommunist party officials about changes in the government said 
bohuslav kucera of the socialist party he quoted adamec as saying 
a new younger leader was needed to achieve a compromise 
president gustav husak asked deputy premier marian calfa 43 to 
take over and continue searching for a solution the official ctk 
news agency reported 
calfa a communist has attended most of adamecs recent 
meetings with opposition leaders who rejected the cabinet he 
formed last sunday 
adamec had been expected to name a new government friday that 
would involve some form of power sharing with the opposition which 
in a few weeks has become strong enough to break the communist 
partys 41year monopoly on power 
the civic forum opposition movement and its slovak counterpart 
public against violence have threatened a nationwide general 
strike for monday if a satisfactory government has not been formed 
civic forum leader vaclav havel a playwright whose works have 
been banned in czechoslovakia was asked whether he would accept 
the state presidency if it was offered his reply 
i have repeatedly said that my occupation is a writer and that 
i have no political ambitions i dont feel myself to be a 
professional politician but have always put the public interest 
ahead of my own 
and if god help us the situation should develop in such a 
way that the only service i could render my country would be to do 
this then of course i would do it 
havel added later that no one was promoting his candidacy and he 
would accept it only if there was no other way out of the political 
crisis 
leaders of civic forum appeared on the main evening newscast 
with a list of names they gave adamec as possible cabinet members 
only hours before he resigned 
zdenek jicinsky said one proposal was that slovak dissident jan 
carnogursky be made first deputy premier and other deputy premiers 
be named from the socialist party and the peoples party 
carnogursky had been imprisoned since august and was freed 12 days 
ago 
civic forum also proposed its current spokesman jiri 
dienstbier as foreign minister and economist vaclav klaus a 
member as finance minister 
jicinsky said petr miller a worker at the ckd industrial plant 
in prague and senior civic forum representative was suggested as 
social affairs minister 
there was no official reaction to the proposals 
adamecs resignation was the latest capitulation to a 
prodemocracy movement that in less than a month has forced the 
communists to relinquish their monopoly and dismiss leaders 
associated with the crushing of the prague spring reforms of 1968 
the ruling politburo stripped former party chief milos jakes and 
miroslav stepan the former prague party boss of party membership 
thursday accusing them of grave political mistakes in resolving 
social tensions 
mentioned specifically was the brutal police action against 
peaceful protesters nov 17 which started the mass protest that 
brought the party down action against those responsible for the 
brutality has been a key opposition demand 
also at the thursday meeting the politburo established a 
commission to investigate serious cases of abuse of office by 
certain party officials and said a special party congress would 
be moved up from january to dec 2021 
kucera said his socialist party formally allied with the 
communists but increasingly independent hoped to have at least two 
ministers in the new government 
the peoples party another former communist ally now asserting 
independence has said it wants calfa to form a government with 
half the ministries run by people who have no aparty affiliation 
it wants the other 50 percent divided among the communists 
itself the socialists and two small officially recognized parties 
in slovakia ctk reported 
adamec left halfway through the twohour meeting with other 
parties thrusday striding grimly toward his official sedan in 
silence 
he became premier in october 1988 and said last week that 
communist party leaders often had frustrated his plans for reform 
party chief karel urbanek and several members of the ruling 
politburo were present at the meeting in which adamec resigned 
in a televised address wednesday adamec had said he would quit 
if the opposition did not stop presenting ultimatums 
on thursday opposition leaders rejected charges that it had put 
adamec under pressure to change the communistdominated cabinet 
sworn in last sunday which they rejected because it included only 
five noncommunists 
they want a new interim government to build the legal basis for 
parliamentary democracy and hold free elections by july 
on monday hundreds of thousands of people demonstrated in 
prague and bratislava czechoslovakias two largest cities against 
adamecs new cabinet he reopened negotations with the opposition

in a videotape played thursday former philippine 
president ferdinand marcos invoked the fifth amendment when asked 
about a slush fund allegedly used to pay for the murders of two 
antimarcos activists in seattle 
the deposition from the late philippine ruler was played in a 
wrongfuldeath lawsuit filed by the families of silme domingo and 
gene viernes who were shot in offices of the alaska cannery 
workers union here in june 1981 
three men were convicted of the murders on the theory that the 
victims were working to eliminate gang influence on work 
assignments and gambling in alaska fish canneries 
the us district court lawsuit however claims the murder plot 
actually was hatched in manila because of domingos and viernes 
antimarcos activism 
the plaintiffs claim 15000 was paid for the murders from an 
intelligence slush fund that was administered by a company the 
mabuhay corp of san francisco which was run by dr leonilo 
malabed 
marcos has admitted malabed was a friend but invoked his fifth 
amendment privilege against selfincrimination on all questions 
regarding intelligence funding and the mabuhay company 
he gave his deposition during two sessions in 1986 and 1987 
after he fled to hawaii following the february 1986 overthrow of 
his government marcos died last september 
marcos his wife imelda the philippine government and others 
are defendants in the suit which seeks 30 million in damages 
the questions marcos would not answer were 
whether the philippines national bank was used to channel money 
to the united states for intelligence operations in the late 1970s 
and 1980s 
whether he authorized the use of up to 1 million in pnb money 
to create the mabuhay corp 
whether pnb money went to mabuhay and was used to conduct 
acts of physical violence against the antimarcos opposition 
including and up to the use of murder political assassination and 
summary execution 
whether he was aware of malabeds effort to buy a radio 
station the purpose for which mabuhay allegedly was established 
marcos also refused to answer when asked directly whether 
mabuhay was used as an intelligence slush fund that provided 
15000 on may 17 1981 for the domingo and viernes murders that 
exchange was disallowed by us district judge barbara rothstein 
and edited out of the video but included in the full transcript of 
the deposition 
among the key documents in the trial is one that plaintiffs 
claim is an mabuhay account sheet for the slush fund under a 
heading for security projects is a may 17 entry for 15000 
plaintiffs claim former canneryunion president constantine 
baruso whose gun was used in the killings was in san francisco on 
that date to pick up the money baruso who was never criminally 
charged in the murders also invoked the fifth amendment 75 times 
during his testimony earlier in the lawsuit trial 
in testimony shown wednesday for a 1986 deposition session 
marcos admitted four philippine intelligence agencies operated in 
the united states during his martiallaw regime but he denied they 
would have used strongarm tactics he said he didnt become 
concerned about antimarcos opposition in the united states until 
about 1984

federal regulators asked a judge thursday to 
dismiss a suit against them by the former owner of lincoln savings 
and loan association saying they can show phoenix millionaire 
charles h keating jr was operating the thrift in violation of the 
law 
deals that the hearing is focusing on are literally just the 
tip of the iceberg james p murphy an attorney for the treasury 
departments office of thrift supervision told us district court 
judge stanley sporkin 
under an arrangement approved by attorneys for both sides a 
sample of four deals two land transactions a taxsharing 
arrangement between lincoln and its holding company and a deal 
involving stock will occupy the two days of hearings that began 
thursday 
i assume you picked the worst ones sporkin a former chief 
enforcement officer for the securities and exchange commission 
said to murphy the judge ordered the hearing on the governments 
motion to dismiss keatings suit in what regulators say will end up 
as the costliest sampl collapse in history 
last may a month after regulators seized keatings irvine 
calif thrift he filed the suit seeking to nullify the 
governments action regulators contended the sampl had lost between 
1 billion and 25 billion in federally insured deposits through 
fraud risky investments and sham real estate transactions 
the government has summoned keating to appear as a witness 
the target of a federal grand jury investigation in los angeles 
keating invoked his fifth amendment right against 
selfincrimination and refused to answer questions in a subpoenaed 
appearance last month before the house banking committee 
in his suit keating and his attorneys allege that lincoln was 
being operated soundly met federal capital requirements and was 
making a profit and that its takeover by the government was 
capricious and arbitrary 
before hearing testimony sporkin denied efforts by keatings 
attorneys to quash as evidence four letters from one of lincolns 
attorneys prior to the takeover last april 14 
charles m stern a los angeles attorney representing keating 
said allowing the government to use the letters would violate his 
clients attorneyclient privilege we should not be forced to 
have our own lawyers used against us he said 
however attorneys for the thrift regulators said the letters 
effectively became government property once the government seized 
lincoln 
sporkin granted keatings request for government records dating 
back to 1985 on taxsharing agreements between hundreds of thrifts 
around the country and their holding companies 
a key element of the governments case is its contention that 
lincoln and its holding company american continental corp of 
phoenix abused a taxsharing agreement to effectively siphon off 
nearly 95 million in federally insured deposits 
keating is chairman of american continental which filed for a 
chapter 11 bankruptcy reorganization one day before the government 
placed lincoln into conservatorship 
government regulators in 1986 had approved the taxsharing 
arrangement under which american was supposed to collect taxes 
from lincoln and forward the money to the internal revenue service 
but murphy said lincoln and american continental fraudulently 
misused the accord to effectively allow the holding company to use 
the tax collections as a nointerest loan from lincoln 
federal thrift regulations prohibit savings and loan 
institutions from lending money to their holding companies 
in a related development sen alan cranstons complaint about a 
leak of information that the fbi was investigating a voter 
registration project operated by his son kim was referred to the 
justice departments office of professional responsiblity 
fbi director william s sessions told reporters he referred the 
matter to the justice departments internal investigations office 
cranston dcalif is one of five senators who intervened on 
keatings behalf with federal regulators 
the fbi is investigating whether whether cranston and the other 
senators violated any laws by taking campaign donations from 
keating and lobbying federal regulators

bells tolled thousands wept in the 
graveyards and plaintive chants filled the streets thursday as 
armenia marked the first anniversary of the earthquake that killed 
25000 of its people 
in this mountain city officials stopped the town clock forever 
at 1141 the minute disaster struck and held a moment of silence 
only muffled sobs broke the stillness 
if only it could all have been a dream and we could wake up 
and have everyone here again armenian poet maro marzarian told a 
crowd of several hundred gathered to dedicate a memorial to 
leninakans thousands of dead 
in a snowy cemetery just outside of town women sobbed at the 
gravesites some of them caressing photographs etched on the 
tombstones and men stood stony eyed and silent many graves held 
unidentified corpses with markers reading only 238 woman or 
453 child 
your soul hurts so much you just cant express it said 
lilia stepanian 25 whose brother zillik and his family were 
crushed to death in their leninakan apartment 
you remember that on this day at this time they were already 
gone she said at this time one year ago i was standing by our 
house only it wasnt a house any more 
she said zilliks 3yearold daughter could be heard crying from 
the ruins of the house but rescuers could not get to her in time 
stepanians mother rima said zilliks wife had been due to give 
birth to a second child three weeks later 
and the people left alive have such a hard time lilia 
stepanian said she and her mother moved to armenian capital of 
yerevan until leninakan housing could be built for them which 
they dont expect any time soon 
the earthquake measuring 69 on the richter scale killed at 
least 25000 people left 20000 missing and destroyed the homes of 
500000 more 
in the nearby village of spitak where the quake destroyed 
virtually every house residents dedicated a new church of 
galvanized steel standing above a hillside crowded with graves it 
shone in the sun under thursdays bright blue sky 
armenians stopped work thursday to honor the dead and armenian 
tv broadcast a program on earthquake damage and reconstruction 
after the quake rocked armenia with such devastating force the 
soviet union opened its borders to foreign assistance for the first 
time accepting the help of thousands of experts including rescue 
teams doctors and construction specialists 
more than a halfbillion dollars in assistance poured into the 
disaster area from overseas altering the course of eastwest 
relations as generosity and mercy overcame years of soviet 
propaganda depicting westerners as greedy and hatefilled 
foreign ministry spokesman gennady gerasimov said thursday that 
foreign assistance as of midoctober totaled 586 million the most 
generous donors were italy with 95 million west germany with 
845 million the united states with 42 million britain with 38 
million czechoslovakia with 345 million east germany with 30 
million and france with 28 million 
on thursday the vatican announced pope john paul ii sent 
100000 to armenian christians saying he wanted to give a new 
sign of his affection for those peoples and of his active 
participation in the difficult test they have been subjected to 
vatican officials gave the gift to vasken i the chief leader of 
the armenian church which broke from the roman catholic church in 
the 6th century but maintains good ties with the holy see

president fw de klerk said 
friday he would not order an independent inquiry into allegations 
of police death squads because justice officials could do the job 
faster and just as well 
several police officers serving and retired will be 
investigated and five have requested suspension from duty until 
investigations or legal proceedings are completed de klerk and 
adriaan vlok the law and order minister said in statements 
released at 1201 am 
justice minister kobie coetsee said two former security 
policemen whose allegations prompted the inquiry would be 
prosecuted one awaits execution for a nonpolitical murder and the 
other has fled the country 
the government has full confidence that the tried and 
respected prosecution mechanisms of the state will be sufficient to 
bring the accused before the court impartially and objectively 
de klerk in response to demands that the investigation be conducted 
outside the law enforcement establishment 
a judicial inquiry can take months if not years to reach its 
final conclusions he said in the meanwhile a climate of 
suspicion and distrust could develop something the country can ill 
afford at this stage in its history 
south africas national police have been criticized for failing 
to solve dozens of killings of antigovernment activists since 
1978 antiapartheid leaders say many people believe security 
personnel help plan participate in or cover up such actions 
three former security policemen have said in recent newspaper 
interviews or sworn affidavits that they participated in death 
squad operations on orders of superiors many of whom still occupy 
high positions in the police 
the former policemen two black and one white said they were 
involved in bombings arson kidnapping robbery and murder in 
south africa and neighboring countries 
one almond nofomela is awaiting execution the others have

transportation secretary samuel skinner 
assured private transportation operators thursday that his 
department will be reasonable and understanding in enforcing 
drug testing rules that take effect this month 
you dont have to be worried during the implementation stage 
that enforcers will show up at your doorstep with subpoenas 
skinner told an industry seminar on the new program 
drug testing programs including random testing will have to go 
into effect for mariners and transit and aviation workers this 
month testing for railroad workers starts in january and for 
pipeline workers in april a federal court injunction has stalled 
random and some postaccident testing in the trucking industry 
companies with fewer than 50 employees will have another year to 
begin testing programs twentytwo court challenges have been filed 
against the program by various transportation groups but skinner 
said it will take effect on schedule except where courts intervene 
while we want the rules enforced and expect them to be 
implemented we understand it will be an evolutionary process 
skinner said rest assured we will be reasonable and 
understanding 
skinner said safetyrelated jobs must be drugfree for the 
nations transportation systems to remain safe the department 
eventually expects about half of the nations 4 million 
transportation employees to be tested at least once a year both as 
a means of detecting drug use and as a deterent 
skinner noted that 25349 random drug tests conducted on 
department employees resulted in only 141 positive tests a rate of 
about 05 percent but he told reporters earlier this week that he 
expects the tests to show an alarming amount of drug usage in 
mass transit and other private transportation industries

police and community leaders expected little 
violent reaction thursday to the guilty verdicts against a police 
officer in the killing of two black men but police stayed on alert 
in the ethnically tense city 
police had made extraordinary preparations in case an inocent 
verdict in the trial of hispanic officer william lozano set off 
violence in black neighborhoods instead the verdict left 
bitterness among some hispanics 
well maintain a high visibility tonight and possibly 
downscale our activities tomorrow police chief perry anderson 
said 
the police department put all 1100 officers on call bought 700 
gas masks and arranged for two armored personnel carriers to be 
available for riot duty 
the city has been wracked by riots four times this decade most 
recently in january when lozanos fatal shooting of a black 
motorcyclist triggered three days of violence in the week before 
miami held the super bowl the motorcyclists passenger also died 
near the shooting site in the impoverished mostly black 
overtown section some 100 blacks went ahead with a march thursday 
despite the verdict but they said the event was turned from a 
protest to a celebration 
the verdict means relief but theres still an element in the 
police department that thinks justice lies at the end of your 
arm said march organizer michael umoja imani 
everyone has been following this from day one said 
participant judy wallace 22 who lives in an apartment building 
across the street from the shooting site when the verdict was 
announced everyone was relieved and very happy 
some marchers criticized police officials decision to post 
riotready units in black neighborhoods and ignore mostly hispanic 
areas 
among hispanics who outnumber dade county blacks more than 
2to1 the mood seemed mostly concerned but not hostile 
yes there will be people in the hispanic community that will 
think its unfair but that has to be settled said tere gavalda 
of the spanishamerican league against discrimination its 
unfortunate the case turned out to be a black against hispanic 
issue we have to put that to rest 
mayor xavier suarez said he received nearly a dozen telephone 
calls from people angered by the verdict but there was no 
indication of violence 
suarez who last summer was denounced by some fellow 
cubanamericans for supporting a black woman over a cuban for a 
city commission seat said there was no way of knowing if the 
verdict would raise tensions between blacks and hispanics 
i dont think the hispanic community is going to respond in 
any monolithic way suarez said 
suarez who took office in 1985 with a promise to improve 
miamis innercity neighborhoods hoped the verdict might ease some 
of the alienation among blacks there who feel the justice system is 
against them 
there has been a succession of cases that led to outcomes that 
have not been successful to the black community suarez said 
this was at least a departure from a trend 
community leaders who had been ready to go into the streets to 
talk against violence said they would try to ease any ethnic 
reactions by hispanics 
we definitely have not reached utopia said willie sims of 
the dade county community relations board were not going to 
drop everything we were focusing on a not guilty verdict and 
black reaction and now the emphasis shifts on the hispanic group 
at spanishlanguage radio station wqba caller were shocked and 
angry said fernando checa a technical director mostly they 
feel the judgment was done for the black community checa said 
some police advocates predicted the verdict would harm efforts 
to recruit for miamis police force 
i hope this wont discourage people from being police 
officers but thats my concern being a cop in miami is tough 
enough said david nevel attorney for a police group that 
supports stronger penalties for criminals and also president of 
miami beach fraternal order of police associates

elections 
lt gen wolfgang schwanitz chief of state security said angry 
citizens had stormed secret police facilities in four cities 
inflicting numerous slight injuries to our colleagues

consequences for the country

cases have been documented opposition leaders in suhl claimed

in an interview on state television communist premier hans 
modrow appealed for calm while sympathizing with people angered by 
reports of ousted officials thwarting investigations of alleged 
corruption

strikes occurring at state enterprises the west german newspaper

both sides

increasing aggression in east germany hansjochen vogel leader 
of the opposition social democrats expressed similar concern 
in what may have been intended as a preventative measure the 
east berlin secret police force invited activists from several 
prodemocracy groups for a tour of their headquarters and talks 
with security officials 
east germany has undergone a virtual revolution in less than two 
months ousting the old leaders then the replacements and opening 
its borders some former leaders have been charged with corruption 
as in the the rest of eastern europe at a time of rapid change 
the future political course is unclear

program 
many topics raised at the first partyopposition meeting 
thursday also are likely to be addressed at the communist party 
congress

the presidential guard used tear 
gas and clubs to disperse about 1000 students thursday during the 
largest protest yet against european mercenaries who seized control 
of this island nation 
witnesses said several of the highschool students were beaten 
the violence came as france cut off its 18 million in annual 
aid to the comoros off the east coast of africa diplomatic 
sources said the assistance would not be resumed until the head of 
the new ruling group french mercenary bob denard leaves the 
island 
south africa another large donor to this impoverished nation 
with a population of about 430000 took the same action monday it 
also cut off support for the presidential guard 
president ahmed abdallah abderrahmane died nov 26 in an attack 
blamed by diplomatic sources on denard commander of the 500member 
presidential guard that force disarmed the regular army and now 
controls the fourisland archipelago between mozambique and the 
island of madagascar 
the students shouted the mercenaries must go and denard 
is an assassin as they marched from the french embassy to the 
beachfront thursday morning 
they were confronted there by members of the guard which is led 
by about 30 french and belgian mercenaries 
the guardsmen supported by jeeps equipped with heavy machine 
guns drove through the capital in the biggest show of force since 
abdallah was killed denard has denied involvement in the 
assassination but sources said thursday the two men had quarreled 
recently over several issues including funding of the presidential 
guard 
many students dashed into the water when the guardsmen arrived 
and others fled through side streets most later regrouped at the 
ministry of the interior in the city center where dozens of 
guardsmen launched teargas grenades and charged with clubs 
youths forced a suspected spy for the presidential guard from 
his civilian car then overturned the vehicle and burned it on one 
of the main streets of moroni the capital 
witnesses said several students were clubbed or otherwise 
beaten but there was no official injury toll 
guardsmen patrolled workingclass areas of the city throughout 
the day dispersing smaller gatherings with tear gas and clubs the 
witnesses said 
throughout the day hundreds of young men jeered and shouted at 
guard vehicles as they sped through the capital and outlying 
villages 
the people have always opposed the mercenaries but they were 
silent until the president was killed said abdul mohammed a 
moroni resident now the people are angry and say the mercenaries 
must leave 
several photographers and reporters had their film and notebooks 
seized as they covered the morning demonstration ten journalists 
were later ordered to leave the islands by thursday evening and 
five other journalists were told to remain in their hotel 
the french foreign ministry said the suspended aid includes 
direct assistance as well as 150 technical and 13 military 
advisers the islands gained independence from france in 1975 
denard 60 ousted and later returned abdallah to the presidency

colombia descended into political chaos 
thursday under threats from drug traffickers of further terrorism 
leading one newspaper to demand cancellation of next years 
presidential elections 
all 10 presidential candidates for party nomination should 
withdraw the influential el espectador newspaper said in an 
editorial 
the capitals halfdozen dailies all ran banner headlines about 
wednesdays 1100pound dynamite bomb explosion that destroyed a 
block of downtown bogota killing 52 people and wounding about 
1000 
the blast outside federal investigative police headquarters came 
one day after a government report blamed terrorists for the nov 27 
explosion of a colombian jet that killed all 107 people aboard 
drug traffickers turn bogota into beirut said el tiempos 
headline 
el tiempo and el espectador said the situation was so grave 
president virgilio barco should ask all parties to forget their 
differences and form a common front against traffickers 
el espectador said the crisis extends beyond the traffickers 
terrorist campaign to encompass a political system on the verge of 
collapse 
barco told the nation late wednesday traffickers were 
endangering the countrys democracy but would fail 
we are fighting and will continue to fight the war is against 
all colombia against democracy he said in a speech transmitted 
by satellite from tokyo where he is on a state visit 
barco is cutting his visit short by one day and returning to 
colombia friday night 
in tokyo on thursday the president promised to take swift 
stern action against cocaine cartels and the terrorists 
us house speaker thomas foley cited the drug violence thursday 
in washington when he said president bush ought to think 
carefully about a visit to colombia under these circumstances he 
commented after meeting with bush at the white house on the malta 
summit 
white house advance teams have scouted colombias northern 
coastal city of cartagena as a possible site for the upcoming drug 
summit bush has agreed to attend with leaders of colombia bolivia 
and peru 
meanwhile a bomb exploded thursday on a road in cartagena 
killing two policemen in a car radio reports said pamphlets left 
at the site however indicated the attack was the work of the 
leftist guerrilla national liberation army 
the immediate threat to this south american nations stability 
is traffickers insistence that the people be allowed to vote on 
the administrations extradition policy 
the extraditables a group linked to the medellin cocaine 
cartel took responsibility for the wednesday bomb hours after the 
devastating explosion it earlier pledged in a communique to keep 
up the terrorist campaign until the extradition referendum is 
approved by congress 
colombias house of representatives passed a bill tuesday night 
calling for such a referendum and the senate is to vote on the 
measure before its current session ends on dec 15 
congress has long been the butt of jokes by colombians as being 
corrupt and receiving payments from drug dealers 
in an editorial headlined faced with crime terror and moral 
corruption el espectador said the countrys constitutional 
system no longer exists because it has been so damaged by 
traffickers influence 
traffickers bombed el espectador on sept 2 as part of a terror 
campaign to try to pressure the government into ending extradition 
barco suggested in his speech that drug barons were intimidating 
legislators into following their demands 
it is unacceptable from every point of view that drug 
traffickers are trying to subdue our legislators so that they make 
a decision that will only bring more death and destruction he 
said 
his administration has sent nine colombian drug suspects to the 
united states under a tough extradition policy part of an 
antinarcotics war decreed last august after traffickers 
assassinated a leading presidential candidate

a us appeals court has upheld a federal judges 
1987 ruling that boston university must pay 215000 in damages and 
grant tenure to a female professor who sued the university for sex 
discrimination 
the case was believed to be the first time a woman suing under 
the federal antidiscrimination law was reinstated with full tenure 
by an appeals court 
julia prewitt brown 41 was a member of bus english department 
from 1974 until she was denied tenure in 1981 at one point 
university president john silber termed the department a damn 
matriarchy although only only six out of 20 members of the 
department at the time were female according to court testimony 
in a 68page decision the 1st circuit court of appeals 
unanimously agreed with a jury verdict and subsequent judgment by 
judge walter j skinner after a threeweek trial in july 1987 the 
ruling was issued dec 1 but browns attorney said she chose not to 
publicize it until thursday 
bu spokesman thomas cashman said the university will ask the 
court for a rehearing 
boston university does not discriminate against anyone 
cashman said in a prepared statement this case involves issues 
of academic freedom we believe that it is wrong for courts to 
substitute their opinions or the opinions of the jury for the 
scholarly judgment of the university in determining who shall 
teach 
bus official reason for not granting tenure was browns alleged 
lack of academic excellence but brown was unanimously 
recommended for tenure by her bu colleagues both inside and outside 
the department according to the appellate decision 
i think its going to be a real shot in the arm for women as 
well as minorities said barbara lee an attorney on the faculty 
at rutgers university and the author of academics in court 
its extremely difficult to win these cases she said 
most times the judge accepts the universities arguments 
the decision written by chief judge levin campbell touched on 
remarks made by silber in tenure reviews of other female faculty 
members 
according to the ruling silber told one female professor that a 
person with her credentials would do well and anyway your 
husband is a parachute so why are you worried 
campbell wrote that silbers comments reflected a 
patronizing attitude toward women 
brown who spent 10 years fighting her case called the decision 
a victory for all of us 
i am only one among many women at boston university and in the 
academy at large who have been held to a higher standard than male 
colleagues she said in a prepared statement thursday 
ann h franke an attorney with the american association of 
university professors who filed a friendofthecourt brief in the 
appellate court said the ruling means theres a powerful remedy 
through the courts now for sex discrimination 
franke and lee both said the appeals decision was the first to 
their knowledge in which a professors full tenure was reinstated 
under the antidiscrimination law

sixteen savings and loans were permitted to 
sell 3 billion in uninsured debt to their customers the same 
practice that cost many depositors at lincoln savings and loan 
association their life savings thrift regulators said thursday 
despite the lincoln debacle the office of thrift supervision 
this year allowed seven sampls to begin selling debt to retail 
customers and another nine institutions to continue sales approved 
earlier according to a twopage summary released by the office 
such sales are attracting heavy scrutiny because some 22000 
investors many of them elderly pensioners and widows lost an 
estimated 250 million by purchasing subordinated debt in american 
continental corp the parent company of the irvine califbased 
lincoln in 1987 and 1988 
in sometimes tearful testimony lincoln customers told the house 
banking committee last month they were misled into believing the 
debt certificates were federally insured 
the lincoln debt was sold in the branch offices of the sampl and 
offered in amounts as small as 1000 a feature that appealed to 
unsophisticated investors 
the thrift office said the approved debt sales in addition to 
lincoln totaled 3017 billion in some instances denominations as 
low as 1000 were offered 
thrift office rules required that sampls offering debt meet 
capital standards at the time of the approval however according 
to sheshunoff information services of austin texas two of the 16 
sampls as of june 30 had no tangible capital they are security first 
federal savings and loan assocation of daytona beach fla and 
centrust savings bank miami 
two others fall short of new standards effective thursday which 
require sampls to hold capital amounting to 15 percent of their 
assets the firm said they are cenlar federal savings bank 
princeton nj and tcf bank savings minneapolis 
centrust was allowed to offer 50 million in notes in minimum 
denominations of 2000 while cenlar was permitted 20 million in 
1000 denominations tcf and security first sold their debt in 
minimums of 10000 
however not all of the debt sales are suspect alex sheshunoff 
the owner of the information firm said the 1 billion offering in 
100000 minimums by world savings and loan association oakland 
calif considered one of the best sampls in the nation is probably 
an excellent investment 
sheshunoff said sampls should be permitted to offer their debt 
without going through an underwriter but he said they should 
screen out unsophisticated buyers by offering the debt in large 
denominations and should clearly disclose that the debt is 
uninsured 
the release of the information by the thrift office which 
followed a story on the subject in thursday editions of the 
washington post drew criticism of the sales from a house banking 
subcommittee chairman 
rep frank annunzio dill chairman of the financial 
institutions panel called on wall in a letter to revoke his 
agencys permission for the debt sales 
there is no need for me to recite the damage that this kind of 
sale caused to thousands of purchasers in the lincoln 
situation annunzio wrote 
wall in a talk to the association of government accountants 
said his agency was obligated to approve the debt sales under 
existing laws and rules 
there was no regulation that had been promulgated to prohibit 
it so we could not have disapproved it other than for good and 
other kinds of economic reasons he said 
the thrift agency is planning within weeks to adopt regulations 
sharply limiting future subordinated debt sales by sampls because 
weve learned from our experiences wall said 
bills restricting the sale of sampl debt have been introduced in 
the house by reps charles schumer dny and thomas mcmillen

vaclav havel who only a month ago 
was reviled by the official press said thursday he would accept 
the presidency if necessary to help resolve the countrys crisis 
appearing at a crowded news conference in the laterna magika 
theater the playwright seemed tired but elated by his speedy 
transfer from the dramatic to the political stage 
thousands of supporters of czechoslovakias civic forum 
opposition movement which havel heads are now sporting 
hungarianmade buttons declaring havel for president 
with characteristic humor havel told reporters i dont wear 
that badge he said he had nothing to do with its manufacture 
because my connections do not extend as far as hungary 
a shy man he has repeatedly declined offers to seek political 
office but when asked thursday if he would accept the presidency 
if offered he said he would do so under certain circumstances 
i have repeatedly said that my occupation is a writer and that 
i have no political ambitions i dont feel myself to be a 
professional politician but have always put the public interest 
ahead of my own 
and if god help us the situation should develop in such a 
way that the only service i could render my country would be to do 
this then of course i would do it havel said 
he stressed that there is no organized group promoting his 
candidacy 
the more democratic and more normal the condition in our 
country the less my role will be the mustachioed writer said 
havel has avoided interviews the past two hectic weeks during a 
mass prodemocracy movement that forced the communists to 
relinquish their 41year monopoly on power ousted most hardline

in a defeat for organized labor a federal 
judge ruled thursday in favor of a labor department regulation that 
allows working at home in five apparelrelated industries 
us district court judge gerhard gesells ruling rescinds a ban 
on home work in the five industries he said the justice department 
regulation represents a reasoned approach requiring firms 
seeking to institute home work to come forward and seek 
certification from the government they also would be subjected to 
monitoring by department inspectors 
the international ladies garment workers union and two other 
unions sued the secretary of labor last january saying tens of 
thousands of workers mostly immigrant women would be exploited by 
the rule and that the working standards of other workers would be 
threatened 
the five industries affected by the department rule are those 
making gloves and mittens handkerchiefs buttons and buckles some 
types of jewelry and embroideries the department this past year 
held several public hearings on its proposed rule and has yet to 
issue a final version 
gesell said the concerns of labor unions about workers being 
exploited by home work are no doubt valid a ban on home work 
in seven industries including the five affected by the department 
rule was adopted by the labor department in the early 1940s home 
workers in those industries are normally paid by piece rate rather 
than hourly wages 
the evidence is strong that the conditions present in the 
1940s regarding the exploitation of home workers have not 
disappeared said gesell 
but the judge said the sole issue before the court is 
whether the labor department provided a reasoned basis for 
concluding that a certification system is a better means of 
enforcing federal labor law than a total home work ban 
he said the department formulated the rule after nearly a decade 
of analysis 
the aflcio is deeply disappointed by the court decision 
said lorrie mchugh a spokeswoman for the 141millionmember labor 
federation removing the ban on home work opens up new doors to 
exploitation of workers doors that were closed over 40 years ago 
because abuse ran rampant 
labor secretary elizabeth dole said in a statement she was most 
pleased the departments rule she said is a step in the right 
direction toward reconciling some of the demands of work and 
family 
the labor unions contend the rule contains inadequate safeguards 
to prevent violations of laws governing minimum wage child labor 
maximum work hours workplace safety and other issues 
the rule may well encourage home workers and their employers 
to come forward and comply with the fair labor standards act 
said the judge 
gesell said states that disagree with the departments 
conclusion remain free to ban home work in those industries 
the unions have pointed to evidence that the department has 
failed to vigorously enforce the total home work ban the 
department attributes that to scarce resources and maintains that a 
certification system would be superior to a total home work ban 
gesell questioned the possible motives of both sides saying 
that the departments decision to lift the ban may be motivated by 
its sympathy for certain constituences or a certain political 
philosophy he said the unions may be motivated by concerns of 
its members about the threat of economic competition from home 
workers and firms employing them 
but gesell said his role is not to referee this dispute or to 
speculate on how it has shaded the debate between the unions and 
the government

the government on thursday allowed for the 
possibility of a reunified germany but said such a state must be 
formed gradually and respect polands borders 
in the solidarity governments first definitive statement on the 
issue foreign minister krzysztof skubiszewski told parliament the 
two german states could be joined as part of the process of uniting 
europe 
he said german reunification cannot go ahead of the 
reunification of europe 
a reunited germany will not be created tomorrow or the day 
after tomorrow skubiszewski said fears and concerns appearing 
every now and then including in poland are unjustified although 
alertness is recommended 
asked about german reunification at a news conference in gdansk 
solidarity labor leader lech walesa said he prefers no political 
changes in europe but there should be all kinds of economic 
integrations 
western european countries have agreed to form an economic union 
by the end of 1992 
sweeping democratic reforms have taken hold in east germany in 
the past several weeks under the pressure of mass protests 
spurring talk of reuniting the two german states divided at the end 
of world war ii west germany has proposed a plan for greater 
unity but east german leaders reject reunification 
the specter of a powerful reunited germany has troubed many 
poles especially the older ones who recall the 1939 nazi invasion 
of poland that began world war ii 
a reported surge in antipolish sentiment in east germany in 
recent weeks has heightened polish anxieties 
skubiszewskis speech seemed designed to reassure poles that the 
government does not see unification in the near future and will 
insist on polands current borders 
skubiszewski faulted west german chancellor helmut kohls 
program for gradual german reunification offered last week for 
not making clear that reunification would respect the existing 
border between poland and east germany 
some rightwing west german politicians have called for 
recovering the 40000 square miles of territory that germany lost 
to poland at the end of world war ii the territory is about 
onethird of presentday poland 
east germany and west germany each separately has recognized the 
border but there has been no official assurance that a reunified 
germany would also acknowledge the border 
one can only unite within established borders and without 
territorial arguments said skubiszewski 
he also said german reunification is unlikely as long as west 
germany belongs to nato and east germany to the sovietled warsaw 
pact military alliance

richard miller the only fbi agent ever 
convicted of espionage said thursday his affair with a soviet 
woman was the stupidest thing ive done in my life but declared 
he never was a spy 
i love my country miller said im a patriotic kind of 
guy i know in my heart im not a traitor 
the 52yearold miller was released from prison last month after 
his conviction was overturned on appeal while awaiting a third 
trial he agreed to be interviewed by a group of reporters 
in the wideranging twohour interview the portly former agent 
was alternately serious and wisecracking as he discussed his five 
years in prison his lackluster 20year career with the fbi his 
extramarital affair with svetlana ogorodnikov and his devout return 
to the teachings of his mormon faith 
i am absolutely innocent of any and all of the charges the 
government put before me he said specifically that i never 
gave that young lady any kind of document and that is the truth of 
the matter 
millers lawyers stanley greenberg and joel levine stood by to 
veto questions on the exact facts of the case but he eagerly 
answered most queries 
miller was convicted of trading a secret fbi reporting guide for 
money sex and gold his attorneys claimed he was no spy but a 
bumbler who was trying to redeem his lackluster career by 
infiltrating the kgb through mrs ogorodnikov a soviet emigre 
asked during the interview whether he was a good fbi agent he 
said a lot of the time i was a good fbi agent one of the 
exceptions was the stupid idiotic thing i tried to do with 
svetlana it was one of the stupidest things ive done in fact it 
was the stupidest thing ive done in my life 
he added i was not a good fbi agent in the sense that i 
didnt have sense enough to protect myself i try to be an open 
honest person and that honesty and openness was misconstrued as a 
confession 
he declined to blame the fbi for his problems i still have in 
my heart some loyalty to the fbi he said later adding i do 
feel ive been mistreated by a handful of people in the fbi 
but he insisted i dont have any bitter feelings against 
anybody 
after two trials miller was convicted in 1986 of passing 
secrets to mrs ogorodnikov and her husband nickolay his first 
trial ended with a deadlocked jury the ogorodnikovs pleaded guilty 
to conspiracy to commit espionage and are serving prison terms 
in april the 9th us circuit court of appeals overturned 
millers conviction on grounds that the jury should not have been 
told that miller failed lie detector tests 
i feel i didnt get a fair trial said miller i got the 
impression that the prosecution as well as the judge were not so 
much interested in a fair trial or the truth of the matter as to 
get a conviction 
he refers to his upcoming trial in may as miller three it 
makes me feel like rambo 
he conceded that his sexual indiscretions with mrs ogorodnikov 
and other women brought on his career downfall and the end of his 
marriage 
i probably have more guilt over that than any single thing 
he said ive always tried to be a very moral person and having 
five affairs in two years is not very moral i guess i got 
caught up in the sexual revolution of the 80s it could have 
partially been midlife crisis 
miller was excommunicated by the mormon church for his 
extramarital affairs but he said his faith is stronger now than 
ever and it helped him endure five years in federal prison which he 
called devastating

a math teacher who was fired for 
refusing to wear a necktie will return to the classroom next week 
school officials said thursday 
ill be wearing a good pair of jeans a cotton denim shirt and 
my boots bill webb said thursday 
for most of his 20 years in teaching webb has worn jeans and a 
work shirt the school board instituted a new dress code during the 
198889 school year calling for a tie and dress pants 
webb refused saying he had signed his contract before the dress 
code was in effect he also contended that the school board 
shouldnt be able to regulate a teachers choice of clothes 
webb was suspended several times and then dismissed in december 
of 1988 for refusing to conform 
the reinstatement came after the state supreme court said webb 
had to be given his job back while the mason county board of 
education appeals a lowercourt decision that overturned the firing 
rick powell mason county superintendent of schools said the 
reinstatement wont halt the boards appeal to the state supreme 
court 
one way or another whether mr webb prevails or we prevail 
my goal is to get the system back to normalcy powell said 
and the system is about educating young people 
webb predicts it will take some time to get back into the swing 
of things 
i think it will be a little awkward both for me and the 
students he said theyve had a different teacher this year 
its unfortunate that theyve had to go this type of thing for 
two years in a row 
the board is to meet with webb on friday powell said attorneys 
for the board and webb are to discuss back pay which webb contends 
he is owed for his time off the job 
since his firing webb has been farming at his home in 
gallipolis ohio and running an auto body shop gallipolis is just 
across the ohio river from point pleasant about 50 miles northwest 
of charleston

the general assembly voted overwhelmingly 
in favor of a resolution thursday that calls on the united states 
to stop financing nicaraguas contra rebels 
the assembly passed by a 912 margin the nicaraguansponsored 
resolution against the usbacked contras who were to be disbanded 
this week under a regional peace plan it asked washington to obey 
a 1986 judgment by the international court of justice ordering it 
to halt support for the contras 
only the united states and israel voted against the measure the 
41 abstentions included most of the us allies in europe and the 
caribbean honduras where an estimated 11000 contra forces are 
headquartered in jungle camps along the nicaraguan border also 
abstained 
in a separate action the general assembly decided by consensus 
to approve spending up to 408 million over six months to send a 
650member border patrol force to central america 
the peacekeeping force is intended to deter crossborder raids 
by the contras or any other insurgents and to cut off 
weaponssmuggling 
the united states accuses nicaragua and cuba of shipping weapons 
to leftist rebels battling el salvadors government and the 
contras have acknowledged they are selling weapons to the 
salvadoran rebels 
us ambassador thomas r pickering told the assembly that the 
world courts ruling was onesided ignoring us support for the 
central american peace process 
the united states had said it not believe the world court based 
in the netherlands and serving as the uns judicial arm could 
rule on national security issues 
the courts 15 judges ruled washington had disobeyed 
international law by interfering in nicaraguas internal affairs 
with its support for the contras the court has no power to enforce 
its judgments however 
us military aid to the contras ended two years ago pickering 
said and only nonlethal aid is sent to the rebels 
by contrast he said nicaraguas military assistance to the 
el salvador insurgents has again been revealed in the recent plane 
crash at el transito in el salvador which revealed weapons 
destined for the el salvador guerrillas 
two dozen sovietmade sam7 antiaircraft missile launchers were 
found in the wreckage of that light plane which crashed nov 25 
nicaraguan ambassador alejandro serrano caldera said us 
aggression against nicaragua continues today he said us 
nonlethal aid to the contras is actually logistical help in the 
war 
in addition serrano caldera said us meddling in nicaraguas 
internal affairs continued when the us congress appropriated 9 
million for the opposition in national elections set for feb 25 
under an agreement signed by central american presidents the 
contras were to be dismantled voluntarily by last tuesday however 
neither the rebels nor the united states were part of that accord 
president daniel ortega of nicaragua has proposed extending the 
deadline to the end of the month the regions presidents are 
meeting again sunday in costa rica to take up the issue

the speaker of the house thomas s foley 
said thursday that improvements in ussoviet relations make cuts 
in the pentagons budget inevitable 
foleys comment came as he and other congressional leaders 
praised president bushs actions at last weekends meeting with 
soviet president mikhail s gorbachev in malta 
bush briefed lawmakers on his talks with gorbachev and on events 
in eastern europe and the philippines 
sen patrick leahy dvt said afterward that bush probably 
heard the most praise hell hear from democrats in a long time 
were all proud of the fact he did a very good job in malta 
foley called bushs actions at malta wise 
as for the defense budget the speaker said he does not 
anticipate a huge immediate peace dividend from the 
lessening of eastwest tensions but undoubtedly the defense 
budget is going to go in a downward course relative to the gross 
national product and relative to government expenditure said 
foley 
congress expects that and i think its inevitable foley 
said 
the united states for 40 years has faced a strategic situation 
in which the soviet union posed a threat as we saw it to the 
security of western europe and to us interests around the 
world he said that hasnt totally disappeared but it has 
been so largely altered by events of recent months and the last 
couple of years that to maintain a defense posture based on 
that would be foolish 
the associated press learned thursday that bush has decided to 
seek a 292 billion defense budget next year this years pentagon 
budget is 286 million a 6 billion increase would not keep pace 
with inflation 
sen claiborne pell dri chairman of the senate foreign 
relations committee said the president did an excellent job in 
converting what was just goiing to be a meeting a rendezvous into 
an actual summit with substantive discussions 
leahy said bush and gorbachev should meet every year with or 
without an agenda just as the president meets annually in an 
economic summit with leaders of the seven major industrialized 
democracies

president bush voiced strong nostrings support 
thursday for philippine president corazon aquino but congressional 
leaders expressed concern about the depth of opposition to her 
during a speech at a political fundraiser the president 
departed from his text to praise mrs aquino 
just last week democracy was challenged in the philippines 
bush said and we stood with president aquino and we continue to 
stand with her and with democracy now we must not let the 
democratic process be overthrown by revolution and by military 
takeover 
earlier press secretary marlin fitzwater traveling with the 
president on a threestate trip to underline antidrug efforts and 
boost republican candidates said the administration also has 
concerns about mrs aquino and certain of her governments policies 
but that does not diminish the fact that we support her and 
her government and we hope theyre successful we support her 
government without reservations and do not put strings on that 
support fitzwater said 
he was asked about comments the day before by a senior 
administration official suggesting that mrs aquinos political 
future was in doubt and that she should be more attentive to 
eliminating sources of discontent in her country 
there are a lot of people who are willing to speculate to that 
effect in private but on the record we would not speculate on 
that shes a democratically elected leader and we want her to 
succeed fitzwater told reporters 
leases on the two us bases in the philippines clark air base 
and the subic bay naval installation expire in 1991 
before leaving washington bush met at the white house with 
several congressional leaders who commented afterward 
house speaker thomas s foley said it appears that the 
immediate threat to mrs aquinos government has been removed but 
its troubling that some of the rebel military elements are among 
the most professional and proficient philippine military 
another democrat sen patrick leahy of vermont said the coup 
attempt raised concerns about us aid for the philippines 
especially regarding the future of the us bases there 
were obviously concerned about what that moneys going to be 
spent on what the governments going to be there said leahy 
sen alan simpson rwyo said the coup effort was the 
strongest so far and our intelligence shows us if they keep 
stepping it up grade by grade she will be in deep trouble 
at the state department spokesman richard boucher set a more 
optimistic tone saying the aquino government has shown 
incredible resilience in this situation 
us officials expect that the philippine people can pull 
together under president aquinos leadership he said 
in houston bush concentrated on the antidrug fight standing 
in a park once overrun by drug dealers and likening domestic 
battles against addiction and crime to the struggles for freedom 
sweeping eastern europe 
as with the new freedom in eastern europe freedom from drugs 
isnt something the government can give you youve got to take a 
stand youve got to take back the streets and thats exactly what 
you did right here bush said 
he spoke to a civic association at winzer park and praised the 
community for driving drug dealers out of the park 
in recent years the dream on main street became the nightmare 
on elm street bush said 
one thousand people swept into the park one thousand people 
swept the drug dealers out they havent come back bush said 
you were united you were determined you were angry and you were 
right 
on the trip fitzwater also was asked about the senior 
officials comments on soviet president mikhail s gorbachev the 
official who spoke on condition of anonymity called gorbachevs 
economic views simplistic and said he displayed a lack of 
sophistication in his meeting at malta last weekend with bush 
fitzwater said the official should probably have not used the 
word simplistic and that we wouldnt use that word at the same 
time fitzwater said there is a lack of knowledge on 
gorbachevs part about how free enterprise systems work and how 
market economies work 
later bush told a republican fundraising dinner for sen phil 
gramm of texas that his summit last week with gorbachev was a 
success a chance to improve an important relationship 
tensions have been reduced but there was one area where i had 
to speak firmly and frankly and that was on central america there 
can be no misunderstanding here bush said bush has repeatedly 
accused the soviets allies in central america cuba and nicaragua 
of funneling east blocbuilt arms to the rebels in el salvador 
republican national committee chairman lee atwater who flew 
aboard air force one with bush said that the event was expected to 
yield 28 million which he said would make it the biggest 
political fundraiser in history 
fitzwater said bush decided to mix antidrug speeches with gop 
fundraising appearances here and then on friday in denver to 
dramatize the efforts of the president in that area and keep the 
momentum going 
conducting such official business also will reduce the 
percentage of the cost of the trip that must be picked up by the 
republican national committee 
bush who claims houston as his voting residence told his 
wenzer park audience its always great to be back in texas and 
especially after that little storm in malta its great to be back 
on dry land 
the talks in malta remind us all that we live in dramatic and 
exciting times bush said under overcast skies 
thats true not only in eastern europe where people are 
seeking freedom to travel and freedom to vote but right here in 
the usa where brave men and women have used people power to 
fight for another kind of freedom freedom from fear freedom from 
crime freedom from drugs

a hispanic policeman was found guilty of 
manslaughter thursday in the deaths of two black men and black 
leaders praised the verdict as a just response to the shooting that 
set off three days of racial violence 
miami officer william lozano 31 showed no emotion when he 
heard the verdict in the jan 16 deaths of motorcyclist clement 
lloyd 23 and passenger allan blanchard 24 the two counts carry 
a total maximum sentence of 45 years 
circuit judge joseph farina deferred adjudication on the jurys 
findings an administrative formality to allow a presentencing 
investigation he ordered everyone involved to return to court jan 
24 lozano remained free on 10000 bond and had to surrender his 
passport 
the televised verdict by the sixmember multiethnic jury 
brought relief to an innercity black community that feared the 
trial would spark another round of racial unrest 
it just shows that our system works if people will give it a 
chance to work and that there are other ways of impacting the 
system than through violence said willie sims a black community 
leader who is a member of dade countys community relations board 
when the verdict was announced people in the overtown 
neighborhood where the shooting took place erupted with cheering 
hornhonking and handslapping men and women broke into impromptu 
solo dances 
by 9 pm the downtown area was calm a report of a man wounded 
in the leg in overtown was possibly drugrelated but not related 
to the trial said miami police spokesman armando villorin 
about 100 blacks who had met at the shooting site for a march on 
the courthouse turned the event into a celebration 
everyone has been following this from day one said judy 
wallace 22 who lives in an apartment building across the street 
from spot of the shooting when the verdict was announced 
everyone was relieved and very happy 
miami has been racked by racial unrest four times this decade 
including riots in 1980 and 1984 sparked by acquittals of police 
charged in the deaths of blacks 
but community leaders praised the presence of two black jurors 
and the almost gaveltogavel live broadcast coverage of the trial 
as reassuring the community the trial would be fair 
we were relieved that justice has been served said george 
lubrin blanchards brotherinlaw 
we are very satisfied that the verdict came back guilty on 
both counts and that the trial itself was very fair said barry 
greff attorney for the lloyd family 
some police were dismayed feeling lozano was defending himself 
most of my members are in shock we all felt william lozano 
was justified said richard kinne head of the fraternal order of 
police which represents most of the citys officers 
asked what the average officer thinks kinne replied hes 
seriously thinking what hes going to do in a lifethreatening 
situation they could become concerned and hesitant out in the 
street 
the jury had deliberated six hours wednesday and reconvened 
thursday deliberating for an additional 1 hours 
defense attorneys and lozanos family did not offer comment but 
left the courtroom quickly his wife in tears 
lozano who remains suspended with full pay talked about his 
case later at his attorneys office 
i was not given a fair trial from the beginning there was a 
lot of evidence denied and quashed he said were going to 
look for a new appeal based on the circumstances he would not 
elaborate 
defense attorney roy black said from the beginning every 
major ruling was against us to even refuse us the right to present 
witnesses is bizarre it was critical for the jury to know the 
motivation of clement lloyd and why he didnt want to stop and why 
he tried to run over this officer the jury got a false impression 
of this case 
prosecutors said lozano fired unnecessarily at lloyd who was 
fleeing a police car after a traffic violation lloyd died of 
gunshot wounds and blanchard died of injuries suffered in the 
resulting crash lozano a native of colombia said he fired in 
selfdefense when the motorcyclist tried to run him down 
the reaction from colombians in miami was immediate 
colombianoriented radio station wocnam received 200 calls in the 
hour after the verdict said afternoon news coordinator fernando 
escobar 
they were unanimous not one call was against lozano people 
were expressing their sadness some were even crying he said 
but he said there was no talk of demonstrations or any violent 
reaction 
the jury returned what we thought was a just verdict it was a 
jury that represents all segments of our society said assistant 
state attorney john hogan the lead prosecutor 
the january riot left one man dead and 11 others wounded 
thirteen buildings were set afire others were looted and 372 
people were arrested 
announcement of thursdays verdict was withheld for about two 
hours while police social workers and community relations 
officials fanned out through the citys black neighborhoods the 
courthouse was even evacuated of nonessential personnel 
tension was high in miami until the verdict was announced 
rumors of a verdict had grown so strong by wednesday afternoon 
that anxious downtown workers reportedly left their jobs early and 
dade county chief circuit judge gerald wetherington went on the air 
to reassure people 
for police there were mixed emotions 
this is a highly charged and emotional time said police 
chief perry anderson its only natural to have personal 
feelings but as a law enforcement agency we have to abide by state 
law 
he said police will continue their vigil 
we dont anticipate problems anderson said we will 
remain on alert well maintain a high visibility tonight and 
possibly downscale our activities tomorrow

insurance companies no longer will be 
allowed to weight their rates on where a driver lives according to 
new state regulations which already are drawing a skeptical 
reaction from consumer groups 
californias insurance commissioner announced a ban tuesday on 
territorial rating a move she said will lower rates for urban 
drivers and raise rates slightly for rural and suburban drivers 
the changes stem from proposition 103 which was approved by 
voters in 1988 and requires auto insurance rates based primarily on 
a drivers safety record experience and miles driven 
the ballot initiative allowed the insurance commissioner to 
specify other factors an insurance company could consider that 
left commissioner roxani gillespie to decide whether to allow 
companies to continue to take a drivers residence into account a 
factor that has led to much higher rates for innercity residents 
the commissioner is promising what we want but her 
regulations may deliver exactly what we dont want and thus may be 
a fraud and an outright violation of proposition 103 said walter 
zelman former executive director of common cause and a candidate 
for the insurance commissioners job when it becomes an elected 
position in 1990 
gillespie who said she will not run for the post next year 
allowed insurers to rely on many other factors that consumer 
advocates said will play the same role as territorial rating those 
factors include repair costs health costs and population density 
she also limited any drivers annual rate increase to the 
percentage rise in the national consumer price index and prohibited 
auto insurance rate discrimination based on sex or marital status 
the net effect will be decreases for urban drivers and small 
increases for rural and suburban gillespie said 
drivers with no more than one moving violation in three years 
will be guaranteed rates at least 20 percent below those of other 
drivers gillespie told reporters 
she said that while a wide range of experts recognize territory 
as a valid rating factor reliance on area of residence under 
her new system would be a little softened from what it is now 
jack murgia of voter revolt sponsor of proposition 103 said 
the regulations are ninety percent of what we wanted the 
outstanding question he said is how great a role a drivers place 
of residence will continue to play in ratesetting 
harry snyder of consumers union said gillespies rules would 
let geographically based rates continue almost unabated 
the regulations take effect within 90 days unless blocked in 
court a freeze on auto insurance rates will continue until the new 
rules are implemented gillespie said

the chairman of continental airlines has 
written to gov cecil andrus and boises mayor apologizing for an 
advertisement run in great britain belittling the city 
the houstonbased airlines also has changed its advertising 
policy to prevent a similar incident continental officials said 
tuesday 
marc johnson andrus press secretary said an apology was the 
least continental chairman frank lorenzo could do lorenzo also is 
chairman of texas air corp continentals parent company 
the governor took exception to a jibe in the ads that asked how 
often someone would need to go to boise andrus called it a cheap 
shot in light of the 1987 denver crash of a boisebound 
continental flight that killed 28 people 14 of them idahoans 
mayor dirk kempthorne said he appreciated the apology but still 
wanted followup advertisements in great britain aimed at boosting 
boises stock as a destination for air travelers 
the advertisement since yanked from publication pitched 
2for1 tickets from london to denver and other destinations the 
ad admitted there are a few places in the united states that 
continental does not serve but asked but be honest how often 
do you really need to go to boise idaho 
continental pulled out of boise and seven other western us 
cities in september 1988 saying it would focus on more profitable 
routes 
lorenzo wrote in the letter to andrus and kempthorne sent by 
fax machine late monday that my view of advertising does not 
include poking fun at any city 
furthermore a copywriter could not have chosen a more 
unsuitable target for his weak pun i was appalled to see the 
effect of these coinciding mistakes lorenzo wrote 
both idaho and continental share many unhappy memories brought 
on by the denver accident i want to continue to do everything 
possible to mend the wounds that resulted from the tragedy he 
wrote 
continental has maintained that the ad prepared by a british 
advertising firm was conceived by people who had no knowledge of 
the denver crash and was not reviewed at corporate headquarters 
until after publication 
art kent continental vice president of corporate communication 
said a new policy has been adopted 
all advertising done overseas has to be approved and cleared 
before publication here at the houston headquarters kent said

cervical cancer risks increase dramatically 
for women who fail to get pap smear tests at least every two years 
university of washington scientists report in a study released 
today 
women who get pap smears only every three years run a risk that 
is 39 times greater that cervical cancer will go undetected than 
women who have the test annually according to the study published 
in the professional journal obstetrics and gynecology 
the study said the risks increase as the betweentest interval 
increases and that for women who have no pap tests for 10 years or 
longer the risk increases by 123 times 
the study shows that women should get pap smears more 
frequently than every three years said dr joseph chu one of 
five physicians who conducted the study at the university of 
washington the risk of having advanced disease goes way down if 
the tests are conducted every two years or less

when ibm announced a multibillion restructuring 
this week it was doing nothing unusual since almost all the 
largest corporations have realigned their forces in this decade 
alone 
it was the third strategy shift in the 1980s for the big 
computer company formally known as international business machines 
corp almost a third of big industrial companies have changed three 
times in the decade and 50 percent twice 
in ibms case it went after high costs with a plan to save 1 
billion a year by eliminating 10000 jobs and consolidating 
manufacturing facilities it sought to support ibm stock with a 
buyback of up to 4 billion in shares 
rather than indicating that companies have lost their way such 
moves illustrate the vast technological strategic financial and 
other forces that are making and remaking marketplaces 
the latest spate of restructurings began in 1986 and is far more 
complex than any that preceded it according to prof eugene 
jennings who has studied corporate changes for 35 years and 
advised executives on how to handle them 
in strategic planning today he says four elements serve as a 
planning matrix two of them market forces and share value are 
externally oriented two core technologyexpertise and financial 
resources are internal 
these four strategical planning elements he states are most 
commonly found in todays restructurings since all play vital 
roles in refocusing efforts on the new and developing realities of 
the marketplace 
1 marketing the big change is that corporations are finding 
they must give equal attention to three growing markets america 
europe and asia it creates a need to balance operating assets 
around three markets not one 
2 share value corporations are realizing that discounted cash 
flow whats left over at the end of the year after paying 
expenses is more important than officially reported earnings in 
attracting investor attention 
in jennings opinion the investing public is aware that 
earnings are too easily manipulated to disguise weaknesses in a 
company cash flow discounted for the cost of capital is 
considered a more reliable indicator of health 
companies are of course concerned about the price of their 
shares a higher than average price for shares provides a financial 
advantage over the competition 
3 core technology and expertise these says jennings must 
be preserved at all costs preserving them is not easy since the 
hardnosed competitive atmosphere and changing markets mean they are 
constantly under attack 
a common situation today for example 
a company whose core technology and expertise is to supply 
widgets doesnt have the luxury of continuing to make only widgets 
when the marketplace demands widgets encased in a larger system it 
must learn to make the system 
among manufacturers subsystems of several components are 
in for one thing they may be easier to assemble service and 
replace the widgetmaker and supplier must protect his widget 
expertise by encasing it in a system 
4 financial resources this concerns the extent to which a 
company has access to debt financing and equity capital and at what 
cost the lower the better of course 
among other things this places a premium on maintaining the 
share price of stock buybacks of outstanding shares is one way to 
do it even before its latest buyback ibm had set aside 64 
billion for such purposes since 1986 
jennings a michigan state university professor of business and 
adviser to top corporate managers sees these four elements in a 
restless mix that makes strategic planning good for only two to 
four years 
the message is a harsh one for companies accustomed to a slower 
pace but he sees no escape from the rapid rate of change 
companies simply cannot stay put in their thinking their 
environment is not static they must restructure 
an illustration of this can be found in the experience of the 40 
excellent companies chosen early in the decade by author tom 
peters for his book in search of excellence 
all but eight of the 40 according to jennings count have been 
through two restructurings since they were deemed excellent

its 10 pm curfew 
time police in camouflage fatigues tell diners sipping coffee at 
the pivoli gardens they must leave the restaurant 
nobody complains 
i dont mind at all said omi rahim it keeps all the 
troublemakers off the streets 
like others in st croix ms rahim vividly remembers the three 
chaotic days after hurricane hugo devastated the island sept 17 
when hundreds of looters plundered stores of everything from food 
and clothes to vcrs and jewelry the authorities say some police 
officers and members of the national guard took part in the looting 
the turmoil prompted president bush on sept 21 to send 1100 
army troops most of them military police along with 170 fbi 
agents and federal marshals to restore order in the us territory 
with most stores cleaned out the looting had stopped by the 
time the troops arrived 
more than two months after the storm 80 percent of st croix 
still lacks electricity water and telephone service but the 
troops were ordered home before thanksgiving and were replaced by 
146 national guard mps from washington dc 
many of st croixs 55000 residents say it was too early to 
pull the troops out 
theres no electricity and there are no phones and we have no 
way to call police said waiter javier ureta 31 the island is 
not ready to have people move around like normal days 
maj doug foster a us army spokesman said that before 
leaving the army set up 14 citizens band stations equipped with 
telephones for emergencies a curfew is to remain in effect until 
power and communications are restored 
st croix 40 miles east of puerto rico was among the islands 
hardest hit by hurricane hugo as it swept up the caribbean before 
hitting the carolinas 
the territorial government has estimated damage at 1 billion in 
st croix and its sister islands st thomas and st john while 
the other two islands are bouncing back quickly officials say 
recovery could take years in st croix where the storms 200mph 
winds damaged or destroyed 90 percent of the houses and buildings 
tourism st croix lifeblood is a writeoff this season for the 
most part and despite a construction boom there are fears of 
soaring unemployment because scores of businesses were wiped out 
st croix hospital with 250 beds remains closed and doctors 
are seeing patients in tents behind the building 
thousands live in roofless homes under temporary blue plastic 
roofs or in red cross tents as they wait for the relief checks from 
insurance companies and the federal emergency management agency 
in charlotte amalie on st thomas the top floor of bishop sean 
omalleys house was blown off but a box containing his miters 
remained in place in st croix workmen had to retile the roof of 
the cormorant beach club a hotel and condominium complex and it 
has been able to reopen for the winter season 
hundreds have fled the island perhaps permanently for those 
who have stayed to rebuild life can be a struggle 
when you go without electricity day after day for weeks and 
you dont have water and you dont have a roof over your head and 
there are no phones and you cant communicate with the outside 
world well theres a lot of stress said commercial 
photographer carol lee 
about 400 linesmen from a dozen states guam and puerto rico are 
repairing lines of 15000 downed electricity poles the virgin 
islands water and power authority has said it could be spring 
before electricity is fully restored meanwhile the utility is 
investigating reports of some workers charging homeowners up to 
500 to turn power on 
but children have returned to school shelters for victims have 
closed and many stores and restaurants along with a few hotels are 
back in business using generators for power 
some crucians as residents are known complain that accounts 
after the hurricane made the looting appear to be an uprising among 
blacks who make up 85 percent of the population against the 
wealthier whites they scoff at reports of machetewielding black 
gangs roaming the streets 
i didnt see any white people attacked but i sensed fear 
among the white people said rena brodhurstknight publisher of 
the st croix avis newspaper who is black she said machetes 
commonly used in the caribbean as tools were probably mistaken by 
outsiders as weapons 
the us attorneys office has filed charges against 15 alleged 
looters including adelbert bryan commander of the fredericksted 
police who was a gubernatorial candidate and a former st croix 
senator

it is a solemn moment in the show hodding 
carter iii a top official during the carter administration is 
puzzled why the pentagon the state department and the white house 
wont comment on santa claus 
when he was in the state department he adds not once did i 
hear somebody say or did i read anything suggesting that santa 
claus did not exist 
but then the show anchored and narrated by former nbc 
correspondent jack perkins is about santa claus a syndicated 
onehour special called there really is a santa claus 
airing on various nights this month on stations in 123 cities 
its a lighthearted documentary about various facets of the 
man in the red suit and white whiskers all of it an effort to 
prove he exists 
celebrities like edward james olmos mickey mantle and loretta 
lynn are participants as are men of learning one of whom believes 
in the possibility of flying reindeer 
even police in fairbanks alaska get in the act one 
responding to a call asks a homeowner deadpan he actually was 
on your roof in a sleigh 
and of course kids periodically get a say in all this 
the men of learning include a dartmouth university professor 
john rassias a santa claus expert and a santas helper dr carl 
anderson a psychologist who wrote his university of texas 
dissertation on santa claus 
the reason he did that anderson explains is that i was 
struck by the intensity of the childrens belief and the joy and 
excitement that they experienced when they visited santa 
conceived and produced by david lowe jr a former 60 
minutes staffer the show examines the matter of santa from all 
angles his origins his flying reindeer how he knows if youve 
been naughty or nice and so forth 
in a section dealing with how christmas toys get to less 
fortunate kids it also slips in a gentle plug for the marine corps 
reserves toys for tots campaign founded 42 years ago by retired 
reserve col williams hendricks 
the show has its faults mainly that it gets a bit too cutesy 
now and then but on balance its a pretty good holiday special 
particularly for tykes who may find its findings reassuring in a 
world that sometimes seems populated by grinches with souls of 
garlic 
as anderson quoting a little boy puts it that theres 
somebody somewhere in this cruel world who loves children and cares 
about them thats what santas all about

some call it a catch22 snare zapped if they do and zapped 
if they dont thats the predicament claimed for some students at 
westside high school in omaha neb who want an offhours bible 
club 
the problem has surfaced at numerous public schools across the 
country 
federal courts have issued conflicting opinions about it and 
although congress has passed a special law allowing for such clubs 
the issue is now before the us supreme court 
several church groups supporting student rights to form such 
groups contend westside put a doublenix on it barring the club 
for lack of school sponsorship although such sponsorship would 
make the club unconstitutional 
either way its out according to the school boards position 
amounting to a selfimposed catch22 for the students the 
church groups say in a brief supporting the students appeal to the 
supreme court 
efforts at organizing such clubs strictly by student initiative 
and without official school involvement has had a rocky and 
litigious course in many communities throughout this decade 
trying to dispel the confusion congress adopted the equal 
access act in 1984 guaranteeing student religious groups the same 
rights to meet in offclass hours as other nonacademic 
extracurricular groups 
the law was based on rights of free speech that schools with a 
limited open forum allowing students to organize clubs about 
politics dancing archery bridge or whatever also must allow 
clubs that talk religion 
but schools have remained skittish about any religious inklings 
on campus ever since the 196263 high court decisions banning 
sponsored prayer or bible readings 
some educators have come to believe that all religious speech 
must be extirpated from the schools the churches brief says 
but such a view fails to distinguish between officially sponsored 
speech and individual rights 
congress sought to end discrimination against student religious 
speech but the brief says this case shows that at least some 
local school officials fundamentally reject each and every premise 
on which congress acted 
on the other hand the american jewish committee which opposes 
the act has filed a brief contending that to allow a school 
religious club would open the door to organized religious 
activities in public schools 
in a dispute at the wiliamport pa high school the supreme 
court in 1986 affirmed the right of students to meet for bible and 
prayer outside classtime but the case was decided on a technical 
point not generally applicable 
early this year a federal appeals court ruled against a student 
religious group at a renton wash high school giving the school 
discretion to allow clubs considered even remotely related to 
education but not if religious 
in the dispute at westside high school a federal district court 
upheld the school boards refusal to allow a religious club while 
permitting about 30 other other clubs such as for chess and scuba 
diving 
but a federal appeals court overturned that decision rejecting 
the schools position that the various clubs were 
curriculumrelated 
that claim the court said would allow a school administration 
simply to choose whatever clubs it wished for vague reasons but 
then to discriminate against particular student groups because 
of religious speech 
it would be tragic if the court allows a school board to 
eviscerate the equal acess act by declaring all clubs except 
relgious ones to be curriculumrelated says oliver thomas 
general counsel for the baptist joint committee on public affairs 
other groups joining in the brief were the christian legal 
scoiety the national association of evangelicals the presbyterian 
church usa and the church of jesus christ of latterday saints 
us catholic bishops have filed their own brief affirming 
rights of students to form voluntary bible clubs 
the brief says the action of the school officials instead of 
upholding the constitution have created a constitutional problem 
by inhibiting religious activity and conveying a message of 
disapproval of religious activity to both the students involved and 
the community at large 
oral arguments before the supreme court are expected to be heard 
this month or early next year with a decision by next summer 
meanwhile bridget megens who with friends initiated attempts 
for a bible club at westside high school in 1984 and is now married 
and the mother of a young daughter says i was afraid there 
might not be anybody to carry the torch 
however she says about 15 students still are pushing the 
effort there are even some kids who are not christians who are 
interested she told the monthly church and state 
she says she hopes the dispute will be resolved so her daughter 
can belong to a bible study group at her high school when she grows 
up

this is a summary of the disaster assistance act of 1988 and 
procedures farmers followed to collect aid 
the program originally was written to provide cash to farmers 
who suffered crop losses of more than 35 percent due to drought 
hail excessive moisture or related condition in 1988 
farmers who lost more than 65 percent of their normal harvest 
were required to protect themselves with federal crop insurance 
this year 
the bill covered all crops in all states not just drought 
areas as its regulations moved from the halls of congress to the 
county offices where the checks were written the list of weather 
conditions eligible for aid grew it eventually included 
depending on the individual county insects sandstorms fungus 
high winds and cold 
the bill required farmers to state their acreage whether it was 
irrigated andor insured the normal yield and the actual 
production on that acreage they also had to state the cause for 
their loss and in what manner the land had been farmed 
their applications for aid were approved or denied by 
threemember committees of locally elected farmers serving as the 
governments agents 
regulations require only 5 percent of aid applications to be 
verified for accurate information although many offices said they 
routinely checked 15 percent as with other farm payment programs 
paperwork remained at the county offices no regulation requires 
data on individual farms to be routinely forwarded to state or 
federal headquarters 
the relief act stated that payments were limited to 100000 per 
farmer and that no producer with gross revenues in excess of 2 
million was eligible for aid 
checks were written at the county office only county totals of 
aid not individual summaries were fed into national computers 
federal agriculture officials have not yet compiled figures on the 
amount of aid disbursed based on the crops damaged or on the 
specific weather problems cited for crop losses

the 1988 drought assistance bill for us 
farmers set a record for disaster programs totaling 39 billion 
in payments when all applications had been processed 
this year with the drought area reduced and the severity 
lessened congress tightened eligibility requirements and pulled 
the purse strings tighter authorizing less than 25 percent of the 
money released in 1988 
here are details of the two relief programs 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
congress authorized 39 billion in cash payments to farmers 
who could prove crop losses in 1988 the 1989 authorization is 897 
million 
both programs set a 100000 limit per producer on combined 
payments for crop losses and livestock relief 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
under each program an applicant could not have a gross annual 
income greater than 2 million 
growers had to absorb crop losses if they totaled less than 35 
percent of normal production the programs differed for losses 
above 35 percent 
the 1988 bill encompassed all crops from such program crops 
as corn wheat and cotton that the government supports with price 
subsidies to riskier crops like kiwi fruit or endive 
the 1989 bill pays on losses of 35 percent to 50 percent only 
for program crops farmers of nonprogram crops are paid only if 
losses totaled more than 50 percent of a normal harvest whether 
producers receive aid also depends on whether they participated in 
federal commodity programs and bought crop insurance 
the 1988 bill provided two tiers of payment farmers received 
65 percent of a preestablished payment rate based on such 
factors as market prices and subsidies for losses of 35 percent 
to 75 percent of normal production they got 90 percent of the 
payment rate if losses topped 75 percent 
in 1989 the highest payment for any loss was 65 percent of the 
payment rate 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
both programs required farmers with losses greater than 65 
percent to buy federal crop insurance the subsequent year each 
bill permitted some instances in which crop insurance could be 
waived 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
the 1988 bill permitted farmers to receive aid on the early 
loss of crops such as winter wheat or cotton even if they 
replanted the same acres with different crops and had normal 
harvests 
to prevent such double dipping the 1989 law sharply reduced 
benefits to farmers who chose to plant replacement crops due to 
drought or other weather conditions critics said this penalized 
farmers who were simply trying to help themselves and the law was 
modified in october to be more generous 
as modified aid payments on damaged crops will be reduced only 
if the value of the replacement crop is more than half of the 
countys average yield and then only by the value above the 50 
percent threshold 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
both programs provided help for livestock producers expanding 
existing feed and water programs to relieve droughtrelated 
shortages for herds eligible livestock include cattle sheep 
goats swine poultry horses and mules and fish raised in 
commercial ponds

the drought of 1988 hit hardest in the upper 
midwest perhaps nowhere harder than in north dakota more 
disaster relief aid went there than to any other state the third 
story in a fourpart series cashing in on the drought 
examines how the 39 billion disaster aid program helped farmers 
most in need 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
carl grindberg survived the drought with 
a 45000 dose of federal aid but for this farmer and others it 
was a giveandtake bailout take the money with one hand give it 
away with the other 
the guy who sold me 5000 of fuel he got paid grindberg 
said the business that sold me fertilizer and spray and 
chemicals and tires they got paid what im saying is the farmer 
got the money directly but indirectly a lot of others benefited 
the 1988 drought relief program poured more than 400 million 
into north dakota the nations most agriculturally dependent 
state the money not only helped rescue thousands of farmers many 
say it also kept the state afloat 
its what carried us through in 1988 said cass county 
extension agent duane hauck if it hadnt been for drought aid 
the economic situation all through north dakota would have been 
disastrous it was the major source of income for most farmers 
i dont think too many farmers took disaster aid and bought 
cadillacs and went on vacation in my area grindberg added 
a study of the 39 billion disaster relief program conducted 
by the associated press over seven months found that outside the 
midwest drought area lax rules and requirements led to thousands 
of farmers collecting millions of dollars for nothing more serious 
than the normal trials of nature 
but money did reach areas congress most intended to aid 
including north dakota where it kept some farmers on their land 
and may have prevented some business closures 
you might say it kept the state alive said fred selberg 
another farmer in this red river valley county everyone in north 
dakota in some way or another was helped 
north dakota where the drought evoked memories of dust bowl 
days with tumbleweed dancing along the barren horizon received the 
most disaster dollars more than 49000 producers shared 4102 
million about 105 percent of the total package almost all was 
for crop loss 
the state the no 1 producer of hardred spring wheat lost 
twothirds of its 1988 crop millions of normally golden acres 
withered to pathetic rows of shriveled brown stumps but drought 
aid cut farmers losses from 11 billion to 706 million a north 
dakota state university study found 
disaster payments reduced statewide losses to businesses banks 
and households from 34 billion to 21 billion the study said 
each farm dollar triples as it travels down main street into the 
economy 
another university survey of 466 farmers said that without 
drought aid the average farmers net cash income would have been 
just 6300 drought payments added 15000 
disaster aid and crop insurance also were critical to other 
droughtravaged states including iowa illinois minnesota and 
wisconsin the five states together received nearly half the 
assistance allocated nationwide 
disaster aid and crop insurance pumped about 500 million into 
iowas economy an iowa state university study said 
there was no question it was needed to stave off a major new 
wave of bankruptcies and financial problems among corn belt 
producers said mark edelman a university economist 
even the drought assistance for most farmers fell well short 
of bringing what their income would be with normal yields but it 
provided a safety net he said 
it was the same in north dakota which has struggled with an 
exodus of young educated people declining revenues fading small 
towns and the loss of nearly a fifth of its farms this decade 
from 81 through 86 the bottom pretty much fell out of 
everything said greg schulz who farms about five miles from 
grindberg good crops the next two years started to reverse the 
trend but drought stalled the recovery 
it has a demoralizing effect when you have a disaster said 
dwight aakre a north dakota state economist financial aid helps 
to alleviate that the last thing north dakota needed is more 
negatives to push us down 
despite relief and nearly 200 million in crop insurance the 
state still needs a good year to get back on our feet hauck 
said we didnt get that in 89 he added referring to 
continuing drought in north dakotas west and southcentral 
sections 
in fact while crops statewide are in better shape than 12 
months ago dollar losses will exceed 1988s estimated 530 
million aakre said two reasons why more acres of wheat were 
planted this year and farmers dont have grain reserves to sell at 
high prices as they did in 1988 to ease their burden 
cass county also had a better 1989 crop but expects higher 
losses in crop dollars and while virtually all farmers here 
received government aid in 1988 far fewer will be eligible a 
second time 
about 198 million in 1988 aid was divvied up among 1847 farms 
in cass county the states leader in crop acres wheat corn 
barley soybeans sugar beets and navy and pinto beans are grown 
here last year production was 60 percent to 70 percent below 
normal 
for larry richard a 36yearold father of three who farms 1000 
acres near the town of horace 39000 in aid even coupled with 
55000 in crop insurance amounted to just enough to break even 
we were able to cover all our bills thats all i had really hoped 
for 
if that seems like a lot richard who grows wheat soybeans and 
barley notes it costs him 150000 for rent interest seed 
fertilizer equipment and other necessities 
you throw a lot of expenses way ahead of what your crop is 
going to be he said our investment in farming is tremendous 
compared to the average businessman at least they have a commodity 
to sell we might not 
schulz who farms 6000 acres said that without his 100000 
maximum payment he might have been forced to sell equipment or lay 
off help 
along with crop insurance and the sale of grain reserves he 
said i was able to mark time in 88 last year we had a 
breakeven type of year this year it was breakeven next year 
were going to have to start coming around to a profit 
grindberg who farms 900 acres of wheat soybeans and barley 
was in the red last year despite 70000 in aid and insurance his 
1989 crop was better but still below normal he expects to get only 
3000 in relief payments 
grindberg a 40year farming veteran who also delivers mail 
parttime thinks the government last year pushed the panic 
button on this disaster thing and went too far in 89 they went 
too far the other way i think 
disaster aid is political he said depending on when you 
have the disaster depends on whether they sweeten the pot or not 
if its an election year they all get on the bandwagon 
but grindberg will persist 
as long as the banker says go on he said next years 
always the best year

told he qualified for 1200 
six hundred dollars an hour dempsey said with a grin as he 
milked his 140 guernseys in his long open barn thats not bad 
pay about the same as a lawyer 
dempsey makes no apologies about taking the money it was 
there and i took advantage of it he said but he doesnt favor a 
repeat of the program 
it would make people say i can put crops in the ground and if 
it doesnt grow ill collect he said

chester lathem and his family are what you might call 
diversified farmers they run a real estate company grow wheat 
corn and milo raise cattle and own three oil wells that exxon 
operates on their texas panhandle land 
to participate in federal price support programs for their main 
crops of wheat corn and milo they have to set aside some acres 
in 1988 they planted potatoes on 125 of those acres and saw hail 
wipe out the crop other crops did well 
but the lathem family was far from being knocked out of farming 
by hail on potatoes planted on excess acres 
their farm formally named the lico partnership received 
134087 under the drought program legally exceeding the 100000 
singlefarmer aid limit because the partnership is owned by four 
family members 
the potatoes were insured and were expected to gross 223600 
for lico according to licos file at the agricultural 
stabilization and conservation service insurance plus the disaster 
aid brought 214153 without the expense of harvest which lathem 
said would have been twothirds the cost of raising the potatoes 
still he said he only broke even on the potato acreage 
you bet it was necessary lathem said we wouldnt have 
lost the farm over it but we probably would have had to do some 
things differently it would have been much tougher to go back and 
plant crops for the new year i think it was a good program

the 1987 growing year plagued by heavy rain and high winds was 
horrible for ted white a chaves county nm cotton grower but 
no disaster payment program existed to help him then 
white got luckier in 1988 because of the recordsetting drought 
in the midwest although he had a better crop in 1988 he was able 
to collect disaster aid 
i had a cold cold cold rain and then that wind that comes 
down like on a runway and just cuts the cotton said white about 
half his cotton was wiped out last year although his irrigated 
fields still yielded a healthy 355 pounds per acre and he made 
about twothirds of his normal gross based on government payment 
rates 
insurance paid 8959 and drought aid approved by the local 
ascs office paid 18285 even though the disaster law included 
neither cold weather nor high winds

last year was not the luckiest for carl race jr who grows 
apples and corn in blairstown nj a well that fed a special 
trickle irrigation system for some of his orchards dried up a pump 
that watered his corn failed at the height of the dry weather 
yet race weathered the drought well good production on other 
acres eased his losses so he went to the county office with some 
trepidation to inquire about the 1988 drought relief program 
he learned he was entitled to a payment but he felt 
uncomfortable with government programs 
its kind of a personal pride thing you think youre asking 
for welfare he said i was thinking some low interest loans of 
45 percent that would be great 
instead he got cash nearly 12000 
i sat and wondered what am i going to do with 12000 he 
said i decided the best way to spend the money was to buy an 
irrigation pump 
he spent 13000 for a pump then came 1989 and its endless 
rains its been sitting out there rusting ever since race 
laughing said of his new pump

when drought parched 1988 crops a relief 
program was already in place but that program federally 
subsidized crop insurance has been a shambles for years the final 
story in a series cashing in on the drought shows even 
critics believe congress must rely on a stronger insurance network 
to eliminate big bailouts that follow natural disasters 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
in 1980 congress expanded its 42yearold federal crop 
insurance program the goal was simple farmers would better cover 
themselves against the vagaries of nature and taxpayers would be 
spared costly disaster payments to farmers 
it hasnt turned out that way 
sales of crop insurance are well below expected levels the 
program is billions deep in red ink and under scrutiny after years 
of alleged mismanagement congress still bails out farmers with 
huge relief programs like the 1988 drought bill 
farmers are just the same as wall street theyll take a 
gamble if it means money said ed jones a farmer and former 
tennessee congressman who sponsored the 1980 bill they dont 
care about insurance if they think they are going to get a disaster 
payment 
last year was perfect illustration with only 13 percent of the 
nations estimated 33 million farmers relying on 
governmentsubsidized insurance they collected 39 billion in 
direct aid and an additional 11 billion in crop insurance 
payments 
an associated press study of the 1988 disaster program found 
farmers who said they were made whole by both programs earning 
as much or more in insurance claims and disaster payments as they 
would have with normal harvests 
while congress passed a law for crop insurance to be the 
single source of aid in a time of disaster that never happened 
because congress refused to let it happen said cliff fowler an 
assistant director at the general accounting office which issued 
20 reports on problems with crop insurance over the last nine years 
congress would come in with disaster payments a free bailout 
any time there was a disaster said fowler if you were a 
farmer why would you buy insurance if congress is going to bail 
you out for free 
farmers wise to the ways of politics agree 
youd be crazy to buy insurance if you can count on a disaster 
program said m donald clifton ii a milton del farmer who 
received a 100000 disaster payment for peas and lima beans lost 
to drought last year 
clifton also collected insurance on some losses but he is no 
fan you could hit it close if you bought insurance on odd number 
years and didnt on election years when youre more likely to get 
aid he said 
yet crop insurance is still considered the best protection for 
farmers a september gao report said insurance is a more 
equitable and efficient way to provide disaster assistance than 
emergency loan and direct payment programs 
until this decade crop insurance begun in 1938 was limited to 
26 crops on 10 percent of the nations farmland 
that changed with the federal crop insurance act of 1980 a bill 
to make insurance all farmers first line of defense against losses 
from drought flood insects and blight 
congress envisioned a selfsustaining program farmers would buy 
insurance to cover losses just like any other business enterprise 
government clerks would be replaced by private agents selling 
policies amid corn rows and wheat fields 
most importantly disaster payments would be phased out 
banishing these expensive programs essentially free insurance for 
farmers would trim the budget and make growers more responsible 
there were abuses examples of people planting even when 
there was no soil moisture and they knew there would be no 
harvest said james johnson a former staff member with the house 
agriculture committee farmers used bad management knowing there 
was this entitlement at the end of the crop year 
crop insurance coverage grew slowly over the decade last year 
only 25 percent of the nations farm fields were insured well 
under the 50 percent targeted by congress 
the figure hit 40 percent this year but only because farmers 
who were paid for losses greater than 65 percent last year had to 
buy insurance for 1989 
the federal crop insurance corp has lost money every year since 
1980 a total of more than 4 billion losses in 1988 alone 
amounted to 579 million 
as the federal tab for crop insurance went up so did the cost 
of the special disaster programs the insurance was to eliminate 
from 1974 to 1980 farmers received 3 billion in disaster payments 
the cost has soared beyond 7 billion this decade 
insurance rates are based on the risk insurance companies run of 
paying a claim car insurance rates for example are based on 
actuarial study of losses to accidents and theft the amount of 
money the insurer is likely to pay and the amount of premium money 
the company is likely to collect and invest 
but the fcic without a certified actuary until 1986 made 
optimistic forecasts that didnt match experience one example 
premium income grew by only 10 percent from 1982 through 1986 
never exceeding 440 million a year yet the fcic predicted premium 
income of 700 million in 1987 it collected little more than half 
that 
the program is actuarily unsound acknowledged john 
marshall fcic manager since 1988 to some extent our problems 
are the result of expanding too rapidly we didnt get our rates 
policies and procedures in place based on good research 
jackie king a rehoboth del insurance agent recalls a policy 
that lumped lima beans and snap beans together even though they 
have different growing seasons and risks 
when i called to talk to the man who wrote the policy he 
said i didnt know there was a difference between a lima bean and 
a snap bean she said i told them i was going to put the 
policy under my desk i wasnt going to insult these farmers 
the corporation has been criticized for not keeping a tight rein 
on the private insurers who sell and service crop insurance a 1987 
gao study found farmers were overpaid an average of 31 percent on 
claims 
at present farmers can insure 50 65 or 75 percent of their 
crop in the way a car owner chooses a deductible on auto 
insurance farmers also choose what percentage of market price to 
be compensated for the fcic subsidizes 15 percent to 30 percent of 
premium costs depending on coverage but rates and regulations 
change yearly 
if youre going to insure a 1981 bronco you get a quote and 
its done said ms king with crop insurance you have 
different levels of coverage and different price selections it can 
get really confusing 
with all its problems even critics believe crop insurance is 
improving a recent gao study found the overpayment rate had 
dropped to 16 percent the fcic is studying decades of weather and 
crop reports to bring premiums in line with the actual cost of 
insuring a crop 
we are seeing some bright spots said marshall 
but concern remains that the crop insurance program cant 
succeed if farmers believe they will be protected by special 
disaster programs 
you either have a permanent disaster payment program or you 
never do it again and have insurance said johnson the former 
staff member with the house agriculture committee 
you have to do that before people will believe in one system 
or the other

to hear agriculture department economists tell 
it the nations farmers as a group havent had it so good in 
years 
that would seem to go against all evidence in plain sight the 
money crunches of the middle 1980s and the droughts of the last two 
years were painful sometimes terminal for thousands of farm 
families 
no one is sure how many farmers had to leave the land annual 
estimates by the agriculture department indicate that about 267000 
farms disappeared in the 1980s a decrease from 244 million in 
1980 to about 217 million in 1989 of those 40000 have dropped 
out since 1987 
but not all of those left farming due to failure bankruptcy 
foreclosure or drought each decade realizes some attrition 
compare the 267000 dropouts in the 1980s with 516000 in the 
1970s 1 million in the 1960s and 17 million in the 1950s 
drought in 1988 hurt vast areas particularly the midwest and 
upper great plains and in places the land remains parched with 
too little moisture soaking below the surface 
but most farmers profited as the 1988 drought reduced crop 
yields and drove up prices this fall bigger corn yields have 
driven down prices of feed grains making it cheaper to feed 
cattle hogs and chickens but hurting the grain farmers 
the 1989 corn harvest is up 54 percent from last years 
droughtshriveled crop wheat is up 13 percent and the soybean 
crop is 25 percent larger 
in 1987 according to the departments economic research 
service farmers net cash income rose to a record 577 billion 
from 518 billion in 1986 and 467 billion in 1985 
the climb marked a turnaround in farm fortunes after falling 
land values high interest rates and heavy debts squeezed hard in 
the early 1980s 
in 1988 net cash income rose further to 599 billion 
reflecting higher crop prices because of the drought nearrecord 
government payments and sales of stored surpluses 
this year with government payments declining surpluses running 
out and farmers spending more to expand crop acreage net cash 
income is expected to decline to 53 billion in 1990 according to 
the latest projections net cash income may rise to almost 55 
billion 
net cash income as defined by the economic research service is 
the difference between gross cash income and cash expenses in a 
calendar year its money left over that can buy new equipment 
retire debt and support the farm family 
another measurement is called net farm income this includes the 
value of farm inventories of grain cattle hogs and other 
production in a calendar year along with allowances for other 
nonmoney items such as the value of homegrown food and 
xisting dwellings 
by that reckoning net farm income rose to 324 billion in 
1985 38 billion in 1986 and 471 billion in 1987 last year 
according to this method net farm income declined to 457 billion 
still the second highest on record 
net farm income this year is forecast at about 48 billion and 
it may be in the range of 44 billion to 49 billion in 1990 
these are national figures and agency analysts are quick to 
acknowledge that many farmers are suffering financially even when 
farmers as a group are enjoying the best of times 
but even some state statistics show farmers have fared better in 
recent years than many would have believed likely in the early 80s 
for example net cash income increased in 33 states in 1988 
despite the drought even in some of the states that were hardest 
hit 
on the basis of net farm income which take farmerheld 
inventories into account 27 states showed increases from 1987 
overall the countrys farm financial performance continued to 
improve in 1988 as it had in 1986 and 1987 said usda economist 
mitch morehart 
morehart noted that direct government payments to farmers which 
peaked at 167 billion in 1987 dropped 13 percent to 145 
billion in 1988 the latest estimates put direct payments at 11 
billion in 1989 and 8 billion to 11 billion in 1990 
annual records kept by the agriculture department indicate that 
total farm assets mostly land have been increasing since they 
dropped to 7871 billion in 1986 the record high was more than 
11 trillion in 1981 this years assets are forecast at 849 
billion and may grow to as much as 890 billion in 1990 
total farm debt by 1988 was 138 billion and may drop to 136 
billion in 1989 in the early and mid1980s us farm debt was as 
high as 2065 billion including family household debt

federal bureaucrats and private insurers are 
scrambling to rework health insurance benefits adjust premiums and 
spread the word that the end is near for medicares yearold 
catastrophic health care program 
in addition millions of senior citizens are refiguring their 
expected 1989 tax bills the internal revenue service is scrapping 
form 8808 before it hits the printing press and states are trying 
to figure out how they will cover an extra 300 million to 400 
million in health care expenses for the poor 
the medicare catastrophic coverage act expected to cost 48 
billion in its first five years was enacted with fanfare in 1988 
to protect 33 million elderly and disabled people against financial 
ruin from the staggering costs of prolonged illness 
but even before most of the benefits took effect congress voted 
last month to dismantle the program because of a firestorm of 
protest from senior citizens who complained it cost them too much 
president bush has promised to sign the repeal measure 
under repeal the health care financing administration must take 
back the extended hospitalization and nursing home coverage it has 
offered medicare beneficiaries for the past year and scrap plans to 
provide expanded coverage of drug and doctor bills and other 
medical expenses 
louis b hays the acting hcfa administrator said a top 
priority for the agency is to get notices out to medicare 
beneficiaries explaining the new limits on their hospital and 
nursing home benefits 
we want to make sure that there isnt confusion hays said 
the agency also can forget about providing additional medical 
benefits that we had invested enormous energy and time in 
preparing to implement he said 
the irs and the social security administration meanwhile have 
the tasks of rolling back the income tax surcharge on the elderly 
and the extra medicare premium that financed the catastrophic 
program the surtax was canceled completely the extra premium will 
be scrapped at the end of the year 
irs spokesman henry holmes said taxpayers will be instructed to 
ignore two lines on this years 1040 tax forms lines 54 and 55 
which refer senior citizens to the elusive form 8808 that never got 
beyond the prototype stage 
higherincome senior citizens would have used 8808 to calculate 
their added income tax liability for the medicare benefits senior 
citizens who paid extra amounts in quarterly income tax payments or 
through wage withholding to cover the medicare surtax will get any 
overpayments back as part of their income tax refund holmes said 
about 40 percent of the elderly would have paid some surtax 
2250 for every 150 of federal income tax liability with about 
6 percent paying the maximum amount of 800 per person this year 
scrapping the tax is the type of lastminute change it is easy 
to spring on taxpayers holmes said 
everybody enjoys hearing news that they dont have to pay a 
tax that was on the books he said 
the social security administration meanwhile is complaining 
that congress did not give the agency enough lead time to stop 
withholding extra medicare premiums that helped finance the 
catastrophic benefits it may be april or may before extra payments 
of about 530 a month no longer are deducted from social security 
checks with the overpayments to be refunded later the premiums of 
4 a month during 1989 will not be refunded 
the bottom line is that social security will unscramble this 
egg but we did not lay it said social security commissioner 
gwendolyn king 
the repeal also is causing lastminute maneuvering among private 
insurers who will pick up some of the benefits being canned by the 
government about 70 percent of elderly americans purchase private 
medigap insurance to fill the gaps in their medicare coverage 
the national association of insurance commissioners has until 
dec 15 to draft transition regulations for medigap policies and 
private insurers have until jan 30 to revise their policies and 
premiums and notify policyholders of the changes any changes 
however will be retroactive to jan 1 when the government 
benefits expire 
insurance companies are doing their best theyre just 
grumbling about how long it took congress to make up their mind 
said alan richards of the health insurance association of america 
its kind of a well muddle through situation we just hope 
congress doesnt change their mind again next year 
the association has estimated medigap premiums will rise 20 
percent to 25 percent next year due to the combined effects of 
rising medical costs and the repeal of the catastrophic package 
fallout from the repeal also is reaching state governments the 
repeal legislation left in place expanded medicaid costs for the 
states while scrapping provisions that would have offset some of 
the new expenses said alicia pelrine of the national governors 
association 
grumbling is probably a tame word to describe what is going on 
out there ms pelrine said states are already so maxed out on 
their ability to accommodate various federal mandates that a 
lot are saying we dont know how were going to pay for this 
gerald miller executive director of the national association of 
state budget officers said the original catastrophic legislation 
would have cost states 900 million but the repeal bill boosts 
those costs by an additional 300 million to 400 million

japan is not letting its military guard down 
despite the easing of eastwest tensions in europe 
even after the sessions between president bush and mikhail s 
gorbachev off malta officials here say japans defense budget will 
continue the decadelong upward momentum that has made this country 
one of the worlds top military spenders 
our own efforts for improving our selfdefense are not 
expected to change at the moment foreign ministry spokesman 
taizo watanabe said at a news conference when asked if the 
bushgorbachev meetings would affect japans military spending 
seiki nishihiro vice minister of defense said recent movements 
in eastern europe and developments in ussoviet relations would 
be considered but he told reporters japan must continue its policy 
to reach the minimum standards of military preparedness set out in 
1976 japan and the soviet union have yet to sign a treaty to 
formally end world war ii 
there may have been a change in the soviets mood with the 
recent detente but we havent seen any practical reduction in 
force said a defense agency official who requested anonymity 
we cant start cutting our forces just because they say they plan 
to cut theirs 
washington agrees with japan about soviet forces in northeast 
asia but is talking about cutting its own defense outlays the us 
congress meanwhile is calling on japan to spend more to help make 
us reductions possible 
under heavy pressure from capitol hill president bush has 
signed a defense bill that urges japan to increase its military 
spending and requires the us executive to negotiate an agreement 
for japan to completely offset the costs of maintaining the 50000 
american servicemen and women stationed here 
japan currently shoulders about 28 billion or 45 percent of 
the annual expenses for the americans in japan the japanese 
government has refused official comment on the bill signed by bush 
because of sensitivities caused by japans defeat in world war 
ii japan generally has observed a selfimposed ceiling of 1 
percent of gross national product on its defense spending 
although that mark has been surpassed slightly each year since 
1985 critics in the united states call the ceiling artificially 
low and compare it to the annual us defense budget of 300 
billion or roughly 6 percent of gnp western estimates put soviet 
military spending at roughly 15 percent to 25 percent of gnp 
tokyo has increased expenditures to support its 274000 military 
personnel by about 5 percent in real terms every year since 1980 
and its current defense outlays are roughly equal to those of 
britain west germany or france 
expenditures under japans current fiveyear plan will total 
765 billion and next years budget is expected to top 4 trillion 
yen 278 billion 
the increases have helped japan create a sophisticated 
antisubmarine network in straits vital to the soviet navy in the 
northwest pacific and build up an impressive number of advanced 
fighter jets which by 1990 will reach roughly 300 about the same 
number deployed by the us air force to defend the continental 
united states 
the buildup however risks alienating asian countries that 
harbor bitter memories of japanese invasions before and during 
world war ii 
at the same time antimilitary sentiment in japan coupled with 
a constitution that bans the use of military force has restricted 
the operations of the japanese selfdefense forces making it 
difficult for japanese politicians to meet us demands or their 
own goals to expand the military 
katsuyoshi kimura head of the opposition democratic socialist 
partys policy deliberation committee said in an interview that 
japanese troops should be allowed to take part in united nations 
ceasefire missions emergency rescues after natural disasters and 
other nonlethal tasks abroad 
all we are suggesting is that japan do what is common sense 
for other nations kimura said some people abroad say that 
japan is willing to put out the money but not the sweat 
after an unprecedented victory in diet elections last summer 
the leading opposition socialist party called for declaring japan a 
nuclearfree zone and conducting strict searches to ensure us 
navy ships entering japanese ports do not carry nuclear weapons 
the us 7th fleet is based in yokosuka just south of tokyo 
and a nuclearfree zone would challenge us policy of not 
revealing the location of the navys nuclear arms 
like a wall between soviet asia and the pacific ocean japan is 
both a first line of defense against the soviet military and a 
crucial us ally should war break out 
about 60 percent of all soviet ground and air force divisions 
and 90 percent of the bombers in the far east are deployed near 
japan according to defense of japan 1989 a defense agency 
report the soviet pacific fleet the largest in the soviet navy 
has its home port in vladivostok 
the soviets also have about 10000 soldiers on the southern 
kurils several small islands off hokkaido japans northernmost 
island the report said 
japan claims the islands known as the northern territories 
which were occupied by the soviets after world war ii and the 
territorial dispute has kept japan and the soviet union from 
signing a treaty officially ending their world war ii hostilities 
us ambassador michael h armacost in a recent interview said 
soviet forces in the region far exceed any defensive 
requirements and meaningful reductions have not been made 
to date the reductions they have foreshadowed do not have 
much effect on the forces that are located in the northeast asian 
region he said 
even so karl jackson bushs assistant national security 
council adviser said no one but a fool would risk waging war 
with the usjapan alliance in the northern pacific 
if the two largest economies in the world can maintain 
relative harmony all other potential adversaries must of 
necessity come to our table he said in a recent speech in 
washington

chinas decadelong shopping spree is over for 
now squelched by a government austerity program that has pushed 
the nation precariously close to recession 
color televisions an item the chinese once needed patience and 
good connections to obtain are piling up by the millions in 
warehouses 
the nations top refrigerator maker wanbao has slashed prices 
by up to 30 percent in some places because of poor sales 
in shanghai the nations industrial hub sales of televisions 
washing machines and cameras were all down more than 50 percent in 
october compared with a year earlier 
retail sales totaled 607 billion yuan or roughly 164 billion 
in the first three quarters of the year down 82 percent from the 
same period in 1988 if inflation is taken into account 
never before in the 10 years of chinas marketoriented reforms 
have sales declined so sharply on the contrary the enormous 
demand for consumer goods in china had led to sales leaps over most 
of the past decade 
sales of televisions for example went from 18 million in 1979 
to 266 million last year a reflection of how consumerism has been 
an important element in the communist partys economic 
restructuring but now it seems spending money is almost the 
exception not the rule 
people are saving their money because the economy is getting 
worse and they see hard times ahead said a woman office worker 
in beijing 
she said the bonuses she receives on top of her salary have been 
sharply cut since the chaos the military crackdown on the 
prodemocracy movement last june and that many workers were now 
receiving no bonuses 
western economists say consumers have been reluctant to spend 
money for a couple of reasons first they have been hit with 
mandatory purchases of government bonds imposed by the state to 
finance rising deficits second banks are offering attractive 
interest rates to depositors to keep money out of circulation and 
help restrain inflation 
urban incomes were down 4 percent in october from a year earlier 
due to inflation and disappearing bonuses state statistics show 
the conservative leadership that has gained dominance since june 
also has imposed new luxury taxes on some consumer goods to 
dull the nations appetite for items no longer deemed appropriate 
for plainliving socialists 
a 20inch color tv now sells for 3000 yuan or about 810 
double a factory workers annual income the cost includes a new 
600yuan consumer tax and a 300yuan tax to cover imported parts 
outwardly the government is complacent about the decline in 
retail sales saying it is a sacrifice that must be made to cool 
the economy and bring down inflation 
the governments spending slashes and tight money policy begun a 
year ago have reduced inflation from 30 percent to less than 10 
percent 
gong zhaorong a senior official in the light industry ministry 
told the chinese press recently that sales of durable goods are 
down because people are no longer worried about inflation and 
many people have already made major purchases during last years 
panic buying that accompanied the rapid rise in prices 
bank deposits nearly doubled in the first three quarters to 100 
billion yuan or about 27 billion another sign that the 
government had reined in the wild spending habits of 1988 
but economic retrenchment has come at a heavy price industrial 
output fell 21 percent in october the first decline in the past 
decade of reforms tens of thousands of smaller factories lacking 
credit to pay debts or buy raw materials have stopped production 
major machinery and electronics businesses alone accrued losses 
of 769 million yuan or about 208 million in the first nine 
months of the year and built up stockpiles worth 238 billion 
yuan or about 64 billion up 689 percent from a year earlier 
many factories committed to rigid state plans that oblige them 
to meet certain quotas have gone on producing and piling up 
inventories 
refrigerator production was up 134 percent through october even 
though sales were down at least 16 percent factories produced 75 
million color tvs up 58 percent even though 2 million sets sat 
in warehouses 
one western economist said the current credit squeeze and 
suppression of consumer demand could have the desirable effect of 
driving producers of shoddy lowquality goods out of business 
but the economist said china should use its current economic 
breathing space to restructure outmoded inefficient industries 
we dont see any concrete things happening she said 
the official china daily said chinese analysts are concerned 
that the huge buildup in savings represents a formidable purchasing 
potential that could deluge the market again in a panic buying 
spree if consumers felt prices might start rising sharply 
despite the current lull in buying china still faces a 
voracious consumer market of 11 billion people where vast numbers 
of people still do not own two of the hottest desirables a 
television and a washing machine 
slackened demand already has brought down prices on many 
consumer goods the price of a washing machine in beijings 
bustling wangfujing shopping district for example now is about 
920 yuan or 248 vs 1000 yuan in may 
a saleswoman at one supermarket said a bottle of maotai a 
muchprized sorghum liquor was marked at only 92 yuan or 25 
down from 200 yuan a few months ago 
since the chaos people are unhappy at heart so they are 
unwilling to spend so much she said

after a remarkably peaceful campaign 
chileans will choose a president thursday for the first time in 16 
years 
the door then will open for the departure from the presidency of 
gen augusto pinochet who has ruled since the armed forces 
overthrew the government of marxist salvador allende in 1973 
but it does not necessarily mean the 74yearold general will 
fade away 
the election is seen as a vote on the pinochet legacy and 
virtually all polls give the opposition a substantial lead over a 
rightwing candidate but even pinochets critics are accepting 
some of the many profound changes brought by the military leader 
three men are bidding to succeed pinochet 
patricio aylwin a 71yearold law professor and former senate 
president supported by a coalition of 17 moderate and leftist 
opposition parties 
hernan buchi 40 a former finance minister under pinochet 
backed by rightwing forces 
francisco javier errazuriz 47 a wealthy conservative 
businessman 
voters also will pick 38 senators and 120 members of congress 
lower house of deputies a decisive step in the long road back to 
democracy 
if no one wins the presidential race by more than 50 percent of 
the vote a runoff will be held in january or february for the two 
frontrunners 
aylwin has been given a commanding lead in virtually all 
preelection surveys and his two opponents acknowledge they are in 
a race against each other for the second runoff slot should aylwin 
fail to win half the total vote 
the new government is scheduled to take office march 11 
although the election is certain to bring radical changes to the 
political life of chiles 12 million people much of the 
freemarket economic program crafted by pinochets administration 
is expected to remain intact 
so far our transition to democracy is the most peaceful less 
traumatic in latin america and thats the result of a stable 
economy said jaime ravinet a close aide and spokesmen for 
aylwin 
thats why the platforms of all three candidates emphasize the 
need for political changes to rebuild democracy while despite 
some differences agreeing on the need of maintaining an open 
economy he said in an interview 
chileans pitched themselves enthusiastically into the first 
presidential campaign since 1970 when allende won by a slim margin 
pinochet toppled the allende government in a bloody coup sept 
11 1973 during a period of social and political disorder 
in the current campaign street vendors in the main cities have 
been doing a brisk business selling lapel pins cigarette lighters 
pens stickers match boxes and other objects with the names and 
photos of the candidates 
noisy motorcades have toured the streets especially on 
weekends with thousands of followers mostly young people waving 
party flags and promoting their candidates 
hundreds of campaign rallies have been held throughout the 
country a spokesman for the aylwin campaign said the candidate 
made as many as 15 speeches in a single day buchi ended his 
campaign with a marathon 11stop tour up and down the 
2800milelong country 
radio stations enjoyed a financial bonanza broadcasting the 
candidates paid political advertising television time was limited 
to 20 free minutes daily divided among the three presidential 
candidates and the same amount for congressional contenders 
authorities have reported only very sporadic and minor incidents 
of violence there was little of the open tension that was evident 
when voters in an october 1988 referendum rejected a military 
proposal to extend pinochets presidential term to 1997 that 
defeat forced pinochet to call this presidential election 
the first years of pinochets rule were marked by harsh 
repression of leftists many were tortured and killed and 
thousands were forced into exile human rights groups here and 
abroad say they have documented about 750 cases of dissidents who 
disappeared after being arrested by secutity agents 
dealing with the emotional demands for justice for human rights 
violations during the pinochet years will be one of the most 
sensitive problems facing the future government 
pinochet has warned he will not allow trials of the military and 
that if one of my men is touched the state of law will be 
broken 
aylwin has said he would deal with the problem combining the 
virtues of justice and prudence and we will not seek revenge 
but truth and justice 
even after handing over the presidency pinochet will retain 
considerable power he has vowed to remain as commander of the 
countrys 60000man army until 1998 which is permitted by the 
constitution written by his government in 1980 the opposition and 
even some moderate rightists and retired military officers have 
called on pinochet to retire 
under pinochets instruction the army command across the street 
from the presidential palace is being refurbished and pinochets 
opponents fear it will be just one of several power bases he will 
continue to control 
his administration has been pushing through a series of 
lastminute laws that would limit the powers of the future 
government 
as do all dictators pinochet is trying to leave essential 
matters firmly tied up after his departure said ricardo lagos a 
socialist and a leading opposition figure 
one new law gives the central bank autonomy in setting monetary 
and credit policies pinochet however agreed to include two 
opposition economists in the banks fivemember council 
another law allowed pinochet to create a national television 
council to control the issuing of tv broadcasting licenses 
yet to be passed is controversial legislation giving the 
military virtual independence it prevents the government from 
cutting the defense budget limits the presidentis power to 
appoint commandersinchief and strips the senate of any right to 
approve the promotions of generals and admirals 
the opposition has said it will work in the new congress to 
repeal or change those laws 
ravinet aylwins spokesman said one of the basic tasks of 
the new government will be to work in congress along with 
democratic forces even rightwing ones to change that 
legislation 
preelection surveys give aylwin 47 percent to 57 percent of the 
total vote his principal threat comes from buchi who is shown in 
the polls with 27 percent to 37 percent of the vote the polls 
indicate errazuriz has only a remote chance of capturing more than 
about 15 percent of the vote 
buchi is credited with the economic policies that have produced 
five years of growth stability and low inflation and has won 
praise among bankers and businessmen at home and abroad 
however the economic bonanza does not seem to be helping his 
campaign in which he tried to stress his independence from 
pinochet after 12 years in his administration

nominated by an opposition alliance of 17 leftist and centrist 
political groups virtually every opinion poll gives him a 
commanding lead over his two opponents 
at 71 he is the oldest candidate and was already a prominent 
politician when gen augusto pinochet seized power in a 1973 coup 
considered somewhat rightofcenter aylwin initially supported 
the military takeover but became disillusioned with pinochets 
strongarm tactics and reluctance to hand power back to civilians 
he gradually joined the ranks of the governments outspoken critics 
he is known as an able negotiator with a lowkey conciliatory 
style and he was the official spokesman for the opposition 
alliance when it successfully campaigned for the no vote in a 
referendum in october 1988 on a proposal that pinochet remain 
president until 1997 that defeat forced pinochet to call elections 
to pick a successor 
in the campaign aylwin has pledged to reestablish full respect 
for human rights and civil liberties and to increase spending on 
social programs he has said he plans no major changes in chiles 
freemarket economic program

looking back black political analysts see two 
threads linking the major victories of 1989 seasoned candidates 
who came up the democratic ladder the methodical oldfashioned 
way and campaign themes that deemphasized race in favor of 
broader mainstream issues 
looking ahead they see andrew young 
the twoterm mayor of atlanta will test that strategy next year 
a black candidate in quest of white votes to become governor of 
georgia 
a month after the elections in which virginia chose a black 
governor and black mayors were elected for the first time in new 
york and three other cities with white voter majorities the joint 
center for political studies sponsored a forum on what those 
contests may tell future candidates 
the next test is going to be andy young said political 
scientist joseph p mccormick ii of howard university 
youngs style and strategy reflect some of the winning ways 
shown by l douglas wilder in virginia and david dinkins in new 
york this year but political campaigns are not portable and there 
are major differences too young plays down the comparison saying 
that except for the fact that all three of them went to howard 
and we all happen to have the same skin color there isnt a lot 
we have in common 
one thing they have in common is a record to run on political 
apprenticeships the joint center analysts saw as vital ingredients 
in the black victories of 1989 wilder has been in virginia 
politics for 19 years dinkins has a 23year record in new york 
among other black mayors elected last month two were incumbents 
two were state senators two had long experience on city councils 
in their political experience and their coalition approach 
wilder and dinkins represent a growing trend among black 
politicians said dr cheryl miller a visiting scholar at the 
joint center an increasing number of them are becoming viable 
candidates for top positions by climbing the conventional political 
ladder 
young came to politics from the civil rights movement after 
serving as an aide to the rev martin luther king jr he was 
elected to congress became us ambassador to the united nations 
and has served two terms as mayor of atlanta 
another thread is the course the analysts called 
deracialization playing down what are seen as black issues in 
favor of themes that appeal to a broader constituency 
dr charles jones of old dominion university in norfolk va 
said the wilder campaign was designed around issues without racial 
implications he ran as a centrist gaining vital votes for his 
support of abortion rights while at the same time advocating a 
balanced budget supporting the death penalty and backing 
virginias right to work law 
for dinkins the issues were different but the style was 
similar campaign aide hulbert james said 
both candidates kept their distance from jesse jackson during 
the fall campaign although james said the political structure and 
cadre built for jacksons 1988 presidential primary campaign was 
essential to the dinkins organization 
james who also worked for jackson counseled against 
deemphasizing the black vote in the process of reaching out to 
white voters 
thats a challenge for any politician trying to broaden his base 
by reaching out for new supporters without ignoring or offending 
old ones especially for a black candidate seeking a breakthrough 
to white voters 
in his effort to turn out black voters in virginia wilder 
appeared each sunday in seven to 10 black churches campaign visits 
he made with as little fanfare as possible jones said 
as young begins his race for governor of georgia there are 
parallels in both issues and strategy race obviously will be a 
factor but it wont be an issue in the young campaign he is 
telling voters he can bring to georgia the kind of progress in 
economic development atlanta has seen in the past eight years his 
emphasis is on experience qualifications and his record in office 
young boasts of his support in the atlanta business community 
his campaign chairman is griffin bell the former attorney general 
a white conservative democrat hobby stripling the former mayor 
of vienna ga once president of the georgia municipal 
association is to manage his campaign 
young promises to go anywhere and talk to anyone to get his 
message across as if to demonstrate he dined one night last month 
at a redneck cafe in marietta for the occasion the owner a 
supporter took two racist records off the jukebox 
youngs recognition and approval ratings give him an early edge 
in what is likely to be a fiveway democratic primary next year 
but he faces a major obstacle that did not confront wilder the 
likelihood of a runoff primary 
just under a quarter of georgias voting age population is 
black young is a skilled and attractive campaigner theres a good 
chance he will get more votes than any other democrat in the 
primary but the crowded ballot would make it unlikely any 
candidate could gain the 50 percentplus that is needed for 
nomination without a runoff and in a twoway deep south race 
against a white candidate the odds would be tougher win that and 
hed have to do it again next november against a white republican 
and if a centrist black candidate loses next time 
howard universitys mccormick had an answer 
one thing thats going to happen is jesse jacksons going to 
say i told you so

as the 1980s dawned communism was on the march 
again this time on the backs of soviet soldiers entering 
afghanistan andrei d sakharov was on his way to exile for saying 
it was wrong 
as the decade closes the red tide that lenin dreamed would 
cover the world appeared to be receding some even said that 72 
years after the bolshevik revolution the dream already had died 
despite the determined efforts of a peasants son from southern 
russia to remake it for the 1990s 
in the 1980s years of official lies brutality empty store 
shelves and mindboggling inefficiency caught up with the soviet 
union and then with its allies promising paradise for the laboring 
masses sovietstyle socialism could not save three out of four 
potatoes from rotting before they reached the plate meanwhile the 
west prospered 
mikhail s gorbachevs selection as soviet communist party chief 
on march 11 1985 divided the decade between the cozy downward 
spiral of leonid i brezhnev and his proteges and a revolution in 
the revolution 
gorbachev exorcised from soviet hearts the terror of the 
midnight knock on the door he declared afghanistan and materialism the 
ideology could not exploit that world view for the good of the 
working man 
lenins revolution said boris pestov a 23yearold moscow 
worker was just a seizure of power by one party the bolsheviks 
and nobody else needed it 
a east german man watched police beat people trying to jump 
aboard a train to west germany i saw them beat children he 
said that was when my wife and i decided to leave 
british communist martin jacques said the system that regarded 
itself as the deepest expression of the laws of history had been 
overtaken by history 
defenders of the system claimed that it could be reformed i 
dont think socialism is kaput said egon krenz named in 
midoctober 1989 to reform east germany i think the 
disfigurements of socialism are kaput 
but several weeks later krenz himself was kaput swept away by 
the party on the same day it expelled honecker 
alexander dubcek the czechoslovak communist leader whose 
reforms were crushed by soviet tanks in 1968 could stand before a 
halfmillion people on pragues wenceslas square 21 years later and 
proclaim the ideals of democracy freedom and humanity live on 
gorbachev acknowledged the events of the 1980s as the fruit of 
communisms stormy history 
our past defies a simple straightforward interpretation 
the soviet leader said but he conceded this country has failed 
to create for its people the conditions of life which are natural 
for a civilized state 
a few soviet politicians proposed the heretical to remove 
lenins body from its red square mausoelum and bury it but 
gorbachev kept faith in the dynamism of leninism to direct the 
world on a new path of using the scientific revolution for the 
benefit of all 
the idea of socialism as we understand it today is above all 
the idea of freedom he said 
his foreign minister and close adviser eduard a shevardnadze 
said the era of worldwide struggle with capitalism was over 
as for the question of which of the two existing social 
systems will prove to be the best in giving people greater 
freedom and wellbeing he said let us leave that for future 
generations to decide

it was the great untold story of the 1980s or was it in the 
newspaper every day 
suddenly an unusual number of people in their prime were dying 
after a long illness their obituaries often said 
though frequently written with respect for personal or family 
wishes the vague death notices deflected early public attention 
from a toll that would mount to almost 70000 americans victims of 
a virus discovered only in 1983 that infected an estimated 6 
million to 8 million people worldwide by the end of the 80s 
halfway through the decade the death of movie star rock hudson 
personalized for many americans what had been a faceless plague 
seemingly limited to risk groups of homosexual men 
hemophiliacs and intravenous drug users 
by then the infections and cancers that could drastically 
shorten the lives of those infected with the virus had a name 
acquired immune deficiency syndrome aids 
quickly other wellknown names in the arts and public life were 
drawn into the patchwork of torn lives symbolized by an immense 
quilt spread in front of the washington monument 
just as the quilt has grown too large to be shipped around the 
country for display the roster of the dead can only be represented 
symbolically by this short list

as americans wend their way through the season of 
holiday goodies and then decide what diet to choose for the new 
year they face a smorgasbord of scientific updates and debate over 
cholesterol 
a 2yearold government campaign to get people interested in 
knowing how much of the fatty substance is in their arteries has 
made cholesterol a popular topic from cocktail parties to 
medicalscreening booths in shopping malls 
researchers are releasing new studies detailing how excess 
cholesterol an essential building block of cell membranes sex 
hormones and vitamin d in the blood clogs vessels and causes 
heart attacks 
food manufacturers are devising new products to capitalize on 
the findings splashing cholesterolfree banners across items 
ranging from cupcakes to peanut butter which never contained 
cholesterol anyway 
news media have kept the publics curiosity piqued with the 
views of a small but vocal group of critics including scientists 
they say the public is being frightened needlessly many people 
wont benefit from the lowcholesterol diets and money is wasted 
to try to get america to change the way it eats 
how bad is cholesterol how hard should people work to avoid it 
and how much will that help increase their chances of living longer 
researchers have spent hundreds of millions of federal dollars 
trying to answer those questions many top scientists are convinced 
of the results 
the evidence linking elevated blood cholesterol to coronary 
heart disease is overwhelming a group of them said recently in a 
statement by the american heart association and the national heart 
lung and blood institute 
population studies clinical trials genetic tests and animal 
experiments show that high levels of blood cholesterol clog 
arteries and increase the risk of heart disease they said adding 
clinical trials show lowering cholesterol levels by diet or drugs 
decreases subsequent occurrence of heart disease 
the direct evidence is strongest in middleaged men with 
high initial cholesterol levels but also strongly suggests 
cutting cholesterol is likely to decrease coronary heart disease 
incidence in younger and older men in women and in persons with 
more moderate cholesterol levels they said 
two of the largest studies to date suggest that a 1 percent 
reduction in blood cholesterol translates into a 2 percent 
reduction in the risk of developing coronary heart disease they 
added 
those studies the coronary primary prevention trial involving 
more than 3800 middleaged men and the framingham heart study of 
over 5000 women and men have been supported by others suggesting 
greater benefit they said 
however critics of the anticholesterol campaign contend it has 
misled people by excluding mention of other major contributors to 
heart disease americas no 1 killer which claims more than 
500000 lives a year 
one critic dr robert e olson professor of medicine and 
pharmacological science at the state university of new york at 
stony brook says only about 20 percent of a persons heartdisease 
risk is attributable to blood cholesterol 
an estimated 40 percent is hereditary and the rest is due to 
other causes chiefly smoking and high blood pressure he said 
we think theres too much hype in the marketplace and even in 
these educational agencies everybodys sort of afraid of their 
food and afraid of their cholesterol often without medical 
surveillance 
dr fredrick j stare harvard nutrition professor emeritus and 
coauthor of balanced nutrition beyond the cholesterol scare 
agrees we dont think the national cholesterol education program 
gives enough attention to other risk factors that are more 
important smoking high blood pressure obesity diabetes lack 
of a reasonable amount of activity and stress 
dr eliot corday of los angeles past president of the american 
college of cardiology said he objects to cholesterollowering 
efforts for people over 65 
over 65 theres no proof theres any benefit said corday 
formerly a member of the advisory council to the national heart 
lung and blood institute where he felt very very outnumbered 
by ardent cholesterol opponents 
elderly patients try very hard not to touch a bit of 
cholesterol corday said even though its a damn fool thing to 
stop eating eggs and meat when they need the nutrition they get 
anemic 
the british royal college of physicians recommended in february 
that checking family histories for heart attacks is more important 
than cholesterol testing said victor herbert professor of 
medicine at new yorks mount sinai hospital i agree with them 
if a lot of people in the family didnt have heart attacks youre 
not going to have one 
cholesterol testing becomes appropriate if the family history 
suggests a genetic tendency to heart attack he said 
cholesterolmodifying efforts should begin only if blood levels are 
high for socalled bad cholesterol ldl or lowdensity 
lipoprotein and low for socalled good cholesterol hdl or 
highdensity lipoprotein 
olson corday and herbert were on a panel assembled in september 
by the council on science and health a consumer education group 
partly funded by the food industry to offset what they call the 
cholesterol scare 
part of their message was that only 15 percent of the population 
have bloodcholesterol levels putting them clearly at greater risk 
for heart attacks 
that level is generally agreed to be 240 milligrams per 
deciliter of blood and people testing that high should be seeing 
a physician they should not be selfmedicating themselves with 
diet changes said elizabeth m whelan the councils president 
besides lowering cholesterol dietarily is difficult at best and 
impossible for many not everyone responds the same way 
confusion also prevails about what to modify in the diet with 
undue emphasis placed on cholesterol herbert said we make three 
times as much cholesterol from dietary fat as from dietary 
cholesterol too much dietary cholesterol is not the culprit too 
much saturated fat is the culprit 
dr john c larosa chairman of the task force on cholesterol 
issues for the american heart association says critics are not 
really saying anything different from the government scientists 
their guidelines are unchanged since being introduced two years 
ago as part of the national cholesterol education program which 
recommends that all adults learn their bloodcholesterol level and 
aim for a level below 200 milligrams per deciliter of blood those 
with levels of 200239 are considered borderline high not 
requiring treatment unless they have two other traits that increase 
their risk for heart disease including hereditary tendency and 
being male 
people who head for shopping malls or other public places to get 
their cholesterol checked should be wary though the department of 
health and human services said last month that such screenings can 
be inaccurate pose health risks and frequently fail to provide 
counseling or physician referral 
those with confirmed levels of 240 or above are at high risk and 
should get hdl and ldl testing if warranted treatment should 
begin with diet and exercise and should proceed to drugs only if 
that approach fails 
the scientific basis for the guidelines is probably more solid 
than for any public health venture that i know of said dr 
daniel steinberg a professor of medicine at the university of 
california at san diego 
steinberg was chairman of the federal 1984 concensus development 
conference panel that gave rise to the assault on cholesterol 
it has been tremendously effective in bringing in people who 
have been previously unwilling to listen to lifestyle 
modifications said dr nancy dickey of richmond texas an 
american medical association board member 
seventeen european nations in 1987 reached the same conclusions 
as the us panel and the canadians did so later steinberg said 
this is not sort of an offthewall conclusion by americans who 
are gungho against cholesterol

leaving nature to repair itself wont 
counter the damage caused by people say park managers hoping to 
restore the grassy marshes and hardwood hammocks of the everglades 
to their turnofthecentury condition 
if nature were allowed to take its course in everglades national 
park the hardy melaleuca tree an australian invader could take 
over and displace every native plant already the condition in 
some tracts near the parks borders 
proponents of restoration ecology call it the park management 
philosophy of the future and say park managers abdicated their 
responsibility when they left yellowstone national park for 
example to recover from fires that damaged more than twofifths of 
the 22 millionacre park 
basically theyre doing nothing said thomas bonnicksen a 
texas aampm professor who recently lectured to a group of everglades 
scientists by and large theyre standing back and proclaiming 
every little blade of grass that comes up a masterpiece of gods 
work 
restoration is nothing more than looking back at what we had 
when we set the areas aside he said in many cases 
particularly in north america the national parks resemble very 
little what they were when they were set aside 
our goal is to replace and increase the biological diversity 
on this planet that weve lost and we are convinced that simply 
declaring places as reserves putting fences around them and 
standing back and watching them is going to lead to a reduction in 
biological diversity because the areas around the preserve are 
ignored and the areas in the preserve are degraded 
the national park service sees a lot of value in some of the 
principles of ecological restoration said spokesman duncan 
morrow in washington 
for example the agency is trying to eject some unwanted 
nonnative animals notably burros in the grand canyon and death 
valley and european wild boar in the great smoky mountains morrow 
said some of the major intrusions which seem to be susceptible 
to management we have already undertaken to remove others we are 
looking at finding ways that might work 
youd have to temper what seem to be desirable goals with some 
sense of what can in fact be accomplished 
restoration ecology is practiced most commonly on a small scale 
on grasslands wetlands lakes and forest tracts but the canadian 
park service adopted the concept for its sprawling banff national 
park said bonnicksen a director of the 1200member 18monthold 
society for ecological restoration 
in choosing a target date as a guide to what a restored park 
should look like 1900 has been a common reference point for the 
everglades 
what is it that we really want to do until we can put this 
down straight in our minds were going to flounder said george 
gannmatzen who grew up on the edge of the everglades worked in 
the park and now is a consulting restoration ecologist 
tree ring studies soil chemistry old photographs historic 
land surveys an analysis of pollen and charcoal fragments in pond 
sediment and other methods offer clues to the type and prevalence 
of vegetation at a given point in time 
restoration work can involve anything from planting vegetation 
that was known to be in a disturbed area at the benchmark date to 
managing lightning fires to leave a historic blend of trees 
at the everglades hydrologists tinkering with water delivery 
for 10 years have been trying to recreate a natural 
rainfalldriven system they hope will bring wading birds 
alligators panthers deer and fish to old haunts 
its a tradeoff the alligator prefers deeper water conditions 
than the wading bird said bob johnson the parks hydrologic 
program manager the idea is to come up with some range of 
hydrologic conditions 
the nature conservancy estimates a minimum 10 per acre for 
minor restoration gannmatzen said his firm charges 100 per 
acre and highly disturbed areas cost 10000 to 15000 an acre to 
reach a maintenance condition which then requires regular followup 
restoration may be more attractive in the everglades than other 
parks because the signs of trouble a stunning drop in wading 
birds and threats to numerous animal and plant species are 
obvious bonnicksen said the changes that take place in the 
forest are not as easily seen by the untrained eye as the changes 
that take place in a place like the everglades 
if restoration ecology is pursued in the everglades he said 
it may in fact turn out to be the first national park that 
actually is managed to restore its historic integrity and it may 
serve as a model for other national parks

behind the security gates at oak ridge 
national laboratory researchers are quietly preparing for an 
invasion theyve come up with one device to tell friend from foe 
and another to track the enemy 
the invaders began their advance about 40 years ago and now are 
massing in mexico for a final assault expected some time next year 
no need to hustle down to the gun shop these invaders are 
aggressive africanized bees sometimes known as killer bees 
because they have killed animals and people theyve also disrupted 
honeybee colonies 
researchers at the federal laboratory here have developed a 
handheld sensor that can distinguish between the tamer domestic 
honeybees and their more aggressive cousins and a prototype of a 
device to track the africanized bees using a solarpowered 
infaredpulsating microchip bee backpack 
neither device falls directly into the work done by the nuclear 
engineers and electronics specialists at the us department of 
energy lab but they were intrigued by parallels with their work in 
connection with radiation monitoring 
the 339 noise sensor dubbed a buzz buster is ready for 
market said engineer howard kerr who developed it largely in his 
spare time ive been to venezuela twice and mexico once with 
this thing and it works like a top 
kerr an amateur beekeeper got started a few years ago when 
told by a federal agricultural official that for some unexplained 
reason the africanized bees that were released from a brazilian lab 
make a louder sound in flight 
the resulting buzz buster allows monitoring of a bee colony from 
a distance to determine whether there are any africanized bees 
buzzing inside 
while working on the buzz buster ker called in chip taylor a 
university of kansas bee expert who said what researchers needed 
was a way to track bees particularly during mating that sparked 
the idea for the microchip backpack 
after a year of research and 100000 in seed money from the 
lab gary alleys team has developed a transmitter about onefourth 
the size of a postage stamp that sends an infrared beam more than a 
1 kilometer an 8inch telescope with a special sensor detects the 
beam which cant be seen by the naked eye 
alley allows that the transmitter at about 65 milligrams is 
still 15 milligrams too heavy for a bee to carry and work on a 
computerized tracking system hasnt even begun but i think we 
have proven the concept he said there are certainly some 
refinements that need to be made but i think the concept is 
feasible 
today i couldnt give you a field demonstration of putting 
one on a bee but several major hurdles have been crossed 
but he said the hardest work has already been done and the main 
job now is to get more funding to carry on 
weve gotten interest from a broad spectrum of agencies none 
of whom are interested in honeybees kerr lamented theres a 
lot of things that people would like to be able to track with a 
very inconspicuous transmitter attached to it 
nasa thinks the transmitters might be used for equipment 
inventories aboard spacecraft and there have been inquiries from 
people who would like to use the microchip to track animals birds 
and insects alley said 
there also has been interest from the defense department and 
how would you characterize it the fbi he said 
even if the transmitter isnt ready by the time the africanized 
bees reach the united states taylor said it will be developed 
eventually because of the number of possible applications this 
is a technology that has to come along if it doesnt come along 
right now its got to come along in the future

a computerized process to sharpen blurry 
photos by breaking them into millions of pieces and reassembling 
them could be a boon not only to family albums but also to police 
who use photographs to solve crimes 
state police used a murat tekalps process when they 
investigated the death of a 7yearold boy who was struck by a 
vehicle while he was camping out on a hill behind his home the 
only evidence was a faint trace of tire marks on the boys tent 
police clarified the photographs and concluded that the boy was 
struck by his fathers pickup truck the case has not gone to 
trial but state police investigator james booth said the process 
was essential 
there are dozens of scenarios in which it could be used 
such as photographs of license plates documents and vehicles said 
gerald b richards chief of the fbis special photographic unit in 
washington if youve got one big case it works on its 
golden he said 
tekalp a university of rochester electrical engineering 
professor has only developed the process for still photographs 
but he said moving pictures are his next subject the computer 
process uses a highresolution scanner to divide a negative into 
more than 2 million pixels calculations then are made about what 
caused the blur the computer sorts the information and produces a 
clearer image and then a new negative is made

nitric and sulfuric acids in rain are 
killing mountain forests in the east by damaging the foliage 
crippling photosynthesis and by upsetting trees nutritional 
balance a researcher says 
this finding is a surprise because sulfuric acid from acid 
rain was shown in previous studies to be harmless to crop plants 
said jay s jacobson who based his findings on five years of field 
and greenhouse experiments 
we have demonstrated that sulfuric acid at concentrations 
similar to those found in acidic mist and cloudwater seriously 
weakens the foliage thus impairing the trees photosynthetic 
process at high concentrations it kills the needles outright 
said jacobson a plant physiologist at cornell universitys boyce 
thompson institute for plant research 
while sulfuric acid destroyed the foliage nitric acid a form 
of nitrogen fertilizer upset the trees balance of nutrients he 
said all plants need nutrients from the soil to grow if we give 
them too much of one nutrient such as nitrogen fertilizer from the 
atmosphere and not enough of others the trees would develop chronic 
nutritional deficiencies a factor detrimental to the health of the 
affected tree in the long run 
scientists have long suspected that acid precipitation has been 
the cause of mountain forest decline red spruce which grow at 
high elevations across the northeast are important for the pulp 
and paper industries 
sulfuric acid is formed in the atmosphere when sulfur oxides 
from the combustion of coal and oil undergo chemical reactions 
nitric acid is produced by internal combustion engines and from the 
combustion of oil and coal 
jacobsons findings will be published next year in the canadian 
journal of forest research the water air and soil pollution 
journal and physiologia plantarum in sweden

when charles wagner pulled a whopper 
rainbow trout from the elkhorn river last summer his staterecord 
catch spawned an idea 
officials marveled that the 11pound 3ounce beauty thrived in 
springwater fed in part by an abandoned coal mine and want to make 
it a fish hatchery 
trout are extremely fragile said ed hamrick director of 
the state department of natural resources they need so many 
factors in order for them to perpetuate themselves naturally 
most people when they think of a coal mine dont think of a 
hatchery said don phares state assistant chief of cold water 
fisheries 
good sites for trout hatcheries are hard to find because many 
count on natural springs for water phares said he and us rep 
nick rahall dwva chairman of the house mining and natural 
resources subcommittee insist water conditions at some old coal 
mines are just right to produce the big ones 
water draining from coal mines is usually very acid because of 
the residue of highsulfur coal the mine that feeds the elkhorn 
was always low in sulfur 
phares and rahall refused to name the mine or give its location 
until it can be purchased congress will take up the project next 
year it must approve 25 million to buy the mine and build the 
hatchery 
the us fish and wildlife service and state department of 
natural resources would build the hatchery with a series of 
concrete runways eight feet wide by 100 long to produce up to 
200000 fish a year phares said the mine drainage would be 
recirculated with some outside water added for volume 
the prototype hatchery could spawn new life for many old mines 
said jim zoia staff director of the house subcommittee theres 
a lot of potential in the appalachian area 
ed hayne jr of charleston vice president of west virginias 
southern chapter of trout unlimited said there are high hopes for 
the hatchery being a big trout fisherman i think its needed 
and it could very well turn out to be a big economic boost to

consumer confidence in the economy fell in 
november but remains relatively strong the conference board said 
a survey of 5000 households nationwide showed that buying plans 
for houses and cars are soft and that americans are slightly less 
optimistic about their expectations for the economy in the coming 
months 
the conference boards consumer confidence index released 
wednesday registered 1144 for november the lowest since november 
1988 
twentysix percent of survey participants said current business 
conditions are good down from 28 percent in october and the lowest 
level in more than a year but the percentage who thought the 
economy was bad also fell to 153 percent from 169 percent 
respondents outlook for economic conditions six months from now

campeau corp has sharply criticized a major creditrating 
company for reportedly telling wholesalers to stop shipping 
merchandise to campeaus department stores an action that could 
do severe damage to the chains 
the criticism came in a letter wednesday from campeau executive 
russell s davis to dun amp bradstreet corps chairman and chief 
executive officer charles moritz a copy of the letter which was 
dispatched in response to a new york times article was made public 
by torontobased campeau 
the new york times reported in wednesday editions that dun amp 
bradstreet had informed its clients that it no longer was advising 
them to ship goods to retailers owned by the canadian retail and 
property company 
the newspaper quoted dun amp bradstreet spokesman bill doscher as 
saying the company is no longer providing guidelines on shipments 
to the campeau stores to our clients he declined to elaborate 
the times said 
calls late wednesday seeking comment from dun amp bradstreet 
werent immediately returned 
goods for the peak holiday shopping season are already stocked 
in campeaus 140 stores around the country including 
bloomingdales burdines goldsmithss jordan marsh lazarus and 
richs 
but if manufacturers hold back on further shipments of clothing 
home furnishings and other items campeauowned stores could be 
short of spring merchandise 
previously dun amp bradstreet advised manufacturers that they 
could sell each of campeaus federated department stores inc and 
allied stores corp divisions as much as 250000 worth of 
merchandise at wholesale cost 
but the times said dun amp bradstreet informed manufacturers by 
telephone on tuesday that campeaus financial situation looked 
bleak because it hadnt received any formal bids for 
bloomingdales the 17store upscale chain that campeau has put up 
for sale to generate muchneeded cash 
dun amp bradstreet also reportedly mentioned the interest payments 
campeau owes early next year on its heavy debts as a reason for 
concern 
davis chief financial officer of federated and allied said dun 
amp bradstreets advisory was based on wholly inaccurate and 
misleading information information that has the potential for 
doing considerable harm to our business 
he said dun amp bradstreet should have contacted campeau to get 
the facts before altering its position 
davis said campeau suppliers so far have been very supportive 
despite a preponderance of market rumors and the uncertainty 
created by the spread of misinformation 
the actions reportedly taken by dun amp bradstreet are 
professionally irresponsible and entirely inexcusable he said 
plans for the sale of bloomingdales are on schedule he said 
friday is the deadline by which initial bids must be submitted and 
davis said campeau has received expressions of interest from 
numerous parties 
in fact the process for the sale of bloomingdales is moving 
along exactly on schedule davis said in the letter 
further we have every reason to believe that the sale of 
bloomingdales will be concluded satisfactorily and within the 
publicly stated timeframe which anticipates definitive action in 
the early part of next year he said 
the head of bloomingdales marvin s traub has said he would 
like to lead a buyout of the chain but there hasnt been any 
indication that he has secured adequate financial support for his 
plan 
traub traveled to tokyo last week and said he had serious 
constructive conversations with parties that may join in a 
possible buyout 
another party that has publicly disclosed an interest in 
bloomingdales is crown american corp a privately held company 
that is one of the countrys major shopping mall developers and 
owns the hesss department store chain

the united states spent nearly 6 billion from 
august through october to stem the dollars rise and keep the 
currency in the trading range set with other major industrialized 
nations the federal reserve reported 
the quarterly foreignexchange report released wednesday by the 
federal reserve bank of new york showed the fed and the treasury 
sold 5871 billion in exchange for west german marks and japanese 
yen during the three months ended oct 31 
the new york fed said the government sold a total of 3289 
billion for japanese yen and 2582 billion for west german marks 
the move the governments secondlargest unloading of dollars 
ever in a threemonth period comes on the heels of the 
recordsetting sale of 1192 billion in the quarter ended july 31 
the dollar initially got a boost during the augustoctober 
quarter from a spate of favorable economic data because of the 
figures which indicated the economy was not as sluggish as 
previously believed the federal reserve was not inclined to push 
interest rates lower which kept returns relatively attractive on 
dollardenominated securities 
gains in retail sales and employment and a betterthanexpected 
trade report helped boost the dollar to its high during the period 
of 200 west german marks and 14898 japanese yen on sept 15 
but a meeting of the group of seven industrial nations in 
washington later that month produced a sharply worded statement 
criticizing the dollars rise the group which includes the 
united states britain west germany japan canada italy and 
france favors a relatively weaker dollar which is seen as 
helping reduce the huge us trade deficit 
the group of seven called the dollars rise inconsistent with 
longrun fundamentals and said a further rise could adversely 
affect prospects for the world economy 
the bulk of the feds intervention which was coordinated with 
other leading central banks occurred in the weeks leading up to 
the g7 meeting and in several weeks following the gathering 
activities after the g7 meeting were forceful said sam 
y cross a new york fed executive vice president who presented the 
report to reporters we did act quite forcefully to reinforce the 
policy statement of the group 
since that time the dollar has trended downward cross said 
by early october the dollar had plunged to 18650 west german 
marks and 13860 japanese yen 
by midoctober the upward pressure on the dollar had fully 
eased interest rates in europe and in japan traditionally far 
lower than us rates were higher thereby shrinking the 
advantage the united states had in terms of return to investors and 
reducing demand for dollars 
furthermore more recent reports indicated sluggishness in the 
us economy that raised speculation the federal reserve might ease 
credit to help prevent a recession 
the spotlight shifted to foreign currencies particularly the 
mark which was bolstered by west germanys bright economic 
prospects and the beginnings of a massive reform movement in 
eastern europe 
the dollar now is trading at about 176177 marks and 143144 
yen 
currency traders are often keenly aware of the activities of 
central banks in the open markets but the feds policy is to 
comment only well after the fact the fed does not provide any data 
on intervention by foreign central banks

publishing and information services giant 
mcgrawhill inc is trimming more than 1000 jobs or 7 percent of 
its fulltime positions and taking a big charge against its 
earnings in a costcutting realignment 
but wall streeters sent the companys stock lower wednesday in 
what analysts said reflected disappointment with the companys 
earnings projections for 1990 despite the cutbacks 
in new york stock exchange trading mcgrawhill closed down 2 a 
share at 6150 
chairman joseph l dionne said next years earnings excluding 
nonrecurring gains would be within a range of 350 to 4 a share 
even after the the job eliminations and 152 million in charges 
after taxes in the fourth quarter last year mcgrawhill earned 
383 a share 
bruce thorp a media analyst for provident national bank in 
philadelphia called the costcutting move one of the more 
decisive things mcgrawhill has done but he said the earnings 
projection surprised analysts 
its a sign that business isnt really good he said 
bert boksen who follows mcgrawhill for raymond james amp 
associates in st petersburg fla said the outlook was a lot 
worse than anybody expected it indicates a softerthanexpected 
outlook for the school publishing business and a general slowing of 
the economy he said 
the company did not specify where the job eliminations would be 
but indicated many would be corporate positions rather than in 
operating units which include business week magazine and standard 
amp poors debt rating service 
the effort to improve productivity and make the organization 
leaner is a step in the right direction said peter appert a 
media analyst for cj lawrence morgan grenfell inc but he said 
the company should do more 
operating margins in some of their units are low by industry 
standards appert said citing tv station operations and some 
information services units 
he said the stock markets negative reaction to the announcement 
would do nothing to discourage speculation that the company may be 
a takeover target 
mcgrawhill said it would deduct 220 million from its pretax 
earnings or 152 million after taxes in the fourth quarter for 
writing down the value of assets including those at its 
drimcgrawhill economic forecasting unit the charge also reflects 
the closing of a unit that publishes generalinterest books and the 
establishment of a reserve for employee severance payments 
several publishing companies recently have taken writedowns 
including harcourt brace jovanovich inc and paramount 
communications inc which owns simon amp schuster 
in addition time warner inc recently agreed to sell its scott 
foresman amp co textbook division for less than it paid for it three 
years ago and expects to take a pretax charge of 175 million on 
the deal 
mcgrawhill said it would scrap its current internal structure 
of three operating companies publishing financial services and 
information services and have all operations report to two new 
corporate executive vice presidents responsible to dionne 
one new executive vice president is harold w mcgraw iii 
greatgrandson of the companys founder mcgraw is in charge of 
overseeing the financial services business week and broadcasting 
groups and the aerospace and defense information units he had been 
head of financial services 
the other walter d serwatka will be responsible for divisions 
that provide information on the construction industry education 
law computers and communications he also will oversee the 
professional publishing group he had headed information services 
adopting this streamlined corporate structure eliminates an 
entire layer of staffing and related expenses associated with the 
three operating companies dionne said in a statement 
the rest of the jobs being eliminated will result from 
previously disclosed plans to automate delivery of the fw dodge 
group reports on the construction industry and from corporate staff 
reductions spokesman stewart trisler said 
mcgrawhill employs about 13700 people meaning the reductions 
would amount to a 7 percent cut in staffing 
the company earned 5497 million or 113 a share on revenue 
of 5074 million in the fourth quarter of 1988 it earned 1855 
million or 383 a share on revenue of 182 billion for all of 
1988

us economic activity ranged from stable to 
expanding modestly last month although the manufacturing sector 
showed signs of weakness the federal reserve board said in a 
report that provided no damaging news about inflation 
in its latest survey of economic conditions the central bank 
said wednesday that only two of its 12 districts showed some 
recent softening in the economy the districts were not named 
but summaries provided by the fed indicated they were the ones 
based in richmond va and st louis 
consumer spending has varied among districts the survey 
showed strength has been mostly confined to nondurable items 
while sales of autos and other durables have generally been weak 
higher interest rates have dampened sales of durable goods 
bigticket items expected to last more than three years because 
such items often are financed through borrowing 
the majority of districts report some softening in 
manufacturing activity but there are pockets of strength the fed 
said construction is strong or improving in the west and midwest 
but somewhat sluggish in other areas 
referring to inflation the report said those districts that 
reported on price developments generally noted flat to modestly 
increased input prices with several mentioning the continuing 
escalation of medical insurance costs 
the survey by the 12 district banks was conducted prior to nov 
28 in preparation for the dec 18 meeting of the federal open 
market committee 
as the central banks monetary policysetting arm the committee 
sets goals for monetary growth which in turn govern interest rates 
it was the tighter monetary policies that pushed up interest rates 
recently as the fed sought to restrain inflation 
the manufacturing and housing industries were most affected by 
the tightmoney policies although the fed has eased its grip 
recently and the housing industry has picked up as mortgage rates 
fell 
retail sales were described as on target or healthy in the new 
york st louis minneapolis and san francisco districts and 
unchanged in boston cleveland and philadelphia richmond and 
dallas noted some softening 
some slowing in manufacturing activity has occurred in most 
areas the survey showed weakness in the auto industry and 
among its suppliers was the most commonly cited as a major factor 
in the manufacturing slowdown 
the fed survey showed agriculture improving in much of the 
country although drought was reported in south texas and along the 
gulf coast 
it also reported increased natural gas exploration in the kansas 
city district and said the oil and gas industry is optimistic about 
expanding in the dallas district next year 
loan demand at commercial banks the survey said varied by type 
and region 
the san francisco region hit by the strong earthquake in 
october reports strong loan demand in most areas though the rate 
of growth seems to have slowed from its earlier robust pace the 
fed reported

the federal exportimport bank says it is 
willing to protect private banks against political violence and 
other risks in countries where they make loans to support purchases 
of us goods 
the bank did not specify any countries in its announcement 
wednesday the new guarantee could be given to lenders to the 
soviet union and other east european countries if as many business 
people hope laws are repealed that limit us aid to those nations 
in the past the bank required the borrowing government to make 
a guarantee against financial loss from violence and foreign 
government actions when the money was lent over five years or more 
for a government purchase private projects required a guarantee 
from a private bank in the borrowing country on loans made for 
less than five years the exportimport bank has sometimes covered 
political risks 
on tuesday the bank told its advisory committee that there have 
been several requests that it take over the longterm political 
guarantee john d macomber the banks president said he expected 
there will be many more such requests in the future 
ann frey a press officer at the bank explained that this was 
because projects in some countries that had been delayed by 
international debt problems are now being brought up again foreign 
governments are unwilling to take on the risk of additional debt 
themselves she suggested 
she said requests for the new us guarantees have come from 
turkey and some latin american countries 
an exportimport bank guarantee often makes the difference in 
closing a deal other governments of industrial countries 
especially france and japan compete vigorously for international 
orders 
political risks include war rebellion confiscation 
nationalization and the refusal of a foreign government to allow 
payments to leave its country the bank said the new longterm 
guarantees will be available after the us government and the 
borrowing government have made an agreement that provides a way to 
settle disputes 
the us governments overseas private investment corporation 
already offers similar insurance to americans who make direct 
investments not loans in other countries some governments 
especially in latin america have been reluctant to make agreements 
on dispute settlement because they are unwilling to see trade 
disputes handled anywhere but in their own courts

an extensive financial investigation of eastern 
airlines being made under the supervision of a federal bankruptcy 
court has raised objections from the airline 
david boies an attorney for eastern told us bankruptcy judge 
burton r lifland at a hearing wednesday that the investigations 
objectivity has been compromised because a large part of the work 
has been delegated to easterns unions 
attorney david i shapiro the examiner appointed by the 
bankruptcy court has been conducting the inquiry into eastern 
continental airlines and their parent texas air corp since early 
september shapiro and more than 20 associates have been 
interviewing current and former officers of the companies union 
leaders and others 
shapiro told lifland he has received a list of complaints from 
boies which contend among other things that the investigation has 
been too tough and too prosecutorial the examiner said the 
magnitude of the task has led him to delegate some work such as 
interviews to union attorneys but that practice hasnt hurt 
objectivity 
also at the hearing lifland postponed for two months 
consideration of a union request for a special trustee to be 
appointed to run miamibased eastern 
lifland postponed from dec 15 to feb 15 a hearing on the 
trustee issue in accordance with a request by shapiro he also 
gave shapiro until feb 15 to submit a report on his investigation 
its clear that the underlying examinations are proceeding 
with vigor with a great deal of discomfort lifland said 
the unions at eastern had asked that a trustee be appointed to 
run the airline in place of current management soon after they went 
on strike on march 4 lifland has postponed hearings on the 
question several times since then 
union attorneys objected wednesday to shapiros request that the 
trustee issue be put off again but they agreed that he needed more 
time to complete his inquiry attorneys for easterns major 
creditors supported both of shapiros requests 
eastern filed for bankruptcy protection on march 9 and has been 
rebuilding as a smaller airline by hiring workers to replace the 
striking machinists pilots and flight attendants 
contract talks are ongoing between eastern and its pilots and 
flight attendants unions which decided to end their 8 12month 
sympathy strikes shortly before thanksgiving the machinists union 
is still on strike against the airline 
the unions have accused texas air chairman frank lorenzo of 
stripping assets from eastern 
shapiro is looking into past transactions between texas air 
eastern and sister carrier continental they include for example 
the transfer of the system one computer reservation system from 
eastern to texas air in april 1987 for about 100 million 
the key question is whether lorenzo has been treating the three 
companies as one airline shapiro told the court he and his staff 
have interviewed around 70 people and examined more than 200000 
documents he said 
in october shapiro had said he expected to complete the 
investigation by early december and said his schedule had been 
delayed several times by lawyers for the parties involved

while they are raising discount maxsaver fares the nations big 
airlines are softening the blow by eliminating advancepurchase 
requirements for the popular tickets during the holiday period 
following a move a week ago by pan am corp a number of 
airlines said wednesday they plan to raise maxsavers by 10 per 
round trip on flights of less than 1000 miles and 20 on longer 
trips the new fares take effect dec 16 
spokesmen for united airlines continental airlines eastern 
airlines delta air lines and northwest airlines said those 
carriers had decided after a week of deliberation to match pan ams 
increases 
most of the airlines also are following uniteds initiative in 
temporarily dropping advancepurchase requirements for the 
maxsavers the most deeply discounted fares popular with 
vacationers 
american airlines the nations largest carrier moved tuesday 
to match pan ams change 
americans new maxsaver fares between new york and los angeles 
for example will be 398 to 438 round trip up from 378 to 418 
fares between chicago and new york will go to 258 to 298 from 
248 to 288 
continental spokesman ned walker however emphasized that the 
airline was matching the maxsaver hikes only in selected markets 
passenger traffic normally increases this time of year a peak 
travel season the airlines have been under pressure to hike fares 
because their costs mainly fuel prices have increased sharply in 
recent months 
i dont think it was too much of a surprise given the way 
costs have been escalating said edward starkman an airline 
analyst at painewebber inc 
two weeks ago a number of big carriers led by united said they 
planned to raise fares on most domestic routes and eliminate 
discount fares used mainly by business travelers the increases 
didnt apply to the maxsavers however 
the airlines said wednesday they are waiving the usual 14day 
advancepurchase requirements for travel between dec 20 and jan 5 
when seats are available no refunds are allowed and passengers 
must buy tickets within 24 hours of making a reservation and must 
stay over a saturday night

cocacola classic was tops in 1989 but the 
drink known as new coke that was introduced to replace it in 1985 
fell out of the annual top 10 soft drink rankings for the first 
time an industry newsletter says 
the rankings released wednesday by beverage digest indicated new 
coke which had tied with rc cola and caffeinefree diet pepsi for 
10th place in 1988 failed to make the 10 top rankings this year 
publisher jesse meyers said caffeinefree diet pepsi broke the 
tie this year capturing 10th place with a 15 percent market share 
and leaving rc cola and new coke in a close fight for 11th at 14 
percent each 
the atlantabased cocacola co introduced new coke in 1985 
saying that it improved on the flavor of it regular cola but the 
company said fans of the original cocacola taste deluged the 
company with protests and the company put the original drink back 
on the market three months later as cocacola classic 
new coke was kept alive but its share of market rapidly fell to 
the low single digits after capturing an estimated 15 percent of 
1985 soft drink sales 
in 1989 cocacola classic retained the top ranking for the 
fourth consecutive year although its market share fell to 200 
percent from 201 percent in 1988 
pepsi was second at 183 percent down 04 percentage point from 
1988 
diet coke placed third with 89 percent share of market diet 
pepsi was fourth at 57 percent and dr pepper was fifth at 46 
percent according to beverage digest published from old 
greenwich conn 
filling out the rest of the top 10 list were sprite in sixth 
place at 36 percent followed by mountain dew at 35 percent 7up 
at 29 percent and caffeinefree diet coke at 24 percent 
the retail value of the soft drink market is 43 billion 
according to meyers that is up 2 percent from 1988 when sales 
rose 45 percent 
meyers said the slower growth was due to cooler weather in many 
parts of the nation this past summer a prime sales season for soft 
drinks 
he noted that the four diet soft drinks in the top 10 this year 
had combined market share growth of 17 percentage points while 
the six sugared products saw their combined market share fall 03 
percent 
we are watching our calories he said he said diet soft 
drinks are gaining ground in part because people like the taste and 
because the soft drink makers are offering diet drinks in more 
forms than ever 
counting all soft drinks sold by individual companies cocacola 
commanded the biggest corporate share of the industry in 1989 with 
411 percent up from 405 percent a year earlier the rankings 
indicated 
pepsicola was second in corporate share of the soft drink 
business with 311 percent up 04 percentage point from 1988 
dr pepperseven up ranks a distant third with a 10 percent 
corporate share of the market according to the beverage digest 
rankings cadbury beverages was fourth at 31 percent and royal 
crown was fifth at 28 percent

scott mcnealy president of sun 
microsystems inc is needling rival international business 
machines corp over its huge job cuts and said his computer company 
can take some of the credit for big blues woes 
mcnealy who introduced two important additions to suns sparc 
desktop computer family wednesday predicted a bright future for 
his 18 billion company in the 1990s despite problems elsewhere in 
the industry 
mcnealys uncharacteristic jabs at ibm and wall street traders 
came in response to questions about the effect on the computer 
industry of ibms announcement tuesday that it would cut 10000 
jobs in the united states and set aside 23 billion from its 
pretax profit to pay for the cuts 
asked in an interview wednesday whether mountain viewbased sun 
might make any cutbacks mcnealy quipped maybe we should and 
make the stock go up 
ibms stock rose 37 cents on tuesdays announcement but fell 
1 wednesday to 9862 
look at what the analysts did mcnealy said ibm made a 
statement yesterday that something is very wrong they laid off a 
whole sun microsystems worth of employees and they wrote off from 
profits more than we have in annual revenue and their stock went 
up 
thats a fundamental statement that we dont know what to do 
with our cash so we might as well pay it out in dividends which 
is what theyre doing 
their stock went up because analysts said ibm just washed 
all their dirty socks they took huge reserves and they padded 
their balance sheet and income statement massively so that theyre 
probably not going to have a bad quarter the next couple of 
quarters so ill get in ride it up then get out before they 
do the next one 
mcnealy noted that ibms moves were typical of many us 
companies 
there are lots of chief financial officers in industry who 
say when you take a bath take a big bath because that makes your 
stock price go up he said but is that any way to run a 
company i dont think so 
that type of thinking and the shortterm opportunities it 
provides traders on wall street he said results from the rules 
set by congress 
im not blaming the traders its the rules he said the 
answer he claims would be to impose heavy income taxes on profits 
from stock held less than a year or two 
mcnealy said he has long predicted that the type of workstation 
computers sun sells would cut into the sales of mainframe and 
minicomputer systems of companies like ibm 
workstations are powerful desktop computers that can be used for 
various applications such as spreadsheets word processing and 
database programming ibms mainframes and minicomputers are 
timeshared systems hooked to a large number of terminals and all 
the applications are handled by the main processor ibm also makes 
personal computers 
the three fastestgrowing computer companies of the 1980s 
mcnealy said were compaq computer corp apple computer inc and 
sun all of which are desktoporiented 
that growth came at the expense of the companies that get most 
of their profit from the bigger costlier computers such as ibm 
digital equipment corp unisys corp control data corp and amdahl 
corp wang laboratories inc and prime computer inc 
many industry analysts agree with mcnealys views 
its fair to say that companies like apple compaq sun 
microsoft and others can take appropriate credit for ibms 
decadelong problems said analyst peter rogers of the san 
francisco brokerage robertson stephens amp co 
whats basically happened at ibm is their technology is 
obsolete he said the model of computing on which they have 
built is no longer the preferred model 
suns latest entries into its sparc line are the powerful 
sparcserver 490 which is priced at 113900 with 32 megabytes of 
main memory and an entrylevel sparcserver 1 priced at 18900 
with 8 megabytes of main memory 
founded in 1982 sun has had only one quarter when it didnt 
show a profit sun lost 203 million in the fiscal fourth quarter

the former chairman of publishing giant 
macmillan inc and two current executives of the company have 
settled securities and exchange commission charges alleging they 
filed misleading documents 
the three edward p evans macmillans chairman from 1980 to 
1988 william f reilly macmillans chief operating officer and 
beverly c chell the publishers general counsel were accused of 
filing misleading or incomplete documents concerning the purpose 
for buying 12 million macmillan shares for a company employee 
stock option plan in 1987 
in a civil complaint filed wednesday at federal court in 
washington the sec sought an injunction to prohibit the trio from 
violating federal securities rules 
but simultaneously with the charges the three without 
admitting or denying wrongdoing settled and consented to an 
injunction barring them from violating securities disclosure rules 
a spokesman for macmillan in new york did not have an immediate 
comment on the settlement wednesday evening 
we believe it to be the first action the commission has 
brought in a filing by an esop which are increasingly being used 
as a takeover defense said herbert f janick iii an sec 
attorney in the case 
the sec complaint alleged that beginning in may 1987 evans 
reilly and chell began to develop a plan to recapitalize macmillan 
in anticipation of a possible hostile takeover 
evans later headed a macmillan management group that lost a 
takeover battle for macmillan to british media lord robert maxwell 
in 1988 a delaware court blocked a restructuring macmillan 
proposed as a defense against an unwanted 19 billion bid from the 
robert bass group bass later dropped his bid after competing 
offers were launched by the investment firm kohlberg kravis roberts 
amp co and maxwell 
according to the sec complaint as part of the alleged 
recapitalization proposal evans reilly and chell caused 
macmillans employee stock ownership plan esop to buy 12 million 
macmillan shares which was more than 5 percent of the 
thenoutstanding stock 
by law persons or companies acquiring 5 percent or more of a 
company must disclose their stake and state their intentions in an 
sec document known as a 13d 
but the sec charged that the 13d filed by the trio did not 
disclose that a purpose of the acquisition was to further the 
recapitalization 
evans lawyer richard m phillips issued a written statement 
concerning the settlement which said since the macmillan esops 
purchase of macmillan shares was extremely profitable to macmillan 
employees it satisfied the stated purpose of the transaction to 
allow employees to acquire stock ownership interest in the 
company 
mr evans is pleased that the secs action alleging that a 
further statement of purpose was necessary could be settled 
without spending the time and resources that would be required to 
litigate the commissions factual allegations and legal theories 
the statement said

the securities and exchange commission said it 
is ready to prosecute market manipulation by the practice of short 
selling but the evidence isnt always there 
were committed to identify short selling abuse wherever it 
may occur said john sturc of the secs enforcement division 
told a house panel wednesday 
but he and another sec official also told a subcommittee of the 
house committee on governmental affairs short selling also 
provides the market with two vital benefits 
richard g ketchum head of the secs division of market 
regulation told the panel those benefits are market liquidity and 
price efficiency which help prevent volatility the steep price 
rises and drops that can panic investors and send the market 
plunging 
but sturc an associate director of the enforcement division 
noted that he and ketchum were not here to defend or attack short 
selling 
in shortselling an investor tries to take advantage of an 
anticipated drop in the price of a companys stock the investor 
borrows stock from a broker and sells it hoping to replace it with 
stock purchased at a lower price the investors profit would come 
from the difference between the price obtained for the borrowed 
stock and the lower price paid to replace it 
short selling is not illegal and stockholders are allowed to 
lend or borrow stock they are holding for customers if the stock 
has been purchased on margin the buyer did not put up the full 
purchase price 
but in testimony last week before the commerce consumer and 
monetary affairs subcommittee some witnesses complained some 
professional shortsellers often break the rules to get a stock to 
drop quickly and spread false rumors about a company its products 
or its management 
that testimony was about the overthecounter market which does 
not have the same rules governing short sales as do the stock 
exchanges the national association of securities dealers a 
private selfregulating group oversees the overthecounter market 
sturc however noted that the sec considers all complaints of 
short selling abuses but often investigations do not lead to 
sustainable evidence of violations of the antifraud provisions of 
the federal securities laws 
at the beginning of the hearing the subcommittee chairman rep 
doug barnard jr dga said he was not sure that the sec is on 
the same wavelength as the subcommittee 
but sturc explained that often when companies complain they are 
the victims of short sellers spreading false rumors there is no 
proof where the rumors originated or whether it has had an effect 
of the companys stock 
we have a strong enforcement interest said sturc adding 
i regret to say mr chairman we have not received allegations 
of misconduct to quite the degree of specificity as has been 
presented to the subcommittee by several of the witnesses we would 
be happy to receive them my job is to try find violators and catch 
them and thats what i like to do 
after the session barnard told reporters that the hearings were 
not a witchhunt as far as the sec or nasd were concerned i 
thought there was good explanations

west germany today awarded a 
license to build and operate a private mobile telephone system that 
analysts estimate could be worth more than 5 billion to a 
fournation consortium 
led by mannesmann ag the group also includes pacific telesis 
group of the united states cable and wireless plc of britain 
lyonnaise des eaux of france and deutsche genossenschaftsbank a 
major west german bank 
the post ministry chose the consortium from a large field of 
contending groups which included several of west germanys largest 
companies and international telecommunications concerns 
the private network called d2 will compete with the post 
ministrys own d1 system it will be the second digital cellular 
system in west germany the german government now operates an 
analog cellular network and plans to build its own digital system 
mannesmann kienzle gmbh the electronics subsidiary of the west 
german engineering concern will hold a majority stake in the 
consortium called mannesmann mobilfunk gmbh 
analysts have said that operating a mobile phone network in 
denselypopulated west germany will be an extremely profitable 
business in the 1990s the value of the license has been estimated 
at 2 billion to 10 billion marks or the equivalent of about 11 
billion to 56 billion 
mannesmann has said construction of the network will require 
initial investments of 22 billion 
rumors that the consortium won the bidding war spurred a rally 
in mannesmann stock in recent days since last thursday mannesmann 
stock has surged some 25 percent to close at 34000 marks a share 
or about 192 on wednesday 
the decision by post minister christian schwarzschilling was 
based on a recommendation of a special advisory panel that ranked 
the mannesmann consortium first among the bidders 
pacific telesis which holds a 26 percent interest in the 
consortium has not put a dollar value on its share of the license 
but analysts estimate it could increase the pershare value of the 
companys stock by 3 or 4 as the financial market reacts to the 
announcement company spokeswoman amy damianakes said 
we view the cellular business as an alexander graham bell 
opportunity sam ginn pactels president and chief executive 
officer said in a news release today 
this license expands our reach into the international cellular 
market and provides significant potential for increasing shareowner 
value during the 1990s ginn said 
pacific telesis one of the baby bells created after the 
breakup of american telephone amp telegraph co has a contract with 
the consortium to design engineer and manage the new systems 
construction pactels 26 percent interest covers about 16 million 
potential cellular subscribers compared with its nearly 30 million 
potential subscribers in the united states ginn said 
other partners in the consortium are mannesmann ag deutsche 
genossenschaftsbank cable and wireless plc lyonnaise des eaux and 
the national associations of electrical and automobile trades

nadia comaneci will need her nimblest footwork 
since her perfect score on the balance beam to salvage her 
marketing potential now that her relationship with a married 
father of four kids has been made public 
i think there are some problems no one is going to touch her 
right now said jay ogden senior vice president of international 
management group which handles endorsements for us gymnast bart 
conner 
shes an intriguing sports figure but advertisers and 
companies have to be very careful ogden said wednesday there 
have to be some answers shes got to avoid the negatives 
sports agents believe there may still be marketability for 
comaneci the first gymnast to score a perfect 10 in the olympics 
she slogged six hours through mud and ice nov 28 to flee her 
native romania and now has refugee status in the united states 
time will tell if its a oneday furor it wont make any 
difference said leigh steinberg a los angeles agent who 
represents about 100 athletes including 13 professional 
quarterbacks 
this is entirely an issue of her private life prior to that 
disclosure she would have been very hot and marketable 
steinberg said if romantic peccadilloes disqualified someone from 
being perceived as an attractive personality half the people who 
do endorsements would not be doing them 
comanecis flight around whats left of the iron curtain was 
arranged by romanian emigre constantin panait 34 a selfemployed 
south florida roofer who has a wife and four children 
the two met at a party in 1987 in bucharest romania and 
comaneci knew he was married 
so what it didnt matter said the 28yearold comaneci 
who left behind her three gold medals from the 1976 olympics her 
family and a life of privilege for a chance to settle down 
together with panait 
the relationship may matter to corporations who routinely 
insert escape clauses that can void endorsement contracts if 
athletes engage in compromising behavior 
if anyone has a bad image with public or does something 
distasteful it makes it difficult to endorse a product the name 
of the game is selling said barbara bennett of new yorks grey 
advertising whose clients include tommy lasorda orel hershiser 
and dick butkus 
we prefer people to be squeaky clean said vangie haye they 
do it too this 
system has forced me to play better defense

chrysler corp says it wants to return to its 
roots and some industry analysts are praising the move 
the nations thirdlargest automaker announced wednesday that it 
has put its chrysler technologies corp subsidiary on the block 
sharply scaling back the companys diversification drive of earlier 
this decade 
chrysler said it has hired first boston corp to advise it on 
the sale of the aerospace and military technologies division it 
did not disclose what price it might seek 
chrysler technologies is comprised of gulfstream aerospace 
corp a corporate jet maker that was acquired for 637 million in 
1985 electrospace systems inc a maker of defense and electronics 
products and systems bought for 367 million in 1987 and airborne 
systems inc formed in january 1989 by combining military 
aviationrelated functions of gulfstream and electrospace 
the vast majority of chrysler technologies 1988 revenue of 13 
billion stems from gulfstream said john stellman a spokesman for 
chrysler technologies total chrysler corp revenues in 1988 were 
3547 billion 
chrysler also said wednesday that gulfstream founder and 
chairman allen paulson resigned from the chrysler board of 
directors and took a leave of absence from gulfstream to pursue a 
potential purchase of all or some of chrysler technologies 
paulson in a meeting wednesday with gulfstream employees in 
savannah ga said he mainly was interested in acquiring 
gulfstream but would make a bid for all of chrysler technologies if 
necessary 
paulson told the workers that if he made a successful bid for 
chrysler technologies he subsequently would attempt to sell 
electrospace systems and airborne systems 
he said he believes he will need about a week to prepare his 
offer but is working with banks about possible financing 
since oct 1 chrysler has been involved in an aggressive 
costcutting program to slash at least 1 billion from its budget 
by the end of next year including the elimination of about 2300 
or 8 percent of its salaried work force 
in september chrysler sold about half of its stake in the 
japanese automaker mitsubishi motors corp gaining about 310 
million after taxes 
sales of chrysler cars and light trucks for the year through 
nov 30 were 64 percent behind last years pace reflecting an 
industrywide slowdown 
chrysler said the chrysler technologies sale had been under 
consideration for some time 
weve had some informal inquiries said spokesman steve 
harris but weve never had any firm offers 
chrysler chairman lee iacocca said the vehicle market is going 
to be fiercely competitive in the future 
we intend to go headtohead with the toyotas and hondas of 
the world as well as anybody else in the market he said and 
this is the right time to take this step 
the only way to succeed in this kind of environment is to 
concentrate all our energies and resources on the task of 
satisfying our customers and insuring that our dealers have the 
best line of cars and trucks we can possibly produce iacocca 
said 
chrysler shares rose 12 cents to close at 1912 a share 
wednesday on the new york stock exchange 
although chrysler technologies accounted for a relatively small 
chunk of the parent companys overall earnings analysts said the 
businesses had been acquired as a way of helping diversify from the 
cyclical auto industry 
harris said chrysler technologies had about 149 million in 
pretax profits last year and the company had projected earnings of 
about 121 million this year chrysler corp had aftertax profits 
of 105 billion in 1988 
the company said the hopedfor sale was unrelated to cash needs 
but analyst kathleen heaney of nikko securities co international 
inc of new york questioned that assertion 
i dont see how they can say this isnt for cash she said 
it just seems like a big contradiction they made the 
acquisitions so they can be less dependent on the auto industry 
when chrysler announced the gulfstream acquisition in 1985 
iacocca called it an important step in our longrange plan to 
diversify into hightech industries like aerospace and 
electronics 
analyst mary anne sudol of fitch investors service inc of new 
york said the decision to sell chrysler technologies was a sound 
one since they bought it the world has changed she said 
in the current thawing in the cold war and the anticipated 
cuts in defense budgets an operation like that which is small 
relative to chryslers size makes less and less sense she added 
chrysler technologies has about 8300 employees harris said 
gulfstream has about 5000 workers electrospace has about 2000 
and chrysler technologies airborne systems has about 1300

phelps dodge corp says it will take pretax 
charges of about 375 million in the fourth quarter to write down 
the value of certain assets that have been idle for several years 
after deferred tax benefits these charges will reduce net 
income in the quarter by about 250 million or 7 per common 
share the copper company said wednesday adding it still expected 
to report a profit for the period 
the decision to take these charges at this time is unrelated 
to our outlook for copper and other market factors we remain 
bullish on the future douglas c yearly chairman and chief 
executive officer said in a statement 
yearly noted that the phoenixbased company has achieved 
record results for each of 1987 1988 and the first three quarters 
of 1989 and there is a continuing strong market for copper and 
most of our other products 
included in the charges are about 145 million for reserve 
provisions for the morenci smelter about 50 million for the new 
cornelia mine concentrator and smelter in ajo and certain other 
facilities that have been rendered obsolete by environmental 
requirements or other economic considerations 
the charges also reflect the reduction of about 115 million in 
assets stemming from the companys decision to indefinately defer 
any further preoperating mine development work on the dos pobres 
underground copper deposit near safford 
these assets are assets that have been idle since 1984 said 
thomas m foster a company vice president consequently this is 
a noncash charge to earnings that we feel we are not going to 
reactivate in the forseeable future 
richard moolick who retired as president of phelps dodge in 
1984 questioned the move 
the ajo mine at the prices weve been experiencing is a 
viable property moolick said he closed the mine in 1984 when 
faced with plunging copper prices 
however lew alton a managing general partner of the investment 
banking firm lh alton of san francisco praised the action 
you figure they have new people at the helm earnings are 
phenomenal and you get the opportunity to clean up the balance 
sheet why not do it when you have the chance he said 
phelps dodges net income for the quarter ended sept 30 was 
1154 million or 326 a share compared with net income of 933 
million or 253 a share for the same quarter last year 
in addition to its copper operations phelps dodge produces 
carbon black fabricates steel wheels and rims for trucks and 
manufactures magnet wire

lj hooker corp which tried unsuccessfully to 
sell its b altman amp co department store chain on thursday said 
it wants to find buyers for two other retailers bonwit teller and 
sakowitz 
the proposed sale of bonwit teller reverses hookers previous 
plan to retain the centuryold 16store upscale chain 
hooker which is operating under bankruptcy law protection from 
creditors said it has determined it would be best to seek buyers 
for new yorkbased bonwit teller and sakowitz a specialty retailer 
based in houston 
sanford c sigoloff chief executive of hooker said that while 
the bonwit teller and sakowitz operations have been doing better 
hooker management felt the best way to maximize returns was through 
a sale 
he said bonwit teller would be a more attractive property to 
potential buyers than altman was 
b altman required an investment of approximately 100 million 
to bring it to the point where it could compete sigoloff said in 
a news release bonwit teller and sakowitz each has markedly 
better physical facilities a more focused business and an 
uptodate image with its customers 
the sale of bonwit teller a whollyowned hooker subsidiary and 
sakowitz in which hooker bought a controlling interest two years 
ago should be completed within a relatively short period of 
time sigoloff said 
the bonwit chain has its flagship store in manhattans trump 
plaza and operates 15 branches scattered throughout the east 
midwest south and west sakowitzs main store is in the post oak 
galleria in houston and its six other stores are mostly in texas 
the plan to sell bonwit teller and sakowitz must be approved by 
the us bankruptcy court hooker said it is seeking the courts 
permission to retain financo inc a new yorkbased investment 
banking firm that specializes in retail transactions to handle the 
sales 
gilbert w harrison financos chairman said information about 
bonwit and sakowitz would be available for prospective bidders 
within two weeks 
we have received numerous inquiries concerning the possible 
sale of both bonwit teller and sakowitz he said 
robert sakowitz the chains president has indicated he would 
lead a group of investors in making a bid for the company hooker 
said in its news release 
a hooker spokeswoman amy goldberg said the company hasnt 
disclosed how much it wants for the two chains 
lj hooker filed for chapter 11 protection under the federal 
bankruptcy code in august after its financially distressed 
australian parent company hooker corp was turned over to a 
provisional liquidator 
last month lj hooker announced it had not received a suitable 
offer for altman and would close down six of the chains seven 
stores a goingoutofbusiness sale started the day after

a fournation consortium thursday won 
the rights to build and run a private mobile telephone network in 
west germany a license that some analysts say could amount to a 6 
billion gold mine in the 1990s 
the group led by mannesmann ag also includes pacific telesis of 
the united states cable and wireless plc of britain lyonnaise des 
eaux of france and deutsche genossenschaftsbank a major west 
german bank 
west germanys current mobile phone network operated by the 
government is suffering from severe capacity restraints 
a new network in the densely populated economically strong 
country is considered certain to be a highly profitable enterprise 
in the next decade but many analysts warn that implementation 
could face unforeseen delays or obstacles dueto changing regulation 
and increasing competition 
we view the cellular business as an alexander graham bell 
opportunity sam ginn chairman and chief executive officer of 
pacific telesis said in a news release issued from the companys 
san francisco headquarters 
this license expands our reach into the international cellular 
market and provides significant potential for increasing 
shareholder value in the 1990s ginn said 
the post ministry chose the consortium from a large field of 
contenders that included several of west germanys largest 
companies and international telecommunications concerns 
the private network called d2 will compete with the post 
ministrys own d1 system 
plans call for mannesmann and the postal service to start 
building separate networks in west germany in 1991 and complete 
them by 1994 post minister christian schwarzschilling told 
reporters the two systems will be integrated into a larger 
european network so the same cellular mobile phones can be used all 
over europe 
that consideration is significant because of plans by the 
12nation european community known as the common market to drop 
internal trade barriers by 1992 and create a unified market 
schwarzschilling said the new project will require investments 
of 11 billion to 23 billion 
the private network should break even by 1995 he said analysts 
say d2 could have 500000 or more users by that time 
mannesmann kienzle gmbh the electronics subsidiary of the west 
german engineering concern will hold a 51 percent stake in the 
consortium called mannesmann mobilfunk gmbh and based in 
duesseldorf west germany 
the final license agreement with mannesmann will be signed in 
january schwarzschilling said 
pacific telesis will hold 26 percent of the consortium dgbank 
10 percent cable and wireless 5 percent and lyonnaise des eaux 
25 percent the remaining 55 percent will be held by various 
smaller shareholders 
other bidders for the license included german heavyweights like 
bayerische motoren werke ag the maker of bmw cars axel springer 
verlag ag a major west german publisher and several big 
industrial firms 
under a formula used by us analysts to value mobile phone 
licenses the order could be worth 6 billion but others said that 
amount is too high because it does not consider necessary outlays 
and risks 
george verghese electronics analyst at deutsche bank ag in 
london cautioned that a europewide network could be delayed by 
disagreements within the european community 
he also said growing competition in coming years is likely to 
put pressure on profit margins 
on paper it all looks wonderful but the implementation could 
be delayed verghese said 
pacific telesis shares were up by 75 cents at 4850 a share in 
late new york stock exchange trading 
but mannesmann shares dropped by nearly 28 percent in domestic 
trading after the announcement on what traders called 
profittaking following a recent runup in the stock due to 
speculation about the phone license 
everybody got carried away by the idea that mannesmann got a 
license for printing money but for the next three years we will 
see only costs said beate von der seipen a london stock analyst

pinnacle west capital corp agreed to inject 450 
million into its troubled thrift subsidiary merabank just hours 
before tough new federal capital standards for thrifts took affect 
thursday 
the agreement announced late wednesday settled months of 
negotiations between pinnacle west and the office of thrift 
supervision over the federal agencys demand that pinnacle west 
inject 510 million into merabank 
pinnacle west has received a 187 billion takeover offer from 
pacificorp the utility company based in portland ore pacificorp 
executives were upbeat that the settlement would clear the way for 
a deal 
this agreement should free pinnacle west to devote full 
attention to addressing the offer from pacificorp we are eager to 
move ahead pacificorp executive vice president verl topham said 
in a statement 
under terms of its agreement with regulators pinnacle west will 
give merabank 300 million by march 31 1990 and a 150 million 
unsecured note 
the ots said the fair and reasonable settlement would avoid 
costly litigation pinnacle west had threated to seek bankruptcy 
protection if it could not reach an agreement with bank regulators 
pinnacle west said its board will consider the pacificorp offer 
on an unspecified date 
the bid which is conditioned upon pinnacle west disposing of 
merabank is an expansion of an earlier pacificorp offer to buy 
arizona public service co a pinnacle west subsidiary and 
arizonas largest utility 
pinnacle west chairman keith turley said the merabank settlement 
would not affect the pacificorp offer even though aps common stock 
would be used as collateral to secure financing for the cash 
infusion into merabank 
renz jennings chairman of the threemember arizona corporation 
commission which regulates utilities voiced concern over the link 
with aps 
he said the commission is deeply concerned about the 
possibility that pinnacle west creditors will look to aps for 
repayment 
but turley countered that its illogical for anybody to think 
that aps would assume the debt obligations of pinnacle west its 
impossible and illegal for aps to raise its rates to pay our 
interest on debt 
merabank chairman gene rice called the infusion an important 
beginning of the recapitalization of merabank and said the 
thrift which has been hard hit by arizonas real estate slump 
would be able to get back on its feet eventually but he cautioned 
that the market is going down and we will continue to have 
losses in the short term 
merabank lost 209 million in 1988 and 105 million in the first 
six months of this year with a projected loss of about the same 
amount in the last six months 
jennings criticized the settlement for saddling pinnacle west 
with additional debt at a time when the company can ill afford 
it and leaves ownership of merabank in the hands of pinnacle west 
with no assurance that losses will not continue to mount 
in addition to aps and merabank pinnacle west also owns three 
small subsidiaries involved in mining real estate development and 
investments

one of the customers on denny 
grinwalds lake michigan charter boat this summer put the hard 
times facing the lakes sport fishing businesses into painfully 
clear perspective 
he said captain i understand theres bad news and good news 
on the lake the bad news is i cant eat the fish i catch the 
good news is im not going to be able to catch one 
grinwald president of the michigan charter boat association 
isnt laughing 
what was by us fish and wildlife service estimates the 
cornerstone of a 16 billion great lakes fishery for michigan in 
1985 has weakened dramatically 
a bacterial disease seems to be decimating the lakes 
breadandbutter sport fish chinook salmon and this summer the 
national wildlife federation issued a controversial warning that 
chemical contamination was making the fish a risky meal 
low catches and fish consumption warnings drove 140 michigan 
charter boats off the lake this year leaving 876 operators where 
two years ago there were more than 1000 grinwald said wednesday 
more are expected to leave by spring 
i know at least six boats from ludington that will go to new 
york next year ludington charter captain jim lacko said 
thats bad when you lose charter boats you start losing motel 
rooms 
lacko estimates he lost half of his business in the past two 
years the fishing is just not there he said 
wisconsins creel surveys show a 50 percent drop in the number 
of chinook salmon caught said mike hansen a wisconsin department 
of natural resources fish specialist in madison 
michigan surveys map a drop in the amount of time sport 
fishermen spent on the lake down from 35 million hours spent at 
nine ports in the mid1980s to an estimated 18 million hours this 
year said gerald rakoczy michigan department of natural resources 
biologist in charlevoix 
the chinook catch alone in the region from ludington to 
frankfort along the middle western coast of lake michigan along 
michigans lower peninsula dropped from 242000 fish in may and 
august of 1986 to 34000 chinook the same period this year 
grinwald said 
chinook salmon introduced into lake michigan more than 25 years 
ago to control an alien alewife population are the dominant sport 
fish in the lake and make up more than half the catch according to 
wisconsin record keepers 
the salmon sport fishing industry supports not only charter 
operations but has helped revitalize many coastal towns 
ive always felt the economic clout of the great lakes sport 
fishery is greatly undervalued said james kitchell a university 
of wisconsinmadison researcher you see potted geraniums on the 
pilings in grand haven mich where before that was nothing you 
get boatels in marinas it is the single most remarkable thing 
thats happened in fishery management 
dramatic declines in the salmon population can only be bad for 
the coastal economy kitchell said 
wright said he is unsure the lake again will host the fishery 
created by overstocking of chinook salmon and an abundance of 
alewife that kept charter boat operators booked solid in the 
early 1980s 
some of the marginal operations obviously are going to drop 
out he said the hard core 270 to 400 charter operations 
are still going to be there theyll fish for what is available 
lake michigan is still a good place to fish grinwald said 
its just not the fantastic incredible fishery it was

grain and soybean futures prices closed lower in 
sluggish trading thursday on the chicago board of trade 
the slide in wheat prices was due to the release wednesday of 
the national weather services six to 10day forecast which calls 
for precipitation in the winter wheat crop areas said analyst 
susan leighty of prudentialbache securities inc in new york 
wheat futures received little support from news the us 
department of agriculture has approved an offer by the soviet union 
for 410000 metric tons of wheat under the departments export 
enhancement program 
under the program private exporters can sell us commodities 
at reduced prices to meet foreign competition in some markets and 
collect free government surpluses of grain or other commodities as 
bonuses or subsidies 
corn futures traded in a narrow range finishing lower as 
professionals and commission houses liquidated their long positions 
soybean prices continue to be weighed down by a lack of export 
business and continuing good planting conditions in south america 
ms leighty said that overall futures prices may have been held 
down by the lack of announcements from the grain talks between the 
united states and the soviet union the first round of negotiations 
in moscow to reach a new longterm grain pact ended thursday the 
two sides plan to meet again in february 
at the close wheat prices were cent to 2 cents lower with 
the contract for delivery in december at 408 a bushel corn was 
unchanged to 2 cents lower with december at 236 a bushel oats 
were a cent to a cent lower with december at 144 a bushel 
soybeans were 2 cents to 7 cents lower with january at 575 a 
bushel

grand metropolitan plc reported thursday that its 
net profit jumped 23 percent during its fiscal year boosted by 
higher revenue from its food beverage and retailing operations 
the british conglomerate said its profit for the year ended 
sept 30 rose to 508 million pounds or around 823 million from 
412 million pounds or 667 million the year before 
pershare earnings increased 186 percent to 556 pence or 87 
cents from 469 pence or 74 cents 
grand met bought pillsbury co of the united states for 575 
billion earlier this year 
revenue for the year soared 542 percent to 93 billion pounds 
or 146 billion from 603 billion pounds or 95 billion 
the gains included proceeds from the sale of the companys 
intercontinental hotels and london clubs in december 1988 for more 
than 500 million pounds or 810 million 
the greatest impact on the companys results came from 
pillsbury which contributed 25 billion pounds or 39 billion 
to total revenue 
grand met said intense activity to integrate pillsbury has 
included the sale of nonstrategic businesses such as its bumble 
bee and van de kamp foods operations 
all parts of the business are performing strongly and 
management morale is high the company said 
burger king the fastfood chain which was owned by pillsbury 
contributed 76 million pounds or 119 million to grand mets 
operating profit the parent company said it will take time for the 
benefits of a recent restructuring and quality improvement program 
to bear fruit but the fundamentals of this business are very 
sound 
grand met said sales from its food businesses including those 
that were part of pillsbury were strong in all divisions and are 
expected to climb 5 percent in the current quarter 
but the slowdown in the british economy has been especially 
evident in the companys liquor sales over the last 12 to 15 
months said grand met chairman allen sheppard 
the company likely will make further acquisitions and sales in 
the coming year but it is now prepared to consolidate its current 
businesses in food beverages and retailing sheppard said 
grand met didnt report quarterly or halfyear results it is 
not required to do so under british law

navistar international corp on thursday reported 
a 13 million fourthquarter loss and said reduced industrywide 
demand for trucks and higher costs for purchased components 
contributed to the decline 
the truck and diesel engine maker said it lost 8 cents a share 
on sales of 1 billion compared with a profit for the yearearlier 
period of 82 million or 29 cents a share on sales of 12 billion 
for fiscal 1989 which ended oct 31 navistar earned 87 
million or 23 cents a share on sales of 42 billion down from 
1988 annual profits of 244 million or 84 cents a share on sales of 
43 billion the company said in a statement 
navistar chairman james c cotting blamed the fourthquarter 
performance on reduced demand for medium and heavy trucks higher 
costs for components and lower sales of service parts and diesel 
engines to other vehicle makers 
annual earnings were lowered by the excess costs of adding 
27 new truck models and of phasing in a new paint system at 
navistars springfield ohio plant the company said navistar 
spokesman bill greenhouse said the company underestimated the cost 
of introducing the new models 
the company also said it expects to post a 1990 firstquarter 
loss because of lower truck and engine sales increased material 
and component costs and continued intense price discounting by 
truck manufacturers

gulfstream aerospace corp chairman allen 
e paulson says he will be ready in about a week to present a bid 
to buy back the company he founded 
chrysler corp announced wednesday it plans to sell its chrysler 
technologies corp subsidiary which includes savannahbased 
gulfstream acquired by the nations no 3 automaker in 1985 
paulson immediately resigned from the chrysler board of 
directors and took a leave of absence from gulfstream to pursue a 
potential purchase of all or some of chrysler technologies 
he told a gathering of gulfstream workers in savannah wednesday 
that he is mainly interested in acquiring gulfstream though he 
would try to buy all of chrysler technologies if thats what is 
necessary to get the corporate aircraft maker he founded 
paulson told the workers that if he made a successful bid for 
chrysler technologies he would subsequently attempt to sell the 
other parts of that company electrospace systems and airborne 
systems 
paulson said he believes he will need about a week to prepare 
his offer and will then return to work at gulfstream 
i have a contract with chrysler to fulfill a year at 
gulfstream he said 
paulson ruled out the possibility of a managementled buyout of 
gulfstream financed through bonds i am working with banks i am 
interested in bank financing and putting my own assets to work 
he said 
chrysler paid 637 million for gulfstream in 1985 the vast 
majority of chrysler technologies 1988 revenue of 13 billion 
stems from gulfstream said john stellman a spokesman for chrysler 
technologies total chrysler corp revenues in 1988 were 355 
billion 
chrysler spokesman steve harris said the company would consider 
selling all of chrysler technologies or just part depending on the 
offers it receives 
chrysler would look at the best return for chrysler 
shareholders he said 
harris said chrysler already has received several inquiries for 
part or all of chrysler technologies but at this time we do not 
have any firm offers on the table 
chrysler said it has hired first boston corp to advise it on 
the sale of the aerospace and military technologies division it 
did not disclose what price it might seek 
john zimmerman president of aviation data service in wichita 
kan an aviation information and consulting service said 
paulsons chances of acquiring gulfstream are excellent 
mr paulson is a very brilliant man with insight to the 
aviation industry it is not inconceivable that somebody would work 
with mr paulson in financing a deal he said 
chrysler technologies electrospace systems and airborne systems 
divisions specialize in the production of military reconnaissance 
and surveillance equipment

diet pepsis new the right one advertising 
jingle has become a battle hymn for the cola wars with the ad 
agency for rival diet coke disputing who owns the idea for the tune 
the song was picked up for diet pepsi after a similar version 
apparently was offered to rival diet coke as well as budweiser beer 
cokes ad agency lintasnew york complains that it should have 
been given the chance to buy the song before it was offered to 
anyone else while pepsi is calling the protest a simple publicity 
stunt by its rival cola maker 
stone roberts executive vice president of lintasnew york said 
the song used in the diet pepsi television spot was written last 
year for diet coke although it never was used publicly 
roberts said he fired off a complaint letter to sunday 
productions the new york music house that developed the song 
after hearing the similar song in a diet pepsi ad during the 
thanksgiving weekend 
id like to believe they pepsi didnt know it was ours and 
didnt buy it in a direct attempt to copy the industry leader 
roberts said thursday 
but hilary lipsitz president of sunday productions said it was 
ludicrous for coke or its ad agency to say they own the song 
lipsitz said he offered the song to other companies including 
budweiser brewer anheuserbusch cos after coke rejected it for a 
possible ad campaign dubbed the real one 
there was no interest from cocacola it was our song 
lipsitz said thursday its pretty much as if they came to irving 
berlin and said write me a song and didnt use it whose song 
would it be 
lipsitz said the tune was among several he presented to pepsi 
roberts said diet coke wanted a song as a backup to its current 
ad campaign if and when the day came where we needed a 
substitute 
sunday productions brought back some pieces of music developed 
from our concept roberts said adding that sunday was paid a 
10000 demo fee a commercial was prepared and then put on 
the shelf for possible use later he said 
roberts said lintas should have been given the opportunity to 
buy the song outright before it was offered to anyone else the 
agency is considering legal action he said 
officials at the ad agency bbdo worldwide who work on the diet 
pepsi account did not immediately return telephone calls thursday 
becky madeira a spokeswoman at pepsi colas purchase ny 
headquarters called the complaints a publicity stunt by 
atlantabased rival coke 
its hard to find any other reason for all of this she 
said i understand the press had copies of the letters of 
complaint before the principals 
ms madeira said diet pepsi has been using the right one 
slogan since august but hadnt heard any complaints until the 
television commercial appeared last month she also said pepsis 
application for a trademark for the right one was made in july 
and drew no objection from coke 
she said it is not unusual for companies to choose from several 
songs when considering an ad campaign 
ms madeira also said pepsi looks for music that reflects the 
character of its products so it would be pointless to seek a song 
belonging to a competitor 
its hard to imagine that would make sense for either 
company she said why would you advertise the personality of a 
competitors product

unemployment rate of 54 percent 
unfavorable employment data indicate the economy is slowing and

the inability of the soviet unions national 
airline to provide the service and comfort its citizens want has 
created the market for a new carrier one that might fly 
americanmade jets according to two members of the soviet 
parliament 
valeri voskoboinikov vice chairman of the soviet transport 
communication and information commission and commission member 
vladimir yerohin were part of a delegation representing 
aviakompania sverkhdalnikh avialiniy or asda 
the new company was formed last summer to explore creation of a 
new longrange soviet airline to be run independent of the 
government and compete with governmentowned aeroflot 
the delegation has been gathering information about possible 
acquisitions of boeing jetliners 
the idea for asda said voskoboinikov came from aeroflot pilots 
and aircraft engineers tired of the carriers bureaucracy 
in this situation aeroflot is the only airline in the soviet 
union he said it cannot provide good service for the soviet 
citizens and cannot provide satisfactory management 
this year alone there were 20 million potential passengers who 
couldnt be served by aeroflot yerohin said noting that was the 
official figure and the real number is probably higher 
in addition to being the noncommunist worlds largest maker of 
jetliners boeing in the past 40 years has produced some of this 
countrys deadliest weapons for use against the soviets including 
the b52 bomber and minuteman and airlaunched cruise missiles 
boeing already sells jets to china poland and other communist 
nations 
aeroflot the worlds largest airline already has ordered 
airbus industrie a310 jets and has talked with boeing and 
mcdonnell douglas corp about possible commercial jet purchases 
voskoboinikov 34 from northwest siberia is a helicopter pilot 
and aeronautical engineer yerohin also 34 and an aircraft 
engineer is from gorky neither is a member of the communist party 
neither they nor boeing would say much about their talks 
including how many planes asda might want or what type nor would 
they say much about the airlines financial arrangements 
much of that hasnt been decided voskoboinikov said including 
whether the new carrier might have some western investment or be a 
joint venture with a foreign airline the goal is to have an 
airline totally independent financially of the soviet 
government 
he and yerohin stressed the delegation came to the united states 
only to gather information to study later they said it was invited 
by boeing and did not plan to visit mcdonnell douglas on this trip 
asda officials previously have said they were interested in 25 
boeing 747400s but neither of the two soviet deputies would say 
how many of those longrange jumbo jets or other planes asda might 
want to buy or lease 
a 747400 costs 125 million or more and boeing is booked solid 
with orders through the mid1990s asda hopes to start up by late 
1991 
right now negotiations are in process and we cannot really 
tell you what the plans and operations are he said but i can 
tell you the atmosphere of the negotiations is good 
the soviet aerospace industry produces a wide variety of 
passenger and cargo jets and both voskoboinikov and yerohin said 
they are about the same as boeing planes in reliability but they 
cant match the levels of comfort in western aircraft and boeing 
planes are far more economical to run vokoboinikov said 
he also says soviet planebuilders wont like the competition 
they will not be happy about it but at the same time they 
will realize they should improve their service vokoboinikov 
said ultimately the usage of new foreign airplanes will cause 
improvement of the domestic industry which will be good for it 
routes and destinations havent been decided but voskobionikov 
said they want to fly to practically all parts of the world 
with both passenger and cargo service 
aeroflot flies an estimated 8100 aircraft to more than 3700 
destinations asda wont be able to replace that voskobionikov 
said but there is a market 
there probably will be clientele for both airlines and 
our passengers are not used to good service like they are here 
he said

yorks commodity exchange in reaction to a decline in prices on the 
new york stock exchange 
in other markets grains and soybeans were lower cotton 
plunged livestock and pork futures were mixed and energy prices 
were mostly lower 
gold settled 410 to 510 higher with the contract for 
delivery in december at 41000 a troy ounce silver was 65 cents 
to 72 cents higher with december at 5623 a troy ounce 
the sharp fall in the stock market caused a flight to quality 
buying in the precious metals market said analyst jim steel 
of refco inc in new york 
steel noted that many things have caused movement in precious 
metals prices including dollar strength or weakness interest 
rates and inflation 
but what has given gold its bold moves upward have been the 
declines in the stock market he said 
silver prices followed gold in thursdays upward surge helped 
along by the perception that the metal has been sharply oversold in 
recent sessions steel said 
cotton futures were sharply lower on the new york cotton 
exchange as traders had difficulty unloading offerings because of a 
lack of buyers 
at one time the march contract was down the limit before 
recovering some losses said analyst ed whitten of balfour maclaine 
corp in new york

prices moved below several support levels 
cotton was 23 cent to 155 cents lower with december at 6397 
cents a pound 
grain and soybean futures prices closed lower in sluggish 
trading on the chicago board of trade 
the slide in wheat prices was due to the release wednesday of 
the national weather services six to 10day forecast which calls 
for precipitation in the winter wheat crop areas said analyst 
susan leighty of prudentialbache securities inc in new york 
wheat futures received little support from news the us 
department of agriculture has approved an offer by the soviet union 
for 410000 metric tons of wheat under the departments export 
enhancement program 
under the program private exporters can sell us commodities 
at reduced prices to meet foreign competition in some markets and 
collect free government surpluses of grain or other commodities as 
bonuses or subsidies 
corn futures traded in a narrow range finishing lower as 
professionals and commission houses liquidated their long positions 
soybean prices continue to be weighed down by a lack of export 
business and continuing good planting conditions in south america 
wheat was cent to 2 cents lower with december at 408 a 
bushel corn was 2 cents lower to a cent higher with december at 
236 a bushel oats were a cent lower to a cent higher with 
december at 144 a bushel soybeans were 3 cents to 7 cents 
lower with january at 575 a bushel

higher with january at 2051 a barrel heating oil was 30 cent 
lower to 101 cents higher with january at 6547 cents a gallon 
unleaded gasoline was 36 cent lower to 07 cent higher with 
january at 5281 cent a gallon 
livestock futures were mostly lower and pork futures down 
sharply on the chicago mercantile exchange

house selling the selling was prompted by continued concern over 
the large amount of bellies going into storage and accelerated by 
the activation of sellstops 
live cattle were 30 cent lower to 20 cent higher with december 
at 7562 cents a pound feeder cattle were 20 cent lower to 03 
cent higher with january at 8295 cents a pound hogs were 10 cent

shearson lehman hutton inc stock fell sharply 
thursday amid reports of a huge recapitalization plan that would 
inject up to 1 billion into the ailing brokerage 
shearson has been under increasing pressure in recent weeks to 
take steps to improve its profitability and avoid a credit 
downgrading that would tarnish the firms reputation and increase 
its borrowing costs 
american express co which owns 61 percent of shearson 
reportedly is planning a public sale of 10 million to 22 million 
shares of shearson stock and a direct investment of about 300 
million to raise new capital 
in addition revlon inc chairman ronald o perelman reportedly 
is holding talks about buying a 99 percent stake in shearson for 
about 250 million 
lawrence a armour an american express senior vice president 
confirmed his company is reviewing a number of options in 
regard to shearson but he said it would be inappropriate to 
discuss any details 
armour said the review process has been under way for several 
weeks 
shearson spokesman michael oneill declined comment on the 
recapitalization reports 
shearson closed down 175 or about 106 percent at 1475 a 
share in new york stock exchange trading the stock rose 137 
wednesday on reports that perelman might buy up to a 20 percent 
interest in the company 
analysts pegged thursdays drop to the lower stake perelman 
would have in the latest purported proposal reducing the 
possibility of a takeover and to the potential dilution of shares 
under any new stock issue 
theres no way the common shareholder comes out well in this 
said analyst lawrence eckenfelder of prudentialbache securities 
inc in san francisco 
shearson stock has slumped for several months because of poor 
earnings reports the company began searching for new capital after 
moodys investors service in october said it was considering 
downgrading its credit on 48 billion in longterm shearson debt 
shearson recently began laying off 800 workers reducing the 
size of the nations secondlargest brokerage to 35700 reshuffled 
its senior management and slashed stockbroker commissions for the 
first time in 15 years 
a downgrading by moodys would increase shearsons cost of 
borrowing by about 10 million to 15 million a year eckenfelder 
said securities firms borrow heavily to finance finance trading 
and other activities 
more important analysts said american express wants to avoid 
any loss of reputation theres a sense that its important for 
the owners to maintain shearson as a top credit eckenfelder said 
under the reported recapitalization proposal american express 
would reduce its shearson holding to under 50 percent through the 
new offering and the perelman deal that would allow the credit 
card travel and financial service company to remove shearson from 
its financial statements 
eckenfelder said selling securities in a brokerage might prove 
difficult because of slumping conditions throughout the industry 
the proposed recapitalization would dilute the holdings of 
shearsons secondlargest stockholder nippon life insurance of 
japan to about 10 percent from 13 percent 
the proposal was reported in the new york times and the wall 
street journal which cited unidentified sources 
earlier reports said perelman would have been able to obtain 
about 20 percent of shearsons stock if he exercised all of his 
stock options under the deal as originally proposed but the times 
said the proposed transaction was altered to make it less complex 
while any such deal would provide needed capital for shearson 
some analysts have cautioned that further dividing the ownership of 
shearson among three or more large outsiders could prove to be a 
headache for executives under pressure to turn around the firms 
slumping profits 
moodys said it was mulling a possible credit rating downgrade 
for shearsons bonds and commercial paper due to the firms low 
level of capital low profits and exposure in commercial real 
estate loans and investments as well as the general slump in 
brokerage activity

of stock in chevron corp the nations fourth largest oil company 
pennzoils purchase amounts to about 88 percent of chevron and 
pennzoil said it was considering spending another 500 million to 
buy more chevron stock that would boost its stake to more than 10 
percent and use up all the net proceeds of its payment from texaco 
the disclosure came in a letter to shareholders and filings with 
the federal security and exchange commission 
this position has been acquired as a longterm investment 
houstonbased pennzoil told shareholders pennzoil has no 
interest in attempting to take over chevron 
the company said it analyzed the possibility of buying up to 18 
percent of chevrons stock but has no current plans or 
proposals to do so 
the announcement helped deflate takeover speculation that had 
surrounded chevron chevron stock dropped 525 to close at 6675 
in composite trading on the new york stock exchange 
pennzoil rose 62 cents to close at 8325 as some investors 
speculated that chevron might try to turn the tables and buy 
pennzoils stake or even buy all of pennzoil 
the perception by some investors is that chevrons response 
will be to turn around and buy pennzoil to make the problem go 
away no one believes for a minute that pennzoil intends to buy 
chevron said analyst thomas escott at rauscher pierce refsnes 
inc a dallas investment firm 
there isnt any way pennzoils going to come in and take 
chevron over agreed another analyst george gaspar of robert w 
baird amp co in milwaukee 
however ron londe with ag edwards amp sons in st louis said 
the purchase nevertheless could be a good move pennzoils 
notorious for being a very astute investor 
san franciscobased chevron declined to comment on the 
announcement 
only wednesday chevron announced a 1 billion sale of 141 
million shares of common stock to an employee stock owner plan that 
could make any takeover more difficult the stock about 5 percent 
of the companys outstanding shares was added to 11 percent 
already held by an employee profitsharing plan 
chevron which paid 133 billion to buy gulf oil four years 
ago has seen its stock climb in recent weeks on rumors of a 
possible takeover bid with pennzoil mentioned as a likely suitor 
last year pennzoil received 3 billion in an outofcourt 
settlement of its lawsuit against texaco over getty oil co in 1984 
and observers have been watching closely to see what the company 
would do with its windfall 
pennzoil had sued texaco claiming texacos 1984 acquisition of 
getty oil co interfered with its plans to buy part of getty in 
1985 a houston jury awarded pennzoil 103 billion texaco appealed 
but eventually settled with pennzoil for the smaller amount 
over the past several months your management and board of 
directors have reviewed numerous business situations in an effort 
to find an investment opportunity similar to pennzoils former 
stake in getty oil co said the letter signed by pennzoil 
chairman j hugh liedtke and president randal b mcdonald 
after thorough study we have concluded that chevron is by far 
the most appealing company in the entire spectrum and particularly 
in its peer group 
noting chevrons profitability has not matched its market 
position pennzoil said chevron has demonstrated expertise in 
dealing with strictly financial affairs in the past it has not 
seemed to focus that expertise on its operational divisions if it 
now does so we believe the results could be pleasantly 
surprising 
pennzoil spokesman robert harper said the company had until the 
end of 1990 to reinvest the money from texaco to avoid tax 
liabilities 
pennzoil said it believed it could provide constructive 
support to chevron chairman kenneth t derrs plans to improve 
the companys performance 
chevron rich in oil and gas reserves and a highperforming 
chemicals unit had sales in 1988 of 289 billion down from 291 
billion in 1987 earnings last year totaled 18 billion or 517 
a share up about 40 percent from 13 billion or 365 a share 
in its latest quarter chevrons earnings edged down to 417 
million or 122 a share from 420 million or 123 a share a 
year earlier 
pennzoil whose main business is in motor oil and sulphur 
reported third quarter income of 354 million or 87 cents per 
share compared to 393 million 93 cents for the same period a 
year ago revenue rose to 644 million in the third quarter 
compared to 617 million in 1988

adhering to federal standards 
abbott stock closed at 6712 a share down 125 in new york

been becoming a little sloppy where it looked like there could be 
potential problems harshbarger said

fda inspection july 5 through nov 3 at the plant he said 80 
percent of the issues cited were nitpicking minor problems and

ongoing investigation this report is observations and from it the 
regulatory people have to determine what type of regulatory action 
has to be taken

meeting thursday morning to advise clients of the report

reports observations were technical in nature but she didnt 
elaborate

faced with momentous change by its east 
european neighbors the european community must accelerate its 
drive for closer economic ties a top official of the trading bloc 
said thursday 
we are facing the shock of necessity said jacques delors 
president of the european commission the communitys executive 
body 
we must maintain the community as a magnet as a 
stabilizing factor he told reporters on the eve of a summit of 
west european leaders in strasbourg france this is our historic 
duty 
delors appealed to the leaders to move forward with 
controversial plans to forge a tighter economic and monetary union 
of the dozen nations known as the common market 
he urged ec leaders who will meet friday and saturday to set a 
date for a special conference to revise the communitys founding 
treaty and create the monetary union 
at the summit the leaders also were expected to discuss plans 
to adopt a social charter guaranteeing minimum rights to workers in 
the europeanwide market to be established in 1992 also on the 
agenda was a french plan to set up a development bank to provide 
money to east european countries adopting political and economic 
reforms 
in addition the leaders may discuss a proposal announced last 
month that the ec form a closer relationship with the six european 
free trade association countries 
under the proposal by the ecs executive commission the six 
efta nations austria iceland finland norway sweden and 
switzerland would gain freedom of movement for people goods 
services and capital with the ec in effect creating a vast open 
european market 
nico wegter the ec foreign affairs spokesman said last month 
the 12 ec foreign ministers agreed that on dec 19 when they meet 
their efta colleagues they should take a clear political 
commitment so that we can begin negotiations next year 
cooperation between the two trade blocs also would be 
strengthened in the areas of research environment consumer 
protection working conditions social welfare education and 
foreign policy under the proposal 
french president francois mitterrand the summit host wants the 
strasbourg meeting to schedule the intergovernmental conference on 
monetary union for the second half of 1990 
a west german government official said thursday that chancellor 
helmut kohl who wants the conference begun after late 1990 german 
elections would agree to formally launching the conference in 
december 1990 providing work did not begin until 1991 
british prime minister margaret thatcher strongly has opposed 
radical plans for monetary union which would lead to a joint 
currency and a europeanwide system of central banks she also has 
opposed setting a timetable for the special conference 
but mitterrand was expected to push hard for a decision to hold 
the conference next fall 
it is on this that the success or failure of the strasbourg 
summit will be judged said a french official in paris demanding 
anonymity it is a risk but the situation in eastern europe 
forces us to take it 
delors and others argue that the upheavals in the east require 
the common market to move more quickly in uniting on economic and 
other issues us president george bush has urged the trading bloc 
to be a magnet that draws the forces of reform forward in eastern 
europe 
but mrs thatcher argues that the sweeping plans for monetary 
union would require governments to surrender some of their 
sovereignty 
she reiterated her opposition at mondays north atlantic treaty 
organization summit in brussels saying such a system is not a 
step toward democracy but a step away from it 
french officials were worried that west germany would hesitate 
in supporting full european integration the opening of borders 
between east and west germany has raised concern that bonns 
attention may shift to its eastern neighbors 
french foreign minister roland dumas said france expected west 
germany to show irrefutable proof of its support for european 
integration 
a west german source demanding anonymity said at the nato 
gathering that we must make clear in strasbourg that west germany 
is interested in the further economic and monetary integration of 
europe 
moves for a monetary union have added another dimension to the 
european communitys plans to fashion a single market by the end of 
1992 by then the nations want to remove the many trade barriers 
that prevent the free movement of people goods services and money 
the special conference would be needed to revise the treaty of 
rome which set up the common market in 1957 the treaty would have 
to be altered to put into effect some of the recommendations for 
closer monetary ties made in a report by a group of central 
bankers 
the report proposed setting up a new agency to make and 
implement monetary policy and to manage exchange rate policy it 
also recommended that a single currency eventually be created with 
each nation abandoning its present currency 
at a june summit in madrid the ec leaders agreed to proceed 
with the first stage of a threepart plan the first stage 
scheduled to begin july 1 would link all the ec currencies to the 
european monetary mechanism that keeps exchange rates for those 
currencies roughly stable within a certain range 
the currencies of britain greece and portugal are not now part 
of that system

federal regulators have approved a 450 million 
capital infusion from pinnacle west capital corp to its troubled 
merabank subsidiary the thrifts chairman said late wednesday 
this is an important beginning of the recapitalization of 
merabank it means about 45 million a year in interest revenue 
said chairman gene rice 
however the chairman of the arizona corporation commission said 
the transfer was an ominous sign for arizona public serivce co 
the states largest public utility and pinnacle wests only 
profitable subsidiary for the past two years 
pinnacle west a 13 billionayear phoenixbased holding 
company was founded to run arizona public service on friday 
pacificorp a portland ore utility holding company announced it 
wanted to buy pinnacle west in a deal valued at about 187 billion 
the bid which is conditioned upon pinnacle west disposing of 
merabank is an expansion of an earlier offer from pacificorp to 
buy arizona public service pinnacle west created concern in 1986 
when it bought merabank just as the problems that have plagued us 
savings and loans became most acute 
the acquisition was criticized because of the possibility that 
the sampl could siphon funds from the utility company a robust 
dividendproducer pinnacle west has repeatedly denied any shifting 
of funds among its subsidiaries 
the settlement announced tonight saddles pinnacle west 
with additional debt at a time when the company can ill afford it 
and leaves ownership of merabank in the hands of pinnacle west with 
no assurance that losses will not continue to mount said renz 
jennings chairman of the corporation commission in a statement 
he said the regulatory commission was worried about the 
possibility that pinnacle west creditors will look to arizona 
public service co for repayment 
this commission has moved in the past to prevent the parent 
company from draining the resources of aps at the expense of 
ratepayers and the commission will do so again without 
hesitation or reservation jennings added 
pinnacle west chairman keith turley said the company and the 
federal office of thrift supervision office in san francisco agreed 
that pinnacle west will pay merabank 300 million in cash and 
accrued interest by march 31 1990 pinnacle west also said it will 
give the thrift an unsecured note for 150 million 
turley did not address the concerns over arizona public service 
pinnacle wests only company that falls under the direct purview of 
state regulators 
we also believe the state of arizona is well served by this 
resolution he said 
pinnacle west has obtained a commitment from chase manhattan 
bank chemical bank citibank and morgan guaranty trust co all of 
new york to lend the 300 million needed to come up with the first 
infusion in less than four months turley said 
he said the assumption of additional debt would require pinnacle 
west to renegotiate certain existing debt obligations for 
merabank a subsidiary it has placed on the sales block 
merabank lost 209 million in 1988 and 105 million in the first 
six months of this year with a projected loss of about the same 
amount in the last six months 
after a very difficult time over the past 18 months we 
believe this agreement is in the best interest of pinnacle west 
shareholders and will help reestablish the companys position in 
the financial community turley said
