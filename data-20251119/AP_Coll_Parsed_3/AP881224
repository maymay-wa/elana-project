a jury ordered a psychiatrist to pay nearly 
19 million to a female patient with whom he had sex numerous times 
over a 12year period billing her for each visit 
the multnomah county circuit court jury deliberated for five 
hours thursday before reaching its verdict against dr james l 
petroske of portland 
the woman a 55yearold former elementary school teacher was 
awarded 832000 in general damages for pain and suffering 1 
million in punitive damages and 43800 in lost wages 
testimony and evidence presented during the twoweek trial 
indicated petroske began treating the woman in 1967 and started 
having sexual relations with her in 1975 
james huegli the womans attorney said petroske ended the 
sexual relations in early 1987 while he was being investigated by 
the state board of medical examiners about allegations that he was 
having sex with another patient 
petroske admitted he lied to the state board about the number of 
patients with whom he had sexual relations in early july the board 
suspended him from practice for 90 days fined him 5000 and placed 
him on probation for 10 years 
petroskes attorney carol a hewitt told jurors during closing 
arguments that her client is not going to be practicing medicine 
under any circumstances after this case is over 
hewitt admitted petroske had inflicted physical damage on the 
patient but she contended it was not permanent huegli however 
said other doctors thought the woman suffered permanent brain damage 
from what he called a long insidious poisoning regimen of 
drugs prescribed by petroske 
huegli said petroski billed the woman for all her visits 
including the ones in which they engaged in sex

two groups of feuding nuns at a 
monastery here will be separated by an iron gate as they celebrate 
the same christmas mass unreconciled after a 2month standoff 
five nuns who remain locked in the monasterys infirmary have 
said they will not rejoin eight other nuns until the vatican in rome 
answers their pleas to end the dispute over liberalizations of their 
order 
theyll watch the midnight mass from the where they are 
through the bars said sister eliane a carmelite who lives at the 
most blessed virgin mary of mount carmel but is not among the 13 
cloistered nuns 
theyll all be doing the same thing only they wont be doing 
them together 
the five nuns will watch the christmas midnight mass through two 
small openings covered by an iron gate in the infirmary which 
overlooks the darkened chapel of the monastery sister eliane said 
this week 
the rebel nuns locked themselves in the infirmary oct 4 to 
thwart what they say was their imminent eviction from the monastery 
they said their mother superior prioress mother teresa hewitt 
wanted them kicked out for speaking against such liberalizations as 
the introduction of television and sweets to the monastery 
mother teresa has said the dispute revolves around the barricaded 
nuns unwillingness to follow her orders 
vatican officials so far have declined comment 
the standoff at first was marked by a bitter media campaign with 
sister john of the cross one of the protesting nuns fielding 
reporters questions by telephone and sister teresa holding a news 
conference to lambaste the nuns attempted anarchy 
both sides have been virtually silent since 
meanwhile friends and family of the nuns are trying to make the 
holiday a little brighter 
the infirmary is decorated with a 2foot christmas tree adorned 
with red ribbons an advent wreath and small felt banners plastered 
with biblical passages sister eliane said 
theyre not down in the dumps or anything but theyre anxious 
to hear from rome she said of all the nuns who live at the 
monastery its obvious that its not going to be settled before 
the holidays were just hoping it wont be too long after the new 
year 
christmas dinner also will be segregated 
a man who caters a christmas meal of fish for the monastery each 
year will carry on a tradition that was started by his late brother 
a priest sister eliane said the donor whom she would not 
identify said he would provide dinner only if all the nuns share 
the food 
they will but theyll maintain their separate quarters sister 
eliane said 
christmas is christmas no matter what your problems are at the 
time she said we all plan on making the most of it

the american red cross has begun focusing on 
longterm plans to help earthquakestricken soviet armenia rebuild 
its destroyed and damaged health care facilities 
richard f schubert president of the american red cross said 
the pipeline of emergency aid supplies is full and flowing well and 
no further immediate aid is needed at this time 
priority attention is being given to the construction of a new 
general hospital he told a news conference friday the earthquake 
destroyed the only one killing all doctors and staff inside the 
building 
in a related development the office of presidentelect bush said 
his son and grandson are flying to soviet armenia over the christmas 
weekend to deliver toys and medical supplies to earthquake victims 
jeb bush 35 a miami real estate developer and his son george 
12 will spend about six hours in yerevan the armenian capital on 
christmas day 
the bushes are traveling to armenia as volunteers for americares 
a private relief agency that has chartered a dc8 cargo plane to 
transport supplies to the region when 55000 people were killed in 
the earthquake and about 500000 were left homeless 
schubert said the red cross has received 35 million in cash 
contributions and pledges for armenia disaster relief and that more 
money is coming in every hour 
he said the red cross will use the funds to help replace health 
and medical facilities that were destroyed by the dec 7 earthquake 
the red cross will be prepared to help fill any gaps that appear 
at the request of the soviet red cross he said 
schubert said priority longterm needs in armenia include 
the building of a general hospital to replace one that was 
totally destroyed in the quake 
the creation of a facility to make and install artificial limbs 
the establishment of a permanent tracking center to trace 
families of earthquake victims 
a disaster preparedness program to reduce deaths and injuries in 
the event of another earthquake in armenia 
the rebuilding and expansion of a destroyed school for 
handicapped children 
schubert who returned thursday from an inspection tour of the 
disaster areas in armenia said 27000 railroad cars of relief 
supplies have arrived so far in addition to 148 planes carrying 
emergency equipment 
he said soviet officials have been conscientious in keeping track 
of the incoming supplies they have promised to return expensive 
equipment to donors or to seek permission to use it elsewhere once 
it is no longer needed in armenia he said 
there have been reports of confusion and inept rescue efforts at 
the disaster scene but schuster said he believes the work went well 
given the immensity of the destruction and the relative inexperience 
of soviet officials in disaster relief 
given the size of the disaster i think they responded well 
he said its impossible to have a disaster site in which there is 
not confusion initially 
in addition he said it should be noted that in the first day or 
so all of the people present were affected they all lost family 
members 
the people displayed wonderful warmth and dignity schubert 
said time after time they expressed their thanks to the american 
public particularly to thank those in the americanarmenian 
community he said when they stopped to thank us on the streets 
the profusion of gratitude made it difficult to hold back tears 
theirs and ours 
schubert said the soviet red cross helped deal with the crisis 
effectively and offered all forms of cooperation to its american 
counterpart 
bad times bring good people together schubert said 
in addition to the 35 million in cash and pledges schubert 
said the american red cross has received more than 8 million worth 
of medical and other supplies and shipped them to armenia 
these include kidney dialysis machines blood collection bags 
plaster dressings needles and syringes finger splints bandages 
antiseptics sutures cervical collars antibiotics orthopedic 
pins ultrasound machines plastic eating utensils blankets and 
plastic sheeting

two of 17 lawsuits filed after the crash a 
continental airlines jetliner last year have been settled out of 
court according to court documents filed by fridays deadline 
continental flight 1713 crashed on takeoff during a snowstorm 
nov 15 1987 killing 28 of the 82 people on board and injuring 54 
the 15 remaining lawsuits are scheduled to go to trial beginning 
jan 9 
also friday us district judge sherman g finesilver denied 
motions from the airline for dismissal of punitive damage claims 
rejecting continentals contention that various provisions of the 
federal aviation act preempt traditional areas of state regulation 
he also ruled that texas law could be used to calculate damages 
rather than colorado law which more severely limits such damages 
continentals parent company texas air is based in houston 
details of the two settlements disclosed friday both of which 
involved passengers who survived but were seriously injured were 
not released 
initially 36 lawsuits were filed but several have been settled 
out of court and several other new suits have been filed 
lawyers for continental say denver airport officials are 
responsible for allowing snow and slush to build on the runway and 
that the federal aviation administration allowed flights to continue 
throughout the snowstorm 
continental also contends that the crash occurred because of 
swirling winds created by a jumbo jet that landed shortly before 
flight 1713 took off

the agriculture department has authorized the 
soviet union to begin a new round of subsidized wheat purchases from 
the united states 
acting undersecretary richard w goldberg said friday that moscow 
has been allocated 2 million metric tons of wheat under the 
departments export enhancement program or eep which allows 
designated foreign buyers to buy us commodities at cutrate prices 
the soviets bought about 9 million tons of wheat under eep 
arrangements during the 198788 year that ended sept 30 but so far 
has not ordered any for 198889 delivery 
goldberg also said the soviet union will be allowed to buy up to 
16 million tons of us grain in the 198889 year the limit under a 
recently extended agreement between the two countries was 12 million 
tons 
meanwhile the department said moscow has bought more corn which 
does not carry the eep subsidies both wheat and corn are included 
in the agreement 
the eep arrangement allows american exporters to sell wheat and 
other designated commodities to specified countries at reduced 
prices in order to meet foreign competition the exporters then 
collect free government surpluses of grain or other products as 
bonuses or subsidies 
earlier this week for example usda announced an eep wheat sale 
to china that carried a subsidy rate of 2310 per ton or about 63 
cents per bushel 
officials also said friday that the soviets bought an additional 
750000 tons of us corn bringing the total sold to 878 million 
tons in the agreements sixth year which began oct 1 
last year us corn sales to the soviet union totaled slightly 
less than 52 million tons wheat sales in 198788 all subsidized 
totaled slightly more than 9 million tons 
a metric ton is about 2205 pounds and is equal to 394 bushels 
of corn or 367 bushels of wheat or soybeans the 750000 tons of 
corn would be about 295 million bushels 
corn prices have been averaging about 261 per bushel at the 
farm level according to usda estimates meaning that the latest 
sale could have a farm value of around 77 million 
besides the corn and the likelihood of wheat for 198889 delivery 
under the pact the soviets have ordered 500000 tons of soybeans 
and 532500 tons of soybean meal plus 500000 tons of grain sorghum 
the united states and the soviet union on nov 28 signed an 
extension of the previous fiveyear grain agreement which had 
expired on sept 30 the extension of the previous pact will run 
through dec 31 1990

under pressure from congress the farmers home 
administration is easing some of the paperwork requirements for 
delinquent borrowers but it says a 45day deadline for responding 
to overdue notices wont change 
a growing number of lawmakers have been urging the agriculture 
department agency to extend the deadline which gives farmers 45 
days in which to respond after receiving official notices to begin 
settling overdue loan accounts 
the notices were sent out last month to more than 80000 
delinquent borrowers who owe fmha more than 8 billion 
theres just no way legally we can stretch it the deadline 
acting agency administrator la verne ausman said friday we must 
hear from the farmer within that time 
several basic response forms must be completed and returned 
within 45 days as the minimum requirement 
ausman said that in order to ease paperwork requirements for late 
repayers fmha county offices will accept supporting documents for 
the applications after the 45day deadline but that such agreements 
must be worked out with those offices 
the notices were sent out to fmha borrowers who were at least 180 
days delinquent in repaying loans the notices informed them of loan 
servicing and restructuring options and said failure to respond 
would trigger acceleration of loan collection a step toward 
foreclosure or forced sale of assets 
we have advised our field offices to use a test of 
reasonableness with borrowers who through no fault of their own 
are unable to complete all the forms on time ausman said 
for example he added if because of illness or other 
circumstances beyond his or her control a farmer couldnt obtain 
all the information he or she needed we wont be hardnosed if they 
have given us completed response forms and farm and home plans but 
we will be looking for evidence of a goodfaith effort on the part 
of the borrower to get all the forms in a timely manner 
ausman said that as a minimum the documents that must be sent in 
within 45 days include 
form fmha 4101 application for fmha services 
form fmha 4312 farm and home plan including the balance sheet 
attachment 2 acknowledgement of notice of program availability 
or attachment 4 response to notice informing me of fmhas intent to 
accelerate my loan

a scientific advisory panel says it has 
concerns about nasas efforts to continue improvements in the design 
of the space shuttles booster rockets 
h guyford stever chairman of the national research council 
panel said friday that although nasa has flown two successful 
missions since the 1986 challenger accident he has a broad 
concern that the space agency continue to monitor and evaluate the 
redesigned booster rockets 
success breeds confidence and thats what you want but it can 
also threaten you with complacency stever said in an interview 
he added i dont see complacency developing but i do know 
they have budget problems and how theyll solve that is difficult 
to say 
stevers panel in its final report delivered to nasa on 
wednesday cited two new problems with the redesigned boosters used 
in the sept 29 launch of the shuttle discovery 
small pieces of cork used to cover external diagnostic 
instruments and their electrical leads were lost during flight and 
one piece is believed to have damaged thermal tiles on the orbiter 
cork is also suspected of causing extensive damage to tiles on 
atlantis which was launched dec 2 
metaltometal seals were scratched and pitted stever said that 
removal of the seals could raise shuttle program costs but he said 
the scars were small and did not threaten safety 
the report also lists nine problem areas that need to be 
addressed before the redesign effort can be considered complete 
among the remaining tasks are strengthening of the conical base 
of the booster rocket more testing of booster segments to determine 
their potential to be reused safely improving materials for bonding 
booster parts developing alternative materials for oring seals and 
more testfiring at cold temperatures the report said 
in the challenger accident one of the orings between the 
booster segments failed allowing hot exhaust gases from the rocket 
to leak and cause the explosion that destroyed the shuttle and 
killed its crew of seven cold temperatures also contributed to the 
orings failure 
nasa said it will carefully consider all the groups 
recommendations 
stever said nasa officials have told him the agency has plans to 
carry out some of the tasks cited in the report including a 
coldweather test scheduled next month and is considering the 
others on the list 
the booster rockets worked for 24 flights before failing on the 
challenger mission stever pointed out referring to the redesigned 
booster rockets he said we dont consider it a bad design its 
just that things could be improved further 
the report also recommends several riskreduction steps 
including maintaining technically competent personnel familiar with 
booster design to evaluate and improve quality control assembly and 
launch operations and maintaining groundtesting and inflight 
performance measuring programs 
it also recommends insulating the budget for these safety 
activities from competitive pressures from other programs 
the panel of independent scientists was set up at the request of 
the white houseappointed rogers commission that investigated the 
challenger accident the commission asked the panel to monitor 
nasas compliance with its recommendations

twentyfive journalists were slain around the 
world in 1988 seven fewer than in 1987 but other forms of violence 
and intimidation against news gatherers increased according to a 
survey of press freedom 
during the year 225 journalists were arrested or detained in 
various countries and 24 expelled freedom house said friday in its 
annual survey 
fourteen were kidnapped or disappeared 28 wounded 90 beaten or 
otherwise assaulted 43 were targets of death threats and 12 had 
their homes raided or destroyed it said 
it said 40 newspapers or radio stations in 12 countries were 
closed and that nine were bombed burned or destroyed also more 
than 200 instances of lesser harassment occurred 
the antipress actions occurred in 70 countries compared with 57 
countries the year before 
the figures do not reflect other forms of official and 
unofficial editorial censorship and diverse methods of economic and 
political pressuring of the mass media said the survey report by 
leonard sussman a freedom house senior scholar 
the statistics are a clue however to those official actions 
which generate selfcensorship by journalists 
the figures for 1988 are as of dec 10 
the world survey rated press conditions as most free in 57 
countries including most states of the western alliance and 
least free in 83 including the communist bloc and much of the 
third world nineteen other countries were described as 
intermediary and included some of central america and scattered 
third world nations 
it said the united kingdom whose press is in the mostfree 
category was slipping by using its official secrets act to try to 
block publication of some stories 
it said that such leastfree nations as china the soviet union 
and hungary had improved by displaying more openness while remaining 
centrally controlled 
freedom house describes itself as a nonpartisan national 
organization that monitors political and civil rights and tries to 
strengthen free societies

the federal aviation administration has advised 
airports worldwide to tighten security because of concern not yet 
confirmed by investigators that a terrorist bomb may have caused 
the pan am crash in scotland 
faa administrator allan mcartor said friday the alert was 
prompted by the crash the heavy christmas travel period and what 
obviously can be considered a heightening of world tensions 
regarding terrorist activities 
the advisory to beef up security applies to both major us 
airports and airlines and foreign airports served by us carriers 
he said 
mcartor in an interview with reporters declined to discuss 
specifically wednesdays crash of pan am flight 103 in which all 
258 people aboard perished 
there has been widespread speculation and some preliminary 
indications that an explosion may have caused the crash although 
no clear evidence of terrorist involvement has yet to surface 
suspicions of sabotage were prompted by the unexplained sudden 
breakup of the plane a claim of responsibility and disclosures that 
the us government had been warned of a plot to bomb a pan am 
flight between frankfurt and new york in december the illfated 
flight 103 originated in frankfurt with a change of planes in 
london 
mcartor said pan am had imposed a very heightened level of 
security at frankfurt airport after the faa alerted the airline in 
early december that an anonymous threat had been received by the 
us embassy in helsinki finland from a caller who said a bomb 
would be planted aboard a pan am flight from frankfurt 
mcartor said pan ams precautions at londons heathrow airport 
from which flight 103 had departed 54 minutes before the crash were 
still under review british officials at the airport said they had 
not been notified about the specific threat 
at frankfurt mcartor said pan am briefed gate personnel about 
the possible threat kept ground baggage handlers and caterers 
under constant surveillance and checked all luggage by xray 
instead of only at random all passengers and their bags also were 
matched prior to boarding he said 
president reagan leaving the white house for a california 
vacation mourned the victims of the pan am disaster and asked 
americans to say a special prayer this christmas for families 
and friends of those killed in the crash 
meanwhile some aviation safety and crash investigation experts 
though not directly involved in the pan am investigation suggested 
that while the investigation in scotland may take months the cause 
of the crash is expected to be found 
it will be a massive job to reconstruct the pieces said 
ronald schleede chief of aviation accident investigation at the 
national transportation safety board but theyre going to solve 
it because the evidence will be there 
we will know what brought down pan am 103 mcartor said but 
he cautioned it could take months 
neither mcartor nor schleede who has been briefed daily by 
telephone by ntsb officials at the crash site would discuss 
specifically the pan am findings so far 
but schleede and other experts noted in interviews that the pan 
am crash investigators have some advantages 
for example 
most of the aircraft appeared to have escaped serious fire 
damage with the exception of a destroyed right wing where a fuel 
tank exploded 
in many crashes where a plane remains intact and burst into 
flames critical clues are lost because of the intense heat that 
bends metal and destroys evidence 
the wreckage although strewn across the countryside is not 
exposed to ocean elements that could destroy critical evidence if 
the plane had continued on course it would have been over the 
atlantic in less than an hour 
the cockpit voice recorder and flight data recorder were 
recovered in apparently good shape 
in the coming days investigators will pay close attention to how 
parts of the aircraft are bent tangled and singed and whether there 
is evidence of a chemical residue normally left by an explosive 
they also will search for fragments that might have been used as 
a detonator and closely examine luggage and parts of luggage as well 
as aircraft wreckage holes left by flying fragments such holes 
leave a distinctive pattern if caused by an explosion one expert 
said 
some of the wreckage will be reassembled as closely as possible 
to the original aircraft and metallurgists will try to determine how 
the pieces broke apart 
the flight data recorder which monitors the performance of the 
aircraft and the cockpit voice recorder will be examined further 
and their times coordinated a key question is whether all of the 
planes electrical systems were knocked out simultaneously one 
veteran investigator said 
it is known that flight 103 in rapid order lost its radar 
transponder radio contact and both flight and cockpit voice 
recorders this investigator said 
if all of these functions failed simultaneously there is strong 
evidence of a massive electrical failure possibly cause by an 
explosion near the forward baggage compartment which is adjacent to 
the electrical and computer systems on the boeing 747 experts 
suggested

chain he claims didnt give him any respect when it hired an actor 
to impersonate his voice in radio commercials 
the commercials for park inns international of irving texas 
carried a disclaimer that said the voice was an impersonation of 
dangerfield 
but the comedians lawsuit contends the disclaimer wasnt clear

filed recently in us district court 
daryl robertson an attorney for the chain was unavailable for

the seconddegree murder conviction of a 
woman who claimed the baby blues caused her to run over her 
infant son with a car was set aside friday by a judge who found the 
woman innocent by reason of insanity 
sheryl massip 24 who testified that postpartum depression 
drove her to kill the colicky constantly crying boy was not guilty 
of murder said superior court judge robert r fitzgerald 
i do not believe the prosecutions evidence established that 
she had the requisite mental state of malice aforethought the 
judge said he said while he knew his ruling was unusual he felt he 
had no choice 
unless overturned on appeal by the prosecution the judges 
ruling invalidates a nov 17 jury verdict of seconddegree murder 
which called for a sentence of 15 years to life 
fitzgerald delivered what he referred to as an unprecedented 
decision first reducing the charge against her from seconddegree 
murder to voluntary manslaughter then ruling that she was not 
guilty by reason of insanity the decision however still leaves 
the defendant eligible for commitment to a mental hospital for up to 
11 years 
this is new ground that we plowed today the judge said in an 
interview with the los angeles times after issuing his ruling i 
dont know of another court that came to a decision like the one i 
ded to set aside the jury verdict altogether 
i know people will say ive overstepped my bounds but the more 
i thought about it the more i realized i didnt have any choice but 
to find her insane she was bonkers 
mrs massip welcomed the verdict 
i was praying the people would understand she said outside 
court the jury did not understand but im thankful that the 
judge did 
mrs massip testified at the trial that on april 29 1987 her 
own 23rd birthday she hit her 6weekold son michael on the head 
with a garden tool then put him under the wheels of the family 
station wagon ran over him and put his body in a trash can 
defense witnesses said an exceptionally bad case of postpartum 
depression a hormonal ailment known as the baby blues was to 
blame defense attorney milton grimes said the young mother was 
wracked by lack of sleep and hallucinations and that she heard 
voices telling her to put the boy out of his misery

president jose azcona hoya said 
honduras may file a countersuit against nicaragua before the un 
international court of justice 
his accusation that nicaraguas sandinista army has intruded into 
honduran territory killing soldiers and civilians came after the 
court announced tuesday it will rule on a complaint filed by 
nicaragua against honduras on july 28 1986 
azcona said his country is ready to defend itself against 
nicaraguas accusation that honduras has aided the usbacked 
troops known as the contras by allowing them to use honduran 
territory as a staging ground for a war against the sandinista 
government 
azcona hoyo told reporters the decision by the court in the hague 
did not surprise him 
but he added we have enough proof that the sandinista army 
has entered honduran territory we have documented proof of 
numerous armed attacks and that have resulted in the death of 
honduran soldiers and civilians 
azcona hoya said the contras have taken refuge in honduras 
because they were driven there by the sandinista army he said they 
are not fighting in nicaragua now 
azcona hoyo said he considered the contras to be political 
refugees and predicted us aid for them would be renewed in 1989 
after george bush is inaugurated president

down here where folks wish you a joyeux 
noel instead of merry christmas santas sleigh gives way to 
papa noels cajun canoe and people build bonfires to light his way 
on christmas eve 
i dont know how that sleigh would run down here if it needs 
snow hed be in trouble i guess thats why he comes down the river 
in a pirogue a flatbottomed canoe said nolan j oubre the 
police and fire chief of gramercy 
gramercy has a population of 3600 except for christmas eve when 
upwards of 40000 people crowd into town for the lighting of the 
bonfires along the mississippi river levee oubre said 
for 260plus years the bonfires have blazed to guide papa noel 
down the mississippi to the small south louisiana communities about 
30 miles north of new orleans 
the bonfires are an old tradition passed on from my grandfather 
and his grandfather and all the other grandfathers i guess said 
the 65yearold oubre who has been in charge of building the 
bonfires for 50 years 
people began building the structures theyll torch on christmas 
eve almost a month in advance 
they used to be just simple teepees but about eight years ago 
people started getting real imaginative in what they made now its 
amazing to see what they come up with oubre said 
about 100 bonfires a year in the shape of riverboats plantation 
homes cabins and viking ships spring up on the river banks along a 
threemile stretch 
in fact the builders imaginations soared to such heights that 
size restrictions were imposed bonfires can be no larger than 
12feet wide and no taller than 25 feet 
those are about the only restrictions oubre said 
the crowds attracted by the celebration bring traffic that backs 
up for miles along state 44 but oubre said he doesnt consider it a 
problem 
it may be a problem for the folks in the cars but not for us 
they can only go about three or four miles an hour so its not 
dangerous and they can watch the bonfires just fine he reasoned 
not everyone will be stacked up in traffic at least six river 
boats will carry thousands of people upriver from new orleans to 
watch 
this is the second year weve done it and we sold out before 
we even advertised or planned it this year we added a third boat 
the river rose and still have better than 200 people on a waiting 
list said anna catherine viator spokeswoman for new orleans 
paddlewheels inc 
for between 35 and 55 those on the various ships get dinner 
champagne jazz and about an eighthour trip cruise officials said 
oubre and his 12man crew worked almost three weeks to build a 
38footlong pyre that looks like a shrimp boat they cut willow 
trees which he said burn best and make a beautiful fire and 
carefully assembled them 
oubre said watching his creations go up in smoke each year isnt 
sad in spite of the work and time that go into them 
no thats why you build them he said youve got it in 
mind all the time to see them burn so you look forward to that part 
most of all

bickering between nicaragua and 
honduras is threatening a summit planned for next month by central 
american leaders anxious to end the civil wars and hostilities in 
the region 
the latest stumbling block comes from the international court of 
justice at the hague netherlands the world court agreed this week 
to hear nicaraguas claims that honduras has been harboring and 
supporting usbacked rebels known as contras who are fighting 
nicaraguas leftist government 
honduran foreign minister carlos lopez contreras said wednesday 
the world courts decision threatens the future of negotiated 
settlements to the regions problems he said the courts move is 
politically charged and sets a judicial precedent totally 
incompatible with peace negotiations 
in addition president jose azcona hoyo of honduras has 
threatened to boycott regional peace talks unless nicaragua drops 
its world court case 
lopez and the foreign ministers of nicaragua el salvador 
guatemala and costa rica met earlier this month in mexico there 
they agreed that heads of state would convene in january in an 
effort to breathe new life into the stalled august 1987 peace plan 
the plan sets threemonth deadlines for ceasefires in el 
salvador nicaragua and guatemala 
it also mandates that governments of all five nations enact 
political amnesties and democratic freedoms and reconcile with 
political opposition groups it calls for an end to outside aid for 
rebel insurgencies and a ban on the use of one countrys territory 
to destabilize another 
the peace proposal was written by president oscar arias of costa 
rica who was awarded the 1987 nobel peace prize for his effort 
honduras says antigovernment nicaraguan rebels and refugees camp 
exist on honduran territory because of a lack of democratic freedoms 
in nicaragua 
for reasons of national security honduras doesnt want the 
contras lopez said nor do we desire the presence of more than 
60000 refugees from guatemala el salvador and nicaragua 
however lopez said honduras cannot eject the contras because 
we would be accused of being responsible for massacres and 
violating human rights 
lopez denounced what he called the sandinista practice of using 
international organizations to pressure other nations 
but nicaragua hailed the courts decision and nicaraguan 
president daniel ortega said honduras should accept it 
the same court ruled in nicaraguas favor in 1986 in a suit 
against us support of the contras the united states has refused 
to recognize the courts jurisdiction in the area 
as the main judicial organ of the united nations the court has 
no enforcement powers 
the arias plan sought to end the honduran problem as well as long 
wars in nicaragua el salvador and guatemala but the heady days 
following the 1987 signing later turned to disappointment and 
frustration 
the four us allies in central america el salvador honduras 
costa rica and guatemala blame nicaragua and its largest backer 
the soviet union for the persistent turmoil nicaragua says the 
united states is trying to militarize the region and find a pretext 
to invade nicaragua 
in both el salvador and guatemala talks between leftist 
guerrillas and the two usbacked governments have fallen apart 
wars rage on with no end in sight 
in san salvador on friday leftist rebels attacked the defense 
ministry with car bombs and explosives killing at least three 
people and wounding at least 35 officials said 
the assault on the military headquarters compound and on a nearby 
government health clinic appeared to be part of a major rebel 
offensive 
the regional talks did lead to a ceasefire agreement in 
nicaragua last march that sharply curtailed fighting there a month 
earlier the us government cut off military aid to the contras 
about 10000 contra fighters have now moved back to base camps in 
honduras the presidents last met in costa rica on jan 15 the date 
set by the arias plan to mark the end of the wars and full democracy 
instead they signed a statement vowing to continue their 
efforts el salvadors president jose napoleon duarte whose 
government is fighting growing rebel activity said further meetings 
would be useless unless concrete progress could be made

a crack addict desperate for treatment brought 
police his paraphernalia then smashed windows at two precincts 
before a judge relented and sentenced him to a drug program he calls 
his best christmas gift yet 
i will thank him for giving me an opportunity for starting my 
life back over he is an understanding man one of very few 
alexis vega said friday of bronx criminal court judge john moore 
vega 34 said his life had bordered on the insane until moore 
sentenced him to 90 days in a drug treatment program as a crack 
cocaine addict vega lost his job as a construction worker he 
stopped paying bills he became irresponsible and dirty his wife of 
two years josephine coulter feared for their 11monthold son and 
her two daughters now 12 and 13 
last july miss coulter threw him out of their home in new york 
citys tough south bronx section because i was doing wrong he 
said she is a christian and i didnt want to be around her 
its bad to see a good husband turn into a monster ive known 
him nine years and i had never seen that side of him miss coulter 
said i was praying he would get into a program before it was too 
late he was getting out of hand 
vega knew he was getting out of hand so he turned for help he 
applied for admission at several bronx hospital programs and one in 
manhattan 
they all told me they were filled up until february or the end 
of january that was too far for me to look forward to vega said 
on oct 28 he sought help from the desk sergeant at the 47th 
precinct that did not work so vega tried something else he placed 
a syringe and some crack vials on the sergeants desk 
i didnt know what else to do vega said they roughed me 
up they were very shocked that i did this they didnt understand 
and neither did the judge who handled the case releasing him two 
days later without sending him to treatment 
on nov 5 vega tossed a chair through the window of the 48th 
precinct another judge put him in the streets without treatment

the search for survivors of the 
armenian earthquake is over and crews will now focus solely on 
clearing away tons of concrete and debris so rebuilding can begin a 
government official said 
no one has been found alive in the mountains of bricks 
splintered wood and steel since thursday when workers pulled a 
woman from what used to be a building in leninakan she later died 
we did everything to sift the ruins to save the lives of 
whomever might be under them at this time we know that no one can 
be alive vardkes artsruny a deputy prime minister of armenia 
said in an interview friday 
the gigantic problem now is the cleanup he said speaking in 
makeshift offices previously used as a childrens center 
lights in the twostory relief headquarters sputtered as he spoke 
because of the varying levels of power provided by portable 
generators during a blackout friday he met with agricultural 
officials by candlelight 
fields around leninakan whose shoddy buildings collapsed when 
the earth shook dec 7 are filled with debris twisted wire and 
remains of stairs protrude from piles of formless rubble trucked 
from the armenian republics secondlargest city 
rescuers said a 16yearold boy was found alive monday 12 days 
after the quake in the remains of a ninestory building a bed 
apparently shielded him from tons of concrete raining down 
one of the boys arms was broken he asked rescuers to bandage 
his eyes so he wouldnt be blinded when exposed to light after so 
many days 
leninakan on a mountain plateau near the turkish border had a 
population of 280000 before the quake about 18000 people were 
found in the ruins 8000 of whom survived 
survivors taking part in the rescue aided by 20000 workers from 
elsewhere in the soviet union and 15000 soldiers live in heated 
tents sent from the russian republic and in yurts shepherds tents 
sent by kazakhs and mongols 
workers have nearly completed disinfecting and burying about 
80000 carcasses of cattle sheep and pigs killed in villages the 
official news agency tass reported 
in a dispatch today tass estimated agricultural damage to 
armenia at about 32 billion of 342 populated areas in the quake 
zone 58 were destroyed tass said 
government officials have said leninakan spitak and the dozens 
of other cities and towns of northwestern armenia destroyed by the 
quake will be rebuilt in two years but artsruny said it may take 
longer 
its not important that we reconstruct leninakan in two years 
and three months he said its the fact that were doing it 
izvestia the government newspaper said friday authorities had 
not decided whether to rebuild leninakan and spitak on the same 
sites or move them to nearby spots less susceptible to earthquakes 
the quake has brought world figures to armenia as well as 
rescuers 
presidentelect george bushs son and grandson are scheduled to 
visit armenia on christmas day to help distribute american aid jeb 
bush 35 a miami real estate developer and his 12yearold son 
george will spend about six hours in yerevan according to bushs 
office in washington 
most armenians are devout christians but like other members of 
eastern churches will celebrate christmas on jan 6 
us aid has come in many forms american volunteers are putting 
up 100 plastic shelters at spitak and tass said american 
seismologists were establishing 25 earthquake monitoring stations in 
the area of the quakes epicenter 
in washington the american red cross said it would shift its 
effort from immediate to longterm assistance including buiding a 
hospital president richard f schubert said the red cross has 
received 35 million in cash contributions and pledges

the trampling deaths and suffocations of 73 
people on christmas eve remain a touchy subject in this town even 
though the tragedy occurred 75 years old today 
i dont suppose it will ever heal said amateur historian 
jack foster a resident of calumet 
it happened when a false fire alarm was sounded during a party 
for children in 1913 at the height of a bitter strike at copper 
mines in michigans upper peninsula 
the death certificates blame persons unknown and some of the 
stories are so insidious that i understand why over the years people 
in the town didnt want to talk about it said peggy germain a 
former calumet council member 
even so the town council voted tuesday to hold a memorial 
service today at the site where the hall once stood planned are a 
nondenominational prayer service a candlelight vigil and the 
reading of the victims names 
nobody ever discovered who sounded the false alarm foster said 
union and company supporters blamed each other for the strike 
violence they attributed to the disaster 
unionized members of the western federation of miners had been on 
strike for 10 months over the calumet and hecla mining cos 
decision to switch from twoman drills to oneman drills the wfm 
contended the new drill was unsafe 
in june 1913 more than 14000 unionized miners and 1500 mill 
and smelter workers were laid off as calumet and hecla moved to 
reopen its mines with nonunion workers according to an account by 
historian angus murdock 
that fall two company guards chased a striker into a boarding 
house in calumet and fired gunshots killing two men the guards 
claimed they had been shot at first 
then on dec 7 three nonunion canadian miners were gunned down 
as they slept in a second boarding house days later a miner and a 
guard were killed in another shootout 
it was in that atmosphere that the wfm womens committee held a 
christmas party for the children of striking miners on the second 
floor of calumets italian hall above a saloon 
the party was under way witnesses said when someone from the 
first floor stairwell shouted out a fire alarm 
children and adults panicked to escape tripping over each other 
to get into the stairwell and out the only exit witnesses said 57 
children and 16 adults were crushed to death or suffocated before 
anyone realized what was happening 
i was so scared said lena rigotti an 88yearold hurley 
wis nursing home resident who survived the tragedy i told my 
sister stay with me and well get home i dont know how we ever 
made it 
national guard troops were ordered out to keep the peace and a 
congressional investigation was held the wfm called a halt to the 
strike that next spring

authorities say 18 victims in one of the 
nations longest string of deaths caused by china white a powerful 
synthetic heroin were at the mercy of dealers who dont check the 
quality of drugs they sell 
theres no way to prevent this allegheny county coroner 
joshua perper said anybody who has the knowledge to produce a 
socalled designer drug can cause this sort of thing 
the drug 3methylfentanyl has been confirmed as the cause of 18 
overdose deaths in the pittsburgh area perper said laboratory 
tests are under way for five others the drug also is suspected in 
as many as 60 nonfatal overdoses 
our information from the street is that dealers marketed it 
as a real powerful heroin pittsburgh assistant police chief 
chester howard said they had no idea of its potency three 
granules are enough for one dose we consider it one of the most 
powerful drugs known 
twelve people have been arrested including thomas l schaefers 
48 of suburban aspinwall a calgon corp chemist suspected as the 
source of the narcotic 
the deaths were the longest series of china white fatalities 
outside california where the drug surfaced 11 years ago 
this is really the first major incident outside of california 
from a clandestine laboratory putting material on the street said 
gary henderson professor of pharmacology at the university of 
californiadavis medical school and its certainly the most 
fentanyl activity weve seen since 1984 
henderson developed a method of testing for the presence of china 
white and drugs with similar compositions fentanyl analogs in 
overdose victims and is helping city county and federal officials 
in pittsburgh with their investigation 
china white also called persian heroin and gasoline dope is 
several hundred times more powerful than heroin and even extremely 
small amounts can be fatal it can be manufactured by anyone with a 
background in college chemistry according to the national institute 
on drug abuse in rockville md 
federal authorities first noticed the presence of china white in 
december 1979 when two users died in california henderson said 
henderson said 115 have people died from fentanyl overdoses in 
california arizona and oregon since 1980 the number of annual 
deaths in california peaked at 50 in 1984 just before the us drug 
enforcement administration cracked a drug ring in los angeles 
eighteen people died there in 1985 and one died in 1986 
most of the dead in the pittsburgh area were men in their 30s who 
took the drug either by itself or with heroin and cocaine perper 
said authorities began investigating after noticing a rash of fatal 
and nonfatal overdoses in september october and november 
seven people were arrested dec 1 including schaefers who lived 
with his elderly parents and had no record of prior involvement with 
illegal drugs investigators said 
all seven were charged with manufacturing and distributing the 
drug four were charged with supplying the dose that killed jay a 
duschl 38 of verona on june 2 and injured brenda drennan 29 
formerly of harmar on may 22 three are charged with selling the 
dose that killed daniel kostopodis 41 of bellevue on july 24 
five others suspected to be lowerlevel dealers were arrested in 
november 
schaefers has been suspended without pay pending results of the 
investigation calgon spokesman tom erdner said

an internationally acclaimed 
ecologist who led a fight to save brazils tropical forests was 
ambushed and killed in a remote jungle village police said 
the victim 44yearold francisco mendes said two weeks ago that 
his life had been threatened 
mendes was shot thursday night when he stepped outside his home 
in xapuri a western village near the bolivian border said federal 
police chief mauro sposito 
mendes was playing dominos with friends and two police bodyguards 
assigned to care for him when he went to take a shower in an outdoor 
stall sposito said in a telephone interview from rio branco 2650 
miles northwest of rio de janeiro 
moments later mendes was shot once in the upper chest with a 
rifle at pointblank range the chief said the killers fled before 
the bodyguards could leave the house he said 
the shooting occurred a halfblock from the local police precinct 
police made no arrests and said there were no definite suspects 
there was no way to stop them the killers nilson alves a 
xapuri police officer told the associated press by telephone it 
was starting to get dark we only had one search lamp and the 
jungle is pretty thick in these parts 
mendes was known worldwide for leading a campaign against amazon 
rain forest destruction he was a representative for the world bank 
in washington and other international lending institutions in 
britain and west germany and tried to stop loans to brazil for 
development of the region 
mendes said he received repeated death threats for organizing 
demonstrations against deforestation of the amazon rain forest by 
cattle ranchers and was under local police protection 
in june 1987 he was honored by the united nations for leading 
members of a local union in a fight to preserve the amazon jungle 
the rubber tappers union often staged peaceful empate or 
stalemate demonstrations by standing in front of bulldozers with 
family members and friends in areas where acres of forestland were 
being cleared for grazing 
two union members were fatally shot in october 
on dec 9 mendes told a news conference in rio de janeiro he had 
received death threats from darly and alvarnho alves brothers and 
ranch owners who had past conflicts with the rubber tappers union 
the debate over how to develop the amazon jungle a vast expanse 
of rain forest about twofifths the size of the continental united 
states has led to frequent violence 
land disputes involving squatters environmentalists and 
landowners have caused about 250 deaths a year since 1985 
mendes who is survived by a wife and two children is to buried 
today in xapuri

a murder conviction returned against a 
mother who admitted killing her ailing son by running him over with 
a car was rejected by a judge who said the woman was driven insane 
by postchildbirth depression 
superior court judge robert r fitzgerald in announcing his 
ruling said he believed sheryl massip 24 was made insane by what 
some health experts call postpartum depression or baby blues 
i know people will say ive overstepped my bounds fitzgerald 
told a stunned orange county courtroom as he announced the decision 
friday but the more i thought about it the more i realized i 
didnt have a choice but to find her insane she was bonkers 
prosecutors said they will review whether an appeal can be filed 
on grounds that fitzgeralds ruling went beyond his authority 
we believe on a cursory review of material that he exceeded 
his authority deputy district attorney tom borris said we 
believe the best that he could have done is order a new trial 
borris also said fitzgerald didnt first inform attorneys about 
his decision as judges often do when they are about to issue a 
reversal 
the judge said afterward that he had not decided what the ruling 
would be until the moment he delivered it 
ms massip 24 had been convicted of seconddegree murder 
fitzgerald reduced the charge to voluntary manslaughter but then 
ruled that she was not guilty by reason of insanity essentially 
negating the voluntary manslaughter conviction 
she still faces a maximum sentence of 11 years confinement in a 
mental hospital her jury conviction called for 15 years to life in 
prison 
the judge ordered ms massip to surrender feb 3 for at least 90 
days of psychiatric observation he then will decide if she needs 
further treatment 
ms massips family burst into cheers after the decision which 
came during a hearing originally scheduled for her sentencing on the 
murder conviction 
i couldnt have asked god for a better christmas present 
said ms massip who read a bible before the decision i got the 
gift of life 
her former husband alfredo massip whom she testified refused to 
help care for the child fled the court in tears and refused to talk 
to reporters he divorced ms massip shortly after her arrest 
during her trial ms massip admitted killing her 6week old son 
michael but she testified that the child cried 15 to 18 hours a 
day adding that she heard voices telling her to put the infant out 
of his misery 
experts summoned to testify by her lawyer said she had a severe 
case of postpartum depression brought on by hormonal imbalance 
sometimes associated with childbirth 
the rare disorder is believed to spur severe anxiety delusions 
and even violence in approximately three of every 1000 new mothers 
on april 29 1987 ms massips 23rd birthday she tried to toss 
the child in front of a car near her fullerton home but the driver 
swerved and missed him 
she then beat the infant on the head and finally placed him 
faceup under the tire of her volvo station wagon and ran him over 
after the killing she first told investigators the child had 
been stolen by a redhaired mystery woman with a gun 
but the childs body was found in a trash can 
the pain hasnt gone away i have to live with the death of my 
son the loss of my son for the rest of my life ms massip said 
after the ruling i pray that this doesnt happen to anyone else 
the judges decision came after an impassioned plea from defense 
attorney milton grimes 
theres nothing in human experience that can justify what 
sheryl massip did other than the fact that she was crazy at the 
time grimes argued

british transportation minister paul 
channon is vacationing in the caribbean drawing angry cries from 
home because his department is in charge of investigating the pan am 
jet crash in scotland 
it is unbelievable said john prescott of britains 
opposition labor party on friday after channon left for barbados 
channon and his wife ingrid made no comment after landing later 
friday in bridgetown 
channon was seen checking in with mustique airways and was 
believed to be flying to mustique a tiny island about 40 miles away 
that is a popular and exclusive getaway spot 
it is quite intolerable and totally insensitive for the 
transport secretary to leave for his holidays so soon after 
britains worst aviation disaster when bodies are still being 
retrieved and a major security review is under way said prescott 
his partys transport spokesman 
investigators are still searching for dozens of bodies and for 
clues to what caused pan am flight 103 to break apart in the air 
wednesday night the boeing 747 plummeted into the scottish village 
of lockerbie killing all 258 people on board and leaving 20 people 
on the ground missing and feared dead 
the british embassy in barbados said it had no information on 
channons visit because he was not on official business 
in london the trade ministry said channon would be kept informed 
on the investigation and planned to return soon after christmas but 
would fly home earlier if necessary 
prescott said margaret thatcher the conservative prime minister 
should call him back immediately and declared such lack of 
judgment should justify his removal 
geoffrey dickens a conservative member of parliament said labor 
was trying to make capital out of other peoples misery and 
death

investigators today were analyzing a 
faint noise heard in the final moments of a cockpit taperecording 
for clues to whether a bomb downed pan am flight 103 while it was 
flying six miles above scotland 
there were no abnormal noises on the tape until the signals 
ended abruptly with the aircraft cruising at 31000 feet said 
paul mckie a spokesman for the department of transport whose air 
accident investigation branch is studying the tapes 
nothing in the cockpit conversations preceding the wednesday 
night crash was unusual until the faint noise at the end which 
needs a bit more analysis he said 
nbc news quoted unidentified us officials as saying the top cia 
official in beirut lebanon was on the jet the report friday night 
did not name the cia official and the white house and state 
department refused comment on whether a cia official was on the 
plane 
the search continued today for bodies and clues and police said 
there would be no break for christmas 
david learmount a respected aviation editor at flight 
international the industry magazine said the black box 
recording supported the theory that a bomb caused the crash which 
killed all 258 people aboard and devastated the scottish village of 
lockerbie with its flaming wreckage 
twenty townspeople were missing and feared dead including 
drivers of three cars caught in the inferno 
the black boxes have told us that it was an instantaneous 
catastrophe that is why the bomb theorys very much the favorite 
learmount told independent television news on friday night 
the bomb theory explains everything which happened if this 
case was just simple metal fatigue failure it would have had to 
have been cataclysmic really extraordinarily unlikely but if it 
did happen we really have to know and know fast he said 
but mick charles head of a team of 40 us and british 
investigators at the site said we have no evidence whatsoever 
yet of sabotage 
strong suspicions of a terrorist bombing built swiftly following 
an iranian groups claim of responsibility the revelation that the 
us government had been warned of a threat against a pan am plane 
and the fact the plane suddenly broke apart in flight 
anger at the governments failure to notify the public of the 
threat against a pan am jet flying from frankfurt to new york 
sometime in december surfaced friday when it became known the 
united states notified britain 
the governments reticence meant the poor ignorant traveling 
public taking greater risks charged john prescott of the 
opposition labor party anthony beaumontdark of the governing 
conservatives agreed 
transport minister michael portillo responding to the criticism 
said the threat phoned in to the us embassy in helsinki on dec 
5 was confidential classified us intelligence information and 
we didnt have the right to divulge it 
heathrow airports security for american flights was reviewed and 
determined to be strict enough not to warrant divulging the 
anonymous threat portillo said on british broadcasting corp 
television 
victims relatives began to arrive in lockerbie a community of 
2500 to claim their dead seven americans were among the arrivals 
who were being counseled by social workers 
makeshift morgues in the town hall and in an ice rink have 
received 155 bodies and the search goes on 
wreaths appeared outside the morgues one bouquet from a 
passenger who took flight 103 from frankfurt to london was to a 
child flying on to new york 
to the little girl in the red dress who lies here who made my 
flight from frankfurt such fun you didnt deserve this the note 
said 
officers hacked open the nose section of the plane which lay on 
its side in a field and troops carried away the bodies of the crew 
fourteen adults and three children from lockerbie remained 
unaccounted for and there was no word on the occupants of three cars 
hit by wreckage and gutted on a nearby highway police 
superintendent angus kennedy said 
the missing toll had been 22 but one man was found to have been 
treated for injuries wednesday and released and another was 
accidentally listed twice as missing 
more than 600 troops and police assisted by rescue experts and 
dogs crisscrossed wide areas of the countryside looking for bodies 
and any fragment that might help explain the crash 
an air india jumbo jet bound for new york with 250 people aboard 
returned to london on friday afternoon after air india in new york 
received an anonymous bomb threat officials said 
it was evacuated at heathrow but the airline announced nothing 
suspicious was immiedately found passengers were offered seats on a

the palestine liberation organization and 
the shiite moslem amal militia have reached a new peace pact to end 
their bloody 3year conflict beirut newspapers reported today 
the papers published the 11point pact which is the sixth since 
1985 when amal moved against palestinian refugee camps to prevent 
plo chairman yasser arafat from rebuilding a power base in lebanon 
the five earlier accords fell apart and there is widespread 
doubt the latest accord will hold 
more than 3000 people have been killed and 10000 wounded in the 
amalplo conflict 
amal has an estimated 10000 armed militiamen the plo has 4500 
guerrillas based in the sidon region 25 miles south of beirut 
syria which supports amal last month withdrew 66 truce 
observers from the highlands east of sidon that raised fears of 
major clashes but so far only localized skirmishes have occurred 
the new pact provides for a disengagement of forces and the 
removal of frontline barricades to enforce a ceasefire between amal 
and the plo around sidon provincial capital of south lebanon 
the conflict has centered on the city and its environs since 
arafats fighters were driven out of their strongholds in beiruts 
refugee camps by rival syrianbacked palestinian factions in july 
something amal had failed to do 
amal and the plo pledged in the accord to resolve friction by 
peaceful means and reopen all roads in the region for unrestricted 
movement 
the accord stipulated that amal should lift its 3year siege of 
the rashadiyeh refugee camp in the southern port of tyre about 
18000 palestinians live there 
it also provided for repairing the devastation in sidons ein 
elhilweh and mieh mieh camps and repatriating thousands of 
displaced palestinians and shiites in the region 
the leftist sunni moslem nasserite militia which has stayed 
neutral in the amalplo conflict will oversee the new ceasefire

one thousand homeless people sleeping in 
chilly skid row doorways and on grimy sidewalks were awakened in the 
middle of the night by police only to find the officers were 
bearing blankets instead of billy clubs 
the officers were among the host of americans playing santa claus 
at christmastime including a cigarpuffing mercedesbenz driver who 
passed out thousands of dollars to skid row denizens here and a man 
who bailed eight prisoners out of a new york state jail 
los angeles police capt carley mitchell bought special 
waterproof insulating blankets with 240 of his own money then 
passed them out early friday to the street dwellers many of whom 
had little more than strips of cardboard to protect them 
i was hoping i could keep some people warm for the holidays and 
make christmas a little better for them said mitchell who runs 
the police departments training academy 
mitchell said he staged the giveaway in the middle of the night 
to make sure the blankets got to those who really needed them and to 
avoid the news media 
i didnt want it to be any big deal just a concerned citizen 
in street clothes doing something on his own time he said 
later friday in skid row a hoard of homeless people were handed 
10 bills by a selfstyled santa puffing a stogie driving a 
mercedesbenz and wearing a bright red threepiece suit and a 
crimson fedora 
the giveaway at the midnight mission came a day after the seventh 
annual visit there by a secretive philanthropist known as the 
cadillac santa who also hands out cash 
the guy in the mercedes said he read about the cadillac santa 
and thought he could do better said mission spokesman clancy 
imislund 
however the cadillacdriving benefactor spent about twice as 
much as the 3000 or so his imitator handed out imislund said 
imislund said the mercedes santas red suit red tie and red 
fedora were the most godawful getup you could imagine but his 
heart was in the right place and nobody cared what he was wearing 
he was hohohoing like nobodys business and just like the 
other one wouldnt reveal who he is the spokesman said 
in manhasset ny just east of new york city sal miglio spent 
2000 to bail out seven women and one man who would otherwise have 
spent christmas in the nassau county jail and gave them a choice of 
toys to bring home to their children 
to be in jail just because you cant make bail of a couple of 
hundred dollars just doesnt make sense said miglio a 
55yearold developer playing good samaritan for the 14th year in a 
row 
the prisoners were chosen through interviews with miglio and by 
recommendations from jail workers counselors and police the crimes 
involved are usually petty larceny trespassing or shoplifting said 
sheriff joseph jablonsky 
at the indiana state prison in michigan city ind inmates 
collected 1700 to buy more than 1000 christmas toys for needy 
children in hospitals and elsewhere in town 
were saying just because were here that doesnt mean we 
dont have a heart said inmate billy hicks who is chairman of 
the toy project 
the prisoners raised the money through donations and by 
collecting aluminium cans for sale at a recycling site said hicks 
in some way i would say that just about every one of the 1600 
or so men in the prison population helped with the project he 
said weve been working on this since about july

prime minister noboru takeshitas bid to reform the 
tax system today cleared its last hurdle when the upper house of 
parliament passed the measures after 24 hours of delaying tactics by 
opposition parties 
the new laws give japan a 3 percent sales tax and reduce its 
heavy reliance on direct taxes by cutting corporate and upperlevel 
income taxes the legislation is to take effect april 1 
opposition parties introduced censure motions against takeshita 
and four other government officials friday afternoon and then 
shuffled to the podium at a snails pace to delay voting 
the tactics carried parliament through its first overnight 
session in 13 years opposition parties have blocked previous 
attempts by other premiers to overhaul the tax system which was 
drafted by us occupation authorities in the lean years after 
japans defeat in world war ii 
voting on the tax bills took place more than 24 hours after the 
censure motions were introduced legislators from the japan 
socialist and japan communist parties left the chamber in a show of 
protest and the bills were quickly approved by the majority liberal 
democrats 
since the takeshita administration formally submitted the tax 
reform package to parliament in july opposition legislators led by 
the japan socialist party and japan communist party have boycotted 
sessions demanding the government first fully investigate a 
highlevel stocktrading scandal 
the scandal involving takeshita and other top officials who 
profited from questionable sales of unlisted stocks bought at 
bargain prices has led to the resignations of politicians business 
leaders and media executives including finance minister kiichi 
miyazawa who stepped down on dec 9 
takeshita took over the finance portfolio then 
tatsuo murayama was one of the chief architects of the tax reform 
package 
a former finance ministry bureaucrat he is a considered a tax 
specialist and played a leading role in the liberal democratic 
partys tax review committee which he has chaired since 1985 
the communist party and local business groups on friday protested 
the sales tax at a rally in takeshitas hometown 
about 100 people shouting destroy the tax bill and calling 
for the resignation of the cabinet marched near the takeshita 
familys sake brewery in kakeaicho in western shimane prefecture 
organizer jiro wada said 
a study by the shimouma consumers cooperative association a 
tokyo consumers group says that under the new tax plan a typical 
fourmember household with an annual income of 53225 will pay 
1305 less in income and residents taxes but the new sales tax 
will cost it an additional 500

americans who lost loved ones on pan 
am flight 103 visited the disaster site today and police questioned 
whether more than 100 bodies still missing will ever be found 
american joe horgan said he had been out across the search area 
near this scottish village this morning 
i think you feel better once you actually see the site for 
yourself said horgan who spoke at a news conference on condition 
that his hometown and details about his relative aboard the flight 
were not disclosed 
he said he came to lockerbie first and foremost to assist in 
the identification process of the bodies and for our personal need 
to be near our loved one 
as more than 600 police troops and rescue workers combed 
lockerbie and a wide area of the surrounding countryside for the 
third day today police said there would be no halt for christmas 
nothing will change over christmas said police spokesman 
angus kennedy the search will go on and on there are no plans at 
all to scale down the search operation 
but it was uncertain whether the missing bodies would be found 
we will not be able to answer that question for many days 
kennedy said friday night after the second full day of searching 
bodies of 155 people killed wednesday when a pan am boeing 747 
slammed into the village of lockerbie have been placed in two 
temporary mortuaries 
but the approximately 20 relatives who have arrived in lockerbie 
have been unable to see any of the bodies because none has been 
positively identified 
horgan said experts were using comparative information from 
bodies they have found to try to identify them 
any little piece of information whether it be clothing 
articles anything at all would definitely help the process come to 
a speedy conclusion horgan said 
asked about the mental state of the relatives who flew to britain 
from the united states he said you run quite a gamut of emotions 
grief loss frustration anger the anger he said was related 
to conjectures about the cause of the disaster 
tom mcmenamay the local director of social work said that 
increasing numbers of relatives were arriving in lockerbie without 
advance notice

lockerbie and had been briefed by police he offered no details 
about the visits 
police were not discouraging relatives from coming kennedy said

the streets of bethlehem 
were nearly deserted today as hundreds of israeli soldiers set up 
checkpoints to prevent christmas violence 
as christmas eve began in the biblical town the bishop of 
jerusalem entered the church of the nativity which marks the site 
where the bible says jesus was born amid the smoke of incense and a 
crowd of israeli security men 
the bishop michel sabbah was greeted in raindrenched manger 
square by the israeli military governor of bethlehem lt col 
shaltiel lavy and the citys palestinian mayor elias freij 
christian pilgrims seemed to be outnumbered by hundreds of 
israeli police and troops and dozens of journalists as sabbah was 
greeted under a tradition that goes back to when the region was 
governed by british and turkish rulers 
sabbah the roman catholic patriarch was led into the church in 
a procession headed by the traditional moslem guides in red fezzes 
banging large canes on the ancient stones outside the church 
holy water was sprinkeld at the door of the church as sabbah 
entered surrounded by other church officials and altar boys 
israeli police formed a path holding hands to keep back 
journalists and others trying to get a glimpse of sabbah in his red 
robe 
freij said that despite the sparse number of tourists during the 
day he expected that st catherines church next to the church of 
the nativity and where midnight mass will be said would be full of 
pilgrims by evening 
asked about his message to the world on christmas eve freij said 
we say to god on the highest peace on earth my message is 
that we want peace with our israeli neighbors so both arabs and jews 
can live in peace and security as good friends as free people as 
equal people 
only one coffee stand was open in manger square the other 
restaurants and tourist shops closed because of a strike declared by 
the plobacked leaders of the yearold uprising against israels 
occupation 
security was tight around manger square anyone wanting to enter 
had to pass through metal detectors and be searched by israeli 
security men 
the rev stephen doyle a franciscan priest from a nearby 
ecumenical research center said he thought the security might 
discourage palestinian christians from attending midnight mass many 
arab christians have said they will not attend mass because of the 
strike 
leaders of the palestinian uprising have asked christian arabs to 
boycott mass to show their solidarity with the more than 330 people 
who have been killed during the rebellion fourteen israelis also 
have been slain 
we will punish everybody who leaves his house said a slogan 
painted in red on one town wall lets make this day a mourning 
day for our martyrs said another which was signed by the proplo 
underground leadership 
freij and other city officials decided to cancel a traditional 
parade by boy scouts during the evening ceremonies in sympathy with 
the uprising 
this is christmas but there will be no celebration or 
decorations and the christmas trees will not be put up freij said 
on israel radio 
the whole mood of the west bank is one of anger sorrow 
frustration and anxiety he said 
doyle was asked if he thought the cancellation of festivities was 
a good idea on christmas eve 
i think they are right on target said the philadelphiaborn 
priest there is a memory to celebrate but the present reality is 
very depressing 
jean holladay a visitor from wheelock vt said she thought the 
heavy media and security presence interfered with the holiday spirit 
i think the situation here has a numbing effect on christmas 
she said all i see now are tv people and soldiers 
in nablus 25 miles north of bethlehem a 21yearold arab man 
who was shot in the head by soldiers during a demonstration last 
week died of his wounds 
a 55yearold man from the nearby village of ijah was shot in the 
left leg during a demonstration today 
in the gaza strip stores were shut and the army closed three 
schools after students set up rock barricades in the street and 
pelted soldiers with stones 
a 15yearold boy from gazas jebaliya refugee camp was shot in 
the right leg after a clash with troops he was taken to ahli arab 
hospital and discharged after the bullet was removed

the southern province of guangdong has held 
communist chinas first civil service examination and 11000 of the 
120000 applicants were selected for government employment a report 
said today 
the examination in september was reminiscent of the system used 
in imperial china where civil servants also were selected through 
tests 
in presentday china however the functions of communist party 
and government officials often overlap and political connections 
frequently play a role in obtaining jobs and promotions 
last year communist party chief zhao ziyang proposed a civil 
service system suggesting government employees not engaged in 
political work should obtain jobs on the basis of an examination 
and wages and promotions should depend on merit 
the idea of giving priority to seniority and other wornout 
concepts that stifle peoples initiative and creativity should be 
eradicated he said 
the guangdong examination was a prelude to the civil service 
system said the independent ming pao newspaper quoting the 
progovernment china news service 
the examination was adminstered to 120000 people in an open 
fair and competitive manner the report said 
about 11000 applicants passed the examination including 
workers high school and university graduates and 3000 people from 
rural areas the report said it did not give a breakdown of 
participants by age or sex 
the new employees will work in provincial departments including 
security courts finance and revenue the report said

an oil tanker with 34 men aboard broke 
its mooring and drifted for five hours in the stormy north sea today 
before two tugboats chased it down and began towing it back to 
scotland 
the tugboats attached lines to the tanker about 200 miles east of 
the port of dundee a coast guard spokesman in aberdeen said 
the tankers engines were removed when it was permanently moored 
in the north sea as a storage facility where smaller tankers picked 
up oil so it drifted in strong winds and turbulent seas 
the vessel was moored at a loading point in the fulmar oil field 
when it broke from its mooring about 530 am in 15foot waves and 
60 mph winds and began drifting to the southeast said the

premier nikolai i ryzhkov considered a stodgy 
technocrat has suddenly been thrust into the public eye during the 
disaster caused by the armenian earthquake 
the soviet unions dynamic leader president mikhail s 
gorbachev has retreated into an unusual silence and been absent 
from public view after making a brief trip to armenia 
ryzhkov went to armenia the morning after the dec 7 earthquake 
until he returned to moscow last week ryzhkov received heavy 
coverage in the staterun media doing the things soviets have come 
to expect from the more voluble gorbachev 
ryzhkov directed the machinery of government in full view of tv 
cameras hugged homeless armenians and met crowds on street corners 
gorbachev by contrast rushed home from new york spent a stormy 
weekend in armenia and has not been seen in public since dec 11 
there were no indications that ryzhkovs prominence and 
gorbachevs absence signaled any realignment in the kremlin or that 
gorbachev was ill but it was suddenly ryzhkov who represented the 
kremlin throughout the burst of publicity given by the soviet media 
to the earthquake 
the careers of gorbachev and ryzhkov have been linked ryzhkov 
was appointed to the communist party politburo in april 1985 a 
month after gorbachev took power he was assigned to head the soviet 
government in september 1985 and is considered an important player 
in gorbachevs economic reform plans 
but the earthquake and gorbachevs absence gave the 
59yearold ryzhkov an opportunity to shed a colorless image and 
gain daily television exposure 
thank you thank you thank you armenians called to ryzhkov 
in the earthquakedamaged city of kirovakan people are very 
satisfied said an elderly woman pressing ryzhkovs hands 
ryzhkov responded to people with smiles and promises of help 
hes gotten a high profile but whether it works to his 
advantage i dont know said one diplomat who spoke on condition 
of anonymity that will depend on how ryzhkovs work in armenia is 
perceived by other kremlin leaders he said 
ryzhkov acknowledged widespread reports of disorganization in the 
relief efforts during a news conference in the armenian capital 
yerevan on dec 12 but he said after a bad start the organization 
had begun to improve 
in the spirit of gorbachevs policy of glasnost or greater 
openness ryzhkov directly answered all the questions put to him by 
foreign and soviet reporters in yerevan 
he showed little emotion in his answers but when reporters asked 
him about ethnic troubles between armenians and azerbaijanis over 
control of the nagornokarabakh region he began jabbing the air 
with his hand and said we dont understand these people while 
the whole country is helping them they are raising these questions 
we think the armenian people must reject them 
it was the same issue that caused gorbachev to show his anger on 
soviet television asked about allegations by armenian activists 
that soviet officials planned to move orphaned armenians out of the 
earthquake area and repopulate it with russians he responded 
what kind of morals do those people have 
they dont need karabakh they are waging a battle for power 
and they must be stopped gorbachev said 
many armenians are upset with gorbachev for refusing to give in 
to their demands to annex nagornokarabakh from azerbaijan 
gorbachevs absence from public view was normal for the week 
after the quake but this week its a little more difficult to 
explain said the foreign diplomat 
but gorbachev has not missed any events that could be considered 
important enough to demand his presence and the kremlin has 
continued issuing documents over gorbachevs name 
the tass news agency said gorbachev sent a message of condolence 
to president reagan after the crash of a pan am jet in scotland on 
wednesday

a graffiti artists distinctive signature became 
his downfall when police matched the one he was writing on a 
manhattan building with one that appeared on nearly 80 subway cars 
authorities said 
transit police saw the teenager writing graffiti on the building 
and were able to charge him with defacing the subway cars because 
the graffiti signatures or tags matched said al oleary a 
transit police spokesman 
todd s james 19 was charged with seconddegree criminal 
mischief firstdegree criminal tampering both felonies and a 
misdemeanor thirddegree criminal trespass oleary said friday 
if convicted james faces four to seven years in prison on each 
felony count 
the officers saw james spraying the letters reas on the building 
oleary said last weekend 160 subway cars were spraypainted 
nearly half of them with the letters reas 
this can be in the future if the prosecution is successful a 
very valuable tool in the war against vandalism oleary said 
its the first time the district attorneys office was able to 
prosecute without seeing him being in the act of graffitiing the 
property 
a tag to a graffiti vandal is like a signature he said 
the way you sign your paycheck is the way a graffiti vandal writes 
his or her name on public property

plo leaders faced with growing dissension 
among radical factions met saturday to discuss forming a government 
for an independent palestinian state and map the next move in 
crucial talks with the united states 
most of the 15 members of the plos governing body attended the 
meeting at chief yasser arafats home outside baghdad palestine 
liberation organization officials said 
the meeting followed growing opposition by radical palestinian 
factions and some figures within the plo to arafats stated 
recognition of israel and renunciation of terrorism 
us officials insisted on such statements before they would deal 
with the plo 
azzam ahmed the plo representative in baghdad said the 
committee will discuss the dec 16 talks opened in tunisia with the 
united states and map out the future palestinian moves in the 
dialogue 
the talks were the first direct contact between the plo and 
washington in 13 years if sustained the talks could lead to a 
breakthrough in the tortuous quest to end the 40yearold 
arabisraeli conflict 
ahmed gave no details but stressed the committee will explore 
all the possible ways to advance the constructive dialogue 
the committee also is discussing efforts for international middle 
east peace conference and the formation of a provisional government 
for the independent palestinian state declared by the plos 
palestine national council last month 
plo officials said earlier that the provisional government might 
not actually be named during the committee meeting because further 
consultations may be needed 
sixtynine countries have recognized the stillsymbolic 
palestinian state while in baghdad arafat will lay the cornerstone 
of a palestinian embassy plo officials said 
ahmed said the committee also will review the yearlong 
palestinian uprising against israeli rule in the west bank and gaza 
and ways of escalating resistance to the occupation forces at 
least 334 palestinians and 14 israelis have died 
arafat arrived in baghdad late friday after flying from rome 
where he met earlier with pope paul ii and italian leaders 
ahmed indicated that the plo might call for an arab summit to 
press for an international peace conference under un auspices 
it is not clear how extensive opposition within the executive 
committee is to arafats moves 
one member mustafa zibri deputy leader of the marxist popular 
front for the liberation of palestine attacked arafats peace 
initiativeon monday zibri declared that arafats recognition of 
israel and renunciation of terrorism were only arafats personal 
opinion and are incompatible with resolutions passed by the 
palestine national council 
he warned we will continue to exercise our legitimate rights 
in struggling against the occupation by all means available 
including armed struggle 
palestinian dissidents based in syria warned tuesday they will 
continue the armed struggle against israel to torpedo his peace 
moves and will seek to oust him from plo leadership 
the americans have said they will break off the dialogue with the 
plo if the movement is found to have carried out terrorist attacks 
in lebanon newspapers reported saturday that the plo and the 
shiite moslem amal militia have reached a new peace pact to end 
their bloody 3year conflict the papers published the pact the 
sixth since 1985 and there was widespread doubt whether the accord 
would hold 
more than 3000 people have been killed and 10000 wounded since 
amal moved against palestinian refugee camps to prevent arafat from 
rebuilding a power base in lebanon israel destroyed palestinian 
outposts in a 1982 invasion 
newspapers said the new pact provides for a disengagement of 
forces and the removal of barricades to enforce a ceasefire between 
amal and the plo around sidon provincial capital of south lebanon 
amal has an estimated 10000 armed militiamen the plo has 4500 
guerrillas based in the sidon region 25 miles south of beirut

a giant oil storage vessel broke its 
mooring and drifted for 13 miles on saturday forcing a shutdown of 
more than 10 percent of britains north sea oil production coast 
guard and oil company officials said 
two tugboats sent to the scene about 200 miles east of the 
scottish port of dundee managed to attach lines to the tanker and 
brought the vessel under control after five hours said the coast 
guard rescue and coordination center in aberdeen 
the converted 200000ton tanker with 34 men on board was being 
towed by the tugs the oil chancellor and the oil challenger the 
coast guard said its destination was not immediately known 
the vessel is a tanker modified to act as a fixed engineless 
floating storage tank it has been permanently moored in shell uks 
fulmar oilfield collecting oil from three fields and then loading 
the crude on to smaller tankers 
shell uk said production from the three fields the fulmar and 
neighboring auk and clyde platforms had been shut down 
automatically when the vessel broke free 
the three fields have a combined daily production of 210000 
barrels of crude 10 to 12 percent of total output from the british 
sector of the north sea said a shell spokesman he spoke on 
condition of anonymity 
shell said production from the three fields would remain shut 
because they now had nowhere to send their oil crude oil from the 
three platforms normally flows by pipeline along the seabed and 
feeds into the vessel known as a floating storage unit 
when the vessel broke free at about 530 am in 15foot seas and 
60knot winds shell said it dragged its mooring installation with 
it 
shell said a sizable amount of oil had been spotted in the 
area but it was not known whether a serious leak had developed 
when the system shut down automatically at the seabed shell said 
there were 370 cubic yards of oil in the pipeline beyond the 
shutdown point 
initially there were fears the vessel would collide with other 
installations in the north sea with the vessel under tow 
helicopters called out from scotland and northern england to 
evacuate the men if necessary were recalled

for the first time in recent years 
blacks are buying toys sending christmas cards and filling their 
holiday shopping bags without fear that they will be punished for 
breaking a boycott 
but although some holiday traditions are making a comeback 
others died during the years of unrest and yuletide protest against 
apartheid 
there is no santa claus in soweto 
we are the biggest store in soweto but we do not have a father 
christmas here we believe that would be something out of place 
that is something that is confined to town where whites live 
said paul gama chief executive of the black chain supermarket 
gama said last year he didnt even offer christmas items for 
sale this year christmas cards and inexpensive balls and small 
plastic guns are selling briskly 
i think the people must be paying for the lost years in terms 
of enjoyment and excitement because this is the first normal 
christmas where there is no tension from any quarter gama said 
santa claus once was a part of sowetos holiday imagery but 
since nationwide antigovernment unrest broke out in 1984 there have 
been calls for a black christmas 
the calls consisted of boycotts against shopping for christmas 
presents and festive food christmas eve blackouts in the townships 
and memorial services for those detained under a state of emergency 
the township of 25 million blacks outside johannesburg was a 
focal point of the unrest 
people who worked in johannesburg and bought goods there during 
the christmas shopping period sometimes were attacked by youths when 
they disembarked from buses or trains 
sometimes boycottbreakers were beaten or killed in 1986 the 
call went out for a christmas eve blackout in soweto and monitors 
patrolled the township knocking on doors if they saw any more light 
than a candle 
there was no formal announcement that this year would be 
different and not even the outlawed african national congress has a 
definitive reason for the renewed holiday spirit 
it is possible that the popular democratic movement has found 
other ways and methods to register their feelings about apartheid 
without making a public call for a boycott said tom sebina a 
spokesman for the guerrilla organization in a statement from 
lusaka zambia 
people detained without charge have been a major focus of the 
black christmas protests since a national emergency was declared 
in june 1986 the release of hundreds of detainees over the past few 
months may have defused some of the motives for protest although 
hundreds almost all of them black still remain in custody without 
charge 
one of them journalist brian sokutu has been held without 
charge or trial for 30 months 
many soweto residents go home for christmas and home is usually 
a homestead in a rural area for many men and women the long 
holiday period is the only time of the year they see their children 
who are raised by grandmothers in tribal homelands because of lack 
of housing and school space in the urban townships 
in cape town meanwhile the family of jailed black leader nelson 
mandela arrived carrying presents and a cake for a christmas visit 
mandelas wife winnie their daughter zinzi and their three 
grandchildren planned an 80minute visit sunday with mandela at his

elizabeth hanford dole first and perhaps the 
only woman named to the bush cabinet has the resume of a topnotch 
ivy league lawyer and the charm of a quintessential southern belle 
her ability to disarm even the toughest critics has earned her 
widespread popularity on capital hill even among many democrats 
and her reputation as an able government official appears to have 
weathered harsh evaluations of her reagan administration tenure as 
transportation secretary 
she is a woman of great ability with many friends in both 
parties on capitol hill said sen edward m kennedy dmass 
chairman of the labor and human resources committee that must 
confirm her 
saturday she was named as labor secretary by presidentelect 
bush the choice left just one cabinet spot open that of energy 
secretary 
relentlessly cheerful mrs dole is at age 52 half of what inside 
washington likes to call a power couple her husband is senate 
republican leader robert dole who unsuccessfully sought his partys 
presidential nomination they have a watergate apartment and a 
miniature schnauzer named leader 
known as liddy a nickname she picked herself mrs dole was 
born in salisbury nc the only daughter of john van hanford a 
smalltown florist and mary ella hanford early on she displayed a 
promising combination of brains and beauty 
growing up she had ballet classes horseback riding lessons and 
at 18 a debutante ball in raleigh at 20 she was student body 
president of the womens college at duke university and also may 
queen she graduated phi beta kappa with a bachelors degree in 
history from duke in 1958 and went on to receive a masters degree 
in education and government from harvard university in 1960 
in 1962 she was named beauty queen at a boston naval base 
although she later recalled i was getting a little old for this 
sort of thing she graduated from harvard law school in 1965 
washington her mother said drew mrs dole like a magnet 
she immersed herself for 20 years in the process of climbing the 
political ladder in the process she switched from democrat to 
independent to republican 
she made her way through the old department of health education 
and welfare the federal trade commission and president nixons 
commission on consumer interests in 1976 she took a leave of 
absence from the ftc to campaign for her husbands vice presidential 
bid and in 1979 she quit the ftc two years before her term expired 
to help him run for president 
mrs dole is generally credited with softening her husbands 
hatchetman image although she dismisses that seeming to suggest 
he was always really a softy hes sort of the way i always knew 
him 
with no prior background in the transportation field mrs dole 
was named in 1983 as president reagans transportation secretary 
she pushed for mandatory seat belt laws tighter screening 
procedures in airports and more sophisticated anticollision devices 
for airliners 
but she was criticized in congress for spending more time on 
press releases than real improvements critics contended she more 
often than not unveiled new regulatory procedures after the 
department had been pushed into it by congress or the courts 
critics also faulted her for approving a string of airline mergers 
that concentrated much of the airline industry into a halfdozen 
large carriers 
in 1987 a trade journal called her dot stewardship little more 
than a planned media event and the washington monthly headlined a 
cover story charming her way to the white house air travel 
stinks auto safetys a joke and washington still loves liddy dole 
mrs dole stepped down a year ago to help her husbands 
presidential campaign saying the move had nothing to do with the 
criticism and declaring she was glad to join him on the campaign 
trail after years of living like passing ships in the night 
sen dole noted her new appointment with a combination of pride 
and humor it looks like tv dinners for me again but ill still 
probably vote for her confirmation he said

nicaraguan refugees are arriving in south florida at 
a pace reminiscent of the mariel sealift in 1980 when 125000 
cubans hit the shores over a fivemonth period 
the scene in 1980 some 700 mariel cubans were temporarily housed 
at the orange bowl before being moved to a tent city underneath 
an interstate 95 overpass at one point as many as 1200 cubans 
crowded into 40 tents 
now bobby maduro miami stadium the spring home of the baltimore 
orioles has become the winter home of nicaraguans who fled their 
wartorn central american nation in hopes of a better life 
late this week 275 nicaraguans were housed at the stadium with 
more arriving daily many coming across from mexico and traveling 
east 
conny duarte secretary of the committee of poor nicaraguans in 
exile which is helping city workers run the shelter estimated that 
number could nearly double by the end of the month 
we are strapped to the max said bobby bernal administrative 
assistant to dade countys manager and refugee coordinator 
immigration is a federal responsibility but we cant turn our 
backs 
about 70 percent of the 200 asylum applications received daily at 
the miami office of the immigration and naturalization service are 
from nicaraguans said ins district director perry rivkind some 
35000 to 40000 nicaraguans have applied here for asylum over the 
past year he said 
the flood can be attributed to the collapse of the economy as 
well as the foundering rebel movement against the sandinistas 
while the total has been spread out over a longer period the 
impact of the refugees has been compared to the exodus of cubans 
from the port of mariel in the 1980 freedom flotilla 
its going to come to a point when well look at the federal 
government and say when is it going to end when can we see a 
slowdown in this problem bernal said if the government 
doesnt wish to curtail this then provide us with some dollars 
prompted by a backlog of asylum applications in miami los 
angeles and harlingen texas ins plans to beef up review teams to 
process petitions and it has been announced that nicaraguans will 
no longer automatically receive authorization to work while their 
cases are pending 
but the refugees at the stadium were lucky they are expected to 
receive work permits within days following a meeting between miami 
city manager cesar odio and ins commissioner alan nelson in 
washington 
working papers theres little else the refugees talk about in 
the bowels of the stadium where they were moved recently from a 
threeroom storefront in little havana 
we have everything here food and clothes but we want to 
have a home and be able to work said ana maria zepeda who is 
seven months pregnant and came with her husband and three children 
ages 2 to 5 we all say it would be the best christmas if we could 
get work permits 
the women and children are separated from the men who sleep on 
the second floor in a space beneath the stadiums bleachers the 
women are in a firstfloor showerlocker room area that is lined 
walltowall with cots and metal bunk beds piled high with blankets 
and clothes the children play down the center aisle with donated 
toys a fake undecorated christmas tree and a television are on a 
corner table 
donated food and clothing also has been evenly split with a 
varying number of miamis homeless population who are staying in 
another part of the stadium 
but while the goods have poured in and volunteers are abundant 
housing for the refugees remains a critical issue already the 
refugee population has outgrown an empty cityowned building being 
renovated as a shelter the stadium must be emptied by midjanuary 
and the new shelter can only accommodate 150 people ms garcia said 
other alternatives being discussed include setting up a trailer 
park on three acres of stateowned land in west dade 
despite the problems mayor xavier suarez says he hasnt become 
overly worried about the citys ability to absorb the latest wave of 
refugees 
were obviously rolling with the punches here he said 
this is a pretty resilient community

schools spent an extra 3555 for each of the 
44 million handicapped children receiving some form of special 
education in the 198586 academic year according to a study 
prepared for the government 
the total cost for special education students was 6335 on 
average or 23 times the 2780 cost for regular classwork the 
report said about 11 percent of the nations school children 
receive special education in some way 
the new 18 million study done by a private research and 
analysis firm decision resources corp breaks down the special 
education costs by the different approaches used to teach children 
with handicaps ranging from physical disabilities to mental 
disorders 
it examined both resource programs or those serving pupils 
for less than half of the regular 30hour school week and 
selfcontained programs defined as those which occupied more 
than 15 hours per week 
looking only at what was spent on special education the resource 
programs spent 2463 per pupil versus 5566 per pupil in the 
selfcontained programs 
but the schools also incurred regular education costs for these 
pupils the full regular cost of 2780 for those in resource 
programs and about half as much 1347 for those in 
selfcontained programs 
that boosted the total per pupil costs to 5243 for those in 
resource programs and to 6913 for those in selfcontained 
programs the study said 
its an erroneous comparison to say if i had all the kids in 
resource programs i could save a lot of money said mary moore 
vice president of decision resources corp and project director for 
the study the difference is only about 1700 not 3000 
the study based on visits to 60 school districts in 18 states 
also found average per pupil costs of 
4750 for preschool special education programs plus 973 in 
regular education costs for a total of 5723 
29108 for residential programs plus 389 in regular education 
costs for a total of 29497 
most special education pupils were enrolled in resource programs 
and they spent 80 percent of their time in regular education 
fifteen percent of those in selfcontained programs spent no time 
in regular education the rest spent an average of 28 percent of 
their time in regular classes 
the study said special education costs rose 10 percent after 
inflation between 197778 and 198586 versus a 4 percent increase 
for regular education 
instruction accounted for 63 percent of the special education 
costs assessment 13 percent support services 11 percent related 
services 10 percent and transportation 5 percent moore said the 
percentages added to more than 100 percent because of rounding up 
the average caseload for teachers in resource programs was 26 
students 
in selfcontained programs there was one teacher for every four 
hardofhearing students one per five autistic or multihandicapped 
students one per seven deaf or visually handicapped students one 
per eight mentally retarded or orthopedically impaired students one 
per nine speech impaired or seriously emotionally disturbed 
students and one per 13 learning disabled students 
transportation was the most expensive related service provided 
handicapped students thirty percent needed special transportation 
services at an average cost of 1583 assessment cost an average 
of 1206 physical therapy 993 occupational therapy 918 
psychological services 867 speech language pathology 648 and 
guidance and counseling 553 
federal dollars provided 5 percent of the local districts 
instructional budget for the handicapped but 17 percent of their 
budget for support services 
moore discussed the report in an interview and provided a set of 
tables prepared for a recent briefing for special education groups 
the full report patterns in special education service delivery 
and cost will be available early next year

the women at the birthday party enjoyed 
watching a male stripper shuck his fake sheriffs deputy outfit but 
police gave him a different reception on his way home 
charles bateham 27 was charged with impersonating a police 
officer the charges were later dropped but bateham suffered a 
separated shoulder in a motorcycle accident prior to his arrest 
the stripper started off his act oct 16 wearing a fake sheriffs 
deputy uniform with sarasota sheriffs office patches on the 
arms a mailorder county mounty badge and a gun belt 
after performing at the birthday party bateham said he put a 
jacket over his uniform and was driving toward his girlfriends 
house when a police car started following him he had an accident on 
a dead end road 
when the officers walked up to me i told them i was a dancer 
and it was a bb gun one reached over and threw the gun on the 
ground and the rest is history 
when he arrived in court thursday to stand trial he learned the 
misdemeanor charge was being dropped 
defense attorney ty trayner said a person cannot be convicted of 
impersonating a police officer just because he is dressed for the 
part he has to try something official like threaten to arrest 
somebody 
so bateham is free to continue using the uniform with male 
express 
the deputy uniform is our most popular outfit he said 
ill just take more precautions from now on i wont wear the 
shirt or gun belt when im traveling

soviet holiday customs look a lot like american 
ones but in moscow the jolly man with the fluffy white beard and 
red suit rides in a taxi and few of the presents he brings run on 
batteries 
instead of standing in line at a shopping mall to sit on santas 
lap many soviet children get house calls from ded moroz 
grandfather frost and snegurochka a beautiful snow maiden dressed 
in white 
fiveyearold olgas eyes lit up as ded moroz and snegurochka 
walked into her familys apartment saturday morning 
the couple sang danced and told riddles with the little girl 
ded moroz then opened his sack and pulled out a huge teddy bear 
which olgas father had handed him secretly beforehand 
its so beautiful said olga who was dressed in a 
powderblue princess costume and wore a shiny tiara and a big light 
blue bow atop her head 
ded moroz and snegurochka wished the family happy new year and 
trudged through the mounds of snow back to their hired yellow taxi 
they had about 30 more stops before the day was through 
i dont feel like its new years unless i dress up like this 
and visit little children said vladimir krylov 37 who has been 
playing ded moroz for nine years 
our soviet children believe so much that ded moroz and 
snegurochka are real said lyuda golubgikova 33 a sixyear 
veteran snegurochka i love to see their eyes shine when we walk 
in 
after the bolshevik revolution in 1917 the primary winter 
holiday in the soviet union switched from christmas celebrated jan 
7 in the russian orthodox faith to new years 
olgas parents were among about 4000 people who each paid a 
moscow business called consumer services about 9 to have the 
holiday couple bring new years greetings to their children between 
dec 24 and jan 5 said tamara korovina who hired the cast of 
characters 
people signed up for ded moroz house calls at detsky mir the 
largest childrens store in the soviet union located in the center 
of moscow 
soviets flock to detsky mir from across the nation and buy about 
500000 toys per day during the holiday season said garnik 
oganesyan director of commerce at the fivestory store 
valentina rubin 31 went to detsky mir to pick up a toy for her 
3yearold son but while shopping decided to order a visit from ded 
moroz 
andrusha will be so surprised he has only seen ded moroz on 
greeting cards she said 
mrs rubin said she had no trouble finding the toy submarine her 
son had requested all she had to do was fight the crowd at detsky 
mir which makes christmas eve at a new york department store look 
calm in comparison and wait in line for 30 minutes 
parents whose children asked for electronic or batteryoperated 
toys were likely to be disappointed detsky mir only had a few such 
toys and as soon as they went on display they were snapped up 
admitted oganesyan 
my 11yearold son wants an electronic game but i dont think 
ill be able to find it said a detsky mir employee who asked 
that her name not be used 
she said soviet children usually receive just one toy because 
for each gift a parent must run run run to find it and then wait 
wait wait to buy it

prime minister noboru takeshita won a major victory 
saturday when parliaments upper house voted his controversial tax 
reform package into law paving the way for the first overhaul of 
japans postwar tax system 
takeshitas liberal democratic party used its commanding 
parliamentary majority to pass the package which introduces a 3 
percent sales tax and cuts corporate and upperlevel income taxes 
strong public and political opposition stopped several previous 
tax reform attempts in the past 10 years 
takeshita who had set tax reform as his top priority bowed 
deeply to the chamber after its approval and moved quickly to allay 
fears 
i am well aware that there are fears and anxieties among 
the people about the new tax system he said the reform has 
laid the foundation for a prosperous aging society and for 
sustaining the vitality of japans economy and society 
takeshita vowed not to increase the sales tax above 3 percent 
through the remainder of his term which ends next fall opposition 
parties had raised concerns that the government would raise the rate 
to increase revenues 
takako doi who leads japans largest opposition group called 
the legislation defective and said her japan socialist party 
would continue to demand the resignations of the takeshita cabinet 
and the dissolution of parliament 
the laws extend injustice and unfairness by forcing large 
sacrifices in peoples daily lives through heavy tax burdens doi 
told a news conference 
they cut taxes for corporations and higher wageearners but the 
tax burden of lowerincome families is expected to increase 
the measures constitute the first major overhaul of the tax 
system drafted by us occupation authorities after japans world 
war ii defeat 
passage of the bills followed five months of deliberations that 
were interrupted by frequent opposition boycotts after disclosures 
that top politicians including aides to prime minister takeshita 
and former finance minister kiichi miyazawa had profited from 
questionable stock dealings 
within minutes of the vote takeshita appointed a new finance 
minister tatsuo murayama one of the architects of the tax reform 
takeshita had been acting finance minister since dec 9 when 
miyazawa resigned after being linked to the scandal 
approval ratings for the takeshita administration plummeted over 
its handling of the stock scandal and tax package 
the drop in support reflected the heavy importance the japanese 
attach to political consensus 
if takeshita is a poor prime minister or too straightforward 
or not skilled at consensusmaking of course the bills would not 
pass said seizaburo sato a political science professor at tokyo 
university 
but the more important thing is that it took 10 years and 
there was a growing consciousness emerging of the necessity of the 
sales tax sato said 
also saturday takeshita said he would postpone until spring a 
planned january trip to washington to meet with presidentelect 
george bush reports cited emperor hirohitos precarious health and 
implementation of the tax plan as reasons for the delay

president reagan urged americans today to 
remember those both in their own country and in earthquakestricken 
armenia whose holidays are diminished by tragedy 
we know that there are those among us for whom the holidays are 
painful and lonely reagan said in his weekly radio broadcast 
which was taped thursday and broadcast as the president vacationed 
at his new home here 
i know you join with me in hoping that this year they will take 
heart and have faith he said 
now here in our country there are children without homes 
suffering from dire diseases whose christmases will be makeshift at 
best the president said 
as he often has he paid tribute to organizations such as toys 
for tots which provide gifts and other help for such children 
i know all americans have joined with me in grieving for those 
who perished in the armenian earthquake reagan said 
here too the president praised the volunteer relief efforts 
from america and other countries including israel and lebanon 
which have poured into armenia 
athough the tape was made after wednesdays crash of a pan 
american jumbo jet in scotland the president made no mention of it 
he did make a statement of condolence about the crash as he left the 
white house on friday 
later in the day he said that after nearly eight years of living 
upstairs in the white house hes awed by the 6500squarefoot home 
he and his wife nancy will live in after his term ends jan 20 
reagan got his second look at the house friday when he and the 
first lady arrived here to begin a twoweek california vacation 
i am awed and i love it assistant white house press 
secretary mark weinberg quoted the president as saying after the 
first lady took him on a tour of the secluded home in the ritzy bel 
air section of town 
mrs reagan had confided to reporters earlier that she sneaked 
the president out of his hotel without reporters being told during 
one of their earlier visits to los angeles so reagan could get a 
peek at the house 
she had him crouch down in a white house car so he couldnt be 
seen she said 
the house stands on 1 acres of ground with a swimming pool a 
group of 20 california friends of the reagans bought it in 1986 with 
them in mind the reagans are leasing the house from the group 
called wall management 
before reagan became president he and his family lived in 
pacific palisades in the western part of los angeles in a house 
that has since been sold 
they have a spanish style adobe house of five rooms and 1500 
square feet at their ranch in the santa ynez mountains about 30 
miles north of santa barbara reagan has said they plan to make 
occasional visits to the ranch during his retirement just as they 
did while in the white house 
the president and first lady were expected to go out to dinner 
saturday night with charles z wick the director of the us 
information agency and his wife this is a christmas eve custom 
with them but in recent years the dinner has been in washington

opposition leader kim daejung on 
saturday urged president roh taewoo to accept a north korean call 
for political and military talks on easing tension on the divided 
korean peninsula 
kim who heads south koreas largest opposition party told 
reporters that positive overtures were needed from south korea to 
end the military confrontation and expedite reunification with north 
korea 
the leader of the party for peace and democracy said substantial 
progress could be made next year in talks with north korea because 
changing circumstances on the peninsula were forcing the north to 
open its doors 
north korea has called for highlevel political and military 
discussions between the two koreas that could clear the way for 
summit talks on reuniting the peninsula 
in addition north korea last week called for threeway talks 
among north and south korea and the united states to negotiate 
durable peace measures 
on saturday members of south koreas cabinet agreed to consider 
the norths proposal for the political and military talks 
government officials who requested anonymity said south korea would 
seek a dialogue with the north at the level of prime minister 
the hankook ilbo a leading seoul newspaper said contacts are 
continuing through various channels to help realize rohs desire to 
hold a summit with his north korean counterpart kim il sung 
both koreas in recent months have made proposals for improving 
relations but little progress has been made south korean officials 
have said they believe the norths recent proposals were aimed 
mainly at removing us troops from the south 
north korea contends the presence of 42000 us troops in the 
south is preventing reunification of the peninsula which was 
divided in 1945 when us and soviet troops ended japans colonial 
rule at the end of world war ii 
however lawmakers from both sides are to resume talks on dec 29 
on a possible nonaggression agreement and other peace measures 
meanwhile soviet foreign minister eduard shevardnadze left north 
korea saturday after a threeday visit during which he pledged his 
country would not establish diplomatic relations with south korea 
an official report said 
the two countries stressed in a joint communique that a reduction 
of tensions between rival koreas was of enormous importance in 
guaranteeing peace in the asiapacific region the official korean 
central news agency said 
the soviet union expressed its support for north korean proposals 
for political and military talks between north and south korea and 
for peace talks involving the two koreas and the united states said 
the agency dispatch monitored in tokyo 
the soviet side also reaffirmed its opposition to recognizing 
both koreas as a means of reducing tension it pledged it would not 
establish diplomatic relations with south korea despite its 
participation in the seoul olympic games and its increasing trade 
ties with the south 
the united states and japan have called on china and the soviet 
union north koreas allies to recognize south korea in exchange 
for their establishing relations with the north but north korea has 
said such moves will lead to the permanent division of the peninsula

roy smoot is a shopping mall santa claus but 
he never says ho ho ho he never flirts and he knows what to 
do if a frightened child wets on him 
smoot is a graduate of the university of santa claus a 
nationwide howto course sponsored by los angelesbased western 
temporary services to train a select few on the finer points of 
playing the jolly old elf 
i never pictured myself as a santa claus says smoot who 
calls himself a cowboy a horseshoer by trade it was really 
overwhelming at first 
this is smoots first experience as santa his towering 6foot4 
nearly 300pound frame helps him play the part but hes more than 
just another pretty santa 
smoot 42 finished his training several weeks ago after being 
recruited by western to serve as one of the companys santas 
we approached him hes got that look about him that sparkle 
in his eye said darla lowell manager of westerns tulsa office 
westerns course is based on the concept that theres more to 
being santa than wearing a red suit and laughing a loud ho ho 
ho 
you can put the facade on but it doesnt work said jenny 
zink national director of marketing for western in the companys 
los angeles office 
western trained more than 3300 santas this year to appear at 
shopping malls and department stores even restaurants and bank 
lobbies across the country 
theres really no university but graduates of the course do 
receive a diploma from westerns university of santa claus 
the company has more than 325 offices that specialize in finding 
temporary employees for clerical technical legal and accounting 
services it takes its santa business seriously 
this is a very important job said ms zink who heads 
westerns santa division we probably wouldnt spend half a day 
training a laborer to pick up a piano 
santas trained by western must pass the companys course which 
teaches them how to be authentic santas ms lowell said 
theres a 40minute introduction video instructions on what to 
say to children suggested dialogue lessons on how to dress like 
santa and a requirement that each santa know the names of all the 
reindeers the course ends with a written test that prospective 
santas must pass to graduate 
only one in 23 applicants is selected for santa ms lowell 
said we interview a lot of people check references and verify 
they are people of high character and morals 
western which has provided santas nationwide for 21 years 
advises its santas to follow the guidelines it provides when dealing 
with children we frown upon any type of originality because it 
has been proven that this brings disaster reads the companys 
manual for the santa technique 
santas should address children as young fellow or young 
lady refer to parents as folks because many children are 
adopted never flirt santa is married ask children what toys they 
want for christmas so they wont ask for intangible items such as 
the reuniting of divorced parents never make quick jerky movements 
with small children who might be frightened by something unexpected 
and if a child wets calmly lift the child and cheerfully hand them 
back to the parent 
perhaps the most interesting instruction involves what most 
people identify with santa we omit the ho ho ho because it 
may frighten the children the western training manual states 
talk softly

a serious and substantial morale problem 
afflicts the nations 53500 roman catholic priests many of whom 
are overworked lonely and sexually troubled says a groundbreaking 
report by a panel of us bishops 
discussing openly problems that once were kept quiet the 
bishops committee on priestly life and ministry said some priests 
are just going through the motions and many have settled for a 
parttime presence to their priesthood 
part of the priests morale problem said the committee of the 
national conference of catholic bishops comes from the feeling that 
they are caught between vatican directives and a catholic laity that 
is often at odds with rome 
pope john paul ii has urged priests to accept suffering as part 
of their fate but the american bishops have said that is not 
helpful and have compiled suggestions on how to improve priests 
morale 
the panel report obtained friday by the associated press said 
there are many creative and energetic priests but it is also 
clear to us that there exists today a serious and substantial morale 
problem among priests in general 
the report was hailed by catholic clerics as the first official 
recognition of the situations gravity 
i think its very encouraging that the bishops are helping the 
priests name the pain said the rev frank j mcnulty who 
represented us priests before the pope last year in miami 
theyre putting in this document what weve said ourselves over a 
cup of coffee and thats a great help when youre trying to solve a 
problem 
bishop john mcraith of the owensboro ky diocese led the 
subcommittee that drafted the report it was written for the 
nations 300 bishops only but church leaders decided in november to 
distribute it to priests 
there really has been no scientific analysis done of the morale 
of priests mcraith said saturday i think our point was that 
the morale of priests always needs attention 
the shortage of priests is both a cause and a result of the 
morale problem according to the report a recent study by the 
hartford seminarys center for social and religious research said 
the number of catholic seminarians declined from 8885 in 1965 to 
4063 in 1985 and estimated that the number of priests will decline 
40 percent by the year 2000 about 15 percent of priests have left 
the priesthood since 1970 said dean r hoge a sociologist at 
catholic university of america 
am i in a dying profession is the question that is starting 
to demoralize many priests said sociologist martin marty of the 
university of chicago theres that sense did i bet on the wrong 
thing 
mandatory celibacy is a major reason for clergy leaving the 
priesthood and for loneliness among those who stay the bishops 
said the church has not helped priests deal with their sexual 
feelings as it should they said 
they recommended that a priests sexuality be recognized as an 
essential component of human existence and that better methods 
including encouraging close friendships with men and women be found 
to help priests lead a celibate life 
theres just no support for that kind of life now mcraith 
said they are surrounded by a culture that is incredibly 
promiscuous 
with rectories that used to be filled with half a dozen or so 
priests often housing just one today the problem of loneliness is 
exacerbated loneliness is often mentioned by priests as cause for 
anxiety and pain the report said 
another result of the shortage is that where priests could once 
look forward to a graceful retirement now they face heavier 
workloads long and painful battles over consolidation and closure 
of parishes and less probability of retirement at all 
the dwindling number of priests is ministering to a larger flock 
the us catholic population rose from 48 million in 1970 to 535 
million in 1988 
in reaction the bishops said many priests have chosen to drop 
out quietly this is particularly true of those in the 45 to 60 age 
group who are willing to go through the necessary minimum of motions 
but whose hearts and energies are elsewhere 
in his speech to us priests last fall the pope told them to 
bear their hardship with faith the spirit god has given us is no 
cowardly spirit he said 
but the bishops committee is saying you have to do more than 
tough it out there are things that might be done mcnulty said 
the vaticans closing off discussion on issues such as celibacy 
and the ordination of women results in priests being caught in the 
middle the panel said 
some priests feel that at times they are passing on to 
parishioners who clearly disagree pastoral decisions which they 
sense their bishops do not fully endorse and which they themselves 
personally question it said 
the committee recommended giving priests greater authority in 
making decisions that affect their lives including participation in 
the selection of bishops 
but mcraith minimized the differences between us priests and 
the vatican 
there are some things that are not resolvable and that 
celibacy may be one he said so they priests have to be 
careful how they ask those questions

time magazine has named the endangered earth 
its planet of the year departing from its annual man of the year 
designation to call for a universal crusade to save the planet 
this year the earth spoke like god warning noah of the 
deluge the weekly newsmagazine said citing natural and 
humancaused disasters from earthquakes to overpopulation to 
pollution of the worlds beaches 
since 1927 time annually has selected the person group or 
object that in its editors views most significantly influenced 
world events that year it selected an inanimate object once before 
the computer in 1982 
in the cover article of its jan 2 issue released saturday time 
warned of a series of impending environmental catastrophes 
pollutioncaused warming of the atmosphere known as the 
greenhouse effect threatening weather changes that could flood 
coastlines and render large areas of the planet infertile and 
uninhabitable 
toxic and radioactive wastes and dumped garbage that could 
poison drinking water and despoil the land 
chemical pollution that is depleting the atmospheres protective 
ozone layer 
clearing of tropical rain forests driving thousands of species 
to extinction 
most of these evils had been going on for a long time and some 
of the worst disasters apparently had nothing to do with human 
behavior time said yet this years bout of freakish weather 
and environmental horror stories seemed to act as a powerful 
catalyst for worldwide public opinion 
everyone suddenly sensed that this gyrating globe this 
precious repository of all the life we know of was in danger no 
single individual no event no movement captured imaginations or 
dominated headlines more than the clump of rock and soil and water 
and air that is our common home 
added time now more than ever the world needs leaders who 
can inspire their fellow citizens with a fiery sense of mission not 
a nationalistic or military campaign but a universal crusade to save 
the planet

to the wails of her mother svetlana 
arikilyan was laid to rest in this devastated city on saturday after 
grave diggers cut a hole in the black frozen earth with a jackhammer 
oh my darling girl farewell farewell a weeping varsik 
arikilyan exclaimed as pallbearers holding two worn ropes lowered 
her 36yearold daughters wooden coffin draped in a royal blue 
cloth into the ground 
she cast a handful of dirt on the coffin then turned away in 
agony 
for us armenians there can be no holidays this year no new 
years no christmas said edik kasparyan a leninakan teacher 
there has been too much loss too much death 
armenias secondlargest city 11 miles east of the turkish 
border is still reeling from the dec 7 earthquake that soviet 
officials estimate killed 55000 people 
as soviets elsewhere prepare for the new years holiday and its 
rituals of giftgiving and family gettogethers armenians still are 
counting their dead and digging out from the ruins of the deadliest 
earthquake in their nations history 
survivors come in gratitude to kiss the stone walls of 
leninakans armenian catholic church of the seven wounds whose bell 
tower toppled to the ground but whose sanctuary was spared by the 
great quake 
for the survivors there is also sorrow pain hunger and anger 
day and night when the temperature drops near zero the grisly 
search for the dead goes on 
shortly after dawn rescuers combing the wreckage of a ninestory 
apartment building gently freed the body of 29yearold dina 
mikhailovna by her side was the body of her child who could have 
been no more than 1 years old a smashed baby stroller and a 
plastic fir tree that the family had bought for the holidays 
mother and child were placed in a coffin made from particle board 
and painted black six men struggled to carry it down a snowfrosted 
mountain of smashed concrete and twisted pipes to a truck 
armenians an ancient people who embraced christianty as a state 
religion more than 1600 years ago have canceled christmas 
festivities on jan 6 the date they and the other eastern rites 
usually celebrate the birth of jesus christ 
martin pashayan 42 an armenian who teaches french was counting 
on receiving a new threeroom apartment for his family in time for 
the new year instead his wife knarik 42 and his daughter and son 
died when their eighthfloor apartment crashed down around them 
for the first week i was out of my mind with grief said the 
haggard sunkeneyed pashayan but then i realized that if i had 
been left alive it was to live i asked why me when i look 
around i see that everyone here suffered every family 
once home to more than 280000 people leninakan today has only 
100000 inhabitants thousands of whom now live in tents many 
residents have been evacuated 
tens of thousands of homes schools for 63000 students 
nurseries for 15000 children and hospitals with nearly 5000 beds 
will have to be built or repaired in the disaster area in two years 
tass said its report came from a meeting in moscow saturday of the 
council of ministers or cabinet 
speakers at the meeting said government agencies had taken a 
businesslike and efficient approach in the search and rescue 
but in yerevan the armenian capital a commission of the ruling 
politburo said the relief effort was not going smoothly according 
to tass 
in leninakan hundreds of people maintain a vigil by bonfires 
that burn around the clock near about 200 wrecked and toppled 
buildings waiting until bodies of their loved ones are borne from 
the smashed concrete and dust 
i lost my whole family my daughter my son now i have no one 
to live with said 70yearold avetik alexanyan he then began to 
cry 
trucks bring bread and lumps of hot boiled meat to leninakans 
central square to feed the homeless but some families receive only 
parcels of cold food 
near the citys medical clinic closed because of earthquake 
damage people lined up at 6 am to receive donated clothes from 
abroad eight hours later scores of people were still waiting 
a group of 50 west german relief workers gathered saturday night 
for hot spiced wine from jerry cans and christmas eve dinner a tape 
recorder played christmas carols including the first noel but

as president reagan basks in the warmth of a 
california christmas the homeless people he said prefer to live on 
the streets gather around their flameless urban campfires in the wet 
chill of the capital 
a sparsely decorated pine tree stands propped against a street 
lamp as a group of sturdy young men stamp their feet on a street 
grate above the citys underground network of heat and steam pipes 
these men are four blocks from the white house where this week 
reagan spoke of the homeless during a television interview with 
abcs david brinkley 
those people still prefer being out there on the grates or 
the lawn to going into one of those shelters the president said 
in the interview broadcast thursday 
the american civil liberties union called reagans remarks mean 
spirited and insensitive saying the number of homeless has 
increased dramatically during his administration estimates range in 
the hundreds of thousands with more than 15000 in the nations 
capital 
but some of the grate people say reagan was correct in a 
sense about their preferences 
given the choice of one of the grates and the urine and the 
lice and the maggots in shelters ill take the grates said 
robert jackson as a stiff hot updraft warmed a small circle of men 
in their 20s and 30s 
others said the shelters were full anyway theyd been turned 
away 
none of them much liked what reagan said about street people 
especially his suggestion that most are mentally retarded the 
president spoke of the release of mental patients from hospitals in 
the face of civil liberties demands 
they wanted freedom but they walked out to where there was 
nothing for them and they are a large percentage of that group that 
you see out there reagan said 
again some of the street people think reagan was partially 
correct 
it was all done with good intentions when they started 
releasing people who were not a danger to others said robert 
moens 29 who is clean welldressed articulate and living over 
the grates across the street from the state department but its 
more inhuman to let them stay out here and fend for themselves some 
of them are psychotic and should be locked up 
moens said the young men in his group are on the streets to avoid 
the drug addicts serious drunks transvestites criminals and 
psychotics who they say infest some of the shelters in the city 
the sheriff go go joe and the others who live over the grates 
make an odd family 
a few said they have jobs but cant save enough to pay the 
minimum 65 a week for flophouse rent 
reagan told brinkley there are lots of jobs in washington 
how could they be out there when every week youll find 
from 60 to 75 full pages of helpwanted ads in the washington 
paper the president asked 
go go joe who prides himself on good personal hygiene and 
professes a deep christian faith said he has had several 
335anhour minimumwage jobs 
i challenge president reagan to live on that he said 
the sheriff who would not give his real name showed his photo 
on a plastic defense department identification card and said he was 
working at the pentagon and comes home to his park benches at night 
he showed a recent color photo of his 11yearold daughter he 
said he sends her money every time he gets paid 
i dont want pity he said im just in washington trying 
to get a foothold this is our living room and thats our television 
set he pointed at a partially demolished building a classy 
apartment house a drug store and riverside liquors 
liquor store coowner brian fischer has a different view of the 
grates 
some of the men are his friends one once brought him to tears a 
fellow named allen who came in so cold he couldnt fasten his jacket 
when he asked me to help him zip up i got an image of my 
7yearold kid and i cried said fischer 
he agreed that some have serious mental problems when one of the 
grate people lay down in the middle of e street and started shooting 
at the sky with his fingers fischer said he telephoned for the 
police and an ambulance then because it was lunchtime he ordered 
a pizza 
the pizza arrived first and the authorities a couple of hours 
later he said 
and when an elderly whitebearded derelict called wolfman died a 
few weeks ago after living on the streets for more than two decades 
he lay on a grate for three hours before anyone came to take away 
the body fischer said 
the president has a very valid point about them preferring to 
live on the grates rather than in the washington shelters said 
fischer but criminals in prison are treated better than these 
people 
another view of the homeless was offered saturday by house 
majority whip tony coelho dcalif in the democratic partys 
weekly radio broadcast 
the reality is coelho said most of them are not much 
different from you or me they are the elderly the veterans the 
physically disabled and the chronically ill they are the drug and 
alcohol dependent theyre the migrant farm workers but in ever 
increasing numbers americas homeless are working families with 
kids 
coelho said that while ronald reagan never understood this 
issue of homelessness democrats were convinced his successor 
george bush will make a serious effort to deal with the tragedy 
of homelessness

presidentelect bush on saturday named 
elizabeth h dole as his secretary of labor saying she has the 
experience the stature and the ability to cope with the 
challenges of americas changing work force 
mrs dole 52 former transportation secretary and the wife of 
bushs bitter campaign rival senate minority leader bob dole 
rkan is the first woman named to a full cabinet post in the new 
administration though carla hills as the us trade 
representative will have cabinet rank 
bush said a dramatic change has occurred as women enter the 
work force in increasing numbers and in this environment it is 
essential that we have a secretary of labor who understands the 
challenges out there and who has the experience the stature and 
the ability to deal with them effectively 
other issues confronting the labor secretary are retraining 
displaced workers ensuring better job safety creating 
privatepublic partnerships and respecting workers rights the vice 
president said 
bushs announcement made the day before christmas means that 
only once cabinet job energy secretary remains open bush said 
he would reveal no more appointments before next friday following 
his return from a hunting and fishing trip in texas and alabama 
mrs dole standing next to bush outside the vice presidents 
mansion said unemployment was at a 14year low but people were 
still unable to find work 
to promote and protect the welfare of americas working men and 
women americas working families is a challenge i accept with 
great enthusiasm she said mrs dole said she would give a high 
priority to issues such as child care and the homeless 
bushs selection drew praise from labor leaders as well as from 
key members of the senate which will have to confirm mrs doles 
nomination to succeed ann dore mclaughlin 
presidentelect bush saved one of his best appointments until 
near the end said sen edward kennedy dmass chairman of the 
senate labor and human resources committee she is a woman of 
great ability with many friends in both parties on capitol hill 
sen orrin hatch rutah the ranking republican on the 
committee said mrs dole brings to the job a proven track 
record at the transportation department she pushed for safety 
issues including requirements for passive restraints in automobiles 
it looks like tv dinners for me again but ill still probably 
vote for her confirmation sen dole joked dole said his wife 
whom he and others call liddy will give 110 percent to make a 
difference for america 
bush said the fact that mrs dole is married to the minority 
leader played no role in his decision this appointment stands on 
its merits he said he joked that he would love to see some side 
benefits of the appointment adding bob and i are on good 
footing 
a north carolina native and a harvardtrained lawyer mrs dole 
left her post as transportation secretary to work on her husbands 
unsuccessful 1988 presidential campaign after bush seized the gop 
nomination she traveled around the country speaking on his behalf 
often to evangelical groups 
mrs dole has long been rumored for a spot in the bush 
administration and was on bushs short list of vice presidential 
running mates she was known to have wanted the position of un 
ambassador a job bush gave to career diplomat thomas pickering 
before moving to transportation mrs dole was a highranking 
white house staffer serving as a liaison between president reagan 
and special interest groups she had contacts then with organized 
labor before reagans election in 1980 mrs dole was a member of 
the federal trade commission 
said aflcio president lane kirkland we look forward to 
working with her she is a person of proven stature and wide 
experience in public life who will give the labor department an 
important voice in the affairs of interest to working americans 
on specific labor issues bush said he still favors raising the 
minimum wage but he did not know when he might ask congress to take 
that step he was also noncommital on broadening job protection for 
parents who want to take leaves when children are born or fall ill 
mrs dole like many of bushs cabinet members is a washington 
veteran prompting questions about bushs stated commitment to bring 
fresh faces to the nations capital 
bush dismissed the idea that his cabinet does not have enough new 
blood the fact that somebody has had experience should not rule 
her face or his face into an old face category he said 
besides the post of energy secretary bush said he still is 
looking for someone to fill the new post of drug czar william raab 
head of the us customs service is known to be interested in that 
slot 
recent speculation for the energy job centered on peter johnson 
a former administrator of the bonneville power administration

magical qualities of snow 
you can pretend that you are trudging through the arctic with

or you can travel to an enchanted land or become an olympic figure 
skater swishing around on the glittering ice

her home was gutted by a fire blamed on a 
short in christmas tree lights but diana bojorquez said the holiday 
has been salvaged by the generosity of others 
even as the fire burned thursday morning people began offering 
help ms bojorquez said friday

the house of commons on saturday approved the 
canadaus free trade agreement as opposition lawmakers sang the 
countrys national anthem to protest what they said was a sellout of 
canadas sovereignty 
the sweeping legislation will begin breaking down trade and 
business barriers with the united states as early as new years day 
people will look back on this and say it was a good day for 
canada said prime minister brian mulroney he said the agreement 
which was approved by a vote of 141111 would bring economic 
prosperity 
in washington a us administration trade official welcomed the 
commons vote saying the trade pact would spur economic growth on 
both sides of the border 
were just very pleased the canadian parliament has acted 
positively on the freetrade agreement said kelly winkler 
spokesman for trade representative clayton yeutter 
the agreement was the focus of national elections nov 21 in 
which mulroneys progessive conservative party won a second 
consecutive majority government 
it was a tough road this is a rough business mulroney told 
reporters outside the commons which had met past midnight 
legislators of the opposition liberal party sang o canada 
the canadian national anthem to protest passage of the bill 
members of another opposition group the new democrats were silent 
as they voted against it 
the pact is scheduled to take effect jan 1 after consideration 
by the senate which has promised to approve the legislation next 
week 
under the agreement all remaining tariffs between the two 
neighbors are to be phased out over a 10year period trade between 
the united states and canada was about 160 billion last year 
the opposition bitterly opposed the pact on the ground that it 
would cost canadians jobs after the election the commons was 
recalled dec 12 to deal with the agreement 
mulroney signed the trade agreement with president reagan in 
january it was approved by the us congress

the following is a text of pope john paul 
iis homily for christmas eve midnight mass in st peters basilica 
the original was to be given in italian the following is the 
vaticans official englishlanguage version 
i bring you good news of a great joy for to you is born a 
savior luke 21011 
we hear this voice which emanates from the depths of the night of 
bethlehem the shepherds keeping watch over their flock by night 
luke 28 were the first to hear it for this reason the midnight 
liturgy is sometimes called the shepherds mass 
we are gathered in st peters basilica to hear once more these 
same words i bring you good news of a great joy 
by means of radio and television peoples of different languages 
nations countries and continents are listening with us to this 
message thus again in the different parts of the world 
and even if the words which we hear on christmas night are the 
same every year yet they are always eagerly awaited by us and are 
for us always new 
today is born a savior who is christ the lord he is 
born once more once more he has come into the world on the night 
of bethlehem for we relive as ours that distant today of almost 
2000 years ago 
a savior is born to you it may seem that people have 
achieved a great deal and continue to do so in saving 
themselves with their own resources so that they may be 
selfsufficient that all the things that are termed 
civilization progress and development do not reach the 
roots of the evil which still persists in human history and even in 
a sense is becoming deeper and more widespread and on the other 
hand all the things that help to raise the level of human 
existence that make it better do not reach the perfection of 
that good to which the human being is directed 
meanwhile the words a savior is born to you continue to 
touch what is permanent and real in man what is profoundly true 
and every year these words are awaited with the same basic 
motivations in our humanity even if we are very often unaware of 
them 
on that night the shepherds in bethlehem experienced deep 
amazement what they heard at first filled them with fear but do 
not be afraid the messenger says i bring you good news of great 
joy 
at the moment in which god the son of the same substance as the 
father is born as man comes into the world as a son of man as the 
son of mary we cannot but be overcome by deep amazement the whole 
gospel is the book of great amazement 
for god is eternal and invisible he is allembracing in him 
we live and move and have our being acts 1728 god is 
omnipotent he is totally other different from the whole of 
creation he is absolute transcendence 
is it possible that he becomes man that he is born in an 
abandoned stable as a child of homeless parents 
why cur deus homo why did god become man 
the night of bethlehem is the wellspring of this amazement the 
first to experience it were these shepherds and in this amazement 
there was first fear and then joy it is not something transitory 
it is preserved by the human consciousness for the whole of life 
every individual must constantly ask the question cur deus homo 
he must constantly seek the answer and find it gradually he must 
embrace the mystery revealed this night and enter into it ever more 
deeply 
yes the mystery 
it is good when one experiences fear an interior tremor and it 
is also good when one finds joy but it is not good when one or the 
other is missing it is not good man cannot remain indifferent to 
the mystery of the night of bethlehem he cannot reject the question 
cur deus homo 
this would constitute a deep wound in his humanity 
thus all people are called to share in this night declare 
his glory among the nations his marvelous works among all the 
peoples see also psalms 95963 
in the context of the christmas mystery human history the 
history of each and every individual is called to overcome that 
limit which can interiorly obstruct the journey towards the 
salvation offered by god people can ignore this call they can even 
refuse to accept it but salvation cannot come to them except 
from god and it has come on this very night 
god is born as man who is a creature does not the whole of 
creation find its place in this mystery 
what significance has the fact that we invite earth and sea to 
share in the joy of christmas 
let the heavens be glad and let the earth rejoice let the sea 
roar and all that fills let the field exult and everything in it 
then shall all the trees of the wood sing for joy psalms 
95961112 
bethlehem it literally means the house of bread 
christ who was born there without a roof will construct in the 
history of the world a dwelling which corresponds to the meaning of 
this place bethlehem 
the house of bread the eucharist 
he himself the savior will live in this house in a sacramental 
manner indeed he will actually be this house his body and his 
blood the whole of humanity in which the divine transformation of 
man has its origin 
in this way man will constantly be able to overcome the limit 
placed in the way of salvation eternal salvation which god 
himself has opened up with the human birth of the word his eternal 
son with the human birth of god 
truly 
the people who walked in darkness have seen a great light 
those who dwelt in a land of deep darkness on them has light 
shined isiah 91 
truly 
fear not behold i bring you good news of great joy

the polisario front announced saturday it 
is sending a toplevel delegation to meet moroccos king hassan ii 
it would be the first such encounter since polisario guerrillas went 
to war with morocco 13 years ago 
no date for the meeting or names of delegates were given 
the statement issued here by the polisario front said the 
initiative follows a declaration by the moroccan monarch to the 
french press that he was ready to meet polisario officials 
the group called hassans statement a constructive position 
taken in response to repeated calls by the polisario for dialogue 
the talks would be the first direct contacts between morocco and 
the polisario or its political structure the saharawi arab 
democratic republic since the guerrilla group began fighting 
morocco for independence for the western sahara annexed by morocco 
in 1975 
the polisario statement said the group would cooperate fully with 
the organization of african unity and the united nations which have 
been seeking a peaceful solution to the conflict 
both morocco and the polisario have agreed in principle to a 
referendum on the future of the western sahara 
however the statement reiterated polisarios stance that 
moroccan troops and administration in the disputed territory remain 
an obstacle to the process and should be removed 
polisario declared the western sahara a republic in february 
1976 it has since been recognized by 45 countries 27 of them 
organization of african unity members 
morocco quit the group in 1980 when the saharawi arab democratic 
republic became a member

christmas came early this year for a disabled 
boy who told santa the only gift he wanted was a wheelchair for his 
mom 
a motorized wheelchair arrived friday from buffalo ny for 
victoria coslett 39 weeks ago it appeared that ms coslett and 
her 10yearold son john wonggoun would not celebrate christmas 
with his mother confined to their apartment and unable to 
maneuver her old wheelchair outdoors to watch him play wonggoun 
wrapped empty boxes to place under the sparsely decorated christmas 
tree then sat down and wrote santa 
his letter said the only gift i would like is an elecric 
wheelchair for my mom she cant walk and her hands are to weak for 
the one welfair gave her 2 years ago i would love to see her 
outside without help and watch me play can you help me with my 
wish 
the note made it as far as the us postal service in palm 
springs where denise reusche a clerk opened the letter 
each year the post office in the desert resort processes about 
1000 letters to santa workers usually send a letter in return 
but when ms reusche read johns letter she decided to contact 
fortress scientific co a buffalo wheelchair manufacturer which 
shipped the gift 
ms coslett and john were injured in a 1981 traffic crash she 
was left with ruptured spinal discs john was partially brain 
damaged and suffers recurring seizures and memory lapses he also 
has juvenile arthritis

a convenience store clerk was treated to a 
little adult entertainment when a man stripped down to a gstring 
and leather jacket and bumped and ground his way down the candy 
aisle 
circle k clerk annette ochoa said a man entered the store about 3 
am friday and asked if he could use the restroom she told him 
this wasnt permitted to customers and the man smiled and left 
but minutes later he returned while she was talking on the phone 
when i looked up he was standing there with nothing but a 
gstring and leather jacket on ochoa said i told my friend 
ive got a stripper ill have to call the cops 
once the stripper had her attention he began performing 
he walked up picked up a thrifty nickel newspaper and did 
some pumping motions if you know what i mean ochoa said 
then he went down one aisle and then came up the candy aisle 
and stood in front of the candy counter and did some more of his 
motions he heard me say i was calling the police but he just stood 
there until i dialed the numbers then he left 
the stripper didnt know when to quit his act though he was 
arrested on a complaint of indecent exposure shortly after he 
appeared outside another convenience store he was released without 
any charge being filed but police are still investigating 
i was talking to my friend at a second store when she spotted 
the guy walking around outside her store ochoa said about that 
time a cop walked in to ask me some followup questions and i told 
him what was going on he radioed it in and a cop who was nearby 
caught him near the store on lakeshore drive he was only wearing 
his gstring and a leather jacket 
ochoa says the strip show was something of a shock still she 
believes something good came from his performance 
it kept me awake

the soviet union opened talks saturday with the 
exiled king of afghanistan about a new peace plan for the wartorn 
country officials said 
yuli vorontsov soviet ambassador to afghanistan and a first 
deputy foreign minister said the talks with the exiled king focused 
on a proposal for convening a council in afghanistan of 50 to 60 
politicians or prominent individuals to create a new government 
afghan rebels have spoken recently about forming a broadbased 
government to succeed the sovietbacked regime but vorontsovs 
comments were the most detailed yet made publicly about the new 
proposal 
the soviet official said his government had presented the plan to 
pakistanbased moslem rebels earlier this month and we are still 
waiting for their word 
vorontsov said the twohour session saturday with former king 
mohammad zaher shah was very useful zaher shah has lived in 
italy since he was overthrown in 1973 
we had a very long extensive discussion which covered lots of 
elements of the plan of the future of possibilities he told 
reporters at the residence of the soviet ambassador to rome 
he declined however to say whether the king was receptive to 
going back to afghanistan as part of a transitional government 
while the 74yearold exking still has a following in 
afghanistan some moslem resistance groups remain strongly opposed 
to him 
the soviets are anxious to see a stable government in place that 
will end the 10yearold afghanistan war and not persecute afghan 
communists 
moscow signed an accord with the united states in april under 
which the soviets are to withdraw their estimated 115000 troops 
from afghanistan by feb 15 1989 
however moscow has since suspended the pullout charging that 
there have been violations of the accords by the united states and 
pakistan who back the rebels the war has continued 
vorontsov declared that the different afghan groups had to start 
negotiating with each other 
there is a suggestion that comes from pakistan that the first 
initial group of representatives of all kinds of political factions 
5060 persons get together in the capacity of the representatives 
of political parties or in their personal capacity as authoritative 
figures but sitting together starting to formulate the future of 
afghanistan he said 
he added that the group should form a ruling body or 
administrative council that would govern until new elections could 
be called 
vorontsov said the plan had the approval of some rebels the 
pakistani government and the afghan government he said it would be 
presented shortly to afghan rebel groups based in iran 
the new ruling council could be put together by feb 15 he said 
vorontsov also said that several afghan rebel groups were holding 
secret talks with the sovietbacked najib government the 
pakistanbased rebels have vowed never to deal with najib 
in an address to the united nations earlier this month soviet 
president mikhail gorbachev proposed a jan 1 ceasefire in 
afghanistan and a cutoff of all military supplies to the country 
we still think that it is feasible to work with that target 
date in mind vorontsov said 
there was no comment from the former afghan king about saturdays 
meeting which took place at his walled compound in rome his 
spokesman gen abdul wali told reporters that the soviet official 
had been received for an exchange of views 
in the past zaher shah has been guarded in his public 
statements saying that afghan leaders should be assembled to decide 
on a transition team 
afghanistan has been locked in civil war since the april 1978 
revolution that brought a socialist government to power in the 
islamic nation 
soviet troops were sent to the neighboring country in 1979 to 
prop up the allied government 
zaher shah lost his throne when his cousin and former prime 
minister mohammed daud seized power in july 1973 the king who 
had been in power for 40 years was in italy at the time taking a 
rheumatism cure at the baths in ischia 
leftists in the army supported the coup and anticommunist exiles 
believe it paved the way for the more openly prosoviet coup in 1978

authorities in a district where 
independent groups this month held their first legal rally in almost 
20 years have called the rally antisocialist and banned such 
gatherings in the future a newspaper said saturday 
the communist party daily rude pravo said the ban was decided at 
a meeting thursday of officials from pragues third district close 
to the city center and organizers of the dec 10 rally marking 40 
years of the universal declaration of human rights 
in the peaceful hourlong rally called by five unofficial 
groups wellknown independent activists addressed a public crowd 
for the first time since the end of 1968s prague spring reforms 
several speeches called for peaceful changes in the current 
system at the end a crowd of about 3000 approved a declaration 
calling for the release of all political prisoners full religious 
freedom legalization of groups independent of the ruling communist 
party and a new constitution 
rude pravo said the organizers of the dec 10 meeting were told 
openly they did not adhere to the conditions under which they got 
permission for the public gathering 
the content of slogans and some of the performances stepped 
outside the boundaries of this covenant wrote rude pravo 
commentator marie boudova 
the rally was aimed against socialist order and proved the real 
intention of organizers to misuse the gathering for political 
provocation she said 
the decision was preceded by publication in rude pravo dec 15 
and 16 of readers letters attacking the dec 10 meeting 
we cannot and must not let czech walesas infringe upon the 
legal order and what is worse trifle with serious questions of 
democracy and justice wrote one reader dec 16 referring to 
solidarity leader lech walesa of poland 
petr uhl one of the activists involved in negotiations with the 
authorities before the dec 10 gathering said there had been no 
mention then of limits on the content of slogans or speeches at the 
rally 
it is false quite false that we the independent groups have 
violated such conditions he said 
uhl said neither of the two activists who met with authorities on 
thursday were in prague over the christmas weekend

a man jailed on drug charges got to go 
home for christmas after a judge threatened to jail his own cousin 
the chief criminal deputy in the sheriffs office for refusing to 
allow the furlough 
im obeying the rules but im protesting them chief 
criminal deputy ralph stassi said after carl scioneaux 27 of white 
castle was released friday on a court order from state district 
judge jack marionneaux 
marionneauxs threat to send stassi to jail is not the first 
public rift between the cousins the judge who ordered stassi out 
of his court in 1985 after the chief deputy lambasted him during a 
hearing said his cousin has a grudge against him 
the judge said sheriff freddie h pitre sr often lets prisoners 
out and scioneaux is a local boy who is unlikely to jump bail 
stassi said scioneaux arrested nov 27 for possessing cocaine 
and marijuana with intent to distribute them has been arrested 
repeatedly and didnt merit a weekend pass 
the clerk of courts office said scioneaux was convicted in 1984 
of burglary and in 1986 of marijuana possession 
scioneaux was being held on 60000 bond when marionneaux asked 
for his release on a weekend pass stassi said the sheriff refused 
that request friday morning stassi said 
but when marionneaux called later the judge threatened to jail 
his cousin stassi said 
marionneaux said that because it was christmas he changed the 
bond so scioneaux could be released on his own recognizance 
all of this goes back on him at 9 am monday its just a 
weekend pass the judge said

the mayor of bethlehem in a 
christmas message proposed a oneyear truce between the jewish 
state and palestinians struggling against israeli occupation 
mayor elias freij also said saturday that he hopes israel would 
accept the land for peace formula in middle east peace talks 
we hope the israeli government will become more realistic and 
accept territory for peace rather than the concept of territory 
with peace he said on israel radio 
he proposed a unsponsored agreement to end violence in the 
occupied territories and clashes between the israeli and allied 
forces and palestinian guerrillas in lebanon 
the palestinians would be happy to accept a honorable truce it 
would be a great moral victory for them he said in an interview 
published friday in the weekend edition of the jerusalem post daily 
freij proposed that the truce be signed by israel and plo chief 
yasser arafat israels new coalition government rules out talks 
with the plo which it considers a terrorist organization 
under freijs proposed accord the yearlong palestinian rebellion 
against israeli rule in the occupied west bank and gaza strip would 
come to a halt 
at least 333 palestinians and 14 israelis have been killed since 
violence broke out in the occupied lands on dec 8 1987 
in return freij said the bulk of israeli troops would have to 
withdraw from these territories which israel captured in the 1967 
middle east war 
israel would also release 1450 palestinians now held in 
adminitrative detention reopen 20 universities and colleges in the 
occupied lands cancel expulsion orders against palestinians and 
stop the practice of house demolitions as punishment for guerrilla 
activities 
we have to be more optimistic that next year there will be 
more hope freij told the radio 
he spoke as christmas eve began in the palestinian city of 
35000 the birthplace of jesus and carols reverberated over 
loudspeakers across manger square but christian pilgrims were 
discouraged by drenching rain heavy israeli security and 
palestinian general strike 
in the newspaper interview freij was quoted as saying his idea 
could lay the groundwork for an international peace forum leading to 
an agreement on internationally defined borders where both israel 
and palestine each can live in peace 
israel has raised different interim ideas to launch peace talks 
ranging from elections in the occupied lands to choose palestinian 
negotiators acceptable both to it and the plo to unilateral 
autonomy or limited selfrule for palestinians 
but it says violence in the west bank and gaza must stop before 
any such negotiations start arafat on the other hand has said 
repeatedly that the palestinian uprising will continue as liberation 
struggle 
prime minister yitzhak shamir said on israeli radio that he 
didnt know of any member of this government who accepts 
negotiations with the plo what we are seeking is direct 
negotiations with various arab countries and the palestinian arab 
population 
in downtown tel aviv thousands of israelis gathered under a 
pouring rain at a city square to demand peace talks with the plo 
the demonstration was led by the leftist peace now movement and was 
attended by many leftwing legislators 
demonstrators held signs readingtalk peace with the plo now 
and two countries for the two people 
speakers urged the government to adopt a peace strategy based on 
the recent us decision to launch a dialogue with the plo and what 
they termed a change in the plo approach towards israel

before its selfimposed dec 31 deadline for selling the paper or 
folding it a cox official said 
cox might consider keeping the paper open for a short time after 
dec 31 if a deal appears imminent said david easterly president 
of the atlantabased cox newspapers division

no effect on the negotiations

lockerbie scotland authorities found 84 more bodies saturday 
from the crash of pan am flight 103 as this griefstricken little 
village tried to keep christmas from being erased from its calendar 
police chief john boyd said there would be no scaling down of the 
search until the bodies of all 258 people aboard the boeing 747 and 
those who died on the ground are located 
helicopters and more than 600 people searched miles of scottish 
countryside for victims of wednesday nights crash which showered 
this quiet town with flames and shards of jagged metal 
among the dead is the cias station chief in beirut lebanon 
us officials said saturday 
in the town of 2500 people shops remained open and churches 
held christmas eve services but the heart had gone out of the 
holiday the rev patrick keegans of the towns roman catholic 
church whose own home was destroyed in the crash put christmas 
preparations aside saturday to meet with relatives of the victims at 
a counseling center in the parish hall 
police spokesman angus kennedy said saturday night that 84 more 
bodies were recovered after the search area was expanded bringing 
the total to 239 
none of the bodies has been positively identified and kennedy 
said it was a fair question whether all the remaining bodies 
will ever be found 
six local residents listed as missing have been located alive and 
one other has been confirmed as dead kennedy said that leaves 10 
townspeople still listed as missing 
he said police also believed the occupants of only two cars 
destroyed in the explosion were missing since what was thought to 
have been a third car was merely a license plate already in the road 
when the disaster occurred 
officials earlier had not accounted for occupants of two other 
cars caught in the inferno but said saturday that one driver had 
been treated for injuries and the other already was on the list of 
the missing 
searchers extended their hunt to more than 30 miles east of 
lockerbie papers clothing money and mail from the plane had been 
found as far away as the northumberland coast 70 miles east of the 
main crash site 
investigators were examining the flights cockpit recording 
which ended with what they called a brief mysterious faint 
noise 
suspicions of sabotage were prompted by the inexplicable sudden 
breakup of the plane at 31000 feet a claim of responsibility and 
disclosures that the us government had been warned of a plot to 
bomb a pan am flight between frankfurt west germany and new york 
in december 
passengers and luggage of flight 103 originated on a boeing 727 
in frankfurt and switched to a boeing 747 in london the plane was 
bound for new york when it crashed 
but british aviation authorities who are leading the crash 
probe say the cause still is unknown and there is no evidence to 
suggest a bomb blew up the plane 
in washington meanwhile two us officials said the central 
intelligence agencys station chief in beirut lebanon was on the 
flight one of the two officials who spoke on condition of 
anonymity said there was no indication the station chiefs presence 
was connected to the crash 
the cia official was not identified 
the mourning continued throughout christmas eve in the village 
christmas is really the furthest thing from my mind right now 
its not important said joe horgan an american who had come to 
the village where a relative had died in wednesday nights crash 
horgan one of about 20 people who lost loved ones and came to 
the crash scene in southwestern scotland met briefly with reporters 
saturday on condition that his hometown and any details about his 
relative on the flight not be disclosed 
beneath the fanciful turreted tower of the town hall a growing 
pile of flowers testified to grief 
one of the three dozen bunches including christmas holly that 
had been placed there said god bless you melina we love you 
always your father and mother 
a notice board carried condolences from prince charles and 
princess diana and from president reagan 
in london queen elizabeth ii broadcast an unprecedented second 
christmas message saturday to comfort those who suffered in the pan 
am jet crash the dec 7 earthquake in soviet armenia and the dec 
12 rail crash in south london that killed 34 people 
she offered prayers and sympathy to the injured and bereaved and 
said she hoped the eternal message of christmas will bring some 
comfort in the hour of sadness

the central intelligence agencys station chief 
in beirut lebanon was among the 258 people aboard the pan american 
jumbo jet that exploded and crashed in scotland two us officials 
said saturday 
but there is no known reason to believe that he was a specific 
target of terrorists or that his presence on flight 103 was tied in 
any other way to the disaster one of the officials told the 
associated press i dont know of any specific link the 
official said 
for the record the reagan administration declined to verify or 
deny that the cia agent was aboard the jetliner as initially 
reported by nbc news as you know we never comment on any such 
allegation having to do with intelligence sondra mccarty a state 
department spokeswoman said 
but two other us officials who spoke on condition of 
anonymity confirmed the cia station chief was on the illfated 
flight from londons heathrow airport to new york the two would not 
identify the station chief 
american british israeli and interpol investigators are trying 
to determine whether the plane was the victim of sabotage technical 
malfunction or high winds all aboard perished and 20 people who 
resided near the crash site were missing and believed dead 
flight recorders recovered from the wreckage on friday showed the 
pilots engaged in routine conversation with no warning signs 
apparent before the wednesday night crash the tape ended abruptly 
with a short faint noise 
the loss of the cia station chief in beirut is the latest setback 
to us intelligence operations in lebanon in april 1983 a 
terrorist bomb that wrecked the us embassy in beirut took the 
lives of a number of cia agents in 1984 william buckley the us 
station chief was kidnapped tortured and killed probably the next 
year 
the impact on us intelligencegathering and information about 
american hostages was immeasurable the state department lists nine 
americans currently as hostages officials on thursday denied 
reports any of the victims in the crash had been engaged in 
negotiations to secure their freedom 
a little more than two weeks before the crash a caller 
identifying himself with the radical palestinian abu nidal group 
telephoned a warning to the us embassy in helsinki that a pan am 
passenger jet bound from frankfurt west germany to new york via 
london would be attacked 
the state department said thursday it sent out a security alert 
still some us officials complained privately that insufficient 
precautions were taken and that servicemen traveling home for the 
holidays had not been informed 
after the crash several callers to news organizations claimed 
their groups were responsible for the attack 
the us embassy in beirut operates on a scaleddown basis 
because of the intermittent strife in the country among rival 
groups it is not unusual for the us government to assign a cia 
official to such a sensitive post 
cia agents in the past have been the targets of extremists in an 
effort to shield them the state department in 1975 ceased 
publishing the names of employees at us embassies 
the state department said on friday that three of its employees 
were aboard two stationed in beirut and the third at the us 
embassy in nicosia cyprus 
presidentelect bush declined to comment on the situation i 
know nothing about it he said in a questionandanswer session 
with reporters outside his residence 
asked if either of the two officials in beirut had worked for the 
cia ms mccarty said we did not identify them further even if i 
had such information we would not release it 
us intelligence officers abroad usually adopt cover 
positions as diplomats 
the two in beirut were matthew k gannon of orange calif and 
ronald lariviere of holyoke mass the state department said 
gannon was assigned to the near east bureau and was returning 
home after completing an assignment in beirut as a political 
officer he had previously worked in north yemen jordan and syria 
lariviere of holyoke mass had been working in beirut as a 
security officer while daniel e oconnor of boston had a similar 
job in nicosia the department said 
cia officials did not return repeated telephone queries

a score of others on the ground

pope john paul ii heralded the birth of jesus 
christ in a midnight mass homily for roman catholics worldwide 
saturday and staterun italian television said the message was 
being broadcast to the soviet union for the first time 
the pope dressed in gold and white robes and carrying a 
crucifix walked into st peters basilica moments before midnight 
at the end of a long cortege of priests at the same time church 
bells chimed all over rome to hail the arrival of christmas 
the pope opened the homily in st peters basilica by quoting 
from luke 21011 i bring you good news of great joy for to you 
is born a savior a text of the homily was issued in advance by 
the vatican 
we hear this voice which emanates from the depths of the night 
of bethlehem the shepherds keeping watch over their flock by 
night were the first to hear it for this reason the midnight 
liturgy is sometimes called the shepherds mass he said 
john paul speaking from the papal altar under the colossal 
bronze canopy designed by bernini noted that people of different 
languages were listening to the same message on radio and television 
broadcasts of the mass to 50 countries 
the pope seated on a white and gold throne in front of the 
altar spoke to a congregation that included cardinals in red 
vestments formally dressed diplomats accredited to the vatican and 
thousands of pilgrims 
an announcer on the staterun rai television network which was 
feeding the mass to other stations and networks around the world 
said the message was being broadcast to the soviet union for the 
first time he did not elaborate 
the soviet union has shown signs of overtures to the roman 
catholic church and its domestic faithful in recent months earlier 
this year officials allowed celebrations to mark the 1000 
anniversary of russian christendom and received a delegation from 
the vatican 
last year the soviets stopped jamming the voice of america a 
radio station operated by the us government on nov 29 they 
stopped interfering with signals of usfunded radio liberty 
in his midnight mass the pope cautioned the faithful not to be 
complacent and to find the true meaning of christmas in the words 
a savior is born to you 
it may seem that people have achieved a great deal and 
continue to do so in saving themselves with their own resources 
so that they be selfsufficient but they are becoming more and more 
convinced that they are not selfsufficient that all the things 
that are termed civilization progress and development do not 
reach the roots of the evil which still persists in human history 
and even in a sense is becoming deeper and more widespread the 
pope said 
meanwhile the words a savior is born to you continue to touch 
what is permanent and real in man what is profoundly true the 
pontiff said 
on sunday the pope was to lead a 1030 am christmas day mass 
in st peters the largest church in christendom 
that mass is followed by the popes traditional christmas day 
message urbi et orbi to the city and to the world 
earlier saturday in what has become a christmas eve custom the 
pope met with fellow poles for the breaking of the oplatek 
paperthin unleavened bread similar to wafers used for communion 
polish families usually begin christmas eve dinner by passing the 
wafer around the table 
during the meeting with his countrymen john paul speaking in 
polish severely criticized what he called the evil traditions of 
the last decades in polish politics

1985 homicides have steadily increased 1385 in 1985 1582 in 
1986 and 1672 last year 
as of last month assistant police chief raymond kelly said about 
42 percent of this years slayings were drugrelated 
these tragic statistics reflect the mayors concern expressed 
over the past 4 years that the federal government ought to do 
something about drugs flooding across our border said mayoral 
spokesman lee jones 
the christmas eve slayings included a 40yearold man stabbed to 
death in his east village apartment an unidentified man shot once

bumped another inside the store 
the problem is not limited to new york in washington there has 
already been a record set for the most homicides ever in a year new 
york ranks 10th in killings per 100000 people said kelly the top

police stormed a prison and crushed an 
uprising by inmates who were denied christmas pardons but the 
warden and 23 other people were killed and six were injured in the 
twoday siege officials said saturday 
there was a fierce gunfight lasting about 15 minutes before the 
special forces could quell the mutiny on friday night said police 
officer sergio anzaldo who was on duty when the commandos attacked 
the prison 
it was quite violent he said in a telephone interview 
authorities have arrested four inmates and three prison guards 
suspected of complicity in the uprising a state government 
spokesman said saturday 
one of the arrested guards hospitalized with minor wounds was 
earlier considered one of 20 hostages rescued friday night when 
police stormed the prisons administrative offices and crushed the 
uprising said francisco flores a spokesman for nayarit state 
government 
the other two guards were not there during the uprising but they 
may have allowed inmates and two outsiders into the office area 
thursday morning the state official said 
anzaldo said 130 commandos flown in from mexico city stormed the 
prison after a group of inmates had held 14 prison employees and 
visiting relatives hostage for 32 hours an earlier attempt to storm 
the prison friday was repulsed 
the uprising began thursday after the mutinous prisoners were 
denied pardons given at christmas to inmates with good behavior 
flores said a preliminary report showed the mutiny began when 
about six inmates arrived at the wardens office thursday to protest 
denial of the pardons 
two welldressed visitors posing as lawyers approached the 
building at the same time and took out guns flores said they had 
entered the prison without being searched 
the hostages were held in administrative offices and the rest of 
the 1200 inmates remained under control throughout the uprising on 
the outskirts of tepic the nayarit state capital 500 miles 
northwest of mexico city 
the death toll from the original confrontation thursday morning 
and the raids friday night was 24 samuel alvarado the 31yearold 
warden of venustiano carranza penitentiary jorge armando duarte 
head of the fox commando unit 19 prisoners and three unidentified 
people presumed to be prisoners flores said 
alvarado was killed in a shootout when the inmates tried to seize 
the wardens office thursday officials said he was reported to 
have bled to death from a leg wound 
authorities were still trying to determine exactly how many 
inmates were ultimately involved in the uprising and how the 
firearms were brought into the prison 
celso humberto delgado ramirez governor of the state of nayarit 
told reporters saturday that the immediate deployment of 200 state 
police had kept hundreds of visiting relatives and officials from 
being trapped by the uprising but some relatives were among the 
hostages 
anzaldo said red cross volunteers recovered the bodies after the 
assault and were not immediately sure about their identities a 
prisoner provided initial identifications 
duarte was shot shortly before nightfall friday when he went 
into the prison compound and tried to talk the inmates into 
surrendering the answer was a hail of bullets which killed him 
instantly a state official said 
about two hours later police lobbed dozens of tear gas canisters 
into the penitentiary and rushed it with automatic weapons blazing 
an undetermined number of people died in the raid which was 
unsuccessful 
about 11 pm friday the commandos staged a second raid which 
killed more people and succeeded said the official who spoke on 
condition of anonymity 
at least two people besides the prison warden and commando leader 
were killed before special forces stormed the inmates he said 
anzaldo said the prisons security force had been doubled and

lottery players had visions of dollar signs 
dancing in their heads on christmas eve and kept machines across the 
state humming late saturday including one spot that has become 
something of a lottery shrine 
the liquor rack in the southeastern town of robinson has earned 
its reputation as a lucky lottery outlet after selling winning 
tickets four times with an estimated 37 million grand prize on the 
line saturday the third largest ever offered in illinois many 
lottery players made a special pilgrimage to the store 
the winning numbers picked saturday evening were 8 9 27 33 43 
and 54 lottery officials said they wont announce whether anyone 
matched all six numbers until sunday and because of the holiday 
the validation of winners if there are any will wait until tuesday 
theyre hanging out the door said gene wilkin owner of the 
liquor rack we cant give the thing machine a break 
the business that sells the winning ticket receives a bonus equal 
to 1 percent of the winnings of wilkins four bonuses the last two 
came only a month apart in july and august 
everybody on the road stops to see us said wilkin we had 
a few people come down from champaign 100 miles away just to pick 
up their tickets 
state lottery spokeswoman kathy rem wasnt surprised with 
average sales of 1 million tickets an hour since early saturday 
morning she said most ticket outlets were likely very busy 
we werent sure how wed do on christmas eve but i guess the 
public has answered that question she said business is 
booming 
the 37 million prize is the result of three previous weekend 
drawings without any player matching all six numbers drawn from 
among 54 possible while the state lottery guarantees 5 million for 
each weekend drawing and rolls that amount over the big increases 
come when there are more than the usual number of tickets sold 
business also was brisk at docs liquor store the northwest 
chicago suburban shop owned by mike wittkowski the onetime printer 
who won the largestever prize of 40 million four years ago 
mike still plays but i dont know whether hes playing this 
one or not it seems like everybody else is though said dino 
pappas wittkowskis brotherinlaw and the manager of the store 
sales are big real big 
the secondlargest illinois prize of 39 million was claimed nov 
5 by former state rep james soper of cicero 
ms rem said there has also been a 35 million jackpot but that 
was shared by several winners

a palestinian terrorist group said 
saturday it will free two french girls held hostage for more than a 
year in response to an appeal by libyan leader col moammar gadhafi 
that captives be released 
a statement issued by the fatah revolutionary council led by abu 
nidal said the girls to be released are the daughters of french 
hostage jacqueline valente they are marielaure 7 and virginie 6 
the councils statement also called for release of all kidnapped 
hostages in lebanon especially those uninvolved in any espionage 
activity or those serving with humanitarian organizations 
the groups announcement was released a few hours after ms 
valentes mother former husband and brotherinlaw arrived in west 
beirut from paris to press for their relatives freedom 
the statement set no date for their release but the groups 
spokesman walid khaled told the associated press the two girls 
were to be freed within 24 hours 
khaled said in november last year that his group captured the 
three along with five belgians from a french boat it seized off 
the coast of the israelioccupied gaza strip he accused the adults 
of being israeli spies which their relatives deny 
in light of the appeal made by brother moammar gadhafi on the 
occasion of christmas and new year for the release of the hostages 
especially the two girls marielaure and virginie our central 
committee has decided to free the two girls within the framework of 
specific security arrangements set for this purpose the statement 
said 
in april the group offered to release ms valentes older 
daughters but khaled said their mother refused to let them go 
the statement released in beirut did not spell out the security 
arrangements involved nor did it indicate the captives 
whereabouts but it said libya pledged to extend all the necessary 
facilities that will guarantee the safety of the two girls 
the captives are widely believed held in the palestinian refugee 
camp of ein elhilweh outside the southern port of sidon 
ms valentes brotherinlaw andre metral said after the 
statement was released that khaled contacted him at the cavalier 
hotel in west beirut and told him he wanted to see him without 
setting an exact date for the meeting 
but metral said the meeting would most probably take place 
sometime sunday and that khaled had warned him that he does not want 
any reporters present 
ms valente her daughters and the five belgians have been called 
the forgotten hostages by the french media since they are not 
among 15 foreign hostages most commonly mentioned in press reports 
ms valente gave birth to a third daughter in captivity and is 
reportedly expecting a fourth child 
the french and belgians have been held for more than a year by 
fatah revolutionary council a radical guerrilla group led by 
palestinian terrorist abu nidal the belgians being held are 
emmanuel houtekins his wife godelieve their two children 
valerie 16 and laurent 17 and emmanuels brother fernand 
abu nidal also known as sabry banna is widely believed to have 
organized the december 1985 attacks at the rome and vienna airports 
in which 16 people were killed a former official of fatah a 
faction led by plo chief yasser arafat abu nidal split with the plo 
in the early 1970s the fatah revolutionary council is not part of 
the plo 
the statements call for release of hostages doing humanitarian 
work or those not involved in espionage appeared to refer to belgian 
doctor jan cools 32 who disappeared may 21 after leaving his 
apartment in the rashidiyeh palestinian refugee camp near lebanons 
southern port of tyre 
cools worked for the norwegian norwac humanitarian organization 
for three months before he vanished a previously unknown group 
calling itself the soldiers of justice claimed responsibility 
for his abduction dec 18 
with the statement the abu nidal group was apparently trying to 
distance itself from the death threats that led the international 
committee of the red cross to suspend services and evacuate all 
swiss personnel from lebanon this week one of its workers was 
recently kidnapped in sidon and then released 
also saturday friends and relatives of american hostages terry 
anderson and thomas sutherland and british captive john mccarthy 
appealed for their release in christmas letters published in beirut 
newspapers 
the usbased journalists committee to free terry anderson 
called on proiranian shiite moslem extremists to free him and 
sutherland in the name of humanity 
the two americans are among 15 westerners missing in lebanon 
anderson and sutherland are believed held by a proiranian shiite 
group known as the islamic jihad or holy war 
anderson 41 the chief middle east correspondent for the 
associated press is the longestheld of the hostages he was 
kidnapped march 16 1985 
scottishborn sutherland 56 of fort collins colo was acting 
dean of agriculture at the american university in beirut when gunmen 
seized him june 9 1985 
mccarthy 32 of london a producer for the londonbased 
worldwide television news disappeared april 17 1986 no group has

no bones about it josephine mattsons 
christmas tree covered from tip to trunk with 525 goldpainted 
wishbones is one of a kind 
its different said mattson a retired occupational 
therapist people seem to enjoy it theyve never heard of a 
wishbone tree 
mattsons wishbones are no paltry poultry collection either 
although it includes the usual chicken and turkey bones it also has 
fragile pheasant quail and pigeon wishbones tiny as thimbles one 
comes from a golden eagle she said 
some date back decades including the wishbone from the eagle 
which was handed down from a friends grandfather the golden eagles 
are now protected from hunters 
the collection started when mattsons father established a 
poultry farm in the 1930s her mother kept chicken turkey geese 
and duck wishbones from family dinners on a shelf in the family 
kitchen 
the collection took off from there said mattson after a denver 
newspaper reported on the tree some 30 years ago mattson was 
showered with wishbones from wellwishers 
the tree is topped by a big turkey wishbone turned upside down 
with a bell suspended from the prongs 
mattson says the turkey wishbone from this years christmas 
dinner will hang to one side of the golden eagle wishbone making a 
wish for a happy new year

carols filtered through 
loudspeakers and drifted across manger square but few christmas eve 
pilgrims were on hand to hear them in this biblical town where 
soldiers seemed to outnumber celebrants 
a driving rain a palestinian general strike and heavy israeli 
security kept crowds slim as darkness fell troops with automatic 
rifles stood guard on rooftops including that of the church of the 
nativity which marks the site where jesus christ is said to have 
been born 
the few visitors who spent the afternoon in bethlehem huddled 
under manger squares arcade outside shops closed down by striking 
palestinians 
in other parts of the israelioccupied west bank and gaza strip 
five palestinians were reported wounded one in a clash with troops 
and four in a clash with an arab village official accused of 
collaborating with israel arab reports said israel radio quoted 
security sources as saying a family feud was behind the incident 
two arabs also died and three others were wounded as they 
handled an explosive device in the small west bank village of 
marj en naja an army spokesman said the army had no further 
details 
bethlehem was quiet 
arab municipal officials canceled the traditional christmas 
parade in an expression of solidarity with the yearold uprising 
against israeli rule in the occupied west bank and gaza strip 
slogans written on bethlehem walls by the uprisings plobacked 
leadership ordered palestinians to stay at home 
but israeli authorities went ahead with a choir concert before 
midnight mass in st catherines church several hundred tourists 
and christian pilgrims attended the performance but the number was 
a considerable drop from the thousands who normally attend 
silent night sung in german and english by the pueri youth 
chorus from geneva opened the concert 
also on the program was another swiss choir two choirs from 
spain and one from the shiloh baptist church in washington which 
sang let my people go 
the choir director charles w fleming said the song was chosen 
to speak out for freedom from oppression all over the world 
the idea is that people should be free christ came to bring us 
that freedom he said 
official ceremonies began saturday with the arrival of michel 
sabbah the bishop of jerusalem in the afternoon 
sabbah the roman catholic patriarch of jerusalem was greeted in 
manger square by the israeli military governor of bethlehem lt 
col shaltiel levy and the citys mayor elias freij 
the visitors and pilgrims who watched the bishop arrive near the 
mosque of omar were far outnumbered by journalists and hundreds of 
israeli police troops and plainclothes officers 
a leaflet issued earlier this week by the plobacked underground 
leaders of the uprising called for a general strike on christmas 
eve and complained of israeli participation in the christian 
ceremonies 
but israeli officials said they felt it was important to maintain 
the practice more than a century old in which rulers of the 
region greet church leaders as a symbol of the protection offered to 
minority christians in the largely moslem middle east 
the practice was followed by the british and turkish rulers of 
palestine 
sabbah who is the first palestinian appointed bishop of 
jerusalem was led into the church by traditional moslem guards 
wearing red fezzes and carrying curved swords 
hundreds of people crowded into the church to attend after strict 
searches by israeli security guards more than 100 stood outside in 
the rain to watch the mass on a large screen set up on the wall of 
the manger square police station 
holy water was sprinkled at the doorway of the church of the 
nativity as the bishop preceded by altar boys entered amid a clowd 
of incense smoke 
the midnight mass led by sabbah is held each year in st 
catherines basilica next door because the church of the nativity 
built over the grotto where christ was born is run by the greek 
orthodox church the greek orthodox celebrate christmas on jan 6 
the epiphany 
israeli troops blocked all streets around manger square and 
pilgrims had to walk blocks to reach it before they could enter 
they had to pass through metal detectors and were searched by 
israeli security forces 
virginia lankton of lansing mich said she did not mind the 
heavy security because i realize it is for my own safety 
she said her husband died recently and she came to the holy land 
at christmas to realize a lifelong dream 
i was alone and i thought this was a good place to be instead 
of being home alone she said 
father stephen doyle a franciscan priest who is assistant rector 
at the nearby ecumenical institute said he was discouraged by the 
deployment of many israeli soldiers and police around manger square 
its extremely depressing to see something like this the day 
before we celebrate the birth of the prince of peace said the 
philadelphiaborn priest 
there was no violence in heavilyguarded bethlehem but in 
nablus 25 miles north a 21yearold arab man who was shot in the 
head by soldiers last week died of his wounds saturday 
doyle said he thought most arab christians from the west bank 
would probably not attend midnight mass because of the heavy 
security but likely would fill the church on christmas morning 
about 35000 palestinan christians live in the west bank and 
gaza which israel captured in the the 1967 middle east war 
at least 334 palestinians have been killed during the revolt 
fourteen israelis also have been killed

cocaine saturday in the latest action against colombias notorious 
medellin drug cartel officials said 
a 39yearold cuban national also was arrested in the raid 
dubbed operation christmas cola said ralph lochridge a 
spokesman for the us drug enforcement administration he estimated 
the shipment was worth 5 million 
during the holiday season drug traffickers attempt to evade 
detection from law enforcement officials by moving large quantities 
of drugs based on their belief that during the christmas season 
there are fewer agents on duty to catch them lochridge said 
not so for this smuggling operation it was definitely a white 
christmas for the feds 
the cuban national jose thomas alcorta of miami was booked for 
investigation of possession of cocaine for distribution and sale 
lochridge said 
he was arrested in the city of commerce about eight miles 
southeast of downtown after allegedly loading boxes containing the

the seizure was part of a continuing effort by a dea task force 
lochridge said in june the group seized 660 pounds of cocaine from 
alleged members of the medellin cartel he said

lawyer alton maddox jr said saturday he would 
appeal a 1000 fine imposed on him for filing a baseless complaint 
of racism in the states court system 
us district judge michael mukasey found in july that maddoxs 
complaint had no basis in a ruling released friday by the state he 
denied a request by maddox who represented controversial teenager 
tawana brawley to reconsider the fine and ordered the penalty 
maddox who is black complained in the suit that he had to apply 
for permission to represent an indigent defendant while a white 
lawyer received such an appointment without applying first the 
state presented evidence that the white lawyer had to apply as well 
mukasey said 
the judge who noted that the state panel that disciplines 
lawyers was reviewing the case ordered maddox to pay the state 
legal costs of 1000 
maddox charged saturday that the judge also was biased against 
him he said mukasey once was a law partner with nowus attorney 
rudolph w giuliani whom maddox said has absolute hatred of 
myself 
the only rationale that anybody can apply to this ruling is 
that this judge is obviously biased because of his relationship with 
rudy giuliani maddox said 
the courthouse was closed saturday and mukasey could not be 
reached for comment 
ms brawley who is black touched off a nationwide controversy 
after claiming she had been abducted and sexually assaulted for 
several days by up to six white men including one who flashed a 
police badge 
she and her family however refused to cooperate with state 
investigators on the advice of maddox another lawyer c vernon 
mason and the rev al sharpton a state grand jury concluded that 
ms brawley concocted her story

oil off the southwestern washington coast was towed into port 
saturday after a leak was plugged while volunteers cleaned up 
oilcoated birds left in its wake 
ive heard people mutter merry christmas but i dont think 
they meant it said kirk thomas of the washington conservation 
corps one of those who looked for injured birds on the beach 
ron holcomb of the state department of ecology said more than 300 
birds were brought in saturday for cleaning at a rescue station set 
up in a church in nearby hoquiam but 130 were found dead or could 
not be saved sixty birds were found dead friday night officials 
said 
crews stopped working late saturday but planned to resume 
efforts early sunday morning holcomb said there were encouraging 
reports that some of the oil was dissipating in the ocean he said 
holcomb said oil came ashore along a threemile stretch of ocean 
beach on the jetty at the north entrance to grays harbor northward 
to ocean shores there were reports of oilcovered birds as far 
north as moclips 15 miles north of here and a few from south of 
the grays harbor entrance said holcomb 
he said the birds were openocean birds mostly common murres 
and came ashore only because they were stricken by the spill there 
was no telling how many birds were harmed he said 
the barge loaded with 27 million gallons of heavy oil began 
leaking thursday night after it was struck by the tug towing it 
just one tank which held 250000 gallons was affected and the 
spill was estimated at 70000 gallons officials said 
an emergency patch could not be placed on the barge until early 
saturday because of rough seas 
oil seeped into grays harbor and up the northern part of the 
inlet as the leaking barge was towed south friday night to the mouth 
of the columbia river 
wildlife department spokesman doug zimmer said that within grays 
harbor there were traces of oil at the oyhut wildlife recreation 
area and heavier concentrations on sand and goose islands 
the islands are used as resting spots by harbor seals but there 
was no immediate evidence any seals were harmed 
meanwhile the barge arrived at astoria ore just inside the 
mouth of the columbia about midday saturday said coast guard lt 
cmdr guy nolan of portland ore 
the level of oil and seawater in the damaged compartment was 
lowered by pumping to other compartments on the barge and the 
temporary patch in the gashed tank was strengthened nolan said 
eventually nolan said the barge would be towed to portland 
where it would be drained and a permanent patch installed 
the barge is owned by sause bros ocean towing inc of coos bay 
ore which hired a company to begin cleanup operations said dick 
lauer manager of bulk products for sause 
sause bros has operated coastal barges for more than 40 years

the government has declared a holiday 
amnesty freeing 26 political prisoners including a leading 
journalist held three months without formal charges lawyers for 
the inmates said saturday 
the defense forces headed by the nations de facto leader gen 
manuel antonio noriega issued a news release later saturday 
confirming their release over the past week and calling it a 
goodwill gesture 
the government says the prisoners had acted against state 
security 
among those released was alberto conte president of the 
panamanian association of journalists he was set free early 
saturday and flew to miami his lawyer rogelio cruz said in a 
telephone interview 
conte and the other prisoners had illegally been held without 
trial since september lawyers for the inmates said 
all the released prisoners belong to the civic crusade a 
coalition of 190 political parties business and professional 
groups and student and labor unions opposed to noriega 
most of the prisoners besides conte also belonged to the 
opposition authentic panamanian party 
the party is a member of the civic crusade which has been 
agitating for months to force noriega to step down as chief of the 
defense forces a position he uses to control the nations 
government 
noriega has been indicted by us federal grand juries on charges 
of drug trafficking and money laundering earlier this year the 
reagan administration froze panamanian assets in us banks and 
imposed economic sanctions against panama in an unsuccessful effort 
to oust noriega 
the united states still recognizes eric arturo delvalle as 
panamas lawful president in february noriega allies in the 
legislative assembly forced delvalle from office and named manuel 
solis palma as his successor 
in another act of christmas amnesty solis palma reduced 
sentences for 240 common criminals without records of drug 
involvement officials said 
the government decision made by the executive follows the 
christmas spirit that is in the hearts of the panamanian people in 
commemoration of the birth of the son of god and the start of the 
new year the defense forces news release said

traces of cocaine were discovered in the 
washington hotel room of a former city employee who was visited by 
mayor marion barry the washington post reported 
however the newspaper in sundays editions quoted a narcotics 
officer as saying the test results did not necssarily indicate that 
drugs were present in the room recently 
barry said it was purely coincidental that he visited 
acquaintance charles lewis at his hotel room thursday at about the 
time police were checking allegations lewis had offered drugs to 
maids in exchange for sex 
i would never knowingly associate with with anybody using drugs 
or dealing with drugs barry was quoted as saying through a 
spokesman under no circumstances would i associate with anybody 
doing this
